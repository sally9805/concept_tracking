At San Clemente , the heavy surf pounding below Richard Nixon 's clifftop redoubt was shrouded by the early morning fog last week , and inside his secluded den the President was perhaps more solitary than ever before . With a swivel of his big chair , he could have seen for himself what his former aide , John Dean , was saying before the Senate Watergate committee . But the television screen remained blank . <P> Nixon sent word through White House Spokesman Gerald Warren ( see THE PRESS ) that he had not watched Dean at all-either in the live hearings or in snatches on the network news programs . There is , of course , no way to be certain of this fact , reported TIME Correspondent Bonnie Angelo , since the President was alone every morning in the den ( elegantly furnished at Government expense ) , and did not drive over to the adjoining presidential office in the Western White House compound until 9:30 or 10 . But the story rings true ; it is hard to imagine Richard Nixon listening to himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Warren , was " very good " ; he discussed the business at hand " with determination . " But after the upbeat and invigorating week of the Brezhnev summit , Nixon found himself hemmed in by Dean 's relentless Watergate testimony on one hand and on the other by a recalcitrant Congress determined to force him to stop bombing Cambodia . <P> With his old lieutenants gone , Nixon had to deal with a new staff that has not yet shaken down into a smoothly functioning team . As the week passed , it became increasingly clear that the President has replaced the old " Berlin Wall " of Haldeman and Ehrlichman with a new wall of Alexander Haig and Ronald Ziegler . Deputy Press Secretary Warren , who has taken over many of Ziegler 's customary duties while Ziegler spends his time working with the President on unspecified matters , reported that Nixon had not so much as talked on the telephone with his counsels in charge of the Watergate problem , J. Fred Buzhardt and Leonard Garment . That doubtless contributed to the confusion over the nature and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committee . <P> <P> As usual , the President was sealed off from any firsthand range of opinion and advice . But in this case the elaborate exercise in isolation was perhaps part of a deliberate attempt to put as much distance as possible between the presidency and the Watergate revelations . The complicated filtering process was almost bizarre . Every day three White House aides back in Washington monitored the hearings . Then the verbatim transcripts were transmitted to the Western White House . From these , Haig , who reportedly had not watched the hearings either , boiled down a summary for the President .
