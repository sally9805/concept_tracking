THE TALK , OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment NOT long ago , we had occasion to remark that , because of the world 's interdependence , wealthy people who consumed too much food or oil in one part of the globe would actually be taking it out of the hands of people in other parts of the globe . Then we came upon news of a man to whom this statement had no application . He was Private Teruo Nakamura , of the Japanese Imperial Army , who had spent the last thirty years in hiding in the jungle on the Indonesian island of Morotai , and who was lured hack to civilization , in December , by a group singing the Japanese national anthem near his hiding place . Nakamura , who was reported to he in excellent physical condition , had survived on A diet of homegrown potatoes and wild bananas . If Nakamura ate twice as many potatoes one year , no one starved in some other part of the globe as a result . And if wealthy people somewhere on the globe ate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not starve . He , like any other person or tribe that has managed to survive in isolation on our highly organized planet , stood outside the manifold crises that everybody has been reading about in recent months . We thought of Nakamura again when we read another recent bit of news : Secretary of State Henry Kissinger 's intimation , in an interview printed in Business Week , that the United States might use military force in the Middle East if the cumulative actions of the oil cartel should eventually threaten " strangulation of the industrialized world . " We were n't ready to set off into the jungle to get away from the energy crisis , but Nakamura 's successful thirty years away from civilization , with its interdependence and its crises , did make us start to wonder just what the perilous military moves that Mr. Kissinger was willing to contemplate would be about . We recalled that it was just lately that the conditions for an oil crisis had ripened . On the one hand , the condi tions of this particular crisis were not , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the long term to the point where the flow of oil would inevitably begin to decline  --  although one day that point will be reached  --  nor were they , on the other hand , simply a sudden increase in economic unscrupulousness and political recklessness in the Arab world , as is also sometimes suggested . The conditions that made the oil crisis possible were the rise in demand for oil in the last decade or so among certain industrialized nations  --  to the point where those nations came to depend specifically on Middle Eastern oil for much of their economic growth . When this point of dependence was reached , the oil producers ' quasi monopoly became feasible , and the embargo and the price rises followed . Keeping in mind the recent origin of this particular crisis  --  the crisis that Mr. Kissinger may be prepared to risk war over  --  one can give an answer of sorts to the question of what the war would he about . It would be about whether we , the industrialized nations , would be allowed to maintain the amount of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imported oil over the last few years  --  or , to put it differently , it would he about the amount of development we would now have to give up in order to end our dependence on imported oil . The years in which the industrialized nations ' dependence grew , of course , did not witness the disappearance of poverty ; more characteristically , they were years in which families who were already well-off bought their place in the country or their second car . In the case of the United States , at least , the use of imported oil has spelled the difference between abundance and superabundance , and no one has suggested that a return to poverty would he required to end our dependence , and thereby avoid the threat of war . A fifty-five-mile-an-hour speed limit has been imposed here . No one has suggested a speed limit of thirty . Yet Americans know that the war that Mr. Kissinger 's contemplation of the use of force implies could be the one that reduces the speed limit of us all to zero . In other words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the Indonesian jungle , as it were  --  what the industrialized world seems to have done is to build an interdependent system that is technically precocious but politically backward . One product of the system is the prosperity now enjoyed by the world 's rich nations ; another product is the proliferation of nuclear warheads that now sit in silos in five or six countries and threaten to put an end to all countries . This system 's promise is that of superabundance ; its peril that of extinction . Mr. Kissinger 's statement seems to mean that this nation is ready to risk extinction in order to guarantee superabundance  --  that this nation is ready to risk all in order to guarantee the second car and the fifty-five-milean-hour speed limit . It is a thought to make one wonder whether Private Nakamura may not have been on to something after all . ? ? Rehearsal WHEN Mikhail Baryshnikov , the dazzling twenty-six-year-old star of Leningrad 's Kirov Ballet , decided last summer to make his career in the West , the dance world reacted with amazement , anticipation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that one of their leading classical dancers had deserted the company that had trained him . ( In point of fact , Mr. Baryshnikov defected in Toronto from a third-rate Bolshoi touring company to which he had been lent . ) Ballet companies all over the world checked their rosters for possible partners  --  Mr. Baryshnikov stands five feet seven and requires a very small ballerina  --  and began bidding for his services . After several months of negotiations , it was announced that Mr. Baryshnikov would divide his time between several foreign companies and the American Ballet Theatre , in which he would dance a more eclectic repertoire , ranging from classical roles ( " Gistlle , " " La Sylphide " ) , through knockabout comedy ( " Coppelia , " " La Fine Mal Gardee " ) , to contemporary works ( Balanchine 's " Theme and Variadons , " Petit 's " Le Jeune Homme et la Mort " ) . We dropped in at the City Center recently to see how Mr. Baryshnikov was adjusting to America , and found him onstage rehearsing " File , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Balanchine-trained Gelsey Kirkland and Kirov-trained Natalia Makarova . As we took a seat , Mr. Baryshnikov , a delicate-looking young man with tousled blond hair , a pale oval face , deep-set blue eyes , a pointed nose , and a small , determined mouth , was turning Miss Kirkland in a series of rapid pirouettes just inside the footlights on the left side of the stage . He stopped her in an elegant arabesque , clipped slightly to his right , lifted his partner onto his shoulder in a single , fluid movement , and backed slowly toward the center of the stage . Miss Kirkland , a tiny , round-faced girl , who was wearing black tights , a short-sleeved pink blouse , and a white tulle practice skirt , slid to the floor and signailed to the rehearsal pianist to stop . " I 'd like to try that again , please , " she said , with an audible sniffle . Mr. Baryshnikov , who was wearing black tights and a dark-red turtleneck , looked back at the corner where they had been dancing , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , " he said , pantomiming a possible tumble into the wings . Miss Kirkland nodded , and the two dancers tried the step in a different spot . Then , after pausing to catch his breath , Mr. Baryshnikov ran through his solo variations , as A.B.T , dancers materialized in the wings to watch . He whirled around on one font with incredible speed , tossed off a series of linked brisC:s vol6s moving diagonally downstage from left to right , and rose effortlessly toward the roof in two great , backward-turning leaps , bending his left leg in midair and extending it in a perfect arabesque as he landed . ( This combination of steps is a Baryshnikov invention , ) Then he circled the stage in a series of grands jetes that ended with a gravity-defying jump into the wings past the startled pianist . Mr. Baryshnikov reappeared a few minutes later , holding a mug of tea , just as Natalia Makarova , his alternate partner , walked onstage and began to kiss everybody in sight . Miss Makarova , a fragile , blond Kirov @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wore a crisp white tulle skirt over a turquoise leotard and puffed furiously on a cigarette in a long , shiny black JANUARY 2 O. 19 7 5 holder . When the pianist began the first pas de deux , she stepped in front of Mr. Baryshnikov , rose on point , and slowly extended her right leg sidewise , exhaling a cloud of smoke . Mr. Baryshnikov removed the cigarette holder from her mouth and danced a few steps with it clenched between his teeth . Then he stamped out the cigarette , laid the holder on top of the piano , and got clown to business . The rehearsal proceeded smoothly , punctuated by laughter , rapid bursts of Russian , and an occasional scream from Miss Makarova , who yells whenever she makes a mistake . When the rehearsal was over , we went hack to Mr. Baryshnikov 's dressing room and asked , through an interpreter , how many roles he had learned during the past month . " Five , " Mr. Baryshnikov said , counting on his fingers . " La Sylphide , ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Le Jeunc Homme et la Mort . ' Also a new production of Giselle ' and Bayadere ' last summer and Balanchine 's ' Theme and Variations ' in the fall . " " The word has gut around that Mischa learns very quickly , " said our interpreter . Mr. Baryshnikov , who understands more English than he admits , looked embarrassed . " He says he 's fortunate to have received very good schooling , first in Riga and later at the Kirov , " said the interpreter . " In Russia , he was dancing five or six times a month . Here he is dancing four or five times a week . The entire pace of his life has accelerated enormously . " We asked Mr. Baryshnikov how he approached a new role , and he replied that there were two separate problems  --  choreography and characterization . " In nonsensical , comic ballets like Coppelia ' and my character  --  a foolish young boy  --  is quite specific , but there is room to add individual variations , provided you work within the style of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' you ca n't change the steps , but you can make decisions about the character of Albrecht , the hero . " " How about modern ballet ? " we asked . " With Balanchine , you dance the music and Balanchine , " replied Mr. Bary-slanikov . " Not yourself . But to THE NEW YORKER 25 dance one of his works  --  even if you are only a tool of Balanchine  --  is a vet- ) great honor . Roland Petit , who re-choreographed Le Jeune Komme et is Mort ' for me in Paris last month , is primaril ) interested in the interaction of people  --  in the over-all emotional sense that a ballet conveys . As a contemporary dancer , I am always looking for contemporary ballets  --  for example , I would like very much to dance MacMillan 's ' Romeo and Juliet ' and Robbins ' Dances at a Gathering ' ? hut it 's not so much a question of technique as of maturity . There arc many roles that will have to wait until I have the emotional depth to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first big part at the Kirov , " said the interpreter . " What was it ? " we asked . " Adam , in ' Creation of the World , ' re-plied Mi . Baryshnikov , with a smile . " One must begin somewhere  --  de ? " Cox at Cambridge WE recently nipped over to Lon- don , dodged through King 's Cross Station ( where bombers have n't feared to tread ) , and entrained for Cambridge to keep a midafternoon appointment with Archibald Cox , the Harvard law professor and former Watergate Special Prosecutor , who is spending the current academic year as a visiting Fellow of Sidney Sussex College . As we learned from a little background reading during the train journey , Sidney Sussex has never been among the largest or wealthiest of the Cambridge colleges ; nor , as we later observed , is it one of the showiest . It was founded in I596 with a bequest of five thousand pounds from Lad ) Frances Skim- ) , Coun Less of Sussex , and is secluded behind a high wall running along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cars , trucks , and whizzing his ) des . Behind the wall are peaceful courts , stately trees , large gardens , and architecturally ' sensible buildings that make it , as the founder instructed , " a goodly and godly monument for the maintenance of learning . " Presenting ourself at the porter 's lodge at the arranged time , we were immediately escorted by a gray-haired retainer to a rose Krick building in Cloister Court and thence up a flight of stone steps to a door marked with a wooden plaque reading " Professor A. Cox . " " Come in . Come in , " a voice said , answering the retainer 's gentle knock , and Professor A. Cox warmh welcomed us to his rather Spartan quarters . " If I had ton books and pictures here , the room would 1()4 ) 1 ? a bit less spare . I did bring some of nil ' hooks , hut , glory , the cost is just prohibitive . I 'm afraid I do n't have much to offer in the way of hospitality except the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , motioning to us to sit in one of the room 's two more or bass easy chairs . " I did have the good luck to find a bottle of bourbon yesterday , if that would be of interest " Having declined the spirits , with gratitude , we asked Mr. Cox how he happened to be teaching in England . " Well , I would n't be here at all if f had better manners , " he said , chuckling  --  he chuckles and smiles a great deal , probably because he is very relaxed and self-possessed  --  and he distributed himself in the other easy chair , putting his feet up on a Formica-topped coffee table . Six feet three , lean , and fit-looking , his graying hair cropped very short , he was wearing the international professorial gear  --  a tweed jacket and gray flannel slacks  --  along with an American insignia in the form of a pink shirt with a button-down collar . He speaks with a distinctly Cambridge ( Mass. ) accent and with great verve , emphasizing words through sudden and arresting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I accepted the invitation to come here  --  I think the full title of the chair I occupy is Pitt Professor of American History and Institutions ; Henry Commager , both the Rostows , and other friends of mine laid held it  --  long before Watergate . Back in ' 69 or ' 70 . If I 'd had proper manners , I 'd have written the people here in the summer of ' 73 that there was virtually no chance I 'd be able to take the post . But I 'm a procrastinator , and then , too , I would read Evans and Novak , and begin to think maybe I would be available . At any rate , happily , I never wrote . " We asked if the Pitt Professor always resides at Sidney Sussex . " The chair is passed around . I had invitations from three colleges , and I understand there was a fourth , but it never reached me . I chose Sidney partly because it is small , partly because the Master here is Vice-Chancellor of the University , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The last sentence went something like ' It may not be wholly irrelevant to remind you , in view of your recent activitics ' ? remember , this was last winter ? that Oliver Cromwell was a student at Sidney Sussex . ' That tickled me , and made up my mind . If you have no real basis for choice , you might as well choose the man who makes you laugh . " His regular work at the university , Mr. Cox continued , consists of lecturing twice a week on American Constitutional law . " The course is designed for LL.B. candidates , who have already got their bachelor-of-arts degree , but it also attracts undergraduates , including several Americans , and quite a number of older men , who obviously ca n't he students at the University but are very faithful in their attendance . It 's fun but hard to work out lectures directed at such a varied . audience . Of course , this method of teaching is different from the one used in American law schools . At home , we do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So this is really a new experience . I find 1 have to write the lectures down , and that takes a great deal of tune , because writing is a very slow process for me . Then , too , people have been after me a good deal to talk , so I 've been kept quite busy , though I 've certainly not kept the kind of pace one kept at Watergate . In fact , I go home and have tea with my wife many days , and du a little reading and writing afterward . I 'm reading Trollope  --  the Palliser novels  --  and keep interrupting my wife to read her paragraphs that particularly strike me . We have a nice flat on Chaucer Road  --  very quiet and pleasant . It 's a little over a mile from here . I bicycle back and forth , which is the way to get around in Cambridge . The bicycling is another thing that 's new . MY legs are n't in had shape , because I 've always done a lot of walking . Even during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did fifteen miles or so on the Appalachian Trail . On weekends here , there 's nothing I like better than to bicycle down the towpath as far as I can , or out into the little villages . Come to think of it , I guess I have n't done much work on weekends . Oh , yes , I 'm afraid I 'm adapting to the life . You know , people are awfully late in England . Glory ! At home , we always get up at six-thirty . Here , we do n't get up until seven-thirty , and still there 's very little traffic on the streets when I come down to the college . Oh , we 've become very slipshod . I 've even talked about taking Thursday afternoons off , but I do n't know whether I will , I keep telling myself that I wo n't . Glory ! Well , at least I still get up and work a regular week . " Mr. Cox 's study ( his quarters also include a bedroom , and he shares a bath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't look as if it belonged to a man who has given himself over wholly to a life of idleness . Notebooks and tablets , their pages covered with careful handwriting in ink , were spread over the desk , cabinets , and coffee table . Most of that writing , he said , had to do with lectures he had agreed to give at Oxford ; Trinity College , Dublin ; and the Universities of Edinburgh , Keele , Wales , and Southampton . " I 've planned those trips so there will be a couple of free days on either side of the performance to allow a little sightseeing . At Oxford , I will be giving the Chichele Lectures a series of four  --  which will all he on aspects of American Constitutional law , but at the other universities I will be talking a good deal about Watergate . Of course , that 's mainly what people want me to talk about , and I do n't mind . I do n't know any secrets anymore , so there are no problems of that kind . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple of evenings , taking questions afterward , and I find that the English know quite a lot about Water gate . Of course , there are a lot of misunderstandings , too . I suppose the most common is the one that goes : American public life has always been corrupt . What 's new about lVatergate ? As a matter of fact , when you arrived I was addressing myself to that very question in the lecture For Trinity College , Min . " " How do you handle that one ? " " For one thing , I express the personal opinion that , for all the rather cynical acceptance of a degree of corruption in the big municipalities and in some county courthouses , I do n't think corruption is characteristic of public life in America . I really do n't , if you take the country as a whole . Second , I explain that the scale and the systematization of Watergate we re vastly different from anything we 'd seen . No Pnlific ; an ever would have supposed that he could put the bite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of course , we know  --  but a lot of people here do n't realize  --  that the men responsible for Watergate were not politicians . I explain that the real politicians  --  Sam Ervin and others  --  were on the other side of the fence . The Haldemans , the Ehrlichmans , the Mitehells were strangers in politics . President Nixon , too , in many ways . The Watergate crew  --  advertising men , corporate managers , corporation lawyers  --  went into politics with little understanding of the process and mne of the trust in people which are really the factors in making a democratic political system work . Furthermore , I point nut that while we may have become sort of cynically acquiescent , we always hung on to our right to throw the rascals out , either by the electoral process or by investigation and criminal prosecution . And Watergate was an attempt to pervert both of those , which made it wholly different . I go on from there to discuss the Constitutional crisis , but I will spare you the whole speech . " Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fireplace . " We 're in a very cold wing of the college , " he said , resuming his relaxed position . " About this time of day , you know it . The most enjoyable part of these lectures about Watergate is the questions that are asked afterward , though I must say it 's very rare now to get a new one . They go over ground that 's become very familiar to Americans . If I 'm in the mood , I answer questions about my personal involvement by telling a story that might be tided ' The Last Ten Days of Archibald Cox , ' but mostly the answers are in general terms . " We asked Mr. Cox how he has kept up with Watergate developments since leaving Washington . " Like most people , by reading the newspapers , " he said . " At home , the New York Times , Over here , the London Times , the Herald Tribum , and Time or Newsweek . I have , naturally , followed it all with great interest , but I have n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detail as it came out in the newspapers and read every word of the extracts . I was the most frustrated man on earth , I 'm sure , on the day the Supreme Court tapes case was argued last summer . I wanted very ? much to go down and hear the oral argument . After all , it had been my case to begin with , and , having been Solicitor General for more than four years , I always sort of figured that the Supreme Court was my area . Happily , it dawned on me that it would n't do at all for me to be there . The people handling the case would have thought I was sort of looking over their shoulder , and the press might have misunderstood my being there . I think I was quite genuinely just curious , but it seemed prudent to throttle my curiosity . " " Were you fairly certain of the outcomd " " Nu , I could n't feel quite that sure . A lot of people did . When I was Special Prosecutor , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Supreme Court , it 's ten to one we 'll win . ' And I would say , ' You 're crazy . Do n't he talking that way .

It could n't have been otherwise . Of course , it really would have been dis-
