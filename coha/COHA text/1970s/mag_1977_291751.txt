One of the most protracted and politically sensitive diplomatic disputes in American history is rapidly reaching a turning point . U.S. and Panamanian negotiators in Washington hope to initial the draft of the first major agreements on the Canal Zone since the U.S. extracted jurisdiction over the area in a treaty forced upon the fledgling Republic of Panama in 1903 . Very soon , perhaps within the next two weeks , a new deal can be struck-if one final , formidable obstacle can be overcome . That issue is how much money the U.S. should pay Panama before relinquishing the last remnants of control over the canal by the end of the century . <P> Negotiators have already hammered out not one but two treaties . The main document totally erases the old treaty under which the U.S. could exercise authority " as if sovereign " -a contentious phrase that provided for colonial power over the zone . Instead , Panama would gain full jurisdiction over the zone within three years . Meanwhile , the U.S. would operate the canal itself until Dec. 31 , 1999-and then turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Panama Canal Co. , which is entirely owned by the U.S. Government , would lose such perks as subsidized housing and bargain shopping at official stores ; they would simply live as foreigners subject to Panamanian laws and customs as soon as Panama began governing the zone in 1980 or 1981 . <P> It is on the topics of defense and " neutrality " of the zone that American negotiators have scored their most notable breakthrough . Despite cries of Panamanian radicals for a total American pullout , the treaty calls for a gradual military reduction . The number of U.S. troops , now 9,000 , presumably would decline and the 14 U.S. military bases would be reduced to four or five by the year 2000 . At that time , the U.S. would have to pull out the last of its troops-or negotiate yet another treaty . <P> Quiet Urging . The second agreement provides for defending the permanent neutrality of the canal-that is , some U.S. military guarantee that the Big Ditch will be open to ships from any nation . A number of the Latin American governments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Panama have quietly urged the U.S. to insist on this guarantee . Otherwise , ask representatives from such heavy canal users as Ecuador , Colombia , Chile and Peru , how could they be certain that some future Panamanian ruler might not shut off the canal to their ships in a totally unforeseeable squabble ? Largely because of this agreement , General George Brown , Chairman . of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , says he is " satisfied " with the negotiations so far and supports rapid conclusion of both treaties . <P> <P> But the two top American negotiators-voluble , persuasive Lawyer Sol Linowitz , 63 , former Ambassador to the Organization of American States , and icy-calm Ellsworth Bunker , at 83 a veteran of crises from the Dominican Republic to Viet Nam-admit they are temporarily stymied on the question of money .
