At his boss 's suggestion , Roberts offered his invention to Sears . Executives told him that his wrench probably would not sell well and that patents were pending for similar tools . But Sears eventually bought the rights to Roberts ' wrench for $10,000 . <P> A year later , Roberts discovered his invention prominently displayed in a Sears catalog . As it turned out , while trying to discourage him about the value of the tool , the company had test-marketed it and converted about 75% of its wrenches to his design . Sears went on to sell 26 million of the wrenches for a profit of about $44 million . Roberts sued . In December 1976 a federal jury decided that Sears had obtained Roberts ' patent fraudulently . The jury awarded him $1 million . Last week , after Sears had fought the decision all the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 33-year-old grocer in Red Bank , Tenn. , collected his money . What will he do with it ? " I 'll do some more tinkering , " he says . " I think I have some more good ideas . "
