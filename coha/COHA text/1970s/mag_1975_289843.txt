Grand plans for reorganizing the ailing railroads of the U.S. Northeast sometimes seem to come along more regularly than the trains that run on them . But the one that emerged from Washington last week could well become a reality . Drafted by the U.S. Railway Association , a federal agency created last January by the Regional Rail Reorganization Act , it would perform costly and radical surgery on the deteriorating rail system that stretches over 17 states in the Northeast and Midwest . <P> Faster Service . The Railway Association promises that its long-awaited plan would transform what it calls " a transportation disaster unparalleled in the nation 's history " into a self-sufficient system within this decade . Under the plan , a private but federally backed company called Consolidated Rail Corp . ( Conrail ) would carry out the largest corporate reorganization in history : it would take over and consolidate the operations of the bankrupt Penn Central and six other troubled roads . Conrail would lop off about 30% of the combined roads ' rail network , unless affected states could come up with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than $9.3 billion in federal and private funds in a 15-year rehabilitation program . The Railway Association 's chairman , Arthur D. Lewis , a former president of Eastern Airlines and one of the organizers of AMTRAK , says that the Conrail system could be paying its own way in less than three years . <P> The Railway Association also proposed 16 new or improved passenger routes between Northeastern and Midwestern cities . Between New York and Washington , for example , all freight traffic would be removed from the main Penn Central line to track now owned by other companies in order to make way for speedier , more frequent passenger service . New trains would make the 224-mile run in 2 hr. - 30 min. faster than the present Metroliners . The alternative to its plan , says the association , is nationalization of the seven roads that Conrail would run . <P> Resistance to the Conrail plan , on which Congress will be asked to act this summer , is already building in the states that would be affected . New York 's Governor Hugh Carey said last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the routes that would be abandoned . The prospects are for a long , politically charged struggle over Conrail and , while it continues , more infusions of the taxpayers ' money into the sick Northeastern railroads . In the same day that the Railway Association presented its proposal , the Senate voted emergency financial aid for the Penn Central and other roads for the third time since 1970 . The package : $347 million in grants and loan guarantees .
