McDermott wins the big ones <P> There is still money to be made in the stock market-by accident , anyway . <P> The 28,345 stockholders of Babcock &; Wilcox , a big but ho-hum company that makes boilers and piping , have seen the value of their shares jump 69% since January , though profits are down from 1976 Two cash-rich companies , United Technologies Corp . of Hartford and J. Ray McDermott &; Co. , Inc. of New Orleans , have been bidding for B &; W shares as feverishly as well-heeled Texas art fanciers at a Sotheby 's auction . The bidding started at $42 per share offered by United in March , and spiraled up until last week United was offering $58.50 and McDermott $62.50 . At that point , United Chairman Harry Gray , a shrewd takeover dealer , decided " it was n't in the interest of our shareholders to pay any higher fare for the bus ride . " His pullout left the little-known McDermott ( it makes offshore drilling rigs ) the winner of the takeover battle of the year . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suitors but came to believe that it was better for the company to merge with McDermott , a somewhat smaller firm , than to be swallowed by United . McDermott* was able to bid high because its enormously profitable offshore drilling operations gave it $533 million in cash at the end of 1976 . In the heat of the struggle , professional arbitragers - speculators who like to gamble on takeovers-picked up an estimated quarter of B &; W 's shares . To persuade them to sell to McDermott rather than United , B &; W arranged a tasty lagniappe : a special dividend of $2.50 per share on top of the regular 37 dividend , which will be passed back to present B &W; stockholders by McDermott in October . ( Harry Gray refused to do that . ) That brought McDermott 's effective offer to $65 per share . <P> McDermott is paying about 15 times earnings for Babcock &; Wilcox shares , a valuation usually accorded only to such blue chips as Coca-Cola or IBM . B &; W 's spotty earnings record suggests that it is not worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sales have leaped 170% , to $1.7 billion , but earnings have gone up only 60% , to $53 million . <P> Why was McDermott willing to go so high ? Chairman Charles Graves , 61 , is not talking . But Wall Streeters speculate that Graves was practically forced into diversification by his own successful management . Cashing in on the worldwide boom in offshore oil drilling , the company in the past ten years has pushed revenues from $199 million to $1.2 billion , and profits from $25 million to $192 million . With half a billion in cash , McDermott began looking like a tempting takeover target itself ; even United 's Harry Gray cast an eye its way . What Graves wanted was a willing partner in a compatible business . Investors are not so sure that the marriage with B &W; will work . After the victory announcement McDermott 's stock dropped by $3 per share , to $49 . <P> <P> *The company was founded in 1946 by R. Thomas McDermott , now dead , and named after his father .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
