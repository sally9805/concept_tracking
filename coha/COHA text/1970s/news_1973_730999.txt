txt " In three years Saudt Arabia may have greater financial reserves than the United States , Western Europe , and Japan combined . " The speaker , a high U.S. official , was underlining the pivotal role played by King Faisal 's desert realm in the monetary and energy future of the Western world . " In 1974 , " he said , " Saudi Arabia may earn $15 billion in oil revenues , of which the Saudis can spend only $3 billion on internal development . " At that rate , the official went on , the Saudis by the end of this decade " may have accumulated $100 billion in reserves , " becoming in a real sense the " bankers of the world . " Expansion capabilities Saudi Arabia 's supremely important role springs from the fact that only King Faisal 's kingdom , among oil-producing nations , can expand production sufficiently to meet the world 's burgeoning demand for crude . For months Washington and other allied capitals have urged King Faisal to boost his country 's daily production from the current 8.2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ King has signaled his reluctance to expand production , unless the United States cuts back its diplomatic and military support of Israel . Never , however , has the Monarch spelled out his demands . Then , with the King 's warning hanging in the air , the latest Arab-Israeli war broke out , subjecting King Faisal to heightened pressure from other Arab leaders to withhold Saudi oil from the United States . Flow disrupted Already , the renewed fighting has begun to disrupt the flow of Arab oil to the West . Lebanon has closed its southern port of Sidon , which normally receives nearly 500,000 barrels of crude daily by pipeline from Saudi Arabia . The bulk of Saudi production , which moves by tanker from the Persian Gulf , is flowing normally . About 56 percent of Saudi oil goes to Europe , 29 percent to Asia , 6 percent to South America , 6 percent to North America , and a little more than 3 percent to Africa . Potentially ominous is a call by Kuwait for Arab oil ministers to will/elle in emergeiiey seed1on to discuss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use oil in the battle " against Israel . No time was set for the meeting . Currently most Arab oil ministers are in Vienna , where the six Persian Gulf members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries ( OPEC ) are demanding higher royalty and tax payments from Western oil firms . // *Saudis : ' bankers of world ' // In Washington , meanwhile , President Nixon launched a campaign to enlist the support of American citizens to reduce " anticipated energy demand by 5 percent over the next year . " The White House urged Americans to lower their home thermostats by 4 percent this winter , thereby saving " over 400,000 barrels of oil per day or enough to heat 2 million homes . " The President ordered federal agencies to lower their winter temperature settings to 70-72 degrees , to eliminate unnecessary lighting , and to buy and rent " more energy efficient vehicles " ? in short , smaller cars . Adopting Charles Schulz 's character " Snoopy " as the symbol of a " SavEnergy " campaign , the White House pledged to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including teaching kits for use in school classrooms . Lack of awareness President Nixon appeared to be unaware of the real market situation , when ? to the astonishment of his experts ? he recently warned the Arabs that " oil without a market does n't do a country much good " Asked privately why the President had so warned the Arabs , a high-ranking U.S. official snapped : " Because he was advised by a fool . " The President , the official added , had been " readvised . " With each industrial nation scrambling to secure enough oil , declared a U.S. official , no agreement has yet been reached among the United States , Japan , and European countries on how to share oil , in case the Arabs reduce supplies .
