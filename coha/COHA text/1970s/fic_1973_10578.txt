" I do , too , " said Jenny , " although she meant no harm , she never does mean any harm , she is just too nosy and moves about  --  " He stood in front of me now . " Why did you go there today ? " I had already come near a truth I could n't name , so close to it , so convinced that something was being pushed up from the bottom of me , that I began to tremble with an anxiety I had never felt before . It had nothing to do with my fear of the policeman or of my family . " Answer me , young lady . Why did you go there today ? " My voice was high and came , I thought , from somebody else . " I do n't know . I read about Mr. Arneggio last night . Love , I think , but I 'm not sure . " A long time later somebody , I do n't remember who , repeated the word love , and I heard Jenny 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so busy gripping my knees that I could n't , did n't , want to look up , or to hear , and did n't care what they said . Somewhere , during that time , I found out that pieces of Arneggio had been discovered a few hours before in the backyard of the store , and I heard the man say to my aunts , " O.K. I 'll tell Mr. Emile . But if you should hear anything about Bethe Bowman it is your duty , the Mafia and all , dangerous , and keep the kid away from there . " Hannah it was who poked inc to my feet and said to the man , " Thank you . You are most courteous . " 40BetheI do n't think we spoke on the streetcar going home but I do n't know because I think of it now as the closestI have ever come to a conscious semiconsciousness , as if I were coming through an anesthetic , not back into a world of reality , but into a new body and time , moving toward something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I am sure my aunts believed that I was frightened of police consequences or my father 's anger . I was glad they thought that and nothing more . Later that night Jenny said that since Emile had not phoned she saw no sense in ever telling my father or mother if I would promise to stay away from Bethe . The next day and for days after that there were discussionsof the murder of Arneggio . Bethe 's name was mentioned in every press story but she was never called Bowman . In the boardinghouse so many ques-t ions were asked , opinions exchanged , that Jenny grew very sharp and took to defending Bethe , perhaps out of family pride , perhaps from the tangles of her own nature , so sure , so dismissive of " the ninnies of this world , " and so sympathetic to them . I " rom the time I was fourteen until I was twentylive , I had no news of Bethe , although I often thought of her . I thought of her as I got dressed for my wedding , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choosing an old ugly gray chiffon . As it went over my head , I heard myself say her mime , and I saw again the man , Arneggio , in the restaurant . Then I do n't believe I ever thought of her41Pentimentoagain through a pleasant marriage that was not to last , until the first afternoon I slept with Dashiell Hammett . As I moved toward the bed I said , " I 'd like to tell you about my cousin , a woman called Bethe . " Hammett said , " You can tell me if you have to , but I ca n't say I would have chosen this time . " Later that same year I went to New York from Hollywood to tell my parents about my divorce , and then , on my way back to California , I went to New Orleans to tell my aunts . It was an unpleasant errand : my parents and my aunts liked my husband , knew that I liked him , and had every right to be puzzled and disturbedabout me . I suppose , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my aunts and I talked a good deal about past times , and it was on that visit , as I opened a closet door to get a bath towel , that I saw once again the canvas valise that had been given me and then taken back . As my aunts moved about the kitchen I stood staring at it , wondering about me and them . I wrapped a towel around me and went to stand in the kitchen door . I said , " Is the letter still there from Bethe ? The one that says she now has good Italian friend and that maybe if they marry you will come again to see her ? " Hannah turned her back to me . Jenny said , " What does all that old stuff mean now ? " " It means that long before the day at the police station you knew about Bettie and Arpeggio. pint you did n't tell me you knew . " Bethe " That 's right , " said Jenny . " Why do n't you put on a bathrobe ? " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them back , because that night I said , " I know that you will not approve of my living with a man I am not married to , but that 's the way it 's going to be . " " How do you know that , " said Jenny , " how do you know the difference between fear and approve ? " " Because you deserted , sorry , you gave Bethe up , when she loved a way you did n't like . When she was in trouble , neither of you , or Papa , went to help her . " An hour later , reading on my bed , I heard through the walls of the small shoddy house an argument betweenmy aunts . There was nothing remarkable about that  --  Jenny 's temper was as bad as my father 's and mine  --  but something was different , and as I opened my door I realized that it was Hannah who was angry . Neither I nor anybody else , I think , had ever heard Hannah angry , and so I walked into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said to me , " Your generation , camp and collegeand all those fine places , goes about naked all the time ? " " Yes , " I said , " all the time . And we sleep with everybody and drink and dope all night and do n't have your fine feelings . Maybe that 's the reason we do n't always spit on people because they live with lowdownWops and get in trouble . Each generation has its standards . " Jenny laughed , but Hannah rose , turned over her chair and said , " Sit down " 43PentimentoJenny said to her , " We do n't have to prove our-selves . " " Why do n't you go out in the garden ? " Hannah asked Jenny , and as I whistled in surprise at the tone , she turned into her bedroom . I could see she was unlockinga box . Something large had happened between them . I went to get dressed and stalled to give them time . When I came out , Jenny said to Hannah , " O.K. Go ahead . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and said , " Look at the date on that page . " The date was ten years before , in the first days of September . There was a thousand-dollar withdrawal from a total of thirty-three hundred . I said I did n't understand . Jenny said , " Hannah does n't want you to think mean of her ever because she loves you more than sense . I , myself , do n't give much of a damn what you think . But so be it . That thousand dollars was withdrawn about a week after the police station visit and was used to get Bethe out of trouble . Your father did n't know , nobody knew , and you 're to shut up about it . " " You are fine ladies , " I said after a while , " the best . " Jenny was angry . " Sure , sure , now put all that sweet-time patter in the shit can . " " My ! " said Hannah . Jenny said , " Bethe paid it back . A long time ago , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her44Betheand when the police finally left her alone , so do n't start any stuff about you giving us the money because we are poor virgin ladies . " " I have n't got any money , " I said , " but maybe someday . " " Then someday send us a steak . " " I will , " I said . ( The morning after The Children 's Hour opened , four years later , I gave a porter on the Southern Pacific ten dollars to carry a package of twelve steaks to my aunts and got back a telegram saying , " Do we have to eat the porter as well ? " ) The next morning Hannah , who usually left for work at seven-thirty , was still in the dining room at eight-thirty , and as I ate the wonderful breakfast that brought back my childhood  --  tripe , biscuits , cold crabs , crawfish , bitter coffee  --  she said that she was entitled to a day 's holiday when I came to visit . An hour later , Jenny appeared and said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I think I guessed where we were going , but I know so little about directions , and the city was so changed and grown , that I did n't bother to ask what direction we traveled in . When we reached the end of the trolley line , we began a long , long walk through flat , ugly , treeless land . Occasionally we would pass a small house , and once an old man came from a dilapidated outhouse to look at us . My aunts were tall , heavy women who never walked more than a few blocks , and now I heard Jenny 's heavy breathing and became nervous when I saw Hannah take her hand . Near the45Pentimentoend of the road , sitting alone on the plain , was a mean cottage , square against the sun . The halffinishedporch had four tilted steps and a broken chair as if to show that somebody had once intended to use it but had grown weary of the effort . Bethe was standing on the steps , her body slanted with their angle , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the steps to support Jenny with one arm , Hannah with the other . I followed them into the house . I do n't think many words were spoken that afternoon , and certainly I said none of them . We drank a bitter , black iced tea , we stayed about an hour , we made the long trek home with sighs from Jenny as Hannah hummed something or other off key . That night I telephoned Dash to say I would stay in New Orleans a few days longer , would return to Los Angeleson the weekend . The next morning I went back to Bethe 's , losing my way on the turn of the dirt road , then finding it again . As I came toward her house , I turned and ran from it , around another dirt path and then off into another , coming suddenly into a green place , swampy , with heavy stump trees and large elephant ears . I heard things jump in the swamp and I remember thinking I must be sick without feeling sick , feverish without fever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but a path brought me in sight of a roof and as I ran toward it , thinking that I must leave the sun and ask for water , I saw Bethe hanging clothes from a line that stretched froin46Bethea pole to an outhouse . She was naked and I stopped to admire the proportions of the figure : the large hips , the great breasts , the tumbled auburn hair that came from the beautiful side of my father 's family and , so I thought that day , had been lost in America . She must have heard the sound of the wet , ugly soil beneath me , because she turned , put her hands over her breasts , then moved them down to cover her vagina , then took them away to move the hair from her face . I said , " It was you who did it . I would not have found it without you . Now what good is it , tell me that ? " She took a towel from the line , came toward me , and wiped my face . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house , she pushed me gently into a chair . After a while she came back into the room , covered now by a cheap sack of a dress , carrying coffee . I must have fallen asleep in the chair because I came awake saying something , losing it , then trying to remember what I had wanted to say . I took a sip of the coffee , finished the cup and , for the first time in my grown Iife , I vomited . Then I must have gone back to sleep ( because when I looked down the floor was clean and Ilethe was in the kitchen . I went to stand near her as she dropped heavy-looking dough balls into a boiling broth . She asked me , half in German , half in English , how I was feeling . I tried to say I had never felt sick and , trying too hard , said , " I was n't sick . Just the opposite . It was that day in the restaurant , you and Arneg-47Pentimentogio  --  " and never finished , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand over my mouth . When she took it away she said , " Now I go in bed maybe seven or eight P.M. , in the night . He is plumber and like dinner when come home soon at four-thirty in afternoon . Come for visit again . " I waited for a dumpling to be finished , ate it , did n't like it , shook hands with Bethe , and walked down the road . Not far from the larger dirt road that would join the road of the streetcar back to New Orleans , I passed a very thin middle-aged man , carrying a lunch pail . Maybe he was n't the plumber , but I think he was . I was never to find out . Two years later my aunts wrote that Bethe died of pneumonia and they had only known about it because they had a note from a T. R. Carter . They said things like poor Bethe and they wished they had been able to help her , but they were getting old and the streetcar ride was hard for them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what they thought was her birthday . My aunts said they had written to Germany , had no reply , did n't know if any of Bethe 's family were still alive , but maybe the next time I went to Germany I would try to find out and bring the news . I never went back to Germany because now it was the time of Hitler , and I do n't even remember talking again about Bethe with my aunts , although one drunken night I did try to tel Hammett about Bethe , and got angry when he said he did n't understand what48BetheI meant when I kept repeating that Bethe had had a lot to do with him and me . I got so angry that I left the apartment , drove to Montauk on a snowy day , and came back two days later with the grippe. 49WILLyH E was married to my ridiculous great-aunt . But I was sixteen or seventeen by the time I knew she was ridiculous , having before then thought her most elegant . Her jewelry , the dresses from Mr. Worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her Dubonnet with a few drops of spirits of ammonia , were all fine stuff to me . But most of all , I was impressed with her silences and the fineness of her bones . My first memory of Aunt Lily  --  I was named for her ; born Pansy , she had changed it early because , she told me , " Pansy was a tacky old darky name " is of watching one of the many fine lavallieres swing between the small bumps of her breasts . How , I asked myself in those early years of worship , did my mother 's family ever turn out anything so " French , " 53Pentimentoso raffinee ? It was true that her family were all thin people , and all good-looking , but Lily was a wispy , romantic specimen unlike her brothers and sisters , who were high-spirited and laughed too much over their own vigor and fancy money deals . That is what I thought about Aunt Lily until I made the turn and the turn was as sharp as only the young can make when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only then that I understood about the Dubonnet and recognized that the lavallieres were too elaborate for the ugly dryness of the breasts , and thought the silences coma-like and stupid . But that , at least , was not the truth . Lily was so much younger than her brothers and sisters , one of whom was my grandmother , that I do n't think she was more than ten years older than my mother . It was whispered that her mother had given birth to her at sixty , and in my bewitched period that made her Biblical and in my turn-against period made her malformed . I do not know her age or mine when I first met her , because she and her husband , Willy , their son and daughter , had been living in Mobile , and had only then , at the time of my meeting them , moved back to New Orleans . I think I was about nine or ten and I know they lived in a large house on St. Charles Avenuefilled with things I thought beautiful and foreign , only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were ornate copies of French and Italian miseries , cluttering all the tables and running along the stair-54Willycase walls and newel posts on up to the attic quarters of Caroline Ducky . Whenever we visited Aunt Lily I was sent off to Caroline Ducky with a gift of chocolate-covered cherriesor a jar of pickles , because Caroline Ducky was part of my mother 's childhood . Anyway , I liked her . She was an old , very black lady who had been born into slavery in my mother 's family and , to my angry eyes , did n't seem to want to leave it . She occupied only part of the large attic and did what was called " the fine sewing , " which meant that she embroidered initials on handkerchiefs and towels and Uncle Willy'sshirts and was the only servant in the house allowed to put an iron to Aunt Lily 's clothes . Caroline Ducky never came downstairs : her meals were brought to her by her daughter , Flo Ducky . WhateverI learned about that house , in the end , came mostly from Caroline Ducky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nurse Sophronia was her niece and Sophronia had vouched for me at an early age . But then her own daughter , Flo Ducky , was retarded and was only allowed to deal with the heavy kitchen pans . There were many other servants in that house , ten , perhaps , but I remember only Caroline Ducky and a wheat-colored chauffeur called Peters . Peters was a fine figure in gray uniform , very unlike my grandmother 's chauffeur , who was a mean-spirited slob of a German mechanic without any uniform . My grandmother and the other sister , Hattie , would often discuss Peters in a way that was clear to me only55Pentimentomany years later , but even my innocent mother would often stop talking when Peters came into the room with Aunt Lily 's Dubonnet or to suggest a cooling drive to Lake Pontchartrain . Aunt Lily 's daughter died so early after they returned to New Orleans that I do not even remember what she looked like . It was said officially that she died of consumption , supposedly caused by her insistence on sleeping on the lawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was always the rumor of syphilis . In any case , after her daughter 's death , Aunt Lily never again appeared in a " color "  --  all her clothes , for the rest of her life , were white , black , gray and purple and , I believed in the early days , another testament to her world of sensibility and the heart . The son was called Honey and to this day I do not know any other name for him . ( He died about fifteen years ago in a loony bin in Mobile and there 's nobody left to ask his real name . ) Honey looked like his mother , thin-boned , yellowish , and always sat at dinnerbetween Lily and his father , Uncle Willy , to " interpret " for them . I suppose I first remember Willy at the dinner table , perhaps a year after they had moved to New Orleans , although because he was a legend I had heard about him all my life . For years I thought he was a legend only to my family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a famous character to the rest of the city , to the state , and in certain foreign parts . De-56Willypending , of course , on their own lives and natures , people admired him , envied him , or were frightened of him : in my mother 's family his position in a giant corporation , his demotions , his reinstatements , his borrowings , his gamblings , were , as Jake , my grandmother'sbrother , said , " a sign of a nation more interested in charm than in stability , the road to the end . " By which my grandmother 's brother meant that Willy had gone beyond their middle-class gains made by cheating Negroes on cotton crops . But , in fairness to her family , I was later to discover that Willy had from time to time borrowed a large part of Lily 's fortune , made money with it , lost it , returned it , borrowed it again , paid interest on it , and finally , by the time I met him , been refused it altogether . I do not think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no longer spoke to one another , but that 's what Honey 's " interpretations " seemed to be about . Uncle Willy , his pug , good-looking , jolly face , drawn by nature to contrast with my aunt 's sour delicacy , would say to Honey such things as , " Ask your mother if I may borrow the car , deprive her of Peters for a few hours , to go to the station . I will be away for two weeks , at the Boston office . " Honey would repeat the message word for word to his mother on the other side of him and , always after a long silence , Aunt Lily would shrug and say , " Tell your father he does not need to ask for his car . His money bought it . I would have been happier with something more modest . " There were many " interpretations " about trips or57Pentimentocars , but the day of that particular one , Willy looked down at his plate for a long time and then , looking up , laughed at my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . " You are the charming flower under the feet of the family bulls . " Then , puzzling to a child , his laughter changed to anger and he rose , threw his napkin in Honey 's face and said , " Tell your mother to buy herselfanother more modest car . Tell her to buy it with a little piece of the high interest she charged me for the loan she made . " We stayed for a longer time than usual that day , although Lily did n't speak again , but on the way home my mother stopped in the nearest church , an old habit when she was disturbed , any church of any belief , and I waited outside , impatient , more than that , the way I always was . Aunt Jenny , my father 's sister , who ran a boardinghouse , would take me each Saturday to the French market for the weekly food supplies . It was our customto have lunch in the Quarter at Tujague 's , and my watered wine and her unwatered wine always made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after Willy had told my mother she was a charming flower , I said to Jenny , " Everybody likes Mama , do n't they ? " " Almost , " she said , " but not you . You 're jealous of your mama and you ought to get over that before it 's too late . " " Mama nags , " I said . " Papa understands . " " Ach . You and your papa . Yes , she does nag . But she does n't know it and is a nice lady . I said you must know your mother before it is too late . " 58WillyShe was right . By the time I knew how much I loved my mother and understood that her eccentricities were nothing more than that and could no more be controlledthan the blinking of an eye in a high wind , it was , indeed , too late . But I did n't like lectures even from Jenny . " Uncle Willy likes Mama , " I said . " I think that 's hard for Aunt Lily . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Hard for your Aunt Lily ? " " You do n't like her because she 's thin , " I said to Jenny , who was six feet tall , and heavy , and had long been telling me that my rib bones showed . " I think she 's the most interesting , the only interesting , part of our family . " " Thank you , " said Jenny . " Your mother 's family . Not mine . " " I did n't mean you or Hannah , " I said , " really , I ... " " Do n't worry , " Jenny said as she rose , " about me , worry about yourself and why you like very thin people who have money . " I asked her what she meant , and she said that somedayshe would tell me if I did n't find out for myself . ( I did find out , and when I told her she laughed and said I was thirty years old , but better late than never . ) It was that year , the year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my memory , the year before my sharp turn , that I saw most of Aunt Lily . I went to59Pentimentothe house two or three times a week and whatever she was doing , and she was never doing much , she would put aside to give me hot chocolate , sending Honey to another room as if she and I were ready to exchange the pains of women . I usually went in the late afternoons , after school , but sometimes I was invited to Saturday lunch . The visits were hung in a limbo of fog over water , but I put that down to the way people who had greater culture and sensibility than the rest of us lived their special lives . I do n't know what I meant by culture : in Aunt Lily 's house there were no books other than a set of Prescott , and once when Jenny and I went to our second-balcony seats for a concert of Verdi 's Requiem Aunt Lily sent for us to join her in her box . After a while , Jenny said to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ please not to hum the Wedding March ? It does n't go well with the Libera me ' and there are other reasons she should forget it . " But I put that down to Jenny 's customarysharpness and went on with my interest in Aunt Lily . Ever since her daughter 's death Aunt Lily made soft sounds from time to time and talked even less than before , although unconnected phrases like " lost life , " " the hopes of youth , " " inevitable waste , " would come at intervals . I was never sure whether she was talking of her daughter or of herself , but I did know that , for a woman who had never before used her hands , she now often touched my hair , patted my arm , or held Honey firmly by the hand. 60WillyAnd I thought it was the need to deny the death of her child that made possible the scene I once saw when I arrived for a visit while Lily was out shopping . The car came into the driveway to the side door and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's hand . As she stepped from the car , she twisted and slipped . Peters caught her and carried her to the door . On the way there , her head moved down to kiss his hair . I did not know how to cross the room away from the window , how to face what I had seen , so I ran up to the third floor to call upon Caroline Ducky . Past the second landing I heard Honey 's voice behind me . He said , " He does it to her . " " Does what ? " " You 're older than me , " he said , and ran up ahead of me . He was larger , taller than I , and his face was now sweaty and vacant . I said , " What 's the matter ? " " Ssh and I 'll show it to you . " I went by him and was caught by the arm . " Want to see it ? " " See what ? " " My thingy . " I had n't seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my no came too slow , because my shoulderswere held with his one hand , my dress lifted with the other , and I felt something knocking against my stomach . " Open up , " he shouted into his future . " Open up . " I sneezed so hard that he fell back against the stair-61Pentimentocase wall . I was subject to sneezing fits and now I stood in the full force of one violent rack after another . When the sneezing was over , Honey had disappearedand Caroline Ducky was standing a few steps above me . I do n't know how long she had been there but I followed her to the attic , was told to press my upper lip and given a Coca-Cola spiced heavily with spirits of ammonia , an old and perhaps dangerous New Orleans remedy for anything you did n't understand . Caroline Ducky looked up from her sewing . " You be careful of that Honey . " ( She was to be right : at twenty he raped a girl at a picnic , at twenty-two or - three he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later years in the Mobile loony bin were in some way connected with an attack on a woman who was fishing in the Dog River . ) Caroline Ducky said , " I knew what he was going to be the day it took him three days to get himself out . " " Out of what ? " " Out of the stomach of his mother . " " What did you know ? " " I knew what I knew . " I laughed with an old irritation . Such answers were , perhaps still are , a Southern Negro form of put-down to the questions of white people . " His mama did n't want him , his papa did n't want him , and a child nobody wants got nothing ahead bu t seeping sand . " " Then what did they have hire for ? They do n't like each other . " 62Willy " She trapped him , " said Caroline Ducky . " Mr. Willy , he was drunk . " " Things ca n't start from birth , that early , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ai n't early , the day you push out , that 's late . " " What did you mean Aunt Lily trapped him ? How can a man be trapped ? " " You too young for the question , I too old for the answer . " She was pleased with herself and laughed . " Then what did you start it for ? You all do that . It 's rotten mean . " Grown people were always on the edge of telling you something valuable and then withdrawing it , a form of bully-teasing . ( Little of what they withdrew had any value , but the pain of learning that can be unpleasant . ) And I was a particular victim of this empty mystery game because , early and late , an attempt was made to hide from me the contempt of my mother 's family for my father 's lack of success , and thus there was a kind of patronizing pity for me and my future . I think I sensed that mystery when I was very young and to protect what little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not to leave me until I myself made money : I rebelled against my mother 's family , and thus all people who were rich , but I was frightened and impressed by them ; and the more frightened and impressed I grew the more aimlessbecame my anger , which sometimes expressed itself in talk about the rights of Negroes and on two Sundays took the form of deliberately breaking plates63Pentimentoat my grandmother 's table . By fourteen my heart was with the poor except on the days when it was with those who ground them under . I remember that period as a hell of self-dislike , but I do not now mean to make fun of it : not too many years later , although old shriveled leaves remain on the stump to this day , I understood that I lived under an economic system of increasing impurity and injustice for which I , and all those like me , pay with ridiculous wounds to the spirit .

I left the house and went far out of my way to back-of-town , the Negro section , to put a dime in the poor box of the Baptist Church . I did this whenever I had an extra dime and years before , when my nurse Sophronia had proudly told my father about it , he said to me , " Why do n't you give it to the Synagogue ? Maybe we never told you that 's where you belong .

It was said that he had married her for money and respectability , but after six or seven years he could n't have needed either because by that time he was vicepresidentof the company , living with the first fast cars , a hundred-foot yacht , the St. Charles Avenue great house , an apartment at the old Waldorf in New York , a hunting place on Jekyll Island , an open and generous hand with everybody , including , I think , my father in his bad years .

At one dinner the talk was of " outbreaks , " arranged by " native troublemakers " two men who worked for my uncle 's company had been murdered  --  and the need for firm action , revenge . The firm action was taken by Mr. Christmas , who strung up twenty-two men of a Guatemalan village , cut out their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others into the jungle . Uncle Willy did not join in the pleasure of that tale , but he said nothing to stop it , nor to interfere with a plan to send a boatloadof guns to Christmas to " insure the future . " The terrors and exploitations of this company were to become a world scandal , the first use of the U.S. Marines as private mercenaries to protect American capital . But even in my uncle 's time , the scandal was of such proportions that the guns and the killings tapered off enough to convince me that the company had grown " liberal " as it established schools , decent houses and hospitals for the natives . When , in 1969 , I told that to a graduate student from Costa Rica , he laughed and said he thought I should come and see for myself . In any case , my reaction to those dinner tales at Aunt Lily 's was an unpleasant mixture : my distaste for what I heard did not stop my laughter , when they laughed , at the shrewdness and heroics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natives . I believed in Willy 's personal affection and generosity toward theO6Willypoor people he exploited . But the values of grown people had long pounded at my head , torn me apart with their contradictions . But I could not now , in truth , get straight the tangledmess of that conflict which went so many years past my childhood : I know only that there were changes and that one day I felt that Aunt Lily was silly and that I had been a fool for ever thinking anything else . But I went on being sympathetic and admiringof Uncle Willy , interested in the days of his youth when he had ridden mules through Central and South American jungles , speaking always with an almostbrotherly admiration of the natives from whom he " bought " the land . I am sure that his adventures made him interesting , the money he earned from them was different to me than money earned from a bank or a store , that his fall from high position seemed to me a protest , which it was n't . And I had other feelings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for years after the time of which I speak . But I already thought Aunt Lily foolish stuff the day of the outbreak . We had arrived in New Orleans only a few hours before she telephoned to ask my mother to come immediately . My mother said she was tired from the long journey , but that evidently did n't suit Aunt Lily because my mother told Jenny she guessed she 'd have to go immediately , something bad must have happened . Jenny sniffed and said the something bad that had happened was probably the latenessof the Paris mails that failed to bring Aunt Lily's67Pentimentonewest necklace . My mother said it was her duty to go and I said I would go along with her . Since I did n't often volunteer to go anywhere with my mother , she was pleased , and we set off at my mother 's slow pace . Lily was pacing around her upstairs sitting room , her eyes blank and unfocused , and , annoyed with seeing me , she said immediately that it was too bad my hair was so straight and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent for my hot chocolate and her watered Dubonnet , and my mother nervously chatted about our New York relatives until I went to a corner with a copy of Snappy Stories . I guess Lily forgot about me because she said to my mother , " You 've heard about Willy . " My mother said no , she had n't heard about Willy , what was the matter , and Aunt Lily said , " I do n't believe you . Jenny Hellman must have told you . " I do n't think anybody in her life had ever before told my mother they did n't believe her , and I was amazed at the firmness with which she said that Jenny had told her nothing , Jenny did n't move in large circles , worked too hard , and she , my mother , always tried not to lie before God . " God , " said Aunt Lily . " God ? He has n't kept everybody else in town from lying at me . Me and Honey and my brothers and sisters who warned me early against Willy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's in the open , now that he says he 's paid me back when , of course , he still owes me sixty thousand , " and she began to cry. 68WillyI saw my mother 's face , the pity , the getting ready , and knew that she was going to walk into , be a part of , one of those messes the innocent so often walk into , make worse , and are victimized by . I left the room . I met Peters in the hall . When he spoke to me , I realized he had never spoken to me before . " Miss Lily with your mama ? Miss Lily upsetting herself ? " " I guess so , " and started up the stairs toward CarolineDucky . " Miss Caroline Ducky do n't feel good , " he said . " I would n't bother her today . " I went past him . When Caroline Ducky answered my knock and we had kissed , I said , " Sorry you do n't feel good . Your rheumatism ? " " One thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old . Sit you down and tell me what you reading . " This was an old habit between us . She liked stories and I would sum up for her a book I had read , makingthe plot more simple , cutting down the number of people , and always , as the story went on , she forgot it came from a book , thought it came from life , and would approve or disapprove . But I did n't want to fool around that day . " What 's Aunt Lily so upset about ? She made Mama come right away . Something about Uncle Willy and the whole town knowing . " Caroline Ducky said , " The whole town do n't know and do n't care . Has to do with that Cajun girl , up Bayou ' l'eche. " 69PentimentoI was half crazy with pleasure , as I always was with this kind of stuff , but I had ruined it so many times before by going fast with questions that now I shut up . Caroline Ducky , after a while , handed me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by her small window , leaning out to look at the street . In the last few years she had done this a good deal and I figured it had to do with age and never going into the street except for a funeral , and never liking a city where she had been made to live . She said , over her shoulder , " I 'm making a plan to die in high grass . All this Frenchy stuff in this town . Last night , I ask for greens and pot likker . That shit nigger at the stove send me up gumbo , Frenchy stuff . Tell your ma to cook me up some greens and bring ' em here . Your ma used to be a beauty on a wild horse . A wild Alabama horse . " I suppose there was something wrong with my face because she said , " Your ma 's changed . City no good for country folk , your ma and me . " " What 's that mean ? " " Your ma 's a beauty inside out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my mother and I did n't want to talk about her that day , but I think Caroline Ducky meant that my mother was a country girl and the only comfortable period of her life had been with the Alabama Negroes of her childhood . New Orleans and New York , a worldly husband , a difficult child , unloving sisters and a mother of formidable coldness had made deep marks on my70Willymother by the time I was old enough to understand her eccentric nature . I said , " Uncle Willy going to marry a Cajun girl ? " " What ? What ? There ai n't a white child born to woman ai n't crazy , " said Caroline Ducky . " Niggers sit around wasting time talk about white folk being pig-shit mean . Not me . All I ever say , they crazy . Lock up all white folk , give ' em to eat , but lock ' em up . Then all the trouble be over . What you talking about , marry Cajun girl ? " " All I meant was it must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being in love . I guess nobody wants to share their husband . My father is n't faithful to my mother . " " How you know that ? " " I found out years ago at a circus when . . . " " Shut up , " said Caroline Ducky , " this house pushing me to my grave . " There were sudden sounds from downstairs , as if somebody was calling . I opened Caroline Ducky 's door but nobody seemed to be calling me , so I closed it again and went back to the embroidery hoop hoping to please Caroline Ducky into more talk , but the sounds downstairs grew louder and Caroline Ducky was too busy listening to pay any attention to anything ( might ask . She laughed . " Well , well . Time now for Miss Lily 's morphine shot . " This was the richest hour I had ever spent and I was willing to try anything. 71Pentimento " Look , Caroline Ducky , I 'll take you back to Demopolis . I 'll get the money from Papa or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll take you back , I swear . " " Shut the shit , " said Caroline Ducky , good and mad . " Take me home ! What I going to do when I get there ? Nobody there for me except the rest of your shit catfish family . Home . What home I got ? " The door opened and Uncle Willy came in . " What 's going on ? " he said to Caroline Ducky . " She 's calling in the securities , " said Caroline Ducky , in a new kind of English , almost without an accent . " Taking ' em from the bank . " " Christ , " said Uncle Willy . " When ? " " Today 's Sunday , tomorrow 's Monday . " " God in Heaven , " said Uncle Willy . " What a bastard she is , without telling me . That gives me sixteenhours to borrow three hundred thousand dollars . Maybe Peters just told you that to scare me . " Caroline Ducky smiled . " You too smart for what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonderful in my life and , although I did n't know what they were talking about , I knew I would , it was just around the corner . I suppose I was straining with the movements of body and face that have worried so many people in the years after that , because Uncle Willy realized I was in the room . He smiled at me . " Hello , Lillian . Would you lend me three hundred thousand dollars for a month ? " I said , " You het. if I had it , I 'd . . . " 72WillyHe bowed . " Thank you . Then maybe somebody else will . If they do , I 'll take you fishing . " Several years before , Willy had taken my father and me and one of the big-faced men called Hatchey on his large boat and we had had a fine two days fishing in the Gulf . My pleasure in the boat had pleased Willy and there had always been talk of another trip after that . Now he left the room , patting my head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the window . I went downstairs . I heard my mother say to somebody that things would be better now that the doctor had arrived . Walking back to my Aunt Jenny 's boardinghouse , I said , " So she is having her morphine . Gets it often , I guess . My mother stared at me . " What makes you think anything like that ? " " Caroline Ducky . Plenty makes me think plenty . Like what about all that money she 's making Uncle Willy pay back because of his Cajun girl ? " " My goodness , " my mother whispered . " Please do n't speak that way . Please . " And I knew I had gold if I could get the coins together . But it was no use because my mother was moving her lips in prayer and that meant she had left the world for a while . For the next few days I tried games on Jenny , hintingat the morphine , deliberately mispronouncing it , giving her pieces of the conversation between Uncle Willy and Caroline Ducky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had outside women like the Cajun girl and what did she think , but I got nowhere . Jenny said we should mind our own business because rich people like my ma 's family often got into muddlesnot meant for the rest of us . It was a difficult time for me . I wandered about the house at night and Mrs. Caronne , Aunt Jenny 's oldest boarder , complained ; I wrote two poems about the pleasures of autumn love ; I skipped school and spent the days sitting in front of St. Louis Cathedral and one night I wandered back-of-town and got chased home by a cop . I was , of course , at an age of half understanding the people of my world , but I was sure , as are most young people , that there were simple answers and the world , or my own limitations , were depriving me of a mathematical solution . I began , for the first time in my life , to sulk and remain silent , no longer having any faith in what I would say if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear from anybody else . The notebooks of those days are filled with questionmarks : the large , funny , sad questions of the very young . The troubles of Aunt Lily were not spoken about and my mother , as far as I know , did not return to the house . But I did , every few days , circling it , standing down the street , seeing nothing , not even Honey . But after two weeks that was unbearable and so I decided to take some pickles to Caroline Ducky . As I turned in the back entrance , Uncle Willy came out the side entrance to load his car with fishing rods and a shot-74Willygun . He looked fine and easy in old tweed clothes and good boots . When he saw me he said , " I 'm going fishing and maybe a bird or two . " " Oh , " I said , " I wish I were going . I do . I do . " " I 'd like to have you , " he said . It 's been too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the river road , but it was a long way and I was happier  --  exalted was the word I used when I thought about it afterward  --  than I had ever been before . It was as if I had changed my life and was proud of myself for the courage of the change . The wilder the country grew , the more we bumped along on the oyster shell roads , the wilder grew my fantasies : I was a rebel leader going to Africa to arouse my defeated tribe ; I was a nun on my way to a leper colony ; and when a copperhead crossed the road I was one of those crazy lady dancers who wound snakes around their bodies and seduced all men . Willy and I did not speak for a very long time , not one sentence , and then he said , " Oh , Lord , what about your mama , a toothbrush , all that stuff ? " There are many ways of falling in love and one seldom is more interesting or valid than another unless , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it becomessomething else , like your arm or leg about which you neither judge nor protest . I was not ever to fall in love very often , but certainly this was the first time and I would like to think that I learned from it . But the mixture of ecstasy as it clashed with criticism75Pentimentoof myself and the man was to be repeated all my life , and the only thing that made the feeling for Uncle Willy different was the pain of that first recognition : not of love , but of the struggles caused by love ; the blindness of a young girl trying to make simple sexual desire into something more complex , more poetic , more unreachable . Somewhere , after that silent time , we stopped at a small store where Uncle Willy seemed to know the old lady who was sitting on the porch . He telephoned my mother from a back room and came out to say that all was O.K. He bought me a toothbrush and a comb , a pair of boots , heavy socks , a heavy woolen shirt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty-four that made me cry . The bayou country has changed now , and if I had n't seen it again a few months ago I would have forgotten what it looked like , which is the measure of the strangeness of that day because I remember best what things look like and forget what it has been like to be with them . But even now I could walk the route that Willy took that day so long ago as we left the car and began to move north , sometimes on a rough path , more often through undergrowth of strange and tangledroots . Swamp oak , cypress , sent out roots above ground and small plants and fern pushed against the wild high dark green leaves of a plant I had never seen before . There was constant movement along the ground and I was sweating with fear of snakes . ( ) nee76WillyUncle Willy , ahead of me , called out and waved me away . I saw that the swamp had come in suddenly and that he was deep in the mush , pulling himself up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tree . He was telling me to move to my left but I did n't understand what he meant until I sank into the mud , my feet , my ankles going in as if underground giants were pulling at them . I liked it , it was soft and comfortable , and I leaned down to watch the things moving around me : crawfish , flat small things the shape of salamanders , then the brownness of something the size of my hand with a tail twice as long . I do n't know how long I stood there , but I know Willy had called to me several times before I saw him . Above me now he had tied a branch to his pants belt and was throwing it a foot from me . It could not have been easy for him to pull me out as he stood on uncertain ground with my dead weight at the other end . I watched the power of the shoulders and the arms with the sleepy admiration of a woman in love . I think he was puzzled by my slowness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept asking me if something had happened and said he had been a fool to try a shortcut to the house . I do n't know where I thought we were going , or if I thought about it at all , but the house was the meanest f had ever seen and , over the next two days , more crowded with people . There was a room with three beds , and two others of Spanish moss on the floor , a kitchen of ells and wandering corners , dirty with77Pentimentocoal smoke , filled with half-broken chairs and odd forgotten things against the walls . Willy was as gay as my father had always said he was , embracing people who came and went , throwing a small child in the air , and cooing at a baby who lay in an old box . He was at home here , this man who was accustomed to the most immaculate of houses , the imitated **25;307;TOOLONG of Aunt Lily 's house . The dirt and mess pleased him and so did the people . I could not sort them out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the men to the women , what child belonged to whom , but they were all noisy with pleasure at Willy 's arrival , and bowls of hot water were brought from the stove and an old woman and a young woman cleaned his boots and washed his feet . A young girl of about my age took my shoes to dry on the stove and gave me a bowl and a dirty rag to wash with . I must have drawn back from the rag  --  obsessive cleanliness now seems to me less embarrassing than it seemed that day , New Orleans being a dirty city when I was young , with open sewers and epidemics  --  because Willy said something in Cajun French and the rag was taken out of my hand . It was a good night , the best I had ever had up to then . The dinner was wonderful : jambalaya , raccoon stew , and wild duck with bitter pickles , all hot with red pepper that made the barrel-wine necessary after each bite . The talk was loud and everybody spoke together except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country and my school French needed ad-78Willyjustment to the omitted sounds and dropped syllables . My pleasure in food and wine was , of course , my pleasure in Willy as he chased wine with whiskey , wolfed the food , and boomed and laughed and was amused , and pleased with me . I remember that a very tall man came into the room , a man in city clothes , and that my uncle left with him to sit on the porch , and everybody else disappeared . But after that I do n't remember much because I was drunk and woke up in the bedroom that smelled of other people and saw two women on beds and one on the floor . I have never known whether I heard that night or the next night three quarrelsome voices outside the house , and my uncle 's voice saying , " If it goes wrong , and the last one did , I 'll get the blame . Nobody else . And that will be curtains . " A man kept saying , " You got no choice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too sleepy to think about it . Certainly by the time Willy shook me awake at dawn he was in a fine humor , laughing down in my face , saying I must never tell my mother he had got me drunk and to get ready now for the ducks . I have been duck shooting many times since that early morning , but I have never liked it again because it never again had to do with the pleasure of crouching near Willy in the duck blind . I was then , was always to be , a bad shot and once Willy was angry with me because I ruined the flight overhead , but later he did so well and the dogs made such fine recoveries that we came back with fourteen ducks by nine o'clock . The79Pentimentohouse was empty and Willy made us giant sandwiches of many meats and peppers and said we were going to the store . We walked around to where we had left the car and drove down the bayou road to a settlement of twenty or thirty houses and a store that seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bolts of cloth , guns , sausages , cheeses and ropes of red peppers , fur hats , oars , fish traps and dried fish . I was standing on the porch when I heard Willy say to somebody inside , " Wait a minute , please . I 'm on the phone . Certainly you can see that . " Then a young man passed me carrying to our car a case of liquor , three or four giant bolts of cloth , a box of ladies ' shoes with fancy buckles , a carton of coffee beans and a sewing machine . Inside , Willy said , " Hatchey , Hatchey ? Ask them to hold off . No , it 's not too late . Send a cable to the boat . " ( I do n't know if I knew then the name Hatchey belonged to the man I had met on Willy 's boat , and who had been outside on the porch the night before , or if I recognized it a long time later when my father told my mother about the troubles . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The owner of the store called out about a check for last month 's stuff and now all this , but Willy waved him away and said his office would send it . The owner said that would be fine , he just hoped Mr. Willy understood he needed the money , and the car drove off without me . A few minutes later it made a circle in the road and came back to the store . W i l l y opened80Willythe door for me and said , " Forgive me , kid . It 's not a good day . " When we reached the house , Willy got out of the car and strode off . I did n't see him again until supper and then , as people thanked him for the gifts , he was bad-tempered and drank a lot . There had been plans for treeing raccoons that night , but Willy would n't go and would n't let me go . He and I sat on the porch for a long time while he drank whiskey and one of the old ladies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had forgotten I was there because suddenly he began to whistle , a short call , then a long call . A young woman came down a side path as if she had been waiting there . She sat on the porch steps , at his feet . The second time he touched her hair I made a sound I had never heard myself make before , but neither of them noticed . A long time later , he threw an empty whiskey bottle into space , got up from his chair , toppled it as the girl rose to help him . She moved in back of him , put both arms under his , and they moved down the road . I followed them , not caringthat I could almost certainly be heard as the oyster shell path crunched under me . They did n't go very far . There was another house , hidden by the trees , and then I knew I had seen the girl several times before ; a big , handsome , heavy girl with fine dark hair . I went back to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could not describe with any truth because81PentimentoI believe that what I felt that night was what I was to feel about myself and other people years later : the humiliation of vanity , the irrational feeling of rejection from a man who , of course , paid me no mind , and had no reason to do so . It is possible to feel many conflicts and not know they are conflicts when you are young : I was at one minute less than nothing and , at another , powerful enough to revenge myself with the murder of Willy . My head and body seemed not to belong together , unable to carry the burden of me . Then , as later , I revenged myself on myself : when the sun came up I left the porch , no longer fearingthe swamps . On the way down the road I , who many years later was to get sick at the sight of one in a zoo , stumbled on a snake and did n't care . A few hours after that , a truck gave me a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wrong direction . I did not see Willy again for five years , and if he worried about my disappearance that night , I was never to hear about it . One July day , three or four years later , on a beach , my father said to my mother , " What 's the verdict on Willy ? " He was asking what my mother 's family was saying . She said , " I 'm sorry for him . " " Yes , " said my father , " I am sure you are , but that 's not what I 'm asking . " " What can they do , " she said , as she always did when my father attacked her family . " It is n't their fault that he lost everything . " 82Willy " Have they forbidden you to see him ? " " Now , now , " said my mother . " So they have forbidden you . " " I 'll see him as my conscience dictates , " said my mother , " forbid or not , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough , grown by now , to say , " What happened ? " My father said , " He sent down a shipload of guns with Hatchey Moore intended for Christmas to use . They stopped the ship . There was a scandal . " " Guns to put down the natives ? " " Yes . " " You forgive that ? " I asked . " It 's always been a disgrace , " said my father who , to the end of his life , was a kind of left liberal who had admiration for the capitalist victors . " But it was n't all Willy himself . He was just acting for the company . He happened to get caught . So they fired him . That old shooting-up stuff is n't liked by the new boys . Too raw . So Willy took the rap . " " And you feel sorry for him ? " " Yes , I do , " said my father , " he 's stone dead broke . He was good to me . " I said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Oh , my ! " said my mother . " We 're all weak vessels . " During those years , because I had started to go to college , we went less often to New Orleans , three or four times , perhaps , for a month . On each visit , my mother went to see Aunt Lily , but I never again went83Pentimentoin the front door of the house . I would go to the kitchen entrance to call on Caroline Ducky , the last time a few months before she died . She looked fine , that hot June day , more vigorous than ever . We spoke of Uncle Willy . She took for granted that I knew what everybody else knew : he had been thrown out of " the big company , " had started his own fruit import companyand was , according to New Orleans gossip , havinga hard time . Somehow , somewhere , my aunt 's money was again involved , but that made no sense to me because I could n't see why she gave it or why he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a young eighteen and so little of what older people did made any sense to me that I had stopped worrying about it , finding it easier and more rewarding to understand people in books . On one of the visits to Caroline Ducky , she said , " You ever see your Uncle Willy ? " " No . " " Me neither , much . He come around this house maybe once a month , pick up something , sleep in his office . " " Or with the Cajun girl . " " What Cajun girl ? The part nigger Cajun girl ? " " I do n't know , " I said . " It does n't make any difference to me if she 's part nigger . " " Well , " said Caroline Ducky 's loud voice , " it makes a difference to me , you little white Yankee know-nothing . " I had already come ha If distance up the slippery84Willymountain dangers of liberalism . " I think maybe it 's the only solution in the end . Whites and blacks . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my head . The old lady had remarkable strength , because when she saw the basket had missed me she rose and pulled me from the chair . " Get you down and pick up the mess you made . " As I was crawling around for needles and spools , fitting thimbles back into the pretty old box , she said , " That a nice box . Your mama gave it to me . I leave it to you when I go to die . " " I do n't want it . I do n't like people to throw things at me . " " You got a hard road to go , " she said . " Part what you born from is good , part a mess of shit . Like your Aunt Lily . She made the shit and now she sit in it and poke around . " I was old enough to know what passed for wisdom among ladies : " I guess she 's not had an easy time , Aunt Lily . Uncle Willy wanting her money , and his girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Many people is full a shit . " With the years CarolineDucky said shit more often than anybody I ever - net except the head carpenter at the old Lyceum Theatrein Rochester , New York . " Willy 's got his side , " said the old lady . " Where and why you think the morphine come here ? " I was so excited that I dropped the thread I was rewindingand tried not to shout . " The morphine the doctor gives Aunt Lily for her headaches ? " 85Pentimento " He do n't give her no morphine ' cause she do n't have no headaches . Getting bad now , she wo n't last long . " And Caroline Ducky giggled . ( She was wrong . Aunt Lily lived another twenty-three years . ) I guess Caroline Ducky was savoring Aunt Lily 's death because she kept giggling for a while . Then she said , " That Peters ai n't all nigger . His grandpa had a Wop store on Rampart Street . Wops know about stuff like that . " " Stuff like what ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wearing me out . And Wops make good fancy men . Peters been with your Aunt Lily long time now , but Mona Simpson down the road had him before that . " Over thirty years later , when Toys in the Attic had been produced and published , I had a letter from Honey . I guess he was out of the Mobile loony bin , at least for a while , because the letter had a San Diego postmark . He wanted to know if I ever came San Diego way , were my aunts still living and did I ever visit New Orleans ; he himself never went there anymorealthough he still owned the St. Charles Avenue house , and , by the way , had I meant Mrs. Prine in my play to be his mother and her fancy man to be Peters ? If I had , he did n't mind a bit , he 'd just like to know . I had not realized until Honey 's letter that the seeds of Mrs. Prine had , indeed , flown from Aunt Lily 's famous gardenias @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wise to deny even that to anybody as nutty as Honey . I showed my denial to Hammett , who86Willytalked me out of mailing it , saying that the less I had to do with Honey the better . And that was because years before the letter , and years after that last time I ever saw Caroline Ducky , Aunt Lily and Honey , on her yearly New York buyingsprees for jewelry and clothes and furniture , came twice to visit us on the farm in Pleasantville . I do n't know why I invited them , some old hangover of curiosity , I guess , wanting to fill in missing parts of myself . The first visit was O.K. , although Honey seemed even more odd than I remembered and there was some mention of his nervous troubles . After they left , the cook reported that she had seen him kick our largest poodle and put a half-eaten piece of chocolate cake in his pocket . A few years later Aunt Lily and Honey drove out with my father on a Sunday morning . Honey and I went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teased a bad-tempered pony who kicked him . At lunch the conversation was disjointed . My aunt , as usual , ate almost nothing , but Honey went four times to the buffet table . My father said , " You have a good capacity , Honey . The fish is pretty good , but how can you eat that other junk ? " " That other junk , " I said , " is sauerbraten . I cooked it for the first time , to please you . It 's German and I thought you 'd like it . " " It ca n't he German , " said my father , " it 's Jewish. 87PentimentoI do n't know where you learned to make bad Jewish food . " When Dash laughed I was about to say something about loyalty , but was interrupted by Aunt Lily , who said to Honey , " Go vomit , dear . " Honey said , " I do n't want to . " Aunt Lily sighed . Then she turned to my father . " You still see my husband , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Willy , but I do n't get home much anymore , and Willy does n't come to New York . " " Oh , yes , he does , " said Aunt Lily , " he comes all the time . He just does n't want to see you anymore . He has no loyalty to anybody . " My father 's face was angry . " He does n't come North and you know it , because he does n't have any money . None . " " That 's right , " said Honey through a mouthful of something . " Mama took it all . It 's for me , she says , but she gives a lot to Peters . " Aunt Lily seemed to be dozing , so Honey said it again . When he got no answer he said it the third time and added , " That 's because of fucking . " My father laughed . " Remember , Honey , my daughteris in the room . " Then he said to Dash , " Some nuts . " And he got up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Dash said to me , " Your father who hates the stuff has now eaten four pieces of it . " " You have to try everything to know you do n't like it , " said my father. 88WillyAunt Lily turned to Honey . " I do n't like your talk . Shut your face . " My father said to Aunt Lily , " Never punish a child for telling the truth . Have n't I lived by that , Lillian ? " " And by much else , " I said . My father turned to Dash . " Lillian 's got the dispositionof her mother 's family . My family were goodnatured . Look what 's happening to Honey . " Honey had gone out into the hallway and was standing on his head . Aunt Lily said , " It 's his way of adjustinghis stomach . The doctor told me Willy has syphilis . " " Oh , Christ , " my father said to me , " any time your mother 's family get stuck with anything , crazy children , bad stocks and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said to Aunt Lily , " I do n't believe you . Uncle Willy is a fine man . I admire him very much . " Dash said , " Watch it , you 're not going to like what you 're saying . " Soon after lunch , Aunt Lily said she wanted " a liedown , " was there a room to rest in . I took her upstairs , Dash went to his room , my father and I sat reading , and once in a while I watched from the window to see that Honey was doing nothing more than dozing on the lawn . Toward four o'clock their car arrived and I went to tell Aunt Lily . There was no answer to my knocks , but when I opened the door Aunt Lily was not asleep : she was sitting in a chair , 89Pentimentostaring out the window at the top of a tree . I spoke to her several times , moved in front of her , leaned over her . There was no sign of recognition , no answer . I went to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Before I spoke he said , " She gets like that . " " What 's the matter with her ? " " Peters takes care of it , not me . I 'll send him back tomorrow . " " Where are you going ? " " To New York . I got a date . " I said to the chauffeur , " Wait here , please . This gentleman ca n't pay for the car without his mother , " and went off to find Hammett . He put down his book and went with me to the room where Aunt Lily was sitting . He pulled a chair up next to her . " You 're a very handsome man , " she said . " Handsomepeople have an easier time in this vale of tears . " " Your car is waiting , " he said . " I hope you are good to my niece . Are you good to . . . " and faltered over my name . " Better than she deserves , " said Dash . " Please get up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In our South , " she said , " it is a mark of woman 's trust when she allows the use of her first name . Call me Lily . " " No , " he said , " one is enough , " and reaching down for her arms he brought her to her feet . But he had not correctly gauged her humor , because she pulled sharply away from him , moved to the bareau , and held tight to its sides. 90WillyI think she saw me for the first time . She said , " What are you doing here ? You like Willy . You 're no good . " " We 'll talk about that another day , " Dash said and moved quickly to take away the alligator pocketbook that had been her reason for the move to the bureau . " Give me my bag immediately , " she said , " there 's a great deal of jewelry in that bag . " Dash laughed . " More than jewelry . Come along . " I followed them down the stairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the driveway to the car . Once she stumbled and , as he caught her , she threw off his arm and moved away with the overdignifiedmotions of a drunk . As Dash shut the door of the car , I heard Honey laugh and he waved to me as they drove past the porch . " Well , " said Dash , " that will be enough of them , I hope . " " What was that about her pocketbook ? " " She wanted a fix . I do n't know what kind and do n't want to . A bad pair . Why do n't you leave them alone ? " " What did you mean when I said Uncle Willy was a fine man and you said I was n't going to like what I was saying ? " " You told me that even as a child you hated what his company was doing , the murders , and what it meant to you . " " 1 never told you Willy did the murders . He 's a91Pentimentogood man . He just went where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sure . Now let 's leave that talk for another day or forever . " " Why should we leave it ? You always say that when . . . " " Because I want to leave it , " he said , " maybe in the hope you 'll find out for yourself . " I thought about that for a few days , sulked with it , then left it and forgot about it . A year later Dash and I moved to Hollywood for four or five months , each of us to write a movie . Soon after we got there , we had one of our many partings : Hammett was drinking heavily , dangerously . I was sick of him and myself and so one weekend I took off to see my aunts in New Orleans . I would not have liked to live with them for very long , but for a few days I always liked their modest , disciplined life in the shabby little house that was all they could afford since each had stopped working . It was nice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cot in the ugly living room , crowded with stuff that poor people ca n't bring themselves to throw away , nice to talk about what we would have for the good dinner to which one of many old ladies would be invited to show off my aunts ' quiet pride in me . Nicest of all was to take a small piece of all the Hollywood money and buy them new winter coats and dresses at Maison Blanche , to be delivered after i left for fear that they 'd make me return then il ' 1 were there , and then to go along to Solari 's , the fine grocers , and lead it92Willytaxi with delicacies they liked and would never buy , hear Jenny protest over the calves ' - foot jelly she liked so much and watch Hannah 's lovely , greedy eyes deny the words she made over the cans of giant Belgian asparagus . The taxi driver and I were piling in the Solari cartonswhen I saw Willy staring at me from across the street . He was much older : the large body hung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heavy face lined and colored sick . I crossed the street and kissed him . He put an arm around me and pressed my head to his shoulder . He said very softly , " So you turned into a writer ? Come and have lunch with me . " He paid the taxi driver to take the stuff to my aunts ' house and we walked a few blocks to Decatur Street and turned into an old building facing the river that had a large sign saying , " Guacosta Fruit Import Company . " As we went up the steps he said , " This is my company , I am rich again . Do you need anything money can buy ? " Directly opposite the stair landing was an enormous room entirely filled by a dining room table . Along the table , at intervals of ten or twelve chairs , were printed signs , " French , " " Mexican , " " German , " " Creole , " " Plain steaks , chops , " and seated at the table , sometimes in groups of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men who looked like , and maybe were , the men I had seen at Willy 's house on the Sundaysso many years before . Willy put his arm aromid ine , " What kind of food , 93Pentimentokid ? There 's a different good chef for each kind . " When I chose Creole , he whispered to the two men who were sitting in that section and they rose and moved down the table . We must have had a lot of wine because our lunch lasted long after everybody left and I did n't get back to my aunts until six that evening , and then I was so rocky that I had a hard time convincing them not to send for a doctor and during the night , through the thin walls , I heard them talking , and twice Hannah came to turn on the light and look down at me . I was in the shower the next morning when there was a knock on the bathroom door and Willy said , " Come along . We 're going to the country . " Going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garden . I called out and Hannah waved , but Jenny turned her back , and Hannah dropped her hand . Toward midday we went through the town of Hammondand Willy said , " In a few minutes . " The long driveway , lined with moss oak , ended at a galleried plantation house . " We 're home , " he said . It was a beautiful , half empty house of oval rooms and delicatecolors . Beyond the great lawns were strawberry fields and , in the distance , ten or twelve horses moved slowly in a field . I said , " I like my farm in Pleasantville . But there 's nothing like the look of Southern land , or there 's no way for me to get over thinking so . It 's home for me still . " " I 'll give you this place , " he said . " I 'd like you to have it . " 9.1WillyLate in the afternoon , after a long walk in the strawberryacres , I said my aunts would be hurt if I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , and then we started back to New Orleans . Willy 's driving was erratic and I realized that he had had a great deal to drink during the day . When we took a swerve I saw that he had been dozing at the wheel . He stopped the car , said he thought I should drive , and he slept all the way to the outskirts of New Orleans . I had n't expected the voice , nor the soberness with which he said , " Pull over for a minute . " We stopped in the flat land that was beginning then to be as ugly as it is now . " When are you going to Los Angeles ? " " Tomorrow morning . " " Do you have to ? " " No . I do n't have to do anything , " believing , as I had done all my life that was true , or believing it for the minute I said it . " I 've been faking . I 'm broke , more than I 've ever been . Stone broke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I guess , and I have n't got the stuff to pay a month 's rent on the office . I owe everybody from here to Memphis to Costa Rica . " " I have some money now , " I said . " Do n't do that , " he said sharply , " do n't say it again . " He got out of the car , walked around it and came to my window . His face was gay and he was grinning now . " I am going to Central America on Frid.cy . I 'll move the way I first went as a boy , on95Pentimentomules . I 'm the best banana buyer in the world . I 'll get all the credit I want when I get there , San Jose , Cartago . Three or four months . I ca n't tell you how I want to go the way I did when I was young . It 's rough country and wonderful . Come with me . You 'll see with me what you could never see without me . A mule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age . . . " He touched my hand . " Anyway it 's time you and I finished what we have already started . Come on . " That night , at dinner , I told my aunts I would not be leaving them until Friday . Hannah was pleased but Jenny said nothing . The next morning when I went into the dining room , Jenny pointed to a large florist box and watched me unwrap a dozen orchid sprays . She said Willy had phoned and left the name of a man who made fine riding boots , he had ordered me two pairs and I was to go down immediately , fit them , and come to his office for lunch . I was uneasy at the expression on Jenny 's face and went to get dressed . When I came back she was sitting in the hall oppositemy door , Hannah standing next to her . She raised her hand and Hannah disappeared . " You 're going riding on a horse ? " " Yes , " I said . " As I remember your riding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm going to Central America for a few months . " Jenny had rheumatism and always moved with difficulty . Now she got out of the chair , holding to a table . When I moved to help her she milled her arm away frorn me. 96Willy " In that case , " she said , " you ca n't stay here . You have been our child , maybe more , but you ca n't stay here . " I said , " Jenny ! Jenny ! " But she pushed passed me and slammed the door of the kitchen . I lay on the bed for a long time but after a while I packed my bags and went to find a taxicab . It was raining a little and they were scarce that day and by the time I reached St. Charles Avenue there was a sudden , frightening curtain of rain , so common in New Orleans . I went into a restaurant and had a drink . I phoned the Beverly Hills house from the restaurant . I said to Hammett , " I 'm in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a while and I did n't want you to worry . " " How are you ? " he said . " O.K. and you ? " " I 'm O.K. I miss you . " " I miss you , too . Is there a lady in my bedroom ? " He laughed . " I do n't think so , but they come and go . Except you . You just go . " " I had good reason , " I said . " Yes , " he said , " you did . " " Anyway , " I said , " I 'll be back in a few months . Take care of yourself and I 'll call you when I come back . Maybe then we wo n't have to talk about reasons and can just have a nice dinner . " " No , " he said , " I do n't think so . I 'm not crazy about women who sleep with murderers . " " I have n't slept with him . And he 's never killed anybody . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just hired people to do it for him . I was in that racket for a lot of years and I do n't like it . " He sighed . " Do what you want . Have a nice time but do n't call me . " I flew to Los Angeles that night . I did n't telephone Dash but somebody must have told him I was there because after about ten days he called me , said he was on the wagon , and we had a nice dinner together . I never saw Willy again and never had an answer to the letter I had mailed from New Orleans . On my birthday that year my aunts sent a handknittedsweater and the usual box of pralines with a note saying all the usual affectionate things and adding , as a postscript , that Willy had gone into bankruptcyand barely avoided jail for reasons they could n't figure out . And not many months after that I had a telephone call from a man I knew who worked on a New Orleans newspaper . He said that Willy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with two men , had had an automobile accidentthat killed everybody in the car , and did I want to comment for the obit . Years later , Caroline Ducky 's grandchild , who had worked for Willy as a cleaning woman , said it had n't been any mystery , that accident , because he had . started out dead drunk from a one-room , cockroach apartment he had rented on Bourbon Street. 98JULIAHAVE here changed most of the names . I do n't know that it matters anymore , but I believe the heavy girl on the train still lives in Cologne and I am not sure that even now the Germans like their premature anti-Nazis . More important , Julia 's mother is still living and so , perhaps , is Julia 's daughter . Almost certainly , the daughter 's father lives in San Francisco . In 1937 , after I had written The Children 's Hour and Days to Come , I had an invitation to attend a theatre festival in Moscow . Whenever in the past I wrote about that journey , I omitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not feel able to write about Julia. 101PentimentoDorothy Parker and her husband , Alan Campbell , were going to Europe that same August , and so we crossed together on the old Normandie , a pleasant trip even though Campbell , and his **27;334;TOOLONG jibes , had always made me uneasy . When we reached Paris I was still undecided about going on to Moscow . I stayed around , happy to meet Gerald and Sara Murphy for the first time , Hemingway , who came up from Spain , and James Lardner , Ring Lardner 's son , who was soon to enlist in the InternationalBrigade and to lose his life in Spain a few months later . I liked the Murphys . I was always to like and be interested in them , but they were not for me what they had been to an older generation . They were , possibly , all that Calvin Tomkins says in his biography : they had style , Gerald had wit , Sara grace and shrewdness , and that summer , soon after they had lost both their sons , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was to see them after that I came to believe they were not as bonny as others thought them , or without troubles with each other , and long before the end  --  the end of my knowing them , I mean , a few years before Gerald died , when they saw very few of their old friends  --  I came to think that too much of their lives had been based on style . Style is mighty pleasant for those who benefit from it , but maybe not always rewarding for those who make and live by its necessarily strict rules . There were many other people ihat summer in102JuliaParis , famous and rich , who invited Dottie for dinners and country lunches and the tennis she did n't play and the pools she did n't swim in . It gave me pleasure then , and forever after , that people courted her . I was amused at her excessive good manners , a kind of put-on , often there to hide contempt and dislike for those who flattered her at the very minute she begged for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manners got so good they got silly , but then the words came funny and sharp to show herself , and me , I think , that nobody could buy her . She was wrong : they could and did buy her for years . But they only bought a limited ticket to her life and in the end she died on her own road . It was a new world for me . I had been courted around New York and Hollywood , as is everybody who has been a success in the theatre and young enough not to have been too much on display . But my invitations were second-class stuff compared to Dottie'sadmirers that month in Paris . I had a fine time , one of the best of my life . But one day , after a heavy night 's drinking , I did n't anymore . I was a child of the Depression , a kind of Puritan Socialist , I guess  --  although to give it a name is to give it a sharper outlinethan it had and I was full of the strong feelingsthe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same strong feelings about something we all thought of as society and the future , but the difference between us was more than generational  --  she was long accustomed to much I did n't want . It103Pentimentowas true that she always turned against the famous and the rich who attracted her , but I never liked them well enough to bother that much . I had several times that month spoken on the phone with my beloved childhood friend Julia , who was studying medicine in Vienna , and so the morning after the heavy drinking I called Julia to say I would come to Vienna the next day en route to Moscow . But that same night , very late , she called back . She said , " I have something important for you to do . Maybe you 'll do it , maybe you ca n't . But please stay in Paris for a few days and a friend will come to see you . If things work as I hope , you 'll decide to go straight to Moscow by way of Berlin and I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said I did n't understand , who was the friend , why Berlin , she said , " I ca n't answer questions . Get a German visa tomorrow . You 'll make your own choice , but do n't talk about it now . " It would not have occurred to me to ignore what Julia told me to do because that 's the way it had always been between us . So I went around the next morning to the German consulate for a visa . The consul said they 'd give me a traveling permit , but would not allow me to stay in Berlin overnight , and the Russian consul said that was n't unusual for people en route to Moscow . I waited for two days and was about to call Julia again on the day of the morning I went down for an early breakfast in the dining room of the Ilotcl Meu-104Juliarice . ( I had been avoiding Dottie and Alan , all invitations , and was troubled and annoyed by two snippy , suspicious notes from Alan about what was I up to , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concierge said the gentleman on the bench was waiting for me . A tall middle-aged man got up from the bench and said , " Madame Hellman ? I come to deliver your tickets and to talk with you about your plans . Miss Julia asked me to call with the travel folders . " We went into the dining room , and when I asked him what he would like he said , in German , " Do you think I can have an egg , hot milk , a roll ? I can not pay for them . " When the waiter moved away , the tall man said , " You must not understand German again . I made a mistake . " I said I did n't understand enough German to worry anybody , but he did n't answer me and took to reading the travel folders until the food came . Then he ate very fast , smiling as he did it , as if he were remembering something pleasant from a long ago past . When he finished , he handed me a note . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Johann . He will tell you . But I tell you , do n't push yourself . If you ca n't you ca n't , no dishonor . Whatever , I will meet you soon . Love , Julia . " Mr. Johann said , " I thank you for fine breakfast . Could we walk now in Tuileries ? " As we entered the gardens he asked me how much I knew about Benjamin Franklin , was I an expert ? I105Pentimentosaid I knew almost nothing . He said he admired Franklin and perhaps someday I could find him a nice photograph of Franklin in America . He sat down suddenly on a bench and mopped his forehead on this cool , damp day . " Have you procured a German visa ? " " A traveling visa . I can not stay overnight . I can only change stations in Berlin for Moscow . " " Would you carry for us fifty thousand dollars ? We think , we do not guarantee , you will be without trouble . You will be taking the money to enable us to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be . We are a small group , valuable workers against Hitler . We are of no common belief or religion . The people who will meet you for the money , if your consent is given , were once small publishers . We are of Catholic , Communist , many beliefs . Julia has said that I must remind you for her that you are afraid of being afraid , and so will do what sometimes you can not do , and that could be dangerous to you and to us . " I took to fiddling with things in my pocketbook , lit a cigarette , fiddled some more . He sat back as if he were very tired , and stretched . After a while I said , " Let 's go and have a drink . " He said , " I repeat . We think all will go well , but much could go wrong . Julia says I must tell you that , but that if we should not hear from you by the time of Warsaw , Julia will use her family with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , , 10oJulia " I know her family . There was a time she did n't believe in them much . " " She said you would note that . And so to tell you that her Uncle John is now governor . He does not like her but did not refuse her money for his career . And that her mother 's last divorce has made her mother dependent on Julia as well . " I laughed at this picture of Julia controlling members of her very rich family . I do n't think we had seen each other more than ten or twelve times since we were eighteen years old and so the years had evidently brought changes I did n't know about . Julia had left college , gone to Oxford , moved on to medical school in Vienna , had become a patient-pupil of Freud 's . We had once , in the last ten years , spent a Christmas holiday together , and one summer , off Massachusetts , we had sailed for a month on her small boat , but in the many letters we had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the bare terms of each other 's life , nothing of the daily stuff that is the real truth , the importance . I knew , for example , that she had become , maybe always was , a Socialist , and lived by it , in a one-room apartment in a slum district of Vienna , sharing her great fortune with whoever needed it . She allowed herself very little , wanted very little . Oddly , gifts to me did not come into the denial : they were many and extravagant . Through the years , whenever she saw anything I might like , it was sent to me : old Wedgwoodpieces , a Toulouse-Lautrec drawing , a **26;363;TOOLONG we saw together in Paris , a set of Balzac that she put in a rare Empire desk , and a wonderful set of Georgian jewelry , I think the last thing she could have had time to buy . I said to the gray man , " Could I think it over for a few hours ? That 's what Julia meant . " He said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he too prepared for matters of this kind . I will be at the station tomorrow morning . If you agree to carry the money , you will say hello to me . If you have decided it is not right for you , pass by me . Do not worry whichever is decided by you . " He held out his hand , bowed , and moved away from me across the gardens . I spent the day in and around Sainte-Chapelle , tried to eat lunch and dinner , could n't , and went back to the hotel to pack only after I was sure Dottie and Alan would have gone to dinner with the Murphys . I left a note for them saying I was leaving early in the morning and would find them again after Moscow . I knew I had spent the whole day in a mess of indecision . Now I lay down , determined that I would not sleep until I had taken stock of myself . But decisions , particularly important ones , have always made me sleepy , perhaps because I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and thinking things out is only what other people tell me I should do . In any case , I slept through the night and rose only in time to hurry for the early morning train . I was not pleased to find Dottie and Alan in the lobby , waiting to take me to the station . My protests108Juliawere so firm and so awkward that Alan , who had a remarkable nose for deception , asked if I had a reason for not wanting them to come with me . When he went to get a taxi , I said to Dottie , " Sorry if I sounded rude . Alan makes me nervous . " She smiled , " Dear Lilly , you 'd be a psychotic if he did n't . " At the railroad station I urged them to leave me when my baggage was carried on , but something had excited Alan : perhaps my nervousness ; certainly not his claim that they had never before known anybody who was en route to Moscow . He was full of bad jokes about what I must not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and all the junk people like Alan say when they want to say something else . I saw the gray man come down the platform . As he came near us Alan said , " Is n't that the man I saw you with in the Tuileries yesterday ? " And as I turned to say something to Alan , God knows what it would have been , the gray man went past me and was moving back into the station . I ran toward him . " Mr. Johann . Please , Mr. Johann . " As he turned , I lost my head and screamed , " Please do n't go away . Please . " He stood still for what seemed like a long time , frowning . Then he moved slowly back toward me , as if he were coming with caution , hesitation . Then I remembered : I said , " I only wanted to say hello . Hello to you , Mr. Johann , hello . " " H el lo , Madame I Eellman. " 109PentimentoAlan had come to stand near us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is Mr. Campbell and Miss Parker there . Mr. Campbell says he saw us yesterday and now he will ask me who you are and say that he did n't know we knew each other so well that you would come all this way to say goodbye to me . " Mr. Johann said , without hesitation , " I wish I could say that was true . But I have come to search for my nephew who is en route to Poland . He is not in his coach , he is late , as is his habit . His name is W. Franz , car 4 , second class , and if I do not find him I would be most grateful if you say to him I came . " He lifted his hat . " I am most glad , Madame Hellman , that we had this chance to say hello . " " Oh , yes , " I said , " indeed . Hello . Hello . " When he was gone , Alan said , " What funny talk . You 're talking like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " sorry not to speak as well as you do in Virginia . " Dottie laughed , I kissed her and jumped for the train . I was nervous and went in the wrong direction . By the time a conductor told me where my compartmentwas , the train had left the station . On the connectingplatform , before I reached my coach , a young man was standing holding a valise and packages . He said , " I am W. Franz , nephew , car 4 , second class . This is a birthday present from Miss Julia . " He handed me a box of candy and a hatbox marked " Madame Pauline . " Then he bowed and moved off . I carried the boxes to my compartment , where//oJuliatwo young women were sitting on the left bench . One girl was small and thin and carried a cane . The other was a big-boned woman of about twenty-eight , in a heavy coat , wrapped tight against this mild day . I smiled at them , they nodded , and I sat down . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there was a note pasted on the hatbox . I was frightened of it , thought about taking it to the ladies ' room , decided that would look suspicious , and opened it . I had a good memory in those days for poems , for what peoplesaid , for the looks of things , but it has long since been blurred by time . But I still remember every word of that note : " At the border , leave the candy box on the seat . Open this box and wear the hat . There is no thanks for what you will do for them . No thanks from me either . But there is the love I have for you . Julia . " I sat for a long time holding the note . I was in a state that I have known since I was old enough to know myself , and that to this day frightens me and makes me unable even to move my hands . I do not mean to be foolishly modest about my intelligence : it is often high , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain kind of simple problem , I sometimesmake it so complex that there is no way out . I simply do not see what another mind grasps immediately . I was there now . Julia had not told me where to open the hatbox . To take it into the corridor or toilet might make the two ladies opposite me suspicious . And so 1 sat doing nothing for a long time until I re-111Pentimentoalized that I did n't know when we crossed the border  --  a few minutes or a few hours . A decision had to be made but I could not make it . Childhood is less clear to me than to many people : when it ended I turned my face away from it for no reason that I know about , certainly without the usual reason of unhappy memories . For many years that worried me , but then I discovered that the tales of former children are seldom to be trusted . Some peoplesupply too many past victories or pleasures with which to comfort themselves , and other people cling to pains , real and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think I have always known about my memory : I know when it is to be trusted and when some dream or fantasy entered on the life , and the dream , the need of dream , led to distortion of what happened . And so I knew early that the rampage angers of an only child were distorted nightmares of reality . But I trust absolutelywhat I remember about Julia . Now , so many years later , I could climb the steps without a light , move in the night through the crowded rooms of her grandparents ' great Fifth Avenue house with the endless chic-shabby rooms , their walls covered with pictures , their tables crowded with objects whose value I did n't know . True , I can not remember anything said or done in that house except for the first night I was allowed to sleep there . Julia and I were both twelve years old that New Year 's Eve night , 112Juliasitting at a late dinner , with courses of fish and meats , and sherbets in between to change the tastes , " clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wateredwine for us , and red and white wine and champagnefor the two old people . ( Were they old ? I do n't know : they were her grandparents . ) I can not rememberany talk at the table , but after dinner we were allowed to go with them to the music room . A servant had already set the phonograph for " So Sheep May Safely Graze , " and all four of us listened until Julia rose , kissed the hand of her grandmother , the brow of her grandfather , and left the room , motioning for me to follow . It was an odd ritual , the whole thing , I thought , the life of the very rich , and beyond my understanding . Each New Year 's Eve of my life has brought back the memory of that night . Julia and I lay in twin beds and she recited odds and ends of poetry  --  every once in a while she would stop and ask me to recite , but I did n't know anything Dante in Italian , Heine in German @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the sounds were so lovely that I felt a sweet sadness as if much was ahead in the world , much that was going to be fine and fulfilling if I could ever find my way . I did recite Mother Goose and she did Donne 's " Julia , " and laughed with pleasure " at his tribute to me . " I was ashamed to ask if it was a joke . Very late she turned her head away for sleep , but I said , " More , Julia , please . Do you know more ? " And113Pentimentoshe turned on the light again and recited from Ovid and Catullus , names to me without countries . I do n't know when I stopped listening to look at the lovely face propped against the pillow  --  the lamp throwing fine lights on the thick dark hair . I can not say now that I knew or had ever used the words gentle or delicate or strong , but I did think that night that it was the most beautiful face I had ever seen . In later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when we were grown other people often said she was a " strange beauty , " she " looked like nobody else , " and one show-off said a " Burne-Jones face " when , of course , her face had nothing to do with Burne-Jones or fake spirituality . There were many years , almost twenty , between that New Year 's Eve and the train moving into Germany . In those years , and the years after Julia 's death , I have had plenty of time to think about the love I had for her , too strong and too complicated to be defined as only the sexual yearnings of one girl for another . And yet certainly that was there . I do n't know , I never cared , and it is now an aimless guessinggame . It does n't prove much that we never kissed each other ; even when I leaned down in a London funeral parlor to kiss the battered face that had been so hideously put back together , it was not the awful scars that worried me : because I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it and so I touched the face instead. 1/4JuliaA few years after that childhood New Year 's Eve , I was moved to a public school . ( My father was havinga bad time and could n't afford to pay for me anymore . ) But Julia and I saw each other almost every day and every Saturday night I still slept in her grandparents ' house . But , in time , our lives did change : Julia began to travel all summer and in winter holidays , and when she returned all my questions about the beauties of Europe would be shrugged off with badly photographed snapshots of things that interestedher : two blind children in Cairo  --  she explained that the filth carried by flies caused the blindness ; people drinking from sewers in Teheran ; no St. Mark 's but the miserable hovel of a gondolier in Venice ; no news of the glories of Vatican art but stories about the poverty of Trastevere . Once she returned with a framed photograph of a beautiful woman who was her mother and an Englishmanwho was her mother 's husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother in all the years I had never heard her mention her mother and she stared at me and said that her mother owned a " very fancy castle " and the new husband poured drinks for all the titles who liked the free stuff , but there was also mention of Evelyn Waugh and H. G. Wells and Nancy Cunard , and when I wanted news of them she said she did n't know anything about them , they 'd said hello to her and that she had only wanted to get out of the way and go to her room . " But I did n't have a room , " she said . " **25;391;TOOLONG a suite , and there are fourteen servants somewhere below the earth , and only some of them have a window in the cell my mother calls their room , and there 's only one stinking bath for all of them . My mother learns fast , wherever she is . She does not offend the host country . " Once , when we were about sixteen , we went with her grandparents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shabby as was every place they lived in . Both old people drank a good deal I think they always had , but I had only begun to notice itand napped after every meal . But they stayed awake late into the night doing intricate picture puzzles importedfrom France , on two tables , and gave each other large checks for the one who finished first . I do n't remember that Julia asked their permission for our camping trips  --  several times we stayed away for weekends  --  on or near Lake Champlain . It was n't proper camping , although we carried blankets and clean socks and dry shoes and canned food . We walked a great deal , often I fished for trout , and once , climbing a high hill , Julia threw a net over a rabbit , running with a grace and speed I had never before seen in a girl , and she showed me how to skin the rabbit . We cooked it that night wrapped in bacon and it is still among the best things I ever ate , maybe because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read . Even now , seeing any island , I am busy with that rabbit and fantasies of how I would make do alone , without shelter or tools. 116JuliaWhen we walked or fished we seldom did it side by side : that was her choice and I admired it because I believed she was thinking stuff I could n't understand and must n't interfere with , and maybe because I knew even then she did n't want to be side by side with anybody . At night , wrapped in our blankets , the fire between us , we would talk . More accurately , I would ask questionsand she would talk : she was one of the few peopleI have ever met who could give information withoutgiving a lecture . How young it sounds now that although I had heard the name of Freud , I never knew exactly what he wrote until she told me ; that Karl Marx and Engels became men with theories , instead of that one sentence in my school book which mentioned the Manifesto . But we also talked like all young people , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ versus environment , and can romantic love last , mixing stuff like that in speeches made only for the pleasure of girls on the edge of growing up . One night , when we had been silent for a long time because she was leaning on an elbow , close to the fire , reading a German grammar , I laughed at the sounds coming from her mouth as she repeated the sentences . She said , " No , you do n't understand . People are either teachers or students . You are a student . " " Am I a good one ? " " When you find what you want , you will be very good . " I reached out and touched her hand . " I love you , 117PentimentoJulia . " She stared at me and took my hand to her face . It was in our nineteenth year that she went away to Oxford . The second year she was there I went to visit her . There are women who reach a perfect time of life , when the face will never again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as powerful . It had happened that year to Julia , but she was no more conscious of it than she had been of being a beautiful child . Her clothes were ugly now , loose , tacky , and the shoes looked as if they had been stolen from an old man . Nobody came to her rooms because , as one smitten young Indian gentleman told me , she never asked anybody . She was invited everywhere in Oxford and in London , but the only names I remember her speaking of with respect were J. D. Bernal and J. B. S. Haldane . Once or twice we went up to the theatre in London , but she would sigh halfway through and say she had no feeling for the theatre , only Shakespeare on the page , and sometimes not even then . The following year she wrote to tell me that she was leaving England for medical school in Vienna , with the probably vain hope that Freud would someday accepther as a student . I wrote a number of letters that year , but the only time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , followed by the Toulouse-Lautrec drawing that hangs today in my house . I was pleased that she thought I knew the excellence of Toulouse-Lautrec , because I did n't , and had to be told about him by a fellow studentwho used to buy me hamburgers in order , I think , 118Juliato tell me about his homosexual experiences . ( He was a very decorated hero during the Second World War and was killed a week before it ended . ) A few months later I had a letter from Anne-Marie Travers , a girl whom Julia and I had both known in school , but I knew better because we had gone to the same dreadful summer camp . Anne-Marie was an intelligent girl , flirtatious , good-mannered with that kind of outward early-learned passive quality that in women so often hides anger . Now , it seemed , she was in or near Vienna and her unexpected letter I do n't think we had seen each other for four or five years  --  said she had bumped into Julia on the street and been " snubbed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strange life , very political , pretending not to be rich and living in the Floridsdorf district , the Socialist working-class " slums . " Julia ranked second in the medical school , she had been told , the first candidatebeing an American also but of a German inheritance , a very remarkable boy from San Francisco , handsome in the Norwegian way , she , Anne-Marie , did n't like . It took knowing Anne-Marie to realize that German and Norwegian used in the same sentencewas a combination of put-down and admiration . Anne-Marie added that her brother Sammy had recently tried to kill himself , and was I still torn betweenbeing a writer or an architect ? There was somethingstrange about the letter , some reason , some tone I did n't understand , did n't like . Then I forgot it for a month or so until her brother Sammy rang to ask me119Pentimentofor dinner , saying that he had been living in Elba and thinking of me . He said it again at dinner , having had four whiskeys with beer chasers , and asked me if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who had no interest in me , and I sensed something was to follow . At about four in the morning when we were sitting in Small 's in Harlem , and there had been many more whiskeys and beers , he asked me why I had got a divorce , why had n't I married his older brother Eliot , whose rich Detroit wife had lost all her money in the Depression , and so Eliot was again open to bids and would be right for me , although he himself thought Eliot a handsome bore . He said he rather liked his sister Anne-Marie , because he had slept with her when she was sixteen and he was eighteen . Then , perhaps because I made a sound , he said who the hell was I to talk , everybody knew about Julia and me . It is one of the strange American changes in custom that the drunks of my day often hit each other , but never in the kind of bar fight that so often happens now with knives . In those days somebody hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offered his hand and it would have been unheard of to refuse . ( James Thurber had once thrown a glass of whiskey at me in the famous Tony 's speakeasy , Hammett had pushed Thurber against a wall , Thurber had picked up a glass from another table and , in an attempt to throw it at Dash , missed and hit the waiter who was Tony 's cousin . Tony called the police , saying over and over again that he had had enough of Thurber120Juliathrough the years . Almost everybody agreed with Tony , but when the police came we were shocked and went down to the police station to say nothing had happened except a drunken accident of a broken glass ; and while I do n't think Thurber liked me afterward , I do n't think he had liked me before . In any case , none of us ever mentioned it again . ) And so , at that minute at the table at Small 's , there seemed to me nothing odd about what I did . I leaned across the table , slapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the table , and went home . The next day a girl called me to say that Sammy could n't remember what he had said but he was sorry , anyway , and a large amount of flowers arrived that evening . The girl called again a few days later : I said there were no hard feelings , but Sammy was a bigger dope at twenty-five than he had been at seventeen . She said she 'd tell him that . I wrote to Anne-Marie saying that whatever Julia thought or did was bound to be interesting , and that I did n't want to hear attacks on her beliefs or her life . My letter was returned , unopened or resealed , and it was to be another year before I knew why . Not long after , I had a letter from Julia suggesting that I come to Vienna for a visit , that Freud had acceptedher , that there were things I ought to learn about " the holocaust that is on its way . " I wrote back that I was living with Hammett , did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Subsequent letters from her talked of llitier , Jews , radicals , Mussolini. 121PentimentoWe wrote a great deal that year , 1933-1934 , and I told her that I was trying to write a play , had n't much hope about it , but that Hammett was pulling me along . I asked her if she liked The Children 's Hour as a title and was hurt when she forgot the question in her next letter , which was angry with news of the armed politicalgroups in Austria , the threat of Hitler , " the criminalguilt of the English and French in not recognizing the dangers of Fascism , German style , the other one is a peacock . " There was much in her letter I did n't understand , although all of us by that time knew that the Nazis would affect our lives . I could not write a history of those years as it seemed to us then . Or , more accurately , I could not write my own : I have no records and I do not know when I understood what . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no more than abig-talking man in silly uniforms had shaken manyof us into radicalism , or something we called radicalism , and that our raw , new convictions would , in time , bring schisms and ugly fights . But in the early ThirtiesI do n't believe the people I knew had done much more than sign protests , listen to the shocking stories of the few German emigres who had come to New York or Hollywood , and given money to one cause or another . We were disturbed by the anti-Semitism that was an old story in Germany and some of us had sense enough to see it as more than that . Many people thought of it as not much more than the ignorant rantingsof a house painter and his low-down friends , who would certainly he rejected hti the ( ; ernuans , who were122Juliafor my generation an " advanced , " " cultivated " people . But by 1935 or 1936 what had been only half understood , unsettling , distant stories turned horrortragicand new assessments had to be made fast of what one believed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rebels of the Twenties , the generation before mine , now seemed rebels only in the Scott Fitzgerald sense : they had wasted their blood , blind to the future they could have smelled if the odor of booze had n't been so strong . Scott knew this about himself , and understandably resented those old friends who had turned into the new radicals . But the 1920 's rebels had always seemed strange to me : without charity I thought most of them were no more than a classy lot of brilliant comics , performing at low fees for the society rich . The new radicalism was what I had always been looking for . In 1934 , Hammett and I rented a charming house on Long Island and were throwing around the money from The Thin Man . It had been a year of heavy drinking for both of us : I drank almost as much as Hammett and our constant guests , but I was younger than most of them and did n't like myself when I drank . In any case , work on The Children 's Hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature , had resolved on a new , lighter drinking program : nothing but sherry , port and beer . He was never drunker , never ate less , and was in a teasing , irritable mood . I wanted to get away from all of it . Hammett gave me the money to go to Europe . Because I planned to stay away for a long time to123Pentimentofinish the play , the money had to last as long as possible . I went directly to Paris , to the small and inexpensive Hotel Jacob , and decided to see nobody . Once a day I went for a walk , twice a day I ate in working-class restaurants , struggling through French newspapers or magazines . They did n't teach me much but I did know about the formation of the Popular Front . There had been , there were to be , Fascist riots in Paris that year . Like most Americans , now and then , political troubles in Europe seemed far away from my life and certainly far away from a play about a little girl who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private school . But after a month of nobody , I was lonely and tired of work . I telephoned Julia we had talked several times my first weeks in Paris  --  to say I 'd like to come to Vienna for a few days . She said that was n't a good idea at the minute , nor a good idea to talk on a telephone that was tapped , but she 'd meet me and would send a message saying where and when . I think that was the first time I ever knew a telephone could be listened in on , a life could and would he spied on . I was impressed and amused . I waited but no word came from Julia . Then , two weeks after my phone call , the newspaper headlines said that Austrian government troops , aided by local Nazis , had bombarded the Karl Marx Hof in the Floridsdorf district of Vienna . Socialist workers , who owned the district , had defended it , and two hundred of them had been killed . I read the news in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my dinner ran back to the hotel for my addressbook . But Julia 's address said nothing about the Karl Marx Hof or the Floridsdorf and so I went to bed telling myself not to imagine things . At five o'clock in the morning I had a telephone call from a man who said his name was Von Zimmer , he was calling from Vienna , Julia was in a hospital . I have no memory of the trip to Vienna , no memory of a city I was never to see again , no memory of the name of the hospital , nor how I got to it or in what language . But I remember everything after that . It was a small hospital in a mean section of town . There were about forty people in the ward . Julia 's bed was the first behind the door . The right side of her face was entirely in bandages , carried around the head and on to most of the left side , leaving only the left eye and the mouth exposed . Her right arm was lying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an unseenplatform . There were two or three people in uniformin the room , but most of the aides were in street clothes and it was a young boy , twelve or thirteen , who brought me a stool and said to Julia , in German , " Your friend has come , " as he turned her head so that she could see me with her left eye . Neither the eye nor the hand moved as she looked at me and neitherof us spoke . I have no loss of memory about that first visit : there was nothing to remember . After a while , she raised her right arm toward the center of the room and I saw the boy , who was carrying a pail , 125Pentimentospeak to a nurse . The nurse came to the bed and moved Julia 's head away from me and told me she thought I should come back the next day . As I went past the desk , the young boy met me in the hall and told me to ask for a room at the Hotel Sacher . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a place so much too expensive for me that I was about to take my bags and find another . The note said that the reservationhad been made at the Sacher because I would be safe there , and that was best for Julia . It was signed John Von Zimmer . I went back to the hospital later that evening and , as I got off the trolley car , I saw what I had not seen in the morning . The district was heavily ringed with police , and men in some other uniform . The hospital said I could n't go into the ward , the patient was asleep after the operation . When I asked what operation , they asked how was I related to the patient , but my German , and much else , had given out . I tried to find out if the hospital desk knew John Von Zimmer 's address , but they said they had never heard of him . I was refused at the hospital the next day and the next . Three days later a handsome , pregnant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , took me into the ward . The same young boy brought me the same stool , and gently turned Julia 's head toward me . Her right leg was no longer on a platform and that made me think everything was better . This time , after a few minutes , she raised her right arm and touched my hand . I stared at her hand : it had always been too large even126Juliafor this tall girl , too blunt , too heavy , ugly . She took the hand away , as if she knew what I thought , and I reached back for it . We sat for a while that way and then she pointed to her mouth , meaning that she could n't speak because of the bandages . Then she raised her hand to the window , pointed out , and made a pushing movement with her hand . I said , " I do n't know what you mean , " and realized they were the first words I had spoken to her in years . She made the motion again and then shut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After a while I fell asleep on the stool with my head against the wall . Toward afternoona nurse came and said I had to leave . Julia 's bed had been wheeled out and I think the nurse was telling me that she was being " treated . " For the three days and nights I had been in Vienna I had gone nowhere , not even for a walk , only once a day to a cheap restaurant a block from the hospital where the old man who ran it talked in English and said he had once lived in Pittsburgh . I do n't believe I understood where I was , or what had happened in this city , or why , and that I was too frightened of what I did n't understand to be anything more than quiet . ( Fear has always made me unable to talk or to move much , almost drowsy . ) I thought constantly about how to find the man called Von Zimmer , but it seemed to me each day that he would certainly come to me . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing more to read , was too restless and nervous for lied , and so I took the long walk back to the restau-127Pentimentorant near the hospital . When I got there it was closed and so I walked again until it was long past midnight , thinking how little I knew about Julia 's life , how seldomwe had met in the last years , how little I knew of what was happening to her now . When I got back to the hotel the young boy from the hospital ward was standing across the street . I saw him immediately and stood waiting for him . He handed me a folded slip of paper . Then he bowed and moved away . In the lobby of the hotel , the note , written in a weak , thin handwriting , said , " Something else is needed . They will take me tomorrow to another place . Go back to Paris fast and leave your address at the Sacher . Love , Julia . " I was back in Paris before I remembered that when we were kids , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then correcting . Often one of us would say to the other , " Something else is needed " ; we said it so often that it got to be a family joke . I waited in Paris for a month , but no word ever came . A German friend made a telephone call for me to the hospital in Vienna , but they said they did n't know Julia 's name , had no record of her ever having been there . My German friend telephoned the university twice to ask for John Von Zimmer , but once somebody said he no longer was enrolled and once they had no information about his address . And so I went back to New York , finished The128JuliaChildren 's Hour , and three nights after it was a successI telephoned Julia 's grandmother . I think the old lady was drunk  --  she often had been when we were young  --  because it took a long time to explain who I was , and then she said what difference did it make who I was , she did n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had been transmitting huge sums of money to her all over Europe , and she thought Julia was plain crazy . About a year later I had a letter from Julia , but it is lost now and while I am sure of what it said , I am not sure how it was said by a woman who wrote what had become almost foreign English and was telling me something she evidently thought I already knew . The letter had to do with Nazism and Germany , the necessity of a Socialist revolution throughout the world , that she had had a baby , and the baby seemed to like being called Lilly , but then she was a baby who liked almost everything . She said she had no address , but I should send letters to Paris , to 16 Rue de l'Universite , in care of apartment 3 . I wrote immediately to thank her about Lilly , then two more times , and finally had a postcard from her with a Zurich stamp . I can no longer remember how long after that AnneMarietelephoned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say yes when Anne-Marie told me that a friend of hers had seen Julia , that Julia was doing something called anti-Fascist work , very dangerous , and throwing away her money , did I know about the baby and was n't that nutty , a poor unwanted **26;418;TOOLONG child ? I said I was leaving town and could n't have dinner . Anne-Marie said that was too bad because they did n't often visit New York , but happened to be here on the opening night of Days to Come and had to say , frankly , that they had n't liked my play . I said that was n't illegal , not many people had liked it , and then there was more talk about Julia , something about her leg that I did n't understand , and Anne-Marie said that she wanted me to meet her husband , who , as I certainly knew , had been a colleague of Julia 's in medical school in Vienna and was now a surgeon , very successful , in San Francisco . She said he was brilliant and a real beauty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look " so attractive " was a constant phrase of my time and to hide my irritation I said I knew she had married but I did n't know his name . She said his name was John Von Zimmer . I am sure she heard me take a deep breath because she laughed and said the next time they came to New York she would call me , and why did n't I ever see Sammy , her brother , who was always trying to commit suicide . I was never to see Sammy again , but certainly he never committed suicide because I read about him in Suzy 's society column a few months ago . In all the years that followed I only once again saw Anne-Marie , with John Von Zimmer , in 1970 , when I was teaching in Berkeley . They were in a San Franciscorestaurant with six or seven other stylish-looking people , and Anne-Marie kissed me and hnWed and130Juliawe exchanged addresses . Von Zimmer was silent as he stared at a wall behind my head . Neither Anne-Marie nor I did the telephoning that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did want very much to see Von Zimmer : I had an old question to ask , and so a few days after the meeting in the restaurant I walked around to his office . But , standing near the great Victorian house , I changed my mind . I am glad now that I did n't ask the question that almost certainly would never have been answered . But on that day in 1937 , on the train moving toward the German border , I sat looking at the hatbox . The big girl was now reading the Frankfurter Zeitung , the thin girl had done nothing with the book that was lying on her lap . I suppose it was the announcement of the first lunch sitting that made me look up from the past , pick up my coat , and then put it down again . The thin girl said , " Nice coat . Warm ? Of what fur ? " " It 's sealskin . Yes , it 's warm . " She said , pointing to the hatbox , " Your hat is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know , realized how paralyzedI had been , knew it could n't continue , and opened the box . I took out a high , fluffy , hat of gray fox as both ladies murmured their admiration . I sat staring at it until the heavy girl said , " Put on . Nice with coat . " I suppose part of my worry , although I had n't even131Pentimentogot there yet , was what to do with the knitted cap I was wearing . I took it off and rose to fix the fur hat in the long mirror between the windows . The top and sides of the hat were heavy and when I put my hand inside I felt a deep seam in the lining with heavy wads below and around the seam . It was uncomfortable and so I started to take it off when I remembered that the note said I should wear the hat . Somewhere during my hesitations the heavy girl said she was going to lunch , could she bring me a sandwich ? I said I 'd rather go to lunch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and immediately realized I had made a silly and possibly dangerous remark . The thin girl said we would n't be crossing until late afternoon  --  she had unpacked a small box and was eating a piece of meat and if I was worried about my baggage she was staying in the compartmentbecause she could n't afford the prices in the dining car . The heavy girl said she could n't afford them either , but the doctor had said she must have hot meals and a glass of wine with her medicine . So I went off with her to the dining car , leaving my coat thrown over the candy box . We sat at a table with two other people and she told me that she had been studyingin Paris , had " contracted " a lung ailment , and was going home to Cologne . She said she did n't know what would happen to her Ph.D . dissertation because the lung ailment had affected her bones . She talked in a disjointed stream of words for the benefit , I thought , of the two men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the chatter went on as her head turned to watch everybody in a nervous tic between sentences . I was glad to be finished with lunch , so worried was I about the candy box , but it was there , untouched , when we got back to our compartment . The thin girl was asleep , but she woke up as we came in and said something in German to the heavy girl about a crowded train , and called her Louisa . It was the first indication I had that they knew each other , and I sat silent for a long time wondering why that made me uneasy . Then I told myself that if everything went on making me nervous , I 'd be in a bad fix by the time it came to be nervous . For the next few hours , the three of us dozed or read until the thin girl tapped me on the knee and said we would be crossing the border in five or ten minutes . I suppose everybody comes to fear in a different way , but I have always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything to do with the weather . Now , waiting , I was very hot . As the train pulled to a standstill , I got up to go outside  --  people were alreadyleaving the train to pass through a check gate , and men were coming on the train to inspect baggage in the cars ahead of us  --  without my coat or my new hat . I was almost out the compartment door when the thin girl said , " You will need your coat and hat . It is of a windiness . " " Thank you . But I 'm not cold . " Iler voice changed sharply , " You will have need of your coat . Your hat is nice on your head . " 133PentimentoI did n't ask questions because the tone in which she spoke was the answer . I turned back , put the coat around my shoulders , put on the hat that felt even heavier now with the wads of something that filled the lining , and let both girls go past me as I adjusted it in the mirror @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of me , separated from me by several people who had come from other compartments . The heavy girl moved on . The thin girl dropped her purse and , as she picked it up , stepped to one side and moved directly behind me . We said nothing as we waited in line to reach the two uniformed men at the check gate . As the man in front of me was having his passport examined , the thin girl said , " If you have a temporarytravel-through visa , it might take many minutes more than others . But that is nothing . Do not worry . " It did n't take many minutes more than others . I went through as fast as anybody else , turned in a neat line with the other travelers , went back to the train . The thin girl was directly behind me , but as we got to the steps of the train , she said , " Please , " and pushed me aside to climb in first . When we reached our compartment , the fat girl was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next to ours as they had some kind of good-natured discussion with a man who was opening his luggage . The thin girl said , " They are taking great time with the luggage . " As she spoke , she leaned over and picked up my candy box . She took off the ribbon and134Juliasaid , " Thank you . I am hungry for a chocolate . Most kind . " I said , " Please , please , " and knew I was never meant for this kind of thing . " I am carrying it to a friend for a gift . Please do not open it . " As the customsmen came into our compartment , the thin girl was chewing on a candy , the box open on her lap . I did not know much about the next few minutes except that all baggage was dragged down from the racks , that my baggage took longer than the baggage of my companions . I remember the heavy girl chatting away , and something being said about my traveling visa , and how I was going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( It was two days later before I realized I had never mentioned the Moscow theatre festival or anything about myself . ) And the name Hellman came into the conversation I could only half understand . One of the customs men said , " Jew , " and the heavy girl said certainly the name was not always of a Jew and gave examples of people and places I could n't follow . Then the men thanked us , replaced everything neatly , and bowed themselves out the door . Somewhere in the next hours I stopped being hot or cold and was not to be frightened again that day . The thin girl had neatly retied my candy box , but I do n't think any of us spoke again until the train pulled into the station . When the porters came on for the baggage , I told myself that now I should be nervous , 135Pentimentothat if the money had been discovered at the border gate nothing much could have happened because I was still close to France . Now was the time , therefore , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't the time , and I laughed at that side of me that so often panics at a moment of no consequence , so often grows listless and sleepy near danger . But there was to be no danger that day . The thin girl was right behind me on the long walk toward the station gate , people kissing and shaking hands all along the way . A man and a woman of about fifty came toward me , the woman holding out her arms and saying in English , " Lillian , how good it is to see you . How naughty of you not to stay more than a few hours , but even that will give us time for a nice visit  --  " as the thin girl , very close to me now , said , " Give her the candy box . " I said , " I am so glad to see you again . I have brought you a small gift , gifts  --  " but the box was now out of my hands and I was being moved toward the gate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thin girl had disappeared . The man said , " Go through the gate . Ask the man at the gate if there is a restaurant near the station . If he says Albert 's go to it . If he gives you another name , go to that one , look at it , and turn back to Albert 's , which is directly opposite the door you are facing . " As I asked the official at the gate about a restaurant , the man went past me . The official said please to step to one side , he was busy , would take care of me in a136Juliaminute . I did n't like being in the station so I crossed the street to Albert 's . I went through a revolving door and was so shocked at the sight of Julia at a table that I stopped at the door . She half rose , called softly , and I went toward her with tears that I could n't stop because I saw two crutches lying next to her and now knew what I had never wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holding to the table , she said , " Fine , fine . I have ordered caviar for us to celebrate , Albert had to send for it , it wo n't be long . " She held my hand for several minutes , and said , " Fine . Everything has gone fine . Nothing will happen now . Let 's eat and drink and see each other . So many years . I said , " How long have we got ? How far is the other station , the one where I get the train to Mos-cow ? " " You have two hours , but we have n't that long together because you have to be followed to the stationand the ones who follow you must have time to find the man who will be with you on the train until Warsaw in the morning . " I said , " You look like nobody else . You are more beautiful now . " She said , " Stop crying about my leg . It was amputatedand the false leg is clumsily made so I am coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon as I can , and get a good one . Lilly , do n't cry for me . Stop the tears . We must finish the work now . Take off the hat the way you would if it was too hot for this137Pentimentoplace . Comb your hair , and put the hat on the seat between us . " Her coat was open , and the minute I put the hat on the bench she pinned it deep inside her coat with a safety pin that was ready for it . She said , " Now I am going to the toilet . If the waiter tries to help me up , wave him aside and come with me . The toilet locks . If anybody should try to open it , knock on the door and call to me , but I do n't think that will happen . " She got up , picked up one of the crutches , and waved me to the other arm . She spoke in German to a man I guess was Albert as we moved down the long room . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it caught at a wrong angle , and she made a gesture with the crutch , tearing at it in irritation . When she came out of the toilet , she smiled at me . As we walked back to the table , she spoke in a loud voice , saying something in German about the toilet and then , in English , " I forget you do n't know German . I was saying that German public toilets are always clean , much cleaner than ours , particularly under the new regime . The bastards , the murderers . " Caviar and wine were on the table when we sat down again and she was cheerful with the waiter . When he had gone away she said , " Ah , Lilly . Fine , fine . Nothing will happen now . But it is your right to know that it is my money you brought in and we can save five hundred , and maybe , if we can bargain right , a thousand people with it . So believe that you have1,38Juliabeen better than a good friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Jews ? " " About half . And political people . Socialists , Communists , plain old Catholic dissenters . Jews are n't the only people who have suffered here . " She sighed . " That 's enough of that . We can only do today what we can do today and today you did it for us . Do you need something stronger than wine ? " I said I did n't and she said to talk fast now , there was n't much time , to tell her as much as possible . I told her about my divorce , about the years with Hammett . She said she had read The Children 's Hour , she was pleased with me , and what was I going to do next ? I said , " I did it . A second play , a failure . Tell me about your baby . " " She 's fat and handsome . I 've got over minding that she looks like my mother . " " I want very much to see her . " " You will , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I come home for the new leg and she can live with you , if you like . " I said , meaning no harm , " Could n't I see her now ? " " Are you crazy ? Do you think I would bring her here ? Is n't it enough I took chances with your safety ? I will pay for that tonight and tomorrow and . . . " Then she smiled . " The baby lives in Mulhouse , with some nice folks . I see her that way whenever I cross the border . Maybe , when I come back for the leg , I'll139Pentimentoleave her with you . She should n't be in Europe . It ai n't for babies now . " " I have n't a house or even an apartment of any permanence , " I said , " but I 'll get one if you bring the baby . " " Sure . But it would n't matter . You 'd be good to her . " Then she laughed . " Are you as angry a woman as you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I said . " I try not to be , but there it is . " " Why do you try not to be ? " " If you lived around me , you would n't ask . " " I 've always liked your anger , " she said , " trusted it . " " You 're the only one , then , who has . " " Do n't let people talk you out of it . It may be uncomfortablefor them , but it 's valuable to you . It 's what made you bring the money in today . Yes , I 'll leave the baby with you . Its father wo n't disturb you , he wants nothing to do with the baby or with me . He 's O.K. Just an ordinary climber . I do n't know why I did it , Freud told me not to , but I do n't care . The baby 's good . " She smiled and patted my hand . " Someday I will take you to meet Freud . What am I saying ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only so much longer to last in Europe . The crutches make me too noticeable . The man who will take care of you has just come into the street . Do you see him outside the window ? Get up and go now . Walk across the street , get a taxi , take it to Bahnhof 200 . Another man will140Juliabe waiting there . He will make sure you get safely on the train and will stay with you until Warsaw tomorrow morning . He is in car A , compartment 13 . Let me see your ticket . " I gave it to her . " I think that will be in the car to your left . " She laughed . " Left , Lilly , left . Have you ever learned to tell left from right , south from north ? " " No . I do n't want to leave you . The train does n't go for over an hour . I want to stay with you a few more minutes . " " No , " she said . " Something could still go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that should happen . I 'll be coming to New York in a few months . Write from Moscow to American Express in Paris . I have stuff picked up every few weeks . " She took my hand and raised it to her lips . " My beloved friend . " Then she pushed me and I was on my feet . When I got to the door I turned and must have taken a step back because she shook her head and moved her face to look at another part of the room . I did not see the man who followed me to the station . I did not see the other man on the train , although several times a youngish man passed my compartment and the same man took the vacant chair next to me at dinner , but did n't speak to me at all . When I went back to my compartment from dinner the conductor asked if I wanted my two small valises put in the corridor for examination when we crossed the German-Polish border so that I would n't be awakened . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bag-141Pentimentogage car , handed him the key for the customs people , and went to sleep on the first sleeping pill of my life , which may be why I did n't wake up until just before we pulled into the Warsaw station at seven in the morning . There was bustle in the station as I raised the curtain to look out . Standing below my window was the young man who had sat next to me at dinner . He made a gesture with his hand , but I did n't understand and shook my head . Then he looked around and pointed to his right . I shook my head again , bewildered , and he moved away from the window . In a minute there was a knock on my door and I rose to open it . An English accent said through the crack , " Good morning . Wanted to say goodbye to you , have a happy trip . " And then , very , very softly , " Your trunk was removed by the Germans . You are in no danger because you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then ask the Polish conductorabout the trunk . Do n't return from Moscow through Germany , travel another way . " In a loud voice he said , " My best regards to your family , " and disappeared . For two hours I sat in bed , doubtful , frightened of the next move , worried about the loss of clothes in my trunk . When I got dressed , I asked the Polish conductorif the German conductor had left my trunk key with him . He was upset when he told me the German customs people had removed the trunk , that often happened , but he was sure it would be sent on to me in142JuliaMoscow after a few days , nothing unusual , the Germanswine often did it now . The trunk did arrive in Moscow two weeks later . The lining was in shreds , the drawers were broken , but only a camera was missing and four or five books . I did not know then , and I do not know now , whether the trunk had anything to do with Julia because I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was never to speak with Julia again . I wrote to her from Moscow , again from Prague on my way back to Paris , and after I had returned to New York from Spain during the Civil War . Three or four months later I had a card with a Geneva postmark . It said , says , " Good girl to go to Spain . Did it convince you ? We 'll talk about that when I return to New York in March . " But March and April came and went and there was no word from Julia . I telephoned her grandmother , but I should have known better . The old lady said they had n't heard from Julia in two years and why did I keep worrying her ? I said I had seen Julia in October and she hung up the phone . Somewhere about that time I saw a magazine picture of Julia 's mother , who had just married again , an Argentine , but I saw no reason for remembering his name . On May 23 , 1938 , I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the wrong address . It said , " Julia has been killed stop please advise Moore 's funeral home Whitechapel Road London what **25;446;TOOLONG stop my sorrow for you for all of us . " It was signed John Watson but had no address . It is never possible for me to cry at the time when it could do me some good , so , instead , I got very drunk for two days and do n't remember anything about them . The third morning I went around to Julia 's grandmother 's house and was told by the butler , who came out on the street as if I were a danger to the house , that the old people were on a world cruise and would n't be back for eight weeks . I asked the name of the boat , was asked for my credentials , and by the time we batted all that around , I was screaming that their granddaughter was dead and that he and they could go fuck themselves . I was so sick that night that Dash , who never wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he thought I should go to London right away . I have no diary notes of that trip and now only the memory of standing over a body with a restored face that did n't hide the knife wound that ran down the left side . The funeral man explained that he had tried to cover the face slash but I should see the wounds on the body if I wanted to see a mess that could n't be covered . I left the place and stood on the street for a while . When I went back in the funeral man handed me a note over the lunch he was eating . The note said , " Dear Miss Hellman . We have counted on your comingbut perhaps it is not possible for you , so I will send a carbon of this to your New York address . None of us knows what disposition her family wishes to144Juliamake , where they want what should be a hero 's funeral . It is your right to know that the Nazis found her in Frankfurt , in the apartment of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of saving her . Sorry that I can not be here to help you . It is better that I take my sorrow for this wonderful woman into action and perhaps revenge . Yours , John Watson , who speaks here for many others . Salud . " I went away that day and toward evening telephonedthe funeral man to ask if he had an address for John Watson . He said he had never heard the name John Watson , he had picked up the body at the house of a Dr. Chester Lowe at 30 Downshire Hill . When I got there it was a house that had been made into apartments , but there was no Dr. Lowe on the name plates , and for the first time it occurred to me that my investigations could be bad for people who were themselves in danger . So I brought the body home with me on the old De Grasse and tried this time to reach Julia 's mother . The same butler told me that he could n't give me her mother 's address , although he knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had the body cremated and the ashes are still where they were that day so long ago . I should , of course , have gone to Mulhouse before I came home from London , but I did n't , did n't even think about it in those awful days in London or on the boat . After the cremation , I wrote to Julia 's grandmother , 145Pentimentotold her about the baby and that I knew nothing more than that she lived with a family in Mulhouse , but Mulhouse could n't be so big that they would have troublefinding an American child . I had no answer . I guess I knew I would n't , and so I wrote another letter , this time nasty , and got an answer from a fancy name in a fancy law firm saying that everything would be done " in this strange case " about a child only I believed existed and I would be kept informed of any " doubtful results . " In the next few months , I found I dreamed every night about Julia , who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hammett said I looked awful and if it worried me that much why did n't I find a lawyer or a detective in Mulhouse . William Wyler , the movie director , with whom I had made two pictures , had been born in Mulhouse and his family still owned a department store there . It is too long ago for me to be accurate about when and how he got me the name of a lawyer in Mulhouse , but he did , and after a while the lawyer wrote that the investigationwas proving difficult , but he thought , in the end , they would certainly find the baby if she was still there . Three months later the war broke out and I never heard again from anybody in Western Europe until I arrived in London from Russia in March 19411 . My second day there  --  my reason for being there was to do a documentary film for the British government about people on the docksides during tin ' V 2 bomb-146Juliaings I realized I was somewhere in the neighborhood of the funeral parlor . I found it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is left of all this except that sometime in the early 1950 's , I was sitting on a stone wall at a Long Island picnic at Ruth and Marshall Field 's . A man next to me was talking about a man called Onassis  --  the first time I had heard his name  --  and a lawsuit by the U.S. government against Onassis , and when he was finished with that he turned to me and said , " My father was the lawyer to whom you wrote about Julia . I am Julia 's third cousin . " After a while I said , " Yes . " He said , " My father died last year . " " Your father never wrote to me again . " He said , " You see , I 'm not a lawyer , I 'm a banker . " I said , " Whatever happened to her family ? " " The grandparents are dead . Julia senior lives inArgentina  --  " " The bastards , " I said , " all of them . " He smiled at me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they ever find the baby they did n't want to find ? I do n't care who you are . " " I never knew anything about a baby , " he said . I said , " I do n't believe you , " got off the stone fence , left a note for Ruthie saying I did n't feel well , and drove home. 147THEATREIT is strange to me that so many people like to listen to so many other people talk about the theatre . There are those who talk for large fees or give it away at small dinner parties and often their stories are charming and funny , but they are seldom people who have done much solid work . You are there , you are good in the theatre , you have written or directed or acted or designed just because you have and there is little that you can or should be certain about because almost everything in the theatre contradicts something else . People have come together , as much by accident as by design , done the best they can and sometimes the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see each other the next week , mean it , and wave across a rl ) Onl a few years later . The manuscript , the words on the page , was what151Pentimentoyou started with and what you have left . The productionis of great importance , has given the play the only life it will know , but it is gone , in the end , and the pages are the only wall against which to throw the future or measure the past . How the pages got there , in their form , in their order , is more of a mystery than reason would hope for . That is why I have never wanted to write about the theatre and find the teaching of English literature more rewarding than teaching drama . ( Drama usually means " the theatre , " the stories about it , chatter of failure and success . ) You are good in boats not alone from knowledge , but because water is a part of you , you are easy on it , fear it and like it in such equal parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it and may be even safer because you do n't need to think too much . That is what we mean by instinct and there is no way to explain an instinct for the theatre , although those who have it recognize each other and a bond is formed between them . The need of theatre instinct may be why so many good writers have been such inferior playwrights  --  the light that a natural dramatist can see on a dark road is simply not there . There are , of course , other reasons why I have not written about the theatre : I have known for many years that part of me struggled too hard within it , and the reasons for that I do not know and they could not , in any case , be of interest to anybody but152Theatreme . I always knew that I was seldom comfortable with theatre people although I am completely comfortable in a theatre ; and I am now at an age when the cutting up of old touches must be carefully watched and any sentence that begins " I remember " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself say it . But I have certain pictures , portraits , mementos of my plays . They are what I have left of the long years , the pleasure in the work and the pains . The Children 's Hour was my first play . I do n't remembervery much about the writing or the casting , but I remember Lee Shubert , who owned the theatre , as he did many other theatres in New York , coming down the aisle to stare at me during a rehearsal day . I was sitting mid-theatre with my feet on the top of the chair in front of me . He came around to stand directlybefore me and said , " Take your dirty shoes off my chair . " I said , " My shoes are n't touching the chair , Mr. Shubert , " but , after a pause , he pushed my right leg to the floor . I said , " I do n't like strange men fooling around with my right leg so do n't do it again . " Mr. Shubert called out to Herman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ row . They met in the aisle and I heard Herman say , " That girl , as you call her , is the author of the play , " and went back to directing . About half an hour later , Mr. Shubert , 153Pentimentowho had been standing in the back watching the play for which he had put up the money , came down and sat behind me . " This play , " he said to the back of my head , " could land us all in jail . " He had been watching the confessionscene , the recognition of the love of one woman for another . I said , " I am eating a frankfurter and I do n't want to think about jail . Would you like a piece of it ? " " I forbid you to get mustard on my chairs , " he said and I was never to see him again until the play had been running for about six months and then I heard him ask the doorman who I was . I 've always told myself that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Hour because I had begun to drink two nights before . I had gone to have dinner with my mother and father , who had not read the play , had not seen the rehearsals , had asked no questions , but , obviously , had talked to each other when they were alone . Both of them were proud of me , but in my family you did n't show such things , and both of them , I think , were frightened for me in a world they did n't know . In any case , my mother , who frequently made sentencesthat had nothing to do with what went before , said , in space , " Well , all I know is that you were considered the sweetest-smelling baby in New Orleans . " She had , through my life , told me this several timesbefore , describing how two strange ladies had pausedin front of our house to stare at me in the baby car-154Theatreriage and then to lean down and sniff me . One of them had said , " That 's the sweetest-smelling baby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In all New Orleans , " and when my mother told our neighbor about her pleasure in this exchange , the neighbor had said of course it was true , famously true , I always smelled fresh as a flower . I did n't know that my mother had never until that night told my father or , if she had , he was less nervous than he was two nights before the opening . Now , when she repeated it , he said , " Who was the sweetest-smellingbaby in New Orleans ? " " Lillian , " said my mother . " Lillian ? Lillian ? " said my father . " I was the sweetest-smelling baby in New Orleans and you got that information from my mother and sisters and have stolen it . " " Stolen it ? " said my shocked mother . " I never stole anything in my life and you know it . Lillian was the sweetest-smelling baby in New Orleans and I can prove it . " " It 's disgraceful , " said my father , " what you aredoing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said about me , and given it to your own child . " " Your child , too , " said my mother . " That 's no reason for lying and stealing , " said my father . " I must ask you now to take it back and not to repeat it again . " My mother was a gentle woman and would do almostanything to avoid a fight , but now she was aroused as I had never before seen her. 155Pentimento " I will take nothing back . You are depriving your own child of her rightful honor and I think it dis-graceful . " My father rose from the table . " I will telephone Jenny and prove it to you , " he said . He was giving the phone operator the number of his sisters ' house in New Orleans when my mother yelled , " Jenny and Hannah will say anything you tell them to . I wo n't have it . Lillian was the sweetestsmellingbaby in New Orleans and that 's that . " She began to cry . I said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I went to the sideboard and poured myself a large straight whiskey . My father , holding the phone , said to me , " Sweet-smelling , are you ? You 've been drinking too much for years . " " Do n't pay him any mind , baby , " said my mother , " any man who would deny his own child . " I left before my father spoke to his sisters and only found out months later that although my mother and father came to the opening night together , and both of them kissed me , they did n't speak to each other for several days . On the afternoon of the opening night of The Children'sHour I drowned the hangover with brandy . I think I saw the play from the back of the theatre , holding to the rail , but I am not sure : I do remember the final curtain and an audience yelling , " Author , author . " It was not all modesty that kept me from the curtain call  --  I could n't have made backstage with-156Theatreout falling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the excited noise that comes only when the authoris unknown and will never come again in quite so generous a fashion . I remember Robert Benchley pressing my arm and nodding his head as he passed me on his way out of the theatre . It was a nice thing for a critic to do , but I do n't think I knew what he meant . I knew only half-things that happened that night : I went to the Plaza Hotel , but I ca n't remember who was at the table ; I went to Tony 's with some people who were at the Plaza ; I went to Herman 's apartment and he told me that the papers were very good indeed and we would be a big hit and he had a bad headache . For the next few hours I have no account . Then I was in a strange bar , not unusual for me in those days , and I was talking to a man and two women . Or they were talking to me and the conversation had to do with the metallic fringe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dress . Then I was asleep , sittingup , on my couch in the Elysee Hotel . When I woke up one of the women was watering the plants on the windowsill and the other woman was crying , standingagainst a wall . I said to the man , " Are these your sisters ? " and he laughed . " What 's funny about that ? " " Sez you , " he said , " sez you . " " I 'm going to marry him , " said the one who was standing against the wall , " and it 's already shit . Everybody has missed the boat , everywhere , everywhere , everywhere and somehow . " 157Pentimento " Ssh , " I said , " I owe this hotel a lot of money . " " The boat , " she screamed , " everybody , every-where . " There was some more of that . I went to make coffee and when I came back the pair who were going to get married were sitting on the couch holding hands and the one who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the desk . ( I was to meet her again a few years later . She was a handsome , boyish-lookingwoman at every society-literary cocktail party . Her name was Emily Vanderbilt and she was to marry Raoul Whitfield , a mystery story writer . A few years after the marriage she was murdered on a ranch they bought in New Mexico , and neither the mystery story expert nor the police ever found the murderer . ) Nobody spoke until the potential bride suddenly pushed her fiance off the couch , and the one reading the telegrams screamed , " Moxie ! Moxie ! " I said  --  I think it was the sentence I most often used in those years  --  " Why do n't you all go home ? " The man had picked himself up from the floor , was pouring himself a drink , Moxie and her friend were arguing about something or other , when I went in the bedroom shouting , " Why do n't you all go home , " and locked the door . It was still dark , maybe six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cramps in my legs , remembering that I should have telephonedHammett , who was in Hollywood , to tell him the play was a hit . I wanted a cold beer and went through the living room to get it . I thought the room158Theatrewas empty , but as I was returning to bed with my beer , I saw the man sitting at the desk staring out of the window . I coughed and he turned to me , raising his empty highball glass . " Want to get me a fresh drinkie ? " " What did you do with your ladies ? " " I certainly would like an eensy drink . " " I do n't feel well . I have work to do . I have to make a phone call . I had a play open last night . " " You kept saying that , " he said . " I 'm a doctor . " " You 're a doctor ? " " Opening an office next week , Park and 80th , going in with my uncle , the heart specialist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't think I 'd do that and put a call through to Hammett in the rented house with the soda fountain in the Pacific Palisades . After a long time a woman answered the phone and said she was Mr. Hammett 's secretary , what a strange hour to be calling . I sat on the couch thinking about that and feeling very dizzy from the beer . The doctor said , " What 's your name ? " I went back to the bedroom , closed the door , and knew the question had sobered me up . I had wasted what should have been the nicest night of my life . I disliked then and dislike now those who spoil pleasure or luck when it comes not so much because they refuseit  --  they are a different breed  --  but because they can not see it or abandon it for blind nonsense . I had done just that and wanted now to find out about it. 159PentimentoThe doctor opened the door . " Do you want to go out for breakfast or Atlantic City ? What 's your name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Peregrine Perry . From Lord Perry of long ago . " " Do they call you Perry Perry ? " " Oh , Christ , " he said , " all you have to do is wait for it . " He closed the door , and when I woke up that afternoonthe apartment was empty . ( Ten years later I bought a house on 82nd Street and somewhere in that first year I saw him come out of an office with a sign on it that said " Dr. P. John Perry " and get into a car driven by a chauffeur . ) But long before that , two days after the woman had told me she was Hammett 's secretary , I realized that I had called Hammett at three A.M. California time and that he had no secretary . We had spoken on the phone a number of times in those days he was very happy about The Children 's Hour , proud that all his trouble with me had paid off  --  but on the day I understoodabout the secretary and three o'clock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . By the time I got to the house in the Pacific Palisades it was night and I had had a good deal to drink . I went immediately to the soda fountain Hammett had rented the house from Harold Lloyd  --  smashed it to pieces and flew back to New York on a late night plane . The failure of a second work is , I think , more damagingto a writer than failure ever will he again . It is160Theatrethen that the success of the first work seems an accidentand , if the fears you had as you wrote it were dissipated by the praise , now you remember that the praise did not always come from the best minds and even when it did it could have been that they were not telling the truth or that you had played good tricks . And you are probably too young , too young at writing , to have found out that you really only care what a few people think ; only they , with the change in names that time brings about , will stand behind your chair for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theatre is more public , more brilliant , more unreal than in any other field . The praise is usually out of bounds : the photographs , interviews , " appearances , " party invitationsare so swift and dazzling that you go into the second work with confidence you will never have again if you have any sense . Days to Come was written in Princeton , New Jersey . Hammett , who never wanted much to live in New York , had rented the lovely house of a rich professor who was a Napoleon expert . Its overformal Directoire furniture was filled each night with students who liked Hammett , but liked even better the free alcohol and the odd corners where they could sleep and bring their friends . That makes it sound like now , when students are often interesting , but it was n't : they were a dull generation , but Dash never much examined the people to whom he was talking if he was drunk enough to talk at all . Even now the pains I had on the opening night of161PentimentoDays to Come puzzle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disasters , and there were so many that night that they should , in time , have passed into comedy : the carefully rehearsed light cues worked as if they were meant for another play ; the props , not too complicated , showed up where nobody had ever seen them before and broke , or did n't break , with the malice of animated beings ; good actors knew by the first twenty minutes they had lost the audience and thus became bad actors ; the audience , maybe friendly as it came in , was soon restless and uncomfortable . The air of a theatre is unmistakable : things go well or they do not . They did not . Standing in the back of the side aisle , I vomited without knowing it was going to happen and went home to change my clothes . I wanted , of course , to go to bed and stay there , but I was young enough to worry about cowardiceand so I got back in time to see William RandolphHearst lead his six guests out of the theatre , in the middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came up the aisle . It is hard for me to believe these many years later in the guilt I felt for the failure of Days to Come ; the threads of those threads have lasted to this day . Guilt is often an excuse for not thinking and maybe that 's what happened to me . In any case , it was to be two years before I could write another play , The Little Foxes , and when I did get to it I was so scared that I wrote it nine times . Up to a year ago I used to think of Days to Come162Theatreas the play that taught me not to vomit . ( I have never vomited again . ) Reading it then , for a book that includesall my plays , I liked it : it is crowded and overwrought , but it is a good report of rich liberals in the 1930 's , of a labor leader who saw through them , of a modern lost lady , and has in it a correct prediction of how conservative the American labor movement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had had an offer to write movies for Samuel Goldwyn . I think Mr. Goldwyn was in his early fifties when we first met , but he was so vigorous and springy that I was not conscious of his age for many years . He was , as were many of the bright , rough , tough lot that first saw the potential of the motion picture camera , a man of great power . Often the power would rise to an inexplicable pitch of panic anger when he was crossed or disappointed , and could then decline within minutes to the whispered , pained moral talk of a loony clergyman whimpering that God had betrayed him . What I liked best were not Mr. Goldwyn 's changes of English speech , although some of them were mighty nice and often better than the original . Certainly " I took it all with a dose of salts " is just as good as a grain ; the more famous " a verbal contract is n't worth the paper it is written on " makes sense ; he meant to be courteous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of you " to those of us on the dock , as he , a passenger , sailed away ; and when , soon after the war , he was asked to163Pentimentomake a toast to Field Marshal Montgomery , and rose , lifted his glass , and said , " A long life to Marshall Field Montgomery Ward , " one knew exactly why . But I liked best his calculated eccentricities . When he needed a favor or had to make a difficult bargain and knew a first move was not the best position from which to deal , he was brilliant . I was in his office when he wanted an actor under contract to Darryl Zanuck and demanded that Zanuck 's secretary call him out of a meeting . After a long wait , Mr. Goldwyn said into the phone , " Yes , Darryl ? What can I do for you today ? " And a few years after the McCarthy period , during which I was banned in Hollywood , my phone rang in Martha 's Vineyard . Mr. Goldwyn 's secretary and I had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reach me for two days to ask if I wanted to write Porgy and Bess . After a long wait Mr. Goldwyn 's voice said , " Hello , Lillian , hello . Nice of you to call me after all these years . How can I help you ? " But I think our early days together worked well because I was a difficult young woman who did n't care as much about money as the people around me and so , by accident , I took a right step within the first months of working for Mr. Goldwyn . I had been hired to rewritean old silly , hoping I could make it O.K. , to be directed by Sidney Franklin , a famous man who had done many of the Norma Shearer pictures . It was then , and often still is , the custom to talk for weeks and months before the writer is allowed to touch the typewriter . Such conferences were called breaking the164Theatreback of the story and that is , indeed , an accurate description . We , a nice English playwright called MordauntShairp and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at ten , have a refined health lunch a few hours later , and leave at five . The next day whatever we had decided would sometimes be altered and sometimesbe scrapped because Franklin had consulted a friend the night before or discussed our decisions with his bridge partners . After six or seven weeks of this , Franklin said it was rude of me to lie all day on his couch with my back turned to him , napping . I left his house saying I was sorry , it was rude , but I could n't go on that way . I took the night plane to New York , locked myself in with some books , and the first telephonecall I answered two days later was from Mr. Goldwyn , who said if I came back immediately I could go to a room by myself , start writing , and he 'd give me a raise . I said I 'd think about it , did n't , and left for Paris . When he found me there a week later he offered a long-term contract with fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them where and when I liked . I had become valuable to Mr. Goldwyn because I had left him for reasons he did n't understand . For many years that made me an unattainable woman , as desirable as such women are , in another context , for men who like them that way . They were good years and most of the time I enjoyedMr . Goldwyn . The extraordinary conflicts in a man who wished to make " fine pictures " and climb into an educated or social world while grappling at165Pentimentothe same time with a nature made rough by early poverty and tough by later big money amused me , and made him far more interesting than more " civilized " men like Irving Thalberg . ( I never understoodScott Fitzgerald 's The Last Tycoon version of Thalberg : the romanticism that went into that portrait had , in my mind , little to do with the obvious man who had once offered me a job by telling me how lucky I would be to work with him . ) But , as in the theatre , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pictures , although I have sharp recollections of much that happened outside the work . And maybe , in the end , they are the same tale . I had known George Haight in New York as a bright young man from Yale who had written GoodbyeAgain , a funny play . One of his friends , his excollegeroommate , I think , was a director , Henry C. Potter , and now all three of us were in Hollywood , George working as some kind of executive for Goldwyn . No two men , Haight and Potter , could have been more unalike : George was loose-limbed , sloppy , gay , wonderful at magicians ' tricks , full of nice jokes ; Potter was prep-school handsome , respectable , grandsonof a bishop , an unexpected man for the world of the theatre or Hollywood . I was glad to find George working for Goldwyn : it was nice to wander into his office for an hour 's exhibition of his newest card tricks or to have him wander into mine for a long afternoon'ssleep . I no longer remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opening of what play and on my way to write what movie script . It was the custom then in some parts of Europe and most of Latin America to sell small boxes of wax matches with pictures of movie stars pasted to the box . I do n't know what publicity department sent Henry C. Potter 's picture out to what match factory  --  he did look like the cleanest of juvenilesbut I came across two boxes and , to please George Haight , gave the head bellboy at the Hotel National five dollars and the promise of a dollar a box for any more he could find . I arrived in Hollywood with nine Henry C. Potter matchboxes and for days George had them laid out on his desk brooding over them . Then he told me that Potter was giving a cocktail party in a few weeks and he thought he had the answer : we were to stamp twenty-seven condoms with the words " Compliments of Henry C. Potter , " roll them three to a box , and he , Haight , would distribute them on tables @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his hands and knew where all gadgetswere to be bought , we did not foresee , that day of our pleasure , the awful work that was to come . George bought the stamps , the delicate knives , a small stove to melt the wax that would be used to make the words and , during the first few days , the condoms in the drugstore opposite the studio . I was not skillful , but to my surprise he was n't either . The carefully carved stamps broke the condoms because hot wax made holes and cool wax would n't take . After n ti-uc our drugstore ran out of condoms and one of167Pentimentothe lasting minutes my eyes will hold is the picture of the owner as he stared at George on his last requestfor twelve boxes . When George was unable to persuade me that it was my turn to find a new place to buy condoms , we had a cool day of not talking to each other . But the following morning he showed up with a dozen more boxes , fresh stamps , a more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . By the third or fourth day of our secondweek we had given up all other work . Haight 's secretary had , from the first , been posted at the door to keep out visitors , but now I refused two conferenceswith Mr. Goldwyn on the grounds that I first had to try out my ideas on Haight , who had nothing to do with the picture I was writing . And by that time we were not in a good humor with each other  --  I thought he was not as skillful as he once was , and he said I was clumsy and that he should have known it . One day , in fact , miserable and tired , we raised our voices to the point where the music department , situated in the building directly behind , came to their windows to watch the waving about of ruined condoms , and I yelled at them to mind their business . I can no longer remember how we solved the stamping , but we did , and there were twenty-seven perfect condoms laid out on a table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Potter . " We quit work early that day , but after enough celebrating drinks we forgot why we had left the studio and went to gamble in the Clover Club and got back to the studio about168Theatrefive in the morning because George said we only had two more days before the cocktail party and I had wasted enough of Mr. Goldwyn 's money . It was good we went back so early because a new and even more trying period was ahead : how to roll the things so that three , even two , could go neatly in the small boxes . We rolled them around toothpicks , we whittled sticks , we shaved down pencils , we straightened paper clips and hairpins , but it was obvious they were too wide for the matchboxes . They were bad days , growing dangerous : Goldwyn 's legal department wanted to see me about something or other and reported to Goldwyn that I said I was home with an abscessed tooth . That did n't fit with Goldwyn 's having seen me arrive at the studio on William Wyler'smotorcycle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't go immediately to a dentist , I forgot what I had told the legal department and said I did n't understand how a dentist could cure a badly sprained neck . Sam said that was odd , would I come immediately and talk to him , something strange was going on . George said I was a dope of a liar ; I said I was not meant to spend my life on condoms and was ready to throw over the whole thing . He said I was a fink , and while we were being nasty to each other my elderly secretary , who knew nothing more through those days than that I was missing from my office , opened George 's door to say his secretary was n't feeling well and could n't come to work , and stared down at the condoms . She was an unfriendly woman , but I heard George say to her , 169Pentimento " We have a problem . Have you ever rolled a condom ? " I left his office to hide in the toilet and came back to find that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roll the condoms , we were to fold them lengthwise , crosswise , and stack them . George took them to the cocktail party , but either Potter never knew about the condoms or was smart enough not to give George the pleasure of his complaint . In any case , George and I never spoke about them again . Ten of the twelve plays I have written are connected to Hammett he was in the Army in the Aleutian Islandsduring the Second World War for one of them , and he was dead when I wrote the last  --  but The Little Foxes was the one that was most dependent on him . We were living together in the same house , he was not doing any work of his own , but after his death , when much became clear to me that had not been before , I knew that he was working so hard for me because Days to Come had scared me and scared him for my future . If that is true there is a chance I have made the dependency greater than it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a strange time of our years together . I do n't know if I was paying him back for his casual ladies of our early years  --  it takes a jealousnature a long time to understand that there can be casual ladies  --  but certainly I was serious or semiseriousabout another man and iiamule ' t knew it . Nei-170Theatrether of us ever talked about it until I told Dash that I had decided not to marry the man . He looked at me in surprise . " Marry ? You decided ? There was never a chance you 'd marry him . " " It was about to happen , " I said . " We had set the day and the place . I thought you knew that . " " I would never have allowed that . Never . " I laughed and he knew why I laughed because a few days later he said , " It was no good . It would never have been any good . The day it is good for you , I 'll allow it . " " Thank you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't ask your permission and therefore wo n't thank you for giving it . " " Without my permission you wo n't ever do it . And you ought to know that by now . " For years after I would say such things as , " May I have your permission this morning to go to the hairdresser , then to the library and on my way home buy an ice cream cone ? " But he was not a vain man and , as time moved on , I knew he had been right . The Little Foxes was the most difficult play I ever wrote . I was clumsy in the first drafts , putting in and taking out characters , ornamenting , decorating , growingmore and more weary as the versions of scenes and then acts and then three whole plays had to be thrown away . Some of the trouble came because the play has a distant connection to my mother 's family and every-171Pentimentothing that I had heard or seen or imagined had formed a giant tangled time-jungle in which I could find no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old voices speak about histories made long before my day . In the first three versions of the play , because it had been true in life , Horace Giddens had syphilis . When Regina , his wife , who had long refused him her bed , found out about it she put fresh paint on a miserable building that had once been used as slave quarters and kept him there for the rest of his life because , she said , he might infect his children . I had been told that the real Regina would speak with outrage of her betrayalby a man she had never liked and then would burst out laughing at what she said . On the day he died , she dropped the moral complaints forever and went horseback riding during his funeral . All that seemed fine for the play . But it was n't : life had been too big , too muddled for writing . So the syphilis becameheart trouble . I cut out the slave cabin and the long explanations of Regina and Horace 's early life together . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nod of approval and said he thought maybe everything would be O.K. if only I 'd cut out the " blackamoor chitchat . " Even then I knew that the toughness of his criticism , the coldness of his praise , gave him a certain pleasure . But even then I , who am not a good-tempered woman , admired his refusal with172Theatreme , or with anybody else , to decorate or apologize or placate . It came from the most carefully guarded hon- estyI have ever known , as if one lie would muck up his world . If the honesty was mixed with harshness , I did n't much care , it did n't seem to me my business . The desire to take an occasional swipe is there in most of us , but most of us have no reason for it , it is as aimless as the pleasure of a piece of candy . When it is controlled by sense and balance , it is still not pretty , but it is not dangerous and often it is use- ful . It was useful to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was difficult : we offered it to Ina Claire and to Judith Anderson . Each had a pleasant reason for refusing : each meant that the part was unsympathetic , a popular fear for actresses be- fore that concept became outmoded . Herman Shumlin asked me what I thought of Tallulah Bankhead , but I had never seen her here or in her famous English days . She had returned to New York by 1939 , had done a couple of flops , and was married to a nice , silly-handsome actor called John Emery . She was living in the same hotel I was , but I had fallen asleep by the time Herman rang my bell after six hours spent upstairs with Tallulah on their first meeting . He said he had a headache , was worn out by Miss Bankhead 's vitality , but he thought she would do fine for us if he could , in the future , avoid the kind of scene he had just come from : she had been " wild " about the play , wild enough to insist the consultation take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bottle . Shumlin173Pentimentosaid he did n't think Emery liked that much , but he was certain that poor Emery was unprepared for Tallulah 's saying to Herman as he rose to go , " Wait a minute , darling , just wait a minute . I have something to show you . " She threw aside the sheets , pointed down at the naked , miserable Emery and said , " Just tell me , darling , if you 've ever seen a prick that big . " I do n't know what Herman said , but it must have been pleasant because there was no fight that night , nothing to predict what was to come . I still have a diary entry , written a few days later , asking myself whether talk about the size of the male organ is n't a homosexual preoccupation : if things are n't too bad in other ways I doubt if any woman cares very much . Almost certainly Tallulah did n't care about the size or the function : it was the stylish , epater palaver of her day . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with their brightest hour : what worked once must always work . Tallulah had been the nineteentwenties ' most daring girl , but what had been dashing , even brave , had become by 1939 shrill and tiring . The life of the special darlings in the world of art and society had been made old-fashioned by the economicmiseries of those who had never been darlings . Nothing is displaced on a single day and much was left over during the Depression , but the train had made a sharp historical swing and the fashionable folk , their life and customs , had become loud and tacky. 174TheatreTallulah , in the first months of the play , gave a fine performance , had a well-deserved triumph . It was sad to watch it all decline into high-jinks on the stage and in life . Long before her death , beginning with my play , I think , she threw the talent around to amuse the campy boys who came each opening night to watch her vindicate their view of women . I did n't clearly understand all that when I first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably not more than five years ' difference in our ages , and a bond in our Southernbackground  --  her family came from an Alabama town close to my mother 's  --  we were a generation apart . I first realized it when we were still in rehearsal , about a week before the play was to open in Baltimore . Tallulah , Herman and I were having dinner in the old Artists and Writers Club , a hangout for newspapermen . Tallulah took two small bottles from her pocketbook , put them on the table , and seemed to forget about them . As we were about to go back to rehearsal , she picked up one bottle and tipped it to put drops in her eyes . She rose from the table , repacked the bottles , led the way to the door , and let out a shriek that brought the restaurant to its feet . Herman rushed to her , she pushed him aside , other people pushed toward her , she turned for the door , changed her mind , and whispered to nobody , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Herman ran to a phone booth , she shouted after him , he called out that he was getting a doctor , she said he was to mind his business , and175Pentimentosuddenly , in the shouting and running , she grabbed my arm , pulled me into the toilet and said , " Get Hermanoff that phone . I put the cocaine in my eyes and I do n't tell that to doctors or to anybody else . Tell him to shut up about it or I wo n't go back to the theatre . " She sat down at a table , grinned at everybody , and ordered herself a shot of whiskey . I squeezed my way into the phone booth , told Herman about the cocaine . He moved slowly toward her and said , " Put down the whiskey and come outside . " On the sidewalk he said , " I do n't like what just happened . This play is going to open on time and I want you to cut the nonsense . " Tallulah said , in controlled stage-anger , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damn business what I do . I warn you never to talk to me this way again . " As she hailed a taxi , Herman said , " If you do n't come back to rehearsals in half an hour , do n't come back at all . " She slammed the door of the taxi , he and I walked back to the theatre , and ten minutes later Tallulah appeared on the stage . Cocaine was not mentioned again until the opening night party she gave in her Baltimore hotel rooms . It was , indeed , quite a night . Her father , the Speaker of the House of Representatives , and her uncle , the Senator , had come down from Washington . Hammett had arrived a few days before , then Dorothy Parker and her husband Alan Campbell , with Sara and Gerald Murphy . We were a mixed bag , the cast and guests , trying to circulate in a room too small for us. 176TheatreWith time and booze things got loud and the Senator took to singing " Dixie , " spirituals , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Murphy said to him , " Lovely . But now you must rest your fine vocal cords . " Tallulah was sitting in a large group giving the monologue she always thought was conversation . I was tired , waiting to go to my room , and I guess I yawned once too often because she began to tease me , in the kind of nagging fashion she used when she knew somebody wanted to leave her . A young Negro waiter moved back and forth , passing drinks , and as he came near us she asked him if he wanted to sleep with her or me . He stood still , frightened . She pulled him toward her and kissed him . I said to the waiter , " Better get out of here now . She 's probably not up to much , but this is Maryland . " He went rapidly toward the door , Tallulah went after him , offering to hit me along the way , and Hammettmoved behind her . When things had settled down , she put her arms around Hammett and promised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a handsome man . He thanked her and said he did n't much like to be around people who took dope , in his Pinkerton days he had been more afraid of them than of murderers . They talked that over for a while but I lost track until I heard her shout at him , " You do n't know what you are talking about . I tell you cocaine is n't habit-forming and I know because I 've been taking it for years . " When I laughed too long she got upset with me177Pentimentoagain and Gerald Murphy said he thought I 'd be safer in bed . Unfortunately my bedroom was next door and I lay sleepless until five in the morning . Then I fell asleep to be awakened by a fight that was going on behind my bed . Tallulah and a woman I had met at the party  --  an assistant or an ex-secretary were arguing about an income tax claim and what the woman had done with Tallulah 's money . ( I think that several years later there was a lawsuit between them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sleep . Insults came back and then a demand to join them for a drink . When I said I did n't want a drink and why did n't they go knock each other off the hotel roof , one of them began to pound on my door with what sounded like a bottle and , in time , the pounding became , with giggles , the rhythm of " America the Beautiful . " I got dressed and decided to go sit in the park , but before I left the room I broke a desk chair against their door . Tallulah sent commands the next day for me to appearat rehearsals and apologize , but I was with Dottie , Alan and the Murphys in the hotel dining room from ten in the morning until they closed the place at midnight . It was one of the most pleasant days of my life . I was sleepy and content : the play had gotten fine reviews , we all had a lot to drink , and nobody talked about the play or the theatre . I remember dozing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gerald say , " It 's not an easy business , the theatre , " and Dottie 's saying , " billy does things the hard way . Why didn't178Theatreshe have sense enough to get Harpo Marx instead of Tallulah ? " and then a long discussion about General Sherman , who was Sara Murphy 's grandfather . There are not many good critics for any art , but there have been almost none for the modern theatre . The intellectuals among them know little about an operating theatre and the middlebrows look at plays as if they were at a race track for the morning lineup . It is a mixed-up picture in many ways . One critic who wrote that The Little Foxes was a febrile play later called it an American classic without explainingwhy he changed his mind . The New York Times , for many years , has been the only newspaper that mattered to the success of a play . That is not the fault of the paper , but it is not a good state for a struggling art form . Now , with Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : a good review by him no longer makes a hit , but a bad review does damage . The Times has had a long list of earnest , honest , undistinguished critics . Walter Kerr is the only one , I think , who learned and thrived . Mr. Barnes is the first fashion-swinger in the list but , like most , he ca n't quite find where the swing is located for the new season . I knew many of the virtues and the mistakes of The Little Foxes before the play opened . I wanted , I needed an interesting critical mind to tell what I had done beyond the Iiinited amount I could see for myself . But the high praise and the reservations seemed179Pentimentoto me stale stuff and I think were one of the reasons the great success of the play sent me into a wasteful , ridiculous depression . I sat drinking for months after the play opened trying to figure out what I had wanted to say and why some of it got lost . I grew restless , sickish , digging around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the play . I had meant to half-mock my own youthful high-class innocence in Alexandra , the young girl in the play ; I had meant people to smile at , and to sympathize with , the sad , weak Birdie , certainlyI had not meant them to cry ; I had meant the audience to recognize some part of themselves in the money-dominated Hubbards ; I had not meant people to think of them as villains to whom they had no connection . I belonged , on my mother 's side , to a banking , store keeping family from Alabama and Sunday dinnerswere large , with four sisters and three brothers of my grandmother 's generation , their children , and a few cousins of my age . These dinners were long , with high-spirited talk and laughter from the older people of who did what to whom , what good nigger had consented to thirty percent interest on his cotton crop and what bad nigger had made a timid protest , what new white partner had been outwitted , what benefits the year had brought from the Southern business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had had sense enough to move toward . When I was fourteen , in one of my many **26;473;TOOLONG , I yelled across that Sunday 's dinner table at a great-aunt , " You have a spatulate face made to dig in the mud for money . May God forgive you . " My aunt rose , came around the table and slapped me with her napkin . I said , " Someday I 'll pay you back unless the dear God helps me conquer the evil spirit of revenge , " and ran from the room as my gentle mother started to cry . But later that night , she knocked on my locked door and said that if I came out I could have a squab for dinner . My father was out of New York but , evidently informed of the drama by my mother , wrote to me saying that he hoped I had sense enough not to revenge myself until I was as tall and as heavy as my great-aunt . But a few years after I had stopped being pleased with the word spatulate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explanation : I began to think that greed and the cheating that is its usual companion were comic as well as evil and I began to like the family dinners with the talk of who did what to whom . I particularly looked forward to the biannual dinner when the sisters and brothers assembled to draw lots for " the diamond " that had been left , almost thirty years before , in my great-grandmother 's estate . Sometimesthey would use the length of a strip of paper to designate the winner , sometimes the flip of a coin , and once I was allowed to choose a number up to eight and the correct guesser was to get the diamond . But nobody , as far as 1 knew , ever did get it . No sooner was Ow winner declared than one or the other would sulk181Pentimentoand , by prearrangement , another loser would console the sulker , and a third would start the real event of the afternoon : an open charge of cheating . The paper , the coin , my number , all had been fixed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Funnier because my mother 's generation would sit white-faced , sometimes tearful , appalled at what was happening , all of them envying the vigor of their parents , half knowing that they were broken spirits who wished the world was nicer , but who were still so anxious to inherit the money that they made no protest . I was about eighteen when my great-uncle Jake took the dinner hours to describe how he and a new partner had bought a street of slum houses in downtown New York . He , Jake , during a lunch break in the signing of the partnership , removed all the toilet seats from the buildings and sold them for fifty dollars . But , asked my mother 's cousin , what will the poor people who live there do without toilet seats ? " Let us , " said Jake , " approach your question in a practical manner . I ask you to accompany me now to the bathroom , where I will explode my bowels in the manner of the impoverished and you will see for yourself how it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lead her to the exhibition , my constantly ailing cousin began to cry in high , long sounds . Her mother said to her , " Go along immediately with your Uncle Jake . You are being disrespectful to him . " I guess all that was the angry comedy I wanted to mix with the drama. 182TheatreAngry comedy came another way . I was to get my first taste during The Little Foxes of the redbaitingthat later turned my life into disorder and financial disaster . The Spanish Civil War  --  I had been in Spain during the war  --  had reached the sad day of Franco 's victory and many Republicans were trapped on what was known as the International Bridge . Some of them were my friends , some of them I only knew about . Their lives were at stake . Many of us sent all the money we could give or collect and looked around to find other money fast . Herman Shumlin and I decided to ask the cast of The Little Foxes if they would do a benefit for the Spanish refugees . Tallulah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within their rights when they refused , and nothing more was said about benefits until the week after Russia moved into Finland . I had been in Helsinki in 1937 for two weeks and had turned my head each day from the giant posters of Hitler pasted to the side wall of my hotel . One night a member of our Olympic team , a man of Finnish descent , had taken me to a large rally of Hitler sympathizersand translated for me their admiring speeches . I needed no translator for the raised arms , the cheers , the Wessel song . Finland 's ambassador to Washington was a handsome and charming man who met Tallulah at a dinner party . The clay following Tallulah 's meeting with the , rrtrhassador she announced that The Little Foxes183Pentimentowould give a benefit for the Finnish refugees . The day following that Shumlin and I announced that The Little Foxes would not give a benefit . I ca n't remembernow whether we explained that we had been refuseda benefit for Spain , but I do remember that suddenly what had been no more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was made to seem that we agreed with the invasion of Finland , refused aid to true democrats , were , ourselves , dangerous Communists . It was my first experience of such goings-on and I did n't have sense enough to know that Tallulah 's press statements , so much better than ours , or more in tune with the times , were being guided by the expert ambassador . Although her anger she often had the righteousness that belongs to a certain kind of aging sinner  --  once aroused needed no guidanceand stood up well against all reason . And nobody has ever been able to control me when I feel that I have been treated unjustly . I am , in fact , bewildered by all injustice , at first certain that it can not be , then shocked into rigidity , then obsessed , and finally as certain as a Grand Inquisitor that God wishes me to move ahead , correct and holy . Through those days Tallulah and I were , indeed , a pair . And so we never spoke again for almost thirty years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself say , " Maybe it 's time we said hello . " The face that looked up from years of physical and spiritual beatingswas blank . I said , " I 'm Lillian Hellman , " and Tallulah flew toward me in a scream of **31;501;TOOLONG and a holiday of kisses . I was pleased for the first half-hour . But reconciliations can be as noisy as the fights that caused them . Only two diaries written at the end of 1938 could convince me now that Watch on the Rhine came out of Henry James , although , of course , seeds in the wind , the long journey they make , their crosses and mutations , is not a new story for writers and even make you hope that your seeds may scatter for those to come . I was driving back to the farm trying not to listen to the noise that came from two crates of Pekin ducks when I began to think of James 's The American and The Europeans . In the short time since James , the United States had become the dominant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imposing on other people a morality which was designed in part to hide its self-interest . Was that a new American game or had we learned it from the English who invented it to hold down their lower classes ? We still spoke as nineteenth-century Cromwellians in church , home , and university , but increasingly , the more we recognizeddisorder and corruption at home the more insistentwe grew about national purity . Many Europeans had moved here with the triumph of Hitler in the 1930 's . Few of us asked questions about their past or present convictions because we took for granted that they had left either in fear of persecution or to make a brave protest . They were our kind of folks . It took me a long time to find out that185Pentimentomany of them had strange histories and that their hosts , or the people who vouched for them , knew all about their past . Two of the perhaps eight or nine that I met turned out to have unexpected reasons for emigration : both had been Nazi sympathizers ; in one case , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounds the " new barbarians " made about modern painting ; in the other , bribe money had not been able to suppress a nineteenth-century conversion from Judaism to Luther . I was vaguely related to that family , and when I asked about the truth of the rumor , the son of the family never spoke to me again . But a few weeks later I had a note from his mother saying that she was surprised to find that certain Jews in America claimed a blood connection to her family , when , in fact , they had " no legal or moral right " to do so . I had no right , from my safe place , to feel bitter about such people , but I did and , of course , by 1938 I had been through the life and death of my friend Julia , and had been to Spain during the Civil War , and had been moved by men willing to die for what they believed in . I wanted to write a play about nice , liberal Americanswhose lives would be shaken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had won because the old values had long been dead . I put the play in a small Ohio town . That did n't work at all . Then one night , coming out of a long dream about the streets of London , I knew that I had stubbornly returned to the peo-186Theatreple and the place of Days to Come . I was obsessed with my dream , stopped writing for a month or so , and only started again when I found the root of the dream ; then I moved the play to Washington , placed it in the house of a rich , liberal family who were about to meet their anti-fascist son-in-law , a German , who had fought in Spain . He was , of course , a form of Julia . The dream had taken me back to an evening in 1936 when , on a visit to London , I had a phone call from the famous Margot Asquith . I had never met Lady Asquith , but I remembered Dorothy Parker writing of her Autobiography , " The affair between Margot Asquith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love stories in all literature . " Lady Asquith told me that the novelist Charles Morgan wanted to meet me , would I come to dinner ? It was a strange evening : from the minute the butler opened the Baker Street door and said , " Oh , you 're bloody young , " I felt as if I had gone swimming in strong waters and would have to struggle hard to reach land again . The dinner party was Lady Asquith , her son Anthony , a movie director , her daughter Elizabeth , Princess Bibesco , and the Romanian Prince Antoine Bibesco , her husband . Princess Bibesco had written a number of books and I would have liked to talk to her , being at that point in my life most respectful of lady-hooks that carried delicate overtones of sadness . There was no Charles Morgan and I'ady Asquith **25;534;TOOLONG that I thought there would be , but halfway through the dinner a very tall young man sat down next to me and , although I never heard his name through the marshmallow English syllables , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was most pleasant , but his mother frowned at me down the table as if she did n't understand why I was there and , as far as I remember , Prince Bibesco said no word . The butlers were plentiful , the conversation so faltering that one had the impression that everybody was ill , and when Bibesco rose , pushed aside his plate , said he 'd meet us upstairs , I thought only that he was a sensible man to refuse the bad food . When we left the savories that upper-class Englishhabit of drowning the bad with the worse  --  we joined the prince in a small room off the drawing room . It was filled by a large poker table , the chips already racked , and Bibesco did n't look up from his game of solitaire . Lady Asquith said she was due at a Parliamentary committee , called me Mrs. Dillman as she said goodbye , and left the rest of us to watch the prince play solitaire . When his third game came out fine , he patted me on the arm and asked if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ; he said he did , too , but did n't play much anymore and was out of practice . The semiroyal gentleman coughed , but I thought that was because a Mr. and Mrs. Something-or-Other came into the room . In a few minutes we were alI in a poker game . Eliz-188abeth Bibesco did n't play but sat reading in a room off our room . In the first half-hour of the game her husband made jokes about how you cut cards , in what direction you started dealing , did a straight come before a full house , and by midnight I had lost almost three hundred pounds and semiroyalty had lost over five hundred pounds . I have no memory of what happened to the two strangers : I think they lost or won very little , although the man sneezed a lot through the evening . By the time I decided that my losses were far more than I could afford , I had learned that Bibesco had been the Romanian ambassador to Washington and a regular at the games of Vice-President Charles Curtis , a famous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it was not my literary reputationthat had gone ahead of me , but a piece in the New York Herald Tribune saying that the boys in the famous New York Thanatopsis poker game had thought of inviting me to join them , but finally decideda woman would set a bad precedent . This was verified by the royal cousin , who drove me to my hotel in a high-powered racing car . He was a charmingmixture of glum and glee as he said that he knew he was a bad player , always vowed he 'd never go back to that particular high-stake game , and went back whenever he was asked . I thought about that poker game for years afterward and came to feel that the evening , the dinner , Bibesco , and Lady Asquith herself were characters sitting in a second-act drawing room because the stagehands had forgotten to tell them189Pentimentothat the scenery had changed to the edge of a volcano . It was a pleasant experience , Watch on the Rhine . There are plays that , whatever their worth , come along at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the theatre and the cinema . From the first day of rehearsalthings went well . It was a hardworking cast of nice people , with the exception of Paul Lukas , the best actor among them ; but his capers were open and comic . ( He told me that he had been a trusted followerof the Hungarian Communist Bela Kun , but that the week before Kun fell he had joined Kun 's enemies . He saw nothing contradictory in now playinga self-sacrificing anti-Fascist . ) But not everybody thought Paul was funny . John Lodge , then an actor and later to be our ambassador to Spain  --  when DorothyParker heard about his diplomatic appointment she said , " Lilly , let us , as patriots , join hands and walk into the water "  --  was shocked when Paul cheated him at tennis , and Eric Roberts , who played Paul 's twelve-year-old son , disliked him so much that some nights he ate garlic before he climbed into Paul 's lap and other nights he rubbed his hair with foulsmellingwhale oil . I remember all that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shumlin and I were having our usual fights . The Baltimore opening of Watch on the Rhine went just fine and gave me a chance to see the medical historianDr . Henry Sigerist . Sigerist was one of the heroesof my life : a learned man in medicine who read in many other fields ; a political radical who was an190Theatreexpert cook and on whose judgment professional tea and wine tasters often depended ; a tough man who was gentle ; a sad man who did not complain . And he was a wise political observer : he had left the Universityof Leipzig , guessing two years before Hitler came to power what was to come , and several years before the full flower of Joe McCarthy , during a time when the rest of us thought McCarthy a clown , he resignedfrom Johns Hopkins University and moved back to his native Switzerland . The week before he left America he came to visit us at the Pleasantville farm and cooked a great and complicated meal with our friend Gregory Zilboorg , and all of us were happy with food and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once again after that dinner , in 1953 , when , because he believed that McCarthy might use him against me  --  I had the year before been called before the House Un-American Activities Committee and that year been subpoenaed by a summonsthat was never served by the McCarthy committee  --  if I came to visit him and his wife in Switzerland , we arranged to meet in Milan . It was fine that day in Milan . Henry had gone to school there and now had pleasure in showing it to me . We drove a long way to a monastery that had remarkable early wall paintings and the abbot and two old priests were openly admiring of this Marxist unbeliever ; we drove further to a small castle on a hill where the owner , a young woman , had a Cana-191Pentimentoletto he wanted to see again and they talked together of her grandparents ; we had lunch and dinner in small , fine restaurants where the owners knew Sigerist and one of them asked for his opinion of a new wine and neither would allow him to pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he told me of the difference in the history of the Northern and Southern Catholic Churches ; and when we said goodbye he told me he was ill and that I must come back soon because he would have only a few years more to see his friends . He died on time , as he did everything else . It is the lifelong problem of only children that they doubt all affection that is offered , even that which has been proved , and so , as the years passed , I told myselfthat Sigerist had been polite and kind to me , but that I had not gone back to see him because I was not needed or wanted . I only recognized the vanity behind my lack of vanity when his daughter published a part of his diary in which there is proof of what he felt for me . We all have been spared some nonsense and I have been spared caring very much what most peoplethought about me . But I cared so much for what this distinguished man thought that I cut the words from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the frame in a safe . Yesterday , nineteen years later , standing in a pretty Wellfleet cemetery at Edmund Wilson 's funeral , I thought of Henry Sigerist and knew why . These two men , so different in temperament , in interests , in be-192Theatrelief , one so European , one so American , were alike in the kind of wide-ranging mind rare in a time of specialists , alike in the nineteenth-century conviction that culture was applied curiosity . I remembered once tellingEdmund that I had asked Sigerist if it was true that he knew thirteen languages and he had said , " No , no . I know only nine . I can read in three others but I can not say more than a sentence and that not well . " Edmund had smiled at that , but a few minutes later told me that he was studying Hungarian and I knew my story had started a charming competitiveness in him and a counting on his fingers . Watch on the Rhine is the only play I have ever written that came out in one piece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ altered the trees or the seasons of their colors . All other work for me had been fragmented , hunting in an open field with shot from severalguns , following the course but unable to see clearly , recovering the shot hands full , then hands empty from stumbling and spilling . But here , for the first and last time , the work I did , the actors , the rehearsals , the success of the play , even the troubles that I have forgotten , make a pleasant oneness and have been lost to the past . The real memories of that time are not for the play but for the people who passed through the time of it . President Roosevelt was one of them . In those days it was a yearly custom for a play to be chosen to give a kind of command performance before the President for the benefit of the Infantile Pa-193Pentimentoralysis Fund . When Watch on the Rhine was invited to Washington for a Sunday night early in 1942 , it was the first public appearance of President Rooseveltsince war had been declared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be called up , and a good deal of the train ride from New York to Washington was taken up with the question of what he should wear to the White House for a supperparty after the performance . A Navy uniform seemed premature ; others of us argued that plain dinnerclothes were not quite right for a man of distinguishedfamily about to serve his country , perhaps to die . I suggested a sword and red ribbon as being neithertoo little nor too much , but John , who seemed to like that idea , said it would be impossible because nobodycould find such stuff on a Sunday . While the cast rehearsed light cues and tried the acoustics of the theatre , I talked an idle assistant manager into phoning a friend who worked at a theatrewarehouse and offering him fifty bucks if he could come up with sword and wide ribbon . In a few hours I was backstage ironing the old crushed ribbon and clanking around with the sword . I guess people laughed too much because John , who had seemed most pleased about the idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I felt bad about that , it would have been nice , and only came around to feeling betterwhen Mr. Roosevelt entered the theatre . The bold , handsome head had so much intelligence and confi-104Theatredence that the wheelchair in which he sat seemed not a handicap but an interesting way to move about . At supper Roosevelt remembered that I had once visited him at Warm Springs , coming , by accident , on the same day as Huey Long . We talked about Long and my native Louisiana , but he was more interested  --  he asked me several times  --  in when I had written Watch on the Rhine . When I told him I started it a year and a half before the war , he shook his head and said in that case he did n't understand why Morris Ernst , the lawyer , had told him that I was so opposed to the war that I had paid for the " Communist " war protesters who kept a continuous picket line around the White House before Germany attacked the Soviet Union . I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nonsense story , but Ernst 's family had been in business with my Alabama family long ago and that was n't a good mark on any man . Mr. Roosevelt laughed and said he 'd enjoy passing that message on to Mr. Ernst . But the story about my connection with the picket line was there to stay , often repeated when the redbaitingdays reached hurricane force . But by that time , some of the pleasant memories of Watch on the Rhine had also disappeared : Lukas , once so loud in gratitude for the play , put in his frightened , blunted knife for a newspaper interviewer , and Lucille Watson , a remarkable actress , changed her written affection for me when she came to work in The l atrinrn . Carden. almost ten years later . She **26;561;TOOLONG us then for three days . On the fourth day she did not return . She told another actor that perhaps she could put up with me because I was " a toilet-trained Jew , " but she could n't put up with Harold Clurman , the director , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardest lesson to learn in the theatre is to take nobody too seriously . It is possible that because the war so drastically changed the world , the small , less observed things changed without being recognized . Now , looking back , I think that after Watch on the Rhine much of the pleasant high-jinks of the theatre were never to be seen again because the theatre , like the rest of the country , became expensive , earnest and conservative . The Tallulahsand the Lukases were not easy to take , but they belonged to a time I liked better . Whatever the reason , the theatre pictures behind my eyes for the period after that are fragmented and it would be uselessand untruthful for me to order them up from scrapbooks or other people 's memories . About the plays that followed that period , the pictures are there , but not many are much more than a camera angle that was part of a whole , of course , but is now seen only by itself . Of The Searching Wind I have very little now except the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arriving at seven-thirty each night during the run of the play to meet Montgomery Clift , a gifted , inexperienced young actor in his first large dart . To-/96Theatregether they would sit on the stage until the second curtaincall and go through a scene from Shakespeare or Ibsen or Chekhov , or a series of poems , anything that Digges had chosen to teach Monty . It was mighty nice , the two of them , and I took to going to the theatre several times a week just to stand in the wings and watch the delicate relationship between the dedicated old and the dedicated young . I was never to see much of Clift after the closing of the play , but in the years that followed , mostly unhappy ones for him , I am told , I would often get a long-distance call from him , we would arrange to meet , never manage it , but always we would talk of Dudley Digges , who died a few years after The Searching Wind . I had always planned The Little Foxes as a trilogy , knowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Hubbards and would want to go forward in time . But in 1946 it seemed right to go back to their youth , their father and mother , to the period of the Civil War . I believed that I could now make clear that I had meant the first play as a kind of satire . I tried to do that in Another Part of The Forest , but what I thought funny or outrageous the critics thought straight stuff ; what I thought was bite they thought sad , touching , or plotty and melodramatic . Perhaps , as one critic said , I blow a stage to pieces without knowing it . In any case , I had a good time directing the play , not because I wanted to , but because I was tired of arguments and knew no director I thought was right for me . I d id a good job , I think , so good197Pentimentothat I fooled myself into thinking I was a director , a mistake that I was to discover a few years later . But then and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Patricia Neal , and watched her develop into a good actress and a remarkable woman . With Montserrat , an adaptation I made from the French play by Emmanuel Robles , I not only cast the play with a kind of abandoned belief that good actors can play anything , but I directed it in a fumbling , frightened way , intimidated by Emlyn Williams , the British actor and writer , who was playing the leading part . I do not blame Mr. Williams for his disapproval of me , although the way he showed it had a bad effect on the actors and thus on the play . He must have known from the first days of rehearsal that fear infectsand corrupts what it touches . It is best in the theatre to act with confidence no matter how little right you have to it . It is a special and valuable gift , directing , but it has come to its present power mostly in comedies or musicals . Few dramas can stand up against another assertive talent , even if it is more distinguished than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem : the director and writer are now often the same person , or two people who seen to function as one . But in the theatre , drama , even plain , dull seriousness , is still a business of unsolved delicacy between the writer , the director and the actors. *198TheatreMany writers work best in time of trouble : no money , the cold outside and in , even sickness and the end in view . But I have always known that when trouble comes I must face it fast and move with speed , even though the speed is thoughtless and sometimes damaging . For such impatient people , calm is necessary for hard work long days , months of fiddling is the best way of life . I wrote The Autumn Garden in such a period . I was at a good age ; I lived on a farm that was , finally , running fine and I knew I had found the right place to live for the rest of my life . Hammett and I were both making a lot of money , and not caring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together almost twenty years , some of them bad , a few of them shabby , but now we had both stopped drinking and the early excited years together had settled into a passionate affection so unexpected to both of us that we were as shy and careful with each other as courting children . Without words , we knew that we had survived for the best of all reasons , the pleasure of each other . I could not wait to hear what he thought about the news in the morning paper , about a book , a departing guest , a day 's hunt for birds and rabbits , an hour 's walk in the woods . And nobody in my life has ever been as anxious to have me stay in a room , talk late into the night , get up in the morning . I guess it was the best time for me , certainly the best time of our life together . Now , I think , that somewhere we both knewthe signs were already there , Joe McCarthy was199Pentimentoover the land  --  that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One year later Hammett was in jail ; two years later the place where I intended to live the rest of my life had to be sold ; three or four years later neither of us had any money and , more important than any of that , all of which can be borne without too much trouble , we were to face Hammett 's death around every corner . If we did smell the future , I am glad we had sense enough never to mention it . I have many times written about Dash 's pleasure in The Autumn Garden . Now , this minute , I can hearmyself laugh at the fierce , angry manner in which he spoke his praise , as if he hated the words , was embarrassed by them . He was forever after defensive he had never been about my work or his if anybody had any reservations about the play . A short time after the play opened , I came home very pleased to tell him that Norman Mailer had told me how good he thought the play . Norman had said it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had lost my nerve . Dash said , " Almost everybody loses their nerve . You almost did n't , and that 's what counts , and what he should have said . " By 1955 I needed money . I wish I could tell myselfthat was why I adapted Jean Anouilh 's The Lark . But my reason was not money : I was feeling mischievousand the reasons for the mischief still exist asthey were written on a Ritz Hotel menu in London . My producer , Kermit 131oorngarden , had bought the200Theatreplay and wanted me to make a new adaptation . I flew to London to see Christopher Fry 's version , did n't like it , cabled Kermit that it was n't up my alley . Then I had lunch at the Ritz with Dr. Van Loewen , Anouilh 's agent . I was pleased to meet a doctor-agent having only once before heard of one , Milton Bender , a former dentist , who perhaps had a better right to the title . So I said , " I am sorry , Doctor , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I . . . " The doctor said , " We , Mr. Anouilh and I , have the greatest respect for your gifts , Mrs. Hellman , but L'Alouette comes from the mind of a poet and must , therefore , be adapted by a poet . " " Poet , " I said , " poet ? " " We have the greatest respect for your gifts , Mrs. Hellman , but . . . " " You are right . I am not a poet . " " There , " he said . " You are a lady of honesty for whose gifts we have . . . " " You do n't need a poet . You need George Bernard Shaw , but he 's dead . " The doctor said , " Shaw was not a poet . I do not think he would have been the right adaptor , either . " After I made that note on my menu and thought about foreigners , I said , " Mr. Shaw wrote a fine play about Joan of Arc , without all of Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a poet , " said the doctor . " Perhaps , " I said , " but not in French , " laughed , and felt ashamed of myself. 207PentimentoI do n't remember how long it took Bloomgarden to talk me out of the conversation with the doctor , but by the time I agreed to do the play I was convinced that Joan was history 's first modern career girl , wise , unattractive in what she knew about the handling of men , straight out of a woman 's magazine . The wonderfulstory lay , as Shaw had seen it , in the miraculous self-confidence that carried defeated men into battle against all sense and reason , forced a pious girl into a refusal of her church , caused the terrible death that still has to do with the rest of us , forever , wherever her name is heard . And so for good or bad , I scaled down the play , cut the comparisons to the World War II German invasion of France and the tributes to the French spirit . I had doubts about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anouilh has any truth , he had doubts ; and I did n't like fake doves flying out over the audience to show the soaring spirit of Joan , the victory of idealism , or just to indicate the end of a play . And the fine , straightforward performance of Julie Harris helped make the play the first success Mr. Anouilh had in America , which is possibly why we never again heard from him or from the doctor , although all profits , quite properly , have been accepted by them . Some kind of confidence , even fake , is needed for any work , but it is particularly required in the theatre , where ordinary timidity and stumbling seem **28;589;TOOLONG , and are infectious and corruptive to other frightened people . I think now that I began to leave the theatre with the production of Candide , an operetta with music by Leonard Bernstein , lyrics by Richard Wilbur . ( I was not to leave for another two plays , but I am slow at leaving anything . ) I can account for the deterioration of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know is not good , but any such account would be confused , full of those miserable , small complaints and blames that mean nothing except to the person making them . I was not used to collaboration , I had become , with time , too anxious to stay out of fights , and because I was working with people who knew more about the musical theatre than I did , I took suggestions and made changes that I did n't believe in , tried making them with speed I can not manage . All that , I could and did put aside . The confidence went for another reason : I knew we were in bad trouble the day the cast first read and sang the play . I knew it , I said it , and yet I sat scared , inwardly raging , outwardly petty passive before the great talentsof Leonard Bernstein , who knew about music , and Tyrone Guthrie , the director , who knew about the theatre . The lady producer knew nothing about either . All of it , after the nice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , through rehearsals to the closing night of Candide  --  and again , years later , the 1972 Kennedy Center revival with which I203Pentimentorefused any connection  --  was sad and wasteful and did not need to be . Several months after the play closed in New York , Tony Guthrie said , " Lennie , Wilbur , Oliver Smith , Irene Sharaff , Miss Hellman and Mr. Guthrie were too much talent for a good brew . " That is hard for me to believe . Vanity , which I think is what he meant , can be of great use : it was dangerous during Candide because it was on a blind rampage . I think now that Guthrie was as frightened as I was . I should have recognized that the night of the Boston dress rehearsal when Marc Blitzstein , an old friend of Lennie 's and mine , walked me back to the hotel . We were depressed , neither of us talked the long way across the Boston Common . At the door of my room Marc said , " You 're cooked , kid , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Guthrie . He grinned at me once , his mouth full of sandwich and wine , and said , Well , Marc , that 's that . Lillian is often right , but Lennie is so charming . ' " Guthrie was an imaginative man , bold in a timid business , uncaring about money in a world that cared about little else . It is true that the imagination led to tinkering : he reinterpreted almost every play he directed , but he did it with brilliance . I turn my head now , look out at a jetty in front of my house , and see again this giant-tall man sitting on the end rock , telling me of his childhood , his universitydays , and then , as if he had talked more than he meant , suddenly - itching himself into the water at204Theatrea dangerous angle . In the years after Candide , we sometimes saw each other , more often wrote letters . In one letter , I told him that Candide had done bad things to me , I was n't working . He did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in New York and we met for lunch . As I came in the restaurantdoor , a voice on my right side said , " Stop the nonsense . Get on with new work , get on with it to-day . " It was a valuable accident that a few days after that , or so I thought until a week ago , I spent the evening with Elena and Edmund Wilson . During the evening we talked of a man we both knew and Edmundasked why he did n't write anymore . I mumbled something about writing blocks , I had one myself , all of us , and so on . Edmund said , " Foolishness . A writer writes . That 's all there is to it . " For anybody of my generation , so eager for the neurosis , yours if you could manage it , if desperate somebody else 's , the hardheaded sense of that was good stuff . But it did not happen a few days after I saw Guthrie . Last week I came back from Edmund 's funeral and sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning I went through old diaries of the many times I had spent with the Wilsons and found that " A writer writes . That 's all there is to it , " came almost two years after my lunch with Guthrie . But it is true that the next day after Edmund said it I went to work on Toys in thy , Attic. 205PentimentoMonths before that day , Hammett and I had walked down from the house into the beach grass to look at a quail nest and see how things were going . I had known about the emphysema since Dash got out of the Army in 1945 , known it had grown worse when he went to jail in 951 , knew that we could go less and less to the beach or any place else . But I do n't think I had ever heard the heavy panting breath until that day as we climbed the steps back to the house . He stopped and lowered his head . I held out a hand . He looked away from my hand and said , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man . Other people , people who say they love him , want him to make good , be rich . So he does it for them and finds they do n't like him that way , so he fucks it up , and comes out worse than before . Think about it . " I wrote an act and a half and gave it to Hammett to read . When he had finished with it , he said , " Take the boat and go fishing . Forget the play for today . Maybe by night I 'll . . . " " No , " I said . " This time you do n't have to tell me what 's wrong . I can write about men , but I ca n't write a play that centers on a man . I 've got to tear it up , make it about the women around him , his sisters , his bride , her mother and  --  " Well , " he said , " then my idea 's out the window . Never mind . I 'll use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . But he lived long enough to have great pleasure from the play , and the last trip he ever made was to Boston for the opening . We had fun together , very like the old , first days of jokes , and20 ( Theatrewanting to be together , resenting the times we were n't . I skipped rehearsals for a couple of days and we went once more to see Paul Revere 's house , Faneuil Hall , the Old South Meeting House , drove out to the Old Manse in Concord and had an argument about Emerson as if we had never had it before . I realized that in the pleasure of those days I had forgotten how sick he was and was worried that he would pay for the tramping about . But for the first time in years he seemed better for it , and we had late , cheerfuldinners in our rooms . I said , " The Ritz Hotel has the best thermoses . I wish I could just up and take one home . " " For years you 've thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , washrags , shoeshinecloths , soap , and then patting yourself on the back for the nerve of doing it . Take the thermos . You 'll feel better . " " I ca n't . And you 've never stolen anything . " " I never wanted anything enough . " " That is n't the reason . You think it is n't dignified . " The next day , coming back from a shopping trip with Maureen Stapleton during which I persuaded her into two expensive dresses and an alligator bag about which to this day , whenever there is too much of what she calls wine , she says I bankrupted her forever , Hammett was waiting for me with his suitcasepacked . I said , " You did n't tell me you were leaving today .  --  I le said , " Hid we ever tell each other ? " 207Pentimento ( This morning , twelve years later , I poured myself a cup of coffee from a Ritz Hotel thermos bottle . Dash had put it on top of his clothes , sent for a bellboyto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bellboy showed no sign of seeing the thermos . No , I told myself this morning , we had never told each other , never made a plan , and yet we had moved a number of times from West Coast to East Coast , bought and sold three houses , been well-heeled and broke , parted , come together , and never had plans or even words for the future . In my case , I think , the mixture of commitment with no-commitment came from Bohemia as it bumped into Calvin : in Hammett'sit came from never believing in any kind of permanence and a mind that rejected absolutes . ) Toys in the Attic , with a splendid cast , was a success . The money came at the right time , because for a year I had known that death was on Hammett 's face and I had worried about how we could manage what I thought would be the long last days . It had been my habit to set the alarm clock for every two hours of the night : I would stumble down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could sleep so little as he panted to breathe . Now it was possible to have a nurse and I looked forward to a whole night 's sleep . But it did n't work that way : I did n't like a stranger in his room , I did n't want the night 's sleep . In 1962 I began an adaptation of Bert BBlechman 's novel IioU ) Much . The play was called My Mother , 20RTheatreMy Father and Me and , by the time I finished , was half Blechman , half me . I thought , I think now , that it is a funny play , but we did not produce it well and it was not well directed . More important , I found that I had made some of the same mistakes I had made with Candide : I changed the tone midway from farce to drama and that , for reasons I still do not understand , can not be done in the theatre . The play waited in Boston for the New York newspaperstrike to end . Once again I sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not believe in , this time under the pressure of how much money was about to go down the drain . The playwright is almost always held accountable for failure and that is almost always a just verdict . But this time I told myself that justice does n't have much to do with writing and that I did n't want to feel that way again . For most people in the theatre whateverhappens is worth it for the fun , the excitement , the possible rewards . It was once that way for me and maybe it will be again . But I do n't think so. 2 ( 1 ' 1ARTHUR W. A. COWANTHEODORE ROETHKE andI stood in the back ofthe auditorium until the poet Babette Deutsch finishedreading . I am a noisy audience in a theatre , moving my body and feet without knowing it , crackingthe knuckles of my hands , coughing . But I had been quiet that night because Ted had been tap- ( lancing in the back aisle to music only he could hear and several people in the last row had objected . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember came onstage and said things I wanted to hear but could n't because Ted said , very loudly , " I have just made up a poem . It begins Is n't it thrilling . ' Now you write the next line . Go on , write the next line . " I smiled because that 's usually safe with drunks , but it did n't work . " You do n't want to write a poem with me . T don't213Pentimentothink you want to write a poem at all . O.K. We 'll write a play together , just the two of us . What you say to that ? " He said it again and poked me in the ribs . " Sure , Ted . A play , " and hoped he would n't poke me again . " You say sure , anything , sure , because no matter how much work I do on our play people will think you wrote it and I wo n't get any credit . So we 'll sign an agreement to have one name for both of us . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Let 's go sit down . My feet hurt . " " Not until we find a name . I know , I know , I 've got it . We 'll sign it with the salmon . How about Irving K. Salmon ? I like that , Irving K. Salmon , a good name . " All through dinner there had been talk of a salmon but I did n't know if he was talking about a particular salmon or all salmon because sometimes he talked about their spawning habits , sometimes he talked of one or two or eight fishing trips he had made , and once he told me about a nun he knew in Seattle who had caught a giant fish and given it to him . Then another man came onstage , Roethke gave a whoop , pulled me by the hand and dragged me down the aisle . " Now stop talking about our play . That can wait . I want to hear Cal . " We started into aisles that were already filled , backed out , crossed a number of annoyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had the full attention214Arthur W. A. Cowanof our side of the house . Robert Lowell had started to read in a rather low voice by the time we finally sat down and I wondered how he would make out if Ted kept on talking . But he did n't . He sat hunched forward , moving his lips to the poems , smiling , applaudingoccasionally at the end of a line . After a long silence he said in a new , piping , child 's voice that carried through our section , " The kid 's good . " I am sure the kid was good but I had n't been listening : I was tired after hours of being moved around New York , the pounding , often incoherent talk , the energy that had made us sprint into the zoo , running from monkey house to bird house , and then amble through lunch only to sprint again to visit a friend of Ted 's who turned out to have moved from New York two years before . When the Lowell reading was over , Ted made for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think . But I decided not to follow him and walked slowly home , not expecting to see him again until the next time he came East . In front of my house were Lowell , Ted , Babette , and three other people . Ted lifted me from the ground and said , " I told ' em you 'd be right along after you had finished your secret pint . " To this day I do not know who two of the strangers were , but I came to know the third and he is the reason for my writing now about that night . I came to know his face as well as my own , but I have no memory of it that first time , nor did I then know his name. 215PentimentoI remember only that I found myself yawning into the face of a man sitting near me , yawned in another direction , and a few minutes later became conscious that the man had been staring at me for a long time , not with a flirting look , but as if he were trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you keep your books ? " " Upstairs . There is a kind of library . " " Thank you , " he said , " I am glad to know that . " And then I was too tired to care that neither of us said anything else . A little while later everybody went home except Ted , who was weaving back and forth in a kind of shuffle , his lips forming words I could n't hear . I said , " Ted , I 'm sleepy . " He said , " Ssh . I 've got it . I 've got it . The best poem written in our time . Now listen carefully : Is n't it thrilling there 's another Trilling ? ' Got it ? Is n't it thrilling there 's another Trilling ? ' Got it ? Is n't it thrilling there 's another Trilling ? ' " The second time he poked me in the ribs with his pleasure in creation I said , sure , the poem was fine , but why did n't he go home . He gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his side of the couch and went to sleep immediately . I got from under his dangerousweight without waking him , but the next morning when I came down for breakfast he was gone . There was a note on the table : " I tell you it is thrilling , the Trilling . And just you remember about Irving K. Salrnon. " 216Arthur W. A. CowanI do n't know how I came to mix up the salmon with the flowers , but four or five days later , Helen , a black woman who had worked for me for many years , suddenly appeared in the reading room of the Society Library . When something important had happened , or she was disturbed , she made military gestures . Now she hit me on the shoulder , made a sign meaning I should follow her , and while we walked the few blocks to our house she said , " Mary is down with it again . This time she got her good reasons . " Mary and her husband Ed had been the janitors of the house for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , feckless , kind , and often drunk , at which time they scattered into excitable pieces over nothing more than the mail being late or a light bulb wearing out . " What 's the matter this time ? " " I tell you this time she got her good reasons . A child 's coffin . A child 's coffin has come to the house . " " A child 's coffin ? " " In a pine box . Dripping . " Indeed there was a pine box in the hall , it was the size of a small child , it was dripping , and most of the red lettering of the sender had been washed away . One could still read , " Mother Joa " and numbers that still had two eights in them . Mary and Ed were too upset for me to know or care whether they had been drinking , but when I said , " It smells of fish , " Mary shrieked , went out into the street and was followed by Ed , who took her arm and led her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bar. 217Pentimento I I Arthur W. A. CowanHelen went to get the handyman from the apartment house next door and when he pried off the lid there was a large salmon lying on what had been a bed of ice . The fish was turning , not enough to make us sick , but enough to make us carry it out to the street and close it up again . In time , it turned out that Roethke had sent the salmon , and we exchanged a number of letters about it , although it was never clear about " Mother Joa  --  " A further mix-up came about because while we were opening the salmon box a large basket of flowers arrived , Helen put them on the floor , and somehow they got thrown out in the salmon excitement . I do n't know why I thought Roethke had sent the flowers , but I thanked him , and long after I knew he had not sent them , he wrote that they came as a tribute because 1 liked his greenhouse poems . A few weeks later another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the lady florist who wanted to know if I had received a basket sent a few weeks before , and a second card on which was printed " Arthur W. A. Cowan , Esquire " and then a designation I have long forgotten that meant he had something to do with the State of Pennsylvania . I did not recognize the name Cowan , had never before known an Esquire , wondered when you were entitled to use it . Later that day I tried to phone the lady florist to find out about Esquire , but the phone was busy and I forgot about the whole thing until a third , even fancier arrangement arrived , with the same cardand a scribbled sentence that thanked me for a nice evening . I do n't know when or how I connected the name with the man who had asked me about the books . It may have been because Lowell told me that he had never met Cowan before the night of the poetry readingbut that he knew his name because Cowan had been a large financial contributor to Poetry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I first came to have dinner together , and then to have another , and then to find ourselves good friends . It is hard , indeed , to construct any history of Arthur , in part because he traveled so much , but mostly because he talked of his own past and present in so disjointed a fashion , often taking for granted that you knew what you could not have known , certain that you were pretending ignorance only to annoy him . He is the only person I have ever known who had no sense of time : he did not know whether he had met people last week or many years before , and once he told me he had been divorced for three years when , in fact , he had been divorced for fourteen . And so , in the first few months I knew him , I could follow very little of the mishmash of what he said , and knew only that he had gone to Harvard Law School , moved on to the Philippines , been poor and grown rich , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of brothers and sisters , three houses , and expensive motor cars which he was constantly exchanging to buy others . II is no sense of time was tied up with no sense of218 ' **25;619;TOOLONG was asleep , in that fitful state before waking when dreams rapidly change and there are moments of bleary semiconsciousness . The first ring of the phone was assimilatedinto his dream  --  a vision that he was back in high school groping a girl on a stairwell . The second ring snapped the vision . He rolled over and picked up the receiver . " Yeah ? " " Chief , this is Hendricks . I hate to bother you this early , but  --  " " What time is it ? " " Five-twenty . " " Leonard , this better be good . " " I think we 've got a floater on our hands , Chief . " " A floater ? What in Christ 's name is a floater ? " It was a word Hendricks had picked up from his night reading . " A drowning , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Foote . " I did n't know if you 'd want to check it out before people start swimming . I mean , it looks like it 's going to be a nice day . " Brody heaved an exaggerated sigh . " Where 's Kimble ? " he said and then added quickly , " Oh , never mind . It was a stupid question . One of these days I 'm going to fix that radio of his so he ca n't turn it off . " Hendricks waited a moment , then said , " Like I said , Chief , I hate to bother ... " " Yeah , I know , Leonard . You were right to call . As long as I 'm awake , I might as well get up . I 'll shave and shower and grab some coffee , and on my way in I 'll take a look along the beach in front of Old Mill and Scotch , just to make sure your floater ' is n't cluttering up somebody 's beach . Then when the day boys come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the girl 's date . I 'll see you later . " Brody hung up the phone and stretched . He looked at hisp21wife , lying next to him in the double bed . She had stirred when the phone rang , but as soon as she determined that there was no emergency , she lapsed back into sleep . Ellen Brody was thirty-six , five years younger than her husband , and the fact that she looked barely thirty was a source of both pride and annoyance to Brody : pride because , since she looked handsome and young and was married to him , she made him seem a man of excellent taste and substantialattraction ; annoyance because she had been able to keep her good looks despite the strains of bearing three children , whereas Brody  --  though hardly fat at six-foot-one and two hundred pounds  --  was beginning to be concerned about his blood pressure and his thickening middle . Sometimesduring the summer , Brody would catch himself gazing with idle lust at one of the young , long-legged girls who pranced around town  --  their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he never enjoyed the sensation , for it always made him wonder whether Ellen felt the same stirring when she looked at the tanned , slim young men who so perfectly complemented the long-legged girls . And as soon as that thought occurred to him , he felt still worse , for he recognized it as a sign that he was on the unfortunate side of forty and had already lived more than half his life . Summers were bad times for Ellen Brody , for in summer she was tortured by thoughts she did n't want to think  --  thoughts of chances missed and lives that could have been . She saw people she had grown up with : prep school classmatesnow married to bankers and brokers , summering in Amity and wintering in New York , graceful women who stroked tennis balls and enlivened conversations with equal ease , women who ( Ellen was convinced ) joked among themselvesabout Ellen Shepherd marrying that policeman be/cause he got her pregnant in the back seat of his 1948 Ford , which had not been the case . Ellen was twenty-one when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year at Wellesley and was spending the summer in Amity with her parents  --  as she had done for the previous eleven summers , ever since her father 's advertising agency transferred him from Los Angeles to New York . Although , unlike several of her friends , Ellen Shepherd was hardly obsessed by marriage , she assumed that within a year or two after finishing college she would wed someone from approximately her own social and financial station . The thought neither distressed nor delighted her . She enjoyed the modest wealth her father had earned , and she knew her mother did too . But she was not eager to live a life that was a repetition of her parents ' . She was familiar with the petty social problems , and they bored her . She considered herself a simple girl , proud of the fact that in the yearbook for the class of 1958 at Miss Porter 's School she was voted Most Sincere . Her first contact with Brody was professional . She was arrested  --  or , rather , her date was . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by an extremely drunk young man intent on driving very fast down very narrow streets . The car was intercepted and stopped by a policeman who impressedEllen with his youth , his looks , and his civility . After issuing a summons , he confiscated the keys to Ellen 's date 's car and drove them both to their respective homes . The next morning , Ellen was shopping when she found herself next to the police station . As a lark , she walked in and asked the name of the young officer who had been working at about midnight the night before . Then she went home and wrote Brody a thank-you note for being so nice , and he also wrote a note to the chief of police commending youngp23Martin Brody . Brody telephoned to thank her for her thankyounote . When he asked her out to dinner and the movies on his night off , she accepted out of curiosity . She had scarcely ever talked to a policeman , let alone gone out with one . Brody was nervous , but Ellen seemed so genuinely interested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to have a good time . Ellen found him delightful : strong , simple , kind  --  sincere . He had been a policeman for six years . He said his ambition was to be chief of the Amity force , to have sons to take duck-shooting in the fall , to save enough money to take a real vacation every second or third year . They were married that November . Ellen 's parents had wanted her to finish college , and Brody had been willing to wait until the following summer , but Ellen could n't imagine that one more year of college could make any difference in the life she had chosen to lead . There were some awkward moments during the first few years . Ellen 's friends would ask them to dinner or lunch or for a swim , and they would go , but Brody would feel ill at ease and patronized . When they got together with Brody 's friends , Ellen 's past seemed to stifle fun . People behaved as if they were fearful of committing a faux pas . Gradually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they never saw any of Ellen 's old friends any more . Althoughthe shedding of the " summer people " stigma earned her the affection of the year-round residents of Amity , it cost her much that was pleasant and familiar from the first twenty-one years of her life . It was as if she had moved to another country . Until about four years ago , the estrangement had n't botheredher . She was too busy , and too happy , raising children to let her mind linger on alternatives long past . But whenp24her last child started school , she found herself adrift , and she began to dwell on memories of how her mother had lived her life once her children had begun to detach from her : shopping excursions ( fun because there was enough money to buy all but the most outrageously expensive items ) , long lunches with friends , tennis , cocktail parties , weekend trips . What had once seemed shallow and tedious now loomed in memory like paradise . At first she tried to re-establish bonds with friends she had n't seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience had long since vanished . Ellen talked gaily about the community , about local politics , about her job as a volunteerat the Southampton Hospital  --  all subjects about which her old friends , many of whom had been coming to Amity every summer for more than thirty years , knew little and cared less . They talked about New York politics , about art galleries and painters and writers they knew . Most conversationsended with feeble reminiscences and speculations about where old friends were now . Always there were pledges about calling each other and getting together again . Once in a while she would try to make new friends among the summer people she had n't known , but the associations were forced and brief . They might have endured if Ellen had been less self-conscious about her house , about her husband'sjob and how poorly it paid . She made sure that everyone she met knew she had started her Amity life on an entirely different plane . She was aware of what she was doing , and she hated herself for it , because in fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and  --  for most of the year  --  was quite content with her lot . By now , she had largely given up active forays into the summer community , but the resentments and the longings lingered . She was unhappy , and she took out most of her un/happiness on her husband , a fact that both of them understoodbut only he could tolerate . She wished she could go into suspended animation for that quarter of every year . Brody rolled over toward Ellen , raising himself up on one elbow and resting his head on his hand . With his other hand he flicked away a strand of hair that was tickling Ellen 's nose and making it twitch . He still had an erection from the remnants of his last dream , and he debated rousing her for a quick bit of sex . He knew she was a slow waker and her early morning moods were more cantankerous than romantic . Still , it would be fun . There had not been much sex in the Brody household recently . There seldom was , when Ellen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's mouth fell open and she began to snore . Brody felt himself turn off as quickly as if someone had poured ice water on his loins . He got up and went into the bathroom . It was nearly 6:3o when Brody turned onto Old Mill Road . The sun was well up . It had lost its daybreak red and was turning from orange to bright yellow . The sky was cloudless . Theoretically , there was a statutory right-of-way between each house , to permit public access to the beach , which could be privately owned only to the mean-high-water mark . But the rights-of-way between most houses were filled with garages or privet hedges . From the road there was no view of the beach . All Brody could see was the tops of the dunes . So every hundred yards or so he had to stop the squad car and walk up a driveway to reach a point from which he could survey the beach . There was no sign of a body . All he saw on the broad , white expanse was a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a yard-wide belt of seaweed and kelp pushed ashore by the southerly breeze . There was practically no surf , so if a body was floating on the surface it would have been visible . If there is a floater out there , Brody thought , it 's floating beneath the surface and I 'll never see it till it washes up . By seven o'clock Brody had covered the whole beach along Old Mill and Scotch roads . The only thing he had seen that struck him as even remotely odd was a paper plate on which sat three scalloped orange rinds  --  a sign that the summer 's beach picnics were going to be more elegant than ever . He drove back along Scotch Road , turned north toward town on Bayberry Lane , and arrived at the station house at 7:10 . Hendricks was finishing up his paper work when Brody walked in , and he looked disappointed that Brody was n't dragging a corpse behind him . " No luck , Chief ? " he said . " That depends on what you mean by luck , Leonard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I did n't is n't it too bad , the answer to both questions is no . Is Kimble in yet ? " No . ' Well , I hope he is n't asleep . That 'd look just dandy , having him snoring away in a cop car when people start to do their shopping . " " He 'll be here by eight , " said Hendricks . " He always is . " Brody poured himself a cup of coffee , walked into his office , and began to flip through the morning papers  --  the early edition of the New York Daily News and the local paper , the Amity Leader , which came out weekly in the winter and daily in the summer . Kimble arrived a little before eight , looking , aptly enough , as if he had been sleeping in his uniform , and he had a cup of coffee with Hendricks while they waited for the day shiftp27to appear . Hendricks ' replacement came in at eight sharp , and Hendricks was putting on his leather flight jacket and getting ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm going out to see Foote , Leonard , " Brody said . " You want to come along ? You do n't have to , but I thought you might want to follow up on your ... floater . " Brody smiled . " Sure , I guess so , " said Hendricks . " I got nothing else going today , so I can sleep all afternoon . " They drove out in Brody 's car . As they pulled into Foote 's driveway , Hendricks said , " What do you bet they 're all asleep ? I remember last summer a woman called at one in the morning and asked if I could come out as early as possiblethe next morning because she thought some of her jewelry was missing . I offered to go right then , but she said no , she was going to bed . Anyway , I showed up at ten o'clock the next morning and she threw me out . I did n't mean this early , ' she says . " " We 'll see , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dame , they 'll be awake . " The door opened almost before Brody had finished knocking . " We 've been waiting to hear from you , " said a young man . " I 'm Tom Cassidy . Did you find her ? " " I 'm Chief Brody . This is Officer Hendricks . No , Mr. Cassidy , we did n't find her . Can we come in ? " " Oh sure , sure . I 'm sorry . Go on in the living room . I 'll get the Footes . " It took less than five minutes for Brody to learn everything he felt he needed to know . Then , as much to seem thorough as from any hope of learning anything useful , he asked to see the missing woman 's clothes . He was shown into the bedroom , and he looked through the clothing on the bed . " She did n't have a bathing suit with her ? "  | " No , " said Cassidy . " It 's in the top drawer over there . I looked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his words , then said , " Mr. Cassidy , I do n't mean to sound flip or anything , but has this Miss Watkins got a habit of doing strange things ? I mean , like taking off in the middle of the night .. . or walking around naked ? " " Not that I know of , " said Cassidy . " But I really do n't know her too well . " " I see , " said Brody . " Then I guess we 'd better go down to the beach again . You do n't have to come . Hendricks and I can handle it . " " I 'd like to come , if you do n't mind . " " I do n't mind . I just thought you might not want to . " The three men walked down to the beach . Cassidy showed the policemen where he had fallen asleep  --  the indentation his body had made in the sand had not been disturbed  --  and he pointed out where he had found the woman 's clothes . Brody looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could see , more than a mile in both directions , the beach was empty . Clumps of seaweed were the only dark spots on the white sand . " Let 's take a walk , " he said . " Leonard , you go east as far as the point . Mr. Cassidy , let 's you and I go west . You got your whistle , Leonard ? Just in case . " " I 've got it , " said Hendricks . " You care if I take my shoes off ? It 's easier walking on the hard sand , I do n't want to get them wet . " " I do n't care , " said Brody . " Technically you 're off duty . You can take your pants off if you want . Of course , then I 'll arrest you for indecent exposure . " Hendricks started eastward . The wet sand felt crisp and cool on his feet . He walked with his head down and hispiap29hands in his pockets , looking at the tiny shells and tangles of seaweed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beetles  --  skittered out of his path , and when the wavewash receded , he saw minute bubbles pop above the holes made by sandworms . He enjoyed the walk . It was a funny thing , he thought , that when you live all your life in a place , you almost never do the things that tourists go there to do  --  like walk on the beach or go swimming in the ocean . He could n't remember the last time he went swimming . He was n't even sure he still owned a bathing suit . It was like something he had heard about New York  --  that half the people who live in the city never go to the top of the Empire State Building or visit the Statue of Liberty . Every now and then , Hendricks looked up to see how much closer he was to the point . Once he turned back to see if Brody and Cassidy had found anything . He guessed that they were nearly half a mile away . As he turned back and started walking again , Hendricks saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kelp that seemed unusually large . He was about thirty yards away from the clump when he began to think the weed might be clinging to something . When he reached the clump , Hendricks bent down to pull some of the weed away . Suddenly he stopped . For a few seconds he stared , frozen rigid . He fumbled in his pants pocket for his whistle , put it to his lips , and tried to blow . Instead , he vomited , staggered back , and fell to his knees . Snarled within the clump of weed was a woman 's head , still attached to shoulders , part of an arm , and about a third of her trunk . The mass of tattered flesh was a mottled bluegray , and as Hendricks spilled his guts into the sand , he thought  --  and the thought made him retch again  --  that thep30woman 's remaining breast looked as flat as a flower pressed in a memory book . " Wait , " said Brody , stopping and touching Cassidy 's arm . " I think that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning sun . He saw a black spot on the sand , which he assumed was Hendricks , and then he heard the whistle more clearly . " Come on , " he said , and the two men began to trot along the sand . Hendricks was still on his knees when they got to him . He had stopped puking , but his head still hung , mouth open , and his breathing rattled with phlegm . Brody was several steps ahead of Cassidy , and he said , " Mr. Cassidy , stay back there a second , will you ? " He pulled apart some of the weeds , and when he saw what was inside , he felt bile rise in his throat . He swallowed and closed his eyes . After a moment he said , " You might as well look now , Mr. Cassidy , and tell me if it 's her or not . " Cassidy was terrified . His eyes shifted between the exhaustedHendricks and the mass of weed . " That ? " he said , pointing at the weed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? What do you mean it 's her ? " Brody was still fighting to control his stomach . " I think , " he said , " that it may be part of her . " Reluctantly , Cassidy shuffled forward . Brody held back a piece of weed so Cassidy could get a clear look at the gray and gaping face . " Oh , my God ! " said Cassidy , and he put a hand to his mouth . " Is it her ? " Cassidy nodded , still staring at the face . Then he turned away and said , " What happened to her ? " " I ca n't be sure , " said Brody . " Offhand , I 'd say she was attacked by a shark . "  |p31Cassidy  's knees buckled , and as he sank to the sand , he said , " I think I 'm going to be sick . " He put his head down and retched . The stink of vomit reached Brody almost instantly , and he knew he had lost his struggle . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vomited too.  |p32Several  minutes passed before Brody felt well enough to stand , walk back to his car , and call for an ambulance from the Southampton Hospital , and it was almost an hour before the ambulance arrived and the truncated corpse was stuffed into a rubber bag and hauled away . By eleven o'clock , Brody was back in his office , filling out forms about the accident . He had completed everything but " cause of death " when the phone rang . " Carl Santos , Martin , " said the voice of the coroner . " Yeah , Carl . What have you got for me ? " " Unless you have any reason to suspect a murder , I 'd have to say shark . " " Murder ? " said Brody . " I 'm not suggesting anything . All I mean is that it 's conceivable  --  justbarely  --  that some nut could have done this job on the girl with an ax and a saw . " " I do n't think it 's a murder , Carl . I 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want to go off into left field  --  no suspect . " " Then it 's a shark . And a big bastard , too . Even the screw on an ocean liner would n't have done this . It might have cut her in two , but ... "  | " Okay , Carl , " said Brody . " Spare me the gore . My stomach'snone too hot already . " " Sorry , Martin . Anyway , I 'm going to put down shark attack . I 'd say that makes the most sense for you too , unless there are . . . you know . . . other considerations . " " No , " said Brody . " Not this time . Thanks for calling , Carl . " IIe hung up , typed " shark attack " in the " cause of death " space on the forms , and leaned back in his chair . The possibility that " other considerations " might be involved in this case had n't occurred to Brody . Those considerationswere the touchiest part of Brody 's job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protecting the common weal without compromising either himself or the law . It was the beginning of the summer season , and Brody knew that on the success or failure of those twelve brief weeks rested the fortunes of Amity for a whole year . A rich season meant prosperity enough to carry the town through the lean winter . The winter population of Amity was about 1,000 ; in a good summer the population jumped to nearly ro , 000 . And those 9,000 summer visitors kept the i , 000 permanentresidents alive for the whole year . Merchants  --  from the owners of the hardware store and the sporting goods store and the two gas stations to the local pharmacist  --  needed a boom summer to support them through the winter , during which they never broke even . The wives of carpenters , electricians , and plumbers worked during the summer as waitresses or real estate agents , to help keep their families going over the winter . There were only two year-round liquor licenses in Amity , so the twelve weeks of summer were critical to most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ break they could get : good weather , good fishing , and , above all , crowds.  |p34Even  after the best of summers , Amity winters were rough . Three of every ten families went on relief . Dozens of men were forced to move for the winter to the north shore of Long Island , where they scratched for work shucking scallopsfor a few dollars a day . Brody knew that one bad summer would nearly double the relief rolls . If every house was not rented , there would n't be enough work for Amity 's blacks , most of whom were gardeners , butlers , bartenders , and maids . And two or three bad summers in a row  --  a circumstance that , fortunately , had n't occurred in more than two decades  --  could create a cycle that could wreck the town . If people did n't have enough money to buy clothes or gas or ample food supplies , if they could n't afford to have their houses or their appliancesrepaired , then the merchants and service firms would fail to make enough to tide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down , and Amity 's citizens would start shopping elsewhere . The town would lose tax revenue . Municipalservices would deteriorate , and people would begin to move away . So there was a common , though tacit , understanding in Amity , born of the need to survive . Everyone was expected to do his bit to make sure that Amity remained a desirable summer community . A few years ago , Brody remembered , a young man and his brother had moved into town and set themselves up as carpenters . They came in the spring , when there was enough work preparing houses for summer residentsto keep everyone busy , so they were welcomed . They seemed competent enough , and several established carpentersbegan to refer work to them . But by midsummer , there were disquieting reports about the Felix Brothers . Albert Morris , the owner of Amity Hardware , let it be known that they were buying cheap steel nailsp35instead of galvanized nails and were charging their customersfor galvanized . In a seaside climate , steel nails begin to rust in a few months . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the Felixes had ordered a load of low-grade , green wood to use in some cabinets in a house on Scotch Road . The cabinet doors began to warp soon after they were installed . In a bar one night , the elder Felix , Armando , boasted to a drinking buddy that on his current job he was being paid to set supporting studs every sixteen inches but was actually placing them twenty-four inches apart . And the younger Felix , a twenty-one-year-old named Danny with a stubborn case of acne , liked to show his friends erotic books which he bragged he had stolen from the houses he worked in . Other carpenters stopped referring work to the Felixes , but by then they had built enough of a business to keep them going through the winter . Very quietly , the Amity understandingbegan to work . At first , there were just a few hints to the Felixes that they had outworn their welcome . Armando reacted arrogantly . Soon , annoying little mishaps began to bother him . All the tires on his truck would mysteriouslyempty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the Amity Gulf station , he was told that the air pump was broken . When he ran out of propane gas in his kitchen , the local gas company took eight days to deliver a new tank . His orders for lumber and other supplies were inexplicablymislaid or delayed . In stores where once he had been able to obtain credit he was now forced to pay cash . By the end of October , the Felix Brothers were unable to function as a business , and they moved away . Generally , Brody 's contribution to the Amity understanding  --  in addition to maintaining the rule of law and sound judgment in the town  --  consisted of suppressing rumors and ,  |p36in  consultation with Harry Meadows , the editor of the Amity Leader , keeping a certain perspective on the rare unfortunateoccurrences that qualified as news . The previous summer 's rapes had been reported in the Leader , but just barely ( as molestations ) , because Brody and Meadows agreed that the specter of a black rapist stalkingevery female in Amity would n't do much for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added problem that none of the women who had told the police they had been raped would repeat their stories to anyone else . If one of the wealthier summer residents of Amity was arrested for drunken driving , Brody was willing , on a first offense , to book him for driving without a license , and that charge would be duly reported in the Leader . But Brody made sure to warn the driver that the second time he was caught driving under the influence he would be charged , booked , and prosecuted for drunk driving . Brody 's relationship with Meadows was based on a delicatebalance . When groups of youngsters came to town from the Hamptons and caused trouble , Meadows was handed every fact  --  names , ages , and charges lodged . When Amity 's own youth made too much noise at a party , the Leader usually ran a one-paragraph story without names or addresses , informing the public that the police had been called to quell a minor disturbance on , say , Old Mill Road . Because several summer residents found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wintertime vandalism of summer houses was particularly sensitive . For years , Meadows had ignored it  --  leaving it to Brody to make sure that the homeowner was notified , the offenders punished , and the appropriate repairmen dispatched to the house . But in the winter of 1968 sixteen houses were vandalizedwithin a few weeks . Brody and Meadows agreed thatp37the time had come for a full campaign in the Leader against wintertime vandals . The result was the wiring of the fortyeighthomes to the police station , which  --  since the public did n't know which houses were wired and which were n't  --  all but eliminated vandalism , made Brody 's job much easier , and gave Meadows the image of a crusading editor . Once in a while , Brody and Meadows collided . Meadows was a zealot against the use of narcotics . He was also a man with unusually keen reportorial antennae , and when he sensed a story  --  one not susceptible to " other considerations "  --  he would go after it like a pig after truffles . In the summer of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had died off the Scotch Road beach . To Brody , there was no evidence of foul play , and since the family opposed an autopsy , the death was officially listed as drowning . But Meadows had reason to believe that the girl was on drugs and that she was being supplied by the son of a Polish potato farmer . It took Meadows almost two months to get the story , but in the end he forced an autopsy which proved that at the time she drowned the girl had been unconscious from an overdose of heroin . He also tracked down the pusher and exposed a fairly large drug ring operating in the Amity area . The story reflected badly on Amity and worse on Brody , who , because several federal violations were involved in the case , was n't even able to redeem his earlier insouciance by making an arrest or two . And it won Meadows two regional journalism prizes . Now it was Brody 's turn to press for full disclosure . He intended to close the beaches for a couple of days , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoreline . He did n't know whether or not sharks could acquire a taste for human flesh ( as he had heard tigers do ) , but he was determined to deprive the fish of any more people . This time hep38wanted publicity , to make people fear the water and stay away from it . Brody knew there would be a strong argument against publicizing the attack . Like the rest of the country , Amity was still feeling the effects of the recession . So far , the summer was shaping up as a mediocre one . Rentals were up from last year , but they were not " good " rentals . Many were " groupers , " bands of ten or fifteen young people who came from the city and split the rent on a big house . At least a dozen of the $7,000  --  Sro , 000-a-season shore-front houses had not yet been rented , and many more in the $5,000 class were still without leases . Sensational reports of a shark attack might turn mediocrity into disaster . Still , Brody thought , one death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be quickly forgotten . Certainlyit would have less effect than two or three more deaths would . The fish might well have disappeared already , but Brody was n't willing to gamble lives on the possibility : the odds might be good , but the stakes were prohibitively high . He dialed Meadows ' number . " Hey , Harry , " he said . " Free for lunch ? " " I 've been wondering when you 'd call , " said Meadows . " Sure . My place or yours ? " Suddenly Brody wished he had n't called at mealtime . His stomach was still groaning , and the thought of food nauseatedhim . He glanced up at the wall calendar . It was a Thursday . Like all their friends on fixed , tight incomes , the Brodys shopped according to the supermarket specials . Monday 's special was chicken , Tuesday 's lamb , and so forth through the week . As each item was consumed , Ellen wouldnote it on her list and replace it the next week . The only variables were bluefish and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friendly fisherman dropped his overage byp39the house . Thursday 's special was hamburger , and Brody had seen enough chopped meat for one day . " Yours , " he said . " Why do n't we order out from Cy 's ? We can eat in your office . " " Fine with me , " said Meadows . " What do you want ? I 'll order now . " " Egg salad , I guess , and a glass of milk . I 'll be right there . " Brody called Ellen to tell her he would n't be home for lunch . Harry Meadows was an immense man , for whom the act of drawing breath was exertion enough to cause perspiration to dot his forehead . He was in his late forties , ate too much , chain-smoked cheap cigars , drank bonded Bourbon , and was , in the words of his doctor , the Western world 's leading candidate for a huge coronary infarction . When Brody arrived , Meadows was standing beside his desk , waving a towel at the open window . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a tender stomach , " he said , " I am trying to clear the air of essence of White Owl . " " I appreciate that , " said Brody . He glanced around the small , cluttered room , searching for a place to sit . " Just throw that crap off the chair there , " Meadows said . " They 're just government reports . Reports from the county , reports from the state , reports from the highway commission and the water commission . They probably cost about a million dollars , and from an informational point of view they do n't amount to a cup of spit . " Brody picked up the heap of papers and piled them atop a radiator . He pulled the chair next to Meadows ' desk and sat down . Meadows rooted around in a large brown paper bag , pulled out a plastic cup and a cellophane-wrapped sand/wich , and slid them across the desk to Brody . Then he began to unwrap his own lunch , four separate packages which he opened and spread before himself with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : a meatball hero , oozing tomato sauce ; a plastic carton filled with oily fried potatoes ; a dill pickle the size of a small squash ; and a quarter of a lemon meringue pie . He reached behind his chair and from a small refrigerator withdrew a sixteen-ounce can of beer . " Delightful , " he said with a smile as he surveyed the feast before him . " Amazing , " said Brody , stifling an acid belch . " Absofuckinlutelyamazing . I must have had about a thousand meals with you , Harry , but I still ca n't get used to it . " " Everyone has his little quirks , my friend , " Meadows said as he lifted his sandwich . " Some people chase other people 's wives . Some lose themselves in whiskey . I find my solace in nature 's own nourishment . " " That 'll be some solace to Dorothy when your heart says , That 's enough , buster , adios . ' " We 've discussed that , Dorothy and I , " said Meadows , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " and we agree that one of the few advantages man has over other animals is the ability to choose the way to bring on his own death . Food may well kill me , but it 's also what has made life such a pleasure . Besides , I 'd rather go my way than end up in the belly of a shark . After this morning , I 'm sure you 'll agree . " " Brody was in the midst of swallowing a bite of egg salad sandwich , and he had to force it past a rising gag . " Do n't do that to me , " he said . They ate in silence for a few moments . Brody finished his sandwich and milk , wadded the sandwich wrapper and stuffed it into the plastic cup . He leaned back and lit ap41cigarette . Meadows was still eating , but Brody knew his appetite would n't be diminished by any discussion . He recalled a time when Meadows had visited the scene of a bloody automobile accident and proceeded to interview police and survivors while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing , " Brody said . " I have a couple of thoughts , if you want to hear them . " Meadows nodded . " First , it seems to me that the cause of death is cut-anddried . I 've already talked to Santos , and  --  " " I did , too . " " So you know what he thinks . It was a shark attack , clear and simple . And if you 'd seen the body , you 'd agree . There 's just no  --  " " I did see it . " Brody was astonished , mostly because he could n't imagine how anyone who had seen that mess could be sitting there now , licking lemon-pie filling off his fingers . " So you agree ? " " Yes . I agree that 's what killed her . But there are a few things I 'm not so sure of . " " Like what ? " " Like why she was swimming at that time of night . Do you know what the temperature was at around midnight ? Sixty . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifty . You 'd have to be out of your mind to go swimming under those conditions . " " Or drunk , " said Brody , " which she probably was . " " Maybe . No , you 're right  --  probably . I 've checked around a little , and the Footes do n't mess with grass or mescaline or any of that stuff . There 's one other thing that bothers me , though . " Brody was annoyed . " For Christ 's sake , Harry , stop chasingshadows . Once in a while , people do die by accident . "  | " It 's not that . It 's just that it 's damn funny that we 've got a shark around here when the water 's still this cold . " " Is it ? Maybe there are sharks who like cold water . Who knows about sharks ? " " There are some . There 's the Greenland shark , but they never come down this far , and even if they did , they do n't usually bother people . Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At the moment I know a hell of a lot more about them than I did this morning . After I saw what was left of Miss Watkins , I called a young guy I know up at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute . I described the body to him , and he said it 's likely that only one kind of shark would do a job like that . " " What kind ? " " A great white . There are others that attack people , like tigers and hammerheads and maybe even makos and blues , but this fellow Hooper  --  Matt Hooper  --  told me that to cut a woman in half like that you 'd have to have a fish with a mouth like this "  --  he spread his hands about three feet apart  --  " and the only shark that grows that big and attacks people is the great white . There 's another name for them . " " Oh ? " Brody was beginning to lose interest . " What 's that ? " " Man-eater . Other sharks kill people once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hunger , maybe , or confusion or because they smell blood in the water . By the way , did the Watkins girl have her period last night ? " " How the hell would I know ? " " Just curious . Hooper said that 's one way to guarantee yourself an attack if there 's a shark around . " " What did he say about the cold water ? " " That it 's quite common for a great white to come into water this cold . Some years ago , a boy was killed by one near San Francisco . The water temperature was fifty-seven . "  |p43Brody  sucked a long drag from his cigarette and said , " You 've really done a lot of checking into this , Harry . " " It seemed to me a matter of  --  shall we say  --  common sense and public interest to determine exactly what happened and the chances of it happening again . " " And did you determine those chances ? " " I did . They 're almost nonexistent . From what I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Hooper , the only thing good about great whites is that they 're scarce . There 's every reason to believe that the shark that attacked the Watkins girl is long gone . There are no reefs around here . There 's no fish-processing plant or slaughterhouse that dumps blood or guts into the water . So there 's nothing at all to keep the shark interested . " Meadows paused and looked at Brody , who returned his gaze silently . " So it seems to me , Martin , that there 's no reason to get the public all upset over something that 's almost sure not to happen again . " " That 's one way to look at it , Harry . Another is that since it 's not likely to happen again , there 's no harm in telling people that it did happen this once . " Meadows sighed . " Journalistically , you may be right . But I think this is one of those times , Martin , when we have to forget the book and think of what 's best for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the public interest to spread this around . I 'm not thinking about the townspeople . They 'll know about it soon enough , the ones that do n't know already . But what about the people who read the Leader in New York or Philadelphia or Cleveland ? " " You flatter yourself . " " Balls . You know what I mean . And you know what the real estate situation is like around here this summer . We 're right on the edge , and other places are , too , like Nantucket and the Vineyard and East Hampton . There are people whop44still have n't made their summer plans . They know they 've got their pick of places this year . There 's no shortage of houses for rent . . . anywhere . If I run a story saying that a young woman was bitten in two by a monster shark off Amity , there wo n't be another house rented in this town . Sharks are like ax-murderers , Martin . People react to them with their guts . There 's something crazy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's a killer shark around here , we can kiss the summer good-by . " Brody nodded . " I ca n't argue with that , Harry , and I do n't want to tell the people that there is a killer shark around here . Look at it from my point of view , just for a second . I wo n't dispute your odds or anything . You 're probably right . That shark has probably gone a hundred miles from here and wo n't ever show up again . The most dangerousthing out there in the water is probably the undertow . But , Harry , there 's a chance you 're wrong , and I do n't think we can take that chance . Suppose  --  just suppose  --  we do n't say a word , and somebody else gets hit by that fish . What then ? My ass is in a sling . I 'm supposed to protect people around here , and if I ca n't protect them from something , the least I can do is warn them that there is a danger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 're supposed to report the news , and there 's just no question but that someone killed by a shark is news . I want you to run the story , Harry . I want to close the beaches , just for a couple of days , and just for insurance sake . It wo n't be a great inconvenience to anybody . There are n't that many people here yet , and the water 's cold . If we tell it straight , tell people what happenedand why we 're doing what we 're doing , I think we 'll be way ahead . " Meadows sat back in his chair and thought for a moment.  | " I ca n't speak for your job , Martin , but as far as mine is concerned , the decision has already been made . " " What does that mean ? " " There wo n't be any story about the attack in the Leader . " " Just like that . " " Well , not exactly . It was n't entirely my decision , though I think that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this paper , Martin , and I own a piece of it , but not a big enough piece to buck certain pressures . " " Such as ? " " I 've gotten six phone calls already this morning . Five were from advertisers  --  one restaurant , one hotel , two real estate firms , and an ice cream shop . They were most anxious to know whether or not I planned to run a story on the Watkins thing , and most anxious to let me know they felt Amity would best be served by letting the whole thing fade quietly away . The sixth call was from Mr. Coleman in New York . Mr. Coleman who owns fifty-five per cent of the Leader . It seems Mr. Coleman had received a few phone calls himself . He told me there would be no story in the Leader . " " I do n't suppose he said whether the fact that his wife is a real estate broker had anything to do with his decision . " " No , " said Meadows . " The subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harry , where does that leave us ? You 're not going to run a story , so as far as the good readers of the Leader are concerned , nothing ever happened . I 'm going to close the beaches and put up a few signs saying why . " " Okay , Martin . That 's your decision . But let me remind you of something . You 're an elected official , right ? " " Just like the President . For four thrill-filled years . " " Elected officials can be impeached . " " Is that a threat , Harry ? " Meadows smiled . " You know better than that . Besides ,  |p46who  am I to be making threats ? I just want you to be aware of what you 're doing before you tinker with the lifeblood of all those sage and discriminating souls who elected you . " Brody rose to go . " Thanks , Harry . I 've always heard it 's lonely here at the top . What do I owe you for lunch ? " " Forget it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family will soon be begging for food stamps . " Brody laughed . " No way . Have n't you heard ? The great thing about police work is the security . " Ten minutes after Brody returned to his office , the intercombuzzer sounded and a voice announced , " The mayor 's here to see you , Chief . " " Brody smiled . The mayor . Not Larry Vaughan , just calling to check in . Not Lawrence Vaughan of Vaughan 6z Penrose Real Estate , stopping by to complain about some noisy tenants . But Mayor Lawrence P. Vaughan , the people 's choice  --  by seventy-one votes in the last election . " Send his honor in , " Brody said . Larry Vaughan was a handsome man , in his early fifties , with a full head of salt-and-pepper hair and a body kept trim by exercise . Though he was a native of Amity , over the years he had developed an air of understated chic . He had made a great deal of money in postwar real estate speculation in Amity , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partner , since no one had ever met or spoken to anyone named Penrose in Vaughan 's office ) in the most successful agency in town . He dressed with elegant simplicity , in timelessBritish jackets , button-down shirts , and Weejun loafers . Unlike Ellen Brody , who had descended from summer folk to winter folk and was unable to make the adjustment , Vaughan had ascended smoothly from winter folk to summerfolk , adjusting each step of the way with grace . He wasp47not one of them , for he was technically a local merchant , so he was never asked to visit them in New York or Palm Beach . But in Amity he moved freely among all but the most aloof members of the summer community , which , of course , did an immense amount of good for his business . He was asked to most of the important summer parties , and he always arrivedalone . Very few of his friends knew that he had a wife at home , a simple , adoring woman who spent much of her time doing needlepoint in front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't see much of him during the summer , but after Labor Day , when things calmed down , Vaughan felt free to shed some of his social scales , and every few weeks he and his wife would ask Brody and Ellen out to dinner at one of the better restaurants in the Hamptons . The evenings were special treats for Ellen , and that in itself was enough to make Brody happy . Vaughan seemed to understand Ellen . He always acted most graciously , treating Ellen as a clubmate and comrade . Vaughan walked into Brody 's office and sat down . " I just talked to Harry Meadows , " he said . Vaughan was obviously upset , which interested Brody . He had n't expected this reaction . " I see , " he said . " Harry does n't waste any time . " " Where are you going to get the authority to close the beaches ? " " Are you asking me as the mayor or as a real estate broker or out of friendly interest or what , Larry ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trouble controlling his temper . " I want to know where you 're going to get the authority . I want to know now . " " Officially , I 'm not sure I have it , " Brody said . " There 's something in the code that says I can take whatever actions I deem necessary in the event of an emergency , but I thinkp48the selectmen have to declare a state of emergency . I do n't imagine you want to go through all that rigmarole . " " Not a chance . " " Well , then , unofficially I figure it 's my responsibility to keep the people who live here as safe as I can , and at the moment it 's my judgment that that means closing the beaches for a couple of days . If it ever came down to cases , I 'm not sure I could arrest anyone for going swimming . Unless , " Brody smiled , " I could make a case of criminal stupid-ity . " Vaughan ignored the remark . " I do n't want you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I see . " " You know why . The Fourth of July is n't far off , and that 's the make-or-break weekend . We 'd be cutting our own throats . " " I know the argument , and I 'm sure you know my reasons for wanting to close the beaches . It 's not as if I have anything to gain . " " No . I 'd say quite the opposite is true . Look , Martin , this town does n't need that kind of publicity . " " It does n't need any more people killed , either . " " Nobody else is going to get killed , for God 's sake . All you 'd be doing by closing the beaches is inviting a lot of reportersto come snooping around where they do n't have any business . " " So ? They 'd come out here , and when they did n't find anything worth reporting , they 'd go home again . I do n't imagine the New York Times has much interest in covering a lodge picnic or a garden-club supper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Suppose they did find something . There 'd be a big to-do that could n't do anybody any good . "  | " Like what , Larry ? What could they find out ? I do n't have anything to hide . Do you ? " " No , of course not . I was just thinking about . . , maybe the rapes . Something unsavory . " " Crap , " said Brody . " That 's all past history . " " Dammit , Martin ! " Vaughan paused for a moment , struggling to calm himself . " Look , if you wo n't listen to reason , will you listen to me as a friend ? I 'm under a lot of pressurefrom my partners . Something like this could be very bad for us . " Brody laughed . " That 's the first time I 've heard you admit you had partners , Larry . I thought you ran that shop like an emperor . " Vaughan was embarrassed , as if he felt he had said toomuch . " My business is very complicated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm not sure I understand what 's going on . Do me this favor . This once . " Brody looked at Vaughan , trying to fathom his motives . " I 'm sorry , Larry , I ca n't . I would n't be doing my job . " " If you do n't listen to me , " said Vaughan , " you may not have your job much longer . " " You have n't got any control over me . You ca n't fire any cop in this town . " " Not off the force , no . But believe it or not , I do have discretionover the job of chief of police . " " I do n't believe it . " From his jacket pocket Vaughan took a copy of the corporatecharter of the town of Amity . " You can read it yourself , " he said , flipping through until he found the page he sought . " It 's right here . " He handed the pamphlet across the desk to Brody . " What it says , in effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chief 's job by the people , the selectmenhave the power to remove you . "  |p50Brody  read the paragraph Vaughan had indicated . " I guess you 're right , " he said . " But I 'd love to see what you put down for good and sufficient cause . " " I dearly hope it does n't come to that , Martin . I had hoped this conversation would n't even get this far . I had hoped that you would go along , once you knew how I and the selectmen felt . " " All the selectmen ? " " A majority . " " Like who ? " " I 'm not going to sit here and name names for you . I do n't have to . All you have to know is that I have the board behind me , and if you wo n't do what 's right , well put someone in your job who will . " Brody had never seen Vaughan in a mood so aggressively ugly . He was fascinated , but he was also slightly shaken . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " I do . " Sensing victory , Vaughan said evenly , " Trust me , Martin . You wo n't be sorry . " Brody sighed . " Shit , " he said . " I do n't like it . It does n't smell good . But okay , if it 's that important " " It 's that important . " For the first time since he had arrived , Vaughan smiled . " Thanks , Martin , " he said , and he stood up . " Now I have the rather unpleasant task of visiting the Footes . " " How are you going to keep them from shooting off their mouths to the Times or the News ? " " I hope to be able to appeal to their public-spiritedness , " Vaughan said , " just as I appealed to yours . " " Bull . " " We do have one thing going for us . Miss Watkins was a nobody . She was a drifter . No family , no close friends . Shep51said she had hitchhiked East from Idaho @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrived home a little before five . His stomach had settled down enough to permit him a beer or two before dinner . Ellen was in the kitchen , still dressed in the pink uniform of a hospital volunteer . Her hands were immersed in chopped meat , kneading it into a meat loaf . " Hello , " she said , turning her head so Brody could plant a kiss on her cheek . " What was the crisis ? " " You were at the hospital . You did n't hear ? " " No . Today was bathe-the-old-ladies day . I never got off the Ferguson wing . " " A girl got killed off Old Mill . " " By what ? " " A shark . " Brody reached into the refrigerator and found a beer . Ellen stopped kneading meat and looked at him . " A shark ! I 've never heard of that around here . You see one once in a while , but they never do anything . " " Yeah , I know . It 's a first for me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do ? " " Nothing . " " Really ? Is that sensible ? I mean , is n't there anything you can do ? " " Sure , there are some things I could do . Technically . But there 's nothing I can actually do . What you and I think does n't carry much weight around here . The powers-thatbeare worried that it wo n't look nice if we get all excited just because one stranger got killed by a fish . They 're willing to take the chance that it was just a freak accident that wo n't happen again . Or , rather , they 're willing to let me take the chance , since it 's my responsibility . "  | " What do you mean , the powers-that-be ? " " Larry Vaughan , for one . " " Oh . I did n't realize you had talked to Larry . " " He came to see me as soon as he heard I planned to close the beaches . He was n't what you 'd call subtle about telling me he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have my job if I did close them . " " I ca n't believe that , Martin . Larry is n't like that . " " I did n't think so , either . Hey , by the way , what do you know about his partners ? " " In the business ? I did n't think there were any . I thought Penrose was his middle name , or something like that . Anyway , I thought he owned the whole thing . " " So did I. But apparently not . " ' Well , it makes me feel better to know you talked to Larry before you made any decision . He tends to take a wider , more over-all view of things than most people . He probably does know what 's best . " Brody felt the blood rise in his neck . He said simply , " Crap . " Then he tore the metal tab off his beer can , flipped it into the garbage can , and walked into the living room to turn on the evening news . From the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : you had a call a little while ago . " " Who from ? " " He did n't say . He just said to tell you you 're doing a terrificjob . It was nice of him to call , do n't you think ? "  |p53For  the next few days the weather remained clear and unusuallycalm . The wind came softly , steadily from the southwest , a gentle breeze that rippled the surface of the sea but made no whitecaps . There was a crispness to the air only at night , and after days of constant sun , the earth and sand had warmed . Sunday was the twentieth of June . Public schools still had a week or more to run before breaking for the summer , but the private schools in New York had already released their charges . Families who owned summer homes in Amity had been coming out for weekends since the beginning of May . Summer tenants whose leases ran from June 15 to September15 had unpacked and , familiar now with where linen closets were , which cabinets contained good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were softer than others , were already beginning to feel at home . By noon , the beach in front of Scotch and Old Mill roads was speckled with people . Husbands lay semicomatose on beach towels , trying to gain strength from the sun before an afternoon of tennis and the trip back to New York on the Long Island Rail Road 's Cannonball . Wives leaned against aluminum backrests , reading Helen MacInnes and Johnp54Cheever and Taylor Caldwell , interrupting themselves now and then to pour a cup of dry vermouth from the Scotch cooler . Teen-agers lay serried in tight , symmetrical rows , the boys enjoying the sensation of grinding their pelvises into the sand , thinking of pudenda and occasionally stretching their necks to catch a brief glimpse of some , exposed , wittingly or not , by girls who lay on their backs with their legs spread . These were not Aquarians . They uttered none of the platitudesof peace or pollution , of justice or revolt . Privilege had been bred into them with genetic certainty . As their eyes were blue or brown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They had no vitamin deficiencies , no sickle-cell anemia . Their teeth  --  thanks either to breeding or to orthodontia  --  were straight and white and even . Their bodies were lean , their muscles toned by boxing lessons at age nine , riding lessons at twelve , and tennis lessonsever since . They had no body odor . When they sweated , the girls smelled faintly of perfume ; the boys smelled simply clean . None of which is to say that they were either stupid or evil . If their IQs could have been tested en masse , they would have shown native ability well within the top 10 per cent of all mankind . And they had been , were being , educated at schools that provided every discipline , including exposure to minority-group sensibilities , revoluntary philosophies , ecological hypotheses , political power tactics , drugs , and sex . Intellectually , they knew a great deal . Practically , they chose to know almost nothing . They had been conditioned to believe ( or , if not to believe , to sense ) that the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right . Nothing touched them  --  not race riots in places like Trenton , New Jersey , or Gary , Indiana ; not the fact thatp55parts of the Missouri River were so foul that the water sometimescaught fire spontaneously ; not police corruption in New York or the rising number of murders in San Francisco or revelations that hot dogs contained insect filth and hexachlorophinecaused brain damage . They were inured even to the economic spasms that wracked the rest of America . Undulations in the stock markets were nuisances noticed , if at all , as occasions for fathers to bemoan real or fancied extravagances . Those were the ones who returned to Amity every summer . The others  --  and there were some , mavericks  --  marched and bleated and joined and signed and spent their summers working for acronymic social-action groups . But because they had rejected Amity and , at most , showed up for an occasionalLabor Day weekend , they , too , were irrelevant . The little children played in the sand at the water 's edge , digging holes and flinging muck at each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what they would become . A boy of six stopped skimming flat stones out into the water . He walked up the beach to where his mother lay dozing , and he flopped down next to her towel . " Hey , Mom , " he said , limning aimless doodles with his finger in the sand . His mother turned to look at him , shielding her eyes from the sun . " What ? " " I 'm bored . " " How can you be bored ? It is n't even July . " " I do n't care . I 'm bored . I do n't have anything to do . " " You 've got a whole beach to play on . " " I know . But there 's nothing to do on it . Boy , am I bored . " " Why do n't you go throw a ball ? " " With who ? There 's nobody here . "  | " I see a lot of people . Have you looked for the Harrises ? What about Tommy Converse ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I sure am bored . " " Oh , for God 's sake , Alex . " " Can I go swimming ? " " No . It 's too cold . " " How do you know ? " " I know , that 's all . Besides , you know you ca n't go alone . " " Will you come with me ? " " Into the water ? Certainly not . " " No , I mean just to watch me . " " Alex , Mom is pooped , absolutely exhausted . Ca n't you find anything else to do ? " " Can I go out on my raft ? " " Out where ? " " Just out there a little ways . I wo n't go swimming . I 'll just lie on my raft . " His mother sat up and put on her sunglasses . She looked up and down the beach . A few dozen yards away , a man stood in waist-deep water with a child on his shoulders . The woman looked at him , indulging herself in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no longer shift to her husband the responsibility of amusing their child . Before she could turn her head , the boy guessed what she was feeling . " I bet Dad would let me , " he said . " Alex , you should know by now that that 's the wrong way to get me to do anything . " She looked down the beach in the other direction . Except for a few couples in the dim distance , it was empty . " Oh , all right , " she said . " Go ahead . But do n't go too far out . And do n't go swimming . " She looked at the boy and , to show she was serious , lowered her glasses so he could see her eyes . " Okay , " he said . He stood up , grabbed his rubber raft ,  |p57and  dragged it down to the water . He picked up the raft , held it in front of him , and walked seaward . When the waterreached his waist , he leaned forward . A swell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aboard . He centered himself so the raft lay flat . He paddled with both arms , stroking smoothly . His feet and ankles hung over the rear of the raft . He moved out a few yards , then turned and began to paddle up and down the beach . Though he did n't notice it , a gentle current carried him slowly offshore . Fifty yards farther out , the ocean floor dropped precipitously  --  notwith the sheerness of a canyon wall , but from a slope of perhaps ten degrees to more than forty-five degrees . The water was fifteen feet deep where the slope began to change . Soon it was twenty-five , then forty , then fifty feet deep . It leveled off at a hundred feet for about half a mile , then rose in a shoal that neared the surface a mile from shore . Seaward of the shoal , the floor dropped quickly to two hundred feet and then , still farther out , the true ocean depths began . In thirty-five feet of water , the great fish swam slowly , its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing , for the water was murky with motes of vegetation . The fish had been moving parallel to the shoreline . Now it turned , banking slightly , and followed the bottom gradually upward . The fish perceived more light in the water , but still it saw nothing . The boy was resting , his arms dangling down , his feet and ankles dipping in and out of the water with each small swell . His head was turned toward shore , and he noticed that he had been carried out beyond what his mother would considersafe . He could see her lying on her towel , and the man and child playing in the wavewash . He was not afraid , for the water was calm and he was n't really very far from shore  --  only forty yards or so . But he wanted to get closer ; otherwisehis mother might sit up , spy him , and order him out of the water . He eased himself back a little bit so he could use his feet to help propel himself . He began to kick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silently , but his kicking feet made erratic splashes and left swirls of bubblesin his wake . The fish did not hear the sound , but rather registered the sharp and jerky impulses emitted by the kicks . They were signals , faint but true , and the fish locked on them , homing . It rose , slowly at first , then gaining speed as the signals grew stronger . The boy stopped for a moment to rest . The signals ceased . The fish slowed , turning its head from side to side , trying to recover them . The boy lay perfectly still , and the fish passed beneath him , skimming the sandy bottom . Again it turned . The boy resumed paddling . He kicked only every third or fourth stroke ; kicking was more exertion than steady paddling . But the occasional kicks sent new signals to the fish . This time it needed to lock on them only an instant , for itwas almost directly below the boy . The fish rose . Nearly vertical , it now saw the commotion on the surface @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food , but food was not a concept of significance . The fish was impelledto attack : if what it swallowed was digestible , that was food ; if not , it would later be regurgitated . The mouth opened , and with a final sweep of the sickle tail the fish struck . The boy 's last  --  only  --  thought was that he had been punched in the stomach . The breath was driven from him in a sudden rush . He had no time to cry out , nor , had he had the time , would he have known what to cry , for he could not see the fish . The fish 's head drove the raft out of the water.  |p59The  jaws smashed together , engulfing head , arms , shoulders , trunk , pelvis , and most of the raft . Nearly half the fish had come clear of the water , and it slid forward and down in a belly-flopping motion , grinding the mass of flesh and bone and rubber . The boy 's legs were severed at the hips , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the beach the man with the child shouted , " Hey ! " He was not sure what he had seen . He had been looking toward the sea , then started to turn his head when an uproar caught his eye . He jerked his head back seaward again , but by then there was nothing to see but the waves made by the splash , spreading outward in a circle . " Did you see that ? " he cried . " Did you see that ? " " What , Daddy , what ? " His child stared up at him , excited . " Out there ! A shark or a whale or something ! Something huge ! " The boy 's mother , half asleep on her towel , opened her eyes and squinted at the man . She saw him point toward the water and heard him say something to the child , who ran up the beach and stood by a pile of clothing . The man began to run toward the boy 's mother , and she sat up . She did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pointing at the water , so she shaded her eyes and looked out to sea . At first , the fact that she saw nothing did n't strike her as odd . Then she remembered , and she said , " Alex . " Brody was having lunch : baked chicken , mashed potatoes , and peas . " Mashed potatoes , " he said as Ellen served him . " What are you trying to do to me ? " " I do n't want you to waste away . Besides , you look good chunky . " The phone rang . Ellen said , " I 'll get it , " but Brody stoodp60up . That was the way it usually happened . She would say , " I 'll get it , " but he was the one who got it . It was the same when she had forgotten something in the kitchen . She would say , " I forgot the napkins . I 'll get them . " But they both knew he would get up and fetch the napkins . " No , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably for me anyway . " He knew the call was probably for her , but the words came reflexively . " Bixby , Chief , " said the voice from the station house . " What is it , Bixby ? " " I think you 'd better come down here . " " Why 's that ? " " Well , it 's like this , Chief . . . . " Bixby obviously did n't want to go into details . Brody heard him say something to someone else , then return to the phone . " I 've got this hystericalwoman on my hands , Chief . " " What 's she hysterical about ? " " Her kid . Out by the beach . " A twinge of unease shot through Brody 's stomach . " What happened ? " " It 's . . . " Bixby faltered , then said quickly , " Thursday . " " Listen , asshole ... " Brody stopped , for now he understood . " I 'll be right there . " He hung up the phone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fury blended in a thrust of gut-wrenching pain . He felt at once betrayed and betrayer , deceived and deceiver . He was a criminal forced into crime , an unwilling whore . He had to take the blame , but it was not rightly his . It belonged to Larry Vaughan and his partners , whoever they might be . He had wanted to do the right thing ; they had forced him not to . But who were they to force him ? If he could n't stand up to Vaughan , what kind of cop was he ? He should have closed the beaches.  |p61Su|p|pose  he had . The fish would have gone down the beach  --  say , to East Hampton  --  and killed someone there . But that was n't how it had worked . The beaches had stayed open , and a child had been killed because of it . It was as simple as that . Cause and effect . Brody suddenly loathed himself . And just as suddenly , he felt great pity for himself . " What is it ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " How ? " " By a goddamn sonofabitch of a shark . " " Oh no ! If you had closed the beaches . . . " She stopped , embarrassed . " Yeah , I know . " Harry Meadows was waiting in the parking lot at the rear of the station house when Brody drove up . He opened the passenger-side door of Brody 's car and eased his bulk down onto the seat . " So much for the odds , " he said . " Yeah . Who 's in there , Harry ? " " A man from the Times , two from Newsday , and one of my people . And the woman . And the man who says he saw it happen . " " How did the Times get hold of it ? " " Bad luck . He was on the beach . So was one of the Newsdayguys . They 're both staying with people for the weekend . They were onto it within two minutes . " " What time did it happen ? " Meadows looked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No more . " " Do they know about the Watkins thing ? " " I do n't know . My man does , but he knows enough not to talk . As for the others , it depends on who they 've been talk/ing to . I doubt they 're onto it . They have n't had any digging time . " " They 'll get onto it , sooner or later . " " I know , " said Meadows . " It puts me in a rather difficult position . " " You ! Do n't make me laugh . " " Seriously , Martin . If somebody from the Times gets that story and files it , it 'll appear in tomorrow 's paper , along with today 's attack , and the Leader will look like hell . I 'm going to have to use it , to cover myself , even if the others do n't . " " Use it how , Harry ? What are you going to say ? " " I do n't know yet . As I said , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are you going to say ordered it hushed up ? Larry Vaughan ? " " Hardly . " " Me ? " " No , no . I 'm not going to say anybody ordered it hushed up . There was no conspiracy . I 'm going to talk to Carl Santos . If I can put the right words in his mouth , we may all be spared a lot of grief . " " What about the truth ? " " What about it ? " " What about telling it the way it happened ? Say that I wanted to close the beaches and warn people , but the selectmendisagreed . And say that because I was too much of a chicken to fight and put my job on the line , I went along with them . Say that all the honchos in Amity agreed there was no point in alarming people just because there was a shark around that liked to eat children . " " Come on , Martin . It was n't your fault . It was n't anybody 's . We came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's all there is to it . "  | " Terrific . Now I 'll just go tell the kid 's mother that we 're terribly sorry we had to use her son for chips . " Brody got out of the car and started for the back door of the station house . Meadows , slower to extract himself , followed a few paces behind . Brody stopped . " You know what I 'd like to know , Harry ? Who really made the decision ? You went along with it . I went along with it . I do n't think Larry Vaughan was even the actual guy who made the decision . I think he went along with it , too . " " What makes you think so ? " " I 'm not sure . Do you know anything about his partners in the business ? " " He does n't have any real partners , does he ? " " I 'm beginning to wonder . Anyway , fuck it . . . for now . " Brody took another step , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You better go around front , Harry ... for appearances sake . " Brody entered his office through a side door . The boy 's mother was sitting in front of the desk , clutching a handkerchief . She was wearing a short robe over her bathing suit . Her feet were bare . Brody looked at her nervously , once again feeling the rush of guilt . He could n't tell if she was crying , for her eyes were masked by large , round sunglasses . A man was standing by the back wall . Brody assumed he was the one who claimed to have witnessed the accident . He was gazing absently at Brody 's collection of memorabilia : citations from community-service groups , pictures of Brody with visiting dignitaries . Not exactly the stuff to command much attention from an adult , but staring at it was preferableto risking conversation with the woman . Brody had never been adept at consoling people , so he simply introduced himself and started asking questions.  |p64The  woman said she had seen nothing : one moment the boy was there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw were pieces of his raft . " Her voice was weak but steady . The man describedwhat he had seen , or what he thought he had seen . " So no one actually saw this shark , " Brody said , courting a faint hope in the back of his mind . " No , " said the man . " I guess not . But what else could it have been ? " " Any number of things . " Brody was lying to himself as well as to them , testing to see if he could believe his own lies , wondering if any alternative to reality could be made credible . " The raft could have gone flat and the boy could have drowned . " " Alex is a good swimmer , " the woman protested . " Or .. was . . . . " And what about the splash ? " said the man . " The boy could have been thrashing around . " " He never cried out . Not a word . " Brody realized that the exercise was futile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll probably know soon enough , anyway . " " What do you mean ? " said the man . " One way or another , people who die in the water usually wash up somewhere . If it was a shark , there 'll be no mistakingit . " The woman 's shoulders hunched forward , and Brody cursed himself for being a clumsy fool . " I 'm sorry , " he said . The woman shook her head and wept . Brody told the woman and the man to wait in his office , and he walked out into the front of the station house . Meadowswas standing by the outer door , leaning against the wall . A young man  --  the reporter from the Times , Brody guessed  --  was gesturing at Meadows and seemed to be askingquestions . The young man was tall and slim . He wore sandals and a bathing suit and a short-sleeved shirt with anp65alligator emblem stitched to the left breast , which caused Brody to take an instant , instinctive dislike to the man . In his adolescence Brody had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All the summer people wore them . Brody badgered his mother until she bought him one  --  " a two-dollar shirt with a six-dollar lizard on it , " she said  --  and when he did n't find himself suddenly wooed by gagglesof summer people , he was humiliated . He tore the alligatoroff the pocket and used the shirt as a rag to clean the lawn mower with which he earned his summer income . More recently , Ellen had insisted on buying several shifts made by the same manufacturer  --  paying a premium they could ill afford for the alligator emblem  --  to help her regain her entree to her old milieu . To Brody 's dismay , one evening he found himself nagging Ellen for buying " a ten-dollar dress with a twenty-dollar lizard on it . " Two men were sitting on a bench  --  the Newsday reporters . One wore a bathing suit , the other a blazer and slacks . Meadows ' reporter  --  Brody knew him as Nat something or other  --  was leaning against the desk , chatting with Bixby . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What can I do for you ? " Brody said . The young man next to Meadows took a step forward and said , " I 'm Bill Whitman , from the New York Times . " " And ? " What am I supposed to do ? Brody thought . Fall on my ass ? " I was on the beach . " " What did you see ? " One of the Newsday reporters interrupted : " Nothing . I was there , too . Nobody saw anything . Except maybe the guy in your office . He says he saw something . " " I know , " said Brody , " but he 's not sure just what it was he saw . "  |p66The  Times man said , " Are you prepared to list this as a shark attack ? " " I 'm not prepared to list this as anything , and I 'd suggest you do n't go listing it as anything , either , until you know a hell of a lot more about it than you do now . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what do you want us to do ? Call it a mysterious disappearance ? Boy lost at sea ? " It was difficult for Brody to resist the temptation to trade angry ironies with the Times reporter . He said , " Listen , Mr.  --  Whitman , is it ?  --  Whitman . We have no witnesses who saw anything but a splash . The man inside thinks he saw a big silver-colored thing that he thinks may have been a shark . He says he has never seen a live shark in his life , so that 's not what you 'd call expert testimony . We have no body , no real evidence that anything violent happened to the boy .. . I mean , except that he 's missing . It is conceivable that he drowned . It is conceivable that he had a fit or a seizure of some kind and then drowned . And it is conceivable that he was attacked by some kind of fish or animal  --  or even person , for that matter . All of those things are possible , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over gravel in the public parking lot out front stopped Brody . A car door slammed , and Len Hendricks charged into the station house , wearing nothing but a bathing suit . His body had the mottled graywhitenessof a Styrofoam coffee cup . He stopped in the middle of the floor . " Chief ... " Brody was startled by the unlikely sight of Hendricks in a bathing suit  --  thighs flecked with pimples , genitals bulging in the tight fabric . " You 've been swimming , Leonard ? " " There 's been another attack ! " said Hendricks . The Times man quickly asked , " When was the first one ? "  |p67Before  Hendricks could answer , Brody said , " We were just discussing it , Leonard . I do n't want you or anyone else jumping to conclusions until you know what you 're talking about . For God 's sake , the boy could have drowned . " " Boy ? " said Hendricks . " What boy ? This was a man , an old man . Five minutes ago . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bloody murder and his head went under water and it came up again and he screamed something else and then he went down again .

" Hendricks paused , staring at the floor . His breath squeezed out of his chest in short bursts . " Then the fish quit . Maybe he went away , I do n't know . I waded out to where the guy was floating . His face was in the water . I took hold of one of his arms and pulled . " Brody said , " And ? " " It came off in my hand .

About three quarters of the way down the right-hand column on page one , he saw the headline : SHARK KILLS TWO ON LONG ISLANDBrody said , " Shit , " and began to read . By William F. Whitman Special to The New York TimesAMITY , L.I . June 20  --  A six-year-old boy and a 65-year-old man were killed today in separate shark attacks that occurred within an hour of each other near the beaches of this resort community . Although the body of the boy , Alexander Kintner , was not found , officials said there was no question that he was killed by a shark . A witness , Thomas Daguerre , of New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the water and seize the boy and his rubber raft and disappear into the water with a splash . Amity coroner Carl Santos reported that traces of bloodp69found on shreds of rubber recovered later left no doubt that the boy had died a violent death . At least fifteen persons witnessed the attack on Morris Cater , 65 , which took place at approximately z p.m. a quarter of a mile down the beach from where young Kintner was attacked . Apparently , Mr. Cater was swimming just beyond the surf line when he was suddenly struck from behind . He called out for help , but all attempts to rescue him were in vain . " I went in up to my waist and tried to get to him , " said Amity police officer Leonard Hendricks , who was on the beach at the time , " but the fish kept hitting him . " Mr. Cater , a jewelry wholesaler with offices at 1224 Avenueof the Americas , was pronounced dead on arrival at Southampton Hospital . These incidents are the first documented cases of shark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two decades . According to Dr. David Dieter , an icthyologist at the New York Aquarium at Coney Island , it is logical to assume  --  but by no means a certainty  --  that both attacks were the work of one shark . " At this time of year in these waters , " said Dr. Dieter , " there are very few sharks . It 's rare at any time of year for sharks to come so close to the beach . So the chances that two sharks would be off the same beach at virtually the same time  --  and would each attack someone  --  are infinitesimal . " When informed that one witness described the shark that attacked Mr. Cater as being " as large as a station wagon , " Dr. Dieter said the shark was probably a " great white " ( Carcharodon carcharias ) , a species known throughout the world for its voraciousness and aggressiveness . In 1916 , he said , a great white killed four bathers in New Jersey on one day  --  the only other recorded instance of multipleshark-attack fatalities in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the attacks to " bad luck , like a flash of lightning that hits a house . The shark was probably just passing by . It happened to be a nice day , and therep70happened to be people swimming , and he happened to come along . It was pure chance . " Amity is a summer community on the south shore of Long Island , approximately midway between Bridgehampton and East Hampton , with a wintertime population of 1,000 . In the summer , the population increases to 10,000 . Brody finished reading the article and set the paper on the desk . Chance , that doctor said , pure chance . What would he say if he knew about the first attack ? Still pure chance ? Or would it be negligence , gross and unforgivable ? There were three people dead now , and two of them could still be alive , if only Brody had .. . " You 've seen the Times , " said Meadows . He was standing in the doorway . " Yeah , I 've seen it . They did n't pick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kind of curious , especially after Len 's little slip of the tongue . " " But you did use it . " " I did . I had to . Here . " Meadows handed Brody a copy of the Amity Leader . The banner headline ran across all sixcolumns of page one : TWO KILLED BY MONSTER SHARK OFF AMITY BEACH . Below that , in smaller type , a subhead : Numberof Victims of Killer Fish Rises to Three . " You sure get your news up high , Harry . " " Read on . " Brody read : Two summer visitors to Amity were brutally slain yesterdayby a man-eating shark that attacked them as they frolickedin the chill waters off the Scotch Road beach . Alexander Kintner , age 6 , who lived with his mother in the Goose Neck Lane house owned by Mr. and Mrs. Richard Packer , was the first to die  --  attacked from below as he lay on a rubber raft . His body has not been found.  |p71Less  than half an hour later , Morris Cater , 65 , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was attacked from behind as he swam in the gentle surf off the public beach . The giant fish struck again and again , savaging Mr. Cater as he cried for help . Patrolman Len Hendricks , who by sheer coincidence was taking his first swim in five years , made a valiant attempt to rescue the struggling victim , but the fish gave no quarter . Mr. Cater was dead by the time he was pulled clear of the water . The deaths were the second and third to be caused by shark attack off Amity in the past five days . Last Wednesday night , Miss Christine Watkins , a guest of Mr. and Mrs. John Foote of Old Mill Road , went for a swim and vanished . Thursday morning , Police Chief Martin Brody and Officer Hendricks recovered her body . According to coroner Carl Santos , the cause of death was " definitely and incontrovertiblyshark attack . " Asked why the cause of death was not made public , Mr. Santos declined to comment . Brody looked up from the paper and said , " Did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He said nobody but you and I had asked him about the cause of death , so he did n't feel compelled to tell anybody . As you can see , I could n't print that response . It would have pinned everything on you and me . I had hoped I could get him to say something like , Her family requested that the cause of death be kept private , and since there was obviously no crime involved , I agreed , ' but he would n't . I ca n't say I blame him . " " So what did you do ? " " I tried to get hold of Larry Vaughan , but he was away for the weekend . I thought he 'd be the best official spokes-man. "  | " And when you could n't reach him ? " " Read . " It was understood , however , that Amity police and governmentofficials had decided to withhold the information in the public interest . " People tend to overreact when they hear about a shark attack , " said one member of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start a panic . And we had an expert 's opinion that the odds against another attack were astronomical . " " Who was your talkative selectman ? " asked Brody . " All of them and none of them , " said Meadows . " It 's basicallywhat they all said , but none of them would be quoted . " " What about the beaches not being closed ? Did you gointo that ? " " You did . " " I did ? " Asked why he had not ordered the beaches closed until the marauding shark was apprehended , Chief Brody said , " The Atlantic Ocean is huge . Fish swim in it and move from place to place . They do n't always stay in one area , especially an area like this where there is no food source . What were we going to do ? Close the Amity beaches , and people would just drive up to East Hampton and go swimming there . And there 's just as good a chance that they 'd get killed in East Hampton as in Amity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brody did order the beaches closed until further notice . " Jesus , Harry , " said Brody , " you really put it to me . You 've got me arguing a case I do n't believe , then being proved wrong and forced to do what I wanted to do all along . That 's a pretty shitty trick . "  | " It was n't a trick . I had to have someone give the official line , and with Vaughan away , you were the logical one . You admit that you agreed to go along with the decision , so  --  reluctantlyor not  --  you supported it . I did n't see any point in airing all the dirty laundry of private disputes . " " I suppose . Anyway , it 's done . Is there anything else I should read in this ? " " No . I just quote Matt Hooper , that fellow from Woods Hole . He says it would be remarkable if we ever have another attack . But he 's a little less sure than he was last time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this ? " " He does n't know , of course , but offhand , yes . He thinks it 's a big white . " " I do , too . I mean , I do n't know from whites or greens or blues , but I think it 's one shark . " " Why ? " " I 'm not sure , exactly . Yesterday afternoon I called the Coast Guard out on Montauk . I asked them if they 'd noticed a lot of sharks around here recently , and they said they had n't seen a one . Not one so far this spring . It 's still early , so that is n't too strange . They said they 'd send a boat down this way later on and give me a call if they saw anything . I finally called them back . They said they had cruised up and down this area for two hours and had n't seen a thing . So there sure are n't many sharks around . They also said that when there are sharks around , they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and sand sharks that do n't generally bother people . From what Leonard said he saw yesterday , this is no medium-sized blue . " " Hooper said there was one thing we could do , " Meadowssaid . " Now that you 've got the beaches closed down , we could chum . You know , spread fish guts and goodies like thatp74around in the water . If there 's a shark around , he said , that will bring him running . " " Oh , great . That 's what we need , to attract sharks . And what if he shows up ? What do we do then ? " " Catch him . " " With what ? My trusty spinning rod ? " " No , a harpoon . " " A harpoon . Harry , I do n't even have a police boat , let alone a boat with harpoons on it . " " There are fishermen around . They have boats . " " Yeah , for a hundred and a half a day , or whatever it is . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . " A commotion out in the hall stopped Meadows in mid-sentence . He and Brody heard Bixby say , " I told you , ma'am , he 's in conference . " Then a woman 's voice said , " Bullshit ! I do n't care what he 's doing . I 'm going in there . " The sound of running feet  --  first one pair , then two . The door to Brody 's office flew open , and standing in the doorway , clutching a newspaper , tears streaming down her face , was Alexander Kintner 's mother . Bixby came up behind her and said , " I 'm sorry , Chief . I tried to stop her . " " That 's okay , Bixby , " said Brody . " Come in , Mrs. Kintner . Meadows stood and offered her his chair , which was the closest one to Brody 's desk . She ignored him and walked up to Brody , who was standing behind his desk . " What can I do ... " The woman slapped the newspaper across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as startle him  --  especially the noise , a sharp report that rang deep into his left ear . The paper fell to the floor.  | " What about this ? " Mrs. Kintner screamed . " What about it ? " " What about what ? " said Brody . " What they say here . That you knew it was dangerous to swim . That somebody had already been killed by that shark . That you kept it a secret . " Brody did n't know what to say . Of course it was true , all of it , at least technically . He could n't deny it . And yet he could n't admit it , either , because it was n't the whole truth . " Sort of , " he said . " I mean yes , it 's true , but it 's  --  look , Mrs. Kintner . . . " He was pleading with her to control herself until he could explain . " You killed Alex ! " She shrieked the words , and Brody was sure they were heard in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ center of town , on the beaches , all over Amity . He was sure his wife heard them , and his children . He thought to himself : Stop her before she says anything else . But all he could say was , " Ssshhh ! " " You did ! You killed him ! " Her fists were clenched at her sides , and her head snapped forward as she screamed , as if she were trying to inject the words into Brody . " You wo n't get away with it ! " " Please , Mrs. Kintner , " said Brody . " Calm down . Just for a minute . Let me explain . " He reached to touch her shoulder and help her to a chair , but she jerked away . " Keep your fucking hands off me ! " she cried . " You knew . You knew all along , but you would n't say . And now a sixyear-oldboy , a beautiful six-year-old boy , my boy ... " Tears seemed to pulse from her eyes , and as she quivered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You knew ! Why did n't you tell ? Why ? " She clutched herself , wrapping her arms around her body as they would be wrapped in a straitjacket , and she looked into Brody 's eyes . " Why ? "  | " It 's . . . " " Brody fumbled for words . " It 's a long story . " He felt wounded , incapacitated as surely as if he had been shot . He did n't know if he could explain now . He was n't even sure he could speak . " I bet it is , " said the woman . " Oh , you evil man . You evil , evil man . You . . . " " Stop it ! " Brody 's shout was both plea and command . It stopped her . " Now look , Mrs. Kintner , you 've got it wrong , all wrong . Ask Mr. Meadows . " Meadows , transfixed by the scene , nodded dumbly . " Of course he 'd say that . Why should n't he ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably told you you were doing the right thing . " Her rage was mounting again , flooding , resuscitated by a new burst of emotional amperage . " You probably decidedtogether . That makes it easier , does n't it ? Did you make money ? " " What ? " " Did you make money from my son 's blood ? Did someone pay you not to tell what you knew ? " Brody was horrified . " No ! Christ , of course not . " " Then why ? Tell me . Tell me why . I 'll pay you . Just tell me why ! " " Because we did n't think it could happen again . " Brody was surprised by his brevity . That was it , really , was n't it ? The woman was silent for a moment , letting the words register in her muddled mind . She seemed to repeat them to herself . She said , " Oh , " then , a second later , " Jesus . " All of a sudden , as if a switch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she had no more self-control . She slumped into the chair next to Meadows and began to weep in gasping , choking sobs . Meadows tried to calm her , but she did n't hear him . She did n't hear Brody when he told Bixby to call a doctor . Andp77she saw , heard , and felt nothing when the doctor came into the office , listened to Brody 's description of what had happened , tried to talk to her , gave her a shot of Librium , led her  --  with the help of one of Brody 's men  --  to his car , and drove her to the hospital . When she had left , Brody looked at his watch and said , " It 's not even nine o'clock yet . If ever I felt like I could use a drink . . . wow . " " If you 're serious , " said Meadows , " I have some Bourbon back in my office . " No . If this was any indication of how the rest of the day 's going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " It 's hard , but you 've got to try not to take what she said too seriously . I mean , the woman was in shock , for one thing . " " I know , Harry . Any doctor would say she did n't know what she was saying . The trouble is , I 'd already thought a lot of the things she was saying . Not in those words , maybe , but the thoughts were the same . " " Come on , Martin , you know you ca n't blame yourself . " " I know . I could blame Larry Vaughan . Or maybe even you . But the point is , the two deaths yesterday could have been prevented . I could have prevented them , and I did n't . Period . " The phone rang . It was answered in the other room , and a voice on the intercom said , " It 's Mr. Vaughan . " Brody pushed the lighted button , picked up the receiver , and said , " Hi , Larry . Did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eleven o'clock last night , " said Vaughan , " when I turned on my car radio driving home . I was tempted to call you last night , but I figured you had had a rough enough day without being bothered at that hour . " " That 's one decision I agree with . "  | " Do n't rub it in , Martin . I feel bad enough . " Brody wanted to say , " Do you , Larry ? " He wanted to scrape the wound raw , to unload some of the anguish onto someone else . But he knew it was both unfair to attempt and impossible to accomplish , so all he said was , " Sure . " " I had two cancellations already this morning . Big leases . Good people . They had already signed , and I told them I could take them to court . They said , go ahead : we 're going somewhere else . I 'm scared to answer the phone . I still have twenty houses that are n't rented for August . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it 's going to get worse . " " What do you mean ? " " With the beaches closed . " " How long do you think you 'll have to keep them closed ? " " I do n't know . As long as it takes . A few days . Maybe more . " " You know that the end of next week is the Fourth of July weekend . " " Sure , I know . " " It 's already too late to hope for a good summer , but we may be able to salvage something  --  for August , at least  --  if the Fourth is good . " Brody could n't read the tone in Vaughan 's voice . " Are you arguing with me , Larry ? " " No . I guess I was thinking out loud . Or praying out loud . Anyway , you plan to keep the beaches closed until what ? Indefinitely ? How will you know when that thing 's gone away ? " " I have n't had time to think that far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . Let me ask you something , Larry . Just out of curiosity . " " What ? "  | " Who are your partners ? " It was a long moment before Vaughan said , " Why do you want to know ? What does that have to do with anything ? " " Like I said , just curiosity . " " You keep your curiosity for your job , Martin . Let me worry about my business . " " Sure , Larry . No offense . " " So what are you going to do ? We ca n't just sit around and hope it will go away . We could starve to death while we waited . " " I know . Meadows and I were just talking about our options . A fish-expert friend of Harry 's says we could try to catch the fish . What would you think about getting up a couple of hundred dollars to charter Ben Gardner 's boat for a day or two ? I do n't know that he 's ever caught any sharks , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth a try , just so we get rid of that thing and go back to making a living . Go ahead . Tell him I 'll get the money from somewhere . " Brody hung up the phone and said to Meadows , " I do n't know why I care , but I 'd give my ass to know more about Mr. Vaughan 's business affairs . " ' Why ? " " He 's a very rich man . No matter how long this shark thing goes on , he wo n't be badly hurt . Sure , he 'll lose a little dough , but he 's taking all this as if it was life and death  --  and I do n't mean just the town 's . His . " " Maybe he 's just a conscientious fellow . " " That was n't conscience talking on the phone just then . Believe me , Harry . I know what conscience is . " Ten miles south of the eastern tip of Long Island , a charteredfishing boat drifted slowly in the tide . Two wire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the boat , a tall , spare man , sat on a bench on the flying bridge , staring at the water . Below , in the cockpit , the two men who had chartered the boat sat reading . One was reading a novel , the other the New York Times . " Hey , Quint , " said the man with the newspaper , " did you see this about the shark that killed those people ? " " I seen it , " said the captain . " You think we 'll run into that shark ? " " Nope . " " How do you know ? " " I know . " " Suppose we went looking for him . " " We wo n't . " " Why not ? " ' We got a slick goin ' . We 'll stay put . " The man shook his head and smiled . " Boy , would n't that be some sport . " " Fish like that ai n't sport , " said the captain . " How far is Amity from here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well , if he 's around here somewhere , you might run into him one of these days . " " We 'll find one another , all right . But not today . "  |p81Thursday  morning was foggy  --  a wet ground fog so thick that it had a taste : sharp and salty . People drove under the speed limit , with their lights on . Around midday , the fog lifted , and puffy cumulus clouds maundered across the sky beneath a high blanket of cirrus . By five in the afternoon , the cloud cover had begun to disintegrate , like pieces fallen from a jigsaw puzzle . Sunlight streaked through the gaps , stabbing shining patches of blue onto the gray-green surfaceof the sea . Brody sat on the public beach , his elbows resting on his knees to steady the binoculars in his hands . When he loweredthe glasses , he could barely see the boat  --  a white speck that disappeared and reappeared in the ocean swells . The strong lenses drew it into plain , though jiggly , view . Brody had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to push his eyes , to extend his vision from within to delineate more clearly the outline of what he saw . He cursed and let the glasses drop and hang by the strap around his neck . " Hey , Chief , " Hendricks said , walking up to Brody . " Hey , Leonard . What are you doing here ? " " I was just passing by and I saw your car . What are you doing ? "  | " Trying to figure out what the hell Ben Gardner 's doing . " " Fishing , do n't you think ? " " That 's what he 's being paid to do , but it 's the damnedest fishing I ever saw . I 've been here an hour , and I have n't seen anything move on that boat . " " Can I take a look ? " Brody handed him the glasses . Hendricksraised them and looked out to sea . " Nope , you 're right . How long has he been out there ? " " All day , I think . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'd be taking off at six this morning . " " Did he go alone ? " " I do n't know . He said he was going to try to get hold of his mate  --  Danny what's-his-name  --  but there was something about a dentist appointment . I hope to hell he did n't go alone . " " You want to go see ? We 've got at least two more hours of daylight . " " How do you plan to get out there ? " " I 'll borrow Chickering 's boat . He 's got an AquaSport with an eighty-horse Evinrude on it . That 'll get us out there . " Brody felt a shimmy of fear skitter up his back . He was a very poor swimmer , and the prospect of being on top of  --  let alone in  --  water above his head gave him what his mother used to call the wimwams : sweaty palms , a persistent need to swallow , and an ache in his stomach  --  essentially the sensationsome people feel about flying . In Brody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ savage things that rose from below and shredded his flesh , by demons that cackled and moaned . " Okay , " he said . " I do n't guess we 've got much choice . Maybe by the time we get to the dock he 'll already have started in . You go get the boat ready . I 'll stop off at headquarters and give his wife a call . . . see if he 's called in on the radio . "  |p83Amity  's town dock was small , with only twenty slips , a fuel dock , and a wooden shack where hot dogs and fried clams were sold in cardboard sleeves . The slips were in a little inlet protected from the open sea by a stone jetty that ran across half the width of the inlet 's mouth . Hendricks was standing in the AquaSport , the engine running , and he was chatting with a man in a twenty-five-foot cabin cruiser tied up in the neighboring slip . Brody walked along the wooden pier and climbed down the short ladder into the boat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Not a word . She 's been trying to raise him for half an hour , but she figures he must have turned off the radio . " " Is he alone ? " " As far as she knows . His mate had an impacted wisdom tooth that had to be taken out today . " The man in the cabin cruiser said , " If you do n't mind my saying so , that 's pretty strange . " " What is ? " said Brody . " To turn off your radio when you 're out alone . People do n't do that . " " I do n't know . Ben always bitches about all the chatter that goes on between boats when he 's out fishing . Maybe he got bored and turned it off . " " Maybe . " " Let 's go , Leonard , " said Brody . " Do you know how to drive this thing ? " Hendricks cast off the bow line , walked to the stern , uncleatedthe stern line , and tossed it onto the deck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knobbed handle forward . The boat lurched ahead , chugging . Hendricks pushed the handle farther forward , and the engine fired more regularly . The stern settled back , the bow rose . Asp84they made the turn around the jetty , Hendricks pushed the lever all the way forward , and the bow dropped down . " Planing , " said Hendricks . Brody grabbed a steel handle on the side of the console . " Are there any life jackets ? " he asked . " Just the cushions , " said Hendricks . " They 'd hold you up all right , if you were an eight-year-old boy . " " Thanks . " What breeze there had been had died , and there was little chop to the sea . But there were small swells , and the boat took them roughly , smacking its wooden prow into each one , recovering with a shudder that unnerved Brody . " This thing 's gon na break apart if you do n't slow down , " he said . Hendricks smiled , relishing his moment of command . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we 'll wallow . It 'll take us a week to get out there , and your stomach will feel like it 's full of squirrels . " Gardner 's boat was about three quarters of a mile from shore . As they drew nearer , Brody could see it bobbing gentlyin the swells . He could even make out the black letters on the transom : FLICKA . " He 's anchored , " said Hendricks . " Boy , that 's some lot of water to anchor a boat in . We must have more than a hundred feet out here . " " Swell , " Brody said . " That 's just what I wanted to hear . " When they were about fifty yards from the Flicka , Hendricksthrottled down , and the boat settled into a slow sideto-sideroll . They closed quickly . Brody walked forward and mounted a platform in the bow . He saw no signs of life . There were no rods in the rod-holders . " Hey , Ben ! " he called . There was no reply . " Maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , " Hey , Ben ! " The bow of the Aqua/Sport was only a few feet from the port quarter of the Flicka . Hendricks pushed the handle into neutral , then gave it a quick burst of reverse . The AquaSport stopped and , on the next swell , nestled up against the Flicka 's gunwale . Brody grabbed the gunwale . " Hey , Ben ! " Hendricks took a line from the lazaret , walked forward , and made it fast to a cleat on the bow of the AquaSport . He looped the line over the railing of the other boat and tied a crude knot . " You want to go on board ? " he said . " Yeah . " Brody climbed aboard the Flicka . Hendricks followed , and they stood in the cockpit . Hendricks poked his head through the forward hatch . " You in there , Ben ? " He looked around , withdrew his head , and said , " Not there . " " He 's not on board , " said Brody . " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuff ? " said Hendricks , pointing to a bucket in the corner of the stern . Brody walked to the bucket and bent down . A stench of fish and oil filled his nose . The bucket was full of guts and blood . " Must be chum , " he said . " Fish guts and other shit . You spread it around in the water and it 's supposed to attractsharks . He did n't use much of it . The bucket 's almost full . " A sudden noise made Brody jump . " Whiskey , zebra , echo , two , five , Hiner , " said a voice crackling over the radio . " This is the Pretty Belle . You there , Jake ? " " So much for that theory , " said Brody . " He never turned off his radio . " " I do n't get it , Chief . There are no rods . He did n't carry a dinghy , so he could n't have rowed away . He swam like a fish , so if he fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You see a harpoon anywhere ? " " What 's it look like ? "  | " I do n't know . Like a harpoon . And barrels . Supposedly , you use them as floats . " " I do n't see anything like that . " Brody stood at the starboard gunwale , gazing into the middle distance . The boat moved slightly , and he steadied himself with his right hand . He felt something strange and looked down . There were four ragged screw holes where a cleat had been . The screws had obviously not been removed by a screwdriver ; the wood around the holes was torn . " Look at this , Leonard . " Hendricks ran his hand over the holes . He looked to the port side , where a ten-inch steel cleat still sat securely on the wood . " You imagine that what was here was as big as the one over there ? " he said . " Jesus , what would it take to pull that mother out ? " " Look here , Leonard . " Brody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gunwale . There was a scar about eight inches long , where the paint had been scraped away and the wood abraded . " It looks like someone took a file to this wood . " " Or else rubbed the hell out of it with an awful tight piece of heavy rope . " Brody walked over to the port side of the cockpit and , aimlessly , began to feel his way along the outer edge of the gunwale . " That 's the only place , " he said . When he reached the stern , he leaned on the gunwale and gazed down into the water . For a moment , he stared dumbly at the transom , unseeing . Then a pattern began to take shape , a pattern of holes , deep gouges in the wooden transom , forming a rough semicircle more than three feet across . Next to it was another , similar pattern . And at the bottom of the transom , just at the waterp87line , three short smears of blood . Please , God , thought Brody , not another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . Hendricks walked to the stern and looked over . " What ? " " If I hold your legs , you think you can lean over and take a look at those holes down there and try to figure out what made them ? " " What do you think made them ? " " I do n't know . But something . I want to find out what . Come on . If you ca n't dope it out in a minute or two , we 'll forget about it and go home . Okay ? " " I guess so . " Hendricks lay on the top of the transom . " Hold me tight , Chief . . . please . " Brody leaned down and grabbed Hendricks ' feet . " Do n't worry , " he said . He took one of Hendricks ' legs under each arm and lifted . Hendricks rose , then bent over the transom . " Okay ? " said Brody . " A little more . Not too much ! Jesus , you just dipped my head in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Okay , that 's it . " Hendricks began to examine the holes . " What if some shark came along right now ? " he grunted . " He could grab me right out of your hands . " " Do n't think about it . Just look . " " I 'm looking . " In a few moments he said , " Sonofabitch . Look at that thing . Hey , pull me up . I need my knife . " " What is it ? " Brody asked when Hendricks was back aboard . Hendricks unfolded the main blade from the body of his pocket knife . " I do n't know , " he replied . " Some kind of white chip or something , stuck into one of the holes . " Knife in hand , he allowed Brody to lower him over the rail again . He worked briefly , his body twisting from the effort . Then he called : " Okay . I 've got it . Pull . "  |p88Brody  stepped backward , hoisting Hendricks over the transom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Let 's see , " he said , holding out his hand . Into Brody 's palm Hendricksdropped a triangle of glistening white denticle . It was nearly two inches long . The sides were tiny saws . Brody scraped the tooth against the gunwale , and it cut the wood . He looked out over the water and shook his head . " My God , " he said . " It 's a tooth , is n't it ? " said Hendricks . " Jesus Christ Almighty . You think the shark got Ben ? " " I do n't know what else to think , " said Brody . He looked at the tooth again , then dropped it into his pocket . " We might as well go . There 's nothing we can do here . " " " What do you want to do with Ben 's boat ? " " We 'll leave it here till tomorrow . Then we 'll have someonecome get it . " " I 'll drive it back if you want . " " And leave me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We could tow one of them in . " " No . It 's getting dark , and I do n't want to have to fool around trying to dock two boats in the dark . This boat 'll be all right overnight . Just go check the anchor up front and make sure it 's secure . Then let 's go . No one 's going to need this boat before tomorrow . . . especially not Ben Gardner . " They arrived at the dock in late twilight . Harry Meadows and another man , unknown to Brody , were waiting for them . " You sure have good antenna , Harry , " Brody said as he climbed the ladder onto the dock . Meadows smiled , flattered . " That 's my trade , Martin . " He gestured toward the man beside him . " This is Matt Hooper , Chief Brody . " The two men shook hands . " You 're the fellow from Woods Hole , " Brody said , trying to get a good look at him in thep89fading light . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : tanned , hair bleached by the sun . He was about as tall as Brody , an inch over six feet , but leaner : Brody guessed 170 pounds , compared to his own 200 . A mental reflex scanned Hooper for possible threat . Then , with what Brody recognized as juvenile pride , he determined that if it ever came to a face-off , he could take Hooper . Experiencewould make the difference . " That 's right , " said Hooper . " Harry 's been tapping your brain long-distance , " Brody said . " How come you 're here ? " Meadows said , " I called him . I thought he might be able to figure out what 's going on . " " Shit , Harry , all you had to do was ask me , " said Brody . " I could have told you . You see , there 's this fish out there , and . . . " " You know what I mean . " Brody sensed his own resentment at the intrusion , the complication that Hooper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of authority that Hooper 's arrival had created . And he recognized the resentment as stupid . " Sure , Harry , " he said . " No problem . It 's just been a long day . " " What did you find out there ? " Meadows asked . Brody started to reach in his pocket for the tooth , but he stopped . He did n't want to go through it all , standing on a dock in near darkness . " I 'm not sure , " he said . " Come on back to the station and I 'll fill you in . " " Is Ben going to stay out there all night ? " " It looks that way , Harry . " Brody turned to Hendricks , who had finished tying up the boat . " You going home , Leonard ? " " Yeah . I want to clean up before I go to work . " Brody arrived at police headquarters before Meadows andp90Hooper . It was almost eight o'clock . He had two phone calls to make  --  to Ellen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he should pick up something on the way home , and , the call he dreaded , to Sally Gardner . He called Ellen first : pot roast . It could be reheated . It might taste like a sneaker , but it would be warm . He hung up , checked the phone book for the Gardner number , and dialed it . " Sally ? This is Martin Brody . " Suddenly he regretted havingcalled without thinking the call through . How much should he tell her ? Not much , he decided , at least not until he had had a chance to check with Hooper to see if his theorywas plausible or absurd . " Where 's Ben , Martin ? " The voice was calm , but pitched slightly higher than Brody remembered as normal . " I do n't know , Sally . " " What do you mean , you do n't know ? You went out there , did n't you ? " " Yes . He was n't on the boat . " " But the boat was there . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on board ? You looked all over it ? Even below ? "  --  Yes . " Then a tiny hope . " Ben did n't carry a dinghy , did he ? " " No . How could he not be there ? " The voice was shriller now. . .  --  " Where is he ? " Brody caught the tone of incipient hysteria . He wished he had gone to the house in person . " Are you alone , Sally ? " " No . The kids are here . " She seemed calmer , but Brody was sure the calm was a lull before the burst of grief that would come when she realized that the fears with which she had lived every dayp91for the sixteen years Ben had been fishing professionally  --  closet fears shoved into mental recesses and never uttered because they would seem ridiculous  --  had come true . Brody dug at his memory for the ages of the Gardner children . Twelve , maybe ; then nine , then about six . What kind of kid was the twelve-year-old ? He did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Why did n't he think of this before ? The Finleys . " Just a second , Sally . " He called to the officer at the front desk . " Clements , call Grace Finley and tell her to get her ass over to Sally Gardner 's house right now . " " Suppose she asks why . " " Just tell her I said to go . Tell her I 'll explain later . " He turned back to the phone . " I 'm sorry , Sally . All I can tell you for sure is that we went out to where Ben 's boat is anchored . We went on board and Ben was n't there . We looked all around , downstairs and everything . " Meadows and Hooper walked into Brody 's office . He motionedthem to chairs . " But where could he be ? " said Sally Gardner . " You do n't just get off a boat in the middle of the ocean . " " No . " " And he could n't have fallen overboard . I mean , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in again . " " Yes . " " Maybe someone came and took him off in another boat . Maybe the engine would n't start and he had to ride with someone else . Did you check the engine ? " " No , " Brody said , embarrassed . " That 's probably it , then . " The voice was subtly lighter , almost girlish , coated with a veneer of hope that , when it broke , would shatter like iced crystal . " And if the battery was dead , that would explain why he could n't call on the radio . " " The radio was working , Sally . "  | " Wait a minute . Who 's there ? Oh , it 's you . " There was a pause . Brody heard Sally talking to Grace Finley . Then Sally came back on the line . " Grace says you told her to come over here . Why ? " " I thought  --  " " You think he 's dead , do n't you ? You think he drowned . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm afraid so , Sally . That 's all we can think at the moment . Let me talk to Grace for a minute , will you please ? " A couple of seconds later , the voice of Grace Finley said , " Yes , Martin ? " " I 'm sorry to do this to you , but I could n't think of anything else . Can you stay with her for a while ? " " All night . I will . " " That might be a good idea . I 'll try to get over later on . Thanks . " " What happened , Martin ? " " We do n't know for sure . " " Is it that ... thing again ? " " Maybe . That 's what we 're trying to figure out . But do me a favor , Grace . Do n't say anything about a shark to Sally . It 's bad enough as it is . " " All right , Martin . Wait . Wait a minute . " She covered the mouthpiece of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conversation . Then Sally Gardner came on the line . " Why did you do it , Martin ? " " Do what ? " Apparently , Grace Finley tried to take the phone from her hand , for Brody heard Sally say , " Let me speak , damn you ! " Then she said to him , " Why did you send him ? Why Ben ? " Her voice was n't particularly loud , but she spoke with an intensitythat struck Brody as hard as if she were yelling.  | " Sally , you 're  --  " " This did n't have to happen ! " she said . " You could have stopped it . " Brody wanted to hang up . He did n't want a repetition of the scene with the Kintner boy 's mother . But he had to defend himself . She had to know that it was n't his fault . How could she blame him ? He said , " Crap ! Ben was a fisherman , a good one . He knew the risks . " " If you had n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let himself stamp on her words . " Try to get some rest . " He hung up the phone . He was furious , but his fury was confused . He was angry at Sally Gardnerfor accusing him , and angry at himself for being angry at her . If , she had said . If what ? If he had not sent Ben . Sure . And if pigs had wings they 'd be eagles . If he had gone himself . But that was n't his trade . He had sent the expert . He looked up at Meadows . " You heard . " " Not all of it . But enough to gather that Ben Gardner has become victim number four . " Brody nodded . " I think so . " He told Meadows and Hooper about his trip with Hendricks . Once or twice , Meadows interruptedwith a question . Hooper listened , his angular face placid and his eyes  --  a light , powder blue  --  fixed on Brody . At the end of his tale , Brody reached into his pants pocket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Leonard dug it out of the wood . " He flipped the tooth to Hooper , who turned it over in his hand . " What do you think , Matt ? " said Meadows . " It 's a white . " " How big ? " " I ca n't be sure , but big . Fifteen , twenty feet . That 's some fantastic fish . " He looked at Meadows . " Thanks for callingp94me , " he said . " I could spend a whole lifetime around sharks and never see a fish like that . " Brody asked , " How much would a fish like that weigh ? " " Five or six thousand pounds . " Brody whistled . " Three tons . " " Do you have any thoughts about what happened ? " Meadows asked . " From what the chief says , it sounds like the fish killed Mr. Gardner . " " How ? " said Brody . " Any number of ways . Gardner might have fallen overboard . More likely , he was pulled over . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He could even have been taken while he was leaning over the stern . " " How do you account for the teeth in the stern ? " " The fish attacked the boat . " " What the hell for ? " " Sharks are n't very bright , Chief . They exist on instinct and impulse . The impulse to feed is powerful . " " But a thirty-foot boat . . . " " A shark does n't think . To him it was n't a boat . It was just something large . " " And inedible . " " Not till he 'd tried it . You have to understand . There 's nothing in the sea this fish would fear . Other fish run from bigger things . That 's their instinct . But this fish does n't run from anything . He does n't know fear . He might be cautious  --  say around an even bigger white . But fear  --  no way . " " What else do they attack ? " " Anything . " " Just like that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Do you have any idea why he 's hung around here sop95long ? " said Brody . " I do n't know how much you know about the water here , but ... " " I grew up here . " " You did ? In Amity ? " " No , Southampton . I spent every summer there , from grade school through grad school . " " Every summer . So you did n't really grow up there . " Brody was groping for something with which to re-establishhis parity with , if not superiority to , the younger man , and what he settled for was reverse snobbism , an attitude not uncommon to year-round residents of resort communities . It gave them armor against the contempt they sensed radiating from the rich summer folk . It was an " I 'm all right , Jack " attitude , a social machismo that equated wealth with effeteness , simplicity with goodness , and poverty ( up to a point ) with honesty . And it was an attitude that , in general , Brody found both repugnant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ younger man  --  he was n't really sure why  --  and the sensationwas so alien that he had reached for the most convenientcarapace , the one Hooper had handed him . " You 're picking nits , " Hooper said testily . " Okay , so I was n't born here . But I 've spent a lot of time in these waters , and I wrote a paper on this coastline . Anyway , I know what you 're getting at , and you 're right . This shoreline is n't an environment that would normally support a long stay by a shark . " " So why is this one staying ? " " It 's impossible to say . It 's definitely uncharacteristic , but sharks do so many uncharacteristic things that the erratic becomes the normal . Anyone who 'd risk money  --  not to mentionhis life  --  on a prediction about what one big shark will do in a given situation is a fool . This shark could be sick . The patterns of his life are so beyond his control that damage top96one small mechanism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If this is how he acts when he 's sick , " said Brody , " I 'd hate to see what he does when he 's feeling fine . " " No . Personally , I do n't think he 's sick . There are other things that could cause him to stay here  --  many of them things we 'll never understand , natural factors , caprices . " " Like what ? " " Changes in water temperature or current flow or feeding patterns . As food supplies move , so do the predators . A few summers ago , for example , a completely inexplicable phenomenontook place off the shore of parts of Connecticut and Rhode Island . The whole coastline was suddenly inundated with menhaden  --  fishermen call them bunker . Huge schools . Millions of fish . They coated the water like an oil slick . There were so many that you could throw a bare hook in the waterand reel it in , and more often than not you 'd catch a menhaden by foul-hooking it . Bluefish and bass feed on menhaden , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeding in schools right off the beaches . In Watch Hill , Rhode Island , people were wading into the surf and catchingbluefish with rakes . Garden rakes ! Just shoveling the fish out of the water . Then the big predators came  --  big tuna , four , five , six hundred pounds . Deep-sea fishing boats were catching bluefin tuna within a hundred yards of the shore . In harbors sometimes . Then suddenly it stopped . The menhadenwent away , and so did the other fish . I spent three weeks down there trying to figure out what was going on . I still do n't know . It 's all part of the ecological balance . When something tips too far one way or the other , peculiar things happen . " " But this is even weirder , " said Brody . " This fish has stayed in one place , in one chunk of water only a mile or twop97square , for over a week . He has n't moved up or down the beach . He has n't touched anybody in East Hampton or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't know . I doubt that anyone could give you a good answer . " Meadows said , " Minnie Eldridge has the answer . " " Balls , " said Brody . " Who 's Minnie Eldridge ? " asked Hooper . " The postmistress , " said Brody . " She says it 's God 's will , or something like that . We 're being punished for our sins . " Hooper smiled . " Right now , anyway , that 's as good an answer as I 've got . " " That 's encouraging , " said Brody . " Is there anything you plan to do to get an answer ? " " There are a few things . I 'll take water samples here and in East Hampton . I 'll try to find out how other fish are behaving  --  ifanything extraordinary is around , or if anything that should be here is n't . And I 'll try to find that shark . Which reminds me , is there a boat available ? " " Yes , I 'm sorry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's . We 'll get you out to it tomorrow , and you can use it at least until we work something out with his wife . Do you really think you can catch that fish , after what happened to Ben Gard-ner ? " " I did n't say I was going to try to catch it . I do n't think I 'd want to try that . Not alone , anyway . " " Then what the hell are you going to do ? " " I do n't know . I 'll have to play it by ear . " Brody looked into Hooper 's eyes and said , " I want that fish killed . If you ca n't do it , we 'll find someone who can . " Hooper laughed . " You sound like a mobster . I want that fish killed . ' So go get a contract out on him . Who are you going to get to do the job ? "  | " I do n't know . What about it , Harry ? You 're supposed to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any fisherman on this whole damn island equipped to catch big sharks ? " Meadows thought for a moment before he spoke . " There may be one . I do n't know much about him , but I think his name is Quint , and I think he operates out of a private pier somewhere around Promised Land . I can find out a little more about him if you like . " " Why not ? " said Brody . " He sounds like a possible . " Hooper said , " Look , Chief , you ca n't go off half-cocked looking for vengeance against a fish . That shark is n't evil . It 's not a murderer . It 's just obeying its own instincts . Trying to get retribution against a fish is crazy . " " Listen you . . . " Brody was growing angry  --  an anger born of frustration and humiliation . He knew Hooper was right , but he felt that right and wrong were irrelevant to the situation . The fish was an enemy . It had come upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a child . The people of Amity would demand the death of the fish . They would need to see it dead before they could feel secure enough to resume their normal lives . Most of all , Brody needed it dead , for the death of the fish would be a catharsis for him . Hooper had touched that nerve , and that infuriated Brody further . But he swallowed his rage and said , " Forget it . " The phone rang . " It 's for you , Chief , " said Clements . " Mr. Vaughan . " " Oh swell . That 's just what I need . " He punched the flashingbutton on the phone and picked up the receiver . " Yeah , Larry . " " Hello , Martin . How are you ? " Vaughan 's voice wasp99friendly , almost effusively so . Brody thought , he 's probably had a couple of belts . " As well as could be expected , Larry . " " You 're working pretty late . I tried to get you at home . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chief of police and your constituentsare getting themselves killed every twenty minutes , that kind of keeps you busy . " " I heard about Ben Gardner . " " What did you hear ? " " That he was missing . " " News travels pretty fast . " " Are you sure it was the shark again ? " " Sure ? Yeah , I guess so . Nothing else seems to make any sense . " " Martin , what are you going to do ? " There was a pathetic urgency in Vaughan 's voice . " That 's a good question , Larry . We 're doing everything we can right now . We 've got the beaches closed down . We 've  --  " " I 'm aware of that , to say the very least . " " What 's that supposed to mean ? " " Have you ever tried to sell healthy people real estate in a leper colony ? " " No , Larry , " Brody said wearily . " I 'm getting cancellations every day . People are walking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customer in here since Sunday . " " So what do you want me to do ? " " Well , I thought . . . I mean , what I 'm wondering is , maybe we 're overreacting to this whole thing . " " You 're kidding . Tell me you 're kidding . " " Hardly , Martin . Now calm down . Let 's discuss this ra-tionally. "  | " I 'm rational . I 'm not sure about you , though . " There was a moment of silence , and then Vaughan said , " What would you say to opening the beaches , just for the Fourth of July weekend ? " " Not a chance . Not a fucking chance . " " Now listen . .. " " No , you listen , Larry . The last time I listened to you , we had two people killed . If we catch that fish , if we kill the sonofabitch , then we 'll open the beaches . Until then , forget it . " What about nets ? " " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steel nets out to protect the beaches ? Someone told me that 's what they do in Australia . " He must be drunk , Brody thought . " Larry , this is a straight coastline . Are you going to put nets out along two and a half miles of beaches ? Fine . You get the money . I 'd say about a million dollars , for openers . " " What about patrols ? We could hire people to patrol up and down the beaches in boats . " " That 's not good enough , Larry . What is it with you , anyway ? Are your partners on your ass again ? " " That 's none of your damn business , Martin . For God 's sake , man , this town is dying ! " " I know it , Larry , " Brody said softly . " And as far as I know , there 's not a damn thing we can do about it . Good night . " He hung up the phone . Meadows and Hooper rose to leave . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house . As they started out the door , Brody said to Meadows , " Hey , Harry , you left your lighter inside . " Meadows started to say something , but Brody stepped on his words . " Come on back inside and I'llp101give it to you . If you leave it around here overnight , it 's likely to disappear . " He waved to Hooper . " See you . " When they were back in Brody 's office , Meadows took his lighter from his pocket and said , " I trust you had something to say to me . " Brody shut the door to his office . " You think you can find out something about Larry 's partners ? " " I guess so . Why ? " " Ever since this thing began , Larry has been on my ass to keep the beaches open . And now , after all that 's just happened , he says he wants them open for the Fourth . The other day he said he was under pressure from his partners . I told you about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we should know who it is who has enough clout to drive Larry bullshit . I would n't care if he was n't the mayor of this town . But if there are people telling him what to do , I think we ought to know who they are . " Meadows sighed . " Okay , Martin . I 'll do what I can . But digging around in Larry Vaughan 's affairs is n't my idea of fun . " " There 's not a whole hell of a lot that is fun these days , is there ? " Brody walked Meadows to the door , then went back to his desk and sat down . Vaughan had been right about one thing , he thought : Amity was showing all the signs of imminent death . It was n't just the real estate market , though its sicknesswas as contagious as smallpox . Evelyn Bixby , the wife of one of Brody 's officers , had lost her job as a real estate agent and was working as a waitress in a hash house on Route 27 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next day had put off their debuts until July 3 , and the proprietorsp102of both made a point of calling on Brody to tell him that if the beaches were n't open by then , they would n't open their stores at all . One of them was already looking at a site for rent in East Hampton . The sporting goods store had posted signs announcing a clearance sale  --  a sale that normally took place over the Labor Day weekend . The only good thing about the Amity economy , as far as Brody was concerned , was that Saxon 's was doing so badly that it laid off Henry Kimble . Now that he did n't have his bartending job , he slept during the day and could occasionally survive through a shift of police work without a nap . Beginning on Monday morning  --  the first day the beaches were closed  --  Brody had posted two officers on the beaches . Together , they had had seventeen confrontations with people who insisted on swimming . One was with a man named Robert Dexter , who claimed a constitutional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his dog to terrorize the officer on duty , until the cop pulled his pistol and threatened to shoot the dog . Another dustup took place on the public beach , when a New York lawyer started reading the United States Constitution to a policeman and a multitude of cheering youths . Still , Brody was convinced that  --  so far , at least  --  no one had gone swimming . On Wednesday , two kids had rented a skiff and rowed about three hundred yards offshore , where they spent an hour ladling blood , chicken guts , and duck heads overboard . A passing fishing boat spotted them and called Brody via the marine operator . Brody called Hooper , and together they went in Flicka and towed the boys to shore . In the skiff the boys had a flying gaff attached to two hundred yards of clothesline , secured to the prow by a square knot . They said they planned to hook the shark with the gaff and go for a " Nantucket sleigh ride . " Brody told them that if they ever tried the stunt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There had been four reports of shark sightings . One had turned out to be a floating log . Two , according to the fishermanwho followed up the reports , were schools of jumping bait fish . And one , as far as anyone could tell , was a flat nothing . On Tuesday evening , just at dusk , Brody had received an anonymous phone call telling him that a man was dumping shark bait into the water off the public beach . It turned out to be not a man , but a woman dressed in a man 's raincoat  --  Jessie Parker , one of the clerks at Walden 's Stationery Store . At first she denied throwing anything into the water , but then she admitted that she had tossed a paper bag into the surf . It contained three empty vermouth bottles . " Why did n't you throw them in the garbage ? " Brody had asked . " I did n't want the garbage man to think I 'm a heavy drinker . " " Then why did n't you throw them in someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nice , " she said . " Garbage is . . . sort of private , do n't you think ? " Brody told her that from now on , she should take her empty bottles , put them in a plastic bag , put that bag in a brown paper bag , then smash the bottles with a hammer until they were ground up . Nobody would ever know they had been bottles . Brody looked at his watch . It was after nine , too late to pay a visit to Sally Gardner . He hoped she was asleep . Maybe Grace Finley had given her a pill or a glass of whiskey to help her rest . Before he left the office , he called the Coastp104Guard station at Montauk and told the duty officer about Ben Gardner . The officer said he would dispatch a patrol boat at first light to search for the body . " Thanks , " said Brody . " I hope you find it before it washes up . " Brody was suddenly appalled at himself . " It " was Ben Gardner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard Brody refer to her husband as " it " ? Fifteen years of friendship wiped out , forgotten . There was no more Ben Gardner . There was only an " it " that should be found before it became a gory nuisance . " We 'll try , " said the officer . " Boy , I feel for you guys . You must be having a hell of a summer . " " I only hope it is n't our last , " said Brody . He hung up , turned out the light in his office , and walked out to his car . As he turned into his driveway , Brody saw the familiar blue-gray light shining from the living room windows . The boys were watching television . He walked through the front door , flipped off the outside light , and poked his head into the dark living room . The oldest boy , Billy , lay on the couch , leaning on an elbow . Martin , the middle son , age twelve , lounged in an easy chair , his shoeless feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the floor , his back against the couch , stroking a cat in his lap . " How goes it ? " said Brody . " Good , Dad , " said Bill , without shifting his gaze from the television . " Where 's your mom ? " " Upstairs . She said to tell you your dinner 's in the kitchen . " " Okay . Not too late , Sean , huh ? It 's almost nine-thirty . " " Okay , Dad , " said Sean . Brody went into the kitchen , opened the refrigerator , and took out a beer . The remains of the pot roast sat on thep105kitchen table in a roasting pan , surrounded by a scum of congealed gravy . The meat was brownish-gray and stringy . " Dinner ? " said Brody to himself . He checked the icebox for sandwich makings . There was some hamburger , a package of chicken legs , a dozen eggs , a jar of pickles , and twelve cans of soda pop . He found a piece of American cheese , dried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popped it into his mouth . He debated heating up the pot roast , then said aloud , " The hell with it . " He found two pieces of bread , spread mustard on them , took a carving knife from a magneticboard on the wall , and sliced a thick slab of roast . He dropped the meat on one of the pieces of bread , scattered a few pickles on top of it , covered it with the other piece of bread , and mashed the sandwich down with the heel of his hand . He put it on a plate , picked up his beer , and climbed the stairs to his bedroom . Ellen was sitting up in bed , reading Cosmopolitan . " Hello , " she said . " A tough day ? You did n't say anything on the phone . " " A tough day . That 's about all we 're having these days . You heard about Ben Gardner ? I was n't really positive when I talked to you . " He put the plate and the beer on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to remove his shoes . " Yes . I got a call from Grace Finley asking if I knew where Dr. Craig was . His service would n't say , and Grace wanted to give Sally a sedative . " " Did you find him ? " " No . But I had one of the boys take some Seconol over to her . " " What 's Seconol ? " " Sleeping pills . " " I did n't know you were taking sleeping pills . " " I do n't , often . Just every now and then . "  | " Where did you get them ? " " From Dr. Craig , when I went to him last time about my nerves . I told you . " " Oh . " Brody tossed his shoes into a corner , stood up , and took off his trousers , which he folded neatly over the back of a chair . He took off his shirt , put it on a hanger , and hung it in the closet . In T-shirt and undershorts he sat down on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meat was dry and flaky . All he could taste was mustard . " Did n't you find the roast ? " said Ellen . Brody 's mouth was full , so he nodded . " What 's that you 're eating , then ? " He swallowed . " The roast . " " Did you heat it up ? " " No . I do n't mind it like this . " Ellen made a face and said , " Yech . " Brody ate in silence , as Ellen aimlessly turned the pages of her magazine . After a few moments , she closxd the magazine , put it in her lap , and said , " Oh dear . " " What 's the matter ? " " I was just thinking about Ben Gardner . It 's so horrible . What do you think Sally will do ? " " I do n't know , " said Brody . " I worry about her . Have you ever talked money with her ? " " Never . But there ca n't be much . I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and she 's always saying that she 'd give anything to be able to afford meat more than once a week , instead of having to eat the fish Ben catches . Will she get social security ? " " I 'd think so , but it wo n't amount to much . There 's wel-fare . " " Oh , she could n't , " said Ellen.  | " You wait . Pride is something she wo n't be able to afford . Now there wo n't even be the fish any more . " " Is there anything we can do ? " " Personally ? I do n't see how . We 're not exactly in fat city ourselves . But there may be something the town can do . I 'll talk to Vaughan about it . " " Have you made any progress ? " " You mean about catching that damn thing ? No . Meadows called that oceanographer friend of his down from Woods Hole , so he 's here . Not that I see what good he 's going to do . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all right , I guess . He 's young , a decent-looking guy . He 's a bit of a know-it-all , but that 's not surprising . He seems to know the area pretty well . " " Oh ? How so ? " " He said he was a summer kid in Southampton . Spent all his summers there . " " Working ? " " I do n't know , living with the parents probably . He looks to be the type . " " What type ? " " Rich . Good family . The Southampton summer type . You ought to know it , for God 's sake . " " " Do n't get angry . I was just asking . " " I 'm not angry . I just said you ought to know the type , that 's all . I mean , you 're the type yourself . " " Ellen smiled . " I used to be . But now I 'm just an old lady . " " That 's a crock , " Brody said . " Nine out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do what you can for a bathing suit . " He was happy to see her fishing for compliments , and happy to give them to her . This was one of their ritualp108preludes to sex , and the sight of Ellen in bed made Brody yearn for sex . Her hair hung down to her shoulders on both sides of her head , then tucked inward in a curl . Her nightgownwas cut so deeply in front that both her breasts were visible , all but the nipples , and was so diaphanous that Brody was sure he could actually see the dark flesh of the nipples . " I 'm going to brush my teeth , " he said . " I 'll be right back . " When he returned from the bathroom , he was tumescent . He walked to the dresser to turn out the light . " You know , " Ellen said , " I think we should give the boys tennis lessons . " " What for ? Have they said they want to play tennis ? " " No . Not in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for them to know . It will help them when they 're grown-up . It 's an entree . " " To what ? " " To the people they should know . If you play tennis well , you can walk into a club anywhere and get to know people . Now 's the time they should be learning . " " Where are they going to get lessons ? " " I was thinking of the Field Club . " " As far as I know , we 're not members of the Field Club . " " I think we could get in . I still know a few people who are members . If I asked them , I 'll bet they 'd propose us . " " Forget it . " " Why ? " " Number one , we ca n't afford it . I bet it costs a thousand bucks to join , and then it 's at least a few hundred a year . We have n't got that kind of money . " " We have savings . " " Not for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let 's drop it . " He reached for the light.  | " It would be good for the boys . " Brody let his hand fall to the top of the dresser . " Look , we 're not tennis people . We would n't feel right there . I would n't feel right there . They do n't want us there . " " How do you know ? We 've never tried . " " Just forget it . " He switched off the light , walked over to the bed , pulled back the covers , and slid in beside Ellen . " Besides , " he said , nuzzling her neck , " there 's another sport I 'm better at . " " The boys are awake . " " They 're watching television . They would n't know it if a bomb went off up here . " He kissed her neck and began to rub his hand in circles on her stomach , moving higher with each rotation . Ellen yawned . " I 'm so sleepy , " she said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped rubbing . " What the hell for ? " " I did n't sleep well last night , and I did n't want to wake up if you came home late . So I took a pill . " " I 'm going to throw those goddam pills away . " He kissed her cheek , then tried to kiss her mouth but caught her in mid-yawn . " I 'm sorry , " she said . " I 'm afraid it wo n't work . " " It 'll work . All you have to do is help a little . " " I 'm so tired . But you go ahead if you want . I 'll try to stay awake . " " Shit , " said Brody . He rolled back to his side of the bed . " I 'm not very big on screwing corpses . " " That was uncalled-for . " Brody did n't reply . He lay on his back , staring at the ceilingand feeling his erection dwindle . But the pressure inside him was still there , a dull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " What 's Harry Meadows ' friend 's name ? " " Hooper . " " Not David Hooper . " " No . I think his name is Matt . " " Oh . I went out with a David Hooper a long , long time ago . I remember . . " Before she could finish the sentence , her eyes shut , and soon she slipped into the deep breathing of sleep . A few blocks away , in a small clapboard house , a black man sat at the foot of his son 's bed . " What story do you want to read ? " he said . " I do n't want to read a story , " said the boy , who was seven . " I want to tell a story . " " Okay . What 'll we tell one about ? " " A shark . Let 's tell one about a shark . " The man winced . " No . Let 's tell one about . . . a bear . " " No , a shark . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean a once-upon-a-time story ? " " Sure . Like , you know , once upon a time there was a shark that ate people . " " That 's not a very nice story . " " Why do sharks eat people ? " " I guess they get hungry . I do n't know . " " Do you bleed if a shark eats you ? " " Yes , " said the man . " Come on . Let 's tell a story about another kind of animal . You 'll have nightmares if we tell about a shark . " " No , I wo n't . If a shark tried to eat me , I 'd punch him in the nose . " " No shark is going to try to eat you . "  | " Why not ? If I go swimming I bet one would . Do n't sharks eat black people ? " " Now stop it ! I do n't want to hear any more about sharks . " The man lifted a pile of books from the bedside table . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her way home Friday noon , after a morning of volunteer work at the Southampton Hospital , Ellen stopped at the post office to buy a roll of stamps and get the mail . There was no home mail delivery in Amity . In theory , only special delivery mail was brought to the door  --  any door within a mile radius of the post office ; in fact , even special delivery mail ( except that clearly labeled as sent by the Federal Government ) was kept at the post office until someone called for it . The post office was a small , square building on Teal Street , just off Main . It had 500 mailboxes , 340 of which were rented to Amity 's permanent residents . The other 16o were allotted to summer people , according to the whims of the postmistress , Minnie Eldridge . Those people she liked were permitted to rent boxes for the summer . Those she did n't like had to wait in line at the counter . Since she refused to rent a box to any summer person on a year-round basis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next whether or not they would have a mailbox when they arrived in June . It was generally assumed that Minnie Eldridge was in her early seventies , and that she had somehow convinced the authorities in Washington that she was well under compulsoryretirement age . She was small and frail-looking , butp116deceptively strong , able to hustle packages and cartons nearly as quickly as the two young men who worked in the post office with her . She never spoke about her past or her private life . The only common knowledge about her was that she had been born on Nantucket Island and had left sometimesoon after World War I. She had been in Amity for as long as anyone living could remember , and she considered herself not only a native , but also the resident expert on the history of the town . She needed no prodding at all to embarkon a discourse about Amity 's eponym , a seventeenthcenturywoman named Amity Hopewell who had been convicted of witchcraft , and she took pleasure in reciting the list of major events in the town 's past : the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ill-fated attempt to outflank a Colonial force ( the Britons lost their way and wandered aimlessly back and forth across Long Island ) ; the fire in 1823 that destroyed every building except the town 's only church ; the wreck of a rumrunning ship in 1921 ( the ship was eventually refloated , but by then all the cargo offloadedto make the ship lighter had vanished ) ; the hurricaneof 1938 , and the widely reported ( though never fully ascertained ) landing of three German spies on the Scotch Road beach in 1942 . Ellen and Minnie made each other nervous . Ellen sensed that Minnie did n't like her , and she was right . Minnie felt uneasy with Ellen because she could n't catalogue her . Ellen was neither summer folk nor winter folk . She had n't earned her year-round mailbox , she had married it . Minnie was alone in the post office , sorting mail , when Ellen arrived . " Morning , Minnie , " Ellen said . Minnie looked up at the clock over the counter and said , " Afternoon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , please ? " Ellen put a fivedollarbill and three ones on the counter . Minnie pushed a few more letters into boxes , set down her bundle , and walked to the counter . She gave Ellen a roll of stamps and dropped the bills into a drawer . " What 's Martin think he 's going to do about that shark ? " she said . " I do n't know . I guess they 'll try to catch it . " " Canst thou draw out leviathan with a hook ? " " I beg your pardon ? " " Book of Job , " said Minnie . " No mortal man 's going to catch that fish . " " Why do you say that ? " " We 're not meant to catch it , that 's why . We 're being readied . " " For what ? " " We 'll know when the time comes . " " I see . " Ellen put the stamps in her purse . " Well , maybe you 're right . Thanks , Minnie . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll be no mistaking it , " Minnie said to Ellen 's back . Ellen walked to Main Street and turned right , past a boutique and an antique shop . She stopped at Amity Hardwareand went inside . There was no immediate response to the tinkle of the bell that the door struck as she opened it . She waited for a few seconds , then called , " Albert ? " She walked to the back of the store , to an open door that led to the basement . She heard two men talking below . " I 'll be right up , " called the voice of Albert Morris . " Here 's a whole box of them , " Morris said to the other man . " Look through and see if you find what you want . " Morris came to the bottom of the stairs and started up  --  slowly and deliberately , one step at a time , holding on to thep118banister . He was in his early sixties , and he had had a heart attack two years earlier . " Cleats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stairs . " What ? " said Ellen . " Cleats . Fella wants cleats for a boat . Size he 's looking for , he must be the captain of a battleship . Anyway , what can I do for you ? " " The rubber nozzle in my kitchen sink is all cracked . You know , the kind with the switch for spraying . I want to get a new one . " " No problem . They 're up this way . " Morris led Ellen to a cabinet in the middle of the store . " This what you had in mind ? " He held up a rubber nozzle . " Perfect . " " Eighty cents . Charge or cash ? " " I 'll pay you for it . I do n't want you to have to write up a slip just for eighty cents . " " Written ' em a lot smaller ' n that , " said Morris . " I could tell you stories that 'd set your ears to ringing . " They walked across the narrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the sale on the register , Morris said , " Lots of people upset about this shark thing . " " I know . You ca n't blame them . " " They think the beaches ought a be opened up again . " " Well , I ... " " You ask me , I think they 're full of  --  pardon the expression  --  bull . I think Martin 's doing right . " " I 'm glad to know that , Albert . " " Maybe this new fella can help us out . " " Who 's that ? " " This fish expert from up Massachusetts . " " Oh yes . I heard he was in town . " " He 's right here . "  |p119Ellen  looked around and saw no one . " What do you mean ? " " Down cellar . He 's the one wants the cleats . " Just then , Ellen heard footsteps on the stairs . She turned and saw Hooper coming through the door , and she suddenlyfelt a surge of girlish nervousness , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in years . The man was a stranger , yet there was something familiar about him . " I found them , " said Hooper , holding up two large stainless-steelcleats . He walked over to the counter , smiled politely at Ellen , and said to Morris , " These 'll do fine . " He put the cleats on the counter and handed Morris a twentydollarbill . Ellen looked at Hooper , trying to define her reminiscence . She hoped Albert Morris would introduce them , but he seemed to have no intention of doing so . " Excuse me , " she said to Hooper , " but I have to ask you something . " Hooper looked at her and smiled again  --  a pleasant , friendly smile that softened the sharpness of his features and made his light blue eyes shine . " Sure , " he said . " Ask away . " " You are n't by any chance related to David Hooper , are you ? " " He 's my older brother . Do you know David ? " " Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to . I went out with him a long time ago . I 'm Ellen Brody . I used to be Ellen Shepherd . Back then , I mean . " " Oh sure . I remember you . " " You do n't . " " I do . No kidding . I 'll prove it to you . Let me see . . . . You wore your hair shorter then , sort of a pageboy . You always wore a charm bracelet . I remember that because it had a big charm that looked like the Eiffel Tower . And you al/ways used to sing that song  --  what was it called ?  --  ' Shiboom , ' or something like that . Right ? " Ellen laughed . " My heavens , you have quite a memory . I 'd forgotten that song . " " It 's screwy the things that impress kids . You went out with David for what  --  two years ? " " Two summers , " Ellen said . " They were fun . I had n't thought about them much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember me ? " " Vaguely . I 'm not sure . I remember David had a younger brother . You must have been about nine or ten then . " " About that ; David 's ten years older than I am . Another thing I remember : Everybody called me Matt . I thought it sounded grown-up . But you called me Matthew . You said it sounded more dignified . I was probably in love with you . " " Oh ? " Ellen reddened , and Albert Morris laughed . " At one time or another , " said Hooper , " I fell in love with all the girls David went out with . " " Oh . " Morris handed Hooper his change , and Hooper said to Ellen , " I 'm going down to the dock . Can I drop you any-where ? " " Thank you . I have a car . " She thanked Morris , and , with Hooper behind her , walked out of the store . " So now you 're a scientist , " she said when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I started out as an English major . But then I took a course in marine biology to satisfy my sciencerequirement , and  --  bingo !  --  I was hooked . " " On what ? The ocean ? " " No . I mean , yes and no . I was always crazy about the ocean . When I was twelve or thirteen , my idea of a big time was to take a sleeping bag down to the beach and spend the night lying in the sand listening to the waves , wonderingp121where they had come from and what fantastic things they had passed on the way . What I got hooked on in college was fish , or , to be really specific , sharks . " Ellen laughed . " What an awful thing to fall in love with . It 's like having a passion for rats . " " That 's what most people think , " said Hooper . " But they 're wrong . Sharks have everything a scientist dreams of . They 're beautiful  --  God , how beautiful they are ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They 're as graceful as any bird . They 're as mysterious as any animal on earth . No one knows for sure how long they live or what impulses  --  except for hunger  --  they respond to . There are more than two hundred and fifty species of shark , and every one is different from every other one . Scientists spend their lives trying to find answers about sharks , and as soon as they come up with a nice , pat generalization , something shoots it down . People have been trying to find an effective shark repellent for over two thousand years . They 've never found one that really works . " He stopped , looked at Ellen , and smiled . " I 'm sorry . I do n't mean to lecture . As you can see , I 'm an addict . " " And as you can see , " said Ellen , " I do n't know what I 'm talking about . I imagine you went to Yale . " " Of course . Where else ? For four generations , the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was an uncle of mine who got thrown out of Andover and ended up at Miami of Ohio . After Yale , I went to graduate school at the Universityof Florida . And after that , I spent a couple of years chasing sharks around the world . " " That must have been interesting . " " For me it was paradise . It was like giving an alcoholic the keys to a distillery . I tagged sharks in the Red Sea and dove with them off Australia . The more I learned about them , the more I knew I did n't know . "  | " You dove with them ? " Hooper nodded . " In a cage mostly , but sometimes not . I know what you must think . A lot of people think I 've got a death wish  --  my mother in particular . But if you know what you 're doing , you can reduce the danger to almost nil . " " You must be the world 's greatest living shark expert . " " Hardly , " Hooper said with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one trip I missed out on , the one I would have given anything to go on , was Peter Gimbel 's trip . It was made into a movie . I dream about that trip . They were in the water with two great whites , the same kind of shark that 's here now . " " I 'm just as glad you did n't go on that trip , " said Ellen . " You probably would have tried to see what the view was like from inside one of the sharks . But tell me about David . How is he ? " " He 's okay , all things considered . He 's a broker in San Francisco . " " What do you mean , all things considered ' ? " " Well , he 's on his second wife . His first wife was  --  maybe you know this  --  Patty Fremont . " " Sure . I used to play tennis with her . She sort of inherited David from me . That 's a nice way of putting it . " " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a family business and a house in Antibes . So David went and found himself a girl whose father is the majority stockholder in an oil company . She 's nice enough , but she 's got the IQ of an artichoke . If David had any sense , he would have known when he had it good and he would have held on to you . " Ellen blushed and said softly , " You 're nice to say it . " " I 'm serious . That 's what I 'd have done if I 'd been him . " " What did you do ? What lucky girl finally got you ? " " None , so far . I guess there are girls around who just don'tp123know how lucky they could be . " Hooper laughed . " Tell me about yourself . No , do n't . Let me guess . Three children . Right ? " " Right . I did n't realize it showed that much . " " No no . I do n't mean that . It does n't show at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's see  --  a lawyer . You have an apartment in town and a house on the beach in Amity . You could n't be happier . And that 's exactly what I 'd wish for you . " Ellen shook her head , smiling . " Not quite . I do n't mean the happiness part , the rest . My husband is the police chief in Amity . " Hooper let the surprise show in his eyes for only an instant . Then he smacked himself on the forehead and said , " What a dummy I am ! Of course . Brody . I never made the connection . That 's great . I met your husband last night . He seems like quite a guy . " Ellen thought she detected a flicker of irony in Hooper 's voice , but then she told herself , Do n't be stupid  --  you 're makingthings up . " How long will you be here ? " she said . " I do n't know . That depends on what happens with this fish . As soon as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live in Woods Hole ? " " No , but not far away . In Hyannisport . I have a little house on the water . I have a thing about being near the water . If I get more than ten miles inland , I begin to feel claustrophobic . " " You live all alone ? " " All alone . It 's just me and about a hundred million dollars ' worth of stereo equipment and a million books . Hey , do you still dance ? " " Dance ? " " Yeah . I just remembered . One of the things David usedp124to say was that you were the best dancer he ever went out with . You won a contest , did n't you ? " The past  --  like a bird long locked in a cage and suddenly released  --  was flying at her , swirling around her head , showeringher with longing . " A samba contest , " she said . " At the Beach Club . I 'd forgotten . No , I do n't dance any more . Martindoes n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't think anyone plays that kind of music any more . " " That 's too bad . David said you were terrific . " " That was a wonderful night , " Ellen said , letting her mind float back , picking out the tiny memories . " It was a Lester Lanin band . The Beach Club was covered with crepe paper and balloons . David wore his favorite jacket  --  red silk . " " I have it now , " said Hooper . " I inherited that from him . " " They played all those wonderful songs . Mountain Greenery ' was one . He could two-step so well . I could barely keep up with him . The only thing he would n't do was waltz . He said waltzes made him dizzy . Everybody was so tan . I do n't think there was any rain all summer long . I remember I chose a yellow dress for that night because it went with my tan . There were two contests , a charleston that Susie Kendalland Chip Fogarty won . And the samba @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we danced as if our lives depended on it . Bending sideways and backward like crazy people . I thought I was going to collapse when it was over . You know what we won for first prize ? A canned chicken . I kept it in my room until it got so old it began to swell not to think about them too much . " " Why ? " " The past always seems better when you look back on it than it did at the time . And the present never looks as good as it will in the future . It 's depressing if you spend too muchp125time reliving old joys . You think you 'll never have anything as good again . " " It 's easy for me to keep my mind off the past . " " Really ? Why ? " " It just was n't too great , that 's all . David was the firstborn . I was pretty much of an afterthought . I think my purpose in life was to keep the parents ' marriage together . And I failed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first thing you 're supposed to accomplish . David was twenty when the parents got divorced . I was n't even eleven . And the divorce was n't exactly amiable . The few years before it were n't too amiable , either . It 's the old story  --  nothing special  --  but it was n't a lot of fun . I probably make too much of it . Anyway , I look forward to a lot of things . I do n't look back a lot . " " I suppose that 's healthier . " " I do n't know . Maybe if I had a terrific past , I 'd spend all my time living in it . But . . . enough of that . I should get down to the dock . You 're sure I ca n't drop you anywhere . " " Positive , thank you . My car 's just across the street . " " Okay . Well . . . " Hooper held out his hand . " It 's been really great to see you again , and I hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like that , " said Ellen , shaking his hand . " I do n't suppose I could get you out on a tennis court late some afternoon . " Ellen laughed . " Oh my . I have n't held a tennis racket in my hand since I ca n't remember when . But thanks for asking . " Okay . Well , see you . " Hooper turned and trotted the few yards down the block to his car , a green Ford Pinto . Ellen stood and watched as Hooper started the car , maneuveredout of the parking space , and pulled out into the street . As he drove past her , she raised her hand to herp126shoulder and waved , tentatively , shyly . Hooper stuck his left hand out of the car window and waved . Then he turned the corner and was gone . A terrible , painful sadness clutched at Ellen . More than ever before , she felt that her life  --  the best part of it , at least , the part that was fresh and fun  --  was &..hind; her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read it as proof that she was an unsatisfactory mother , an unsatisfied wife . She hated her life , and hated herself for hating it . She thought of a line from a song Billy played on the stereo : " I 'd trade all my tomorrows for a single yesterday . " Would she make a deal like that ? She wondered . But what good was there in wondering ? Yesterdays were gone , spinning ever farther away down a shaft that had no bottom . None of the richness , none of the delight , could ever be retrieved . A vision of Hooper 's smiling face flashed across her mind . Forget it , she told herself . That 's stupid . Worse . It 's selfdefeating . She walked across the street and climbed into her car . As she pulled out into the traffic , she saw Larry Vaughan standing on the corner . God , she thought , he looks as sad as I feel.  |p127The  weekend was as quiet as the weekends in the late fall . With the beaches closed , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amity was practically deserted . Hooper cruised up and down the shore in Ben Gardner 's boat , but the only signs of life he saw in the water were a few schools of baitfish and one small school of bluefish . By Sunday night , after spending the day off East Hampton  --  the beaches there were crowded , and he thought there might be a chance the shark would appear where people were swimming  --  hetold Brody he was ready to conclude that the fish had gone back to the deep . " What makes you think so ? " Brody had asked . " There 's not a sign of him , " said Hooper . " And there are other fish around . If there was a big white in the neighborhood , everything else would vanish . That 's one of the things divers say about whites . When they 're around , there 's an awfulstillness in the water . " " I 'm not convinced , " said Brody . " At least not enough to open the beaches . Not yet . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  from Vaughan , from other real-estate agents , from merchants  --  to open the beaches . He almost wished Hooper had seen the fish . Thatp128would have been a certainty . Now there was nothing but negative evidence , and to his policeman 's mind that was not enough . On Monday afternoon , Brody - vas sitting in his office when Bixby announced a phone call from Ellen . " I 'm sorry to bother you , " she said , " but I wanted to check something with you . What would you think about giving a dinner party ? " " What for ? " " Just to have a dinner party . We have n't had one in years . I ca n't even remember when our last one was . " " No , " said Brody . " Neither can I. " But it was a lie . He remembered all too well their last dinner party : three years ago , when Ellen was in the midst of her crusade to re-establishher ties with the summer community . She had asked three summer couples . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conversations had been stiff , forced , and uncomfortable . Brody and his guests had searched each other for any common interest or experience , and they had failed . So after a while , the guests had fallen back on talking among themselves , self-consciously polite about including Ellen whenever she said something like , " Oh , I remember him ! " She had been nervous and flighty , and after the guests had left , after she had done the dishes and said twice to Brody , " Was n't that a nice evening ! " she had shut herself in the bathroom and wept . " Well , what do you think ? " said Ellen . " I do n't know . I guess it 's all right , if you want to do it . Who are you going to invite ? " " First of all , I think we should have Matt Hooper . " " What for ? He eats over at the Abelard , does n't he ? It 's all included in the price of the room . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You know that . He 's alone in town , and besides , he 's very nice . " " How do you know ? I did n't think you knew him . " " Did n't I tell you ? I ran into him in Albert Morris 's on Friday . I 'm sure I mentioned it to you . " " No , but never mind . It does n't make any difference . " " It turns out he 's the brother of the Hooper I used to know . He remembered a lot more about me than I did about him . But he is a lot younger . " " Uh-huh . When are you planning this shindig for ? " " I was thinking about tomorrow night . And it 's not going to be a shindig . I simply thought we could have a nice , small party with a few couples . Maybe six or eight people alto-gether . " " Do you think you can get people to come on that short notice ? " " Oh yes . Nobody does anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but that 's about all . " " Oh , " said Brody . " You mean summer people . " " That 's what I had in mind . Matt would certainly feel at ease with them . What about the Baxters ? Would they be fun ? " " I do n't think I know them . " " Yes , you do , silly . Clem and Cici Baxter . She was Cici Davenport . They live out on Scotch . He 's taking some vacationnow . I know because I saw him on the street this morn-ing . " " Okay . Try them if you want . " " Who else ? " " Somebody I can talk to . How about the Meadows ? " " But he already knows Harry . " " He does n't know Dorothy . She 's chatty enough . " " All right , " said Ellen . " I guess a little local color won'tp130hurt . And Harry does know everything that goes on around here . " " I was n't thinking about local color , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I know . I did n't mean anything . " " If you want local color , all you have to do is look in the other side of your bed . " " I know . I said I was sorry . " " What about a girl ? " said Brody . " I think you should try to find some nice young thing for Hooper . " There was a pause before Ellen said , " If you think so . " " I do n't really care . I just thought he might enjoy himself more if he had someone his own age to talk to . " " He 's not that young , Martin . And we 're not that old . But all right . I 'll see if I can think of somebody who 'd be fun for him . " " I 'll see you later , " Brody said , and he hung up the phone . He was depressed , for he saw something ominous in this dinnerparty . He could n't be sure , but he believed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stronger the belief became  --  that Ellen was launching another campaign to re-enter the world he had taken her from , and this time she had a lever with which to jimmy her way in : Hooper . The next evening , Brody arrived home a little after five . Ellen was setting the dinner table in the dining room . Brody kissed her on the cheek and said , " Boy , it 's been a long time since I 've seen that silver . " It was Ellen 's wedding silver , a gift from her parents . " I know . It took me hours to polish it . " " And will you look at this ? " Brody picked up a tulip wine glass . " Where did you get these ? " " I bought them at the Lure . " " How much ? " Brody set the glass down on the table.  | " Not much , " she said , folding a napkin and placing it neatly beneath a dinner fork and salad fork . " How much ? " " Twenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " You do n't kid around when you throw a party . " " We did n't have any decent wine glasses , " she said defensively . " The last of our old ones broke months ago , when Sean tipped over the sideboard . " Brody counted the places set around the table . " Only six ? " he said . " What happened ? " " The Baxters could n't make it . Cici called . Clem had to go into town on some business , and she thought she 'd go with him . They 're spending the night . " There was a fragile lilt to her voice , a false insouciance . " Oh , " said Brody . " Too bad . " He dared not show that he was pleased . " Who 'd you get for Hooper , some nice young chick ? " " Daisy Wicker . She works for Gibby at the Bibelot . She 's a nice girl . " " What time are people coming ? " " The Meadows and Daisy at seven-thirty . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Matt . " " Oh , that 's just an old joke he reminded me of . Apparently , I used to call him Matthew when he was young . The reason I wanted him to come early was so the kids would have a chance to get to know him . I think they 'll be fascinated . " Brody looked at his watch . " If people are n't coming till seven-thirty , that means we wo n't be eating till eight-thirty or nine . I 'll probably starve to death before then . I think I 'll grab a sandwich . " He started for the kitchen . " Do n't stuff yourself , " said Ellen . " I 've got a delicious dinner coming . "  |p132Brody  sniffed the kitchen aromas , eyed the clutter of pots and packages , and said , " What are you cooking ? " " It 's called butterfly lamb , " she said . " I hope I do n't do something stupid and botch it . " " " Smells good , " said Brody . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throw it out and wash the pot ? " From the living room Ellen said , " What stuff ? " " This stuff in the pot . " " What  --  omigod ! " she said , and she hurried into the kitchen . " Do n't you dare throw it out . " She saw the smile on Brody 's face . " Oh , you rat . " She slapped him on the rear . " That 's gazpacho . Soup . " " Are you sure it 's still okay ? " he teased . " It looks all slimy . " " That 's what it 's supposed to look like , you clot . " Brody shook his head . " Old Hooper 's going to wish he ate at the Abelard . " " You 're a beast , " she said . " Wait till you taste it . You 'll change your tune . " " Maybe . If I live long enough . " He laughed and went to the refrigerator . He rummaged around and found some bologna and cheese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the living room . " I think I 'll watch the news for a while and then go shower and change , " he said . " I put clean clothes out for you on the bed . You might shave , too . You have a hideous five o'clock shadow . " " Good God , who 's coming to dinner  --  Prince Philip and Jackie Onassis ? " " I just want you to look nice , that 's all . " At 7:05 , the door bell rang , and Brody answered it . He was wearing a blue madras shirt , blue uniform slacks , and black cordovans . He felt crisp and clean . Spiffy , Ellen had said . But when he opened the door for Hooper , he felt , if not rumpled , at least outclassed . Hooper wore bell-bottomp133bluejeans , Weejun loafers with no socks , and a red Lacoste shirt with an alligator on the breast . It was the uniform of the young and rich in Amity . " Hi , " said Brody . " Come in . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hand , and Brody shook it . Ellen came out of the kitchen . She was wearing a long batik skirt , slippers , and a blue silk blouse . She wore the string of cultured pearls Brody had given her as a wedding present . " Matthew , " she said . " I 'm glad you could come . " " I 'm glad you asked me , " Hooper said , shaking Ellen 's hand . " I 'm sorry I do n't look more respectable , but I did n't bring anything down with me but working clothes . All I can say for them is that they 're clean . " " Do n't be silly , " said Ellen . " You look wonderful . The red goes beautifully with your tan and your hair . " Hooper laughed . He turned and said to Brody , " Do you mind if I give Ellen something ? " " What do you mean ? " Brody said . He thought to himself , Give her what ? A kiss ? A box of chocolates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's nothing , really . Just something I picked up . " No , I do n't mind , " said Brody , still perplexed that the question should have been asked . Hooper dug into the pocket of his jeans and pulled out a small package wrapped in tissue . He handed it to Ellen . " For the hostess , " he said , " to make up for my grubby clothes . " Ellen tittered and carefully unwrapped the paper . Inside was what seemed to be a charm , or perhaps a necklace pendant , an inch or so across . " It 's lovely , " she said . " What is it ? " " It 's a shark tooth , " said Hooper . " A tiger-shark tooth , to be more specific . The casing 's silver . "  | " Where did you get it ? " " In Macao . I passed through there a couple of years ago on a project . There was a little back-street store , where an even littler Chinese man spent his whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold the rings . I could n't resist them . " " Macao , " said Ellen . " I do n't think I could place Macao on a map if I had to . It must have been fascinating . " Brody said , " It 's near Hong Kong . " " Right , " said Hooper . " In any event , there 's supposed to be a superstition about these things , that if you keep it with you you 'll be safe from shark bite . Under the present circumstances , I thought it would be appropriate . " " Completely , " said Ellen . " Do you have one ? " " I have one , " said Hooper , " but I do n't know how to carry it . I do n't like to wear things around my neck , and if you carry a shark tooth in your pants pocket , I 've found you run two real risks . One is that you 'll get stabbed in the leg , and the other is that you 'll end up with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an open-blade knife around in your pocket . So in my case , practicality takes precedence over superstition , at least while I 'm on dry land . " Ellen laughed and said to Brody , " Martin , could I ask a huge favor ? Would you run upstairs and get that thin silver chain out of my jewelry box ? I 'll put Matthew 's shark tooth on right now . " She turned to Hooper and said , " You never know when you might meet a shark at dinner . " Brody started up the stairs , and Ellen said , " Oh , and Martin , tell the boys to come down . " As he rounded the corner at the top of the stairs , Brody heard Ellen say , " It is such fun to see you again . " Brody walked into the bedroom and sat down on the edge of the bed . He took a deep breath and clenched and un/clenched his right fist . He was fighting anger and confusion , and he was losing . He felt threatened , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possessing subtle , intangible weapons he could not cope with : looks and youth and sophistication and , above all , a communion with Ellen born in a time which , Brody knew , Ellen wished had never ended . Where previouslyhe had felt Ellen was trying to use Hooper to impress other summer people , now he felt she was trying to impress Hooper herself . He did n't know why . Maybe he was wrong . After all , Ellen and Hooper had known each other long ago . Perhaps he was making too much of two friends simply trying to get to know one another again . Friends ? Christ , Hooper had to be ten years younger than Ellen , or almost . What kind of friends could they have been ? Acquaintances . Barely . So why was she putting on her supersophisticated act ? It demeaned her , Brody thought ; and it demeaned Brody that she should try , by posturing , to deny her life with him . " Fuck it , " he said aloud . He stood up , opened a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ellen 's jewelry box . He took out the silver chain , closed the drawer , and walked into the hall . He poked his head into the boys ' rooms and said , " Let 's go , troops , " and then he walked downstairs . Ellen and Hooper were sitting at opposite ends of the couch , and as Brody walked into the living room , he heard Ellen say , " Would you rather that I not call you Matthew ? " Hooper laughed and said , " I do n't mind . It does sort of bring back memories , and despite what I said the other day , there 's nothing wrong with that . " The other day ? Brody thought . In the hardware store ? That must have been some conversation . " Here , " he said to Ellen , handing her the chain . " Thank you , " she said . She unclasped the pearls andp136tossed them onto the coffee table . " Now , Matthew , show me how this should go . " Brody picked the string @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pocket . The boys came downstairs single file , all dressed neatly in sport shirts and slacks . Ellen snapped the silver chain around her neck , smiled at Hooper , and said , " Come here , boys . Come meet Mr. Hooper . This is Billy Brody . Billy 's fourteen . " Billy shook hands with Hooper . " And this is MartinJunior . He 's twelve . And this is Sean . He 's nine . . . almostnine . Mr. Hooper is an oceanographer . " " An icthyologist , actually , " said Hooper . " What 's that ? " said Martin Junior . " A zoologist who specializes in fish life . " " What 's a zoologist ? " asked Sean . " I know that , " said Billy . " That 's a guy who studies ani-mals . " " Right , " said Hooper . " Good for you . " " Are you going to catch the shark ? " asked Martin . " I 'm going to try to find him , " said Hooper . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away already . " " Have you ever caught a shark ? " " Yes , but not one as big as this . " Sean said , " Do sharks lay eggs ? " " That , young man , " said Hooper , " is a good question , and a very complicated one . Not like a chicken , if that 's what you mean . But yes , some sharks do have eggs . " Ellen said , " Give Mr. Hooper a chance , boys . " She turned to Brody . " Martin , could you make us a drink ? " " Sure , " said Brody . " What 'll it be ? " " A gin and tonic would be fine for me , " said Hooper . " What about you , Ellen ? " " Let 's see . What would be good . I think I 'll just have some vermouth on the rocks . "  | " Hey , Mom , " said Billy , " what 's that around your neck ? " " A shark tooth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Hey , that 's really cool . Can I look ? " Brody went into the kitchen . The liquor was kept in a cabinet over the sink . The door was stuck . He tugged at the metal handle , and it came off in his hand . Without thinking , he pegged it into the garbage pail . From a drawer he took a screwdriver and pried open the cabinet door . Vermouth . What the hell was the color of the bottle ? Nobody ever drank vermouth on the rocks . Ellen 's drink when she drank , and that was rarely , was rye and ginger . Green . There it was , way in the back . Brody grabbed the bottle , twisted off the cap , and sniffed . It smelled like one of those cheap , fruity wines the winos bought for sixty-nine a pint . Brody made the two drinks , then fashioned a rye and gingerfor himself . By habit , he began to measure the rye with a shot glass , but then he changed his mind and poured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off with ginger ale , dropped in a few ice cubes , and reached for the two other glasses . The only convenient way to carry them in one hand was to grip one with the thumb and last three fingers of his hand and then support the other against the first by sticking his index finger down the inside of the glass . He took a slug of his own drink and went back into the living room . Billy and Martin had crowded onto the couch with Ellen and Hooper . Sean was sitting on the floor . Brody heard Hooper say something about a pig , and Martin said , " Wow ! " " Here , " said Brody , handing the forward glass  --  the one with his finger in it  --  to Ellen . " No tip for you , my man , " she said . " It 's a good thing you decided against a career as a waiter . " Brody looked at her , considered a series of rude remarks , and settled for , " Forgive me , Duchess . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I guess this is what you had in mind . " " That 's great . Thanks . " " Matt was just telling us about a shark he caught , " said Ellen . " It had almost a whole pig in it . " " No kidding , " said Brody , sitting in a chair opposite the couch . " And that 's not all , Dad , " said Martin . " There was a roll of tar paper , too . " " And a human bone , " said Sean . " I said it looked like a human bone , " said Hooper . " There was no way to be sure at the time . It might have been a beef rib . " Brody said , " I thought you scientists could tell those things right on the spot . " " Not always , " said Hooper . " Especially when it 's only a piece of a bone like a rib . " Brody took a long swallow of his drink and said , " Oh . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know how a porpoise kills a shark ? " " With a gun ? " " No , man . It butts him to death . That 's what Mr. Hooper says . " " Terrific , " said Brody , and he drained his glass . " I 'm going to have another drink . Anybody else ready ? " " On a week night ? " said Ellen . " My . " " Why not ? It 's not every night we throw a no-kidding , goto-helldinner party . " Brody started for the kitchen but was stopped by the ringing of the doorbell . He opened the door and saw Dorothy Meadows , short and slight , dressed , as usual , in a dark blue dress and a single strand of pearls . Behindher was a girl Brody assumed was Daisy Wicker  --  a tall , slim girl with long , straight hair . She wore slacks andp139sandals and no makeup . Behind her was the unmistakable bulk of Harry Meadows . " Hello , there , " said Brody . " Come on in . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Meadows . " We met Miss Wicker as we came into the driveway . " " I walked , " said Daisy Wicker . " It was nice . " " Good , good . Come on in . I 'm Martin Brody . " " I know . I 've seen you driving your car . You must have an interesting job . " Brody laughed . " I 'd tell you all about it , except it would probably put you to sleep . " Brody led them into the living room and turned them over to Ellen for introduction to Hooper . He took drink orders  --  Bourbon on the rocks for Harry , club soda with a twist of lemon for Dorothy , and a gin and tonic for Daisy Wicker . But before he fixed their drinks , he made a fresh one for himself , and he sipped it as he prepared the others . By the time he was ready to return to the living room , he had finished about half his drink , so he poured in a generous splash of rye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's and Daisy 's drinks first , and returned to the kitchen for Meadows ' and his own . He was taking one last swallow before rejoining the company , when Ellen came into the kitchen . " Do n't you think you better slow down ? " she said . " I 'm fine , " he said . " Do n't worry about me . " " You 're not being exactly gracious . " " I 'm not ? I thought I was being charming . " " Hardly . " He smiled at her and said , " Tough shit , " and as he spoke , he realized she was right : he had better slow down . He walked into the living room . The children had gone upstairs . Dorothy Meadows sat onp140the couch next to Hooper and was chatting with him about his work at Woods Hole . Meadows , in the chair opposite the couch , listened quietly . Daisy Wicker was standing alone , on the other side of the room , by the fireplace , gazing about with a subdued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and strolled over next to Daisy . " You 're smiling , " he said . " Am I ? I did n't notice . " " Thinking of something funny ? " " No . I guess I was just interested . I 've never been in a policeman 's house before . " " What did you expect ? Bars on the windows ? A guard at the door ? " " No , nothing . I was just curious . " " And what have you decided ? It looks just like a normal person 's house , does n't it ? " " I guess so . Sort of . " " What does that mean ? " " Nothing . " " Oh . " She took a sip of her drink and said , " Do you like being a policeman ? " Brody could n't tell whether or not there was hostility in the question . " Yes , " he said . " It 's a good job , and it has a purposeto it . " " What 's the purpose ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , slightly irritated . " To upholdthe law . " " Do n't you feel alienated ? " " Why the hell should I feel alienated ? Alienated from what ? " " From the people . I mean , the only thing that justifies your existence is telling people what not to do . Does n't that make you feel freaky ? "  |p141For  a moment , Brody thought he was being put on , but the girl never smiled or smirked or shifted her eyes from his . " No , I do n't feel freaky , " he said . " I do n't see why I should feel any more freaky than you do , working at the whatchama-callit . " " The Bibelot . " " Yeah . What do you sell there anyway ? " " We sell people their past . It gives them comfort . " " What do you mean , their past ? " " Antiques . They 're bought by people who hate their presentand need the security of their past . Or if not theirs , someoneelse 's . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bet that 's important to you , too . " " What , the past ? " " No , security . Is n't that supposed to be one of the heavy things about being a cop ? " Brody glanced across the room and noticed that Meadows ' glass was empty . " Excuse me , " he said . " I have to tend to the other guests . " " Sure . Nice talking to you . " Brody took Meadows ' glass and his own into the kitchen . Ellen was filling a bowl with Tortilla chips . " Where the hell did you find that girl ? " he said . " Under a rock ? " " Who ? Daisy ? I told you , she works at the Bibelot . " " Have you ever talked to her ? " " A little . She seems very nice and bright . " " She 's a spook . She 's just like some of the kids we bust who start smart-mouthing us in the station . " He made a drink for Meadows , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ellen staring at him . " What 's the matter with you ? " she said . " I guess I do n't like strange people coming into my house and insulting me. "  | " Honestly , Martin . I 'm sure there was no insult intended . She was probably just being frank . Frankness is in these days , you know . " ' Well , if she gets any franker with me , she 's gon na be out , I 'll tell you that . " He picked up the two drinks and started for the door . Ellen said , " Martin . . . " and he stopped . " For my sake ... please . " " Do n't worry about a thing . Everything 'll be fine . Like they say in the commercials , calm down . " He refilled Hooper 's drink and Daisy Wicker 's without refilling his own . Then he sat down and nursed his drink through a long story Meadows was telling Daisy . Brody felt all right  --  pretty good , in fact  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to drink before dinner , he 'd be fine . At 8:3o , Ellen brought the soup plates out from the kitchen and set them around the table . " Martin , " she said , " would you open the wine for me while I get everyone seated ? " " Wine ? " " There are three bottles in the kitchen . A white in the iceboxand two reds on the counter . You may as well open them all . The reds will need time to breathe . " " Of course they will , " Brody said as he stood up . " Who does n't ? " " Oh , and the tire-bouchin is on the counter next to the red . " " The what ? " Daisy Wicker said , " It 's tire-bouchon . The corkscrew . " Brody took vengeful pleasure in seeing Ellen blush , for it relieved him of some of his own embarrassment . He found the corkscrew and went to work on the two bottles of red wine . He pulled one cork cleanly , but the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bottle . He took the bottle of white out of the refrigerator , and as he uncorkedit he tangled his tongue trying to pronounce the name of the wine : Montrachet . He arrived at what seemed to him an acceptable pronunciation , wiped the bottle dry with a dishtowel , and took it into the dining room . Ellen was seated at the end of the table nearest the kitchen . Hooper was at her left , Meadows at her right . Next to Meadows , Daisy Wicker , then an empty space for Brody at the far end of the table , and , opposite Daisy , Dorothy Meadows . Brody put his left hand behind his back and , standing over Ellen 's right shoulder , poured her a glass of wine . " A glass of Mount Ratchet , " he said . " Very good year , 1970 . I remember it well . " " Enough , " said Ellen , tipping the mouth of the bottle up . " Do n't fill the glass all the way . " " Sorry , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When he had finished pouring the wine , Brody sat down . He looked at the soup in front of him . Then he glanced furtivelyaround the table and saw that the others were actually eating it : it was n't a joke . So he took a spoonful . It was cold , and it did n't taste anything like soup , but it was n't bad . " I love gazpacho , " said Daisy , " but it 's such a pain to make that I do n't have it very often . " " Mmmm , " said Brody , spooning another mouthful of soup . " Do you have it very often ? " " No , " he said . " Not too often . " " Have you ever tried a G and G ? " " Ca n't say as I have . " " You ought to try one . Of course , you might not enjoy it since it 's breaking the law . "  | " You mean eating this thing is breaking the law ? How ? What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of herbs , you sprinkle a littlegrass over the top . Then you smoke a little , eat a little , smoke a little , eat a little . It 's really wild . " It was a moment before Brody realized what she was saying , and even when he understood , he did n't answer right away . He tipped his soup bowl toward himself , scooped out the last little bit of soup , drained his wine glass in one draft , and wiped his mouth with his napkin . He looked at Daisy , who was smiling sweetly at him , and at Ellen , who was smilingat something Hooper was saying . " It really is , " said Daisy . Brody decided to be low-keyed  --  avuncular and nonethelessannoyed , but low-keyed , so as not to upset Ellen . " You know , " he said , " I do n't find ... " " I bet Matt 's tried one . " " Maybe he has . I do n't see what that ... " Daisy raised her voice and said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other end of the table stopped . " I was just curious . Have you ever tried a G and G ? By the way , Mrs. Brody , this is terrific gazpacho . " " Thank you , " said Ellen . " But what 's a G and G ? " " I tried one once , " said Hooper . " But I was never really into that . " " You must tell me , " Ellen said . " What is it ? " " Matt 'll tell you , " said Daisy , and just as Brody turned to say something to her , she leaned over to Meadows and said , " Tell me more about the water table . " Brody stood up and began to clear away the soup bowls . As he walked into the kitchen , he felt a slight rush of nausea and dizziness , and his forehead was sweating . But by the time he put the bowls into the sink , the feeling had passed.  |p145Ellen  followed him into the kitchen and tied an apron around her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said . " Okeydoke , " said Brody , and he searched through a drawer for a carving knife and fork . " What did you think of that ? " " Of what ? " " That G and G business . Did Hooper tell you what it is ? " " Yes . That was pretty funny , was n't it ? I must say , it sounds tasty . " " How would you know ? " " You never know what we ladies do when we get together over at the hospital . Here , carve . " With a two-tine serving fork , she hefted the lamb onto the carving board . " Slices about three quarters of an inch thick , if you can , the way you 'd slice a steak . " That Wicker bitch was right about one thing , Brody thought as he slashed the meat : I sure as shit feel alienated right now . A slab of meat fell away , and Brody said , " Hey , I thought you said this was lamb . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done . Look at that . " He held up the piece he had sliced . It was pink and , toward the middle , almost red . " That 's the way it 's supposed to be . " " Not if it 's lamb , it is n't . Lamb 's supposed to be cooked through , well done . " " Martin , believe me . It 's all right to cook a butterfly lamb sort of medium . I promise you . " Brody raised his voice . " I 'm not gon na eat raw lamb ! " " Ssshhh ! For God 's sake . Ca n't you keep your voice down ? " Brody said in a hoarse whisper , " Then put the goddam thing back till it 's done . "  | " It 's done ! " said Ellen . " If you do n't want to eat it , do n't eat it , but that 's the way I 'm going to serve it . " " Then cut it yourself . " Brody dropped the knife and fork @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of red wine , and left the kitchen . " There 'll be a short delay , " he said as he approached the table , " while the cook kills our dinner . She tried to serve it as it was , but it bit her on the leg . " He raised a bottle of wine over one of the clean glasses and said , " I wonder why you 're not allowed to serve red wine in the same glass the white wine was . " " The tastes , " said Meadows , " do n't complement each other . " " What you 're saying is , it 'll give you gas . " Brody filled the six glasses and sat down . He took a sip of wine , said , " Good , " then took another sip and another . He refilled his glass . Ellen came in from the kitchen carrying the carving board . She set it on the sideboard next to a stack of plates . She returned to the kitchen and came back , carrying two vegetable dishes . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I have n't tried it before . " " What is it ? " asked Dorothy Meadows . " It smells de-licious . " " Butterfly lamb . Marinated . " " Really ? What 's in the marinade ? " " Ginger , soy sauce , a whole bunch of things . " She put a thick slice of lamb , some asparagus and summer squash on each plate , and passed the plates to Meadows , who sent them down and around the table . When everyone had been served and Ellen had sat down , Hooper raised his glass and said , " A toast to the chef . " The others raised their glasses , and Brody said , " Good luck . "  |p147Meadows  took a bite of meat , chewed it , savored it , and said , " Fantastic . It 's like the tenderest of sirloins , only better . What a splendid flavor . " " Coming from you , Harry , " said Ellen , " that 's a special compliment . " " It 's delicious , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recipe ? Harry will never forgive me if I do n't give this to him at least once a week . " " He better rob a bank , " said Brody . " But it is delicious , Martin , do n't you think ? " Brody did n't answer . He had started to chew a piece of meat when another wave of nausea hit him . Once again sweat popped out on his forehead . He felt detached , as if his body were controlled by someone else . He sensed panic at the loss of motor control . His fork felt heavy , and for a moment he feared it might slip from his fingers and clatter onto the table . He gripped it with his fist and held on . He was sure his tongue would n't behave if he tried to speak . It was the wine . It had to be the wine . With greatly exaggeratedprecision , he reached forward to push his wine glass away from him . He slid his fingers along the tablecloth to minimize the chances of knocking over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breath . His vision blurred . He tried to focus his eyes on a painting above Ellen 's head , but he was distracted by the image of Ellen talking to Hooper . Every time she spoke she touched Hooper 's arm  --  lightly , but , Brody thought , intimately , as if they were sharing secrets . He did n't hear what anyone was saying . The last thing he remembered hearing was , " Do n't you think ? " How long ago was that ? Who had said it ? He did n't know . He looked at Meadows , who was talking to Daisy . Then he looked at Dorothy and said thickly , " Yes . "  | " What did you say , Martin ? " She looked up at him . " Did you say something ? " He could n't speak . He wanted to stand and walk out to the kitchen , but he did n't trust his legs . He 'd never make it without holding on to something . Just sit still , he told himself . It 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear . Ellen was touching Hooper again . Talk and touch , talk and touch . " Boy , it 's hot , " he said . He stood up and walked , carefully but steadily , to a window and tugged it open . He leaned on the sill and pressed his face against the screen . " Nice night , " he said . He straightened up . " I think I 'll get a glass of water . " He walked into the kitchen and shook his head . He turned on the coldwatertap and rubbed some water on his brow . He filled a glass and drank it down , then refilled it and drank that down . He took a few deep breaths , went back into the dining room , and sat down . He looked at the food on his plate . Then he suppressed a shiver and smiled at Dorothy . " Any more , anybody ? " said Ellen . " There 's plenty here . " " Indeed , " said Meadows . " But you 'd better serve the othersfirst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole thing . " " And you know what you 'd be saying tomorrow , " said Brody . " What 's that ? " Brody lowered his voice and said gravely , " I ca n't believe I ate the whole thing . " Meadows and Dorothy laughed , and Hooper said , in a high falsetto whine , " No , Ralph , I ate it . " Then even Ellen laughed . It was going to be all right . By the time dessert was served  --  coffee ice cream in a pool of creme de cacao  --  Brody was feeling well . He had two helpings of ice cream , and he chatted amiably with Dorothy.  |p149He  smiled when Daisy told him a story about lacing the stuffing of last Thanksgiving 's turkey with marijuana . " My only worry , " said Daisy , " was that my maiden aunt called Thanksgiving morning and asked if she could come for dinner . The turkey was already made and stuffed . " " So what happened ? " said Brody . " I tried to sneak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point of asking for it , so I said what the heck and gave her a big spoonful . " " And ? " " By the end of the meal she was giggling like a little girl . She even wanted to dance . To Hair yet . " " It 's a good thing I was n't there , " said Brody . " I would have arrested you for corrupting the morals of a maiden . " They had coffee in the living room , and Brody offered drinks , but only Meadows accepted . " A tiny brandy , if you have it , " he said . Brody looked at Ellen , as if to ask , Do we have any ? " In the cupboard , I think , " she said . Brody poured Meadows ' drink and thought briefly of pouring one for himself . But he resisted , telling himself , Do n't press your luck . At a little after ten , Meadows yawned and said , " Dorothy , I think we had best take our leave . I find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up too late . " " I should go , too , " said Daisy . " I have to be at work at eight . Not that we 're selling very much these days . " " You 're not alone , my dear , " said Meadows . " I know . But when you work on commission , you really feel it . " " Well , let 's hope the worst is over . From what I gather from our expert here , there 's a good chance the leviathan has left . " Meadows stood up.  | " A chance , " said Hooper . " I hope so . " He rose to go . " I should be on my way , too . " " Oh , do n't go ! " Ellen said to Hooper . The words came out much stronger than she had intended . Instead of a pleasant request , they sounded a shrill plea . She was embarrassed , and she added quickly , " I mean , the night is young . It 's only ten . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But if the weather 's any good tomorrow , I want to get up early and get out into the water . Besides , I have a car and I can drop Daisy off on my way home . " Daisy said , " That would be fun . " Her voice , as usual , was without tone or color , suggesting nothing . " The Meadows can drop her , " Ellen said . " True , " said Hooper , " but I really should go so I can get up early . But thanks for the thought . " They said their good-bys at the front door  --  perfunctory compliments , redundant thanks . Hooper was the last to leave , and when he extended his hand to Ellen , she took it in both of hers and said , " Thank you so much for my shark tooth . " " You 're welcome . I 'm glad you like it . " " And thank you for being so nice to the children . They were fascinated to meet you . " " So was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must have been about Sean 's age when I knew you before . You have n't changed much at all . " " Well , you 've certainly changed . " " I hope so . I 'd hate to be nine all my life . " " We 'll see you again before you go ? " " Count on it . " " Wonderful . " She released his hand . He said a quick good night to Brody and walked to his car.  |p151Ellen  waited at the door until the last of the cars had pulled out of the driveway , then she turned off the outside light . Without a word , she began to pick up the glasses , coffeecups , and ashtrays from the living room . Brody carried a stack of dessert dishes into the kitchen , set them on the sink , and said , " Well , that was all right . " He meant nothing by the remark , and sought nothing more than rote agreement . " No thanks to you , " said Ellen . " What ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He was genuinely surprised at the ferocity of her attack . " I know I got a little queasy there for a minute , but I did n't think  --  " " All evening , from start to finish , you were awful . " " That 's a lot of crap ! " " You 'll wake the children . " " I do n't give a damn . I 'm not going to let you stand thereand work out your own hang-ups by telling me I 'm a shit . " Ellen smiled bitterly . " You see ? There you go again . " " Where do I go again ? What are you talking about ? " " I do n't want to talk about it . " " Just like that . You do n't want to talk about it . Look .. . okay , I was wrong about the goddam meat . I should n't have blown my stack . I 'm sorry . Now ... " " I said I do n't want to talk about it ! " Brody was ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to realize that his only weapons were cruelty and innuendo , and that Ellen was close to tears . And tears , whether shed in orgasm or in anger , disconcerted him . So he said only , " Well , I 'm sorry about that . " He walked out of the kitchen and climbed the stairs . In the bedroom , as he was undressing , the thought oc/curred to him that the cause of all the unpleasantness , the source of the whole mess , was a fish : a mindless beast that he had never seen . The ludicrousness of the thought made him smile . He crawled into bed and , almost simultaneous with the touch of his head to the pillow , fell into a dreamless sleep . A boy and his date sat drinking beer at one end of the long mahogany bar in the Randy Bear . The boy was eighteen , the son of the pharmacist at the Amity Pharmacy . " You 'll have to tell him sometime , " said the girl . " I know . And when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " It was n't your fault . " " You know what he 'll say ? It must have been my fault . I must have done something , or else they would have kept me and canned somebody else . " " But they fired a lot of kids . " " They kept a lot , too . " " How did they decide who to keep ? " " They did n't say . They just said they were n't getting enough guests to justify a big staff , so they were letting some of us go . Boy , my old man is gon na go right through the roof . " " Ca n't he call them ? He must know somebody there . I mean , if he says you really need the money for college ... " " He would n't do it . That 'd be begging . " The boy finished his beer . " There 's only one thing I can do . Deal . " " " Oh , Michael , do n't do that . It 's too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's quite a choice , is n't it ? " the boy said acidly . " Collegeor jail . " " What would you tell your father ? " " I do n't know . Maybe I 'll tell him I 'm selling belts . "  |p153Brody  awoke with a start , jolted by a signal that told him something was wrong . He threw his arm across the bed to touch Ellen . She was n't there . He sat up and saw her sitting in the chair by the window . Rain splashed against the windowpanes , and he heard the wind whipping through the trees . " Lousy day , huh ? " he said . She did n't answer , continuing to stare fixedly at the drops sliding down the glass . " How come you 're up so early ? " " I could n't sleep . " Brody yawned . " I sure did n't have any trouble . " " I 'm not surprised . " " Oh boy . Are we starting in again ? " Ellen shook her head . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything . " She seemed subdued , sad . " What 's the matter ? " " Nothing . " " Whatever you say . " Brody got out of bed and went into the bathroom . When he had shaved and dressed , he went down to the kitchen . The boys were finishing their breakfast , and Ellenp154was frying an egg for him . " What are you guys gon na do on this crummy day ? " he said . " Clean lawnmowers , " said Billy , who worked during the summer for a local gardener . " Boy , do I hate rainy days . " " And what about you two ? " Brody said to Martin and Sean . " Martin 's going to the Boys Club , " said Ellen , " and Sean 's spending the day at the Santos 's . " " And you ? " " I 've got a full day at the hospital . Which reminds me : I wo n't be home for lunch . Can you get something down-town ? " " Sure . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I do n't , usually . But one of the other girls is sick , and I said I 'd fill in . " " Oh . " " I 'll be back by suppertime . " " Fine . " " Do you think you could drop Sean and Martin off on your way to work ? I want to do a little shopping on my way to the hospital . " " No problem . " " I 'll pick them up on my way home . " Brody and the two younger children left first . Then Billy , wrapped from head to foot in foul-weather gear , bicycled off to work . Ellen looked at the clock on the kitchen wall . It was a few minutes to eight . Too early ? Maybe . But better to catch him now , before he went off somewhere and the chance was lost . She held her right hand out in front of her and tried to steady the fingers , but they quivered uncontrollably . She smiled at her nervousness and whispered to herself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upstairs to the bedroom , satp155on the bed , and picked up the green phone book . She found the number for the Abelard Arms Inn , put her hand on the phone , hesitated for a moment , then picked up the receiver and dialed the number . " Abelard Arms . " " Mr. Hooper 's room , please . Matt Hooper . " " Just a minute , please . Hooper . Here it is . Four-oh-five . I 'll ring it for you . " Ellen heard the phone ring once , then again . She could hear her heart beating , and she saw the pulse throb in her right wrist . Hang up , she told herself . Hang up . There 's time . " Hello ? " said Hooper 's voice . " Oh . " She thought , Good God , suppose he 's got Daisy Wicker in the room with him . " Hello ? " Ellen swallowed and said , " Hi . It 's me . . . . I mean it 's Ellen . " " Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . " " No . I was just getting ready to go downstairs and have some breakfast . " " Good . It 's not a very nice day , is it ? " " No , but I do n't really mind . It 's a luxury for me to be able to sleep this late . " " Can you . . . will you be able to work today ? " " I do n't know . I was just trying to figure that out . I sure ca n't go out in the boat and hope to get anything done . " " Oh . " She paused , fighting the dizziness that was creeping up on her . Go ahead , she told herself . Ask the question . " I was wondering . . . " No , be careful ; ease into it . " I wanted to thank you for the beautiful charm . " " You 're welcome . I 'm glad you like it . But I should be thanking you . I had a good time last night . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too . I 'm glad you came . " " Yes . " " It was like old times . " " Yes . " Now , she said to herself . Do it . The words spilled from her mouth . " I was wondering , if you ca n't do any work today , I mean if you ca n't go out in the boat or anything , I was wondering if . . . if there was any chance you 'd like to . . . if you 're free for lunch . " " Lunch ? " " Yes . You know , if you have nothing else to do , I thought we might have some lunch . " " We ? You mean you and the chief and me ? " " No , just you and I. Martin usually has lunch at his desk . I do n't want to interfere with your plans or anything . I mean , if you 've got a lot of work to do ... " " No , no . That 's okay . Heck , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind ? " " There 's a wonderful place up in Sag Harbor . Banner 's . Do you know it ? " She hoped he did n't . She did n't know it , either , which meant that no one there would know her . But she had heard that it was good and quiet and dark . " No , I 've never been there , " said Hooper . " But Sag Harbor . That 's quite a hike for lunch . " " It 's not bad , really , only about fifteen or twenty minutes . I could meet you there whenever you like . " " Any time 's all right with me . " " Around twelve-thirty , then ? " " Twelve-thirty it is . See you then . " Ellen hung up the phone . Her hands were still shaking , but she felt elated , excited . Her senses seemed alive and incrediblykeen . Every time she drew a breath she savored the smells around her . Her ears jingled with a symphony of tinyp157house sounds  --  creaks and rustles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had in years  --  a warm , wet feeling both delicious and uncomfortable . She went into the bathroom and took a shower . She shaved her legs and under her arms . She wished she had bought one of those feminine hygiene deodorants she had seen advertised , but , lacking that , she powdered herself and daubed cologne behind her ears , inside her elbows , behind her knees , on her nipples , and on her genitals . There was a full-length mirror in the bedroom , and she stood before it , examining herself . Were the goods good enough ? Would the offering be accepted ? She had worked to keep in shape , to preserve the smoothness and sinuousness of youth . She could not bear the thought of rejection . The goods were good . The lines in her neck were few and barely noticeable . Her face was unblemished and unscarred . There were no droops or sags or pouches . She stood straight and admired the contours of her breasts . Her waist was slim , her belly flat  --  the reward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only problem , as she assessed her body critically , was her hips . By no stretch of anyone 's imaginationwere they girlish . They signaled motherhood . They were , as Brody once said , breeder 's hips . The recollection brought a quick flash of remorse , but excitement quickly nudged it aside . Her legs were long and  --  below the pad of fat on her rear  --  slender . Her ankles were delicate , and her feet  --  with the toenails neatly pruned  --  were perfect enough to suit any pediphile . She dressed in her hospital clothes . From the back of her closet she took a plastic shopping bag , into which she put a pair of bikini underpants , a bra , a neatly folder lavender summer dress , a pair of low-heeled pumps , a can of spray deodorant , a plastic bottle of bath powder , a toothbrushp158and a tube of toothpaste . She carried the bag to the garage , tossed it into the back seat of her Volkswagen beetle , backed out of the driveway , and drove to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been feeling for hours . She had not slept all night . She had first lain in bed , then sat by the window , struggling with all the twistingsof emotion and conscience , desire and regret , longing and recrimination . She did n't know exactly when she had decided on this manifestly rash , dangerous plan . She had been thinking about it  --  and trying not to think about it  --  since the day she first met Hooper . She had weighed the risks and , somehow , calculated that they were worth taking , though she was not entirely sure what she could gain from the adventure . She knew she wanted change , almost any change . She wanted to be assured and reassured that she was desirable  --  not just to her husband , for she had grown complacent about that , but to the people she saw as her real peers , the people among whom she still numbered herself . She felt that without some remedy , the part of herself that she most cherished would die . Perhaps the past could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physically as well as mentally . She wanted an injection , a transfusion of the essence of her past , and she saw Matt Hooper as the only possible donor . The thought of love never entered her mind . Nor did she want or anticipate a relationship either profoundor enduring . She sought only to be serviced , restored . She was grateful that the work assigned her when she arrived at the hospital demanded concentration and conversation , for it prevented her from thinking . She and another volunteer changed the bedding of the elderly patients for whom the hospital community was a surrogate  --  and , in some cases , final  --  home . She had to remember the names ofp159children in distant cities , had to fashion new excuses for why they had n't written . She had to feign recollection of the plots of television shows and speculate on why such-andsucha character had left his wife for a woman who was patently an adventuress . At 11:45 , Ellen told the supervisor of volunteers that she did n't feel well . Her thyroid was acting up again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She thought she 'd go lie down for a while in the staff lounge . And if a nap did n't help , she said , she 'd probably go home . In fact , if she was n't back on the job by 1:30 or so , the supervisor could assume she had gone home . It was an explanation that she hoped was vague enough to discourage anyone from actively looking for her . She went into the lounge , counted to twenty , and opened the door a crack to see if the corridor was empty . It was ; most of the staff were in , or on their way to , the cafeteria on the other side of the building . She stepped into the corridor , closed the door softly behind her , and hurried around a corner and out a side door of the hospital that led to the staff parking lot . She drove most of the way to Sag Harbor , then stopped at a gas station . When the tank was full and the gas paid for , she asked to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the key , and she pulled her car around to the side of the station , next to the ladies ' room door . She opened the door , but beforegoing into the ladies ' room she returned the key to the attendant . She walked to her car , removed the plastic bag from the back seat , entered the ladies ' room , and pushed the button that locked the door . She stripped , and standing on the cold floor in her bare feet , looking at her reflection in the mirror above the sink , she felt a thrill of risk . She sprayed deodorant under herp160arms and on her feet . She took the clean underpants from the plastic bag and stepped into them . She shook a little powder into each cup of the bra and put it on . She took the dress from the bag , unfolded it , checked it for wrinkles , and slipped it over her head . She poured powder into each of her shoes , brushed off the bottom of each foot with a paper towel , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and combed her hair , stuffed her hospital clothes into the plastic bag , and opened the door . She looked both ways , saw that no one was watching her , then stepped out of the ladies ' room , tossed the bag into the car , and got in . As she drove out of the gas station , she hunched down in her seat so the attendant , if he should chance to notice her , would not see that she had changed clothes . It was 1z:2o when she arrived at Banner 's , a small **26;646;TOOLONG on the water in Sag Harbor . The parking lot was in the rear , for which she was grateful . On the off-chance that someone she knew might drive down the street in Sag Harbor , she did n't want her car in plain view . One reason she had picked Banner 's was that it was known as a favorite nighttime restaurant for yachtsmen and summer people , which meant that it probably had little luncheon trade . And it was expensive , which made it almost certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go there for lunch . Ellen checked her wallet . She had nearly fifty dollars  --  all the emergency cash she and Brody kept in the house . She made a mental note of the bills : a twenty , two tens , a five , and three ones . She wanted to replaceexactly what she had taken from the coffee can in the kitchen closet . There were two other cars in the parking lot , a Chevrolet Vega and a bigger car , tan . She remembered that Hooper 's car was green and that it was named after some animal . Shep161left her car and walked into the restaurant , holding her hands over her head to protect her hair from the light rain . The restaurant was dark , but because the day was gloomy it took her eyes only a few seconds to adjust . There was only one room , with a bar on the right as she walked in and about twenty tables in the center . The left-hand wall was lined with eight booths . The walls were dark wood , decoratedwith bullfight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenties , Ellen guessed  --  was havinga drink at a table by the window . The bartender , a young man with a Vandyke beard and a button-down shirt , sat by the cash register reading the New York Daily News . They were the only people in the room . Ellen looked at her watch . Almost 12:30 . The bartender looked up and said , " Hi . Can I help you ? " Ellen stepped to the bar . " Yes . . . yes . In a minute . But first I 'd like . . . can you tell me where the ladies ' room is ? " " End of the bar , turn right . First door on your left . " " Thank you . " Ellen walked quickly down the length of the bar , turned right , and went into the ladies ' room . She stood in front of the mirror and held out her right hand . It trembled , and she clenched it into a fist . Calm down , she said to herself . You have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost . She felt that she was sweating , but when she put a hand inside her dress and felt her armpit , it was dry . She combed her hair and surveyed her teeth . She remembered something a boy she had once gone out with had said : Nothing turns my stomach faster than seeing a girl with a big piece of crud between her teeth . She looked at her watch : 12:35 . She went back into the restaurant and looked around . Just the same couple , the bartender , and a waitress standing at the bar , folding napkins.  |p162The  waitress saw Ellen come around the corner of the bar , and she said , " Hello . May I help you ? " " Yes . I 'd like a table , please . For lunch . " " For one ? " " No . Two . " " Fine , " said the waitress . She put down a napkin , picked up a pad , and walked Ellen to a table in the middle of the room . " Is this all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's fine . But I 'd like to have that table in the corner booth , if you do n't mind . " " Sure , " said the waitress . " Any table you like . We 're not exactly full . " She led Ellen to the table , and Ellen slipped into the booth with her back to the door . Hooper would be able to find her . If he came . " Can I get you a drink ? " " Yes . A gin and tonic , please . " When the waitress left the table , Ellen smiled . It was the first time since her wedding that she had had a drink during the day . The waitress brought the drink , and Ellen drank half of it immediately , eager to feel the relaxing warmth of alcohol . Every few seconds , she checked the door and looked at her watch . He 's not going to come , she thought . It was almost 12:45 . He got cold feet . He 's scared of Martin . Maybe he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he does n't come ? I guess I 'll have some lunch and go back to work . He 's got to come ! He ca n't do this to me . " Hello . " The word startled Ellen . She hopped in her seat and said , " Oh ! " Hooper slid into the seat opposite her and said , " I did n't mean to scare you . And I 'm sorry I 'm late . I had to stop for gas , and the station was jammed . The traffic was terrible . And so much for my excuses . I should have left more time . I am sorry . " He looked into her eyes and smiled  |p163She  looked down at her glass . " You do n't have to apologize . I was late myself . " The waitress came to the table . " Can I get you a drink ? " she said to Hooper . He noticed Ellen 's glass and said , " Oh , sure , I guess so . If you are . I 'll have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one , " said Ellen . " This one 's almost fin-ished . " The waitress left , and Hooper said , " I do n't normally drink at lunch . " " Neither do I. " " After about three drinks I say stupid things . I never did hold my liquor very well . " Ellen nodded . " I know the feeling . I tend to get sort of . .. " " Impetuous ? So do I. " " Really ? I ca n't imagine you getting impetuous . I thought scientists were n't ever impetuous . " Hooper smiled and said histrionically , " It may seem , madam , that we are wed to our test tubes . But beneath the icy exteriors there beat the hearts of some of the most brazen , raunchy people in the world . " Ellen laughed . The waitress brought the drinks and left two menus on the edge of the table . They talked  --  chatted , really  --  about old times , about people they had known and what those people were doing now , about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Brody or Ellen 's children . It was an easy , rambling conversation , which suited Ellen . Her second drink loosened her up , and she felt happy and in command of herself . She wanted Hooper to have another drink , and she knew he was not likely to take the initiative and order one . She picked up one of the menus , hoping that the waitress wouldp164notice the movement , and said , " Let me see . What looks good ? " Hooper picked up the other menu and began to read , and after a minute or two , the waitress strolled over to the table . " Are you ready to order ? " " Not quite yet , " said Ellen . " It all looks good . Are you ready , Matthew ? " " Not quite , " said Hooper . " Why do n't we have one more drink while we 're looking ? " " Both ? " said the waitress . Hooper seemed to ponder for a moment . Then he nodded his head and said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in silence , reading the menus . Ellen tried to assess how she felt . Three drinks would be a fairly heavy load for her to carry , and she wanted to make sure she did n't get fuzzy-headed or fuzzy-tongued . What was that saying , about alcohol increasing the desire but taking away from the performance ? But that 's just with men , she thought . I 'm glad I do n't have to worry about that . But what about him ? Suppose he ca n't . . . Is there anything I can do ? But that 's silly . Not on two drinks . It must take five or six or seven . A man has to be incapacitated . But not if he 's scared . Does he look scared ? She peeked over the top of her menu and looked at Hooper . He did n't look nervous . If anything , he looked slightly perplexed . " What 's the matter ? " she said . He looked up . " What do you mean ? " " Your eyebrows were all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nothing . I was just looking at the scallops , or what they claim are scallops . The chances are they 're flounder , cut up with a cookie cutter . " The waitress brought their drinks and said , " Ready ? "  | " Yes , " said Ellen . " I 'll have the shrimp cocktail and the chicken . " " What kind of dressing would you like on your salad ? We have French , Roquefort , Thousand Island , and oil and vine-gar . " " Roquefort , please . " Hooper said , " Are these really bay scallops ? " " I guess so , " said the waitress . " If that 's what it says . " " All right . I 'll have the scallops , and French dressing on the salad . " " Anything to start ? " " No , " said Hooper , raising his glass . " This 'll be fine . " In a few minutes , the waitress brought Ellen 's shrimp cocktail . When she had left , Ellen said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wine . " " That 's a very interesting idea , " Hooper said , looking at her . " But remember what I said about impetuousness . I may become irresponsible . " " I 'm not worried . " As Ellen spoke , she felt a blush crawl up her cheeks . " Okay , but first I better check the treasury . " He reached in his back pocket for his wallet . " Oh no . This is my treat . " " Do n't be silly . " " No , really . I asked you to lunch . " She began to panic . It had never occurred to her that he might insist on paying . She did n't want to annoy him by sticking him with a big bill . On the other hand , she did n't want to seem patronizing , to offendhis virility . " I know , " he said . " But I 'd like to take you to lunch . " Was this a gambit ? She could n't tell . If it was , she did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just being polite . . . " You 're sweet , " she said , " but ... "  | " I 'm serious . Please . " She looked down and toyed with the one shrimp remainingon her plate . " Well ... " " I know you 're only being thoughtful , " Hooper said , " but do n't be . Did n't David ever tell you about our grand-father ? " " Not that I remember . What about him ? " " Old Matt was known  --  and not very affectionately  --  as the Bandit . If he was alive today , I 'd probably be at the head of the pack calling for his scalp . But he is n't , so all I had to worry about was whether to keep the bundle of money he left me or give it away . It was n't a very difficult moral dilemma . I figure I can spend it as well as anyone I 'd give it to . " " Does David have a lot of money , too ? " " Yes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always baffledme . He 's got enough to support himself and any number of wives for life . So why did he settle on a meatball for a second wife ? Because she has more money than he does . I do n't know . Maybe money does n't feel comfortable unless it 's married to money . " " What did your grandfather do ? " " Railroads and mining . Technically , that is . Basically , he was a robber baron . At one point he owned most of Denver . He was the landlord of the whole red-light district . " " That must have been profitable . " " Not as much as you 'd think , " Hooper said with a laugh . " From what I hear , he liked to collect his rent in trade . " That might be a gambit , Ellen thought . What should she say ? " That 's supposed to be every schoolgirl 's fantasy , " she ventured playfully . " What is ? "  | " To be a . . . you know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different men . " " Was it yours ? " Ellen laughed , hoping to cover her blush . " I do n't rememberif it was exactly that , " she said . " But I guess we all have fantasies of one kind or another . " Hooper smiled and leaned back in his chair . He called the waitress over and said , " Bring us a bottle of cold chablis , would you please ? " Something 's happened , Ellen thought . She wondered if he could sense  --  smell ? like an animal ?  --  the invitation she had extended . Whatever it was , he had taken the offensive . All she had to do was avoid discouraging him . The food came , followed a moment later by the wine . Hooper 's scallops were the size of marshmallows . " Flounder , " he said after the waitress had left . " I should have known . " " How can you tell ? " Ellen asked . Immediately she wished she had n't said anything . She did n't want to let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one thing . And the edges are too perfect . They were obviously cut . " " I suppose you could send them back . " She hoped he would n't ; a quarrel with the waitress could spoil their mood . " I might , " said Hooper , and he grinned at Ellen . " Under different circumstances . " He poured Ellen a glass of wine , then filled his own and raised it for a toast . " To fantasies , " he said . " Tell me about yours . " His eyes were a bright , liquid blue , and his lips were parted in a half smile . Ellen laughed . " Oh , mine are n't very interesting . I imaginethey 're just your old run-of-the-mill fantasies . " " There 's no such thing , " said Hooper . " Tell me . " He was asking , not demanding , but Ellen felt that the game she had started demanded that she answer.  | " Oh , you know , " she said . Her stomach felt warm , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standard things . Rape , I guess , is one . " " How does it happen ? " She tried to think , and she remembered the times when , alone , she would let her mind wander and conjure the carnal images . Usually she was in bed , often with her husband asleep beside her . Sometimes she found that , without knowingit , she had been rubbing her hand over her vagina , caressing herself . " Different ways , " she said . " Name one . " " Sometimes I 'm in the kitchen in the morning , after everybody has left , and a workman from one of the houses next door comes to my back door . He wants to use the phone or have a glass of water . " She stopped . " And then ? " " I let him in the door and he threatens to kill me if I do n't do what he wants . " " Does he hurt you ? " " Oh no . I mean , he does n't stab me or anything . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He just . . . rapes me . " " Is it fun ? " " Not at first . It 's scary . But then , after a while , when he 's . . . " " When he 's got you all . . . ready . " Ellen 's eyes moved to his , reading the remark for humor , irony , or cruelty . She saw none . Hooper ran his tongue over his lips and leaned forward until his face was only a foot or so from hers . Ellen thought : The door 's open now ; all you have to do is walk through it . She said , " Yes . "  | " Then it 's fun . " " Yes . " She shifted in her seat , for the recollection was becomingphysical . " Do you ever have an orgasm ? " " Sometimes , " she said . " Not always . " " Is he big ? " " Tall ? Not ... " They had been speaking very softly , and now Hooper lowered his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tall . Is he .. . you know . . . big ? " " Usually , " said Ellen , and she chuckled . " Huge . " " Is he black ? " " No . I 've heard that some women have fantasies about being raped by black men , but I never have . " " Tell me another one . " " Oh no , " she said , laughing . " Now it 's your turn . " They heard footsteps and turned to see the waitressapproaching their table . " Is everything all right ? " she said . " Fine , " Hooper said curtly . " Everything 's fine . " The waitressleft . Ellen whispered , " Do you think she heard ? " Hooper leaned forward . " Not a chance . Now tell me another one . " It 's going to happen , Ellen thought , and she felt suddenly nervous . She wanted to tell him why she was behaving this way , to explain that she did n't do this all the time . He probably thinks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get sappy or you 'll ruin it . " No , " she said with a smile . " It 's your turn . " " Mine are usually orgies , " he said . " Or at least threesies . " " What are threesies ? " " Three people . Me and two girls . " " Greedy . What do you do ? " " It varies . Everything imaginable . "  | " Are you . . . big ? " she said . " Bigger every minute . What about you ? " " I do n't know . Compared to what ? " " To other women . Some women have really tight ones . " Ellen giggled . " You sound like a comparison-shopper . " " Just a conscientious consumer . " " I do n't know how I am , " she said . " I have n't anything to compare it to . " She looked down at her half-eaten chicken , and she laughed . " What 's funny ? " he asked . " I was just wondering , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was just wondering if  --  oh , Lord , I 'm getting a pain in my side  --  if chickens have ... " " Of course ! " said Hooper . " But talk about a tightie ! " They laughed together , and when the laughter faded , Ellen impulsively said , " Let 's make a fantasy . " " Okay . How do you want to start ? " " What would you do to me if we were going to . . . you know . " " That 's a very interesting question , " he said with mock gravity . " Before considering the what , however , we 'd have to consider the where . I suppose there 's always my room . " " Too dangerous . Everybody knows me at the Abelard . Anywhere in Amity would be too dangerous . " " What about your house ? " " Lord , no . Suppose one of my children came home . Besides . . . " " I know . No desecrating the conjugal sheets . Okay , where else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Montauk . Or even better , between here and Orient Point . " " Fair enough . Even if there 's not , there 's always the car . " " In broad daylight ? You do have wild fantasies . "  | " In fantasies , anything is possible . " " All right . That 's settled . So what would you do ? " " I think we should proceed chronologically . First of all , we 'd leave here in one car . Probably mine , because it 's least known . And we 'd come back later to pick up yours . " " Okay . " " Then , while we were driving along . . . no , even before that , before we left here , I 'd send you into the ladies ' roomand tell you to take off your panties . " " Why ? " " So I could . . . explore you while we 're on the road . Just to keep the motors running . " " I see , " she said , trying to seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that her mind was floating somewhereapart from her body . She was a third person listening to the conversation . She had to fight to keep from shifting on the Leatherette bench . She wanted to squirm back and forth , to move her thighs up and down . But she was afraid of leaving a stain on the seat . " Then , " said Hooper , " while we were driving along , you might be sitting on my right hand and I 'd be giving you a massage . Maybe I 'd have my fly open . Maybe not , though , because you might get ideas , which would undoubtedly cause me to lose control , and that would probably cause a massive accident that would leave us both dead . " Ellen started to giggle again , imagining the sight of Hooper lying by the side of the road , stiff as a flagpole , and herself lying next to him , her dress bunched up around her waist and her vagina yawning open , glistening wet , for the world to see . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " where the rooms are either in separate cabins or at least not butted right up against each other , wall to wall . "  | " Why ? " " Noise . The walls are usually made of Kleenex and spit , and we would n't want to be inhibited by the thought of a shoe salesman in the next room pressing his ear to the wall and getting his kicks listening to us . " " Suppose you could n't find a motel like that . " " We would , " said Hooper . " As I said , in a fantasy anythingis possible . " Why does he keep saying that ? Ellen thought . He ca n't really be playing a word game , working up a fantasy he has no intention of fulfilling . Her mind scrambled for a question to keep the conversation alive . " What name would you register us under ? " " Ah yes . I 'd forgotten . These days I ca n't conceive of anyonegetting uptight about something like this , but you 're right : we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into an old-fashioned innkeeper . How about Mr. and Mrs. Al Kinsey . We could say we were on an extended field trip for re-search . " " And we 'd tell him we 'd send him an autographed copy of our report . " " We 'd dedicate it to him ! " They both laughed , and Ellen said , " What about after we registered ? " " Well , we 'd drive to wherever our room was , scout around to see if anyone seemed to be in the rooms nearby  --  unless we had a cabin to ourselves  --  and then go inside . " " And then ? " " That 's when our options broaden . I 'd probably be so turned on that I 'd grab you , let you have it  --  maybe on the bed , maybe not . That time would be my time . Your time would come later . " " What do you mean ? "  | " The first time would be out of control  --  a **27;674;TOOLONG . After that , I 'd have more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " How would you do that ? " " With delicacy and finesse . " The waitress was approaching the table , so they sat back and stopped talking . " Will there be anything else ? " " No , " said Hooper . " Just the check . " Ellen assumed that the waitress would return to the bar to total the bill , but she stood at the table , scribbling and carrying her ones . Ellen slid to the edge of the seat and said as she stood up , " Excuse me . I want to powder my nose before we go . " " I know , " said Hooper , smiling . " You do ? " said the waitress as Ellen passed her . " Boy , that 's what marriage will do for you . I hope nobody ever knows me that well . " Ellen arrived home a little before 4:30 . She went upstairs , into the bathroom , and turned on the water in the tub . She took off all her clothes and stuffed them into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the hamper . She looked in the mirror and examined her face and neck . No marks . After her bath , she powdered herself , brushed her teeth , and gargled with mouthwash . She went into the bedroom , put on a fresh pair of underpants and a nightgown , pulled back the bedclothes and climbed into bed . She closed her eyes , hoping that sleep would pounce upon her . But sleep could not overpower a memory that kept sliding into her mind . It was a vision of Hooper , eyes wide and staring  --  but unseeing  --  at the wall as he approached climax.  |p174The  eyes seemed to bulge until , just before release , Ellen had feared they might actually pop out of their sockets . Hooper 's teeth were clenched , and he ground them the way people do during sleep . From his voice there came a gurglingwhine , whose tone rose higher and higher with each frenzied thrust . Even after his obvious , violent climax , Hooper 's countenance had not changed . His teeth were still clenched , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued to pump madly . He was oblivious of the being beneath him , and when , perhaps a full minute after his climax , Hooper still did not relax , Ellen had become afraid  --  of what , she was n't sure , but the ferocity and intensity of his assault seemed to her a pursuit in which she was only a vehicle . After a while , she had tapped him on the back and said softly , " Hey , I 'm here too , " and in a moment his eyelids closed and his head dropped to her shoulder . Later , during their subsequent coupling , Hooper had been more gentle , more controlled , less detached . But the fury of the first encounterstill lingered disturbingly in Ellen 's mind . Finally , her mind gave in to fatigue , and she fell asleep . Almost instantly , it seemed , she was awakened by a voice that said , " Hey there , are you okay ? " She opened her eyes and saw Brody sitting on the end of the bed . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Almost six . " " Oh-oh . I 've got to pick up Sean . Phyllis Santos must be having a fit . " " I got him , " said Brody . " I figured I 'd better , once I could n't reach you . " " You tried to reach me ? " " A couple of times . I tried you at the hospital at around two . They said they thought you 'd come home . "  | " That 's right . I did . I felt awful . My thyroid pills are n't doing what they should . So I came home . " " Then I tried to reach you here . " " My , it must have been important . " " No , it was nothing important . If you must know , I was calling to apologize for whatever I did that got you upset last night . " A twinge of shame struck Ellen , but it passed , and she said , " You 're sweet , but do n't worry . I 'd already forgotten about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He waited a moment to see if she was going to say anything else , and when it was clear she was n't , he said , " So where were you ? " " I told you , here ! " The words came out more harshly than she had intended . " I came home and went to bed , and that 's where you found me . " " And you did n't hear the phone ? It 's right there . " Brody pointed to the bed table near the other side of the bed . " No , I . . . " She started to say she had turned the phone off , but then she remembered that this particular phone could n't be turned off all the way . " I took a pill . The moaning of the damned wo n't wake me after I 've taken one of those pills . " Brody shook his head . " I really am going to throw those damn things down the john . You 're turning into a junkie . " He stood and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the toilet seat and begin to urinate  --  a loud , powerful , steady stream that went on and on and on . She smiled . Until today , she had assumed Brody was some kind of urinary freak : he could go for almost a day without urinating . Then , when he did pee , he seemed to pee forever . Long ago , she had concluded that his bladder was the size of a watermelon . Now she knew that huge bladderp176capacity was simply a male trait . Now , she said to herself , I am a woman of the world . " Have you heard from Hooper ? " Brody called over the noise of the endless stream . Ellen thought for a moment about her response , then said , " He called this morning , just to say thank you . Why ? " " I tried to get hold of him today , too . Around midday and a couple of times during the afternoon . The hotel said they did n't know where he was . What time did he call here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Did he say what he was going to be doing ? " " He said . . . he said he might try to work on the boat , I think . I really do n't remember . " " Oh . That 's funny . " " What is ? " " I stopped by the dock on my way home . The harbor master said he had n't seen Hooper all day . " " Maybe he changed his mind . " " He was probably shagging Daisy Wicker in some hotel room . " Ellen heard the stream slow , then dwindle into droplets . Then she heard the toilet flush.  |p177On  Thursday morning Brody got a call summoning him to Vaughan 's office for a noon meeting of the Board of Selectmen . He knew what the subject of the meeting was : opening the beaches for the Fourth of July weekend that would beginthe day after tomorrow . By the time he left his office for the town hall , he had marshaled and examined every argument he could think of . He knew his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caution , and an abiding , gnawing guilt . But Brody was convinced he was right . Opening the beaches would not be a solution or a conclusion . It would be a gamblethat Amity  --  and Brody  --  could never really win . They would never know for certain that the shark had gone away . They would be living from day to day , hoping for a continuingdraw . And one day , Brody was sure , they would lose . The town hall stood at the head of Main Street , where Main dead-ended and was crossed by Water Street . The building was a crown at the top of the T formed by Main and Water streets . It was an imposing , pseudo-Georgian affair  --  red brick with white trim and two white columns framing the entrance . A World War II howitzer sat on thep178lawn in front of the town hall , a memorial to the citizens of Amity who had served in the war . The building had been given to the town in the late 192os by an investment banker who had somehow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commerce on eastern Long Island . He felt that the town 's public officials should work in a building befitting their destiny  --  not , as had been the case until then , conducting the town 's business in a tiny suite of airless rooms above a saloon called the Mill . ( In February , 1930 , the distraught banker , who had proved no more adept at predicting his own destiny than Amity 's , tried , unsuccessfully , to reclaim the building , insisting he had intended only to loan it to the town . ) The rooms inside the town hall were as preposterously grandiose as the exterior . They were huge and high-ceilinged , each with its own elaborate chandelier . Rather than pay to remodel the interior into small cubicles , successive Amity administrations had simply jammed more and more people into each room . Only the mayor was still permitted to perform his part-time duties in solitary splendor . Vaughan 's office was on the southeast corner of the secondfloor , overlooking most of the town and , in the distance , the Atlantic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman named Janet Sumner , sat at a desk outside the mayor 's office . Though he saw her seldom , Brody was paternally fond of Janet , and he was idly mystified that  --  aged about twentysix  --  shewas still unmarried . He usually made a point of inquiringabout her love life before he entered Vaughan 's office . Today he said simply , " Are they all insider ' " All that 's coming . " Brody started into the office , and Janet said , " Do n't you want to know who I 'm going out with ? "  |p179He  stopped , smiled , and said , " Sure . I 'm sorry . My mind 's a mess today . So who is it ? " " Nobody . I 'm in temporary retirement . But I 'll tell you one thing . " She lowered her voice and leaned forward . " I would n't mind playing footsie with that Mr. Hooper . " " Is he in there ? " Janet nodded . " I wonder when he was elected selectman . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But he sure is cute . " " Sorry , Jan , he 's spoken for . " " By who ? " " Daisy Wicker . " Janet laughed . " What 's funny ? I just broke your heart . " " You do n't know about Daisy Wicker ? " " I guess I do n't . " Again Janet lowered her voice . " She 's queer . She 's got a lady roommate and everything . , She 's not even AC-DC . She 's just plain old DC . " " I 'll be damned , " said Brody . " You sure do have an interestingjob , Jan . " As he entered the office , Brody said to himself : Okay , so where the hell was Hooper yesterday ? As soon as he was inside the office , Brody knew he would be fighting alone . The only selectmen present were longtime friends and allies of Vaughan 's : Tony Catsoulis , a builder who looked like a fire hydrant ; Ned Thatcher , a frail old man whose family had owned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , owner of Amity Liquors ; and Rafe Lopez ( pronounced loaps ) , a dark-skinned Portugueseelected to the board by , and a vocal defender of , the town 's black community . The four selectmen sat around a coffee table at one end of the immense room . Vaughan sat at his desk at the otherp180end of the room . Hooper stood at a southerly window , staringout at the sea . " Where 's Albert Morris ? " Brody said to Vaughan after perfunctorily greeting the others . " He could n't make it , " said Vaughan . " I do n't think he felt well . " " And Fred Potter ? " " Same thing . There must be a bug going around . " Vaughan stood up . " Well , I guess we 're all here . Grab a chair and pull it over by the coffee table . " God , he looks awful , Brody thought as he watched Vaughan drag a straight-back chair across the room . Vaughan 's eyes were sunken and dark . His skin looked like mayonnaise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided , or else he has n't slept in a month . When everyone was seated , Vaughan said , " You all know why we 're here . And I guess it 's safe to say that there 's only one of us that needs convincing about what we should do . " " You mean me , " said Brody . Vaughan nodded . " Look at it from our point of view , Martin . The town is dying . People are out of work . Stores that were going to open are n't . People are n't renting houses , let alone buying them . And every day we keep the beaches closed , we drive another nail into our own coffin . We 're saying , officially , this town is unsafe : stay away from here . And people are listening . " " Suppose you do open the beaches for the Fourth , Larry , " said Brody . " And suppose someone gets killed . " " It 's a calculated risk , but I think  --  we think  --  it 's worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mr. Hooper ? "  | " Several reasons , " said Hooper . " First of all , nobody 's seen the fish in a week . " " Nobody 's been in the water , either . " " That 's true . But I 've been on the boat looking for him every day  --  every day but one . " " I meant to ask you about that . Where were you yester-day ? " " It rained , " said Hooper . " Remember ? " " So what did you do ? " " I just . . . " He paused momentarily , then said , " I studied some water samples . And read . " " Where ? In your hotel room ? " " Part of the time , yeah . What are you driving at ? " " I called your hotel . They said you were out all after-noon . " " So I was out ! " Hooper said angrily . " I do n't have to reportin every five minutes , do I ? " " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not go galavantingaround all those country clubs you used to belong to . " " Listen , mister , you 're not paying me . I can do whatever the fuck I want ! " Vaughan broke in . " Come on . This is n't getting anybody anywhere . " " Anyway , " said Hooper , " I have n't seen a trace of thatfish . Not a sign . Then there 's the water . It 's getting warmerevery day . It 's almost seventy now . As a rule  --  I know , rulesare made to be broken  --  great whites prefer cooler water . " " So you think he 's gone farther north ? " " Or out deeper , into colder water . He could even have gone south . You ca n't predict what these things are going to do . " " That 's my point , " said Brody . " You ca n't predict it . So all you 're doing is guessing . "  |p182Vaughan  said , " You ca n't ask for a guarantee , Martin . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's mother . " " I know , I know , " Vaughan said impatiently . " But we have to do something . We ca n't sit around waiting for divine revelation . God is n't going to scribble across the sky , The shark is gone . ' We have to weigh the evidence and make a decision . " Brody nodded . " I guess . So what else has the boy genius come up with ? " " What 's the matter with you ? " said Hooper . " I was asked for my opinion . " " Sure , " said Brody . " Okay . What else ? " " What we 've known all along . That there 's no reason for that fish to hang around here . I have n't seen him . The Coast Guard has n't seen him . No new reef has popped up from the bottom . No garbage scows are dumping stuff into the water . No extraordinary fish life is around . There 's just no reason for him to be here . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was here . " " That 's true . I ca n't explain it . I doubt if anyone can . " " An act of God , then ? " " If you like . " " And there 's no insurance against acts of God , is there , Larry ? " " I do n't know what you 're getting at , Martin , " said Vaughan . " But we 've got to make a decision . As far as I 'm concerned , there 's only one way to go . " " The decision 's been made , " said Brody . " You could say that , yes . " " And when someone else gets killed ? Who 's taking the blame this time ? Who 's going to talk to the husband or thep183mother or the wife and tell them , We were just playing the odds , and we lost ' ? " " Do n't be so negative , Martin . When the time comes  --  if the time comes , and I 'm betting it wo n't  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , goddammit ! I 'm sick of taking all the shit for your mistakes . " ' Wait a minute , Martin . " " I 'm serious . If you want the authority for closing the beaches , then you take the responsibility , too . " " What are you saying ? " " I 'm saying that as long as I 'm chief of police in this town , as long as I 'm supposed to be responsible for public safety , those beaches will not be open . " " I 'll tell you this , Martin , " said Vaughan . " If those beaches stay closed over the Fourth of July weekend , you wo n't have your job very long . And I 'm not threatening . I 'm telling you . We can still have a summer . But we have to tell people it 's safe to come here . Twenty minutes after they hear you wo n't open the beaches , the people of this town will impeachyou , or find a rail and run you out on it . Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Catsoulis . " I 'll give ' em the rail myself . " " My people got no work , " said Lopez . " You do n't let them work , you 're not gon na work . " Brody said flatly , " You can have my job any time you want it . " A buzzer sounded on Vaughan 's desk . He stood up angrily and crossed the room . He picked up the phone . " I told you we did n't want to be disturbed ! " he snapped . There was a moment 's silence , and he said to Brody , " There 's a call for you . Janet says it 's urgent . You can take it here or outside . "  | " I 'll take it outside , " Brody said , wondering what could be urgent enough to call him out of a meeting with the selectmen . Another attack ? He left the room and closed the door behind him . Janet handed him the phone on her desk , but before she could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Brody said , " Tell me : Did Larry ever call Albert Morris and Fred Potter this morning ? " Janet looked away from him . " I was told not to say anything about anything to anybody . " " Tell me , Janet . I need to know . " " Will you put in a good word for me with Golden Boy in there ? " " It 's a deal . " " No . The only ones I called were the four in there . " " Push the button . " Janet pushed the button , and Brody said , " Brody . " Inside his office , Vaughan saw the light stop flashing , and1 he gently eased his finger off the receiver hook and placed his hand over the mouthpiece . He looked around the room , searching each face for a challenge . No one returned his gaze  --  not even Hooper , who had decided that the less he was involved in the affairs of Amity , the better off he would be . " It 's Harry , Martin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a meeting and I know you 've got to get back to it . So just listen . I 'll be brief . Larry Vaughan is up to his tail in hock . " " I do n't believe it . " " Listen , I said ! The fact that he 's in debt does n't mean anything . It 's who he 's in debt to that matters . A long time ago , maybe twenty-five years , before Larry had any money , his wife got sick . I do n't remember what she had , but it was serious . And expensive . My memory 's a little hazy on this , but I remember him saying afterward that he had beenp185helped out by a friend , gotten a loan to pull him through . It must have been for several thousand dollars . Larry told me the man 's name . I would n't have thought anything about it , but Larry said something about the man being willing to help out people in trouble . I was young then , and I did n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the name and stuck it away in my files . It never occurred to me to look it up again until you asked me to start snooping . The name was Tino Russo . " " Get to the point , Harry . " " I am . Now jump to the present . A couple of months ago , before this shark thing ever began , a company was formed called Caskata Estates . It 's a holding company . At the beginning , it had no real assets . The first thing it bought was a big potato field just north of Scotch Road . When the summerdid n't shape up well , Caskata began to buy a few more properties . It was all perfectly legitimate . The company obviouslyhas cash behind it  --  somewhere  --  and it was taking advantage of the down market to pick up properties at low prices . But then  --  as soon as the first newspaper reports about the shark thing came out  --  Caskata really started buying . The lower real estate prices fell , the more they bought . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's almost like duringthe war , and Caskata 's still buying . Very little money down . All short-term promissory notes . Signed by Larry Vaughan , who is listed as the president of Caskata . The executive vice-president of Caskata Estates is Tino Russo , who the Times has been listing for years as a secondecheloncrumb in one of the five Mafia families in New York . " Brody whistled through his teeth . " And the sonofabitch has been moaning about how nobody 's been buying any/thing from him . I still do n't understand why he 's being pressuredto open the beaches . " " I 'm not sure . I 'm not even sure he 's still being pressured . He may be arguing out of personal desperation . I imagine he 's way overextended . He could n't buy anything more no matter how low the prices go . The only way he can get out without being ruined is if the market turns around and the prices go up . Then he can sell what he 's bought and get the profit . Or Russo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . If prices keep going down  --  in other words , if the town is still officially unsafe  --  his notes are going to come due . He ca n't possibly meet them . He 's probably got over half a million out now in cash down payments . He 'll lose his cash , and the properties will either revert to the original owners or else get picked up by Russo if he can raise the cash . I do n't imagine Russo would want to take the risk . Prices might keep going down , and then he 'd take a bath along with Vaughan . My guess is that Russo still has hopes of big profits , but the only way he has a chance of getting them is if Vaughan forces the beaches open . Then , if nothing happens  --  if the shark does n't kill anybody else  --  before long prices will go up and Vaughan can sell out . Russo will take his cut  --  half the gross or whatever  --  and Caskata will be dissolved . Vaughan will get what 's left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If the shark does kill someone else , then the only one who gets screwed is Vaughan . As far as I can tell , Russo does n't have a nickel in cash in this outfit . It 's all  --  " " You 're a goddamned liar , Meadows ! " Vaughan 's voice shrieked into the phone . " You print one word of that crap and Ill sue you to death ! " There was a click as Vaughan slammed down the phone.  | " So much for the integrity of our elected officials , " said Meadows . " What are you going to do , Harry ? Can you print any-thing ? " " No , at least not yet . I ca n't document enough . You know as well as I do that the mob is getting more and more involved in Long Island  --  the construction business , restaurants , everything . But it 's hard as hell to prove an actual illegality . In Vaughan 's case , I 'm not sure there 's anything illegal going on , in the strict sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little more digging , I should be able to put togethera piece saying that Vaughan has been associating with a known mobster . I mean a piece that will hold up if Vaughan ever did try to sue . " " It sounds to me like you 've got enough now , " said Brody . " I have the knowledge , but not the proof . I do n't have the documents , or even copies of them . I 've seen them , but that 's all . " " Do you think any of the selectmen are in on the deal ? Larry loaded this meeting against me . " " No . You mean Catsoulis and Conover ? They 're just old buddies who owe Larry a favor or two . If Thatcher 's there , he 's too old and too scared to say a word against Larry . And Lopez is straight . He 's really concerned about jobs for his people . " " Does Hooper know any of this ? He 's making a pretty strong case for opening the beaches . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't . I only wrapped it up myselfa few minutes ago , and there are still a lot of loose threads . " " What do you think I ought to do ? I may have quit already . I offered them my job before I came out to take your call . "  | " Christ , do n't quit . First of all , we need you . If you quit , Russo will get together with Vaughan and handpick your successor . You may think all your troops are honest , but I 'll bet Russo could find one who would n't mind exchanging a little integrity for a few dollars  --  or even just for a shot at the chief 's job . " " So where does that leave me ? " " If I were you , I 'd open the beaches . " " For God 's sake , Harry , that 's what they want ! I might as well go on their payroll . " " You said yourself that there 's a strong argument for opening the beaches . I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open them sometime , even if we never see that fish again . You might as well do it now . " " And let the mob take their money and run . " " What else can you do ? You keep them closed , and Vaughan 'll find a way to get rid of you and he 'll open them himself . Then you 'll be no use whatever . To anybody . At least this way , if you open the beaches and nothing happens , the town might have a chance . Then , maybe later , we can find a way to pin something on Vaughan . I do n't know what , but maybe there 'll be something . " " Shit , " said Brody . " All right , Harry , I 'll think about it . But if I open them , I 'm gon na do it my way . Thanks for the call . " He hung up and went into Vaughan 's office . Vaughan was standing at the southerly window , his back to the door . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The meeting 's over . " " What do you mean , over ? " said Catsoulis . " We ai n't decideda fuckin ' thing . " Vaughan spun around and said , " It 's over , Tony ! Do n't give me any trouble . It 'll work out the way we want . Justp189give me a chance to have a little chat with the chief . Okay ? Now everybody out . " Hooper and the four selectmen left the office . Brody watched Vaughan as he ushered them out . He knew he should feel pity for Vaughan , but he could n't suppress the contempt that flowed over him . Vaughan shut the door , walked over to the couch , and sat down heavily . He rested his elbows on his knees and rubbed his temples with his fingertips . " We were friends , Martin , " he said . " I hope we can be again . " " How much of what Meadows said is true ? " " I wo n't tell you . I ca n't . Suffice it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me and now he wants me to repay the favor . " " In other words , all of it . " Vaughan looked up , and Brody saw that his eyes were red and wet . " I swear to you , Martin , if I had any idea how far this would go , I 'd never have gotten into it . " " How much are you into him for ? " " The original amount was ten thousand . I tried to pay it back twice , a long time ago , but I could never get them to cash my checks . They kept saying it was a gift , not to worry about it . But they never gave me back my marker . When they came to me a couple of months ago , I offered them a hundred thousand dollars  --  cash . They said it was n't enough . They did n't want the money . They wanted me to make a few investments . Everybody 'd be a winner , they said . " " And how much are you out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have . More than every cent . Probably close to a million dollars . " Vaughan took a deep breath . " Can you help me , Martin ? " " The only thing I can do for you is put you in touch with the D.A . If you 'd testify , you might be able to slap a loansharkingrap on these guys . "  | " I 'd be dead before I got home from the D.A . ' s office , and Eleanor would be left without anything . That 's not the kind of help I meant . " " I know . " Brody looked down at Vaughan , a huddled , wounded animal , and he did feel compassion for him . He began to doubt his own opposition to opening the beaches . How much of it was the residue of prior guilt , how much fear of another attack ? How much was he indulging himself , playing it safe , and how much was prudent concern for the town ? " I 'll tell you what , Larry . I 'll open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm sure if I did n't open them you 'd find a way to get rid of me and open them yourself . I 'll open the beaches because I 'm not sure I 'm right any more . " " Thanks , Martin . I appreciate that . " " I 'm not finished . Like I said , I 'll open them . But I 'm going to post men on the beaches . And I 'm going to have Hooper patrol in the boat . And I 'm going to make sure every person who comes down there knows the danger . " " You ca n't do that ! " Vaughan said . " You might as well leave the damn things closed . " " I can do it , Larry , and I will . " " What are you going to do ? Post signs warning of a killer shark ? Put an ad in the newspaper saying Beaches Open  --  Stay Away ' ? Nobody 's going to go to the beach if it 's crawlingwith cops . " " I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm not going to make believe nothing ever happened . " " All right , Martin . " Vaughan rose . " You do n't leave me much choice . If I got rid of you , you 'd probably go down to the beach as a private citizen and run up and down yelling Shark ! ' So all right . But be subtle  --  if not for my sake , for the town's. "  |p191Brody  left the office . As he walked down the stairs , he looked at his watch . It was past one o'clock , and he was hungry . He went down Water Street to Loeffler 's , Amity 's only delicatessen . It was owned by Paul Loeffler , a classmate of Brody 's in high school . As Brody pulled open the glass door , he heard Loeffler say , " . . . like a goddam dictator , if you ask me . I do n't know what 's his problem . " When he saw Brody , Loe GO er blushed . He had been a skinny kid in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over his father 's business , he had succumbedto the terrible temptations that surrounded him for twelve hours of every day of every week , and nowadays he looked like a pear . Brody smiled . " You were n't talking about me , were you , Paulie ? " " What makes you think that ? " said Loeffler , his blush deepening . " Nothing . Never mind . If you 'll make me a ham and Swiss on rye with mustard , I 'll tell you something that will make you happy . " " That I have to hear . " Loeffler began to assemble Brody 's sandwich . " I 'm going to open the beaches for the Fourth . " " That makes me happy . " " Business bad ? " " Bad . " " Business is always bad with you . " " Not like this . If it does n't get better soon , I 'm gon na be the cause of a race riot . " " What do you mean ? " " I 'm supposed to hire two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But I ca n't afford two . Let alone I don'tp192have enough work for two , the way things are . So I can only hire one . One 's white and one 's black . " " Which one are you hiring ? " " The black one . I figure he needs the money more . I just thank God the white one is n't Jewish . " Brody arrived home at 5:10 . As he pulled into the driveway , the back door to the house opened , and Ellen ran toward him . She had been crying , and she was still visibly upset . " What 's the matter ? " he said . " Thank God you 're home . I tried to reach you at work , but you had already left . Come here . Quick . " She took him by the hand and led him past the back door to the shed where they kept the garbage cans . " In there , " she said , pointing to a can . " Look . " Brody removed the lid from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bag of garbage was Sean 's cat  --  a big , husky torn named Frisky . The cat 's head had been twisted completely around , and the yellow eyes overlooked its back . " How the hell did that happen ? " said Brody . " A car ? " " No , a man . " Ellen 's breath came in sobs . " A man did it to him . Sean was right there when it happened . The man got out of a car over by the curb . He picked up the cat and twisted its head until the neck broke . Sean said it made a horrible snap . Then he dropped the cat on the lawn and got back in his car and drove away . " " Did he say anything ? " " I do n't know . Sean 's inside . He 's hysterical , and I do n't blame him . Martin , what 's happening ? " Brody slammed the top back on the can . " God damn sonofabitch ! " he said . His throat felt tight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both sides of his jaw . " Let 's go inside . " Five minutes later , Brody marched out the back door . He tore the lid off the garbage can and threw it aside . He reached in and pulled out the cat 's corpse . He took it to his car , pitched it through the open window , and climbed in . He backed out of the driveway and screeched away . A hundred yards down the road , in a burst of fury , he turned on his siren . It took him only a couple of minutes to reach Vaughan 's house , a large , Tudor-style stone mansion on Sprain Drive , just off Scotch Road . He got out of the car , dragging the dead cat by one of its hind legs , mounted the front steps , and rang the bell . He hoped Eleanor Vaughan would n't answer the door . The door opened , and Vaughan said , " Hello , Martin . I .. Brody raised the cat and pushed it toward Vaughan 's face . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ widened . " What do you mean ? I do n't know what you 're talking about ? " " One of your friends did this . Right in my front yard , right in front of my kid . They murdered my fucking cat ! Did you tell them to do that ? " " Do n't be crazy , Martin . " Vaughan seemed genuinely shocked . " I 'd never do anything like that . Never . " Brody lowered the cat and said , " Did you call your friends after I left ? " " Well . . . yes . But just to say that the beaches would be open tomorrow . " " That 's all you said ? " " Yes . Why ? "  | " You lying fuck ! " Brody hit Vaughan in the chest with the cat and let it fall to the floor . " You know what the guy said after he strangled my cat ? You know what he told my eight-year-old boy ? " " No . Of course I do n't know . How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing you did . He said : Tell your old man this  --  " Be subtle . ' " Brody turned and walked down the steps , leaving Vaughan standing over the gnarled bundle of bone and fur.  |p195Friday  was cloudy , with scattered light showers , and the only people who swam were a young couple who took a quick dip early in the morning just as Brody 's man arrived at the beach . Hooper patrolled for six hours and saw nothing . On Friday night Brody called the Coast Guard for a weather report . He was n't sure what he hoped to hear . He knew he should wish for beautiful weather for the three-day holiday weekend . It would bring people to Amity and if nothing happened , if nothing was sighted , by Tuesday he might begin to believe the shark had gone . If nothing happened . Privately , he would have welcomed a three-day blow that would keep the beaches clear over the weekend . Either way , he begged his personal deities not to let anything happen . He wanted Hooper to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hooper was always there , the expert voice to contradicthis caution . Brody sensed that somehow Hooper had come into his home . He knew Ellen had talked to Hooper since the party : young Martin had mentioned something about the possibility of Hooper taking them on a beach picnic to look for shells . Then there was that business on Wednesday . Ellen had said she was sick , and she certainly had looked worn out when he came home . But where hadp196Hooper been that day ? Why had he been so evasive when Brody had asked him about it ? For the first time in his married life , Brody was wondering , and the wondering filled him with an uncomfortable ambivalence  --  sell-reproach for questioning Ellen , and fear that there might actually be something to wonder about . The weather report was for clear and sunny , southwest winds five to ten knots . Well , Brody thought , maybe that 's for the best . If we have a good weekend and nobody gets hurt , maybe I can believe . And Hooper 's sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as soon as he talked to the Coast Guard . He was standing at the kitchen phone . Ellen was washing the supper dishes . Brody knew Hooper was staying at the Abelard Arms . He saw the phone book buried beneath a pile of bills , note pads , and comic books on the kitchen counter . He started to reach for it , then stopped . " I have to call Hooper , " he said . " You know where the phone book is ? " " It 's six-five-four-three , " said Ellen . " What is ? " " The Abelard . That 's the number : six-five-four-three . " " How do you know ? " " I have a memory for phone numbers . You know that . I always have . " He did know it , and he cursed himself for playing stupid tricks . He dialed the number . " Abelard Arms . " It was a male voice , young . The night clerk . " Matt Hooper 's room , please . " " You do n't happen to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Brody cupped his hand over the mouthpiece and said to Ellen , " You do n't happen to know the room number , do you ? "  |p197She  looked at him , and for a second she did n't answer . Then she shook her head . The clerk said , " Here it is . Four-oh-five . " The phone rang twice before Hooper answered . " This is Brody . " " Yeah . Hi . " Brody faced the wall , trying to imagine what the room looked like . He conjured visions of a small dark garret , a rumpled bed , stains on the sheets , the smells of rut . He felt , briefly , that he was going out of his mind . " I guess we 're on for tomorrow , " he said . " The weather report is good . " " Yeah , I know . " " Then I 'll see you down at the dock . " " What time ? " " Nine-thirty , I guess . Nobody 's going to go swimming before then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Oh hey , by the way , " Brody said , " how did things work out with Daisy Wicker ? " " What ? " Brody wished he had n't asked the question . " Nothing . I was just curious . You know , about whether you two hit it off . " " Well . . . yeah , now that you mention it . Is that part of your job , to check up on people 's sex lifer ' " Forget it . Forget I ever mentioned it . " He hung up the phone . Liar , he thought . What the hell is going on here ? He turned to Ellen . " I meant to ask you , Martin said something about a beach picnic . When 's that ? " " No special time , " she said . " It was just a thought . " " Oh . " He looked at her , but she did n't return the glance . " I think it 's time you got some sleep . " " Why do you say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well . And that 's the second time you 've washed that glass . " He took a beer from the refrigerator . He yanked the metal tab and it broke off in his hand . " Fuck ! " he said , and he threw the full can into the wastebasket and marched out of the room . Saturday noon , Brody stood on a dune overlooking the Scotch Road beach , feeling half secret agent , half fool . He was wearing a polo shirt and a bathing suit : he had had to buy one specially for this assignment . He was chagrined at his white legs , nearly hairless after years of chafing in long pants . He wished Ellen had come with him , to make him feel less conspicuous , but she had begged off , claiming that since he was n't going to be home over the weekend , this would be a good time to catch up on her housework . In a beach bag by Brody 's side were a pair of binoculars , a walkie-talkie , two beers , and a cellophane-wrapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mile , the Flicka moved slowly eastward . Brody watched the boat and said to himself : At least I know where he is today . The Coast Guard had been right : the day was splendid cloudless and warm , with a light onshore breeze . The beach was not crowded . A dozen teen-agers were scattered about in their ritual rows . A few couples lay dozing  --  motionless as corpses , as if to move would disrupt the cosmic rhythms that generated a tan . A family was gathered around a charcoal fire in the sand , and the scent of grilling hamburger drifted into Brody 's nose . No one had yet gone swimming . Twice , different sets of parents had led their children to the water 's edge and allowed them to wade in the wavewash , but after a few minutes  --  bored or fearful  --  the parents had ordered the childrenback up the beach.  |p199Brody  heard footsteps crackling in the beach grass behind him , and he turned around . A man and a woman  --  in their late forties , probably , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dragging two complaining children behind them . The man wore khakis , a T-shirt , and basketball sneakers . The woman wore a print dress that rode up her wrinkled thighs . In her hand she carried a pair of sandals . Behind them Brody saw a Winnebago camper parked on Scotch Road . " Can I help you ? " Brody said when the couple had reached the top of the dune . " Is this the beach ? " said the woman . " What beach are you looking for ? The public beach is  --  " " This is it , awright , " said the man , pulling a map out of his pocket . He spoke with the unmistakable accent of the Queensborough New Yorker . " We turned off Twenty-seven and followed this road here . This is it , awright . " " So where 's the shark ? " said one of the children , a fat boy of about thirteen . " I thought you said we were gon na see a shark . " " Shut up , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's this hotshot shark ? " " What shark ? " " The shark that 's killed all them people . I seen it on TV  --  on three different channels . There 's a shark that kills people . Right here . " " There was a shark here , " said Brody . " But it is n't here now . And with any luck , it wo n't come back . " The man stared at Brody for a second and then snarled , " You mean we drove all the way out here to see this shark and he 's gone ? That 's not what the TV said . " " I ca n't help that , " said Brody . " I do n't know who told youp200you were going to see that shark . They do n't just come up on the beach and shake hands , you know . " " Do n't smart-mouth me , buddy . " Brody stood up . " Listen , mister , " he said , pulling his wallet from the belt of his bathing suit and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm the chief of police in this town . I do n't know who you are , or who you think you are , but you do n't march onto a private beach in Amity and start behaving like a bum . Now state your business or beat it . " The man stopped posturing . " Sorry , " he said . " It 's just after all that goddam traffic and the kids screaming in my ear , I thought at least we 'd get a look at the shark . That 's what we come all the way out here for . " " You drove two and a half hours to see a shark ? Why ? " " Something to do . Last weekend we went to Jungle Habitat . We thought maybe this weekend we 'd go to the jersey Shore . But then we heard about the shark out here . The kids never seen a shark before . " " Well , I hope they do n't see one today , either . " " Shit , " said the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " whined one of the boys . " Shut your mouth , Benny ! " The man turned back to Brody . " Is it okay if we have lunch here ? " Brody knew he could order the people down to the public beach , but without a resident 's parking sticker they would have to park their camper more than a mile from the beach , so he said , " I guess so . If somebody complains , you 'll have to move , but I doubt anyone will complain today . Go ahead . But do n't leave anything  --  not a gum wrapper or a matchstick  --  onthe beach , or I 'll slap a ticket on you for littering . " " Okay . " The man said to his wife , " You got the cooler ? " " I left it in the camper , " she said . " I did n't know we 'd be staying . "  | " Shit . " The man trudged down the dune , panting . The woman and her two children walked twenty or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked at his watch : 12:15 . He reached into the beach bag and took out the walkie-talkie . He pushed a buttonand said , " You there , Leonard ? " Then he released the button . In a moment the reply came back , rasping through the speaker . " I read you , Chief . Over . " Hendricks had volunteered to spend the weekend on the public beach , as the third point in the triangle of watch . ( " You 're getting to be a regular beach bum , " Brody had said when Hendricks volunteered . Hendricks had laughed and said , " Sure , Chief . If you 're going to live in a place like this , you might as well become a beautiful people . " ) " What 's up ? " said Brody . " Anything going on ? " " Nothing we ca n't handle , but there is a little problem . People keep coming up to me and trying to give me tickets . Over . " " Tickets for what ? " " To get onto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town that allow them to come onto the Amity beach . You should see the damn things . I got one right here . It says Shark Beach . Admit One . Two-fifty . ' All I can figure is some sharpie is making a pretty fine killing selling people tickets they do n't need . Over . " " What 's their reaction when you turn down their tickets ? " " First , they 're mad as hell when I tell them they 've been taken , that there 's no charge for coming to the beach . Then they get even madder when I tell them that , ticket or no ticket , they ca n't leave their cars in the parking lot without a parking permit . Over . " " Did any of them tell you who 's selling the tickets ? "  | " Just some guy , they say . They met him on Main Street , and he told them they could n't get on the beach without a ticket . Over . " " I want to find out who the hell is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped . Go to the phone booth in the parking lot and call headquarters and tell whoever answers that I want a man to go down to Main Street and arrest that bastard . If he comes from out of town , run him out of town . If he lives here , lock him up . " " On what charge ? Over . " " I do n't care . Think of something . Fraud . Just get him off the streets . " " Okay , Chief . " " Any other problems ? " " No . There are some more of those TV guys here with one of those mobile units , but they 're not doing anything except interviewing people . Over . " " About what ? " " Just the standard stuff . You know : Are you scared to go swimming ? What do you think about the shark ? All that crap . Over . " " How long have they been there ? " " Most of the morning . I do n't know how long they 'll hang around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Over . " " As long as they 're not causing any trouble . " " Nope . Over . " " Okay . Hey , Leonard , you do n't have to say over ' all the time . I can tell when you 're finished speaking . " " Just procedure , Chief . Keeps things clear . Over and out . " Brody waited a moment , then pushed the button again and said , " Hooper , this is Brody . Anything out there ? " There was no answer . " This is Brody calling Hooper . Can you hearp203me ? " He was about to call a third time , when he heard Hooper 's voice . " Sorry . I was out on the stern . I thought I saw something . " " What did you see ? " " Nothing . I 'm sure it was nothing . My eyes were playing tricks on me . " " What did you think you saw ? " " I ca n't really describe it . A shadow , maybe . Nothing more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have n't seen anything else ? " " Not a thing . All morning . " " Let 's keep it that way . I 'll check with you later . " " Fine . I 'll be in front of the public beach in a minute or two . " Brody put the walkie-talkie back in the bag and took out his sandwich . The bread was cold and stiff from resting against the ice-filled plastic bag that contained the cans of beer . By 2:30 , the beach was almost empty . People had gone off to play tennis , to sail , to have their hair done . The only ones left on the beach were half a dozen teen-agers and the family from Queens . Brody 's legs had begun to sunburn  --  faint red blotches were surfacing on his thighs and the tops of his feet  --  so he covered them with his towel . He took the walkie-talkie out of the bag and called Hendricks . " Anything happening , Leonard ? " " Not a thing , Chief . Over . " " Anybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's about it . Over . " " Same here . What do you hear about the ticket seller ? " " Nothing , but nobody 's giving me tickets any more , so I guess somebody ran him off . Over . "
