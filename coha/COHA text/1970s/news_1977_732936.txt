txt Letters : Application Of Travel Equations JOEL M. BERNS , D.M.D.M.K. WOODHULL XX5 pg . Letters : Application Of Travel E uations To the Editor : S=R/E is an equation of life hardly less profound than e=mc2 ( Einstein ) , and much more useful ( " Happiness Is an Equation , " by Hall T. Sprague , Travel Section , Jan. 16 ) . Apply it to a new job , a new husband or a new car  --  endless uses . And the possibilities of self-deception in regard to Satisfaction , Reality and Expectation are the grist from which life 's most interesting stories are made . Profound , Mr. Sprague , profound . JOEL M. BERNS , D.M.D. Stamford , Conn . To the Editor : Author Sprague says his magic phrase is " Give Up " ? that is , systemmatically examine your hopes and dreams about each of the places to be visited and realize ahead of time that they can not be the riveting place you imagine . My own magic phrase is " Do n't Give In , " but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in to the temptation to see everything . On an average length vacation trip you 're missing a large percentage of " the sights " anyway , so relax ! Do n't worry about what you 're missing , just eniov what you 're seeing and doing . M. K. WOODHULL Williamson , N.Y . To the Editor : We discovered the " Give Up " principle quite by chance on our first cross-country drive last August . In Colorado Springs we happened into the first motel of the trip with plain white walls , plain rugs , plain curtains , plain bedspreads and windows that could actually be opened to the delicious night air . We celebrated by staying an extra day , doing mostly nothing . I doubt the Rockies are really as beautiful as they seemed after that restorative . For another stratagem in " Upping the R " ( Reality ) , may I offer my timehonored Home Rule ? It is , do n't plan to do elsewhere what you would n't or could n't do at home . It came to me as I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in London , a strange city , that would have taken me a week in New York , a city I take pride in knowing something about . BARBARA WALKER Los Gatos , Calif . AYERS ROCK To the Editor : In regard to Alan Levy 's article , " A Rusty Monolith ... A Sacred Place " ( Travel Section , Jan. 22 ) , there is a more spectacular and less physically demanding experience than the climb the author described : walk around the Rock at midnight . While there'five years ago with a group of foreign exchange students , six of us trekked from our campsite , about a mile from the Rock , to its base , around it and back  --  a total of about eight miles between 10 P.M. and 2 A.M. The variety of shadows alone is sufficient to make one understand why the Aborigines revere the Rock as sacred . ROBERT H. RIDUN Cambridge , Mass . ' IT 'S GREEK TO mime , To the Editor : In the Letters Column ( Travel Section , Dec. 26 ) , a headline , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when a Greek did not understand something , he would say " It 's Greek to me . " Actually , the English and Americans might say that , but a Greek friend tells me that when he is left completely in the dark about something , he says , " It 's Chinese to me . " DONALD M. KIRSCHEMBAUM Brooklyn A spokesman for the Greek Tourist Office in New York replies : " The writer is correct . The Greeks have an expression that they use in this situation , It is , ' Afta einai kinezika , ' and it means , ' It 's all Chinese . ' 1 CUSTOMS To the Editor : I am writing this as a warning to the unsuspecting purchaser of items abroad . In September , my wife and I were in the Royal Copenhagen Shop in Denmark shopping for gifts to give friends on our return home . One whole wall of the first floor of the shop consisted of a display of beautiful vases , and- we admired one in particular . We debated about buying it , since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only when the salesgirl told us it was an original work of art , a unique piece , and if we bought it we would be given an affidavit ( with a copy enclosed in the box ) declaring that it was an original work of art and thus would be admitted duty-free into the United States . When the vase arrived several weeks ago , the postman requested $51.63 duty , so we refused to accept it and requested that the package be returned to Customs , since it was an original work of art and should be admitted duty-free . Surprise . Customs took another look at the vase , changed its classification and increased the duty to $66.38 , which I sadly paid . Evidently , even a reliable house , such as Royal Copenhagen , either is unaware of United States regulations , or will tell tourists anything to make a sale . SIDNEY LEVENSON Baltimore The United States Customs - replies : From a U.S. Customs Service ' point of view , sculptures and works of art must be the productions of professional artists only , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thus , an unlimited edition by a manufacturing house Would be dutiable , unless the item purchased was a piece within the stipulated first 10 . Any article of utility , such as a vase , dish , etc. , is excluded from the works-of-art provision , and duty must be paid . To the Editor : A family of travelers returding to the United States is given one Customs declaration which " the head of the family " is asked to complete . Unless United States Customs is trying to perpetuate the notion of paterfamilias , should it not ask instead that " any adult " vouch for a family 's purchases abroad ? LUCILLE G. NATKINS Great Neck , L.I . Melvyn H. Greenberg , Regional Counsel of Customs , replies : Just as beauty is said to be in the eyes of the beholder , so too may connotations of words be in the mind of the reader . There is no sexist limitation intended in the words " head of the family . " Admittedly , many families today are headed by women . Customs regulations allow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family group whether adult or minor . ( Further , as indicated on the form , the declaration may be presented individually or as a family group . RUBENS To the Editor : Because I was leaving for a visit to the Benelux countries on Jan. 4 , I was pleasantly surprised to see your feature on Rubens , " 1977 : The Rubens Year in Antwerp " ( Travel Section , Jan. 2 ) . Arriving at Antwerp , I went directly to Ruben ? House only to be informed that it was closed for the entire month of January for filming . If if were not for the thoughtfulness of a guard at the Plantin  --  Moretus Museum , I would have made a long walk to the Fine Arts museum only to find it closed , too . ( The ceiling had fallen in . ) At the Mayer Van Den Bergh Museum ( home of Brueghel the Elder 's " Mad Meg " ) , the crusty , stodgy guards made me very uncomfortable , ( I made a special note of this to the city tourist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had received such complaints . ) In all fairness , I must add that my visit to the Plantin-Moretus Museum was thoroughly rewarding . The staff was friendly and enthusiastic and it was a delight to read an interesting and excellently translated guide . EMILY A. SOPENSKY Harrisburg , Pa. - Peter A. De Maerel , director , U.S.A. , of the Belgian National Tourist Office , replies : It is a fact that the Royal Museum of Fine Arts is presently closed due to restoration work in preparation for the opening of the Rubens ' Exhibition on June 28 , and that Rubens House was closed throughout the month of January to permit filming for television . However , Our Lady Cathedral which was , and is , open to visitors contains three of Rubens 's finest masterpieces . In addition there are at least six other baroque churches in Antwerp which contain works by Rubens . A complete Program of events , giving the dates and times of the various activities scheduled in Antwerp in connection with Rubens is available from the Belgian National Tourist Office , 720 Fifth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MED To the Editor : Sitting here in my fading suntan , I read with sympathy and amusement David and Lauren Kirp 's account of their vacation at Club Med 's Playa Blanca , " Club Med : Not for Everyone " ( Travel Section , Jan. 23 ) . My husband and I returned two weeks ago from the club 's other Mexican resort , Cancan , . and although we would have to agree wtih many of the Kirps ' criticisms , we had a good time . Admittedly , the main reason we were // able to relax and enjoy our stay was our prior experience several years ago at the Martinique Club Med . We felt then that we were in a kind of summer camp , but one in which the children had taken over . Compared to the rather aloof G.O . ' s at Martinique , the staff members at Cancun were usually friendly and pleasant . They publicized special events and tried to cajole the G.M. 's into participating , but neither of us felt under any great pressure to join in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long , crescent-shaped expanse of powdery-white sand and marvelously clear blue water . At your own option , you could be with the crowd , or you could walk farther along the beach for more solitude or less clothing . We were not disturbed by public address announcements . Dinnertime was moderately noisy and grew much more so with the arrival in midweek of a group which took delight in shouting out the Club Med toast after each swallow . There is an alternative to the dining room din , and that is the smaller , more intimate Cafe du Port , a restaurant which seats about 80 people by advance reservation only , and where it is possible to converse with one 's tablemates . We managed to have two dinners at the cafe , but could only accomplish this by standing in line before 10 A.M. to make the reservation . The Cancun club turned out to be the kind of place where you can really do pretty much as you please . We chose to avoid most of the frenetic group activities and enjoy the sun , sand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To the Editor : David and Lauren Kirp suggest that perhaps other Club Meds are different . At the Martinique Club I found the same cultural isolation , crudeness of style , regimentation , the same scene of sexual promiscuity . There were also disappointments resulting from rigid economy by management . For instance , not only were the meals unmemorable , but there were ' no alternative dishes for any dinner Since there are no single rooms at the Club , the unattached guest must be prepared to share accommodations with another person of the same sex . RUTH E. MESSINGER New York To the Editor : I spent a week at the Fort Royal Club Med on Guadeloupe last April and had a super holiday . I frequently have told friends that the club is camp for adults but I viewed this statement as a positive description reflecting the relaxed hassle-free vacation I had . In contrast to the Kirps , I never felt pushed to participate in the numerous scheduled activities . Instead , I spent my time to my liking and enjoyed having the numerous options available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I made some lasting friendships . I might add that I 'm single and did n't feel pressured to prove myself as Don Juan , although I did meet such individuals . I wo n't pretend all was " wonderland , " but over-all , I found Club Med , at least for me as a tennis and watersports enthusiast , a terrific place to unwind and forget the daily push , stress and strain of our American way of life . JERALD L. REISMANN , M.D. Rochester To the Editor : It 's about time someone gave an ac ? curate and truthful description of Clut Med . To this day , when I hear the theme song , I start salivating , thinking it is time for lunch . I guess it works under the same concept as Pavlov 's dog  --  the conditioned-stimulus response . The Kirps failed to mention that allday picnic is referred to as the " nude picnic . " At least in Martinique it was , the object of the day being to get so drunk from the relay races that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend . For many of the young men and women it was the first time they ever set eyes on the human anatomy of the opposite sex . So I guess in some respects , you could call it an educational picnic . For $600 , I have been on vacations where I have not been abused mentally , physically or emotionally . FRAN S. GOTTLIEB New York To the Editor : One of the problems Americans have with Club Med is the custom of rotating the village chief and staff to new locations every new season . Americans who return to a favorite vacation resort are used to seeing the same staff when they return . This has added importance at Club Med , due to the unique and informal relationship between G.M. 's and G.O . ' s . Many Americans forget or are unaware of the fact that although it is " new " to many of us , the Club has been in existence for 27 years , during which time it has developed its traditions , customs and " philosophy . " A // ' The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I now know what it is like to be a sardine for over 20 hours , and to experience swelled ankles , dirty bodies , odoriforous clothing and no breakfast . : But all this did n't put a damper on our stay in Hong Kong . We loved every minute of it . The plane trip did have an effect on our deciding to leave the tour in Hong Kong and continue on to Hawaii for a rest . As we were arriving at Kai Tak Airport to meet our Pan Am Clipper Westwind , I saw the TIA plane with all 376 ( minus two ) passengers taxiing down the runway for the trip back to New York . While sipping a martini in the upstairs lounge of our plane 1 reflected on our earlier journey : " Wonder what Barb. and the gang in row 47 are doing now ? " ? as I rubbed my normal-sized ankles and mopped my cool brow with a hot towel presented h. the affable stewardess . CLIFF SMITH Morris Plains , N.J. To the Editor : Fred Ferretti in his description @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Japanese " aircraft carriers among the ships that he observed from his window . In this he is mistaken . No doubt he did see aircraft carriers , as naval vessels are a familiar sight in ' the port of Hong Kong . They periodi- , cally drop anchor in the harbor to allow their crews shore leave . But the ' present-day Japanese Maritime SelfDefense Force ( Japan 's Navy ) has n't any vessel larger than a destroyer . PAUL CiaLLER Queens
