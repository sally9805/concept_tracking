The Piccadilly bus covers the same path down to the bank of the wide Missouri marked by the hoofprints of the horses ridden by General George Armstrong Custer and Jesse James . nother kind of international flavor is lent Kansas City by its Country Club Plaza , a Spanish-styled marketplace and the oldest suburban shopping center in the United States .

There are over 150 stores , and over a dozen and a half restaurants . In addition to this planned retail center , the Plaza is rimmed by a residential area of private homes , high rises , multiple unit dwellings , town houses and condominiums . The Plaza has its own hotels . The new Alameda Park , quite naturally , sports a large waterfall at its entrance and a plethora of fine statuary . There are no overhead power lines to be seen at Country Club Plaza . Nor huge wastelands of parked cars  --  there are eight gigantic multilevel enclosed free parking areas .

He revolutionized the planning of residential districts and planning centers , and without a doubt his Country Club Plaza is famed for its beauty throughout the world . One Kansas Citian , a top executive , tells me that every Saturday morning he and his wife simply take off for the day to the Plaza , to dine , shop , take in a show , but mostly to enjoy the parklike and elegant atmosphere .

The Light is the same size in every detail as the original in Seville , Spain . The marble shaft is six feet square at the base and the light with its cast-bronze chandelier stands thirty-eight feet high , with a reflection pool twenty feet across . The world-famous Giralda Tower of Seville was the inspiration for this tallest of the ten towers on the Plaza  --  it is about one-third the size of the 130-foot-high tower of the original in Seville , but it is as exquisitely fashioned as the original , one of the proud architectural monuments in Spain . Ilus Davis , the quietly impressive ex-mayor of Kansas City who is credited with contributing so much to its present growth and vitality , smiles at the remembrance of a visit by a group of Seville residents , including its mayor , to check out whether a gauche American city on the prairie could rightfully lay claim to being a " sister city " to a classical European community largely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I followed the cavalcade of our Spanish guests down to the Plaza in my own car , just to make sure that everything worked out happily , " he told me . " I expected it would , but then ... When I arrived , they were all standing there and looking up at the Giralda Tower  --  their Giralda Tower . The mayor of Seville could not say a word : he just stood there , so deeply touched that he was in tears . We were sister cities , starting then . " But trees and paving blocks do not make a cosmopolis , I weakly reminded myself . Still , I stopped even that type of feeble remonstrance at the Kansas City spell that evening at dinner . I found myself at a table for six ; our host was Mayor William J.

The conversation was -- -to put it simply  --  astonishing . Mayor Wheeler , who has been described by a somewhat dis-loyal constituent as a " middle-aged , slightly fubsy 155-pound-er with a voice like stewed alfalfa , " is a doctor of forensic medicine , a pathologist who once served as county coroner on his way to city hall ( he wrote a highly divert-ing book about it  --  Doctor in Politics ) , lawyer , and a shrewd and accomplished politician ( he has just been reelected ) who apparently takes considerable delight in throwing opponents off guard with his collection of over 200 slightly mad hats , and his penchant for riding elephants and donkeys in public .

Marion and Henry W. Bloch are agog over another event of international cachet connected with Kansas City . That is the exhibit of one of the largest international @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 385 individual pieces , each an ancient treasure , of " The Exhibition of Archaeological Finds of the People 's Republic of China . " these Kansas Citians are proud that the exhibit came directly to their own Nelson Gallery and Atkins Muesum after an initial showing in Washington , D.C. The Chinese did not select Kansas City by any accident  --  they are well aware of the superb collection of Oriental art which is permanently exhibited at Nelson-Atkins , and Kansas City struck them as the ideally structured place , culturally speaking , for a stopover in America 's heartland . As you may guess , the conversation at our table was hardly confined to cowtown chitchat . My own small contribution managed to strike the proper cosmopolitan key . I had met a young chap on the Chamber of Commerce who was to be in contact with the Chinese archaeologists ; by pure coincidence he had majored in Mandarin Chinese in college . Can you imagine the effect of that upon the Chinese ? Mandarin they might well expect in Washington . But in Kansas City ! Cosmopolis on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cosmopolitan sentimentalities , if you will excuse me , are still part of the charm and surprise which Kansas City springs upon the visitor who has never been there before , or the guile it exerts upon others to return again and again . But there are hard-nosed facts which support the sentiment with a clout which is equally astonishing . Take wheat , alone . The two most powerful words in the world today are not guns and money , but wheat and oil . And wheat may be the stronger . William F. Buckley recognized that when he had as his guest on his TV program , " Firing Line , " a well-known Kansas Citian , Morton I. Sosland , editor and publisher of Milling and Baking News , and also publisher of Retail Baking Today , at about the same time that The Wall Street Journal was also running a front-page Continued on page 66 // a season but you have to love what is in their hearts . That 's a good reflection . People are entitled to that kind of emotion . I want our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us on the field . I want them to get involved in the game . I hope we can present that type of attitude here in Kansas City . I can think back now on my decision to take this job . There was a time I almost did n't accept the opportunity to be the head coach here . There were a lot of reasons then . There were a lot of things with California and with the 49ers that were very meaningful to me and to my family . I was happy living in the Bay Area and coaching with the 49ers . Now , though , I can think how ridiculous it was that I hesitated even a little . It all came down to the people who believed in me  --  people like Paul Brown and Dick Nolan . Their belief in me as a human being on a man-to-man basis was important . I knew I could n't face them if I did n't take the job . It was a class job with an outstanding organization , one that has a tremendous reputation in pro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laugh about the uneasiness in that decision . Being head coach is a whole new world for me . There are a lot of things you take for granted . There are times , even after you take the job , when things build up . They are little , but a hundred little things , small decisions and final decisions . There is frustration and there are times you say , " Why did I do this ? " I gave away a little security . We all do that in life . But you have to accept the challenge , and I think I 'm the type of person who does , or I would n't be here . Kansas City grows on you . This organization has done everything it promised to do and that makes it more comfortable . Within the confines of fairness I 've gotten all my promises . And I like Kansas City . 1 like the people . I like the schools and I like the environment for my family . We have good friends here . There is a warmth here that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start of my first head coaching season , there is an exciting , growing anticipation for the real season , the battle to start . When this is printed , it will have already begun . That 's the scary part . It 's plan B. Plan A is all the preliminary planning . Plan B is the arena with all the people . Let 's face it . It all comes right down to what happens down there on the field . This is the focal point of everything and I can hardly wait . I 've thought a lot about how I 'm going to react to Plan B. I 'm the emotional type . I 've thought about how I 'm going to be on the sideline with the players and in the arena . I 've thought that ! ca n't be emotional to the point that I act like a knothead out there . But that 's the challenge of the whole thing . So here I am . I just know it 's going to be fun . 71 has taken me to the high-style @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ City Trade Zone , and his enthusiasm is put to a severe test by some first-rate rock music , and also by some of the most attractive women and some of the most uninhibited dance stepping this side of Acapulco . He wins out , eventually , over the din and the whirling , both quite narcotic , but really no match in the long run for what he is saying . Foreign trade zones are not to be confused with so-called " free ports " where miscellaneous consumer products can be purchased at airports , for example , free of local customs and excise taxes . But it 's got the same magic about it . Miller explains that a foreign trade zone can be warehouses , manufacturing or assembly plants , and exhibition areas that have the advantage of being technically outside the U.S. customs territory . The Kansas City zone , he says , has a total of 3.5 million square feet  --  more than all the other U.S. zones combined . The Kansas City zone is made up of 2,815,000 square feet of unique underground storage belonging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ underground space owned by the Inland Storage and Distribution Center in Kansas City , Kansas , and 250,000 square feet in the Radial Warehouse owned by Beiger Cartage and Service , Inc . An additional 74,000square-foot site has been added at Gateway Plaza near Kansas City International . In zones such as Kansas City 's , foreign goods or parts can be imported duty-free to be mixed with domestic parts in a new product or indefinitely stored or exhibited . Duty is not paid if the product is exported outside the United States , or until it leaves the zone for an American market , Miller added . If the imported part is used to make an American product , the importer has the option of paying tariffs on the finished product or the raw materials  --  whichever is lower . In addition , the importer pays on only the actual raw materials that are used  --  not scraps that may be discarded as in the case of leather goods . The zone , he pointed out , can be used for the assembly of Japanese motorcycles or bikes , German @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Scotch whiskey or French wines . The possibilities , he said , are almost endless . A major benefit to foreign businessmen , Miller continued , is in saving money through delayed cash flow  --  and also in " playing " the U.S. tariff regulations by picking the lowest tariff possible . While products are stored , exhibited , or assembled , the dollars that would be tied up in tariffs can be put to work by the foreign business . In addition , foreign trade zones can lead foreign business to new , untapped markets and foreign investment . And that 's what U.S. cities such as Kansas City are after , he notes . Marshall Miller continues : " A foreign bicycle manufacturer can ship component parts into the Kansas City trade zone without paying any duty . He can assemble them into complete bicycles with American labor . When he ships them out of Kansas City to other parts of the U.S. , he pays only the 5.5 percent duty . " If he ships them abroad , he pays no duty at all . Marshall Miller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to 49 percent foreign components at substantial savings into the Kansas City zone without paying any tariff duty . The finished products can be assembled in the trade zone with American labor , and then legally shipped anywhere in the United States without paying duty so long as the foreign cost component is 49 percent or less . Everybody wins . So you can see these Kansas Citians are smart cookies . Kansas City is plumb full of spokesmen . Students who went away to Ivy League schools and came back because they wanted to work and live here . Young career women who find it exciting to mingle with the city 's leaders . Cab drivers like the youngish-oldish one I had from the airport who boasted of a hack career of over fifty years . The high points came when he was Harry Truman 's special favorite driver from the charming white home in Independence , built by Mrs. Truman 's grandfather in the 1860 's , over the short haul down to the political canyons of the city . " A real gentleman . Always friendly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Smart . Touchy as all get out . Washington never changed him . When he got back here , he was the same Harry I always knew . " The Man Who Always Drove Harry says that he left Kansas City many times , but he always came back to stay , and this time it 's for good . Perhaps Kansas City 's best spokesman , though , is a man of implacable Midwest optimism , originally from Boston , with degrees from Northeastern and Harvard . He has taught at the graduate school of New York University , but these academic laurels are balanced by career posts as Technical Director of the Research Laboratories Division , Ben dix Corporation , and a long list of appointments to government commissions and advisory councils . His name is Charles Newton Kimball and the present record awards him seniority in executive management of the nation 's applied research establishment  --  he has been president of the famed Midwest Research Institute in Kansas City since 1950 . As described by a friend in the community : " He has challenged , loved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America in myriad ways . . Much of his effort has been devoted to discussing ways in which the attractive features of Midwest Living can be enhanced through judicious coupling of technology . " The Midwest Research Institute states , " The resources of MRI are available under contract to industry , government agencies , trade associations , foundations and others interested in problem solutions which scientific research can achieve .. . Since its founding in 1944 , MR1 has completed some 6,000 undertakings in science and technology and economics for 1,600 public and private clients . These efforts in the application of scientific studies and research to the discovery of new products and processes , to the improvement of existing products and processes , and to the formulation of scientific marketing principles for companies in the Central States have not only stimulated the economy of this area , but have helped resolve regional and national problems as well , in pollution , health and safety , materials improvement , leisure/recreation , education and crime . " It is clear that MRI is one of the jewels in the crown of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to quote its president at some length . Dr. Kimball has the best understanding of urban problems I have ever encountered , and he is most articulate in discussing them . As we shall see later , he also is an urban activist . But at this point , he is explaining a bit to me personally ; in a certain sense also musing aloud to himself . " The time has come for a new set of alternatives quite different from the dark caverns of New York and the bland row housing of the sunny Southland . In Kansas City , the people and the leadership are serving notice to this nation that we intend to offer an attractive new option for urban dwellers , an attractive new quality of life within the metropolitan center . We feel this option is so favorable that it may very well serve as a progressive model to other perceptive cities throughout the balance of this century . " We are beginning to concentrate on our unique situation and we have turned our back on former idols . We are not New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boston . We are not Seattle . We are Kansas City and we have isolated our specific problems and opportunities and have planned and designed for them . " Working together in metropolitan Kansas City means bi-state compacts and agreements among two state legislatures  --  Kansas and Missouri  --  six counties , two major cities and some thirty other self-determining subdivisions . The land surrounding the Kansas City International Airport for 100 square miles , encompassing a multitude of communities , counties and the two states , is zoned according to a master plan . " In planning we realized that Kansas City did not have a bad image , nor a good one . It had virtually no image and was widely ignored by national decision makers , because it never came to mind . We had so much to holler about , yet nobody would listen . We were not underdeveloped , but underutilized and underrecogn ized . " At a conversational point like this , Dr. Kimball pauses reflectively as if to gather his thoughts . The truth of the matter is that he is actually testing his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a signal for him to press forward even more eloquently . My job is to learn more about Kansas City , and he knows more . So I raise my eyebrows encouragingly . He grabs the signal and launches into a factual breakdown of what Kansas City is doing about things today , brushing aside the philosophy and rushing into the statistics like a sure swimmer diving into the surf , plunging into the biggest wave just before it breaks : " Time after time Eastern and Western industrialists have come here and seen our city and asked , ' Where are the plains ; where is the wheat piled in the streets ; where is the dust bowl ; where are the Cowboys and Indians ? ' Instead they are surprised to see Crown Center , KCI , the Truman Sports Arena , the Country Club Plaza , the Nelson Gallery , the Johnson County residences , fountains , wooded hills , Westport , River Quay , and all the rest that characterizes our Kansas City renaissance . " Our ' Prime Time ' representatives  --  a coalition of county @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made a very firm commitment here to ward a controlled growth , a manageable growth . We will not hustle and bustle pell-mell in all directions to achieve growth for growth 's sake . Our rate of in-migration is slower than that of Dallas , Houston , and Atlanta , and we like it that way . Bigness for its own sake is increasingly evil , and can only lead to the huddled inhumanity found too often in too many of our present cities .. .. " One of our most interesting construction projects deserves discussion . It is Crown Center , a 100-acre , fifty-building downtown suburb being developed with private capital by Hallmark Cards , Incorporated . It will cost more than $250 million , perhaps as much as $400 million . It will have a daytime population of more than 50,000 persons and a permanent population of 10,000 residents . " It is offices and apartments and condominiums and a hotel and retail and parks and things to see and do . Yet it also affords a man a chance to slip away by himself into a park @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out because it is America 's best example of an inducement to redistribute the population within a city . Crown Center offers an attractive option to those who might move to the suburbs . It is returning leadership to the central core to live , not just to work . It offers a stimulating residential climate to the intelligentsia , to the cultural leadership  --  to young and old alike . In the word of Joyce Hall , founder of Hallmark , it is designed to be an address people can be proud of  --  and given such an address they will live there , whether in the city or on its edge . " But our revitalization has been much more than brick and mortar . " To correct past misconceptions we have emphasized our thirty-third consecutive year of progressive reform government . " Although people remember the era of KC jazz and speakeasies and Pendergast , we have one of the finest police forces in America and recently gave our chief of police , Clarence Kelley , to replace J.

" Although we 're not considered culturally conscious , our Nelson Gallery is among the top ten in the United States and one of the top three in the excellence of its Oriental collection . " Even New York fashion editors have discovered us and compare our magnificent Country Club Plaza area to what New York 's Fifth Avenue used to be . ' " Early this year , the Midwest Research Institute published its finding on the Quality of Life in the United States . As we have seen , it is the quality of the human existence and human experience that appeals so strongly to the fast growing service industries . Not density , not income , not Broadway theater no one can afford , not historic decay and congestion , but those uplifting factors that make up the nation 's overall health and its citizens ' well-being . " Dr. Kimball had very simply put his finger , or voice , on the cogent characteristic I had come upon in Kansas City and was struggling to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Oriental collection at the museum where I amused myself by utilizing transcendental meditation to make an ancient many-armed Indian figure with an elephant 's head dance a slow Himalayan gavotte for my eyes alone . I had felt it by standing on the five-yard line in the center of the huge empty stadium Lamar Hunt built for his Kansas City Chiefs , and having the wits frightened out of me as 1 imagined myself running back a kickoff , a member of the suicide squad hunted by eleven 285-pound killers hurtling down the field at me . I had sensed it in driving slowly through Mission Hills , surely one of the most beautiful residential sections to be found anywhere in America . There is room for whimsy in Mission Hills , too , in spite of its grandeur . State Line Road runs north and south there , with Missouri on the left going down , and Kansas on the right . Most of Mission Hills is in Kansas , although possibly 99 percent of its inhabitants make their living in Kansas City , Missouri . They play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ club set there in the center of Mission Hills , but just across the road from the 18th hole , across State Line Road , let me emphasize , is the clubhouse , The Carriage Club , set with infinite wisdom and resourcefulness by the founding fathers of the club on the Missouri side of the road , where a tired and thirsty golfer , wearied from his game in officially " dry " Kansas , can properly refresh himself with the right drinks in " wet " Missouri . Other things make a city , too  --  history , and fun , and people . The first settler was Francois Chouteau , who found the landing under the big bluffs to his liking fora trading post in 1821 , and settled where the city now starts at the Missouri 's edge . In 1835 , Kan times : The imposing former residence of Boss Tom Pendergast ( Kansas City was known as " Tom 's Town " from 1928 to 1939 ) is now the home of a man of quite another stamp , the distinguished Dr. E. Grey Dimond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the University of Missouri  --  Kansas City , and also ( cosmopolis , again ! ) Consultant to the China Medical Association , People 's Republic of China . " What is the city but the people ? " said Shakespeare , and Kansas City touches the rest of the nation with its ambiance . Walt Disney , Thomas Hart Benton , Goodman Ace , Burt Bacharach , Ed Asner , Charles Luckman , Ginger Rogers , Lee Tracy , Jean Harlow , Joan Crawford , Walter Cronkite , Craig Stevens , 5F and Sally Rand are all Kansas Citians who influenced American national mores . Others closely associated with Kansas City by virtue of going to school there or simply working for a spell are Gladys Swarthout , William Powell , Virgil Thomson , Casey Stengel , and Ernest Hemingway . And , of course , the names of those associated with Kansas City jazz are never to be forgotten when the blues rise of a smoky evening ...

Fun ? Kansas City is a great sports town , and with its big-league contenders on all fronts  --  the football Chiefs , the baseball Royals , the basketball Kings and the hockey Scouts  --  it competes loud and clear for national headlines . Howard Turtle , the editor of the Kansas City Star 's Sunday magazine section , a star in its own right , gives a lot of credit to Lamar Hunt in building up Kansas Citians ' feeling of togetherness with his Texas-style concepts of stadia and will to win . Kansas City people took their Super Bowl win seriously : and now they 're on the comeback trail , as you may read elsewhere in this issue . Then there 's the American Royal Livestock and Horse Show , a showcase of America 's purebred animals  --  cattle , swine , sheep , and horses  --  now in its seventy-seventh year , which brings in 2,500 livestock entries and 1,500 horses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 200,000 people to look on at the nine-day show . Some of that flesh is eatin ' stuff . So , risking my life , I mentioned that Easterners are of the general opinion that Kansas City , like Chicago , knows where the best steaks are  --  and for that reason ships ' em on to New York City , leaving for hometown consumption only thick and imposing cuts which turn out to be a serious challenge to the molars , except that you 're supposed to be tough enough yourself not to notice this : size and fighting qualities are esteemed above prime tenderness . I had already conceded that Kansas City roast beef was the best in the land . The simplest roast beef lunch sandwich all over Kansas City contains a cut which would have headwaiters swooning and prices going up like a balloon in any other place . But now , a bristling Kansas Citian accepted my challenge on the steak . He took me to The Hereford House , where I practically outraged a buxom waitress by ordering a filet , the choice of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restaurant . Once more , I capitulate . I have never tasted a better steak . I didnot order it large , but for a filet , it was large , tender , and handsome , and simply not to be outdone by any , wherever a long career in steak hunting has ever taken me . Kansas City has other attractions to offer in food . Jasper 's , with Continental cuisine , has won the Holiday Award every year since 1971 . Calvin Trillin , the whimsical food specialist , has already written that " the best restaurants of the world are , of course , in Kansas City . Not all of them : only the top four or five . . . the single best restaurant in the world is Arthur Bryant 's Barbeque . " Now , since even James Beard had admitted that he considered the two top restaurants in Kansas City to be The American at the top of the Crown Center Hotel and Bryant 's , I determined to test that latter one out . Well , it has plenty of color , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obviously millions of ballplayers and newspapermen have feasted , all of whom have left their knicks on the table and splashes of gravy on the walls , each so dearly cherished by the owners as to be held in perpetuity .

He ate a gargantuan portion of barbecued beet ' , swimming in sauce , which would have thrown Babe Ruth and Hank Aaron put together . Then , sighing at the prospect of leaving Bryant 's , possibly forever , for work in other climes , he ordered a second lunch all over again , which he polished off like a famished Kodiak bear . I guess Bryant 's is really OK . I could n't eat at every restaurant in Kansas City in a short stay , but I also enjoyed very much the old-time grandeur and ancient courtesy of the waiters at the fine old Savoy , a proud relic of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hushed obeisance to the niceties of dining . The minute you step off the plane at Kansas City 's magnificent new international airport , unrivaled in the nation for its huge capacity and a design which still brings you to a hop , skip and jump from plane to luggage and transportation , instead of the long agonizing treks so many airports demand , you know that Kansas City is different . For one thing , the airport flooring is wood parquet , all 12,105,425 pieces of it ! A living room at your doorstep . Good vibes down there in Gully Town . A Kansas City bookie , who should know something about the quality of life to be found in the future , says the last word out of the corner of his mouth : " Good odds that Kansas City 'll be doing all right . That 's all I got ta say . " rs
