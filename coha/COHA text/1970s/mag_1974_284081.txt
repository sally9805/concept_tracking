When the Philadelphia Inquirer ran a story stating that a man had died from drinking too much carrot juice , C.T . Budny of Woodbury , N.J. , was incensed . " I have been drinking one , two or three , or even as much as four quarts of carrot juice at times daily , " he wrote to the National News Council , " and have never had any but beneficial health . " <P> Budny 's complaint was one of 200 received by the 15-member council since it set up shop last August as an independent watchdog of press fairness . The complaint was also one of the 34 cases to get past a staff screening and reach the seven members of the council 's grievance committee . After sage deliberation , the committee deferred judgment " pending further study . " <P> Established and partially supported by the Twentieth Century Fund , a smallish New York-based foundation , the council has spent much of its first nine months dealing with trivialities . It is not a record that pleases its members , an eclectic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the law , civil rights and other fields. * Executive Director William Arthur , a former editor of Look , blames the council 's slow beginnings on public ignorance of its existence and on the naivet of early complaints . " Too many of them had to do with editorial opinion rather than accuracy , " he says . " Bias is not something we handle . " Associate Director Ned Schnurman concedes that only " about seven " of the council 's 34 cases thus far have been " significant . " But he adds : " Now we are getting the kind of cases that will make the council worthwhile . " <P> Indeed , the council has several weighty allegations of press unfairness on its docket . Among them : charges by Graham Martin , U.S. Ambassador to Saigon , that New York Times Reporter David Shipler had inserted " numerous inaccuracies and half-truths " in a story about U.S. assistance to Saigon ( TIME , March 25 ) ; a complaint by a New York lawyer that public television 's Black Journal had been one-sided in supporting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Yet doubts about the council 's effectiveness remain . Last week , for example , it deftly sidestepped a host of complaints registered by the Mobil Oil Corp . against a March 20 ABC television News Closeup special on " Oil : The Policy Crisis . " The ABC program indicted Government oil policies , blaming them and the major oil companies for leading the nation into last winter 's energy crisis . Offended by ABC 's interpretation , Mobil listed 32 " particularly inaccurate or unfair " statements in the broadcast . Astonishingly , the council 's decision , written by National Review Publisher William Rusher , concluded that it would not be worthwhile to " comment on the issue of the precise accuracy or fairness of the individual statements " in the program . Instead the council said that " ABC kept well within the bounds of robust opinion journalism in its selection and presentation of material . "
