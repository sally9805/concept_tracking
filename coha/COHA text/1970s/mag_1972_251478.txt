A New York City ferryboat became a Mississippi stern-wheeler for a day - tootling its way up the Hudson River to the infectious quicksteps of three Dixieland jazz bands . A ballroom at the Commodore Hotel seemed to go through a time warp to the 1930s , as kids in jeans and matrons in long gowns bobbed , swayed and shuffled to the strains of Count Basic and Sy Oliver . <P> Giving the cleaning ladies the night off , Radio City Music Hall opened its doors at midnight for a four-hour jam session that saw Ben Webster , Zoot Sims , and Milt Jackson tapping toes where the Rockettes usually toe-up to tap . Uptown at Yankee Stadium , the likes of Ray Charles , Dave Brubeck and Gerry Mulligan made a far more winning team than the stadium 's usual inhabitants . <P> So it went last week as jazz came home to the city that reared it , made it rich , sucked it dry , threw it aside - and now , in a stroke of historical irony , seems to have given it one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 62 all-stars and more than 500 sidemen-from Duke Ellington to Charlie Byrd , from Dizzy Gillespie to Roberta Flack , from Eddie Condon to Sonny Rollins-wailed through 30 concerts in eleven various settings ( range : 300 seats to 32,000 ) . When it was all over , more than 100,000 jazz buffs had paid a total of $500,000 to listen to a music that more than a foolish few had considered dead years ago , gone with Kid Ory , Bunny Berigan and Charlie Parker . Some , indeed , settled in for the duration , paying $122 for a ticket to all 30 events . <P> The event was called the Newport Jazz Festival New York . It was a massive transplant of the same Newport Festival that rotund former Jazz Pianist George Wein , 46 , had run for 18 years in a large field hard by Rhode Island 's Narragansett Bay . In recent years , with rock festivals failing on all sides , Newport had become a new chosen land of the Huns of Aquarius . Last year , when a noisy and violent horde broke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dionne Warwicke was singing , Wein had enough ; he canceled the show . A few days later , the Newport city fathers canceled the festival permanently . " I cried for a while , " recalls Wein . " But there was nothing I could do . " <P> Actually , as Wein soon realized , what he could do was to move down the coast a bit and make New York the Bayreuth of jazz . In Rhode Island , he says , " they were never interested in the artistic content of the festival , only how much money it would bring in . What we found out when we moved to New York was that the world was listening , if Rhode Island was n't . " <P> <P> What the world was listening to reflected Wein 's own solid , mainstream musical tastes . The emphasis was on established and often middle-aged jazz figures , so much so that Trumpeter Miles Davis absented himself from the week 's proceedings , complaining of " comfortable " and " Uncle Tom " aspects in Wein 's programming-and about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerts in one day but was only going to get one fee ( $7,500 ) , like everyone else .
