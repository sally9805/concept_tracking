President Nixon has long been worried that the U.S. is losing out in world markets because domestic labor costs are inflating so fast and kicking prices up so high . With that in mind , he stretched his usual hands-off approach to private pricing matters just a bit last week and called into the White House leaders of the two sides in the current steel-labor negotiations . He gave them both an innocuous pep talk , urging them to make a settlement that would allow the steel industry to remain at least somewhat competitive in the world . Budget Chief George Shultz assured newsmen that the President " was n't trying to tell them what to settle for . " The Administration is resigned to a steel deal that will push up labor costs by at least 10% a year-and give workers in other industries another inflationary target to aim for . <P> Several key indicators show just how badly these inflationary settlements are hurting the U.S. Items : &gt; Steel imports in May hit1,800,000 tons-an amount equal to 16% of the nation 's overall steel market . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only in August 1968 , when customers were also hedging against a strike . &gt; Sales of imported cars in June surged to a historic high of 149,000 , capturing 16.1% of the U.S. market , or well over one-quarter more than a year ago . In the year 's first six months , sales of Volkswagens dipped slightly to 289,000 , but that decline was more than made up by the incredible rise of Japanese cars . Toyotas rode up 57% , to 140,000 cars sold , and Datsuns jumped 136% , to 99,000 . Japanese cars are selling fast because of high quality and low price , and their manufacturers benefit notably from the relatively moderate cost of Japanese steel ( automaking steel sells for an average of $156 a ton in Japan v. $200 a ton in the U.S. ) . &gt; The Commerce Department predicted that the nation 's merchandise trade surplus will fall from $2.7 billion last year to about $500 million this year , the lowest since 1937 . Reason : imports are rising much faster than exports . &gt; Partly because the demands of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more American markets , domestic manufacturers operated their plants at only 73.1% of capacity during the first quarter , an inefficient level that was the lowest since the late 1950s . It is likely that the nation 's factories also ran at a slow pace in the second quarter . One indicator : American steel production has fallen nearly 17% in the two months since early May .
