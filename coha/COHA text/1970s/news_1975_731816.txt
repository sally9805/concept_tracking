txt Back in 1967 , when Roy Lee Hunter became the first black youth to integrate the schools in this little town , he got into frequent fights with his classmates in which he claims he was often " double-teamed " ( simultaneously attacked by two others ) . The trouble did n't atop after school . In one instance , a dead black bear was deposited on the porch of the hovel that the Hunter family called home , conveying an unmistakable message as to the state of Roy Lee 's welcome at the hitherto-all-white school . When Roy Lee Hunter later became Unadilla High 's first black graduate , the flag at school was seen flying at half-staff . At the ceremony in the school auditorium , an empty chair separated Roy Lee , the lone black youth in his class , from his cappedand-gowned white classmates . This school year , another youngster from the Hunter family , Roy Lee 's 16-year-old sister , Faye , is enrolled at Unadilla High School . There have been some marked changes in this town of 1,400 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no problems getting along with her white classmates . What 's more , she , along with a white girl , is co-homecoming queen of her class . Getting Together " We 've gotten together on most everything , " Faye says , chatting on the dusty , unpaved street that runs in front of her family 's unpainted frame house . She casually adds that of the girls whom she considers her best friends at school , " two of them are black and three are white . " ( Today , Unadilla High has about 200 black students , outnumbering the 100 whites . ) The difference between Faye 's experience at Unadilla High and that of her brother is all the more striking when the short time span between their experiences is considered : It is also a not-atypical situation here in the South , where school integration , long feared and fought against by so many , now is a working reality . How well it 's working is another question , and it depends mainly on whom you talk with . For iinstance on the matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selection of co-queens  --  one white and one black  --  has stripped " the honor of its relevancy . " More important , some of the more affluent whites in Unadilla have pulled their children out of public schools . And some will tell you that forced integration has " ruined the school system . " Differing Recollections There is as much difference in viewpoint about the recent past as about the present . Consider Roy Lee Hunter 's days at Unadilla High , which he remembers as difficult , even dangerous . Harry Hamrick , a school board member then and now , has a different recollection . During a discussion at his generalmerchandise store , Mr. Hamrick says that Roy Lee " was treated better than the other kids " ? read " white kids " ? " because we were trying to make it work . " But what about the flag flying at halfstaff ? " We had a couple of kids who put the flag up , " Mr. Hamrick says , " and sometimes they got it right and sometimes they did n't . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? A woman visitor at Mr. Hamrick 's store remembers the scene but contends that it did n't reflect discrimination . " One of the students was absent , " she says . But if there is disagreement on both the present and the recent past , there is consensus on one point : The changes from the late 1960s are marked , both here and throughout the South . And it is also true that in the past several years , the South has n't generally suffered from the violence that has marked such Northern cities as Boston during school integration . Regardless of the success  --  or lack of ft  --  that has accompanied integration in Unadilla , a look at what has happened and what is happening here offers an interesting study of how school desegregation is progressing in the South . The common denominator behind the changes here and throughout the South has been legal pressure on important people . Here in Dooly County , for example , the federal governlnent had sued and had employed what it then thought was a potent weapon ? cutting off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make up the difference and kept running largely segregated schools . Then , in 1969 , the U.S. government filed a suit that took in most of the state 's school districts and threatened top state officials with contempt if they did n't see that integration orders were carried out . In 1970 , everyone Was scrambling to integrate . Change of Attitude Of course , integration did n't mean the immediate end of unrest in the schools . But as time went by and local power structures saw that integration was a fact , there began to be a change of attitude among local officials . If integration was here to stay , the line of reasoning seemed to go , then it might as well work as effectively as possible . In Unadilla , making integration work within the school was accomplished  --  after two years of trouble  --  by hiring a tough , physically imposing principal with ercRerience in the integration struggle in Georgia 's Sumter County , one of the toughest struggles in the South . The new man in charge , Robert Ashley , brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arm 's reach of his desk ; it has been used frequently . Mr. Ashley says he did n't look at his new job as a racial challenge at all , just as a discipline problem . " When I started to come over here , " he recalls . " they maid , ' 130Y , you do n't want to go over there  --  that 's a hell hole . ' But it was n't so much a racial thing , just a bunch of wild kids , and I tamed them down . I used the board an a lot of them , ran a few of them away , and that settled the rest down . " ( In Georgia , there is no state law banning corporal puiddiment . ) " The three years I 've been here , we have n't had the first racial incident of any importance , " Mr. Ashley says , and students agree . Boy Lee 's sister , Faye , says , " Sometimes we call them whitey or hockey , and they may call us nigger , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But how much real progress has been made in easing race relations at Unadilla High is open to question . Selection of homecoming queens is an example . The fact that the honor is shared by a black girl and a white girl is n't because there was a tie or because one ranked first and one second in student votes ; rather , the black girl getting the most votes among black candidates and the white girl getting the most votes among whites are chosen as co-queens , regardless of their ranking in the overall voting . " We do n't call it racial  --  we call it co-coronations , " the principal says . " It 's pure democracy , the way I see it . " But a veteran woman civil-rights workers does n't see it that way at all . " What they 've done is completely strip the honor of its relevancy , " she says . Cosmetic Progress ? Relevant or not , the blacks do have representation in the life of the school . ( Studentcouncil elections work in a fashion similar to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than meaningful progress , it is a far cry from only a few years ago . So , too , is the integration of the school 's athletic teams . Currently , the star of Unadilla High 's " Blue Devils " football team is black , and Mr. Asbisy feels that this fact has been a considerable boost in the overall acceptance of integration at the school . Indeed . it has been well documented throughout the South that integration of school sports is an important first step in improving race relations . It does n't always progress much beyond school chauvinism , however , as was illustrated some time back in south Georgia when the Valdosta High foothali team got its first black player and opposed a team with several blacks on the field . After a play in which several of the black opponents seemed to pile on the lone Valdosta black , an excited fan shouted from the stands : " You nine= leave our colored boy alone ! " If Mr. Ashley can point with pride at some of the strides made by Unadilla High , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't impressed . Some of the more affluent among these parents have chosen to send their children to Fullington Academy , housed in a former public school a few miles outside of Unadilla . At Fullington , more than 400 youngsters attend allwhite classes , and their families spend a minimum of $500 a year for each pupil 's education . An Important Distinction Fullington , it should be understood , is n't technically segregated despite the total absence of blacks . " We have n't had any blacks apply , " the headmaster says , " but if one did , he would be tested just like any other applicant . " This distinction is important to the school because a stated policy of segregation would preclude tax-exempt status for gifts to the institution . It should also be understood that many parents here claim that Fullington 's allwhite status is n't the primary reason for sending a child to the private academy . " Race mixing was n't the No. 1 reason I sent my children ( to Fullington ) , " says James Riles , president of Exchange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mr. Riles , like many backers of Fulling- ton , Weida that the price of integrating public schools has been the destruction of quality education . " As far as I 'm concerned . " be asserts , " the federal government has ruined the school system " by forcing iotagrafton . He adds : " There is no way you can take these kids who just are n't capable , and many of them just do n't give a damn , and put them together when NM of them are like that and only 15% want to , and can , learn . That 's what 's happened to our public schools here . " Some consider it significant , however , that despite Mr. Riles 's feelings , his bank continues to support fund-raising functions at the public schools . This is n't true of some other local businessmen . Driving his pickup past a store operated by backers of the private school . Mr Ashley comments : " They wo n't even buy an ad in the school annual . " Help From the Economy Mr. Ashley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children back from Fullington Academy , a development for which he credits the economy . ( Doody County is largely agricultural ; but there are a few small industries , and they are having their troubles . ) White enrollment at Unadilla High , the principal says , is already up slightly , and be hopes for further gains . " I hope we 'll have 50-50 , and I believe we can , " Mr. Ashley says . He also believes that black representation on the school board is in the future , although no blacks have sought the office to date . In the meantime , black students at Unadllla High say school rules are enforced fairly and impartially in most instances . ( One exception , they say , is the ban on so-called corn-row hair fashions favored by some blacks . The ban , Faye Hunter says , has " got to be racist . We are the only ones who do their hair that way . " ) And while there are still youths in the school who make it difficult to attain complete racial harmony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long . " We figure it is going to take two more years , " the principal says . " When we first integrated , you had a lot of seventh- and eighth-graders who had never been to school with the other race . Now , they 'll be getting out . "
