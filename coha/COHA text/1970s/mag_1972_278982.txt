O CONGRESS <P> by DONALD RIEGLE with TREVOR ARMBRISTER <P> 297 pages . Doubleday . $7.95 . <P> Michigan Republican Donald Riegle was elected to Congress at 28 , boyishly glamorous and unabashedly candid about his ambitions to fetch up in the White House . Now , at 34 , he is a disenchanted public servant who likes to link himself with those " beautiful kids " whose " day is coming . " O Congress is Congressman Riegle 's yearlong diary ( beginning in April of last year ) , kept while Congress was in session and printed , he says , to " prompt a few young people to enter politics . " Yet Riegle 's account of his frustrations in one of America 's most intractable institutions seems far more likely to turn young idealists away from Congress - at least as an instrument for change . <P> It did not take the new Congressman long to learn that he had only three unhappy choices in the House of Representatives : 1 ) " play the game and be one of the boys , " hoping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to influence policy through administrative jobs at federal , state or city levels back home ; 3 ) stay and fight outside " established traditional paths . " Riegle chose the third , even though , as he concedes , he became " an outsider " as a result , with his long-term political career and immediate re-election in doubt . " If the country is in jeopardy , " he says , " and you 're not prepared to force a change , then your political future does n't mean anything on moral or practical grounds . " <P> Much of Republican Riegle 's rage and despair reflect his feelings about his party chief and President , Richard M. Nixon . The President , he says , urged him to run in 1966 . In 1968 Nixon told him , " Well , you know , Don , if we 're elected , we 'll end this war in six months . " But the war went on . Largely for that reason , Riegle became one of a small band of liberal anti-Nixon Republicans . He soon found himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not even get Nixon to pose with the little Michigan girl who had been chosen for the annual cystic fibrosis poster . <P> Riegle 's judgments may be questionable , but his irascibility is uninhibited by any concern for political expedience . He describes the men around Nixon as " unprincipled sons of bitches . " He is instinctively antiEstablishment . Riegle was doing well as a promising junior computer executive for IBM until he was sent home from work one day for wearing a blue shirt instead of a white one . He quit . <P> In Congress , Riegle found the work load for a conscientious Representative almost intolerable , and he admits that his accomplishments have been negligible . A typical day 's mail brought him 88 letters from his district , seven invitations to appear or speak , eight letters from colleagues seeking legislative support . Overworked on the House Appropriations Committee , where he felt he could easily use five staff assistants , and constantly required to fly home to serve constituents and attend meetings , Riegle felt " like a piece of meat being hauled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
