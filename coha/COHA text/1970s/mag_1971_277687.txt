SENT to Spain to interview George C. Scott for this week 's cover story , Correspondent Mary Cronin was apprehensive on two counts . There had been so much trouble on the set of Scott 's new movie that Director John Huston had resigned and an actress had been fired . Then there was the star 's legendary capacity for booze , brawls and belligerence . Would he be in the mood for calm , candid talk ? As a rule , said Cronin , " Scott does not look for a fight , but things build up in him or around him until something has to give . " <P> For two days Scott was not available for interviews ; Cronin could only wait him out . Then , during a brief conversation in the actor 's trailer , she became convinced that " talking about himself is not his favorite pastime . " Finally she found the key . She asked , " Why do n't we talk about acting in America ? " A three-hour outdoor lunch followed , then a series of morning and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ During the sessions , Scott was candid and articulate , though Cronin sensed that " everyone on the set was a little afraid of him . " There was an occasional beer ( with a vodka chaser ) , but nothing more . The cussedness ? " The Spanish crew was crazy about him , and he treated them as fellow workers . He played cards and chess with them . " <P> Cronin , an experienced show business reporter , concluded that Scott " was very professional about the interviews , very honest . He is probably the most interesting and least self-involved actor I 've ever talked to . I liked him tremendously . " It was almost as if Scott were determined to live up to the nickname that Actress Maureen Stapleton and Director Fielder Cook applied to him in their interviews with Reporter-Researcher Michele Whitney-Big Pussycat . <P> The material gathered by Cronin , Whitney and others went to Jay Cocks , one of TIME 'S cinema critics , who has seen every one of Scott 's movies and his recent plays ; Cocks wrote the story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm concerned , " says Cronin , whose 50-page file provided the basic ingredients , " we ought to put Scott on both the back and front covers . Then we could do two stories : it would take that much to deal with his complexities . "
