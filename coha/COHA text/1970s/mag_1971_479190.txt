ONCE UPON A TIME , two professors at the same university wrote two books , both on aspects of the American future . They were published almost simultaneously . One was very good ; the other was not . The poorer book was excerpted in The New Yorker , it got respectful and sometimes rhapsodic reviews in many national publications , its paperback rights sold for $375,000 , and it promptly became a fashionable cult-object . The better one has not , at this writing , been reviewed anywhere except in the Yale Daily News and is never likely to become either a best seller or the subject of conversation at chic dinner parties . For publishers and writers , this set of facts may look discouraging . 0 Justice , where are you ? But let 's not be too hasty . After all , many a good book ? including Moby Dick and Walden ? attracted practically no attention until long after publication , while many a best seller survived hardly a year . So I would he willing to gamble , out of some years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book will be virtually forgotten and that the sounder one will grow in influence for a decade or more . The next generation of undergraduates may find , indeed , that it is required reading in many colleges . I do n't propose to review these books ; that is the business of another department . But I do think it might be useful to explore some of their implications ? perhaps unintended ones ? for what they suggest about the way we may be living in the United States during the years just ahead . The Greening of America by Charles Reich , a law professor at Yale , is an evangelical tract , an exhortation to all of us to come and be saved by conversion to Consciousness II/ . By that he means the life-style currently favored by many adolescents of the affluent middle class : hedonistic , hairy , impulsive , anti-rational , anti-organization , and contemptuous of the straight society . Never mind ahout Consciousnesses I and II . As everybody must know by this time , they are Reich 's put-down terms for the values @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in the intolerable to him ) present . I have never met Mr. Reich , but he sounds like a spiritual cousin of Norman 0 . Brown ? an aging Ponce de Leon , wistfully soaking himself in the waters of the youth culture . In his eyes , American history is an unrelieved nightmare , and the Corporate State in which he thinks we live today is inhuman . He proposes to end it , not by violent revolution ( unnecessary ) or reform ( a laugh ) , but apparently by magic . Once we have all attained the proper state of consciousness , " the power of the Corporate State will he ended , as miraculously as a kiss breaks a witch 's evil enchantment . " IN HIS BOOK , . After the Revolution ? , ' Robert A. Dahl , a political-science professor at Yale , attacks some of the same evils belabored by Reich . He is equally ? though more coherently ? bothered by the irresponsible power of the modern corporation . He too is deeply concerned with the failure of American society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fair degree of economic equality , and a more democratic political system . Along with Reich , he he lievcs that " the old patterns of authority ' are losing out , " and cherishes a vision of a better future , maybe . But here end all similarity between the two books Dahl 's style is lucid rather that lyrical . His argument is tightly rea soned , not apocalyptic . Neither does h. count on a miraculous kiss to brim about the changes this country needs He knows they demand hard work sacrifice , and self-discipline ? qualitie despised by the Consciousness III cull Authority is being challenged becaus democracy " has always been and is no , a potentially revolutionary doctrine . Democracy has never been completel realized anywhere , so any system whit calls itself democratic is vulnerable t the charge that it is not " really " c " fully " what it claims to be . Can this charge be met ? Is it possib to devise a system democratic enoug to be generally acceptable , and y armed with enough authority to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreements which always boil up with : every group of people ? What kinds democracy might work best in diffcre circumstances ? in a commune of dozen families , in a giant corporatio and in some future world governmen What can be done to cure the feeling so many people ? especially the poor , t black , and the young ? that they a Powerless , lacking any effective voice the decisions which shape their live These are the main questions Dahl sr out to answer ; and to me , at least , 1 answers are persuasive . The Good ciety he envisages does n't look a bit li the happy pastoral anarchy that Rei longs for , but it clearly would be a better than the America of today . THE EASY CHAIR S UT BOTH WRITERS FORESHADOW the end of the Age of Affluence ? Reich explicitly and with glee , Dahl only by implication . I suspect they arc both right , in different ways . The moral basis of our prosperity is. of course , the work ethic and the Puritan tradition , for reasons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his Religion and the Rise of Capitalism . The men who made America rich , from George Washington to Andrew Carnegie and Henry Ford , believed that hard work was not only a duty but a virtue , one which God would reward in hard cash . Most of our corporate executives probably believe much the same thing today . The structural basis of our prosperity is , just as obviously , the American talent for large-scale organization . This talent produced the modern corporation and the great government agencies -- the Federal Reserve Board . TVA , Maritime Commission , Department of Defense , and dozens of others ? which complement it . Mass production is not possible without such organization : neither is the research which has turned out such innovations as the computer , space vehicles , atomic power , and plastic martini glasses . Such organization demands hierarchy . discipline , and long-range planning . It depends , moreover , on a great many people who are willing to save : that is , to deny themselves immediate gratification in hopes of reward at some later date . Savings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or socialist : though authoritarian systems have the advantage of being able to force saving , to a considerable degree , while democratic systems must rely on voluntary self-denial . Although much of The Greening of 4merica strikes me as pure moonshine. unsupported either by facts or logic , 1 believe it does make one valid point . A growing number of young people clearly are rejecting the Puritan tradition , the work ethic , hierarchical authority of any kind , and the very idea of organization . Because they pride themselves on being Now People , reveling in spontaneity and instant gratification , both saving and rational long-range planning are abhorrent to them . Such Consciousness TT1 attitudes may wear away as they gron up : having a couple of babies to feed is a sobering experience . But if they do persist , large-scale organizations ? corporate and bureaucratic ? may eventually find it hard to man their hierarchies . Can you imagine a General Electric junior executive who insists on THE EASY CHAIR making his decisions with the help of tarot cards and the I Ching , rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flowing tresses and love beads could be downright dangerous . Perhaps this is what Reich means by the ? miraculous " ending of the Corporate State ; it 's hard to tell . P ERSONALLY I HAVE A GOOD DEAL of sympathy for many of the notions burgeoning among the young . After I had worked successively for the Asso. elated Press , the federal government , and the Army , I decided at a fairly early age that I never again would have any part of a big organization . Since then I have managed to make a living of sorts by free-lance writing and in publishing , where the typical firm is relatively small . Moreover , I enjoy living in a small community , although it is n't exactly a commune . Like my hippie friends , I prefer woods and meadows to concrete : I raise as much of my household 's food as my organic garden will produce ; and I usually dress much the way they do , in jeans and a work shirt , putting on a tie only for funerals and trips to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I knew from the start , this kind of life-style is not compatible with making a lot of money . If large numbers of people should opt for something like it , the gross national product is bound to slide off pretty steeply . I do n't regard that as a bad thing . Indeed , as I have argued here in recent months , I do n't believe that this country can long survive at its present rates of consumption of raw materials and of filth-pro. ( ruction . Nevertheless , I am not as sure as a lot of Reich 's admirers that they will find voluntary poverty a happy way of life . For one thing , I 've been poor ? hungry-poor ? and it was n't much fun . Besides . many young people not only are uninterested in making a lot of money , which is to their credit : they also seem unable to tolerate the minimal labor and self-discipline necessary to make a bare living . " Living close to nature " can be a backbreaking business , as any subsistence farmer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raise any hogs ? ) And I do n't see how the creative kids are going to make it by handcrafting sandals and jewelry to barter among themselves . Nor can they survive as " street people , " ripping off a parasitic existence on the fringe of the affluent society , once that society goes out of business . For a good many of the Consciousness III crowd , then , the future may not be quite as green as Mr. Reich predicts . Aftl , HAS NOTHING TO SAY , explicitly , .1fiabout the affluent society , or the growth in Reichian attitudes which seems likely to undermine it . Instead he has drawn an intellectual road map to guide us toward a more nearly perfect democracy . It is probable , I think , that America will move in that direction ; indeed , in my view we have been heading that way , with a good many violent zigzags , for decades- Like all ideals in an imperfect world , a perfectly democratic system can never be attained ? but if we keep edging toward it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and more evenhanded in the distribution of power . As a by-product , I suspect , it also will become less affluent . For the economic machinery which has made the United States rich is primarily the creation of the prosperous middle class ; traditionally , that class has run the machine and has been its chief beneficiary . But as power ? both political and economic ? shifts away from the middle class to the hands of the poor and the formerly disenfranchised minorities , I suspect that our fabulously productive economic machine will begin to strip some gears . Specifically , we can expect a falling off in the rate of savings and productive investment , and a continuing ? perhaps uncontrollable ? inflation . The process already is under way . Organized labor has seized for itself much of the power which once rested pith management : and , as a onetime union member , T have no doubt that in many ways the country is the better for it . One result , however , is clearly bad for everybody . including labor . Wage rates keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have recently seen , all the muscles of government apparently are unable to halt this inflationary spiral . Perhaps nothing can halt it , short of breaking the unions ? and even in a far-from-perfect democracy , that is politically impossible . Now that public employees have learned the trick from the industrial unions , their wages are shoot ing up too . Garbage haulers , teachers , bus drivers , and policemen can hold a pistol at the head of any mayor , and often do , in defiance of no-strike laws . True , some of them have long been underpaid . But their present fast catch-up is forcing city after city to the edge of bankruptcy , pushing taxes to suicidal levels , and driving industry out into the boondocks . Other underprivileged and once-help. less groups are following their example . Welfare clients are organizing to demand a better deal ; some kind of guaranteed income or negative income tax , therefore , looks inevitable within the next few years . Cesar Chavez has succeeded in organizing migrant farm workers ? always thought to be unorganizable ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both economic and political clout . Negroes are being elected to office in unprecedented numbers throughout the country , with the consequence that blacks are now beginning to get the municipal services and patronage jobs long denied them . Such gains are simple justice . They also are making America a more humane place , although that may be hard to believe in these days of lamentation . For example , the new census figures indicate that the number of families living in poverty has dropped from 18 per cent to 1.0 per cent within the past decade . For two reasons , however , such gains are likely to result in a lower rate of savings , and thus a slowdown in economic growth . First , low-income families , even when they rise above the poverty line , spend practically all they earn , and who can blame them ? After years of living on sow belly and grits , they deserve a steak now and then . Second , the middle class , which historically has done most of the nation 's saving , also pays most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? particularly state and local taxes ? many middle-class families will find it harder to put anything away . Besides , in a time of continuing inflation they have little incentive to save . Why put a dollar in the bank . when it may be worth only fifty cents a few years from now ? IN ONE OF THE MOST interesting see . Lions of his book , Dahl touches or another possible development which might also threaten American affluence That is a change in the governance . co the great corporations . They are now the most undemocratic institutions in our society . They are self perpetuating autocrats , responsible to nobody . And they wield enormou : power . General Motors has gross re ceipts about the same as the gross na tional product of Sweden , as Dab points out . Its employees and their fam ilies roughly equal the population o New Zealand . Its outlays are " larger than those of the central government of France or West Germany . " When a strike closes it don n. the whole economy slumps . Under these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead of public is an absurdity . " Nevertheless , according to the official American mythology , General Motors ? like the other corporations which dominate our economy and much of our politics  - -  belongs " to its stockholders , to whom its management is theoretically answerable . In fact , as we all know , the individual stockholder does not and can not exercise any real control over the management of the typical big corporation . ( Exceptions are a few firms ? Ford , DuPont , the Hughes Tool Company ? which are still controlled by a family or individual . ) Forty years ago , Berle and Means , in their classic , The Modern Corporation and Private Property , demonstrated how completely ownership had become divorced from management . Today the separation is even more complete , because the controlling stock interest often is held not by individuals , but by mutual funds , bank trust departments , and pension funds . As a matter of policy , they normally want nothing to do with management ; if they disapprove of the way a firm is being run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the management of a big corporation is a free-floating quantum of power , behaving however it likes , subject only to the market , bankruptcy . a takeover bid , the occasional intervention of government , or the sting of a Ralph Nader. ? If we are in the midst of a long-continuing democratic revolution , as Dahl suggests , society is not likely to tolerate such unbridled corporate power forever , Yet it is hard to hit upon a better alternative . The bureaucratic socialism of Russia is even worse , less efficient , and less responsive either to consumers or to employees . The democratic socialism of England does n't look too good either . Witness that country 's chronic economic crises , and the frequent , paralyzing strikes in its nationalized industries . Other semi-socialized states . such as Sweden and Australia , are too different from America in size and character to offer useful models . ' ' ' The best recent book on this subject that I have seen is The American Corporation : Its Power , Its Money , Ifs PotinrA , by Richard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more revolu ? tionary than any document yet produced , to my knowledge , by the New Left . Dahl suggests , cautiously and tentatively , that the system of " self-manageTUNIC developed in Yugoslavia might be worth considering for adaptation here . Workers ' councils , mainly elected by employees , have a considerable voice it , the management of most enterprises , from factories to hospitals and the postal service . To be sure , state planners and the League of Communists also have a voice , and in a pinch the decisive one . Nevertheless , the Yugo. slays do seem to be creating a kind of decentralized socialism , with a good deal of genuine worker participation . is more productive , apparently , than du Russian system , and far less cumbersome and oppressive . Though well aware of the difficulties in adapting such a scheme to the American scene , Dahl thinks it might prove better thar any other alternatives now in sight . I too would be glad to see sonic ex. periments in this direction . Like Dahl I ca n't think of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shouk be less successful in hiring corporate executives than our present boards ? which in practice are usually self-per petuating and dominated by manage merit , But there is one objection which Dahl does not mention . Employee-di rectors almost certainly would insis that a firm pay out a bigger share of it : income in wages , and devote less t ( research and investment in new plant If they did not do so , they would sow be replaced by their worker constitu eats . Today , undistributed profits plowed back into corporate . business make up a big slice of the national say ings . Once this source of investmen shrinks , technical innovation and pro ductivity are bound to shrink too . Undemocratic as it is , the modert American corporation has been phe nomenally productive . Any scheme ti make it more democratic in govern ance , it seems to me , is likely to make i less productive ? and the society les affluent . Again , that might well be a goo , thing . But if we do move toward a mgr equal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dahl path ( or both ) we ought to do so with our eyes oper awaie of the price we 'll have to pay . W may find that ii simply is n't possible t have a " really " democratic society an a prosperous one at the same time . Pe haps then the motto on the dollar , " 1 God We Trust , " eventually will be r placed with a new one : " Pour Equal . "
