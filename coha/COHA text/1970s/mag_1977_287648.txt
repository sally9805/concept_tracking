" There are two major groups of potential opponents who need to be assessed , " Pollster Pat Caddell wrote last December , " the Democratic Party and the Republican Party . In many ways , the former may be more dangerous than the latter . " <P> Jimmy Carter 's favorite nose counter could hardly have been more correct . Last week the simmering dispute between the President and Capitol Hill broke into the open , with congressional members of Carter 's own party leading the battle . Within three days Democrat-led committees in both chambers voted to load Administration proposals with more than $3.5 billion in extra money . <P> By doing so , the legislators were directly challenging Carter and imperiling his announced goal of a balanced budget by 1981 . The President picked up the gauntlet at his news conference . In a five-minute opening statement , he politely but quite plainly threatened to veto bills that did not meet his standards of fiscal responsibility . <P> A particular sore point was Carter 's original " hit list " of 32 water projects . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ projects . Then the House Public Works Appropriations Subcommittee restored 17 of the 18 projects still on Carter 's list . ( The lone loser : the $1 million Grove Lake , Kans. , flood-control project . ) Carter met three times with the subcommittee chairman , Alabama Congressman Tom Bevill , 56 , with little result . The President then enlisted the aid of House Majority Leader Thomas ( " Tip " ) O'Neill Jr. , who was only able to persuade Bevill to cut small sums from five of the projects . Next O'Neill went to Texas ' George Mahon , chairman of the full Appropriations Committee , which passes on Bevill 's work . " Tip , " said Mahon , " you 're right-but there 's nothing we can do about it . We do n't have the votes . " Last week Mahon 's committee passed Bevill 's bill without even the formality of a vote . Mourned O'Neill : " It 's all a matter of party-line discipline-it 's not here any more . " <P> In the Senate , the $4.8 billion Farm Bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Iowa farmers , " We will make sure that our support prices are at least equal to the cost of production . " But growers called his proposed support prices-including wheat at $2.60 per bu. - inadequate and " cruel . " Carter upped the prices ( wheat went to $2.90 ) . But both houses of Congress raised them higher still : the House committee put wheat at $3.00 , the Senate at $3.10 . Last week the Senate approved its more generous Farm Bill by a lopsided margin of 69 to 18-more than the two-thirds that would be necessary to override a presidential veto . Maine Senator Edmund Muskie complained that the bill would add $8 billion to the budget during the next four years . <P> Right and Duty . Congressional committees also approved a $61.3 billion appropriation for Labor and HEW that was $2.1 billion more than Carter had requested . Given these setbacks , Carter 's press-conference response was a measured one . Said he : " I respect the Congress , and I will work day and night to reach an agreeable solution to these potential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I have to reserve the right and the duty to say no when spending is excessive . "
