" What are you doing , Theo ? Tell me about yourself . I 've got to go out to dinner , but I have a whole hour before I have to dress . Can we sit down and have a drink somewhere ?

" I told him what I had been doing and what I was doing . I pulled out of my purse a clipping of the advertisement I had placed in the Newport paper . There was something refreshing and moving about the selflessness of his attention , but I was soon aware that it was precisely the relief of not talking or thinking about himself that he was enjoying . Finally I fell silent . His eyes kept returning to the clipping . " You know all these languages ?

They tell me I 'm as well known over there as Richthofen is over here . Can you understand how I feel about it ? " " Yes , I do . " " Gee , it 's great seeing you again . It gives me the strength I need to put this thing through . Do n't you think I owe them the courtesy of making an attempt to speak German ?

I 'd like to be a streetcar conductor . , I 'd like to be a telephone repairman ! " He brushed his hand across his forehead and looked about him almostp120feverishly ; then concluded with forced joviality , " I 'd like to break my engagement tonight and go out to dinner with you , but I ca n't , " and he sat down again . " Well , " I said in German , " I 'm not leaving town . We can have dinner some other night . " He pushed his glass backward and forward broodingly , as though that possibility was doubtful .

" In 1921 , in my city three large companies and five prominent families went bank-rupt . " " Did you have any inkling of that when I saw you in Paris ? " He pointed to his head . " Oh , more than an inkling . But fortunatelyI was engaged to a girl with considerable means . I told her that I had nothing but my severance pay . She laughed and said , ' Darling , of course , you have money . You 're engaged to look after my property and you 'll be very well paid for that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars getting to the church . " In 1919 and 1920 and in the years immediately following I came to know a large number of combat veterans  --  to say nothing , for the present , of those whom it was my duty to interrogate in a later war . ( My part in " Rip 's war , " as has been said , had been safely passed among the defenders of Narragansett Bay . ) As could be expected the marks left by that experience on the veteran varied from man to man ; but in one group the aftereffects were partic/ularly striking  --  the airmen . The fighting men on land and sea in early youth experienced what journalists called their " glorious hour "  --  the sense of weighty responsibility bound up with belonging to a " unit , " exposure to extreme fatigue , to danger , and to death ; many carried the inner burden of having killed human beings . But the " hour " of the first generation of combat aviators comprised all this and something in addition . Air combat was new ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of technical accomplishment above the earth filled them with a particularkind of pride and elation . There were no gray-haired officers above them . They were pioneers and frontiersmen . Their relations with their fellow-fliers and even with their enemies partook of a high camaraderie . Unrebuked , they invented a code of chivalry with the German airmen . None would have stooped to attack a disabledenemy plane trying to return to its home base . Both sides recognized enemies with whom they had had encounters earlier , signaled to them in laughing challenge . They lived " Homerically " ; that was what the Iliad was largely about  --  young , brilliant , threatened lives . ( Goethe said , " The Iliad teaches us that it is our task here on earth to enact hell daily . " ) Many survivors were broken by it and their later lives were a misery to themselves and to others . ( " We did n't have the good fortune to die , " as one of them said to me . ) Others continued to live long and stoic lives . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was evident that a " spring had broken down " in them , a source of courage and gaiety had been depleted , had been spent . Such was Rip . There was some discussion as to where Rip and I could meet for an eight o'clock class . " I 'd like you to come over to my place , but the children would be having their breakfast and my wife would be running in and out to remind me of things I should do . " " I think Bill Wentworth would let us use one of those social rooms behind the gallery at the Casino . We might have to move from room to room while they 're cleaning up . I 've never seen you in the Casino , but I assume Your Honor is a member there . "  |p122He  grinned and held his hand beside his mouth as though it were an unholy secret . " I 'm a life-member . They do n't let me pay any dues , " and he poked me as though he 'd stolen the cookie jar . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed by an hour of conversation , in which I played the role of a German officer . Rip owned a collection of books in both languages describing those great days . No session passed without his being called to the telephone from which he returned with an enlarged list of the day 's agenda , but he had a notable gift for immediately resuming his concentration . There was no doubt that he derived great enjoyment from the work ; it touched some deep layer of selfrecoverywithin him . He studied intensively between sessions ; and so did I. ( " Did his homework , " as he called it . ) My daily program permitted little time for desultory conversation at the close of the lesson , nor did his . When he rose he consulted the list of errands he must do : register certain letters at the Post Office ; take the dog to the vet 's ; call for Miss So-and-so , his wife 's part-time secretary ; take Eileen to Mrs. Brandon 's dancing class at eleven and call for her at twelve . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater part of the day . His appearance began to improve ; he laughed more frequently , with some of the buoyancy of our first meeting on Bellevue Avenue . But there was no word that he had received permission to go to Germany . One evening I paid my respects at Mrs. Cranston 's . " Good evening , Mr. North , " Mrs. Cranston said graciously , eyeing a straw box I was carrying . It was lined with moss and contained some jack-in-the-pulpits , trilliums , and other flowers whose names I did not know . " Wild flowers ! Oh , Mr. North , how could you know that I value wild flowers above all others ! " " I believe , ma'am , that it 's against the law to dig some of these up , but at least I rode outside the city limits to gather them . I 've also borrowed a trowel and a flashlight and am ready to replant them around your house at any point you indicate to me. "  |p123Henry  Simmons happened at that moment to enter from the street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought me . Henry , help him replant them under Edweena 's window where she will find them when she returns . A gift like that is a gift to us all and I thank you heartily for my share in it . " She tapped her table bell . " Jerry will bring you a pitcher of water . That will make the flowers feel at home at once . " Neither Henry nor I was an experienced horticulturist , but we did our best . Then we washed our hands and returned to the parlor where some illicit refreshment was waiting for us . " We have missed you lately , " said Mrs. Cranston . " We thought you had shifted your affections to Narragansett Pier , Teddie , I swear we did . " " And I missed you , ma'am , and you , Henry . I have some lateeveningstudents now ; and on some days my schedule is so crowded that I fall into bed at ten o'clock . " " Now you 're not going to overwork and make a dull dog of yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Money ! " I sighed . " I 'm still hunting for that little apartment . I 've looked at a dozen , but the rent is more than I 'm ready to pay . A number of my older students have offered to make me a present of a very acceptable apartment in their former stable or an empty gardener 's house , but I have learned the rule that the relations between landlord and tenant should be as impersonal as possible . " " It 's a very good rule , but admits of an occasional exception , " replied Mrs. Cranston , tacitly alluding to Edweena 's possession of the " garden apartment " and probably to a number of her other lodgers . " I think I 've found the real right thing . It 's not in an elegant neighborhood . The furnishings are modest but neat and clean ; and it 's within my means , after I 've done a bit more haggling . I am not of a spendthrift nature , Mrs. Cranston , being wholly Newp124England on my father 's side and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I am what New Englanders call ' near . ' Schoolboyssay ' chinchy . ' " Mrs. Cranston laughed . " In Rhode Island we often say ' close . ' I am not ashamed to say that I am fairly ' close ' in my dealings . " Henry was indignant . " Why , Mrs. Cranston , you are the most generous person I 've ever known . You have a heart of gold ! " " I never liked that expression , Henry . I would not have been able to run this house and keep my head above water , if I had not been ' careful . ' There 's another word for you , Mr. North . I hate close-fisted stinginess , of course ; but I certainly recommend a firm grasp on what money should and should not do . " She sat back in her chair , warming up to the subject . " Now twenty and thirty years ago Newport was famous for reckless spending . You would n't believe the amount of money that could be thrown away in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But also you would n't believe the stories of miserliness , penny-pinching , meannesses  --  what'sthe word that 's the opposite of extravagance , Mr. North ? " " Parsimony ? " " That 's it ! " " Avarice ? " " Listen to that , Henry : That 's what comes of a college education ; hitting the nail on the head . Edweena 's fond of saying that extravagance  --  give me another word , Mr. North . " " Conspicuous waste . " " Oh , what a beauty !  --  that conspicuous waste and avarice are related ; they 're two sides of the same desperateness . ' Newport avarice , ' she used to say , ' was of a special kind . They all had millions , but their behavior was like a fever-chart : it would go up and down . ' There was one hostess who would send out invitations for a big party  --  two hundred on gold plate ; catering and additional staff from Delmonico 's or Sherry 's . But four days before the party she 'd come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing . When this had happened a number of times her dearest friends made plans for an emergency dinner ' in case of another cancellation . She was the same lady who went through two seasons in two evening gowns ; she appeared in the black or the purple one . She 'd write orders for dresses to be sent up from New York , but she 'd forget to mail the letter . These people think that no one notices ! There 's some demon inside them that robs them of the ability to look an expenditure in the face . It 's a sickness , really . " Here followed some staggering examples of penuriousness and " trimming . " " Why , " said Henry , " there 's a woman in town now  --  a very young woman , too . She 's married to a man as famous as General Pershing " Almost , Henry . " " Thank you , ma'am . Almost as famous ' as General Pershing . " " No names , remember ! A rule of the house . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She 's given half a dozen shelters to communities around here and pays their upkeep . She 's on the National Anti-carve-'em-up Society . She gets hysterical about feathers on hats . But the stories  --  " Mrs. Cranston broke in : " Mr. North , she does much of her own shopping . She puts on a thick brown veil , gets in her car , and goes down to those shipping supply shops ; sends her chauffeur inside to tell the butcher that ' Mrs. Edom ' would like to speak to him outside . Mrs. Edom was the woman who used to be her housekeeper . She buys a whole side of beef from the salt-barrel . Takes two weeks to soak the salt out of it  --  half-soak the salt out . That 's what the national hero and his children eat . She drives out to the Portuguese market and buys great milk cans of their kale soup with their linguifa sausages in it . When her servants protest and resign she scarcely gives them a civil letter of recommendation . She replaces them from those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes of an old Bellevue Avenue family andp126she must keep up her social position . About every ten days she gives a dinner party  --  catering from Providence ; spends all the money she skimped for . Oh , it makes me boil  --  to think of that wonderful husband of hers and her children living on corned beef and kale soup while she spends thousands on dogs and cats ! " " Well , Mrs. Cranston , we have a saying in the Old Country : kind to animals , cruel to humans . " " It 's a kind of sickness . Mr. North , let 's talk about something pleasant . " I came to know the limits to which Mrs. Cranston could go in discussing any unfavorable aspect of the Newport she loved . The lessons went on in fine shape , but the sweeping and dustingand the telephone calls from Rip 's home were no small inconvenience . One day Rip asked me : " Do you ever take pupils on Sunday morning ? " " Yes , I have . " " Could you manage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My wife goes to church then ; I do n't . . . . Would that be all right ? . . . So I 'll pick you up at the ' Y ' next Sunday at a quarter before eleven . I 'll take you to a classroom where we wo n't be disturbed . I belong to a club called the Monks ' Club ' ; it 's a sort of shooting , fishing , drinking , and dining club , with a little dice-rattling on the side now and then . It 's just over the line in Massachusetts , beyond Tiverton . It belongs to a little group of the lively set . No ladies allowed , but every now and then you see some girls there  --  from New Bedford or Fall River . No one ever shows up before sunset , especially not on Sunday . The Monks have pretty much given up hunting . " He added with his confidential grin , " Very expensive membership , but they made me an honorary member  --  no dues ! . . . A great place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an hour 's drive disturbed me a little . I 'd come to like and admire Rip more and more , but I did n't want to hear his " story "  - -  how Gulliver came to be bound supinep127by a thousand small silk threads . It was a woeful situation , but there was nothing I could do about it . I felt in my bones that he was burning to tell me the story  --  the whole sorry business . So far I had never met Mrs. Vanwinkle and had no wish to . I have a ready interest in eccentrics and my Journal was filled with their " portraits , " but I shrank from those borderline cases that approach madness  --  raging jealousy , despotic possessiveness , neurotic avarice . Rip 's wife appeared to me to be stark staring mad . This view had been confirmed by a strange event that happened to intrude itself into my daily routine . I had a pupil whom I was preparing for the college entrance examination in French , a girl of seventeen . Penelope Temple and I were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mr. North , please forgive me , but the upstairs telephone is in use and I want to answer a call here . I think it will be very brief . " I rose . " Shall we go into another room , Mrs. Temple ? " " It 's not necessary . . . . It 's a woman I never met . . . . Yes , Mrs. Vanwinkle ? This is Mrs. Temple speaking . I 'm sorry to have made you wait , but Mr. Temple is expecting an urgent call on the other telephone . . . . Yes . . . Yes . . . It is true , those were egret feathers I was wearing at the ball when that photographwas taken . . . . Excuse me , let me interrupt . . . . Those feathers belonged to my mother . They are at least thirty years old . We have preserved them with great care . . . . Excuse me interrupting you : the feathers are now falling to pieces and I shall destroy them , as you request @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Vanwinkle to this house . Any home in America would be proud to receive Mr. Vanwinkle , but he is too distinguished a man to go about town picking up dilapidated feathers . . . . No , Mrs. Vanwinkle , I wish you to do me the credit of believing me when I tell you that I will destroy the wretched feathers at once . Good morning , Mrs. Vanwinkle , thank you for your call . . . . Excuse me again , Mr. North . Penelope , I think the woman 's insane . "  |p128Twenty  minutes later the front door bell rang and down the hall I heard Rip 's voice in conversation with Mrs. Temple . Naturally , I did not mention this episode to Rip . Our first Sunday morning drive into Massachusetts was on a beautiful day in early July . Rip drove like Jehu , as all retired aviators do . Even in that aging car he exceeded the speed limits in city and country . The police never interfered ; they were proud to receive a wave of his hand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I plunged into my overworked theory about the nine cities of Troy and of Newport . I made a considerable digression about the great Bishop Berkeley as we passed near his house ( " I lived in Berkeley Oval in my freshman year at college , " he said ) . I had just about come to the end of my exposition when we drove up to the door of the Monks ' Club . He brought the car to a standstill but remained at the wheel gazing before him . " Ted ? " " Yes , Rip ? " " You remember that you asked me what I 'd like to do ? " " Yes . " " I 'd like to be a historian .... Is it too late ? " " Why , Rip , you 've got your niche in history . It is n't too late to pour out all you know about that  --  begin there and then broaden out . " His face clouded over . " Oh , I would n't want to write anything about that . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rochambeau and Washington and Berkeley  --  that reminded me that I 'd always wanted to be a historian . . . . Besides , a historian works in a study where he can close the door , does n't he ? Or he can go to some library where there 's a SILENCE sign on every table . " " Rip , " I ventured , " in New York is your life much like this  --  a lot of errands during the day and dinners out every night ? " He lowered his voice . " Worse , worse . In New York I do most of the shopping . "  | " But you have a housekeeper ! " " We had a housekeeper  --  Mrs. Edom . Oh , I wish she were back . Capable , you know  --  quiet and capable . No arguments . " The Monks ' Club had been an important roadside tavern before the Revolution . Many alterations had been made since . It had served as a storehouse , as a home , and as a school , but much of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chimneys and a vast kitchen . The front room must have been originally designed for dancing ; there was a fiddlers ' gallery oppositethe great fireplace . The " Monks " had furnished and adorned it as a luxurious hunting lodge , complete with some masterpieces of taxidermy . We worked upstairs in the library surrounded by maps , files of sporting magazines , law manuals of the Commonwealthof Massachusetts relative to shipping and game-hunting . The room overlooked the front entrance and was large enough for us to stride up and down in during our mock international dialogues . It was ideal for us . At one o'clock we used to collect our textbooks and reluctantly return to Rhode Island . During our second Sunday morning session the telephone rang at the bottom of the stairs . " I know who that is ! Come along , Ted , I want you to hear this . " " I do n't want to hear your private conversations , Rip . " " I want you to . You 're a part of this  --  you 're a part of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I swear to you , I need you to back me up ! . . . Hello ? Yes , this is the Monks ' Club ... . Oh , is that you , Pam ?

There are three lifeguards there  --  one on a scaffoldand two in rowboats ; and on the beach there are at least thirty nurses , nannies , governesses , Fraulein , mademoiselles , and gouvernantes . I can not and will not sit there for three hours amid a hundred women . . . .

I have to go back to my lesson now , but I do n't wish to hang up on my dear wife , so will you please hang up first ? ... Yes . . . Yes ... No . . . Goodbye , see you soon . " He rejoined me with raised eyebrows , saying : " Gulliver and the hundreds of silk threads . Every day I cut a few of them . " I made no comment and we went on with our work . He seemed to be reinvigorated , or should I say , proud of himself . I was getting caught up in a situation that was more than I could handle . What I needed was not advice  --  which I have seldom found profitable  --  but more facts ; not gossip but facts . I thought I knew the reason why Rip was a diminished man . I wanted to know more about his wife . I wanted to be sure that I was being just to her ; to be just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I felt that I had reached the end of what Mrs. Cranston and Henry Simmons could tell me . Where could I go for solid facts about Pamela Vanwinkle ? Suddenly I thought of Bill Wentworth . I asked him for a half hour of his time . Again at the end of the day I found myself in his office among the shining trophies . I told him about the Germanp131lessons , the constant interruptions , and the sheer servitude to which my friend had been reduced . " Bill , how long have you known Colonel Vanwinkle ? " " Let me see . Pamela Newsome  --  as I knew her  --  brought him here in the summer of 1921 soon after they were married . " " Had you known her long ? " " Since she was a child . During the summer she was in here every day ; since her marriage she scarcely appears here at all . Her parents are old Newporters . " " Are many Newporters aware of the tight reins she holds over him ? " " Mr. North , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How is it that she has so much money in her own name ? " " The Newsomes are not so much a family as a corporation . Every child on reaching twenty-one gets a large bundle of stock  --  well over a million , they say  --  and continues to get more annually . ... She was a very difficult girl . She never got on with her parents . Perhaps that 's the reason why  --  when she became engaged in the fall of 192o  --  they gave her their Newport cottage and themselvesstarted going to Bar Harbor for the summer . " " Excuse my frankness , Bill , but is she as miserly and hard-drivingas they say ? " " My wife was a long-time friend of their housekeeper , Mrs. Edom , a fine woman , a strong character . Mrs. Edom used to call on Mrs. Wentworth on an occasional Sunday morning . It broke her heart to see what Pamela was doing to the Colonel . You would n't believe what went on in that house . Mrs. Edom used to come to my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Colonel so few friends ? " " Everybody likes him  --  not only admires him , but likes him . But both men and women are made uncomfortable by the picture they see . Mr. North , before the war there were many young men around here who did nothing  --  simply enjoyed themselves and nobody thought the worse of them . But times have changed . They have jobs , even if they do n't need the money . Idleness is out ofp132fashion ; it 's made fun of . And everybody can see the bad effects of it . We 've seen it before  --  a poor man married to a very rich girl ; she cracks the whip and he jumps through the hoop like a monkey . " I gave him my picture of the young man who had had his " glorious hour " too early in life and whose vitality or will-power had been broken by it . I went on to tell him how Rip was beginning to lean on me to help him get some freedom . " Well , if you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If what I 've heard is right , he has n't a penny .

The second summer he was here the Board of Governorsmade him an honorary member of the Casino . I asked him to call on me the day before so that I could explain to him how we were setting up the ceremony . I told him that perhaps his wife might want to come , but he telephoned me later that she would be present at the ceremony , but that on that rehearsal morning she was busy with one of her cruelty to animals ' committees . Well , he arrived ; it 's always a pleasure to meet him  --  a fine fellow , and all that . I told him a photographer would be present ; we wanted the picture to hang on our walls . There it is ! We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Tennis ChampionshipWeek . I told him the Governors would be pleased if he wore his uniform and his medals . He said he had his uniform and a few medals .

' I have n't got them , Bill . ' Then he grinned . Do you know his grin ? " " Oh , yes , whenever he talks about his war record or his celebrityhe grins . " " He said that he 'd wanted to buy a birthday present for his wife on her first birthday since their marriage , and that he 'd borrowedp133money on them as security from those medal and trophy dealers in New York . Now , I 'll tell you one thing more : she did n't come to the ceremony . She hates his fame ; she 's afraid it may ' go to his head ' and spoil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job . He 'll be a different man . " " Thanks , Bill . Has he been offered any ? " " Of course he has  --  with that famous name of his . Corporation directorships , things like that . She wo n't let him consider them . You know he comes from western New York State . The Governor wanted to create one for him , provided that he 'd move to Albany . I heard it was about twenty thousand a year , State Marshal . His wife laughed at it . To her that 's peanuts . She said it was degrad-ing . " " Is it true that she feeds the family mostly salt beef and kale soup ? " " Oh . The town makes up stories about her . But she does buy canned goods by the gross . " So it is profitable to go to the right person for advice , after all .

" I caught a glimpse of " Mrs. Edom ' ' in a deep brown veil sitting in the car . I said loudly , " I think he gave orders that he was not to be disturbed on any account . Has something serious happened in his home ? Fire ? Appendicitis ? Mad dog bite ? " " I do n't . . . think so . " " Wait . I 'll see if he can be seen . Tell Mrs. Edom that his German professor is very strict about interruptions . He 's a holy terror . " Rip was waiting for me on the stairs . " She says she 's Mrs. Edam and she wishes to speak to you . " " She 'll come in . Nothing can stop her . " " I 'm going to lock the door leading upstairs . It 's half-past twelve already . I 'll stay down and keep her company . " " Damn it , I want to hear what you say . I 'm going to stretch out on the floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me from there . " I went down to the front room , locked the inner staircase door , put the key in my pocket , picked up a copy of Yachting , and sat down to read it . There was a noise up in the gallery . Rip had pulled a coverlet about himself and was lying down . The doorbell rang again . I opened the door and faced a determined woman . She had thrown the veil up about her hat  --  a very good-looking young woman , furious . She pushed the door open and passed me into the front room . " Good morning . " " Good morning , madam . Forgive me if I say that it is a rule of the club that ladies are not admitted here . There is no reception room for women . " " Kindly tell Colonel Vanwinkle that Mrs. Edom wishes to speak to him . " " Madam , as the chauffeur told you ... " She sat down . " Excuse me , are you the steward of the club ? "  | " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Who is in authority here ? ... Are there no servants here ? " " The caretaker and his wife seem to have gone to church . " " Sir , will you kindly tell me whom I am addressing ? " I was amiability  --  dare I say : charm ?  --  itself . " Mrs. Edom , surely you know something about men 's clubs . It 's a rule of the club that no member may be addressed by the name he bears in private life . We are addressed by the name given us by the Abbot . I am Brother Asmodius . The member to whom you have been referring is Brother Bellerophon . " " Childish nonsense ! " " Since the Middle Ages and the Crusaders ' Orders . I happen to be a Mason . and the member of a fraternity . In each club I have been assigned a name to be used in that club . You surely know that monks in a religious order do the same . My wife finds it hard to forgive me that I do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think I remember hearing that you are the housekeeper in Brother Bellerophon 's home . " She glared at me in silence . Then she rose , saying , " I will speak to the Colonel . " She went to the door leading upstairs and shook the knob . I was cleaning my fingernails . " That German professor locked it , I expect . I would n't put anything beyond him . " " I shall sit here until the Colonel comes down . " " Would you like something to read , Mrs. Edom ? " " No , thank you . " I resumed my reading in silence . She looked about her . " I see that you monks  --  as you call yourselves  --  shoot deer , foxes , and birds . Contemptible sports ! " " There 's less and less of that now . You can understand why . " She stared at me in silence . " Out of respect for Brother Bellerophon'swife . " Silence . " Surely , you know of her crusade for the prevention of cruelty to animals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be ! Saves the lives of dogs and cats and wild animals every year ! A great heart ! A big heart ! "  |p136I  strolled across the room to straighten a picture . Nonchalantly I added , " Having heard what an intelligent woman she is  --  and what an excellent wife and mother  --  I have always been surprisedthat she permits her children to go to Bailey 's Beach . My wife would n't let our children be seen dead there . " " What is unwise about that ? " " I am surprised you ask , Mrs. Edom . The transatlantic sea lane and the Gulf Channel both pass a few miles from that point . Hundreds of ships in each direction go by all day and night . And by some unfortunate combination of land , tides , and currents the rubbish thrown overboard finds its way to Bailey 's Beach as to a magnet . Each morning the employees rake up baskets of trash : seamen 's boots , decaying fruit , dead parrots , picture postcards unsuitable for children , and other things too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I do not believe that to be true . " " It is very discourteous of you to say that , Mrs. Edom . In this club gentlemen do not call one another liars . " " I beg your pardon . I meant to say that I find that difficult to believe . " " Thank you . . . I have also heard that the lady about whom we are talking is careful about the diet furnished to her family and staff . Do you know my wife and I think that kale soup is one of the most nutritious  --  and delicious  --  dishes that exist . " ( Pause . ) " But a very experienced doctor advised us not to let children under twelve eat that highly spiced linguifa sausage that is cooked in it at the Portuguese market . . . . And beef and pork soaked in brine  --  excellent ! The British Navy served it to their seamen for centuriesand ruled the sea . The Battle of Trafalgar was said to have been won on corned beef . That same doctor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that salted meat is not to be recommendedfor young children , even after weeks of soaking in clear water . " " Does Brother Bellerophon  --  as you call him  --  come often to this club ? "  | " Not as often as we 'd like . I think I can say that he is the most beloved and admired member here . The club members , who are all very wealthy men , became aware that his family is less fortunately provided than themselves . They made him honorary member which requires no dues . Four of them , including myself , offered him high positions in their companies and enterprises . Brother Prudentius has offered him a vice-presidency in an insurance company in Hartford . Brother Candidus is developing residentareas in Florida . Brother Bellerophon 's name on the letterhead , his presence , his famous probity , would bring the firm millions of dollars which they would be glad to share with him . And so the rest of us . Brother Bellerophon is too deeply attached to his family ; his wife does not wish to move to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will change his mind and join my company from sheer necessity . " " What business are you engaged in , sir ? " " I 'd rather not say , Mrs. Edom . But considering his distinguished service to our country , the Federal Government would not be inclined to examine our operations too closely . " I lowered my voice . " Do you think I can hope that he will ? " " Brother Asmodius , I have no desire to continue this conversa-tion . " " A man must work . A man must stand up on his own feet , ma'am . " " I will pound on that door ! " " Oh , Mrs. Edom , do n't do that ! You would wake up the girls ! " " Girls ! What girls ? " " Naturally on the weekends there are some convivial times here . A little drinking . And some pleasant company from New Bedford and Fall River . The members return to their homes at a very late hour .

" " Madam , as a member of this club I must restrain you from creating an unseemly disorder . " I added bitingly , " I had always heard that Mrs. Edom conducted herself as a woman of distinction , which has not always been said of her mistress . " " What do you mean by that ? " I pointed to the clock . " You have only a quarter of an hour to wait . " " What did you mean by that unpleasant remark ? " " It was not an unpleasant remark . It was a tribute to yourself , Mrs. Edom . " " I am waiting " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall . .. give you a short explanation . " She sat down and glared at me , expectantly . I returned to polishingmy nails , but I began to speak offhandedly : " My dear wife does not engage in gossip . I have never heard her repeat a malicious remark  --  but once . By the way , we took the doctor 's advice . We no longer serve the children kale soup and beef in brine . " " You were about to tell me some remark about Mrs. Van-winkle . " " Oh , yes . " I lowered my voice and moved my chair toward hers . " There is a nickname that is going around about that otherwise wonderful woman . " " A nickname ! " " My wife heard it from Mrs. Delgarde who heard it from Lady Bracknell who heard it from Mrs. Venable herself . " " Mrs. Venable ! " I rose . " No ! I do n't circulate things like that . I 've changed my mind . " " You 're a very exasperating man , Brother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  | " All right , " I sighed , " but promise not to repeat it  --  least of all to Mrs. Vanwinkle . " " I will not repeat it . " " Well , Mrs. Venable heard that Mrs. Vanwinkle sent her husband  --  thatgreat man  --  to Mrs. Temple 's house to pick up a thirty-year-old egret feather , because she refused to believe Mrs. Temple 's promised word that she would destroy it herself . Mrs. Venable said , ' I shall not give another penny to those animal shelters until Mrs. Vanwinkle is locked up . She 's a Delilah ! ' " " Delilah ! " " You remember that Delilah cut short the mighty Samson 's hair whereby he lost his strength  --  so that his enemies could rush into his tent and blind him . She beat on cymbals and tambourines and danced on his prostrate body . Scholars of the Old Testament know very well that the story means that she performed a far more serious operation on him .

" When I returned from the kitchen , Rip had climbed out of the fiddlers ' gallery , descended the stairs , and was pounding on the locked door . I opened it . Husband and wife stared at one another in silence . She accepted the glass from my hand without taking her eyes off Rip . Finally she said , " Nicholas , will you ask this dreadful man to leave the room ? " " This is my German professor , Pam . I 'm driving him back to Newport in a few minutes . Ted , will you go upstairs and wait until I call you ? " " I 'll start walking into town , Rip . You can pick me up on the road . Good morning , ma'am . " And I went out the front door . As I passed the threshold I heard Mrs. Vanwinkle break into a convulsion of weeping.  |p140It  was a beautiful day . I walked for a quarter of an hour . Soon after I passed Tiverton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had lowered her veil but her head was held high . Not long after Rip stopped for me . I climbed into the car . " You were very tough , Ted . . . . You were very tough . " He started the car . After a few minutes he said , " You were very tough . " " I know I went too far , Rip , and I apologize . " We drove in silence for a while . Ten miles in silence . Then he said , " I told her you were an old joker way back in college days and that all that about Mrs. Venable was just horse-feathers . . . . But how the hell did you know about Mrs. Temple 's goddamned feather ? " " I wo n't tell . " He stopped the car and cracked my skull against his . " Oh , you 're an old son-of-a-bitch , Ted  --  but I got a thousand dollars to go to Berlin ! " " Well , you gave me a wonderful lunch at the Cafe de Paris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  |p141The  events that led to my obtaining an apartment occurred during my sixth week in Newport , perhaps later . I was living at the " Y , " contentedly enough ; my relations there were impersonal and left me time to prepare for my classes . I was on good terms with the superintendent  --  unjustly called " Holy Joe , " for he was not at all sanctimonious . From time to time , for a change , I would descend to the " library " where card games of the family type , like hearts and three jacks , were permitted and desultory conversation tolerated . It was in this library that I met a remarkable young man whose portrait and unhappy predicaments I find recorded in my Journal . Elbert Hughes was a reedy youth , barely twenty-five , belonging to that often wearisome category of human beings known as " sensitive . " This adjective once meant intensely aware of aesthetic and spiritual values ; then it took on a sense of someone quick to resent slights ; recently it has become a euphemism for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our daily practical life . Elbert chiefly fulfilled the third description . He wasp142short but delicately proportioned . His eyes were deeply set under a protruding forehead , lending an intensity to his gaze . His fingers were much occupied with a tentative mustache . He was something of a dandy and on cool evenings wore a black velveteen jacket and a flowing black tie , recalling the students I had seen near the Beaux-Arts Academy when I lived in Paris . Elbert gave me a partial account of his life and I presently discovered that he was a sort of genius  --  subdivision , calligraphic mimicry . He was a Bostonian and had followed courses in a technical high school there , devoting himself passionately to copperplate writing and to lettering , with a particular interest in tombstone inscriptions . By the age of twenty he had secured a profitable job at a leading jeweler 's establishment where he furnished the models for engravedinscriptions on presentation silver , for formal invitations and calling cards . For another firm he wrote diplomas on parchmentand honorary tributes to retiring bank presidents . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from standard " style books " or from admired early English and American " plate " in museums and private collections . But that was not all . He could copy any signature or individual penmanship after a moment 's profound " absorption " in a model before him . He could furnish a receipt in the hand of almost any signer of the Declaration of Independence at a moment 's notice . He was a wonder . It was not new to me that these " sensitives " are an unhappy mixture of humility and boldness . One evening he asked me to write a sentiment and to sign it . I wrote ( in French , of which he did not know a word ) a maxime of the Duc de la Rochefoucauld and signed it with my own name . He studied it gravely for a few minutes and then wrote : Mr. Theodore Theophilus North regrets that he will be unable to accept the kind invitation of the Governor of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and of Mrs. So-and-so for such-and-such an evening . " It was in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he wrote it again and passed it over to me , saying lightly , " That is how Edgar Allan Poe would havep143written it . I like to do his handwriting best . When I do his handwritingI feel him moving my hand . People say I look like him . Can you see that I look like him ? " " Yes . But I never heard that he was much of a draughtsman . " " We 're a lot alike though . We were both born in Boston ... . The thing I like to draw best is the lettering on tombstones . There 's a lot about graves and tombs in Poe 's writings . He 's my favorite writer that ever lived . " " What are you doing in Newport ? " I asked . " Much the same kind of work I did in Boston . A man named Forsythe saw some presentation copies I had made on vellum of a poem by Edgar A. Poe in Poe 's handwriting , and some alphabets I had drawn up in several styles . He said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Newport . He offered me a pretty good salary to come down here and work for him . I do lettering for the fronts of buildings  --  post offices , town halls , things like that . I do gravestones for masons too . I like that best . " I had been staring at our ( mine and Poe 's ) replies to the Governor . " I 'll show you something else , " he said . He extracted from a portfolio beside him a leaf of the Governor 's personal stationery  --  seal embossed  --  and wrote the invitation for which he had twice written the reply . " Is that the Governor 's own handwriting ? " " I 've done lots of work for both his office and his mansion . I 've worked for all the best stationers and I collect samples . I 've got a trunk full of the best stuff . There are collectors all over the world , you know  --  they keep it secret . I trade duplicates . " He laid before me : " The White House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pierpont Morgan , " " The Foreign Office , " Enrico Caruso 's cartoon of himself as a letterhead , a bookplate by Stanford White . . . . " Are you doing that kind of work for Forsythe here in New-port ? "  | " Not very much , " he answered , evasively , returning the " samples " to their portfolio . " We do something like it . " He changed the subject . Elbert Hughes might have been , should have been , good company , but he was n't . He suffered like many of his kind from alternationsof vitality and depletion . He would launch forth on a subject with enthusiasm only to fall silent in a short time like a deflated bellows . He was engaged to be married . Abigail was a wonderful woman ; she was ( he whispered ) divorced ; she was six years older than he was and had two children . He added , with abated enthusiasm , that he had saved up three thousand dollars to buy a house ( where they would presumably live gloomily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even liking Elbert , but I began losing interest in him ; I tend to avoid the disconsolate . I am indebted to him , however , for awakening my interest in an aspect of Newport that I had neglected . Elbert took to bringing down to our little library the work he was doing ; he said that the light was better than that provided in our rooms upstairs , as indeed it was . I would occasionally use the library for my own " homework , " when it was not also occupied by a conversational gathering . One evening I asked permission to see what he was engaged upon . He answered confusedly that it was just " some nonsense he was doing for fun . " It was a letter from the eminent historian George Bancroftinviting the equally eminent Louis Agassiz to an evening of " punch and good talk . " Elbert seemed to have given himself the enjoyment of writing Agassiz 's reply to this attractive invitation . " Where are the originals of these letters ? " I asked . " Mr. Forsythe has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buys them from the owners . " Entirely apart from Elbert 's " fun " with such documents , I was delighted with them . That was Newport 's Fifth City  --  the city that had disappeared leaving little trace behind it  --  the Newport of the mid-nineteenth-century intellectuals . My various jobs were nourishing my interest in the Second City , the Sixth City , and thep145Seventh City ; I was living in the Ninth City . In my early twenties I had fancied myself as an archaeologist . Here was a field for excavation . Dr. Schliemann had possessed a large private fortune ; I had not a dollar to spare . I reminded myself of an old saying I had read somewhere : " To the impassioned will nothing is im-possible . " There were still a few half-mornings and half-afternoons free in my schedule . I prepared myself by visiting the " People 's Library , " and " reading up " on the period . Then I visited the antiquariesand second-hand stores . I nursed the hope that I might come upon things that no one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  diaries , correspondences , job-lots of books and papers from old houses , family photograph albums , the emptyingsof attics . . . . The James family , the Agassiz families ( the great father and the great son ) , the Bancrofts , Longfellow . Longfellowspent his summers at Nahant , but he often visited his friend George Washington Greene at West Greenwich near Narragansett Bay and Greene 's parents who lived in Newport . Two of his bestknownpoems show his interest in our First City , " The Skeleton in Armor " and " The Jewish Cemetery at Newport . " The " antique shops " were still selling objects from the First and Second Cities . The vogue for taking a half-condescending pleasure in the furniture and decoration of the Victorian age was still twenty years in the future . Here and there I found collections of daguerreotypes , framed letters or poems signed by the notable men of the time ; but these had already been discovered and were beyond my means . I descended to the second-hand stores and received permission to climb ladders with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old dressers , the flotsam and jetsam of the years : here a clergyman 's wife had sold a lifetime of her husband 's sermons for rag paper , a thrifty merchant 's family their father 's account books , and so on . Almost at once I made a small discovery . It was a schoolgirl 's " memory book , " bound in coral velvet , moth-eaten , mouldy . Therep146were faded blue photographs of picnics and birthday parties , dance ' cards and autographs . On one page H. W. Longfellow had copied out " The Children 's Hour , " " for my dear young friend Faith Somerville . " With a show of casual interest I bought the book for two dollars ; the following autumn I sold it in New York for thirty . I found bundles of Somerville papers and bought them for forty cents a pound . My idea was that somehow I might penetrate that magic world ( my father used to call it " plain living and high thinking " ) and glimpse those enchanted late afternoons in Newport when professors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wickets and a voice called , " Come in , children , and wash your hands before supper . " I knew that any first edition of a work by Edgar Allan Poe was among the greatest prizes in all American book-collecting and that any letter from his pen was eagerly sought . Poe had paid an extensive visit to Providence , only thirty miles away ; but there was no record of his having visited Newport . If I could discover a bundle of Poe 's letters  --  what a lively interest for me and , later , what an addition to my capital savings ! ( No biographer had yet drawn up the wide spectrum of that boyhood 's ambitions : poet , detective , gentleman , actor perhaps like his mother , metaphysician " Eureka ! " , cryptographer , landscape gardener , interior decorator , tormented lover  --  too great and diverse a load for any American to carry . ) I found no Poe letters , but his name was brought to my attention repeatedly . One evening I found under my door a copy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a triumph of Elbert Hughes 's art . Meeting Hughes by chance in the hall I thanked him ; but I tore the counterfeit up . There was no night watchman prowling the corridors of the " Y , " but a night clerk , Maury Flynn , tended the front desk . Maury was a cheerless old man in poor health . Like many night attendants in hotels and clubs he was a retired policeman . One night toward three in the morning I was awakened by a knock at my door . It was Maury.  | " Ted , are you a partickler friend of Hughes in 32 ? " " I know him , Maury . What 's the matter ? " " Fellow in the next room says he 's been having nightmares . Groaning like . Falling out of bed . This fellow telephoned me . Would you go in and see if you could calm him down , sort of ? " I threw on a bathrobe and got into some slippers and went down to Room 32 . Maury had left the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the edge of his bed , his head bent over his knees . " Elbert ! Elbert ! What 's the matter ? " He raised his head , gazed at me vacantly , and resumed his former position . I shook him brusquely but he made no response . I looked about the room . On the center table lay an unfinished example of his accomplished art . It was the opening of " The Fall of the House of Usher . " On the bedside table stood a half-empty bottle of " Dr. Quimby 's Sleeping Syrup . " I sat down and watched him for a while , repeating his name in a low insistent voice . Then I went to the washstand , dipped a washrag in cold water , and applied it to his face , the nape of his neck , and to his wrists  --  as I used to do to drunken companions in Paris in 1921 . I now did this several times . At last he raised his head again and mumbled , " Hello , Ted . Nothing . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm going to walk you up and down the corridor a few times . Breathe , breathe deep . " He fell back on the bed and shut his eyes . More cold water . I slapped his face and struck his shoulder sharply . At last we were walking the corridor . We must have done a quarter of a mile . We returned to the room . " No ! You remain standing . Take some more deep breaths . . . . Tell me about your dreams . . . . Yes , you can hold on to the wall . " " Buried alive . Ca n't get out . Nobody can hear me . " " Do you take this syrup all the time ? " " Do n't sleep very good . Do n't want to sleep because ... they come . But I 've got to sleep , because when I do n't , I make mistakes in my work . They take it off my pay . "  | " Do you know Dr. Addison ? " " No . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's ' doctor . He 's in and out of the building all the time . I 'm going to send him to see you tomorrow night . Talk to him ; tell him everything . And do n't drink any more of this stuff . Will you give me permission to take this bottle away ? . . . And , Elbert , do n't read any more Edgar Allan Poe . He 's not right for you  --  all those crypts and vaults . Do you think you 'll be able to sleep calmly now ? . . . Do you want me to read aloud to you for ten minutes ? " " Yes , will you , Ted ? " " I 'm going to read to you in a language you do n't understand . All you have to know is that it 's serene and beautiful like the printing of the Elzevirs . " So I read him from Ariosto and he went off like a baby . I lost touch with Elbert for about ten days . Dr. Addison gave him some sleeping pills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been scarcely eating at all . I continued my search for the Fifth City . In another store  --  now down almost at the **26;139;TOOLONG  --  I had another stroke of luck : the rejected sketches of the elder Henry James 's commentary on a work of Swedenborg . They were resting in a barrel together with bundles of old letters to the family . I separated the letters from the theology and bought them for very little . I had first become interested in the writing Jameses while reading ( in my earliest phase ) , with mounting dissatisfaction , William James 's Varieties of Religious Experience ; more recently I had read a number of his brother 's novels . The James family lived in Newport throughout the Civil War . The two eldest sons had left to join the Army . William , Henry , and their sister Alice all had had nervous breakdowns in 186o and enlistment of those brothers was out of the question . The letters had little to tell me , but I felt I was on the trail . Within two weeks my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up those researches entirely . What little free time Ip149had was devoted to hunting for an apartment . This was limited to opportunities within my means  --  among the jerry-built workmen 's homes on the streets leading up the slope from the further reach of Thames Street . I rang every doorbell whether there was an advertisementof lodging or not . I had a clear idea of what I wanted : two rooms or one large room , a bath , a cooking facility however simple . I wanted the rooms to be on the second story , entered by an outside stairway so that ( yet not the only reason ) I would not be required to come and go through the landlord 's residence and family . I did not object to crying babies , boisterous children , a location above a kitchen , a sloping roof , proximity to a firehouse or to a convivial fraternal organization or to church bells . This requirementof a separate entrance was not as uncommon as might appear . These old houses were beginning to be subdivided into family apartments ; elderly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this run-down area . I was shown many apartments and derived considerable enjoyment from the encountersthis search involved . One morning I found my apartment . I had surveyed the premises and seen the exterior stairway . The mailbox said " Keefe . " The door was opened by a thin distrustful woman in her middle fifties . Her face was lined but retained the high coloring characteristic of those living by a northern sea . I learned later that on the death of her husband over twenty years ago she had opened a rooming house and raised two sturdy sons to become merchant seamen . In spite of many disappointments she had never been able to free herself of the idea that a rooming house should have the character of a home . She was distrustful but eager to trust . " Good morning , Mrs. Keefe . Have you an apartment to let ? " She paused a moment . " I have and I have n't . How long would you want it ? " " All summer , ma'am , if it suited me . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? "  | " I 'm a tennis instructor at the Casino . My name is Theodore North . " " Do you attend any church regularly ? " " I 've only been a short time in Newport . During the War I was stationed at Fort Adams . I used to walk into town to attend the evening service at Emmanuel Church . " " Come in and sit down . Excuse my dress ; it 's early and I 'm housecleaning . " She led me into a sitting room that should have been preserved in a museum for generations yet unborn . " What exactly were you looking for , Mr. North ? " " One large room or two small ones ; a bath and some simple kitchen facility ; some housecleaning and a change of linen once a week . And I 'd like it to be on the second floor with an exterior stairway . " She had been looking me up and down . " How much would you be willing to pay , Mr. North ? " " I was thinking of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and examined the floor in silence . I remained silent too . With each of us every penny counted ; but she had a weightier anxiety on her mind . " It is occupied at present , but I have told the men there that they must be prepared to give it up on two weeks ' notice . They agreed to that . " " You do n't find them satisfactory , Mrs. Keefe ? " " I do n't know what to think . They do n't sleep there . They had me take the beds away . They used it like it was a business office . They brought in a big table to work on . They say they 're architects , working on some problem , some prize-contest they want to win . Like a plan for a perfect town , something like that . " " Do they give you any trouble ? " " I do n't see them or hear them for a week at a time , except sometimes when they come and go up their back stairs . I never see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rent . They keep the doors locked all day and night . They do their own clean/ing up . Never any letters ; never any telephone calls . Mr. North , they 're like ghosts in the house . Never say good morning ; never exchange the time of day . I do n't call that roomers . " She was looking at me with a first sign of confidence , even of appeal . " Did they give any kind of reference in town when they came ? Any other address ? " . " The oldest one , I guess he 's the head of ' em , gave me the number of his postbox at the Post Office  --  Number 308 . One Sundaynoon I saw them all eating at the Thames Street Blue Star Restaurant . " " Have you taken other people up to inspect the apartment ? " " Yes , two married couples . They did n't like it  --  no beds , hardly any chairs . I guess it did n't look like an apartment to them . Besides , there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it 's getting all through the house . Some chemical they use . " " Mrs. Keefe , I think you have reason to be worried . " " How do you mean ? " " I do n't know yet . Can you take me up there now ? " " Yes . . . Yes , I 'd like to . " That amazing detective Chief Inspector Theophilus North had sprung to life again . I followed her up the stairs and when she had knocked loudly at the door I gestured to her , smiling , to stand at one side . I put my ear to the crack in the door . I heard a muffled oath , whispered commands , rapid motions , a falling object . Finally the door was unlocked and a tall man with a southern colonel 's mustache and goatee , very angry , faced us . He was wearing a white linen coat that I associate with surgeons . " I 'm sorry to disturb you , Mr. Forsythe , but there 's a gentleman here who 'd like to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to arrange these interruptions at the noon hour , Mrs. Keefe . " " My visitors have to make these calls at their own time . Theyp152visit five and six apartments every morning . I 'm sorry ; that 's the way it is . " It was a large room filled with the sunlight that I would seldom be able to enjoy  --  seeming all the larger because of the sparseness of the furniture . A long trestle-like table ran the length of the room . On one end of it rested what I think would be called a " mock-up " of an ideal village in miniature , a delightful piece of work . The four men stood against the wall as though they were undergoing a military inspection . To my great surprise the youngest of the men was Elbert Hughes . He was as astonished as I was , and extremely frightened . In my role as detective I knew that it was my task to appear as unsuspicious as possible . I strolled over to Elbert and shook his hand . " Good morning , Hughes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like this . We 'll get you out on the tennis courts yet . " I gave him a blow on the shoulder . " You look kind of thin and peaked to me , Hughes . Tennis , man , that 's what you need !  --  What ! Making children 's toys ? Awfully pretty village that . Excuse me , gentlemen , while I see if there 'd be room in these cupboards for my collection of tennis cups . " There was a row of china cupboards , faced with glass and lined with silk . I grasped at their handles , but they were locked . " Locked ?  --  Well , do n't take the trouble to unlock them now . " I strolled into the bathroom and kitchen . " Just right for me , " I said to Mrs. Keefe . " Funny smell , though . I also have a collection of rocks  --  an old hobby of mine , semiprecious stones . I 'd like a good deal of cupboard space for them , too . " Returning into the main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unlike an architect 's atelier as possible . There were no wastepaper baskets ! It was as neat and uncluttered as a business office in a department store window  --  except for one thing : across the open windows were strung sheets of paper , delicately fastened together ; they were damp and had been hung out to dry . They had been dyed the color of blond tobacco . I smiled to Mr. Forsythe and said , " Laundry day , eh ? "  | " Mrs. Keefe , " he said , " I think the gentleman has had time enough to inspect the apartment . We must get back to our work . " I assumed that the making of counterfeit money and the engravers ' and etchers ' art would require a bulky press and pots of blue and green ink , but nothing of the kind was to be seen . The sheets of paper in the window were certainly being " aged . " But I was getting " hot . " " There are some more cupboards for my collections up in that corner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with locks . I could hardly reach their handles , but I made two jumps for them . They swung open . To break my fall I clutched at the stacks of paper they contained , bringing down cascades of leaves that covered the floor  --  yes , " Thick as autumnal leaves that strew the brooks in Vallombrosa . " All four men rushed forward to pick them up , but not before I saw that they were copies in a delicate old-fashioned calligraphy of " The Battle Hymn of the Republic , " signed by Julia Ward Howe , once resident in Newport . As I lay flat on the floor over them I could see that each was inscribed to a different recipient  --  " For my dear friend ... , " " For the Honorable Judge So-andso ... " I showed no sign of finding anything remarkable . " Gee , gentlemen , I 'm sorry about this , " I said , picking myself up . " I hope I have n't sprained my ankle !  --  I 'm ready to go now , Mrs. Keefe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " As I started limping out of the door , Mr. Forsythe said , " Mrs. Keefe , I hope you 'll allow us to retain the rooms until the end of August without interruptions . I was about to propose an arrangement of this matter . " " We 'll talk that over at another time , Mr. Forsythe . Now I 'll leave you to your work . " At the bottom of the stairs I asked , " Can we talk somewhere else  --  in the kitchen , maybe ? " She nodded and started down the corridor . I turned back and opened the front door , saying loudly : " I 'm sorry , Mrs. Keefe , I rant consider it . It would take weeks to get rid of that unpleasantp154odor . Thank you for your trouble . Good morning , Mrs. Keefe ! " I then slammed the front door loudly and followed her on tiptoe to the kitchen . She watched me open-eyed . " You think they 're undesirable roomers , Mr. North ? " " They 're forgers . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They do n't make counterfeit money . They make antiques . " " Forgers ! I 've never had them before . Oh , Mr. North , the father of the Chief of Police was a good friend of my husband 's . Should n't I go to him ? " " I would n't make a big thing of it . They 're not harming anybody . Even if they sold a hundred fake letters of George Washingtononly fools would buy them . " " I do n't want them in the house . Forgers ! What should I do , Mr. North ? " " When is their month up ? " " Like I said , they 've agreed to go any time on two weeks ' notice . " " You should n't let them suspect that you know what they 're doing . They 're ugly customers . Let everything go on for a few days just as usual . I 'll think of something . " " Oh , Mr. North , help me get them out . They pay thirty dollars a month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll put the beds back and some nice furniture . " Suddenly she burst out , " My sister said I should have gone back to Providence when my husband died . She said I would n't be happy here . There 's an element in this town , she said , that 's riff-raff and that attracts riff-raff , and I 've seen it over and over again . " I knew her answer , but I asked , " You mean the other side of Thames Street ? " " No ! No ! " She tossed her head toward the north . " I mean up there : Bellevue Avenue . No fear of God . Filthy money , that 's what I mean ! " I comforted her as best I could and drove off on my bicycle top155a hard day 's schedule , whistling . I 'd found my apartment and I 'd heard the voice of the Ninth City . At about nine that evening as I sat brushing up my New TestamentGreek for one of my students there was a knock at my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wore the look of the unhappiest man in the world . " What can I do for you , Elbert ? Nightmares again ? . . . Well , what is it ? Sit down . " He sat down and burst into tears . I waited . " For God 's sake , stop crying and tell me what 's the matter . " Sobbing he said , " You know . You saw it all . " " What do I know ? " " They said if I told anyone , they 'd crush my hand . " He extendedhis right hand . " Elbert ! Elbert ! How did a decent American boy like you get mixed up with a gang like that ? . . . What would your mother think , if she knew what you were doing ? " It was a shot in the dark , but it went home . Heavy precipitation . I got up and opened the door : " Stop crying or leave this room ! " " I 'll ... I 'll tell you . " " Take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water at the washstand and begin at the beginning . " When he 'd pulled himself together , he began , " I told you how Mr. Forsythe offered me the job to work for him . Then I found out it was n't lettering they wanted , but . . . that other thing . They 'd bought a lot of first and second editions of Hiawatha and Evangeline and made me inscribe them to the writer 's friends . At first I thought it was a kind of stunt . Then I copied the poems and did the same thing . And short letters by a lot of people . He keeps thinking up new things , like Edgar Allan Poe . Lots of people collect the signatures of the Presidents of the United States : " " Where do they sell these ? "  | " They do n't talk much about it in front of me . By mail , mostly . They have a stamp that says John Forsythe , Dealer in Historical Documents and Autographs . ' They get a lot of letters every day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months he had been working at this , eight hours a day , five and a half days a week . The men wanted him under their eyes every day and night . They lived in a commercial hotel on Washington Square . He was not a man of strong will , but Elbert had won a small battle ; he had insisted on living at the Y.M.C.A. They surrounded him as in a cocoon . He could n't go out for a meal or to a lecture without one or other of them in amiable attendance . When he announced that he was going to Boston for a weekend to see his mother and his fiancee , Mr. Forsythe said , " We 're all taking a vacation in September . " He pulled from his pocket the lengthy contract that Elbert had signed in which he agreed to a " continuous residence in Newport , Rhode Island . " Mr. Forsythe added , kindly , that if Elbert broke that contract he could be sued in court for all the salary that had been paid him . " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a job . " I had long noticed that one or other of the team spent a large part of the evening in the lobby of the " Y " reading or playing checkers and watching the stairs . No wonder that he dreamed of being buried alive , of walls closing in . " What does the curly-haired one do ? " " He makes the watermarks , and ages the paper . He makes stains on the paper and sometimes he makes burns on it . " " And the other one ? " " He frames the writing and puts glass over them . Then he takes the boxes to the Post Office . " " I see . . . . What 's this about smashing your hand ? " " Well , he said it just as a joke , of course . One day I said that I was really interested in lettering  --  and that 's what they hired me for  --  and that I wanted to go down to Washington , D.C. , forp157two weeks to study the lettering on the public buildings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He said he wanted me right here . He said , ' You would n't want anything to happen to your right hand , would you ? ' and he pushed my fingers way back , like this . . . . He said it with a smile , but I did n't like it . " " I see .... Do you want to break away from them , Elbert ? " " Oh , Ted , I wish I 'd never seen them . Help me ! Help me ! " I looked at him for a few minutes . Damn it , I was caught . I was caught in a trap . It looked as though I were the sole person responsible for the welfare of this helpless incapable half-genius . If we called in the police , these men , sooner or later , would retaliate on Elbert or on me , or on Mrs. Keefe , or on all three of us . I had a busy schedule ; I could not drop what I was doing to extricate this unhappy maladept from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's lap  --  and I had an idea . " Now , Elbert , things are going to change for you . You go back to work just as usual  --  and continue working so for a few days . Do n't you give any sign that there 's going to be a change or you 'll ruin the whole plan . " " I wo n't . I wo n't . " " Now you go back to your room and go to sleep . Did Dr. Addison give you something to help you about that ? Are you getting some sound sleep ? " " Yes , " he said , unconvincingly . " He gave me some pills . " " Now you 've got all wrought up . I ca n't read to you tonight . Take one of Dr. Addison 's pills , and what have you got to think about to calm you down ? " He looked up at me with a confidential smile . " I think about designing a good gravestone for Edgar Allan Poe . " " No ! No ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you  --  freedom , your marriage , Abigail . Get a good rest now . Good night . " " Good night , Ted . "  |p158There  was a telephone at the end of the corridor . I called up Dr. Addison . " Doc , this is Ted North . Can I drop in and see you in about ten minutes ? " " Sure ! Sure ! Always ready for a little prayer-meeting . " As I have said the " Y " had its own doctor , Winthrop Addison , M.D. , a tall trunk of walnut , over seventy . His professional notice was still attached to the post of his verandah , but he told all strangers that he had retired ; no patient he had ever served , however , was turned away . He cut his own hair , cooked his own meals , tended his own garden , and , as the ranks of his former patients were thinning , he had plenty of free time . He liked to linger in the front room of our building and talk with any resident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company and was assembling a portrait of him for my Journal . He had a fund of stories not always suitable for his younger listeners . I ran down to Thames Street and bought a flask of the best , then came back up our street and rang his doorbell . " Come in , professor . What is it now ? " I offered my present to him . As he knew I did n't drink hard liquor , he put the bottle to his lips murmuring , " Heaven , sheer Heaven ! " " Now , Doc , I 've got a problem . You 're under the oath of Hippocratesnot to say a word about it for six months . " " Agreed , lad . Agreed ! I can clean you up in two months . I should have warned you about going to ' Hattie 's Hammock . ' " " I do n't need a doctor . Listen : I need smart , experienced grade-A advice . " " I 'm listening . " " What did you think of Elbert Hughes ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs backbone . Maybe he needs a mother . He 's got some load of misery . He wo n't talk . " I told him about the forgery ring , about Elbert 's extraordinary gift ; about his condition of slavery . Doc loved it and took a deep swig . " Elbert wants to get away from them without their suspect/ing that he 'll talk to the police or to anyone . They 're very ugly types , Doc . They 've already threatened to maim him , to smash his right hand . Could you give him some disease that would put him to bed for six weeks ? That would put them out of business and they 'd leave town . He 's all they 've got . He 's their pot of gold . " Doc laughed long and loud . " That reminds me of a case that I had twenty-five years ago  --  " " Save it ! Save it ! " " This man 's wife had hives  --  cruel ! What I call thistle-patch hives . ' He told me he wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . She said she could n't sleep a wink without his being by her side . " " Doc , save it . Please save it . I want the whole story another time . Remember we 're writing a book together . " ( It was to be called Coughing Up the Diamonds : The Memoirs of a Newport Doctor ; the best of it is in my Journal . ) " Get your mind back to Elbert Hughes . What 's that disease that makes your hand tremble ? Or could you sort of make out that he 's blind for a while ? " Dr. Addison held up his hand to stop me . He was deep in t bought . " I 've got it ! " he cried . " I knew you 'd think of something , Doc . " " Last month Bill Hinkle was doing his laundry down in the basement . He got his hand caught in the mangle  --  get the picture ? His hand came out as flat as a playing card . Well , I pushed the knuckles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be playing poker by Christmas . I 'll give Elbert a plaster cast as big as a wasps ' nest . " " You 're a wonder , Doc . Now you 've got to say ' No Visitors Admitted ' because those gangsters will want to call on him . They 're so furious they 'll tear off the plaster cast and wreck his hand . He 's fouled up their game . They 'd follow him to China . Doc , could you write a letter to ' Holy Joe ' to make sure that no visitors could be admitted to his room ? "  | " When do you want me to put the cast on ? " " Today 's Tuesday . I want him to go to work a few days as usual . Say Saturday morning . Doc , does your daughter like poetry ? " " She writes it  --  hymns mostly . " " I 'll see she gets a copy of ' A Psalm of Life , ' framed in glass , practically signed by the author . " " She 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! And the grave is not its goal . ' Eyewash , but talented . " Here he fell into deep thought again . " Wait a minute ! Holy Joe 's ' not got spunk enough to prevent gangsters moving about his house . Elbert 's not safe there . " " Oh , Doc , if you could hide him in your house . Elbert 's saved up a lot of money . He could pay for a husky male nurse to watch him when you were out . " " Out or in , I 'm too old to rassle with thugs . I might kill one of them , unintentional . Hide him in New Hampshire or Vermont . " " You do n't know Elbert yet . He ca n't cope with anything except the alphabet . He 'd get in touch with his mother and his fiancee and these fellows know their addresses . Somebody 's got to do his thinking for him . He 's not all there . He 's a genius ; he 's a little bit crazy . He thinks he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've got it . We 'll give out that he 's crazy . A friend of mine has a mental hospital twenty miles away that 's as hard to get into as a Turkish harem . " " Would n't that be complicated ? Could n't you think of a simpler idea ? " " Hell ! You 're only young once . Let 's make it as complicated as possible . Saturday morning we kidnap him . We 'll call it brain fever . " " That 's great , Doc . I knew I 'd come to the right place . Now we 've got Elbert out of the way of mayhem . But we have another problem and I want your ideas . Take a swig ; you 'll need inspiration  --  realinspiration . We want them out of town quick . We do n't want to call in the police . We want to scare them out . "  | " I 've got it , " said Doc . " The only way these men can be charged and indicted is by the Post Office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No wonder they do n't get letters or telephone calls at Mrs. Keefe 's . They had to give a local address to rent that post office box . So they probably gave the Union Hotel on Washington Square , where they 're staying . This Forsythe is n't there at any time during the working day , is he ? Well , tomorrow morning I 'm going to drop in there and ask in a heavy manner for Mr. Forsythe . Not in . ' Tell him a representative of the United States Post Office Department called on him and will call again . ' " " Would n't the hotel know you , Doc ? " " I have n't answered a call from that hotel for twenty years . Then you find time in the afternoon before five to do the same thing . Then I 'll ask a patient of mine to do the same thing  --  a retired gardener , solemn as a judge . That 'll get them rattled .

Let me read you a letter from the Governor of Massachusettsthat I 've got ready for Elbert to forge on the Governor 's own stationery . Take a swig . ' Mr. John Forsythe , Dealer in HistoricalDocuments and Autographs , Newport , Rhode Island . Dear Mr. Forsythe , As you may know , my office in The State House is hung with portraits of worthies in our history . Those belong to the Commonwealth . I have a smaller reception room , however , on whose walls I have hung autographed letters from my own collection . A mimeographed sheet of your very interesting offers for the autumn of 1926 has just been brought to my attention by a friend who found it in a hotel room in Tulsa , Oklahoma . There are some lacunae in my collection that I would like to fill , particularly letters from Thoreau , Margaret Fuller , and Louisa May Alcott . In additionI would like to replace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lowell , and Bowditch  --  with letters of more significantp162content . Would you kindly send me the address of your office or showroom in Newport , so that I may send an expert to report to me about the properties you have in stock . This is an unofficial letter and I request that you regard it as confidential . Faithfully yours , " et cetera , et cetera . " That 'll smoke ' em out . " " I 'll wake Elbert at six o'clock tomorrow morning so that he can copy it out before he goes to work . How 'll I get it mailed in Boston ? " " My daughter 'll mail it . Leave it at my door as soon as it 's finished . Tomorrow 's Wednesday ; they 'll get it Friday morning . Elbert must be out of the way before they read it . " " Anything else occur to you , Doc ? " " Yes . Do you think Elbert can afford to pay about thirty dollars for his rescue ? " " Sure of it . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down in front of Mrs. Keefe 's house . He needs the money and he 'll love the work . He 's a former actor . When that messenger of theirs goes to the P.O. carrying all those boxes Nick will follow him and stick his nose into everything this fella does . Then he goes back to Mrs. Keefe 's house and when the forgers quit work , he 'll give them the Hawkshaweye and they 'll see him writing all their comings and goings in a notebook  --  see what I mean ? " " Beautiful ! " " You telephone Mrs. Keefe that he 's out there protecting her . They 'll order a van and get out of there Saturday morning or I 'm a Chinaman . Tell Mrs. Keefe to telephone me the minute they announce they 're leaving and I 'll go down and sit in the hall to see that they do n't do any damage . Nick and I could take turns sitting up all night , if need be . " And that 's the way it happened . I moved in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  |p163My  favorite among the pupils in the early morning tennis classes at the Casino was Eloise Fenwick . She was fourteen  --  that is , as the spirit moved her  --  of any age between ten and sixteen . Some days when I approached the courts she seized my left elbow with both hands and required me to drag her to the back line ; some days she preceded me , the only female world 's champion who was also a lady , Countess of Aquidneck and the Adjacent Isles . In addition , she was intelligent with breathtaking surprises ; she was deep and kept her counsel ; she was as beautiful as the morning and showed no sign that she was aware of it . At first we had few opportunities for desultory conversation , but we were acknowledgedfriends without that . Friendship between one of Shakespeare'sheroines at the age of fourteen and a man of thirty is one of life 's fairest gifts , only occasionally available to parents . Eloise bore a burden on her shoulders . One day she said , " I wish my brother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She surreptitiously indicated a young man who was practicing his tennis shots against a wall reservedp164for such exercise at the farthest end of the courts . I had observed him for some time . He was , I assumed , about sixteen ; he was always alone . There was something defensively arrogant about him . His face was covered with the pimples and discolorations usually associated with late puberty . " Tennis lessons , Eloise ? Mr. Dobbs teaches students of that age . " " He does n't like Mr. Dobbs . And he would n't take lessons from you because you teach children . He does n't like anybody . No  --  I just wish you would teach him something . " " Well , I ca n't until I 'm asked , can I ? " " Mama 's going to ask you . " I glanced down at her . The tone of her voice and the carriage of her head said as plain as words that she , Eloise , had arranged it as she probably arranged many things that came to her notice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Eloise said , " Mama wants to talk to you about Charles . " Her eyes indicated a lady sitting in the spectators ' gallery . I had already remarked Charles back at the practice board . I followed Eloise who introducedme to her mother and withdrew . She was indeed Eloise 's mother . She had come to take her children home after their strenuous exercise and was heavily veiled for motoring . She put out her hand . " Mr. North , may I speak with you for a few moments ? Please sit down . Your name is well known in our house and in the houses of a number of my friends with whom you read . Eloise admires you very much . " I smiled and said , " I had not dared to hope so . " She laughed softly and our reciprocal confidence was sealed . " I wanted to talk to you about my son Charles . Eloise tells me that you know him by sight . I was hoping that you could find time to coach him in French . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She mentioned a highly esteemed school for Roman Catholic students in the vicinity of Newport . " He has lived in France and speaks the language , after a fashion , but he needs top165apply himself to the grammatical constructions . He has a bloc against learning the genders of nouns and the tenses of verbs . He admires everything that is French and I have the impression that Ile really wishes to bring it up to a higher standard . " She lowered her voice slightly . " It embarrasses him that Eloise speaks much more correctly than he does . " i paused a moment . " Mrs. Fenwick , for four years and three summers I have taught French to students most of whom would prefer to do anything else . It is like dragging loads of stones uphill . During this summer I resolved not to work so hard . I have already rejected a number of students who are required to improvetheir French , German , and Latin . I must have the student 's own expression of readiness to study French and to work on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short talk with your son and hear him make such a commitment . " She lowered her eyes a moment , then rested them on her son in the distance . She finally said , sadly but directly : " That is a good deal to ask of Charles Fenwick .... I find it difficult to say what I must . I 'm not a bashful woman , I 'm not a bashful-minded woman at all , but I find it very hard to describe certain tendenciesor traits  --  in Charles . " Perhaps I can help you , Mrs. Fenwick . In the school where I 've been teaching the Headmaster has got into the way of calling my attention to any boys who do n't fit into the pattern of the ' All-American Boy ' he wants in the school  --  boys who seem to have what he calls problems . ' My telephone will ring : North , I want you to have some talk with Frederick Powell ; his housemaster says that he 's been walking and groaning in his sleep . He 's in 3'our parish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who are so homesick that they cry all night and ca n't hold down their food ; a boy who seemed to be preparing to hang himself because he failed in two subjects and foresaw that his father would not address a word to him throughout the whole Easter vacation and so on . " Thank you , Mr. North . . . I wish you had room in your parishp166for Charles . He has none of those problems . Perhaps he has a worse one : he has a disdain , almost a contempt , for everyone he has come into contact with , except perhaps Eloise , and several priests whom he has come to know in his religious duties .... He is far closer to Eloise than to his parents . " " What are the grounds for Charles 's low opinion of the rest of us ? " " Some posture of superiority . . . I have found the courage to give it a name : he is a snob , an unbounded snob . He has never said Thank you ' to a servant , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has thanked his father or myself when we have taken some pains to please him , the thanks are barely audible . At mealtimes when the family is alone ( for he refuses to come downstairs when there are guests ) he sits in silence . He takes no interest in any subject but one : our social standing . Neither his father nor I care one iota about that . We have our friends and enjoy them  --  here and in Baltimore . Charles is intensely anxious as to whether we are invited to what he regards as important occasions ; whether the clubs his father belongs to are the best clubs ; whether I am what the papers call a ' social leader . ' He is driving his father mad with questions about whether we have more means than the Soand-sos . Charles has a low opinion of us because we do n't stretch every nerve to  --  oh , I ca n't go on with this  --  " She was blushing intensely under her veils . She put her hands to her cheeks . I said quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mrs. Fenwick . " " As I said we are Roman Catholics . Charles is serious about his religious life . Father Walsh , who is in our home quite often , is fond of Charles and pleased with him . I have talked over with him this . . . this preposterous worldliness . He does not see it as of much importance ; he thinks Charles will outgrow it soon . " " Will you tell me something of Charles 's education ? " " Oh !  --  At the age of nine Charles developed a form of heart trouble . Baltimore and Johns Hopkins Medical School is a centerp167for many distinguished doctors . They treated him and cured him ; they tell me he is completely well . But at that time we took him out of school and ever since his education has been entirely in the hands of private tutors . " " Does that explain why he has so few friends , why he seems to be always alone ? " " Somewhat  --  but there is always his disdainful manner too . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are coarse and vulgar . " " Do the blemishes in his complexion have a part in this self-isolation ? " " That condition has only developed in the last ten months . He has been under treatment by the best dermatologists . His attitude to us is of long standing . " I smiled at her . " Do you think he can be persuaded to come over here and talk to me ? " " Eloise can persuade him to do anything . You can imagine our gratitude to God that that little girl of fourteen is so helpful and so wise . " " Then I will go inside and cancel my next appointment . Please ask Eloise to persuade him to come to this table and talk with me . Could you and Eloise leave us alone together for half an hour on some pretext ? " " Yes , we have shopping to do . " She beckoned to Eloise and told her of this plan . Eloise and I exchanged a glance fraught with meaning and I went off to telephone . When I returned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; he had turned it about so that only his profile was presented to me . In the school I had attended and the school where I had taught students rose when a master entered the room . Charles , without a glance at me , merely lowered his head in acknowledgment of my presence . He had good features , but the cheek he presented to me was marred by a number of cones and craters . I sat down . There was no possibility of his shaking hands with the lowest menial at the Newport Casino . " Mr. Fenwick  --  I shall call you that at the beginning of ourp168conversation , then I shall call you Charles  --  Eloise tells me that you have spent much time in France and have had several years of tutoring . Probably all you need is a few weeks putting some polish on the irregular verbs . Eloise certainly surprised me . She could get an invitation tomorrow to one of those chateaux for a weekend and pass the test with flying colors . As you probably know , French people of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who speak their language incorrectly . They think we 're savages . In a few moments I am going to ask you if you would like to work with me on this matter , but first I think we should know each other a little better . Eloise and your mother have told me a number of things about you : are n't there some questions you 'd like to put to me about myself ? " Silence . I held the silence so long that presently he spoke . His manner was offhand and freighted with condescension . " Did you go to Yale . . . is it true that you went to Yale ? " " Yes . " Same prolonged pause . " If you went to Yale , why are you working at the Casino ? " " To make some money . " " You do n't look . . . poor . " I laughed . " Oh , yes , I 'm very poor , Charles  --  but cheerful . " " Did you belong to any of those fraternities . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a member of the Alpha Delta Phi fraternity and of the Elizabethan Club . I was not a member of any one of the Senior Societies . " For the first time he glanced at me . " Did you try to get into one ? " " Trying has nothing to do with it . They did not invite me . " Another glance . " Did you feel very badly about it ? " " Maybe they were wise not to take me in . Maybe I would n't have suited them at all . Clubs are meant for men who have a lot in common . What kind of clubs would you like to be a member of , Charles ? " Silence . " The best clubs are built around hobbies.  |p169For  instance there 's a club in your own town Baltimore  --  a hundred years old that I think must be the most delightful inthe world and the hardest to get into . " " What club is that ? " " It 's called the Catgut Club . ' " He could n't believe his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a close affinity between medicineand music . In Berlin there 's a symphony orchestra made up of physicians alone . Around your Johns Hopkins Medical School there are more great doctors than in any place of its size in the world . Only the most eminent professors belong to the Catgut , ' but they 're also pianists , violinists , violists , cellists , and possibly a clarinetist . Every Tuesday night they sit down and play chamber music . " " What ? " " Chamber music . Do you know what that is ? " A strange thing was happening . Charles 's face already a mottled red and white had turned scarlet . He was blushing furiously . Suddenly I remembered  --  with a bang  --  that to very young Americans the word " chamber , " through association with chamber pots , was invested with the horror and excitement and ecstasy of the " forbidden "  --  of things not said openly ; and every " forbidden " word belongs to a network of words far more devastatingthan " chamber . " Charles Fenwick at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outgrown by the age of twelve . Of course ! He had had tutors all his life ; he had little association with boys of his own age who " aerate " that suppressed matter in giggles and whispers and horseplay and shouting . In one area of his development he was " arrested . " I explained what chamber music was and then I laid another trap for him to see if my conjecture was right . " There 's another club , also very select , at Saratoga Springs , whose members own racehorses and bet on races , but seldom ride them . There 's an old joke about them ; some people call it the ' Horses and Asses Club '  --  the members do n't sit on their horses , they sit on their asses . "  |p170It  worked . The crimson flag went up . At chapel services in the school where I had taught , the Bible readings occasionally reminded us that Abraham or Saul or Job had lost a large number of asses . The air in the auditorium would become tense ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be agonies of suppressedlaughter , convulsion , and desperate coughing . I went on serenely . " Which club would you rather belong to ? " " What ? " " The Baltimore doctors would n't give a pin to get into the millionaires ' club at Saratoga Springs and the horse-owners would n't be caught dead listening to a lot of chamber music ... . But I 'm wasting your time . Are you ready to say that you 'd be willing to work with me on the finer points of the French language ? Be perfectly frank , Charles . " He swallowed and said , " Yes , sir . " " Fine ! When next you 're in France you and Eloise may be asked to some noble 's country house for a pleasant weekend and you 'll want to feel secure about the conversation and all that ... . I 'll sit here and wait until your mother returns . I do n't want to interrupt your practice any longer . " I put out my hand ; he shook it and rose . I grinned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Springs where it might cause any embarrassment ; it 's all right just among men . " And I nodded in dismissal . Mrs. Fenwick returned followed by Eloise . " Charles feels that he 'd like to try a little coaching , Mrs. Fenwick . " " Oh , I 'm so relieved ! " " I think Eloise had a large part in it . " " Can I come to the classes , too ? " " Eloise , your French is quite good enough . Charles would n't open his mouth if you were there . But you can be sure that I 'll miss you . Now I want to discuss some details with your mother . " Eloise sighed and drifted off . " Mrs. Fenwick , have you ten minutes ? I want to lay a plan before you . "  | " Oh , yes , Mr. North . " " Ma'am , are you fond of music ? " " As a girl I seriously hoped to become a concert pianist . " " Who are your favorite composers ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but for some time I have become fonder and fonder of Mozart . Why do you ask ? " " Because a little-known aspect of Mozart 's life may help you to understand what is making life difficult for Charles . " " Charles and Mozart . " " Both suffered from an unfortunate deprivation in their adolescence . " " Mr. North , are you in your senses ? " ( I must now interrupt this account for a brief declaration . The reader has not failed to notice that I , Theophilus , did not hesitate to invent fabulous information for my own amusement or for the convenience of others . I am not given to telling either lies or the truth to another 's disadvantage . The passage that follows concerningMozart 's letters is the easily verifiable truth . ) " Ma'am , half an hour ago you assured me that you were not a bashful-minded woman . What I am about to say requires my discussing what many people would regard as vulgar and even distasteful matters . Of course , you may draw this conversation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think it will throw some light on why Charles is a closed-in and unhappy young man . " She stared at me in silence for a moment , then clutched the arms of her chair and said , " Go on . " " Readers of Mozart 's letters have long known of a few that he addressed to a cousin living in Augsburg . Those that have been published contain many asterisks indicating that deletions have been made . No editor or biographer would print the whole , feelingthat they would distress the reader and leave a stain on the image of the composer . These letters to his Basle  --  a German and Austrian diminutive for a female cousin  --  are one long chain of childish indecencies . Not long ago the famous author Stefan Zweig bought them and printed them , with a preface , for private dis/tribution among his friends . I have not seen the brochure , but a musicologist I know , living in Princeton , gave me a detailed account of them and of Stefan Zweig 's introduction . They are what is called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As I was told , there is little or no allusion to sexual matters ; it is all bathroom humor . ' They were written in the composer 's middle and late teens . How can one explain that Mozart who matured so early could descend to such infantile jokes ? The beautiful letters to his father , preparing him for the news of his mother 's death in Paris , were written not long after . Herr Zweig points out that Mozart never had a normal boyhood . Before he was ten he was composing and performing music all day and far into the night . His father was exhibiting him about Europe as a wonderchild . You remember that he climbed on Queen Marie Antoinette 's lap . I have not only been a teacher at a boys ' school , I have earned my living during the summers as counselor at camps and have had to sleep in the same tent with seven to ten urchins . Boys pass through a phase when all these forbidden ' matters obsess them  --  are excruciatingly funny and exciting and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given to giggling , but I assure you boys between nine and twelve will giggle for an entire half hour if some little physiologicalaccident takes place . They give vent to the anxiety surrounding the tabu by sharing it in the herd . But Mozart  --  if I may put it figuratively never played baseball in a corner lot , never went swimming on a boy scout picnic . " I paused . " Your son Charles was cut off from his contemporaries and all this perfectly natural childish adjustment to our bodily nature was driven underground ; and has festered . " She addressed me coldly , " My son Charles has never uttered a vulgar word . " " Mrs. Fenwick , that 's the point ! " " How do you know that something is festering ? " There was a sneer in her voice . She was a very nice woman , but she was being hard pushed.  | " By sheer accident . In our conversation he gave me pretty hard treatment . He asked me if I had belonged to certain extremely exclusiveclubs at Yale , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to humiliate me . But I have had a lot of experience . I was beginning to think very well of him ; but I could see that he was living in a capsule of anxiety . " She put her hands over her face . After a moment she regained possession of herself and said in a low voice , " Go on , please ! " I told her about the musical club in Baltimore and about Charles 's crimson reaction . I told her that I had made an experiment and invented a club for card-players which offered rewards for the best and the worst players called the " Tops and Bottoms Club " and aroused the same response . I explained that for boys  --  and probably girls  --  during certain years the English language was a mine-field sown with explosives  --  words , dynamite ; I said that I had rememberedMozart 's letters and that Charles had been brought up by tutors , cut off from the life usually led by boys . I said that he was entrapped in a stage of development which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fear and that what she had called his snobbery was his escape into a world where no shattering word was ever spoken . I had asked him if he would like to work with me in the hope of bringing his French up to Eloise 's standard  --  and that he had agreed to it and that before he left he had shaken my hand and had looked me in the eye . " Mrs. Fenwick , you may remember Macbeth 's question to the doctor concerning Lady Macbeth 's sleepwalking : Canst thou not ... Cleanse the stuffed bosom of that perilous stuff Which weighs upon the heart ? ' " With no tone of reproach she said , " But you are not a doctor , Mr. North . " " No . What Charles needs is a friend with a certain experience in these matters . You can not be sure that doctors are also potential friends . " " You believe that Mozart outgrew his ' childishness ' ? "  | " No . No man does . He outgrows most of his anxiety ; the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows what it is to smile . " " Oh , Mr. North , I 've hated every word you 've said . But I think I can see that you are probably right . Will you accept Charles as a pupil ? " " I must make a proviso . You must discuss it with Mr. Fenwick and Father Walsh . I could teach French syntax to Tom , Dick , and Harry , but now that I have glimpsed Charles 's predicament , I cannotspend all those hours without trying to help . I could n't teach algebra  --  as a friend of mine was paid to do  --  to a girl who was suffering from religious mania ; she was secretly wearing hair shirts and sticking nails into her body . I want your permission to do a thing that I would not dream of doing without your permission . I want to introduce into each lesson a dynamite word ' or two . If I had a student whose mind and heart was absorbed by birds , I would build French lessons about ostriches and starlings . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the student 's inner life . Charles 's inner life is related to a despairing effort to grow up into a man 's world . His snobbery is related to this knot inside him . He wo n't realize it , but my lessons would be based on these fantasies of his  --  of social grandeur and of the frightening world of the tabu . " She had shut her eyes , but opened them again  --  " Excuse me ; what is it you want ? " " A message from you that I may occasionally use low earthy images in the lessons . I want you to trust me not to resort to the prurient and the salacious . I do n't know Charles . He may develop an antagonism against me and report to you and to Father Walsh that I have a vulgar mind . You probably know that ailing patients also cling to their illnesses . " She rose . " Mr. North , this has been a painful conversation for me . I must think it all over . You will hear from me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I bowed saying , " If you agree to my proviso , I can meet Charles in the blue tea room behind us for an hour every Monday , Wednesday , and Friday at eight-thirty . " She looked about confusedly for her children , but Eloise and Charles had been watching us and hurried forward . Eloise said , " Mr. North wo n't let me come to the classes , too ; but I forgive him . " Then she turned and threw her arms about her brother 's stomach and said , " I 'm so glad Charles is going to have them . " Charles , standing very straight above his sister 's shining head , said , " Au revoir , monsieur le pro f esseur ! " Mrs. Fenwick stared at her children with a distraught air and said , " Are you ready to go to the car , dears ? " and led them off . Two days later Eloise approached me at the close of the last of my tennis classes and gave me a note from her mother . I put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to read it ? " " I 'll wait . Just now I 'd rather take you to the La Forge Tea Rooms for a hot fudge sundae . . . . Do you think this note engages me or dismisses me ? " Eloise possessed three forms of laughter . I now heard the long low dove 's ripple . " I sha n't tell you , " she said , having told me . This morning she had chosen to be all of twenty years old but she slipped her hand into mine  --  in full view of Bellevue Avenue , astonishing the horses , shocking the old ladies in their electric phaetons , and very definitely opening the summer season . " Oh , Mr. North , is this really our last class ? Shall I never see you again ? " We did n't sit on high stools before the soda fountain , as once before , but at a table in the furthest corner . " I was hoping that you 'd have a hot fudge sundae with me every Friday morning at exactly this time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We were hungry after all that exercise and addressed ourselves to our sundaes with a will.  | " You really do know a lot about what 's been going on , do n't you , Eloise ? " " Well , no one ever tells a young girl anything so she has to be a sort of witch . She has to learn to read people 's thoughts , does n't she ? When I was a little girl I used to listen at doors , but I do n't do that any more . . . . You grown-ups suddenly woke up about Charles . You saw that he was all caught in . . . a sort of spider 's web ; he was afraid of everything . You must have told Mother something that made her frightened , too . Did you tell her to ask Father Walsh to dinner ? " I remained silent . " He came to dinner last night and after dinner Charles and I were sent upstairs , and they went into the library and had a council of war . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Walsh laughing . Mother 's voice sounded as though she had been crying , but Father Walsh kept shouting with laughter .  --  Please read the letter , Mr. North  --  not to me , of course , but to yourself . " I read : " Dear Mr. North , Reverend Father says to tell you that when he was young he had worked as a counselor at a boys ' camp , too . He told me to tell you to go ahead  --  that he 'll do the praying and you do the work . It comforts me to think of the lady in Salzburgfor whom things worked out so well . Sincerely , Millicent Fenwick . " I do n't believe in unnecessarily hiding things from young people . " Eloise , read the letter , but do n't ask me to explain it to you yet . " She read it . " Thank you , " she said and thought a moment . " Was n't Beethoven born in Salzburg ? We went there when I was about ten and visited his house . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I mean : does it make living harder ? " " No ! It keeps you so busy . You have to be on your toes . . . . It keeps you from growing stale . " " Oh , is that one of your worries ? " " Well , is n't it everybody 's ? " " Not when you 're around .  --  Eloise , I always like to ask my young friends what they 've been reading lately . And you ? "  | " Well , I 've been reading the Encyclopaedia Britannica  --  I discoveredit when I wanted to read about Heloise and Abelard . Then I read about George Eliot and Jane Austen and Florence Night-ingale . " " Some day turn to B and read about Bishop Berkeley , who lived in Newport , and go and visit his house . Turn to M and read about Mozart , who was born in Salzburg . " She slapped her hand to her mouth . " Oh , how boring it must be for you to talk to young girls who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let me be the judge of that , Eloise . Please go on about the Encyclopaedia . " " For another reason I read about Buddhism and glaciers and lots of other things . " " Forgive me asking so many questions , but why do you read about Buddhism and glaciers ? " She blushed a little , glancing at me shyly . " So that I 'll have something to talk about at table . When Papa and Mama give luncheons or dinner parties Charles and I eat upstairs . When relativesor old friends are invited we are invited , too ; but Charles never comes to table if anyone else is there  --  except Father Walsh , of course . When just the four of us are there he comes to table but he scarcely says a word . . . . Mr. North , I 'm going to tell you a secret : Charles thinks he 's an orphan ; he thinks Papa and Mama adopted him . I do n't think he really believes that , but that 's what he says . " She lowered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from another country  --  like Poland or Hungary or even France . " " And you 're the only one who knows that ? " She nodded . " So you see how hard it is for Papa and Mama to make conversation  --  and in front of the servants !  --  with a person who acts as though he were so far away from them . " " Does he think that you are of royal birth also ? " She answered sharply . " I do n't let him . " " So at mealtimes you fill in about Buddhism and glaciers and Florence Nightingale ? " " Yes . . . and I tell them the things you 've told me . About thep178school you went to in China . That filled a whole lunchtime  --  I embroidered it a little . Do you always tell the truth , Mr. North ? " " I do to you . It 's so boring to tell the truth to people who 'd rather hear the other thing . " " I told how in Naples the girls thought you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mario had to leave the room he was laughing so . " Now I 'm going to tell you something . Dear Eloise , if you see that Charles is cutting his way out of that spider 's web a little , you can tell yourself that it 's all due to you . " She looked at me in wonder . " Because when you love someone you communicate your love of life ; you keep the faith ; you scare away dragons . " " Why , Mr. North  --  there are tears in your eyes ! " " Happy tears . " So I met Charles at eight-thirty on the following Monday . In the intervening time he had relapsed somewhat into his haughty distrust ; but he deigned to sit in his chair facing me . He was like a fox watching a hunter from behind a screen of foliage . My Journal does not contain an account of our successive lessons , but I find , pinned into it , an almost illegible schema of our progress  --  the day 's syntactical problem and the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the subjunctive , the four past tenses , and so on ; derriere , coucher , cabinet , and so on . I find no notations for my campaign against snobbery , but it was never long absent from my mind . The day usually began with a little shocker , then went on to forty minutes of pure grammatical grind , concludingwith free practice in conversational French . The entire lesson was conducted in French which  --  for the most part  --  I shall translate here . ( Every now and then I 'll give the reader a little run for his money . ) In the earlier lessons , I used restraint in upsetting his modesty during those conversational twenty minutes  --  though I became increasingly exacting during the grammatical grind  --  to which he responded admirably.  | " Charles , what are these odd-looking kiosks in the streets called  --  these constructions for the convenience of men only ? " He had some difficulty in recalling the word " pissoirs . " " Yes , they also go by a more elegant and more interesting name vespasiennes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the happy idea . Now that you 're older and will be circulating more with maturer persons over there you will be astonished at the lack of embarrassment with which ladies and gentlemen of even the most refined sort refer to such matters . So be prepared for that , will you ? " " Yes , sir . " .. . " Charles , I hope that you will be a student in Paris in your twenties , as I was . We were all poor , but we had a lot of fun . Be sure that you live on the Left Bank , and pretend that you 're poor . Do n't drink too much Pernod ; the only time that I was ever beastly drunk was on Pernod  --  watch that , will you ? What times we had ! I 'll tell you a story  --  it 's a little risque , but you do n't mind a bit of that when it 's not disgusting , do you ? . . . To save money we used to press our pants by putting them under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see ? Well , my roommatewas a music student and one afternoon his professor invited us both to his home for tea with his wife and daughter  --  delightful people . And Madame Bergeron commented on the elegance of his clothing and especially that brilliant crease . Thank you , madame , ' he said , ' Monsieur North and I have a secret about that . Every night we put our trousers under our mattresses . ' Madame Bergeron , laughing heartily , waved her hands in the air , and then politely and smilingly corrected him . " That was a dynamite word . Charles was so stunned that it took him ten minutes to think it over . Maybe it was on that occasionthat for the first time I saw the ghost of a smile on his face . One morning Charles brought me a message from his mother . She invited me to an informal Sunday supper with the family at the end of the week . " Charles , that is very kind of your mother and of you all . Ip180shall write her a note @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rule to accept no invitation whatever . I want you to read the note I shall write to her and I know you both will understand . But it 's very hard to refuse this kindness from your mother . May I tell you in confidence , Charles , that my work carries me into many cottages in Newport and I 've met a number of the admired hostesses in this town . In confidence , not one can hold a candle to your mother for distinction and charm and what the French call race . I 'd always heard that the ladies of Baltimore belonged to a class apart and now I know it to be true . " I struck his elbow . " You 're a lucky man , Charles . I hope you live up to that privilege . I like to think of you finding a hundred delicate ways of expressing not only your affection , but your admiration and gratitude to so remarkable a mother  --  as all French sons do , and  --  I 'm sorry to say  --  all Americansons do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Oui . . oui , monsieur le prof esseur . " " I must say I 'm glad that this kind invitation was n't brought to me  --  face to face  --  by Eloise . The man has n't been born who could refuse a request from Eloise . " I added in English , " Do you understand what I mean ? " He returned my deep glance into his eyes  --  " Yes , " he said , and for the first time he laughed deeply . He understood . But there was still much work to be done . " Bon jour , Charles . " " Bonjour , monsieur le professeur . " " Today we 're going to work with the conditional mood , with verbs ending in ir , and with the second person singular tu . You use tu to children , to your very old friends , and to members of your family , though I 've been told that until about 1914 even husbands and wives addressed one another as vous . You notice that I always address you as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I might address you as tu five years from now . Often in French , and always in Spanish , God is addressed as Tu , capitalp181T . Of course , lovers call each other tu ; all such conversations in bed are in this second person singular . " Up ran the scarlet flag . Forty minutes of grammar drill . Then at ten minutes past nine : " Now for some practice in conversation . Today we 're going to have some man-to-man conversation . We 'd better move to that table in the corner where we wo n't be overheard . " He looked at me in alarm and we moved to the corner . " Charles , you 've been in Paris . After dark you must have often seen certain women of the street strolling singly or in couples . Or you 've heard them addressing passing gentlemen in a low voice from doorways and alleys  --  what do they usually say ? " The scarlet flag was high on the mast . I waited . At last he murmured , strangulatedly , " Voulez-vows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're very young , they may say , ' Tu es seul , mon petit ? Veux-tu que je t'accornpagne ? ' Or you 're sitting alone at a bar and one of these petites dames slides up beside you and puts her arm through yours : ' Tu veux m'offrir un verre ? ' How do you answer these questions , Charles ? You 're an American and a gentleman and you 've had some experience with these encounters . " Charles was in a crimson agony . I waited . Finally he ventured , " Non , mademoiselle . . . merci . " Then added generously , " Pas c e soir . " " Tres bien , Charles ! Could you make it a little more easy and charming ? These poor souls are earning their living . They 're not exactly beggars , are they ? They have something to sell . They 're not contemptible  --  not in France , they are n't . Can you try again ? " " I . . . I do n't know . " At the school where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French . He loves France and goes to France every summer . He hates women and is afraid of them . He prides himself on his virtue and righteousness and he 's a really dreadful man . In Paris he goes for strolls in the evening just so that he can humiliatep182these women . He told the story to us fellow-masters to illustrate what a tower of Christian morality he was . When he 's spoken to by one of these women he turns on her and says , ' Vous me faites ch -- - ! ' That 's a very vulgar expression ; it 's far worse than saying ' You make me vomit . ' He told us that the girl or girls sprang back from him aghast crying , Pourquoi ? Pourquoi ? ' He 'd had his little triumph . What do you think of that ? " " It 's . . . awful . " " One of the most attractive aspects of France is the universal respect for women at every level of society . At home and in public restaurants a Frenchman smiles at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the eye when he thanks her . There 's an undertone of respectful flirtation between every man and woman in France  --  even when she 's a woman of ninety , even when she 's a prostitute .  --  Now let 's act a little one-act play . You go out of the room and come in the door as though you were strolling in one of those streets behind the Opera . I 'm going to pretend I 'm one of those girls . " He did as he was told . He approached me as though he were entering a cage of tigers . " Bonsoir , mon chou . " " Bonsoir , mademoiselle . " " Tu es seul ? Veux-tu t'amuser un peu ? " " le suis occupe ce soir . . . . Merci ! " He threw a wild glance in my direction and added , " Peut-titre une autre fois . Tu es charmante . " " A-o-o ! A-o-o ! . . . Dis donc : une demi-heure , cheri . J'ai une jolie chambre avec tout con f ort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned to me and asked in English , " How do I get out of this ? " " I suggest you make your departure quick , short , but cordial : ' Mademoiselle , je suis en retard . Il faut que je file . Mais au revoir . ' And here you pat her elbow or shoulder , smile , and say , ' Bonne chance , chere amie ! '  |p183He  repeated this several times , elaborating on it . Presently he was laughing . Make-believe is like dreams  --  escape , release . I came to notice that on the days when the lessons began with heavy skirmishing in the " mine-field " area my pupil 's memory and resource were quicker . He could laugh ; he could skate over depth-bombs , and he could make conversation from recollections of his own past . Besides , he was working hard on his grammar exercises between classes  --  and his complexion was clearing up . Another session from the following week , after we 'd had a smart run-through of the gender and plural of three hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have another one-act play . The scene is laid in one of the great restaurants of Paris , Le Grand-Velour . Charles , France is a republic . What became of the royal and imperialfamilies  --  the Bourbons and the Bonapartes ? . . . Oh , yes , they 're around still . . . . What name do they give to the real King of France who is not permitted to use that title and to wear his crown ?  --  He is called the Pretender , the Pretendant . In English that means an impostor ; not in France , where it means merely claimant . He calls himself the Comte de Paris . In this play you are he . You are addressed as Monseigneur or as Votre Altesse . In your veins flows the blood of Saint Louis , king and saint , and of Charlemagne  --  your own name Carolus Magnus  --  and of all those Louis 's and those Henris . " His face was getting very red . " Your secretary has made a reservation for dinner . You arrive exactly on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Your three guests have arrived before you  --  that is etiquette and woe to the guest who 's late . You 're very handsome and you carry yourselfwith extraordinary ease . Naturally the staff of the restaurant is at the highest pitch of excitement . I shall play the proprietor  --  let 's call him Monsieur Vefour . I am waiting at the door . The porter is standing in the street and gives a secret signal when yourp184car is seen approaching at exactly eight o'clock . Now you go out the door and come in . " He did . He was like a person dazed . I bowed and murmured , " Bonsoir , Monseigneur . Vous nous faites un tres grand honneur . " Charles , alarmed , was at his loftiest . He responded with a slight nod . " Bonsoir , monsieur . . . merci . " " One moment , Charles . The greatest noblemen and many of the kings have long established a tone of easy familiarity that would surprise even the President of the United States . Over there the greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The French have a word for cold , condescending self-importance : morgue . You would be horrified if you thought your subjects , the great French people , attributed that quality to you . Now let 's do it again . " Like a stage director I whispered some suggestions to him  --  some business , some lines . Then we did it again . He began to add some ideas of his own . " Do you want to try it again ? Let 's go ! Do anything that occurs to you , as long as you remember that you 're the King of France . By the way when you meet me , you do n't shake hands , you pat me on the shoulder ; but when you meet my son you shake his hand . Allons ! " He entered the restaurant , wreathed in smiles ; he handed his imaginary cape and top hat to an imaginary attendant , saying , " Bonsoir , mademoiselle . Tout va bien ? " I bowed and said , " Bonsoir , Monseigneur . Votre Altesse nous fait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , comment allez-vous ? " " Tres bien , Monseigneur , merci . " " Et madame votre femme , comment va-t-elle ?

Serait-ce encore possible d'ajouter un quatrieme ? J'ai invite Monsieur de Montmorency. 4'a vous generait beaucoup ? " " Pas du tout , Monseigneur . Monsieur le Duc est arrive et Vous attend . Si Votre Altesse aura la bona ' de me suivre . " Charles was agitated ; he was blushing but with a different kind of blush . " Monsieur le pro f esseur . . . can we ask Eloise over to see it ? She 's sitting there , waiting to go home . " " Yes , indeed ! Let me invite her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it up ! . . . Eloise , we 're doing a little one-act play . Would you like to be our audience ? " I explained the scene , the plot , and the characters . Charles surpassed himself . With his hand on my shoulder he told me how his mother had first brought him to this restaurant at the age of twelve . Was it true that I served a dish named after his mother ? On his way to the table he recognized a friend ( Eloise ) among the guests . " Ah , Madame la Marquise . . . there cousine ! " Eloise made a deep curtsy , murmuring , " Mon Prince ! " He raised her up and kissed her hand . At his table he apologized to his guests for being late . " Mes amis , les rues sont si bondees ; c'est la fin du monde . " The Duc de Montmorency ( myself ) assured him that he had arrived exactly on time . And so our entertainment came to an end . Eloise had watched it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . She rose slowly , the tears pouring down her face . She threw her arms around her brother and kissed him with poignant intensity . All I got was a look from her , over his shoulder , but what a look ! She could n't see me , but I could see her . " Charles , " I said , " at our next class I 'm going to give you the examination for those who have completed three years of French . I 'm sure you 'll pass it splendidly and our lessons will be over . " " Over ! "  | " Yes . Teachers are like birds . The moment comes when they must push the young out of the nest . Now you must give your time to American history and physics which I ca n't teach you . " On the following Friday I met Eloise for our visit to the tea room . On this morning she was neither the ten-year-old nor the Countess of Aquidneck and the Adjacent Isles . She was dressed all in white , not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She was someone else  --  not Juliet , not Viola , not Beatrice  --  perhaps Imogen , perhaps Isabella . She did not put her hand in mine but she left no doubt that we were true friends . She walked with lowered eyes . We sat down at our removed table . She murmured , " I 'll have tea this morning . " I ordered tea for her and coffee for myself . Silence with Eloise was as rewarding as conversation . I left it to her . " Last night there were no guests . At table Charles brushed away Mario and held the chair for Mother . He kissed her on the forehead . " She looked at me with a deep smile . " When he sat down he said , ' Papa , tell me about your father and mother and about when you were a boy . ' " " Eloise ! And you were all ready to tell them about the Eskimos . " " No , I was all ready to ask them about the Fenwicks and the Conovers . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you are a child of Heaven ! " She looked at me wide-eyed . " Why did you say that ? " " It just sprang to my lips . " We drank our tea and coffee in silence for a few minutes and then I asked , " Eloise , how do you see your life as it lies before you ? " Again she looked at me wonderingly . " You 're very strange this morning , Mr. North . " " Oh no , I 'm not . I 'm the same old friend . " She reflected a moment and then said , " I 'm going to answer your question . But you must promise not to say one word about it to anyone . "  | " I promise , Eloise Fenwick . " She put her arms on the table and , looking straight into my eyes , said : " I want to be a religious , a nun . " I held my breath . She answered my unspoken question . " I 'm so grateful to God for my father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun and the sea , and for Newport , that I want to give my life to Him . He will show me what I must do . " I returned her solemn gaze . " Eloise , I 'm just an old Protestant on both sides of my family . Forgive me if I ask you this : could n't you express your gratitude to God while living a life outside the religious orders ? " " I love my parents so much ... and I love Charles so much , that I feel that those loves would come between me and God . I want to love Him above all and I want to love everybody on earth as much as I love my family . I love them too much . " And the tears rolled down her cheeks . I did not stir . " Father Walsh knows . He tells me to wait ; in fact I must wait for three years . Mr. North , this is the last time we 'll meet here . I am learning how to pray and wherever I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mama and Charles and for you and "  --  she pointed to the guests in the tea room  --  " for as many of the children of Heaven as I can hold in my mind and heart . " During the rest of the summer our paths crossed frequently . She was disattaching herself from love of her family  --  and naturally from friendship  --  in order to encompass us all in a great offering that I could not understand.  |p188One  day toward the middle of July  --  shortly before I was able to take possession of my apartment  --  I was called to the telephone at the " Y. " " Mr. North ? " " This is Mr. North speaking . " " My name is George Granberry . I should say George Francis Granberry because I have a cousin in town named George Herbert Granberry . " " Yes , Mr. Granberry . " " I 'm told that you read aloud in English  --  English literature and all that . " " Yes , I do . " " I 'd like to make an appointment with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My wife 's a sort of invalid this summer , and it would . . . sort of . . . help her pass the time . Where could we meet and talk about it ? " " I suggest tonight or tomorrow night at the bar of the Muenchinger-King at six-fifteen . " " Good !  --  Tonight at the ' M-K ' at six-fifteen. "  |p189Mr  . Granberry was about thirty-five , young for Newport . He belonged to the category that journalists like Flora Deland call " sportsmen and men-about-town . " Like many others of his kind he had a face that was handsome but wrinkled , even strangely ridged . I first thought this condition was the result of exposure to wind and wave in early youth  --  yacht races , Bermuda Cup trials , and so on ; but later decided it was acquired on dry land and indoors . He had been designed to be a likable fellow , but idleness and aimlessness are erosive too . I received the impression that this interview with a " professor " was discomfiting , perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offered me a drink . I accepted Bevo and we withdrew to the window-seat overlooking Bellevue Avenue and the Reading Rooms . " Mr. North , my wife Myra is the brightest girl in the world . Quick as a whip . She can talk rings about anybody , see what I mean ? But when she was a young girl she had an accident . Fell off a horse . She missed some years of schooling . Schoolteachers came to the house and taught her  --  terrible bores ; you know what schoolteachersare like .  --  Where was I ? Oh , yes : as a result of all this she hates reading a book . The way she puts it , she ca n't stand nonsense  --  The Three Musketeers and Shakespeare and all that . She 's a very realistic girl . But she likes being read to , for a while . I 've tried to read aloud to her , and her nurse , Mrs. Cummings , reads aloud to her , but after ten minutes she says she 'd rather talk instead . Well  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interruption in her education is that sometimes in general conversation she does n't do credit to herself . You know that I-hate-Shakespeare ' stuff and Poetry is for sheep . ' . . . Newport 's full of us Granberryswho think all that 's just bad education and middle-western yap . It 's a little embarrassing for me and my mother and all those cousins I have around . . . . As I told you , just now she 's something of an invalid . She 's pretty well got over that fall from the horse , but she 's had two miscarriages . We 're expecting a child again in about six months . The doctors have ordered her to get a littlep190exercise in the morning and she 's allowed to go out to dinner several evenings in the week , but all the afternoon she 's got to spend resting on a sofa . Naturally she gets pretty bored . She has a bridge teacher twice a week , but she does n't enjoy that . . . and a French teacher . " There was a pause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " In New York they do ; not here . She 's a great talker , but she says that in Newport people just talk at her . She told the doctor to give orders that she 's not to receive callers  --  except me . I love Myra , but I ca n't spend all my afternoons just listening to her . It 's those afternoons she finds hard .... Besides , I 'm a sort of inventor . I have a laboratory in Portsmouth . That takes up a good deal of my time . " " An inventor , Mr. Granberry ! " " Oh , I tinker at some ideas I have . I hope to come on something important some day . . . . Until then I keep it pretty secret . So . . . uh . . . would you be willing to read aloud to her , say three afternoons a week from four to six ? " I took my time . " Mr. Granberry , may I ask you a question ? " " Oh , sure . Go ahead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is some assurance that the student wants to work with me . I ca n't get anywhere with an indifferent or an antagonistic student . Do you think she 'll resent me as she does the bridge teacher ? " " I tell you frankly , it 's a risk . But my wife 's older now . She 's twenty-seven . She knows that she 's missed something . . . and that some of those ladies think she 's a little . . . unfinished . Myra 's not stupid  --  oh , no !  --  but she 's strong-minded and very sincere . If you put her before a firing-squad and asked her to name five plays by Shakespeare , she 'd say , ' Go ahead and shoot ! ' She 's got a skunner against Shakespeare . She thinks he 's piffle . So do I , rather , but I know enough to keep my mouth shut about it . She was born in Wisconsin and up there they do n't allow anybody to tell them anything . " " I was born in Wisconsin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes . " " You 're a Badger ! " " Yes . " All the states have their totems , but the middle-western states are particularly conscious of the animals with which they identify themselves . " Oh , that 'll be a big recommendation . Myra 's very proud of being a Badger . . . . Oh , that 's fine ! Well , do you think you could try it , Mr. North ? " " Yes , but under one condition : the minute that Mrs. Granberry loses interest or becomes impatient , I must resign . " " I 'd be awfully grateful if you 'd give it a try . You may have to be a little patient with her at the beginning . " " I will . " We arranged a schedule . I thought the interview was over , but he had something further on his mind . " Have another Bevo , Mr. North . Have something stronger . Have anything you want . I 'm part owner of this hotel . " " Thank you , I 'll have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think I ought to tell you that one reason I 've asked you to help me about Myra 's reading is the way you behaved in that Diana Bell matter . " I showed no sign of having heard him . " I mean that you made an agreement to say nothing about it and wild horses have n't been able to drag a word out of you about it . In Newport all they do is talk and talk  --  gossip , damned gossip . Can I make the same agreement with you ? " " Certainly . I never talk about my employers . " " I mean : you may be meeting me here and at the house . You met a friend of mine out at dinner , a very charming girl . She enjoyed talking French with you . " " Sir , I have n't been out to dinner once in Newport  --  except at Bill Wentworth 's home . " " It was n't here . It was at Narragansett Pier , at Flora Deland's. "  | " Oh , yes . Miss Desmoulins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be meeting her again over there . I just happen to have missed you twice at Flora Deland 's . I 'd appreciate it if you did n't mention it . . . in certain quarters  --  you see what I mean ? " " I 'd like to return to the subject of Wisconsin again . Did you meet Mrs. Granberry there ? " " Lord , no ! She lived way up in the north near Wausau . Only been there once in my life , the days before the wedding . Met her at parties in Chicago  --  she has cousins there and so have I. " The conversation floundered about ' like a rudderless ship . As I rose to go , he took one more look out of the window and said , " Ah ! There she is ! " A car had drawn up to the curb ; the chauffeur had alighted and opened the door to a lady . Except for her white straw hat she was all in rose from the veils that covered her head to the tips of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first ! " and I opened the front door . French women are taught from the cradle to express delightedsurprise at meeting any man  --  from twelve to ninety  --  whom they have met before . " Ah , Monsieur Nort ' , quel plaisir de vows revoir ! Je suis Denise Desmoulins . . . " et cetera . I expressed my moved admiration of what I saw before me , et cetera , and we parted with expansive hopes of meeting again soon at Narragansett Pier . At the appointed afternoon I wheeled up to the door of " Sea Ledges , " was received and led into Mrs. Granberry 's " afternoon room . " That lady , as beautiful as the morning but not as shy as the dawn , was lying on a chaise-longue . A stout pleasant-looking nurse sat near her knitting . " Good afternoon , Mrs. Granberry . I am Mr. North . Mr. Granberryhas engaged me to read aloud to you . " The lady glared at me in astonishment and silence , probably rage . I was carrying two volumes which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Will you kindly introduce me to your companion ? "  |p193This  was another surprise . She murmured , " Mrs. Cummings , Mr. North . " I crossed and shook hands with Mrs. Cummings . " Are you from Wisconsin too , ma'am ? " I asked . " Oh , no , sir . I 'm from Boston . " " Are you also fond of reading ? " " Oh , I love reading , but I do n't get much time for it , you know . " " Surely some of your patients  --  as soon as they begin to feel better  --  like a bit of reading ? Something light and amusing ? " " We have to be careful , sir . When I was in training the Mother Directress told us about a Sister who had read aloud Mrs. Wiggs of the Cabbage Patch to a surgical case . Had to restitch him , they did . She tells that story to every graduating class . " " It 's a lovely book . I know it well . " Perhaps it was time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house . " Mrs. Granberry , I do n't want to read anything that 's boring and certainly you do n't want to hear anything that 's boring , so I suggest that we draw up some rules  --  " She interrupted me curtly . " What exactly did Mr. Granberry say when he asked you to come and read to me ? " " He said that you were a very intelligent young woman who had lost a year or two of education because of an accident in your childhood ; that you had routine teachers during your convalescence who had given you a prejudice against poetry and some of the standard classics . " " What else did he say ? " " I do n't remember anything else , except his distress that you had to pass these afternoon hours without any interest or occupation . " The expression on her face was strong . " What are these rules that you propose ? " " I suggest that I start reading a book and that you let me read it for a quarter of an hour without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me a sign that I may go on for another quarter of an hour , or a sign that I start some other book . Does that rule seem unreasonable to you , ma'am ? "  | " Do n't call me ma'am . ' Let me make it clear to you , Mr. West , that there 's something behind all this that I do n't like . I do n't like being treated as an idiot child . " " Oh , then , " I said , rising quickly , " there 's been some misunderstanding . I 'll say good afternoon . Mr. Granberry gave me the impression that you might take some pleasure in being read aloud to . " I went over to Mrs. Cummings and shook her hand . " Good afternoon , Mrs. Cummings . I hope I may meet you at another time . Please recall me as Mr. North , not Mr. West . " The lady of the house said sharply , " Mr. North , it 's not your fault that I do n't like the whole idea . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , so please sit down and begin . I agree to your rules . " " Thank you , Mrs. Granberry . " I sat down and began reading : " Emma Woodhouse , handsome , clever , and rich , with a comfortable home and happy disposition , seemed to unite some of the best blessings of existence ; and had lived nearly twenty-one years in the world with very little to distressor vex her . " " Excuse me , Mr. North . Will you read that again , please . " I did . " Who wrote that ? " " Jane Austen . " " Jane Austen . She does n't know anything about life . " " You find it hard to believe , Mrs. Granberry ? " . " Twenty-one !  --  I was n't ugly ; I was n't stupid ; my father was the richest man in Wisconsin . I had a comfortable home and the disposition of an angel . I lived to the age of twenty-three and most of the time was sheer hell . Excuse my language , Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I was out riding my horse and the four days when I ran away to join the circus . Ask any woman who 's honest and she 'll tell you the same thing . . . . But I agreed to let you read for a quarter of an hour . I keep my bargains . What comes next ? "  |p195I  was a little uncomfortable . I remembered that Jane Austen lets us know that any girl with a grain of sense has a rough time in life . I read on . My listener was certainly attentive . When we made the acquaintance of Miss Bates and her mother , she murmured , " Why do people write about old fools ? It 's a waste of time ! " At four thirty-five I looked up and received permission to continue . At six I closed the book and rose . " Thank you , " she said . " Next time start some other book . It 's starting a book that kills me . Once it 's started I can go on by myself . Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it 's in two volumes . " " Leave them here and bring another book next time . " " I 'll say good evening , Mrs. Granberry . " I took leave of Mrs. Cummings also , who said in a low voice , " You read lovely . I had to laugh . Was that wrong ? " At the next session Mrs. Granberry was more amiable . For the first time she gave me her hand . " Are all those Austen books about the feeble-minded ? " " It has often been said that she had a fairly low opinion of men and women . " " She should know some people I know .  --  What 's this new one called ? " " Daisy Miller . It was written by a man who lived in Newport when he was young . " " In Newport ? In Newport ? " " Not far from this very house . " " Then why did he write books ? " " I beg your pardon ? " " If he was so rich why did he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't answer at once . I looked her straight in the eye . She blushed slightly . " Well , " I said slowly , " I think he got tired of buying and selling railroads , and building hotels and naming them after his family , and gambling at Saratoga Springs and betting on horses , and sailing his yacht into the same old ports , and goingp196out to dinner and balls , meeting the same people every night . So he said to himself Before I die I want some real enjoyment . . . . Damn it ! ' He said  --  excuse my language , Mrs. Cummings  --  I 'm going to write it all down  --  how people behave in the world . The fat and the thin , the happy and the unhappy . ' He wrote and wrote  --  over forty solid volumes about men , women , and children . When he died the last book  --  still unfinished on his desk  --  was a novel laid in Newport , called The Ivory Tower , about the emptinessand waste of the life here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and puzzlement . " Mr. North , are you trying to make me look ridiculous ? " " No , ma'am . Mr. Granberry told me that you do n't always do justice to yourself  --  that sometimes out of sheer boredom you say the first thing that comes into your head . As we used to say in Wisconsin , I was just waving a feather under your nose . " She struggled with herself a moment , then directed me to begin . After listening for an hour she said , " Excuse me , but I 'm tired today . I 'll finish that by myself . I 've finished Emma so you can take that back . Does it cost much when you take a book from the library ? " " No . They 're free . " " Anybody can go in and take books home ? Do n't people steal a lot of them ? " " In winter almost three thousand books go in and out every week . Maybe they miss a few from time to time . " " In winter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mrs. Granberry , you do not always do yourself justice . " By the end of the second week we had read the openings of Ethan Frome ( written by a lady who had lived three summers in a cottage nearby ) , lane Eyre , The House of the Seven Gables , and David Copper field . She made few comments , but the sufferings of young David dismayed her . She was thinking of the son she was expecting . " Of course , they were very poor , " she added , as though dismissing the matter . I looked at her fixedly a moment . Again shep197blushed , recalling that the early years of the daughter of the richest man in Wisconsin had been described as " sheer hell . " She stared me down , refusing to concede a fractured logic . I was somewhat in doubt as to whether she had read all those books to the end . I found a moment alone to ask Mrs. Cummings . " Oh , Mr. North , she reads all the time . She 'll ruin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stories turn out . " " She tells me , sir ; it 's as good as a moving-picture ! Jane Eyre ! What happened to her ! Tell me , sir , was that a true story ? " " You know more about life than I do , Mrs. Cummings . Could it be a true story ? " She shook her head sadly . " Oh , Mr. North , I 've known worse things . " One day as we were entering upon the long reaches of Tom Jones , there was a knock at the door . For the first time we received a call from Mr. Granberry . " Can I come in ? " He kissed his wife , shook hands with me , and greeted Mrs. Cummings . " Well , Myra , how are things going ? " " Very well , darling . " " What are you reading , dear ? " " It 's called Tom Jones . " Vague memories of his college education returned to him . He turned to Mrs. Cummings . " Er . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for  --  I mean  --  a lady 's reading ? " " Oh , sir , " said Mrs. Cummings from an unshakable professional authority , " if anything unsuitable happened in a book , I 'd ask Mr. North to return it to the library at once . The important thing is that Mrs. Granberry is really interested , is n't it ? When she 's read aloud to she never gets fretful . I do n't like it when she gets fretful . " " Well , I 'll just sit here for ten minutes . Do n't pay any attention to me . Forgive my interrupting you , Mr. North . " So Mr. Granberrytook a chair in a corner of the room , crossed his long legs , and laid his cheek on his hand , as though he were listening to a burdensome lecture on philosophy back at Dartmouth College . Hep198stayed for a quarter of an hour . Finally he rose with his fingers on his lips and took his leave . Thereafter he returned about once a week , not always able to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jones over a long weekend , but could not be drawn into any comment on it . On another day , I arrived with Walden under my arm . " Good afternoon , Mr. North .... Thank you , I 'm very well ... . Mr. North , you made a rule  --  the fifteen-minute rule . I want to make a rule too . Ivly rule is that after the first forty-five minutes we take half an hour off for talk . " " As you wish , Mrs. Granberry . " There was an ormolu clock on the table beside her . At a quarter of five she interrupted me . " It is now talking time . What did you mean two weeks ago when you said something about the emptiness and waste ' of life at Newport ? " " Those were not my words . I was reporting to you what Henry James said . " " In Wisconsin we do n't quibble . You said it and you meant it . " " I do n't know Newport life well enough to make any judgment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks . I have no part in Newport life . I come and go on a bicycle . Most of my students are children . " " Do n't quibble with me . You must be twenty-eight years old . You 've been to college . You 've been in dozens of Newport cottages . You sit up half the night at Nine Gables . ' You get drunk at the Muenchinger-King bar . Stop running away from my ques-tions . " " Mrs. Granberry  --  ! " " Do n't call me ma'am ' again and do n't call me Mrs. Granberry . ' Call me Myra . ' " I raised my voice . " Mrs. Granberry , I make it a rule that in all the houses where I work I use only family names and I wish to be called by my own . "  | " You and your rules ! We 're from Wisconsin . Do n't be an Easterner . Do n't be a stuffed owl . " We glared at each other . Mrs. Cummings said , " Oh , Mr. North , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  seeing "  --  and she gave me a significantglance  --  " that you are both Badgerers . " " Of course , I shall obey any request from Mrs. Cummings  --  but in this room only and in her presence only . I have a great admiration for Mrs. Cummings . She is an Easterner and I wish you would apologize to her for having called her a stuffed owl . " " Oh , Mr. North , Mrs. Granberry was just joking . I do n't mind at all . " I looked sternly at Myra and waited . " Cora , I admire you and am deeply indebted to you and I apologize if I have hurt your feelings in any way . " Mrs. Cummings covered her face with her knitting . " Theophilus , I promise not to interrupt you if you tell us about your life in Newport  --  your friends , your good times , your enemies , and if you 're making any money . " " This is not in my contract and I do n't like it , but I shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made up ' names . I live at the Young Men 's Christian Association and am saving up money to rent a small apartment . I do not make friends easily , but to my surprise I have already made several in Newport whom I highly value . " I told them about the superintendent at the Casino , about an unoccupied valet named " Eddie " ( " who talks just like some of the characters in David Copper field " ) , about some of my tennis pupils  --  including a girl named " Anemone " who was just like some of the girls in Shakespeare 's plays  --  and about " Mrs. Willoughby 's " boardinghouse for domestic servants . I did full justice to " Mrs. Willoughby 's " decorum and generosity . When I came to a close there were tears in Myra 's eyes . There was a pause . " Oh , Cora , I wish I were a maid . I wish I lived at Mrs. Willoughby 's . I 'd be happy . My baby would be born as simply andp200sweetly as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't you take Cora and me to Mrs. Willoughby 's some night ? " " Oh , Mrs. Granberry , " said Cora righteously , " I 'm a registered nurse . I 'm not allowed to do anything like that . " " You go out to dinner parties with me . " ' Yes , I sit upstairs until you are ready to go home . " " Myra , " I said quietly , " it would n't be possible . Everybody likes to be with his or her own kind . " " I would n't talk . I know that just to look at it would be good for my baby . " I nodded and smiled and said , " Conversation time is up . " At the following session 's conversation break I asked Myra to give me an account of her friends , her good times , and her enemies . She thought a moment . Her face took on a somber cast . " Well , I grow older . I wait for my baby . I eat breakfast . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He gets ten dollars for that . Then if it 's a sunny day Cora and I go to Bailey 's Beach . We sit well wrapped up in a sheltered corner so as not to have to talk to people . We sit and watch the old boots and orange crates drift by " " I beg your pardon ? " " My father owns hundreds of lakes . If any one were as dirty as Bailey 's Beach he 'd drain it and plant it with trees . What do we do then , Cora ? " " You go to luncheon parties , Mrs. Granberry . " " Yes , I go to luncheon parties . Ladies . There are men there only on Sundays , all named Granberry . During the week the ladies stay on and play cards . I 'm allowed to go home early for my nap because I 'm in an interesting condition , ' as the lady in Jane Eyre was . Then my tutors arrive . Several evenings a week I go out to dinner and see the same people  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early and I read as long as Cora lets me . And I ca n't think of anything else to tell you . " I turned to Mrs. Cummings . " May we ask what you do in your free time ? "  |p201She  glanced at me for reassurance . I nodded and maybe I winked at her . " Well , I have an old friend in Newport . She went through trainingwith me  --  Miss O'Shaughnessy . She 's assistant director of nursing at the hospital . At six o'clock on Thursdays Mrs. Granberrykindly has me driven to the hospital in her car . And Miss O'Shaughnessy and I  --  and sometimes some friends of hers  --  go to dinner at a restaurant near the beginning of the Cliff Walk . We tell stories of our training days and , Mr. North  --  being off duty  --  we have a little bit of the Old Irish and we laugh . I do n't know why it is but mostly nurses laugh when they 're off duty . And Sundaymornings four of us go to Mass together . Rain or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm always glad to get back to this house , Mrs. Granberry . " Myra was staring at her . " I know Miss O'Shaughnessy . During my second summer here George let me join the Ladies Volunteer Workers at the hospital . I loved it . I could n't do it the other summersbecause the doctor would n't let me . I hope Miss O'Shaughnessyremembers me ; I hope she liked me . Could n't I come with you some Thursday night ? " There was a silence . " I never see anybody that 's fun . I never see anybody I like . I never laugh , do I , Cora ? " " Oh , Mrs. Granberry , you forget ! You laugh and you make me laugh . When I go to the kitchen they sometimes ask me , What do Mrs. Granberry and you laugh about all the time ? ' " " Myra , " I said , with a shade of severity , " it would n't be any holiday for Mrs. Cummings to have dinner with you on Thursday nights . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't have to be Thursday nights . I still have my Volunteer'suniform . Mr. North , will you be so kind as to ring that bell ? " A servant appeared . " Please ask Madeleine to bring down my Hospital Volunteer 's uniform  --  and to lay it out in the dressingroom down here . I wo n't want the shoes and stockings , but tell her not to forget the cap . Thank you . You 've never seen me in my uniform , Cora.  --  It would n't have to be on a Thursday night . Wep202could go on some other night and have a bit of the Old Irish and laugh . The doctor says that a little whiskey would n't be bad for me at all .  --  Besides , I love being in disguise . Cora , you could call me Mrs. Nielson . ' Ca n't we go ? Maybe Miss O'Shaughnessy could get an extra leave on another night . My husband 's on the Hospital Board ; he can do anything . " We talked reassuringly about the project . Myra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel more free . " There was a knock at the inner door and a voice said , " The uniform is ready , Mrs. Granberry . " Myra rose saying " I 'll only be a minute , " and left the room . Mrs. Cummings confided to me . " The doctor says we 're to let her do anything she wants within reason . Poor child ! Poor child ! " We waited . Presently she returned smiling , downright radiant , free , in that uniform , in that cap . We clapped our hands . " I am Miss Nielson , " she said . She leaned over Mrs. Cummings and asked soothingly , " Where does it hurt , dear ? . . . Oh , that 's just wind . You must expect that after an operation . It 's a sign that all 's going well . Your appendix will never trouble you again . " She resumed her place on the chaise-longue . " I 'd have been happy as a nurse , I know I would .  --  Mr. North , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just talk . " " Very well . What shall we talk about ? " " Anything . " " Myra , why do you never make any comment on these novels we 've been reading ? " She blushed slightly . " Because . . . you 'd make fun of me . You would n't understand . They 're all so new to me  --  those lives , those people . Sometimes they 're more real than life . I do n't want to talk about them . Please talk about something else . " " Very well . Are you fond of music , Myra ? " " Concerts ? Heaven help us ! In New York we go Thursday nights to the opera . The German ones are the longest . " " The theater ? " " No . I went a few times . It 's all ' made up . ' It 's not at all likep203the novels ; they 're real . Why are you asking me these questions ? " I paused a moment . What was I doing in that house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week ( though my fortnightlybills had not yet been paid ) ; that I derived some satisfaction from introducing a bright but inadequately educated young woman to good reading  --  a pastime to render less painful her husband 's neglect . But I was discouraged  --  as I was with others I worked with on the Avenue -- by association with those who had more than their share of the disadvantages of their advantages . She had asked me why I asked her those questions . " Because , Myra , there is a theory that expectant mothers can prepare themselves to bear beautiful well-conditioned children by listening to beautiful music and gazing at beautiful objects . " " Who says that ? " " It 's widely held . Italian mothers believe it especially , and everyone can see that their boys and girls look as though they had stepped out of those famous Italian paintings . " " Are there any in Newport  --  those paintings ? " " Not that I know of  --  except in books . " She was sitting up straight and looking at me fixedly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea ? " " Oh , Mrs. Granberry ! Doctors are always urging ladies in this condition to have lovely thoughts  --  oh , yes . " Myra continued to stare at me almost angrily . " Well , do n't just sit there like a stick . Tell me what I can do . " " Please lie down and shut your eyes and let me talk to you . " She looked about her as though annoyed and then did as I requested . " Myra , Newport is often said to be one of the most beautiful towns in this country . You drive up and down Bellevue Avenue and pay visits in the cottages of your friends . You go to Bailey 's Beach and you have told me what you think of it . Do you often take the ten-mile drive ? " " It 's too long . If you 've seen one mile you 've seen them all . " " The architecture of the so-called cottages is the laughing-stock of the nation . They are preposterous . There are only three thatp204can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let me tell you my idea of Newport . " So I told her about the trees and  --  at considerable length  --  about the Nine Cities of Troy and the Nine Cities of Newport . Mrs. Cummings let her knitting fall to her lap , motionless . " Moreover , the view of the sea and the bay from the Budlong place , five miles from here , is one of which you could never grow tired  --  at dawn , at noon , at dusk , under the stars , and not least , in wind and rain . There you can see the circling beams of six lighthousesthat give security to sailors and hear the voice of many buoys saying , Steer clear of these rocks and you will have a safe journey . ' All of Newport is interesting in one way or another ; the least so is the Sixth City . " " You mean here ? " " And the most interesting and beautiful is the Second . " " I forget which that is . " " That of the eighteenth century . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now can we go back to Walden ? " She put her hand to her forehead . " I 'm tired today . Will you excuse me , if I ask you to leave now ? I want to think . We 'll pay you just the same . . . . But stop ! Before you go write down the names of those painters in Italy that help make beautiful children , and some pieces of music that are good for that too . " I wrote down : " Raphael . Da Vinci . Fra Angelico , " and added an address in New York where the best prints could be obtained . Then : " Gramophone records by Mozart : Eine Kleine Nachtmusik . Ave , verum corpus . " There was a knock at the door . Mr. Granberry entered . Greetings . " How 's my dear little squirrel today ? " " Very well , thank you . " " What are you reading now ? " " Walden . " " Walden , oh , yes  --  Walden . Well , that would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why not , George ? " He pinched her cheek . " We would n't be happy on thirty cents a day . " " I like it . It 's the first book I want to read all through in class . George , this is a list of all the books I 've read . I want you to buy every one of them for me . Mr. North has to go and get them at the People 's Library . They 're not very clean and people have written silly things in the margins . I want my own books so that I can write my own silly things in the margins . " " I 'll see to that , Myra . My secretary will send for them tomorrowmorning . Is there anything else I can do for you ? " " Here are the names of some painters who lived in Italy . If you want to be an angel , you can buy me some pictures by them . " He gasped . " Why , Myra , any pictures by one of these men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you pay more than that for those boats you never use , do n't you ? You can buy me one and Papa will buy me another . Here 's the name of a man who wrote some good music . Please buy me the best gramophone that you can find and those records . ... I 'm a little tired today and I 've just asked Mr. North to cut short the reading . I told him we 'd pay him just the same . . . but do n't you go . " Then something very painful happened . Two days later I was met at the door , as usual , by the butler , Carel , a Czech  --  as distinguished in appearance as an ambassador but as self-effacing as an ambassador 's personal secretary . He bent his head and whispered , " Mrs. Cummings wishes to speak to you here , sir , before you enter the morning room . " " I 'll wait here , Carel . " Carel and Mrs. Cummings must have arranged some system of coded signals , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mrs. Granberry received two letters this morning which have upset her badly . I think she wants to tell you about them . Shep206would n't go for a drive . She has scarcely said a dozen words to me . When you leave , please tell Carel anything I should know . Wait three minutes before you knock on the door . " She pressed my hand and returned to the morning room . I waited three minutes and knocked on the door . It was opened by Mrs. Cummings . " Good afternoon , ladies , " I said buoyantly . Myra 's face was very stern . " Cora , I have something that I must discuss with Mr. North and I must ask you to leave the room for five minutes . " " Oh , Mrs. Granberry , you must n't ask me to do that . I 'm an R.N. and I must obey every word of the doctor 's orders . " " All I ask is that you go out on the verandah . You can leave the door ajar , but you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I do n't like it at all ; oh , I do n't like it at all . " " Mrs. Cummings , " I said , " since this seems to be an important matter to Mrs. Granberry I shall stand by the verandah door where you can see me every minute . If any subject arises that has to do with medical matters I shall insist on repeating it to you . " When Mrs. Cummings had withdrawn to a distance I stood waiting like a sentry . " Theophilus , Badgers always tell the truth to Badgers . " " Myra , I am my own judge of what truths I shall tell . The truth can do just as much harm as a lie . " " I need help . " " Ask me some questions and I shall try to help you so far as I am able . " " Do you know a woman named Flora Deland ? " " I have dined at her house at Narragansett Pier three times . " " Do you know a woman named Desmoulins ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I have met her by chance on the street in Newport once . " " Is she a harlot and a strumpet and that other thing in Tom Jones  --  a doxy ? "  | " No , indeed . She is a woman of some refinement . She is what some people would call an ' emancipated ' woman . I would never think of applying those ugly words to her . " " Emancipate ' means to free the slaves . Was she a slave ? " I laughed as cheerily as I could . " Oh , no.  --  Now stop this nonsenseand tell me what you are trying to get at . " " Is she better-looking than I am ? " " No . " " Badger ? " " Badger ! " " BADGER ? " " BADGER !  --  She IS a very pretty woman . You are a very beautiful woman . I 'll go and call Mrs. Cummings . " " Stop !  --  Have you had dinner almost every Thursday night with my husband and Miss Desmoulins at the Muenchinger-King ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point . " " I have received two an-anonny-mous letters . " " Myra ! You tore them up at once . " " No . " She lifted a book on the table and revealed two envelopes . " I 'm ashamed of you .... In the world  --  and especially in a place like Newport  --  we are surrounded by people whose heads are filled with hate and envy and nastiness . Once in a while one of them takes to writing anonymous letters . They say it comes and goes in epidemics , like influenza . You should have torn them into small pieces  --  unread  --  and put them out of your mind . Do they say that I had dinner with those two persons at the M-K ? " " Yes . " " Well , that 's a sample of the lies that fill anonymous letters . " " Read them . Please read them . " I debated with myself : " Hell , I 'm resigning from this job tonight anyway . " I studied the envelopes carefully . Then I glanced through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to the end of the secondp208I burst out laughing . " Myra , all anonymous letters are signed either by ' A Friend ' or ' Your Well-Wisher . ' " She burst into tears . " Myra , no Badger cries after the age of eleven . " " I 'm sorry . " " Years ago , Badger , I planned to make my life-career that of being a detective . When boys are ambitious they really are ambitious . I read all the professional handbooks about it  --  hard , tough books of instruction . And I remember that the tracing down of anonymous letter writers was an important section . We were taught that there are twenty-one ' give-away ' clues to every anonymousletter . Give me these letters and in two weeks I 'll find the writer and drive him  --  or her  --  out of town . " " But , Theophilus , maybe him or her is right . Maybe my husband loves Miss Desmoulins . Maybe my baby has no father any more . Then I might as well die . Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world . " " Badgers do n't cry , Myra  --  they fight . They 're smart , they 're brave , and they defend what they 've got . They also have something that I find missing in you . " She looked at me , appalled . " What ? " " They 're like otters . They have a sense of fun and laughter and wicked tricks . " " But , Theophilus , I 've always had them too . But lately I 've had so much illness and lonesomeness and boredom . Believe me , my father used to call me his ' little devil . ' Oh , Theophilus , put your arm around me one minute . " Laughingly I squeezed her hand hard and said , " Not one second !  --  Now promise me that you 'll put this whole wretched business out of your head for a week . . . . Badgers always catch the snake . Can I call Mrs. Cummings now ? . . . Mrs. Cummings , it 's school time . Mrs. Cummings , you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about . Mrs. Granberry heard an ugly bit of gossip . I told her that no one who 's intelligent and beautiful and rich has ever escaped gossip . Are n't I right ? " " Oh , Mr. North , you 're very right . "  |p209Naturally  that about the twenty-one clues was sheer kite-flying . In my hasty glance at the letter I read that Mr. Granberry entertainedMlle . Desmoulins at dinner in one of the small dining rooms at the Muenchinger-King every Thursday night . It went on to tell of Flora Deland 's dinners , mentioned myself , bloodwarmingly , as an " odious person , " then rambled on in a grieved self-righteous way . I judged that they had been written by a woman , some former friend of George Granberry , that unoccupied planless inventor  --  perhaps by a Granberry . I returned to our classroom work as though nothing had intervened to upset it . We read Walden . I needed help  --  that is to say , I needed to know more . I arranged to meet Henry for a pool game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he knew George F : Granberry . He was chalking his cue thoughtfully and said , " Funny , your asking me that , " and went on with the game . When the set was over we paid up and withdrew to a corner and ordered our usual . " I do n't like to mention names . We 'll call the party Longears . Choppers , under idleness all men and women become children again . Women cope with it better than men , but all men become babies . Look at me : when my Chief 's away I have to fight it every minute . Fortunately , just now I 'm busy . Edweena and I are exchangingletters and making plans . We 're the Governors of the Servants ' Ball at the end of the season and that takes a lot of hard work . . . . Longears belongs to a very large family . He could get a job any minute in the family 's firm , but it 's stuffed already with a dozen members of the same name , all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . He does n't need the money . Before the War there were scores of young and middle-aged men like him in New York and Newport , rich , and idle as tailors ' dummies . In 1926 you can count ' em on one hand . When I arrived here he was already a divorced man  --  so maybe the blight had set in early . Everybody said he used to be intelligent and popular . For some reason he could n't get into the War . He married again  --  a girl from the Wild West , like Tennessee or Buffalo . She has poorp210health . Nobody sees her much . Men like that take to drink or women or gambling . A few take to boasting , to setting themselves up as some kind of superior person  --  something special . Longears pretends that he 's an inventor . He has a workshop out in Portsmouth  --  verysecret , very important . Rumors  --  some say he 's makingbread out of seaweed or making gasoline out of manure . Anyway , he hides there . Some people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electric trains or stick postage stamps into his collection . . . . Used to be a fine fellow . He was my Chief 's best friend , but now my Chief just wags his head when he 's mentioned . " " Was it the divorce that broke him up ? " " I would n't know . I think it 's merely nothing-to-do . Idleness is dry rot . . . . He has a girl hidden in the bushes here somewhere  --  he 's not the only one who does that , of course . . . . That 's all I know . " At the next session I appeared with a satchel under my arm . Among the books it contained were three school editions of Twelfth Night and three of As You Like It . I had worked for hours on them , selecting scenes for group reading . " Good afternoon , ladies . Today we are going to try something new . " I drew out the copies of Twelfth Night . " Oh , Theophilus  --  not Shakespeare ! Please ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hypocritical wonder . I began cramming the copies back into the satchel . " That surprises me , but you remember we agreed at our first meeting that we 'd not read anything that bored you . Excuse me ! My mistake is due to my inexperience . Hitherto I 've tutored only boys and young men . After a short resistance I 'd found that they take to Shakespeare enthusiastically . I 've had them striding up and down my classroom pretending to be Romeo and Juliet and Shylock and Portia  --  eating it up ! . . . I remember now how surprised I was when Mr. Granberry also said that he had always thought Shakespeare to be piffle . ' Well , I have another novel here to try . "  |p211Myra  was staring at me . " Wait a minute ! . . . But his plays are so childish . All those girls dressing up in men 's clothes . It 's idiotic ! " " Yes , a few of them . But notice how Shakespeare has arranged it . The girls have to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wall . Viola is shipwrecked in a foreign country ; Rosalind is exiled  --  thrown out into the wilderness ; Imogen has been slanderedin her husband 's absence . Portia dresses like a lawyer to save the life of her husband 's best friend . In those days a self-respecting girl could n't go from door to door asking for a job . . . . Let 's forget it ! . . . But what girls they are : beautiful , brave , intelligent , resourceful ! In addition , I 've always felt they have a quality that I 've found . . . a little ... missing in you , Myra . " " What 's that ? " " A humorous mind . " " A what ? " " I do n't know exactly what I mean , but I get the impression that they 've observed life so attentively  --  young though they are  --  that they do n't shrink from the real ; they 're never crushed or shocked or at their wit 's end . Even when the big catastrophe comes their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with humor and gaiety . When Rosalind is driven out into that dangerous wilderness she says to her cousin Celia : Now go we in contentTo liberty , and not to banishment . I wish I 'd heard Ellen Terry say that ; and soon after Viola had lost her brother in that shipwreck someone asks her about her family and she  --  dressed as a boy and now called Cesario  --  says : I am all the daughters of my father 's house , And all the brothers too . I wish I 'd heard Julia Marlowe say that . " Myra asked me harshly , " What good does it do you  --  this famous humorous mind ' ? " " Shakespeare places these clear-eyed girls among a lot of peoplep212who are in an incorrect relation to the real . As a later author said , ' Most of the people in the world are fools and the rest of us are in great danger of contagion . ' A humorous mind enables us to accommodate ourselves to their folly  --  and to our own .  --  Do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Oh , Mr. North , I think that 's why nurses laugh when they 're off duty . It helps us  --  like you might say  --  to survive . " Myra was staring at me without seeing me . Mrs. Cummings asked , " Mrs. Granberry , ca n't we ask Mr. North to read to us a little out of Shakespeare ? " " Well . . . if it 's not too long . " I put my hand tentatively into the satchel . " My idea was that we all take parts . I 've underlined Myra 's part in red , and Mrs. Cummings 's in blue , and I 'll read the rest . " " Oh , " cried Mrs. Cummings , " I ca n't read poetry-English . I could n't do that . You 've got to excuse me . " " Cora , if that 's the way Mr. North wants it , I suppose we must let him have his way . " " God bless my soul ! " " Now slowly , everybody  --  slowly ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plays  --  and repeated them , switching roles  --  and the balcony scene from Romeo and Juliet and the trial scene from The Merchant of Venice . Mrs. Cummings astonished herself as Shylock . It was Myra who , at the end of each scene , said , " Now let 's do it again ! " One afternoon Myra greeted me at the door with an air of suppressed excitement . " Theophilus , I asked my husband to come here at four-thirty . We 're going to do the trial scene from The Merchant of Venice and I 'm going to make him play Shylock . You be Antonio , I 'll be Portia , and Cora will be everybody else . Let 's rehearse it once before he comes . Cora , I want you to be splendid as the Duke . " " Oh , Mrs. Granberry ! "  |p213We  put our hearts into it . Myra had memorized her lines . A knock on the door : enter George F. Granberry II . Myra was silken . " George darling , we want you to help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make me very unhappy . " " What can I do ? " She put the open book in his hands . " George , you must read Shylock . Go very slowly and be very bloodthirsty . Sharpen the knife on your shoe . Mr. North is going to lean backward over that desk with his chest exposed and his hands tied behind him . " " Now , Myra , that 's enough ! I 'm no actor . " " Oh , George ! It 's just a game . We 'll do it twice so you 'll get the hang of it , and go slowly . " We started off haltingly , groping for our words on the page . As Shylock leaned over me , an ivory paper-cutter in his hand , he said under his voice , " North , I 'd like to cut out your gizzard . Something 's going on here that I do n't like . You 've fouled up the whole air around here . " " You engaged me to interest your wife in reading and especially in Shakespeare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resign when you pay the three two-week bills I 've sent you . " That took his breath away . During the first rehearsal Myra had made a show of reading indifferently and stumbling over her words . On the second time around we played for all we were worth . Myra laid aside her book ; at first she represented the young lawyer Balthasar with a slight playful swagger , but she grew in authority speech after speech . George was caught up into the spirit of the thing . He roared for his " bond " and his pound of flesh . Again he leaned over me , savagely , knife in hand . Then something extraordinary took place . PORTIA : Do you confess the bond ? ANTONIO : I do . PORTIA : Then must the Jew be merciful . SHYLOCK : On what compulsion must I ? Tell me that !  |p214Here  George felt a hand rest on his shoulder and heard behind him a voice saying  --  gravely , earnestly , from some realm of maturity that had been long absent from his life : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It droppeth like the gentle rain .. . ... We do pray for mercy ; And that same prayer doth teach us all to render The deeds of mercy ... . George straightened up and threw down the ivory knife . He said confusedly , " Go on with your reading . I 'll see you . . . another time , " and he left the room . We looked at one another surprised and a little guilty . Mrs. Cummings took up her sewing . " Mr. North , play-acting is a little too exciting for us all . I have n't said much about it , but Mrs. Granberry always stands up and moves about the room . I do n't think the doctor would like that . We have n't had a talk-time lately . You told Mrs. Granberry you 'd tell her sometime what it was like when you went to school in China . " I vowed that I 'd send in my resignation that night  --  before I was fired  --  but I did n't and I was n't . I was more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her and proud of my work . A check arrived for me in Monday morning 's mail . We began Huckleberry Finn . On Friday another surprising thing happened . I bicycled up to the portal of the house . I saw a young man of about twentyfourstrolling on the lawn , smelling a long-stemmed rose . He was dressed in the height of fashion  --  straw hat , blazer of the NewportYacht Club , flannels , and white shoes . He approached me and put out his hand . " Mr. North , I believe . I am Caesar Nielson , the twin brother of Myra Granberry . How d' you do ? " Zounds ! Holy cabooses ! It was Myra . God , how I hate transvestism ! I shuddered ; but never contradicta pregnant woman.  | " Is your sister at home , Mr. Nielson ? " " We 've ordered the car . We thought it would be nice to drive to Narragansett Pier and ask your friend Mademoiselle Desmoulins for a cup of tea . " " Sir , you forget that I am employed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am only here under the conditionsof my contract . Will you excuse me ? I do n't wish to be late for my appointment .  --  Would you like to join us ? " I looked up at the house and saw Mrs. Cummings and Carel , stricken , watching us from the drawing-room windows . Faces were similarly framed in many windows of the upper floors . Myra carne nearer to me and murmured , " Badgers fight to defend what they 've got . " " Yes , but since nature made them small she made them clever . No well-conditioned badger or woman destroys her home to preserveit . Please precede me , Mr. Nielson . " She entered the house disturbed , but chin up . As I followed her through the hall Carel said to me in a low voice , " Mr. Granberryhas been in the house for half an hour , sir . He returned by the coachhouse drive . " " Do you think he saw the show ? " " I 'm sure he did , sir . " " Thank you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I followed Myra and Mrs. Cummings into the morning room . " Myra , please change your clothes quickly . Mr. Granberry is in the house and will probably be here in a few minutes . He will probably dismiss Mrs. Cummings and me , and your next few months will be very dreary indeed . " " Shakespeare 's girls did it . " " Please leave the door of your dressing room open two inches so that I can talk to you while you are changing your clothes .  --  Can you hear me ? " But we were too late . Mr. Granberry entered the room withoutp216knocking . " Myra ! " he called . She appeared at the door , still Caesar Nielson . She returned his angry gaze unabashed . " Pants ! " he said , " PANTS ! " " I 'm an emancipated woman like Miss Desmoulins . " " Mrs. Cummings , you are leaving the house as soon as you can pack . Mr. North , will you follow me into the library ? " I bowed low to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the library Mr. Granberry was seated behind the desk like a judge . I sat down and crossed my legs composedly . " You broke your promise to me . You told my wife about NarragansettPier . " " Your wife told me about Narragansett Pier . She had received two anonymous letters . " He blanched . " You should have told me that . " " I was engaged by you to be a reader of English literature , not a confidential friend of the family . " Silence . " You 're the biggest nuisance in town . Everybody 's talking about the hell you kicked up among the Bosworths at Nine Gables . ' And Heaven knows what 's going on at the Wyckoff place . I 'm sorry I called you in.  --  God , I hate Yale men ! " Silence . " Mr. Granberry , I hate injustice and I think you do too . " " What 's that got to do with it ? " " If you dismiss Mrs. Cummings as incompetent in her profession , by God , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agency sent her telling them what I found here . " " That 's blackmail . " " No , that is a deposition in a suit for slander . Mrs. Cummings is obviously a superior trained nurse . In addition  --  as far as I can see  --  she has been your wife 's only friend and support in a difficulttime . " I put a slight emphasis on the word " only . " Another silence.  |p217He  looked at me somberly . " What do you suggest I do ? " " I seldom offer advice , Mr. Granberry . I do n't know enough . " " Stop hammering that ' Mr. Granberry . ' Since we hate each other I suggest we use first names . I 'm told that you are called Teddie . " " Thank you . I do n't give advice , George , but I think it would help you if you just talked to me at random about the whole situa-tion .

All right , I know what you 're thinking . I 'll give her a pack of Granberry stock and send her back to Paris . But what the hell will I do here ? Play Shakespeare all day ? . . .

" " George , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He rose , threw me an angry glance , sauntered about the room , then placed his hands on the lintel above the door into the hall and hung there  --  as boys with their excess energy do ( and to hide their faces ) . " Well , " he said , " I 'll tell you . The principal reason is to hide myself . To wait for something , to wait for things to get worse or to get better . ' What I do ' is to play war-games . Since I was a boy I 've played with tin soldiers . I was n't able to get into war service because of some malfunction of the heart . . . .

" " Thank you , sir . "  |p220At  the bottom of Broadway , at a corner of Washington Square and across the street from Old Colony House , there stood a store that I visited daily . It sold newspapers , magazines , picture postcards , maps for tourists , toys for children , and even Butterick patterns . It was very Ninth City . It was run by one family , the Materasfather , mother , son , and daughter took turns serving the public . I was to learn that their name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America they adopted the name of their birthplace to simplify the formalities at Ellis Island . They came from the desolate impoverished part of the instep of Italy 's boot that the government of Rome and  --  as we are told in Carlo Levi 's fine book Cristo si e fermato a Eboli  --  God forgot . The title does not mean that Christ stopped at Eboli to enjoy the environs , but that in despair He went no further . I love Italians . My friendship with the Materas began with my attempts to ingratiate myself by speaking their language , howeverhaltingly . I barely made myself understood . I then tried the Neapolitan dialect even more haltingly ( yet how I relished it ! ) ,  |p221but  the dialects of Lucania are impenetrable to the outsider . We conversed in English . High among the glories of Italy are the mothers of Italy . Their whole self is delivered over to husband and children . Through sheer selflessness they become wonderful selves . Maternal love there has no element of possessiveness ; it is a hearth-fire of astonishedwonder , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own . It can be just as dangerous for the growing girl and especially the growing boy as devouring maternal love  --  so often prevalent in other parts of the world  --  can be ; for what young person can wish to break away from the warmth and support of all that devotion , laughter , and cooking ? Mamma had love and laughter to spare . I stopped in at the store daily to buy my New York paper , and pencils , ink , or other incidentals . I bowed to the parents with due deference and to the children with comradely liveliness and before long came within the orbit of Signora Carla 's generous heart . The Materas were of a dark complexion ( the Saracen invaders of Calabria ) . Rosa , twentyfour , seemed to be unaware that some might regard . her as plain ; helping her parents and brother was quite sufficient to fill her life with buoyancy . Benjy , twenty-two  --  when it was his turn to mind the store  --  sat cross-legged on a shelf beside the cash register . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unpronounceableto Signora Matera ; the only ones she knew well ( and revered ) were " Presidente Vilson " and " Generale Perchin . " Exceptvery occasionally I am not going to attempt to reproduce the signora 's pronunciation . After a certain time we cease to notice a valued foreigner 's " accent " ; the communications of friendship transcend the accidents of language . One late afternoon I returned to the " Y " and was informed by the desk clerk that a lady was waiting for me in the little reception room off the lobby . What was my surprise to discover Signora Matera sitting majestically at ease , with a six-weeks-old clipping of my newspaper advertisement in her hand . I greeted her delightedly.  |p222She  was amazed . She waved the clipping . " You . . . you are Mr. Nort ' ? " " Yes , signora . I thought you knew my name . " She repeated with heart-felt relief : " You are Mr. Nort ' ! " " Yes , cara signora . What can I do for you ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take lessons with you . He wants to study Dante with you . He makes money ; he can pay you very well . He wants to read Dante with you for eight hours  --  that is sixteen dollars . You know Benjamino ? " " Yes , indeed , I know Benjamino . I see him almost every day in your store and I often see him at the People 's Library where he is surrounded by dozens of books . But , of course , we are not allowed to talk in the library . Tell me about him . Why is he alwaysup in one place by the cash register ? " " You did not know he is a cripple ? He has no feet . " " No , signora , I did not know that . " " When he was five he ran into a train and lost his feet . " Her memory of that terrible occasion was all in her eyes and I met it ; but she had lived so many days since in wondering astonishment and love of her son that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell me . " Benjy is a very bright boy . He wins prizes every week . He does all the puzzles in the papers . You know how many papers and magazines we have . He wins all the contests in the advertisements . Checks come in the mail every week , five dollars , ten dollars , once twenty dollars . He wins clocks , bicycles , big cases of dog food . He won a trip to Washington , D.C. ; when he told them he was a cripple they sent him the money . But that is not all . " She pointed to her forehead . " He is very smart . He makes up puzzles for the papers . Papers in Boston and New York pay him to send them puzzles  --  arithmetic puzzles , joke puzzles , chess puzzles . And now something new has happened . He has invented a new kind of puzzle . I do not understand it . He makes patterns of words that go up and down . Sindacatos want to buy them for the Sunday papers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ? "  | " I do n't know . " ( To her , sindaco meant a mayor or town magis-trate . ) " How much schooling has he had , signora ? " " He went through grammar school  --  always top of his class . But the High School has stone steps . He goes to school in his little wagon , but he did not want the boys to carry him up and down those big steps twenty times a day . The boys like him very much ; everybody loves Benjy . But he is very independent . Do you know what he did ? He wrote to the Department of Education at Providenceto send him the lessons and examinations that they have for students in hospitals  --  for TB students and paralyzed students . And he passed High School , top of his class . They send him a d i ploma with a note from the Governor ! " " Wonderful ! " " Yes , God is good to us ! " she said and burst out laughing . She had long steeled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something . " Does Benjamino want to go to college ? " " No . He says he can do studies by himself now . " " Why does he want to read Dante ? " " Mr. Nort ' , I think he has played a trick on me . I think he knew all the time that you were the Mr. Nort ' in this advertisement . I think he liked the way you talked to him . He has many friends  --  school friends , teachers , his priest ; but he says they all talk to him as if he were a cripple . I think he thought you knew he had no feet , but you did not talk to him as if he were a cripple . The others pat him on the back and make loud jokes . He says they do n't talk to him natural . Maybe you talked to him natural . " She lowered her voice . " Please do not tell him that you did not know he had this trouble . " " I wo n't . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people who 've had accidents  --  about why God sends accidents to some people and not to other people . " " Signora , tell Benjamino that I am not a Dante scholar . The study of Dante is a vast subject to which hundreds of men havep224devoted a whole lifetime . Dante is full of theology  --  full of it . I know very little theology . I 'd be ashamed . A brilliant boy like your son would ask me questions every minute that I could n't answer . " Signora Matera looked stricken . I ca n't endure calling forth a stricken look on an Italian mother 's face . " Signora , what time do you all go to church on Sunday ? " " The seven o'clock Mass . We have to sell the Sunday papers at eight-thirty . " " I have a Sunday morning appointment at a quarter before eleven . Would it be inconvenient if I came and sat with Benjamino at nine o'clock ? " " Grazie ! Grazie ! " " No lesson . No money . Just talk . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buying their Boston or Providence Sunday papers . Rosa slipped out of line and led me through the door connecting the store with the house . Finger on her lip , she pointed to the door of her brother 's room . I knocked . " Come in , please . " His room was as small and neat as a ship 's cabin . He was sitting cross-legged on some pillows at the head of his bed . He was wearing a trim sea-captain 's coat with silver buttons . Across his knees was a drawing-board ; this was also his workroom . A carpenterhad built shelves on three sides of the room , including those at his right and left within reach of his long arms . I saw dictionaries and other works of reference and piles of paper ruled with grid lines for the making of puzzles . Benjy was a very handsome fellow , his large head covered with curly brown hair and his face lit up by his Saracen-Italian eyes and the Matera smile . But for his accidenthe would have been an unusually tall man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impression of his being older than he was . For me there was an armchair at the foot of the bed . " Buon giorno , Ben jamino ! " " Buon giorno , prof essore ! "  | " Are you disappointed that we are n't going to read Dante ? " He made no answer , but continued smiling . " I thought of Dante yesterdaymorning . I drove out to Brenton 's Point on my bicycle to see the sunrise . AndL'alba vinceva l'ora mattutina , che ' fuggia innanzi , si che di lontano conobbi ii tremolar della marina . Do you know where Dante says that ? " " At the beginning of the Purgatorio . " I was taken aback . " Benj amino , everybody around here calls you Benjy . That sounds a little too street-corner and ordinary for you . May I have your permission to call you Mino ? " He nodded . " Do you know of anyone else who was called Mino ? " " Mino da Fiesole . " " What was ' Mino ' probably short for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Benjamino . " " Do you know what Benjamin means in Hebrew ? " " Son of the right hand . ' " " Mino , this is beginning to sound like a classroom examination . We must stop that . But I do want to go back to Dante for a moment . Did you ever take the trouble to learn any passages in Dante by heart ? " The reader may think this was reprehensible on my part , but one of the rewards of being a teacher is watching a brilliant student display his knowledge . It is like putting a promising young racehorsethrough his paces . A good student enjoys it . Mino said , " Not very much  --  just the famous passages , like Paolo and Francesca or La Pia and some others . " " When Count Ugolino was locked up in the Tower of Famine with his sons and grandsons , without food , and days and days went by  --  what do you think that much-disputed verse means : ' Poscia , piu che ' 1 dolor , pote it digiuno ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How would you translate it ? "  | " ' Then . . . hunger . . . had more power than ... grief . ' " " What do you think we are to understand ? " " He . . . ate them . " " Many distinguished scholars , especially in the last century , think it means ' I died of hunger which was even stronger than my grief . ' What makes you think as you do ? " Suddenly his expression became one of passionate intensity . " Becausethe whole passage is full of that . The son says to his father , ' You gave us this flesh ; now take it back ! ' And all the time he is talking  --  in all that ice at the bottom of Hell  --  he is gnawing the back of his enemy 's neck . " " I think you 're right , Mino . The nineteenth-century scholars refused to face the cruel truth . The Divine Comedy was translated in Cambridge , Massachusetts , by Charles Eliot Norton and again by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ London ; they refused to see it as you do . It should teach us that Anglo-Saxons and Protestants have always misunderstood your country . They 've wanted the sweetness without the iron  --  without the famous Italian terribilita . Evasion , shrinking from the whole of life . Have n't you found people pretending that you never had an accident ? " He gazed at me earnestly , but made no answer . I smiled . He smiled . I laughed . He laughed . " Mino , what do you miss most because of the accident to your feet ? " " That I ca n't go to dances . " He blushed . We both burst out laughing . " If you 'd lost your eyesight , what would you have missed most ? " He thought a minute and replied , " Seeing faces . " " Not reading ? " " There are substitutes for reading ; there are no substitutes for not seeing faces . " " Damn it , Mino ! Your mother was right . It 's too bad about your feet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Now , reader , I know what he wanted to talk about , you knowp227what he most wanted to talk about ( at two dollars an hour ) , and I suspect that his mother knew what he most wanted to talk about  --  there had been a certain emphasis in her report of his complaint that the boys and men he knew did not talk to him " natural . " By what appears to be a coincidence ( but the older I grow , the less surprised I am by what are called coincidences ) I came to this interview with ' Mino prepared  --  armed  --  with a certain amount of experience acquired five years previously . The following recall of this experience in 1921 is no idle digression : When I was discharged from the Army ( having defended , unopposed , this very same Narragansett Bay ) I returned to continue my education ; then I got a job teaching at the Raritan School in New Jersey . In those days at no great distance from the school there was a veterans ' hospital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staff of nurses and recreation directors . Ladies in the neighboring towns volunteered their services in the latter department  --  and stout-hearted ladies they were , for it is no easy thing to enter suddenly into a world of four hundred men , most of whom have lost one or more limbs . They played checkers and chess with the men ; they gave lessons in the mandolin and guitar ; they organized classes in watercolor painting , public speaking , amateur theatricals , and glee club singing . But the volunteer workers fell all too short . Those four hundred men had nothing to do for fifteen hours a day but to play cards , torment the nurses , and to conceal from one another their dread of the future that lay before them . Moreover there were few male volunteers ; American men were back at home from war , hard at work , picking up their interrupted lives . And naturally no man would willingly enter that jungle of frantic wounded men unless he had himself been a soldier . So the superintendent of the hospital sent out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearby counties asking for ex-military volunteers to assist the recreation director . Transportationwould be provided . A number of us from the Raritanp228School ( including T. T. North , corporal , Coast Artillery , retired ) piled into a weapons-carrier and rattled off thirty miles to the hospitalon Monday mornings and Friday afternoons . " Gentlemen , " said the recreation director , " a lot of these fellows think they want to learn journalism . They think they can earn a million dollars by selling their war experiences to the Saturday Evening Post . Some do n't want to think about the War ; they want to write and sell Wild West stories or cops-and-robbers stories . Most of them never got out of high school . They ca n't write a laundry list .... I 'm dividing you volunteers into sections . Each of you has twelve men . They 've signed up eagerly ; you do n't have to worry about that . Your classes are called Journalism and Writing for Money ! They 're eager enough , but let me prepare you for one thing : their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes they have a chance to talk . Most of them are real nice fellows : you wo n't have any trouble with discipline . But they 're haunted by fear of the future . If you finally get their confidence you 'll get an earful . Now I 'm going to talk frankly to you men : they think they can never get a girl to marry them ; they 're afraid they ca n't even get a whore to sleep with them . They think most of the outside world looks on them as sort of eunuchs . Most of them are n't , of course , but one of the effects of amputation is the fancy that they 've been castrated . In one ward or another every night someone wakes up screaming in a nightmare about that . All they think about , really , is sex , sex , sex  --  and just as desperately : the prospect of being dependent all their lives on others . So every fifteen minutes take a conversation-break . Your real contribution here is to let them blow off steam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the night they use foul language to one another  --  New York smut , Kentucky smut , Oklahoma smut , California smut . That 's understandable , is n't it ? We have a rule here ; if they talk like that within the hearing of the nurses or the padres or you volunteers , they 're penalized . They get their cigarette allowance cut or they ca n't get their daily swim in the pool or they ca n't gop229to the movie show . I wish you 'd cooperate with us in this matter . You 'll get their respect by being severe with them , not easy . Give them an assignment . Tell them you want an article or a story or a poem from each one of them when you return a week from today . Miss Warriner will now lead you to your tables in the gym . Thank you , gentlemen , for coming . " " Mino , I think it 's great the way you struck out for yourself and are on the way to making yourself self-supporting  --  first solving the puzzles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened ? " " I began doing them when I was about twelve . Schoolwork was n't very hard so I used to read a lot . Rosa would bring me hooks from the library . " " What kind of books then ? " " I thought then that I 'd be an astronomer , but I began that too early . I was n't ready for the mathematics . I am now . Later I wanted to be a priest . Of course I could n't , but I read a lot of theology and philosophy . I did n't understand all of it , but . . . that 's when I learned a lot of Latin . " " Could n't you find anyone to talk those things over with ? " " I like to figure things out by myself . " " Hell , you wanted to read Dante with me . " He blushed and murmured , " That 's different . . . then I began doing puzzles to make money to buy books . " " Show me some puzzles that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reach of his hand were like those in a linen closet . He drew out a sheaf of leaves ; the puzzles were written with India ink on art paper . " Opus elegantissimum , juvenis ! " I said . " Do you get a lot of pleasure out of this ? " " No . I get pleasure out of the money . " I lowered my voice . " I remember my first paycheck . It was like a kick in the pants . It 's the beginning of manhood . Your mother told me you were inventing some new things . "  | " I have designs for three new games for adults . Do you know Mr. Aldeburg ? " " No . " " He 's a lawyer in town . He 's helping me take out patents for them . The whole field of puzzles and games is full of crooks . They 're crazy for new ideas and they 'd steal anything . " I leaned back . " Mino , what are the three most important things you want to do when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward another shelf and brought out a manufacturer'scatalogue  --  hospital equipment , wheelchairs for invalids . He opened it and held a page toward me : a rolling chair , propelledby a motor , nickel-plated , with a detachable awning for protection against rain , snow , or sun  --  a beauty . Two hundred and seventy-five dollars . I whistled . " And after that ? " Another catalogue . " I get fitted for some boots . They 're attached to my legs above and below the knee by a lot of straps . I 'd still have to use crutches , but my feet would n't swing . Through my legs I could put some of my weight on the ground . But I 'd have to use some kind of cane to prevent my falling on my face . I think I could invent something after I 'd got used to the boots . " Such was his mature control that he might have been talking about buying a car . But there was one element of confidence still lacking . I went right to the point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own apartment ? " " Yes , " he said surprised . " Where you can entertain your friends ? " " Yes , " he said and looked at me sharply to see if I had guessed what was in his mind . I smiled and repeated my question , holding his glance . The courage ebbed out of him and his eyes fell away . " Can I look over your books , Mina ? " " Sure . " I rose and turned to the shelves behind me . The books were all second-hand and appeared to have suffered long use  --  longer than his life . If he had bought them in Newport he must have ran/sacked the same second-hand stores that I had come to know when I was " excavating " the Fifth City . Maybe he had ordered them from the catalogues of such dealers in the larger cities . On the bottom shelf were the Britannica ( eleventh ) , some atlases , star charts , and other large works of reference . The majority of the shelves were filled with works on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The margins were covered with notes in fine handwriting and in faded ink . " Are these notes yours ? " " No , but they 're very sharp . " " Where 's your Divina Commedia ? " He pointed to two shelves within his reach : the Summa , Spinoza , the Aeneid , the Pensees of Pascal , Descartes .. . " You read French ? " " Rosa 's crazy about French . We play chess and go and parcheesi in French . " I had been thinking of Elbert Hughes . So there was another half-genius in Newport ; maybe a genius . Maybe a late blooming of the Fifth City . I remembered having heard that in Concord , Massachusetts , almost a century before , groups used to devote an evening to reading aloud in Italian or Greek or German , or even in Sanskrit . In Berkeley , California , my mother used to read Italian aloud with Mrs. Day on one evening in the week and French with Mrs. Vincent on another . She attended German classes at the University ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had learned some German in two successive German schools in China . It was on the tip of my tongue to ask Mino if he had any wish to go to either of the two universities nearby . I saw that his rigorousindependence not only forbade his relying on others to help him move about from place to place , but that his deprivation had shaped his mind toward becoming an autodidact . ( " I like to figure things out by myself . " ) I remembered how the father of Pascal had come upon the young boy reading with delight the First Book of Euclid . The father had other plans for his son 's education . He took away the volume , scarcely begun , and shut the boy in hisp232room ; but Pascal wrote the rest of the book himself , deducing the properties of the rectangle and the triangle , as a silkworm producessilk from his own entrails . But in the case of Mino I was saddened . In the twentieth century it is not possible to advance far as an autodidact in the vast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solitary men  --  and in later years discovered others  --  who , having early repudiated formal education , were writing a History of the Human Intelligence or The Sources of Moral Values . I sat down again . " Mino , have you seen any girls you like lately ? " He looked at me as though I 'd struck him or ridiculed him . I continued looking at him and waited . " No ... I do n't know any girls . " " Oh , yes you do ! Your sister brings some of her friends here to see you . " He could n't or did n't deny it . " Did n't I see you talking to one of those assistant librarians in the magazine room at the People 's Library ? " He could n't or did n't deny it . At last he said , " They do n't take me seriously . " " What do you mean , they do n't take you seriously ? " " They talk for a minute , but they 're in a hurry to get away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to do : start taking their clothes off ? " His hands were trembling . He put them under his buttocks and continued to stare at me . " No . " " You think they do n't talk naturally to you . I 'll bet you do n't talk naturally to them . A fine-looking young man like you , with top-quality first-rate brains . I 'll bet you play your cards wrong . " There was a breathless silence . His panic was contagious , but I plunged on . " Sure , you have a handicap , but the handicap is n't as bad as you think it is . You build it up in your imagination . Be yourself , Mino ! Lots of men with a handicap as bad as yours have settled down and got married and had kids . Do you want to know how I know this personally ? " " Yes . "  |p233I  told him about the veterans ' hospital . I ended up almost shouting , " Four hundred men in wheelchairs and wagons . And some of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their family  --  their own new family around them . Especially on Christmascards . I have n't got any of them in Newport , but I 'll send home for some to show you . But , Mino , understand this : they 're older than you . Most of them were older than you when they were wounded . What the hell are you so impatient about ? The trouble with you is that you 're building up an anxiety about the years ahead ; you 've got 1936 and 1946 planted in your head as though they were tomorrow . And the other trouble with you is that you want the Big Passionate Bonfire right now . A man ca n't live without female companionship , you 're damn right about that . But do n't spoil it , do n't ruin it by building up a lot of steam too early . Begin with friendship . Now listen : the Misses Laughlins ' Scottish Tea Room is just eight doors from your father 's door . Have you ever eaten there ? " He shook his head . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rosa . I 'm inviting you and some girl you know to lunch with me next Saturday noon . " " I do n't know any girl well enough to ask . " " Well , if you do n't bring a girl to lunch on Saturday , I 'll clam up on the whole matter . It 'll always be a pleasure to me to come and call on you and talk about Sir Isaac Newton and Bishop Berkeley  --  I 'm very sorry to see that you have n't got any of his works on your shelves  --  but I 'll never open my damn mouth on the subject of girls again . We 'll just pretend we 're eunuchs . My idea was that you ask one girl this Saturday with the three of us  --  just to break the ice  --  and that the following Saturday you ask another girl , all by yourself . I guess you can afford it , ca n't you ? They serve a very good seventy-five-cent blue-plate lunch . You were ready to throw away sixteen dollars on some lousy Dante @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give another party and you bring still a different girl . " A terrible struggle was going on within him . " The only girls I know . . . I know a little . . . are twin sisters . "  | " Great ! Are they lively ? " " Yes . " " What 's their name ? " " Avonzino  --  Filumena and Agnese . " " Which do you like better ? " " They 're just the same . " " Well , Saturday you sit by Agnese and I 'll bring a friend of mine to sit by Filumena . You know what Agnese means in Greek , do n't you ? " He made no sign . " It comes from hagne  --  pure , chaste . ' So put the damper on those lascivious ideas of yours . Keep calm . Just a pleasant get-together . Just talking about the weather and about those puzzles of yours . We 'll give the girls a big thrill talking about your new inventions and patents . Is it a deal ? " He nodded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? " He shook his head . " Remember this : Lord Byron had to strap up his misshapen foot in complicated boots and half the girls in Europe were crying their eyes out for him . Put that in your pipe and smoke it . What does King Oedipus 's name mean ? " " Swell-foot . " " And who did he marry ? " " His mother . " " And what was the name of that splendid daughter of his ? " " Antigone . " I burst out laughing . Mino managed a hesitant laugh . I continued , " I 've got to go now . Shake hands , Mino . I 'll see you next Sunday at this time ; but first I 'll see you next Saturday at twelvethirtyat the Scottish Tea Room . Wear just what you 're wearing now and be ready to have a good time .

He may need a little help from you , but leave as much of it to him as you can .  --  Signora Matera , you have the brightest boy on AquidneckIsland . " " Datt'a wot I tole you !

" On Saturday morning I dropped in at the Tea Room and had a word or two with my esteemed and straight-backed friend Miss Ailsa Laughlin . " There 'll be six of us , Miss Ailsa . Can we have the round table in the corner ? " " We never hold reservations , Mr. North . You know that . Five minutes late and you must take your chances with the other guests . " " When I listen to you , Miss Ailsa , I have to close my eyes  --  just to listen to that Highland music . " " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Laughlins were neighbors of Robbie Burns . " " Music , perfect music . We 'll be here exactly at twelve-thirty . What is being offered ? " " You know perfectly well that on Saturday noons in summer we have shepherd 's pie . " " Ah , yes , agneau en crate . Kindly convey my shy admiration to Miss Jeannie . " " She wo n't believe it , Mr. North . She thinks you 're a fickle deceiver . You and Miss Flora Deland behaving scandalously in our house ! " We are all prompt , but the Materas were promptest . They arrivedfive minutes early so that we did not see Mino rise from his rolling chair , adjust his crutches , and swing himself into the Tea Room  --  Rosa 's hand in the small of his back as leverage . I arrived just in time to seat them . Rosa was the kind of girl who appears more attractive at each successive meeting ; happiness casts a spell . Mr. Stams and the Avonzino girls followed immediately . Filumenap237and Agnese were bafflingly identical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duplication . They were enchantingly and even alarmingly dressed . Rosa , who sat at my right , informed me that they were wearing the dresses and hats which they had made themselvesfrom a Butterick pattern , five years before , to serve as bridesmaids at an older sister 's wedding . These were of tangerine organdy and they had " built " wide-brimmed hats of the same material , stretched on fine wire . When they went down a crowded street passers-by formed two hedge-rows to watch them . Each had embroidered the initial of her first name over her heart to help us to identify her . Agnese wore a wedding ring . Her name was Mrs. Robert O'Brien ; her husband , a naval warrant officer , had been drowned at sea three years before . I made the introductions . " We 're all going to call one another by our Christian names . Beside me is Rosa ; next is Bodo  --  he is from Austria ; next is Agnese ; next is Mino , who is Rosa 's brother ; next is Filumena . Bodo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They 're all such beautiful names , except mine , that I 'm ashamed . But we are Theophilus , Rosa , poor old Bodo , Agnese , Mino , Filumena . " He was applauded . It was a warm day . We began the meal with a glass of Welch 's grape juice with a " scoop " of lemon sherbet in it ( ten cents extra ) . Two of my guests  --  Mino and Bodo  --  were intimidated , but the twins were raving beauties and knew that everything would be permitted them . " Bodo , " said Filumena , " I like your name . It sounds like the name of a very nice dog . And you look like a very nice dog . " " Oh , thank you ! " " Agnese , would n't it be nice if we could build a big kennel in our back yard and Bodo could live with us and keep naughty men away . Mamma would love you , Bodo , and feed you very well . " " And , " said Agnese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around your neck and we 'd go for walks on the Parade . " Bodo barked happily , nodding his head up and down . Agnese continued , " But Mamma loves Mino best , so you must n't be jealous , Bodo . Mamma loves Mino because he knows everything . She told him the date of her birth and he looked up at the ceiling a moment and said That was a Monday . ' Papa asked him why a leap-year comes every four years and Mino made it as clear to him as two-times-two-makes-four . " I said , " Mino has given me permission to tell you a secret about him . " " Mino 's going to get married ! " cried Filumena . " Of course , Mino 's going to get married . So are we all , but Mino 's too young yet . No , the secret is that he 's getting out patents for some games he 's invented and they 're going to sweep the country like mahjong . They 're going to be in every home like parcheesi and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Oh ! " cried the girls . " But you are n't going to forget us , are you , Mino ? " " No , " said Mino , dazed . " You are n't going to forget that we loved you before you were rich ? " " Another secret , " I announced . " He 's started inventing a practicalboot so that he can climb mountains and go skating  --  and dance ! " Applause and cheers . The shepherd 's pie was delicious . Agnese said to Mino , " And you 're going to give Bodo some beautiful dog biscuits , and you 're going to give Filumena a sewing machine that does n't break down all the time ? " " And , " continued Filumena , " you 're going to give Agnese some singing lessons with Maestro del Valle , and you 're going to give your sister a turquoise pin because she was born in July . What are you going to give Theophilus ? "  | " I know what I want , " I said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first Saturday in August , 1927  --  the same place , the same people , the same things to eat , the same friendships . " Bodo said " Amen " ; everybody said " Amen " and Mino added " I will . " Now we were eating prune whip . The conversation became less general . While I was talking to Rosa Bodo was asking Agnese about her interest in singing . All I was able to overhear was the name of Mozart . Bodo was suggesting to her a riddle that she was to put to Mino . He did not tell her the answer . " Mino , " she said , " you must answer this riddle : what connection is there between the names of our host today and the composer I love best , Mozart ? " Mino looked up at the ceiling a moment and then smiled . " Theophilus is one who loves God in Greek and Amadeus is one who loves God in Latin . " Applause and delighted wonder , especially mine . " Bodo told me to ask you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it well , " added Bodo . " Sometimes he would sign his middle name in Greek or in Latin or in German . What would the German be , Mino ? " " I do n't know much German , but ... Liebe . . . and Gott  --  oh , I have it : Gottlieb . " More applause . Miss Ailsa had been standing behind me . The Scots love learning . Agnese addressed Mino again . " And does my name mean lamb ' ? " Mino shot a glance at me , but turned back to her . " It could come from that , but many people think it comes from an earlier word , from the Greek hagne that means ' pure . ' " Tears started to her eyes . " Filumena , please kiss Mino on the forehead for me . " " Indeed , I will , " said Filumena and did so . We were all a little exhausted by these surprises and wondersp240and fell silent while the coffee was placed before us . ( Five cents extra . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone who 's sitting over there in that corner . " " Hilary Jones !  --  Who 's he with ? " " That 's his wife . They 've come together again . She 's Italian , but she 's not Roman Catholic . She 's Italian and Jewish . She 's Agnese 's best friend too . We 're all best friends . Her name 's Rachele . " " How 's Linda ? " " She 's home with them . She 's out of the hospital . " When my guests took their leave ( Bodo whispering , " You should hear the conversation I 'm accustomed to at luncheon ! " ) I crossed and shook hands with Hill . " Teddie , I 'd like you to meet my wife , Rachele . " " Very happy to meet you , Mrs. Jones . How 's Linda ? " " She 's much better , much better . She 's at home with us now . " We talked about Linda and Hill 's summer job in the public playgrounds and about the Materas and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask you a question , Hill  --  and you , Mrs. Jones . I trust you not to think it 's just vulgar curiosity . I know that Agnese 's husband was drowned at sea . There must be many such widows in Newport , as there are all up and down the coast of New England . But I feel that she carries some particular burden  --  some additional burden . Am I right ? " They looked at one another in a kind of dismay . Hill said , " It was terrible . . . . Nobody talks about it . " " Forgive me . I 'm sorry I asked . " " There 's no reason you should n't know , " said Rachele . " We all love her . Everybody loves her . You do see why everybody loves her , do n't you ? " " Oh , yes . " " We all hope that that and her wonderful little boy and her singing  --  she sings beautifully , you know  --  will help her forget what happened . You tell Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you tell him , Rachele. "  | " He was on the crew of a submarine . It was way up in the north , like near Labrador . And the submarine struck a reef or something under the water and the machinery broke down . And the ice began to crush it . And the compartments got closed . They had air for a while , but they could n't get into the galley . . . . They had nothing to eat . " We all looked at one another in silence . " Airplanes were looking for them , of course . Then the ice moved away and they were found . Their bodies were brought back . Bobby 's buried in the Naval Cemetery on the Base . " " Thank you .  --  I 'm only free on Sunday afternoons . Can I call on you a week from tomorrow and see Linda ? " " Oh , yes . Please come to supper . " " Thank you , I ca n't stay to supper . Please write down your address , Hill . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Throughout the following week I met one or other of the Materas every noon when I picked up my New York paper . Italians , all of us . On Sunday morning I called on Mino at nine . " Buon giorno , Mino . " " Buon giorno , prof essore . " " Mino , I 'm not going to ask you if you kept your promise to invite a girl to lunch yesterday . I do n't want to hear a word about it . From now on that 's your business . What shall we talk about today ? " He was smiling with a more than usual air of " a man who knows where he 's going " and I was answered . Young people are eager to be made to talk about themselves and to hear themselves discussed , but there is a limit  --  as they approach twenty  --  beyond which they shrink from such talk . Their interest in themselves becomesall inward . So I asked , " What shall we talk about today ? " " Prof essore , will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " I spoke of the value of being required to devote yourself to subjectsthat at first seem foreign to your interests ; of the value ofp242being thrown among young men and young women of your own age , many of whom are as eager as you are to get the best of it ; of the possibility  --  it 's only luck  --  of being brought into contact with born teachers , even with great teachers . I reminded him of Dante 's request to his guide Virgil . " Give me the food for which you have already given me the appetite . " He was looking at me with urgent intensity . " Do you think I should go to college ? " " I 'm not ready to answer that question . You are a very remarkableyoung man , Mino . It is very possible that you have outgrown what an American university could give you . You have the appetite and you know where to find the food . You have triumphed over one handicap and the handicap was spur to the triumph . It may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lack of a formal higher education . " He lowered his voice and asked , " What do you think I lack most ? " I laughed and rose to go . " Mino , centuries ago a king in one of the countries near Greece had a daughter he loved very much . She seemed to be wasting away with some mysterious illness . So the old man journeyed to the great oracle at Delphi , bringing rich gifts , and asked the sibyl , What can I do to make my daughter well ? ' And the sibyl chewed the bay leaves and went into a trance and replied in verse , Teach her mathematics and music . ' Well , you have the mathematics all right , but I miss in you that music . " " Music ? " " Oh , I do n't mean what we call music . I mean the whole vast realm that 's represented by the Muses . You have your Dante  --  but the Divina Commedia and the Aeneid are the only works that I 've seen here that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , almost mischievously . " Was n't Urania the Muse of astronomy ? " " Oh , yes . I forgot her ; but I stick to my point . " He was silent a moment . " What do they do for us ? " I said briskly , " A school of the sympathies , of the emotions andp243passions , and of self-knowledge . Think it over . Mino , I ca n't come next Sunday morning , but I 'd like to be here the Sunday after that . Ave atque vale ! " At the door I turned and asked , " By the way , do Agnese 's son and Rachele 's Linda come to call on you here ? " " They come and see Rosa and my mother , but they do n't come to see me . " " Do you know much about the death of Agnese 's husband ? " " He was drowned at sea . That 's all I know . " He was blushing . I guessed that he had invited Agnese to lunch on the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Cultivate the Muses ! You are an Italian from Magna Graecia  --  you have probablylots of Greek blood in you also . Cultivate the Muses ! " In my journal , from which I am refreshing my memory of these encounters , I find that I was assembling a " portrait " of Mino , as of so many others in these pages . I come upon a hastily written notation : " Mino 's handicap involves restrictions I had not foreseen . Not only is he aware that people do not talk to him ' naturally , ' he has never received visits from the young children of his sister 's two best friends , and has probably not even seen them . The implicationis that the children would be affected ' morbidly ' by his accident . That consideration would not have arisen in Italy where the disfigured , the scrofulous , and the maimed are visible daily in the market-place  --  generally as beggars . Moreover , Mino seems not to have been told those details of Warrant Officer O'Brien 's death that had so distressed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his widow . In America the tragic background of life is hidden in cupboards , even from those who have come most starkly face to face with it . Should I some day point this out to Mino ? " On the following Sunday afternoon I called on Linda and her parents , carrying a small old-fashioned bouquet nestling in a lacepaperfrill . Hilary , reunited with his wife , had become familyproud , which is always an engaging thing to see . Rachele 's familyp244had come from the north of Italy , from the industrial region near Turin where girls of the working classes are brought up to enter the widening field of office workers and , when possible , to become schoolteachers . The little apartment was spotless and serious . Linda was still convalescent and a little wan , but delighted to receive company at tea . I was surprised to see what used to be called a " cottage piano " or a " yacht piano , " lacking an octave at the upper range and an octave in the bass . " Do you play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She plays very well . She 's very popular at the boys ' clubs ' rallies . She sings too . " " Usually on Sunday afternoon Agnese drops in with her Johnny . You do n't mind , do you ? " asked Rachele . " Oh , no , " I said . " I liked the Avonzino twins at once . Will you and Agnese sing for me ? " " We do sing duets . We each take two lessons a month from Maestro del Valle and he made us promise to sing every time anyone seriously asks us to . Are you serious , Theophilus ? " " Am I ! " " Then you 'll hear four of us . Our children have heard us practice so often at home that they know the music and sing with us . First we 'll sing alone , then we 'll sing again and they 'll join in . Please act as though it were a perfectly natural thing . We do n't want them to become self-conscious about it . " Presently Agnese arrived with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Johnny was a firehouse of energy at home , but like most fatherless small boys he was intimidated by two full-grown men . He sat wide-eyed by his mother . Agnese , apart from her vivacious sister , was subdued also . We talked about the lunch at the Scottish Tea Room and the glowing picture I had painted of Mino 's future . I assured them it was true . Agnese asked who Bodo was and what he " did . " I told them . All girls like one surprise a day . " Then it was shocking our talking about him as a dog . " " Oh , Agnese ! You could see how pleased he was . " When we 'd finished tea I asked the girls to sing to us . Theyp245exchanged a glance and Rachele went to the piano . Each mother turned to her child , put her finger to her lip and whispered , " Later . " They sang Mendelssohn 's " Oh , That We Two Were Maying . " Mino should have heard that . " Now we 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the children sang unabashed . I glanced at Hilary . So this was what he almost lost for Diana Bell ! Agnese said , " For a bazaar at my church we learned some parts of Pergolesi 's Stabat Mater . " They sang two terzets of that ; first alone , then with the children . Pergolesi should have heard that . Newport is full of surprises . I was learning that perhaps the Ninth City is nearer to the Fifth  --  perhaps to the Second  --  than any of the others . When we had taken our leave I walked to her house door with Agnese , hand in hand with Johnny . " You have a beautiful voice , Agnese . " " Thank you . " " I think that Maestro del Valle must have ambitious plans for you . " " He does . He has offered to give me regular lessons without fees . With my pension and my daily job I could pay for them , but I have no ambition . " " No ambition , " I repeated , meditatively . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No . " She murmured , " Johnny , music , and submission to the will of God . . . they . . . they hold me . " I ventured a very rash remark , still meditatively . " The War left behind many hundreds of thousands of young widows . " She answered quickly , " There are some aspects of my husband 's death that I can not talk about with anybody  --  not with Rosa or Rachele , not even with my mother or Filumena . Please , do n't . . . say ... " " Look , Johnny , do you see what I see ? "  | " What ? " I pointed . " A candy store ? " " Open on Sunday too ! When I went to call on Linda I took her a present . I did n't know that you were going to be there . Come up to the window and see what you 'd like . " It was what used to be called a " notions " store . In one corner of the window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Johnny began pointing , jumping up and down . " Look ! Look , Mr. North ! There 's a submarine , my daddy 's submarine . Can I have that ? " I turned to Agnese . She gave me a harrowed glance of appeal and shook her head . " Johnny , " I said , " today 's Sunday . When I was a boy my father never let us buy toys on Sunday . Sunday we went to church , but no games and no toys . " So I marched in and bought some chocolates . When we reached the Avonzino home , he said goodbye nicely and went into the house . Agnese stood with one hand on the swinging gate . She said , " I think you have urged Benjy  --  I mean , Mino  --  to ask me to lunch ? " " Before I ever knew that the Avonzino sisters existed , I urged him to bring any girl or girls he knew to the Scottish Tea Room . I then urged him to bring any girl , preferably a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the following Saturday . He said no word to me about inviting you . " " I have had to tell him that I can not accept such invitations again . I admire Mino , as we all do ; but weekly meetings in a public place like that are not suitable . . . . Theophilus , do not tell anyone what I am about to say : I am a very unhappy woman . I am not capable even of friendship . Everything is just play-acting . I shall be helped , I know "  --  and she pointed with forefinger from an otherwise motionless hand to the zenith  --  " but I must wait patiently for that . " " Please go on play-acting for Johnny 's sake . I do n't mean byp247going to lunches with Mino , but by seeing some of us in groups from time to time . I think Bodo is planning a kind of picnic , but his car can hold only four and I know he wants to see Mino and yourself again .... " She did not raise her eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I do not know your intolerable burden , Agnese ; but I do know that you do not wish it to be a shadow on Johnny 's life forever . " She looked at me , frightened ; then said abruptly , " Thank you for walking home with us . Oh , yes , I am happy to meet Mino anywhere when there are others in the company . " She put out her hand . " Goodbye . " " Goodbye , Agnese . " At seven o'clock I telephoned Bodo . You could always catch him dressing for some dinner party . " Griiss Gott , Herr Baron . " " Griiss Gott in Ewigkeit . " " What time is your dinner engagement tonight ? " " Eight-fifteen . Why ? " " When could I meet you in the Muenchinger-King bar to lay a plan before you ? " " Is seven-thirty too soon ? " " See you then . " Diplomats are punctual . Bodo was wearing what we used to call in college his " glad rags . " He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brass , " admirals of all nations  --  decorations ( known to the lower ranks as " fruit salad " ) and everything . Quite a sight ! " What 's your plan , old man ? " he asked with happy expectation . " Bodo , something very serious this time . I must talk fast . Do you know the Ugolino passage in Dante ? " " Naturally ! " " You remember Agnese ? Her husband was lost in a submarine at sea . " I told him the little I knew . " Maybe the men died of suffocation within a few days ; maybe they lived on for a weekp248without food . The boat was finally liberated from the ice . Do you suppose the Navy Department informed the widows and parents of the men of what they may have found ? " He thought a minute . " If it was appalling , I do n't think they did . " " The possibilities haunt Agnese . They are robbing her of the will to live . She does not suspect that I know what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " She tells me that she is filled with thoughts that she can not tell her sister , her best friends , or even her mother . When people say a thing like that it means that they are longing to tell them to someone . Mino has asked her to lunch several times since our party at the Scottish Tea Room . She tells me she can not accept any more invitations from him alone . Do n't you think Mino a fine fellow ? " " I certainly do . " " I want to give a sunset picnic at Brenton 's Point next Sunday . Are you free to come between five and eight ? " " I am . It is one of my last days in Newport . They 're giving a reception for me at nine-thirty . I can make it . " " I shall provide the champagne , the sandwiches , and the dessert . Will you , as a Knight of the Two-Headed Eagle , come with us and lend us your car ? You and Agnese and Mino will sit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rumble seat with the ice-bucket and the provisions . I do n't want to appear to be host . Will you be the ostensible host ? " " No ! For shame ! I shall be the host . Now I too must talk fast . In my guest house there are always bottles of champagne in the ice-box . I shall bring along a little portable kitchen with a hot dish . Any Swiss can open a hotel with one day 's notice ; we Austrianscan do it in a week . If it 's raining or cold we can go to my guest house . You have supplied the idea  --  that 's quite enough from you .  --  Now tell me your plan . What is the idea ? " " Oh , Bodo , do n't ask me . It 's only a hope . "  | " Oh ! Oh !  --  Give me a hint . " " Do you know Macbeth ? " " I played in it at Eton . I was Macduff . " " Do you remember Macbeth 's question to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wait !  --  ' Canst thou not . . . Pluck from the memory a rooted sorrow ... ? , and something about ' Cleanse the stuffed bosom of that perilous stuff Which weighs upon the heart ? ' " " Oh , Bodo !  --  That 's what will win you Persis ; that 's what we must do for Agnese . " He stared at me . He whispered , " Persis too ? Did her husband die in a submarine ? " " Only the happiness that is snatched from suffering is real ; all the rest is merely what they call ' creature comforts . ' " " Who said that ? " " One of your Austrian poets  --  Grillparzer , I think . " " Schon !  --  I must run . Send me a note about where to pick up my guests and all that . Ave atque vale . " The invitations were sent through Rosa and accepted . " Rosa , we would love to invite you and Filumena , too , but you know the size of his car . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stratagem . " Will you show me , Rosa , where you put your hand on Mino 's back to help him in and out of doorways and cars ? " Her mother watched us laughing . " I do'no w'at you are tinking now , Signor Teofilo , but I no afraid . " The great day arrived . The weather was perfect . Mino was seated in the car by skilled hands . Agnese preferred to be picked up at the Materas ' store , in order  --  I assumed  --  that her son 's disappointmentwould not be enhanced by his longing to accompany her on an automobile ride . When we arrived at Brenton 's Point that great hotel-man Baron Stams whisked out two portablep250service tables , spread them ( with a flourish ) with linen , and proceeded to uncork a bottle . Mino and Agnese remained in the car with trays on their laps while the other two cavaliers drew up besidethem on folding chairs . Mino said , " Now I can say that I 've tasted champagne twice . I 've tasted Asti Spumante at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ champagne before was at your wedding , Agnese . " " You were only fifteen then , Mino . I 'm glad you did . " She spoke like someone treading on ice . " My husband 's family live in Albany , New York . They came and stayed at our house . They brought three bottles of champagne . . . . Do you remember Robert well , Mino ? " " I certainly do . His boat did n't come in to the Bay often , but he once asked me if I wanted to go on board and , of course , I was crazy to . But on that day there was a big storm blowing up and I could n't have managed the ladders and the gangway . He told me he 'd take me another time . He was my idol . My mother thought he was the handsomest man she 'd ever seen  --  and the nicest . " Agnese looked about her distraught . Bodo asked , " Did the Navy give him special leave for the wedding ? " " Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went to New York . We saw everything . We took a different El and a different subway to the end of the line every day . Robert knew that I loved music , so we went to the opera three times . " She turned to Mino and looked up into his face . " Of course , we had to sit way up high , but we could see and hear everything perfectly . And we went to the zoo and to Mass at St. Patrick 's . " There were tears in her eyes , but she added with a little laugh , " We went to Coney Island too . That was fun , Mino . " " Yes , Agnese . " " Yes . . . Theophilus , what is Bodo doing ? " Bodo was busy over a chafing-dish . " I 'm cooking supper , Agnese . It wo n't be ready for a while so have another glass of champagne . "  | " I 'm afraid that it 'll make me tipsy . " " It 's not very strong . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maestro del Valle given you any songs that you can sing without piano accompaniment ? You know he wants you to sing if anyone asks you seriously . I can promise you we 're all serious . " " Well , there 's an old Italian song . . . . Let me recall it a minute . " She put her hand over her eyes and then sang " Caro mio Ben , Caro mio Ben , " as purely as a swan gliding over the water . In the second verse she broke down . " I 'm sorry I ca n't go on . That was one of the three songs he loved best . . . . Oh , Theophilus , oh , Bodo . . . he was such a good man ! He was just a boy really and he loved life so much . Then that dreadful thing happened to him  --  under the ice , without food . I suppose they had water , did n't they ? . . . but nothing to eat ... " Bodo started speaking , distinctly but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Agnese , during the War I lay in a ditch for four days without food . I was so wounded that I could not get up to look for water . I kept losing consciousness . When the doctors found me they said that I had died several times , but that I was smiling . You can be sure that the men in the boat  --  with so little air  --  lost consciousness . Air is more important than even food and water . " She stared at him startled , a gleam of hope . She put her hand to her throat and murmured , " No air . No air . " Then she threw her arms about Mino ; she laid her cheek on the lapel of his coat and sobbed , " Mino , comfort me ! Comfort me ! " He put his arm around her and repeated , " Dear Agnese , beautifulAgnese . . . dear Agnese , brave Agnese ... " " Comfort me ! " Bodo and I stared at one another . Suddenly Agnese collected herself , saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and drew a handkerchief from her handbag . Bodo said loudly , " Supper 's ready . "  |p252During  my earlier stay in Newport  --  at Fort Adams in 1918 and 1919  --  I had belonged to the Fourth City , that of the military and naval establishments . In this summer of 1926 there was little likelihood  --  nor did I seek any  --  that I would have any contact with those self-sufficient enclosures . Yet I did come to know and delight in one very humble memberby-allianceof the United States Navy  --  Alice . From time to time I am overcome by a longing for an Italian meal . I had received invitations to dinner at the homes of the Materas , the Avonzinos , and the Hilary Joneses , where I was promised an Italian meal ; but the reader knows of my resolve to accept no invitations whatever . My life was so gregarious and fragmented that only a strict adherence to that rule could save me from something approaching breakdown . I ate alone . There were three restaurants in Newport purporting to be Italian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offered sorry imitations of true Italian cooking . My favorite was " Mama Carlotta 's " at One Mile Corner . There one was able to obtain , in a teacup , a home-grownp253wine popularly called " dago red . " About once in two weeks I wheeled the mile to " Mama Carlotta 's " and ordered the minestrone , the fettuccine con salsa , and the bread ; the bread was excellent . This restaurant was across the road from one of the half-dozen entrances to the vast high-fenced Naval Base . It adjoined the many acres of barracks  --  six apartments to a house  --  in which lived the families of sailors many of whom worked at the Base , the majority of whom were often absent for many months at a time . Ulysses , King of Ithaca , was separated from his wife Penelope for twenty years  --  ten of them fighting on the plains before Troy , ten of them on the long voyage home . These men in Newport , their wives and children , lived in a densely crowded area of identicaldwellings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conventions . Since 1926 the area has grown many times in size , but with the increase of air travel home leave is granted more frequently and even the families are transported for a time to similar " compounds " in Hawaii , the Philippines , and elsewhere . In 1926 there were hundreds of " shore widows . " Density of population increases irritability , lonesomeness , and a censorious view of the behavior of others , all exacerbated at that time by walled enclosure . Penelope 's was a hard lot and she must have been surrounded by the wives of absent seamen , but at least , being a queen , not every moment of her daily life was exposed to the eyes of women as unhappy as herself . Residents on the Naval Base were permitted to leave the enclosureat will , but they seldom ventured into the town of Newport  --  they had their own provision stores , their own theaters , clubhouses , hospitals , doctors , and dentists . Civilian life did not interestand perhaps intimidated them . But they enjoyed escaping briefly from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " ghetto " to certain locations outside the walls . " Mama Carlotta 's " was one of a group of restaurants and licit bars at One Mile Corner that they felt to be theirs . It consisted of two large parallel rooms , the bar and the restaurant . The bar was alwaysp254crowded with men , though there were tables for ladies ( who never came singly ) ; the restaurant at noon and evening was generallywell filled . The naval families seldom spent money for meals away from home , but occasionally when parents and relatives arrived for a visit they were offered the treat of a meal off the Base . A warrant officer or a chief petty officer came here , out into the world , to celebrate an anniversary . It is proverbial among the other services that professional seamen , from admirals down , marry good-looking women , not conspicuously intelligent , and that they find them in our southern states . I was able to confirm this rash generalization over and over again , notably at " Mama Carlotta 's . " Early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my apartment , I was enjoying a meal at " Mama Carlotta 's . " It was my custom to read a paper or even a book at table . The fact that I was alone and reading was sufficient to mark me a landlubber . On this evening for reasons unknown I could not be served with wine and was drinking Bevo . I sat alone and exposed at a table for four , though the crowd was so great that the feminine portion of it had overflowed from the bar into the restaurant where it stood , two by two , glass in hand , engaged in animated conversation . This chapter is about Alice . I never knew her married name . During the few hours I saw her I learned that she came from a large , often starving , family in the coal-mining region of West Virginia and that she had run away from home at the age of fifteen with a gentleman-friend . I shall not attempt to reproduce her accent nor to indicate fully the limitations of her education . Alice and her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touching two of the empty chairs at my table . They were talking to be seen talking  --  not for my benefit only , but for the benefit of the public . Almost everyone in the room knew everyone else in the room and was keeping watch on everyone else in the room . As an author of a later day has said , " Hell is they . " I havep255unusually sharp hearing and became aware of an alteration in their tone . They had lowered their voices and were debating whether it would be " out of place " to ask me if they could sit in the empty chairs at my table . Presently the elder , Delia , turned to me and asked with chilly impersonality if the seats were taken . I half-rose and said , " No , indeed , ladies . Please sit down . " " Thank you . " I was to learn later that even my partially rising from my chair was positively exciting . In the circles where they moved men did not under any occasion rise to acknowledge the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the movies , hence the excitement . I resumed my reading and lit a pipe . They turned their chairs face to face and continued their conversation in their earlier manner . They were discussing the election of a friend to the chairmanship of a committee responsible for supervising a charity bingo tournament . I had the sensation of listening to a scene from one of those old-fashioned plays wherein  --  for the audience 's benefit  --  two characters inform one another of events long known to each of them . It went on for some time . Delia was pointing out that it was ridiculous that a certain Dora had been elected . Dora , in a former high office , had made a perfect mess of organizing a farewell teapartyfor a couple transferred to Panama ; and so on . " She tries to make herself popular by telling fortunes frompalm-reading . Do you know what she told Julia Hackman ? " " No . " Some whispering . " Alice ! You made that up ! " " Cross my heart to die . " " Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) " She 'll do anything to get talked about . She said there was a Peeping Tom outside her bathroom ; she opened the window suddenly and threw a soapy wet sponge in his face  --  in his eyes . " " Alice ! That 's not true . " " Delia , that 's what she says . She 'll say anything to get famous . That 's the way she gets votes . Everybody knows her name . " I had now the opportunity to observe them surreptitiously.  |p256Delia  was the taller , dark and handsome , but discontented and even embittered ; I took her to be about thirty . Alice was scarcely over five feet , about twenty-eight years old . She had a pretty , birdlike , pointed face , of a pallor that suggested ill-health . Under her hat some wisps of lusterless straw-colored hair could be seen . But all was rendered vivid by dark intelligent eyes and an almost breathless eagerness to extract enjoyment from life . Her drawbacks were two : her native intelligence led her into a constant irritation with those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an unprepossessingfigure which , like her pallor , was probably the result of malnutrition in childhood . In spite of the difference in their ages Alice exerted an ascendancy over her friend . They emptied their glasses . Almost without raising my eyes I spoke to them in a low voice : " May I offer the ladies a glass of beer ? " Each stared into the other 's face , frozen  --  as though they had heard something that can not be repeated . Neither looked at me . Having established the audacity of my overture , Delia assumed the responsibility of answering me . Without smiling , she lowered her head and murmured , " That 's very kind of you . " I arose and gave a barely audible order to the waiter and returned to my book . Convention ! Convention ! That rigorous governor of every human assembly , from the Vatican to the orphanage sandpile , is particularlysevere on " shore widows , " for a sailor 's advancement is also conditioned by his wife 's behavior . We were being observed . We were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The important thing was to give no impression that we were enjoying ourselves  --  for envy plays a large part in censorious morality . When the glasses were placed before them the girls nodded slightly and resumed their conversation . But before I returned to my reading Alice 's eyes met mine  --  those superb dark eyes in the body of that early-aging hedge-sparrow . Quicksilver began coursing through my veins.  |p257After  a few minutes I ostentatiously spilled some of my beer on the table  --  " I beg your pardon , ladies , " I said , mopping up the beer with my handkerchief . " Excuse me . I 'd better have my eyes examined . Have I spilled any on you ? " " No . No . " " I 'd never forgive myself , if I 'd spilled anything on your dresses . " I pretended to dry the hem of my jacket . " I have a scarf here , " said Delia . " It 's an old thing . Use it . It 'll wash out easily . " " Thank you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I should n't read in a place like this . It 's bad for the eyes . " " Oh , yes , " said Alice . " My father used to read all the time  --  at night , too . It was terrible . " " I 'd better put my book away . I sure need my eyes every minute of the day . " We were solemn enough to satisfy the severest critics . Alice asked , " Do you live in Newport ? " " Yes , ma'am . Seven years ago in the War I was stationed at Fort Adams . I liked the place and I came back here to find work . I work on the grounds of one of the places . " " On the grounds ? " " I 'm a kind of handyman  --  furnaces , leaves , cleaning up the place  --  like that . " In the services " cleaning up the place " denotes a form of punishmentthat resembles chain-gang labor ; but they had decided that I was a civilian and were merely confused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place you work at ? " " No , I live alone in a little apartment just off Thames Street  --  not really alone because I have a big dog . My name is Teddie . " " A dog ? Oh , I love dogs . " " We 're not allowed to keep dogs on the Base . " I invented the dog . There 's an American myth , diffused by the movies , that a man who keeps a big dog and smokes a pipe is all right . Things were going very fast . What had not yet been con/veyed was which girl I liked best . Alice and I knew , but Delia was not markedly bright . " Would you ladies like to be my guests at the nine o'clock show at the Opera House ? After the show I could bring you back here in a taxi . " " Oh , no ... Thank you . " " It 's far too late . " " Oh , no ! " I could swear on a pile of Bibles that Delia pushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoe according to some prearranged code . Delia said , " You go , Alice . We could leave here together and the gentleman could meet you later up the street a ways . " Alice was horrified . " How could you think of such a thing , Delia ! " " Well , " said Delia , rather grandly , rising . " Thoughts are free . I 'm going to the little girls ' room . Excuse me . I 'll be back in a minute . " Alice and I were left alone . " I think you 're from the South , " I said with the first smile of the evening . She did not smile ; in fact , she glared at me . She put her head forward and began speaking in a low voice , but very distinctly . " Do n't smile ! In a few minutes I have to introduce you to some of the girls . I 'm going to pretend that you 're a doctor , so be ready  --  I 'd better say that you 're an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Panama ? " " No . " " In Norfolk , Virginia ? " " No . " " Well , where have you been all your life ? I 'll say Norfolk ... . Delia ca n't go downtown because her husband 's coming back next week and she do n't dare go anywhere . Stop smiling ! This is a serious conversation . When Delia and I leave here you say goodbye to us . Then five minutes later you go out through the kitchen and then out the back door . Then go up the road  --  not down towardp259Newport  --  and I 'll meet you where the streetcar stops opposite 011ie 's Bakery . " These instructions were given me in a manner of being very angry at me . I began to get the idea . Whatever followed would be dangerous . " When I say goodbye to you what do I call you ? " " Alice . " " What 's your husband 's first name ? " " George , of course . " " I see . My name 's Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the exertion of her generalship and through exasperation at my stupidity . Delia rejoined us . From time to time the girls had exchanged greetings with members of the audience . Alice now raised her voice . " Hello , Barbara , hello , Phoebe . I want you to meet Dr. Cole , an old friend of George 's . " " Pleased to meet you . " " Pleased to meet you , Barbara  --  and you , Phoebe . " " Imagine , George told him , if he was in Newport to call me up . He did and Dr. Cole said he 'd meet me here . Hello , Marion , I want you to meet Dr. Cole an old friend of George 's . So Delia and I sat here trying to decide who looked like a doctor . Is n't that a sit-you-ation ! Hello , Annabel , I want you to know Dr. Cole , an old friend of George 's , just passing through town . He asked Delia and I to go to the movies with him , but of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He knew George at Norfolk before I did . George told me about this doctor he knew . Were you a doctor then , Teddie ? " " I was in my last year at Baltimore . I have cousins in Norfolk . " " Imagine that ! " said Barbara and Marion . " What a coincident ! " said Phoebe . " The world 's a very small place , " said Delia . " Well , you 'll want to talk over old times , " said Barbara . " Happy to have know 'd you , Doctor . " I had risen . The girls withdrew to talk it over.  | " That 'll go like a grass-fire , " said Delia . Alice rose . " Finish your beer , Delia . I 'm going to put my hat straight . " Now Delia and I were alone . " Alice tells me your husband will be in next week , Delia . Congratulations . " Delia looked at me hard and waggled her hands . " How long has he been gone ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be very exciting . " " You said it ! " " What ship is it ? " " Four destroyers . . . More'n two hundred men on ' em have homes right in this town . " " Have you children , Delia ? " " Three . " " Wonderful for them too . " " They 've faced it before . I 'm taking them to my mother 's . She lives in Fall River . I 'm lucky . " " I do n't understand . " " Doctor , when the men get off the ship , we 're down there waving . See ? They kiss us and all that . And then we go home to wait for them . They go straight off to the Long Wharf . " " Oh . " " You can say that again . " I was learning things . Ulysses returned to his home in disguise . None of those tear-stained embraces . They get rip-roaring drunk on the Long Wharf . No sight for children . Reunions require more courage than partings . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long separations . " Has Alice some children ? " " Alice  --  Alice and George ? " " Yes ? " ( It is characteristic of communities like a naval base that their residents believe their customs and affairs are what the earth revolvesabout ; anyone who does not know them is stupid. )  | " Married for five years and no children . It 's driving Alice wild . " " And George ? " " Says he thanks God it 's that way and gets drunk . " " When does she expect George 's return ? " " He 's here now . " I stared . " He got here a week ago . Stayed here three days . Then went up to Maine to help his father on the farm . He has three weeks ' shore leave coming to him . He 'll be back soon . " " Does everybody like George ? " Everything I said exasperated her . In certain walks of life the question of liking or not liking  --  short of downright villainy  --  does not arise . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there  --  like the weather . They 're what mathematicians call " given . " " George is all right . He drinks , but who does n't ? " She meant males . Men are expected to drink ; it 's manly . " If Alice goes to the movies with you , see that she gets back to the gate by one . " " What 'd happen if she got back after one ? " She gave me a look of exhausted patience . " Wives must often get back later when they 've been visiting their parents  --  trains late and all that ? " " They do n't kill you , if that 's what you mean . But they remember it . " That mighty word " they . " " I do n't think Alice has ever been out after eleven so they might overlook it . You ask a lot of questions . " " All I know about is the Coast Artillery . I do n't know anything about the Navy . " " Well , the Navy 's the best and do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've made you angry , Delia . I did n't mean to . " " I 'm not angry , " she said shortly . Then she looked me in theeye and said something between her lips that I could n't understand . " I did n't hear what you said . " " There 's something that Alice wants more than anything in the world . Give it to her . " " What ? ... What ? " " A baby , of course . "  |p262I  was thunderstruck . Then I was very agitated . " Did she tell you to say that to me ? " " Of course not . You do n't know Alice . " " Has Alice led other men downtown for this ? " I was so urgent that I struck her knee with my knee under the table .  --  I had pictures of troops and parades . " Take your knee away !  --  She only made up her mind that she had to last week . The evening after George went to Maine Alice and I went to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a man that sat next to her . They did n't like the movie and went out to get something to eat . She whispered to me not to wait for her . She told me later that the man had a boat tied up by the Yacht Club . She went along , but she would n't go aboard . She said that while she was walking Jesus told her the man was a bootlegger , a rum-runner , and that he 'd tie her up and start the boat and she 'd be in Cuba for weeks . She would n't walk up the gangway and when he began pulling her she screamed for the Shore Patrol . He let hold of her and she ran most of the way home . " " You swear you 're telling the truth ? " " You 're hurting my knee ! Everybody 's looking at us ! " " Swear ! " " Swear what ? " " That you 're telling the truth . " " As God is my judge ! " " And Alice would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " As God is my judge ! " I leaned back exhausted , then I leaned forward again . " Would George think it was his baby ? " " He 'd be the proudest man on the Base . " Alice rejoined us . She had touched up her appearance considerably ; there were sparks in the air . " Well , Delia , it 's late . We 'd better be going . It 's very nice to have met you , Dr. Cole . I 'll tell George . " " Goodbye , girls . I 'll write him . "  | " He 'll be sorry to have missed you . " Each of these remarks was repeated several times . I gathered that shaking hands would have been excessive . Left alone , I orderedanother beer , relit my pipe , and resumed reading . Others sat down at my table . When the moment came I obeyed Alice 's instructions , though I had to steal around to the side of the restaurantto pick up my bicycle . Alice was waiting at the streetcar stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turning her head , " I 'll sit in the front of the car . Do n't you want to bicycle down to Washington Square ? " " No . At night they let you put the bike on the back platform . " " I do n't want to go to the movies . I know a kind of quiet bar where we can talk . It 's by the telegraph office . If I see anybody I know on the car , I 'll tell them I 'm going to the telegraph office to get a money order from my mother . You follow me down Thames Street about a block behind me . " " My apartment 's not many blocks beyond the telegraph office . Could n't we go there ? " " I did n't say we were going to your apartment ! Where did you get that idea ? " " You said you liked dogs . " " The name of the bar is ' The Anchor . ' While I 'm in talking to the telegraph man you stand just inside the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there unless they 're with a gentleman-friend . " She looked at me fiercely . " This is all very dangerous , but I do n't care . " " Aw , Alice , ca n't we go straight to my apartment ? I have a little rye there . " " I told you ! I have n't made up my mind yet . " The streetcar came rattling and squealing down the road . A very dignified Alice boarded it and advanced to the front seat . At the One Mile Corner stop she was joined by some friends , a chief petty officer and his wife.  | " Alice darling , what are you doing ? " Alice launched into a long narrative filled with disasters and miracles . She held them spellbound . All passengers descended at Washington Square . She was overwhelmed with good fellowship . " I hope everything comes out all right . Good night , dear . Tell us all about it next time we see you . " Again I followed her instructions . Through the great window of the telegraph office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night clerk . Finally she started toward me with determination , her heels clicking on the brick paving . Suddenly halfway across the street she was accosted by two reeling sailors . Alice managed to do three things at once : she signaled to me to go back into " The Anchor , " she reversed her direction as though she had forgotten something in the telegraph office , and she dropped her handbag . " Alice , you cutey ! Wha ' you doin ' in the beeg city ? " " Alice , where 's George ? Where 's old Georgie , the old skunk ? " " Oh my , I 've lost my purse . Mr. Wilson , help me find my purse . I left it in the telegraph office , I know . Oh , is n't that terrible ! I 'll die ! Mr. Westerveldt , help me find my purse . " " Here it is . Lookit ! Now do I get a lil kiss  --  just a lil lil kiss ? " " Mr. Wilson ! You never said a thing like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but do n't you ever say such a thing again . I had to hurry and send a postal money order off before closing time . Mr. Westerveldt , please . . . take . . . your . . . hand .. . away . I just saw the Shore Patrol following me down Thames Street . I think you 'd better go up to Spring Street . It 's after nine . " Thames Street was out of bounds to Navy seamen after nine . They took her advice and tumbled up the hill . With set face she marched resolutely into " The Anchor , " put her arm through mine  --  single women are not allowed in the taverns on the north side of Thames Street  --  and propelled me to the last booth at the back of the room . She sat against the wallp265and shrank to the size of a child . Between her teeth she muttered , " ' That was a close call . If they 'd seen me with you , I do n't know what would have happened . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Again I was to be regarded as an idiot child . She lowered her head and said , " A Rum Floater , of course . " " Alice , please understand I 'm not a Navy man . I do n't speak Navy language . Please do n't be like Delia . I 'm not stupid ; I 'm only ignorant . I have n't been to Norfolk or to Panama . I 've been to lots more interesting places than those . " She looked surprised , but remained silent . Alice 's silences were weighty ; to borrow a schoolboy 's expression , " You could hear the wheels go round . " The Rum Floaters turned out to be rum in ginger ale , a combination I could n't abide . She fell on hers like one famished . " What was Panama like ? " " Hot ... different . " " What were you doing in Norfolk ? " " I was a waitress in restaurants . " She had turned morose . I waited for the rum to take effect . Looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have come . . . . You 've been telling lies to me all night . You do n't clean up places ' ; you live in them . You 're one of those rich people . I know what you think of me , Dr. Cole . " You made me say I was a doctor . You made me say I was an old friend of your husband 's . I 'm not rich . I coach children to play tennis . You do n't get much for that , I can tell you . Do n't let 's quarrel , Alice . I think you 're a very bright girl and very attractive too . I think you 've got knock-out eyes , for instance . You have a personality that sends out electric shocks all the time , like doorknobswhen a storm 's coming on . Alice , do n't let 's quarrel . Let 's have another Rum Floater and then I 'll take you back to the gate in a taxi . There are some taxis standing in the Square every hour of the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to my apartment . Damn it , I hope you and I are grown up enough just to bep266friends . I can see that you 've got some trouble on your mind . Well , leave that trouble behind at the Base . " She had been looking at me fixedly . " What are you looking at ? " " When I look at a man I try to figure out what movie star he looks like . I can almost always find it . You do n't look like any I 've seen . You 're not very good-looking , you know . I do n't say that to hurt your feelings ; I just say it because it 's true . " " I know I 'm not good-looking , but you ca n't say I have a lowdownmean face . " " No . " I got the barman 's attention and put up two fingers . I asked , " What movie star does your husband look like ? " She turned to me sharply . " I wo n't tell . He 's a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did n't say he was n't . " " He saved my life and I love him . I 'm a very lucky girl .  --  Oh , it would have been awful if those men had seen me with you . I 'd never have forgiven myself . I 'd have just died , that 's all . " " How do you mean  --  George saved your life ? " She gazed before her broodingly . " Norfolk is an awful town . It 's worse than Newport . I got fired out of five restaurants . It was awful hard to keep a job . There were a million girls for every job . George was beginning to kind of court me . He 'd come back to eat at the same table where I was serving . He 'd leave twenty-five cents every time ! . . . The men who ran the restaurants were always trying to take advantage of the girls ; they 'd act fresh in front of the customers . I did n't want George to see anything like that . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to marry him . And he gave me twenty-five dollars to buy some nice things , because he had a brother there in the Service too . George knew that he 'd write home about me . I owe everything to George . " Suddenly she brushed my hand with hers . " I did n't mean to hurt your feelings with what I said a while ago . You have n't got a lowdownmean face at all . Every now and then I say things  --  "  |p267Suddenly  Alice disappeared . She slid from our bench and crouched under the table . I looked about and saw that two sailors wearing the armband of the Shore Patrol had entered . They greeted a number of the guests affably and , leaning against the bar , discussed at length a certain fracas that had taken place the night before . The public joined in . The conversation threatened to be interminable . Soon I became aware that some little fingernails were scratching my ankles . I leaned over and brushed them away angrily . There are certain torments a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Finally the Shore Patrol left " The Anchor . " I whispered , " They 're gone , " and Alice hoisted herself onto the bench . " Did you know them ? " " Know them ! " " Alice , you know everybody . You 'd better make up your mind whether you 'll let me take you back to the Base , or whether you 'll come and see my apartment . " She looked at me without expression . " I do n't like big dogs . " " I was lying to you . I have n't any dog at all . But I have a pretty nice little present for you . " I had three younger sisters . Girls love presents , especially surprise presents . " What is it ? " " I wo n't tell . " " Where did you get it ? " " At Atlantic City . " " Will you give me a hint ? " " It glows at night like a big glowworm . So when you 're lonesomeat night it 'll be a comfort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture ? " " No . " " Oh !  --  It 's one of those wrist-watches . " " I could n't afford to give anyone a radium wrist-watch . . . It 's about the size of a pin-cushion . It 's friendly . " " It 's one of those things that keep papers from blowing away . " " Yes . "  | " You do n't wear a wedding ring . " " In the part of the country I come from men do n't wear themonly Catholic men wear them . I 've never been married anyway . " " If I go to your apartment you wo n't act fresh or anything ? " It was my turn to look hard and blank . " Not unless someone scratches my ankles . " " I was just tired of sitting on the floor . " " Well , you could have said your prayers . " She was staring before her in deep thought . You could " hear the wheels go round . " She leaned up against my shoulder and asked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Yes . First , I 'll pay the bill . Then you follow me . " We got there and crept up the outside staircase . I opened the door and turned on the light , saying , " Come in , Alice . " " Oh , it 's big ! " I put the paperweight on the center table and sat down . Like a cat she circled the room inspecting everything within reach . Talking to herself in short admiring phrases . Finally she took up the paperweight  --  aview of the Atlantic City boardwalk , picked out with bits of mica , under an isinglass dome . " Is this what you said I could have ? " I nodded . " It does n't .. . glow . " " It ca n't glow as long as there is one bit of sunlight or electric light around . Go into the bathroom , shut the door , turn out the light , keep your eyes closed for two minutes and then open them . " I waited . She came out , threw herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neck . " I 'll never be lonesome any more . " She put her lips against my ear and said something . I thought I heard what she said but I could n't be certain . Her lips were too close ; perhaps shyness muffled her speech . I thought I heard her say , " I want a baby . " But I had to be sure . Holding her chin with one hand I moved my ears two inches from her lips and asked " What did you I ' ' I say ? " At that moment she heard something . Just as dogs hear sounds that we can not hear , just as chickens ( I had worked on farms as ap269boy ) could see hawks approaching from a great distance , just so Alice heard something . She slid off my lap and pretended to be busy straightening her hair ; she picked up her hat and  --  resourcefulactress that she was  --  said sweetly , " Well , I 'd better be going . It 's getting late . . . . Did you really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " I sat motionless watching her play the scene . Had I said anything to offend her ? No . Made a gesture ? No . A harbor sound ? A street quarrel ? My neighbors at Mrs. Keefe 's ? In 1926 the invention known in my part of town as the " raddy-o " was present in an increasing number of homes . On a warm evening through open windows it diffused a web of music , oratory , and dramatic and comic dialogue . I had become habituated and deaf to this , and certainly Alice on the Base had become so also . " You 've been very sweet . I love your apartment . I love your kitchen . " I rose . " Well , if you must go , Alice , I 'll follow you as far as the Square and pay your taxi-man to drop you at the gate . You do n't want to meet any more of the thousand people you know . " " Do n't you move one inch . The streetcars are still running . If I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the telegraph office . " " I could walk with you perfectly safely along Spring Street . It 's darker and the Shore Patrol will have swept it up pretty well by now . Here , I 'll wrap up the paperweight . " Mrs. Keefe had furnished my room according to her own taste which called for a wide selection of table runners , lace doilies , and silk table covers to support vases and so on . I picked up one of the latter and wrapped it around the gift . I opened the door . Alice was now very subdued and preceded me down the stairs . Then I heard it  --  another music that had escaped my ears , but not hers . During the summer a small frame house near Mrs. Keefe 's had been turned into " The Mission of the Holy Spirit , " a fervent revivalist sect . A meeting was in progress . While working on farms in Kentucky and Southern California I had attended many camp/meetings of a similar kind and knew well some of their hymns , seldom heard in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lives of boys and girls growing up in rural West Virginia where the camp-meeting was the powerful center of the religious , social , and even " entertainment " life of the community . What Alice had heard was the hymn that precedes the " offering of one 's life to Jesus " : " Yield not to temptation ; Jesus is near . " We turned up the hill to Spring Street . It was deserted and I stepped forward and walked beside her . She was weeping . I enclosedher tiny hand in mine . " Life is hard , dear Alice . " " Teddie ? " " Yes . " " Do you believe in hell ? " " What do you mean by hell , Alice ? " " That we go to hell when we do bad things ? When I was a girl I did a lot of bad things . When I was in Norfolk I had to do a lot of bad things . I had a baby but I have n't got it any more . It was before I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I married George I have n't done a bad thing at all . Really , I have n't , Teddie . Like I told you , George saved my life . " " Has George ever struck you , Alice ? " She looked up at me quickly . " Do I have to tell the truth ? Well , I will . He gets very drunk after he comes back from a long tour of duty and he does strike me . But I do n't hate him for it . He has a reason . He knows that he . . . he ca n't make babies . He makes love , but no babies get to be born . Would n't that make you kind of upset ? " " Go on . " " Every now and then I thought I 'd get a baby with another man without George 's knowing about it . I do n't think going to bed with another man once in a while is very important . . . . Even though it was a lie , it would make George @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it made him feel good to be a father , that wouldn'tp271be a very bad sin , would it ? Like what they call in the Bible adult'ary . Sometimes , I think I 'd go to hell for a long time if it would make George happy . " I turned her hand over and over in mine . We reached WashingtonSquare . We crossed the street and sat down on a bench farthest from the street lights . I said , " Alice , I 'm ashamed of you . " She said quickly , " Why are you ashamed of me ? " " That you  --  who know that the heart of Jesus is as big as the whole world  --  you think that Jesus would send you to hell for a little sin that would make George happy or a little sin that you had to do to keep alive in a cruel city like Norfolk . " She put her head against my shoulder . " Do n't be ashamed of me , Teddie . . . . Talk to me . . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he never wanted to see me until I had a wedding ring on my finger . When I wrote him that I was married he changed his mind . He said he never wanted to see a hoor in his house . " I 'm not going to put down here what I said to Alice almost fifty years ago . I reminded her of some words that Jesus said and maybe I invented some . And then I said , " I 'm not going to say any more . " Her hand in mine had become calmer . I could hear " the wheels going round . " She said , " Let 's go over nearer to the street lights . I want to show you something . " We moved to another bench . She had taken something out of her handbag , but kept it hidden from me . " Teddie , I always wear a chain and locket around my neck , but when I came out tonight with Delia I took it off . You can guess who gave it to me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It had been taken several years before . A sailor about eighteen years old  --  the sailor who could have sat for any recruiting poster  --  was laughing into the camera ; his arm was about Alice . I could imagine the occasion :
