Harper &; Row . $8.95 . <P> <P> Critics like David Halberstam and former Air Force Chief of Staff Curtis LeMay have attacked him from left and right . Senators Proxmire and Fulbright have assaulted obvious flaws in the Pentagon he left behind . Adam Yarmolinsky has demonstrated the problems and agonies his former boss endured . Now come Alain Enthoven and Wayne Smith , far less ambitious and partisan , far more technically expert , too . How Much Is Enough ? examines the Robert McNamara Pentagon from the authors ' special perch in the Systems Analysis office-one of the former Defense Secretary 's showpiece creations .
