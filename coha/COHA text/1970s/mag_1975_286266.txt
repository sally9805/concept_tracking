FREEDOM AT MIDNIGHT by LARRY COLLINS and DOMINIQUE LAPIERRE 572 pages . Illustrated . Simon &; Schuster. $12.50 . <P> At the stroke of midnight on Aug. 14 , 1947 , an age ended . After an occupation of 347 years , the British gave India back to the Indians . Like every detail of that massive transition , the moment chosen for India 's deliverance was an awkward compromise . Lord Louis Mountbatten , the English viceroy , had intended to make his country 's exit on Aug. 15 , the second anniversary of Japan 's surrender in the Pacific . Legions of India 's astrologers howled ; every stellar influence on that date spelled catastrophe . The ceremony was advanced twelve hours . The stars were not fooled . <P> In this song of India , Authors Collins and Lapierre ( Is Paris Burning ? , O Jerusalem ) again display their celebrated flair for the epic . Religious confrontations , border wars , political sacrifices are illuminated like scenes in a pageant . The very sounds and odors of a vanished world are resurrected-often at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a nation is not the stuff of mere melodrama ; the historical and human scale is too profound . <P> In 1947 India was an arena of contradictions . Three hundred million Hindus and 100 million Moslems were learning that they hated the occupying British only slightly less than they hated each other . There were 3 million walking skeletons in Calcutta ; simultaneously , some of the country 's 565 maharajahs continued to test the aphrodisiacal powers of crushed diamonds . The viceroy 's house in New Delhi employed nearly 5,000 servants and 418 gardeners . But back home , England reeled under postwar debts and shortages . Coal was scarce , and a bottle of liquor cost $35 . For reasons as much financial as idealistic , the Labor government of Clement Attlee was determined to drop the white man 's burden . But there was a hitch : the bloodbath following England 's exit threatened to be worse than the one that would occur if she stayed . <P> Half-Naked Fakir . The situation was unimaginably complex-and utterly hopeless . Freedom at Midnight focuses on the four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms under which one-fifth of the world 's population will live . Perhaps because Mountbatten is one of their primary sources , Collins and Lapierre cast him in heroic mold . The great-grandson of Queen Victoria faces his task with a stiff upper lip and a trembling lower one ; he relishes the pomp of the viceroy 's office while struggling to give it away . <P> Jawaharlal Nehru , Hindu leader of India 's Congress Party and the first native Prime Minister , is also warmly praised for his Brahman sensitivity . The villain of the book is Mohammed Ali Jinnah , fanatical leader of the Moslem League , who demands the separate state of Pakistan for his people . " We shall have India divided , " he warns , " or we shall have India destroyed . "
