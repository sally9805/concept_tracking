AFTER months of dreary infighting by rule-minded officials , the 1972 Winter Olympics in Sapporo , Japan , finally and refreshingly gave way to the athletes last week . Sparked by their youthful zest , the games more than lived up to the Olympic motto : " Citius , altius , fortius " ( swifter , higher , stronger ) . Indeed , when the competition ended after ten days and 35 events , the Swiss had skied swifter , the Japanese had jumped higher , the Americans had come back stronger-and the Russians and East Germans had walked off with the lion 's share of medals . <P> The brightest of all the Olympic stars was a Dutchman : Speed Skater Ard Schenk . Like Jean-Claude Killy , the Gallic glamour boy of the 1968 games , the dashingly handsome Schenk won three gold medals and the unofficial beefcake award . Crowds of more than 40,000 packed the Mako-manai Speed-Skating Rink to see the big ( 6 ft. 3 in .. 200 Ibs. ) , blond and blue-eyed Schenk easily overpower his competition at 1.500 and 5,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dutch fans clopped their wooden shoes and shouted " Heya ! Heya ! Ard Schenk ! " he covered the 10,000-meter marathon in 15 min. , 1.35 sec. , an astonishing 22 seconds better than the old Olympic record . <P> Blinding Snowstorm . As for team efforts , the Swiss skiers upset the Austrians and all but swept the French off the slopes . The first surprise came when a 17-year-old Swiss whiz named Ma-rie-Theres Nadig nipped favored Austrian Annemarie Proell in the women 's downhill . After that , the chunky Swiss girl swiveled through a blinding snowstorm and once more bested Annemarie in the giant slalom . In the men 's division , Bernhard Russi and Roland Collombin finished one . two in the downhill . In all . the Swiss men won four of the top six positions in the downhill and second and third in the giant slalom . <P> In the 70-meter ski jump , it was evident that the Japanese have also been building . Their jumpers , painfully aware that no Japanese athlete had ever won a single event in the Winter Olympics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arcing forward like human airfoils . Yukio Kasaya . Akitsugu Konno and Seiji Aochi sailed majestically through the air to win the gold , silver and bronze medals . <P> As expected , the well-trained Russians dominated cross-country skiing and Italy 's flashy Gustavo Thoeni captured the men 's giant slalom . But totally unexpected was the performance of Wojciech Fortuna , a 19-year-old Pole who leaped out of nowhere to win the 90-meter ski jump . The young U.S. hockey team , sparked by the acrobatic saves of Goalie Mike Curran . upset the strong Czech team 5-1 and then moved into contention for a medal . In women 's figure skating , buxom Beatrix Schuba of Austria built up such a commanding lead in the school figures , the technical half of the event , that her competent but dull performance in freestyle skating did not deter her from winning the gold medal on total points . The freest spirit of all was U.S. Skater Janet Lynn . A pixy in pink , the tiny ( 5 ft. 2 in. , 108 Ibs. ) teen-ager whirled through her double @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiling elan , despite a fall , to win the freestyle and a bronze medal overall .
