Colombo ' ' Sr. on Monday was an underworld plot , ' " part of a struggle for pre-eminence among certain segments of the Italian-American community , " a police spokesman said yesterday . Those involved in the plot , which according to the spokesman , Deputy Police Commissioner Robert Daley , was " detailed , " organized and planned with care ; and " approved only days before " the shooting , will be arrested , he said , But Mr. Daley could not say when . " Rivals of Colombo " in the " Italian underworld community " hired Jerome A. Johnson to kill the reputed organizedcrime leader , Mr. Daley said , and then reportedly ordered Johnson 's execution to silence him . Mr. Daley said the police had determined that there were " two hit men , Johnson and the man who hit Johnson . " Camera as Evidence Commissioner Daley 's ' assertions followed his exhibition of a 16-mm . Bolex movie camera that he said had been rented by Johnson two days before the shooting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of evidence in the investigation and " had been traced to Boston at noon " yesterday . He declined to comment on its significance . He said further that Colombo had not been the only intended victim . " They did not intend to stop with Colombo , " Mr. Daley said , but he asserted that the police had uncovered the plot and , hopefully , had averted other assaults . " There 's only been one shooting so far and we 'd like to keep it that way , " Mr. Daley said . Colombo was shot three times in the head as he stood in Columbus Circle on Monday awaiting the beginning of the second annual Italian-American Civil Rights League 's Unity Day rally . Colombo , the founder of the league , was still in critical condition but showed signs of improvement yesterday . Seconds after Colombo was // shot , Johnson was fatally shot . The bullets found in Colombo came from a 7.65 mm. automatic pistol that the police say was taken from Johnson 's body . Johnson was killed with a bullet from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . However , the police are still not saying who killed Johnson . League officials , including Colombo 's oldest son , Anthony , 26 years old , contend that he was shot by a " nut , a fanatic . " Mr. Daley 's assertions yesterday indicated the police believed Johnson either had an accomplice or was doublecrossed by the plotters . The break in the investigation of the shootings came " within the space of a couple of hours " yesterday , Mr. Daley said , but he declined to be specific . He was asked if the resoluteness with which he spoke was based on arrests , on informants ' statements or on physical evidence , and he answered , " 1 ca n't say . " Asked if the police knew who was reportedly involved in the anti-Colombo plot , Mr. Daley said , " Yes . " He was asked their names and replied , " I ca n't say . " Questioned After Shooting On Monday after the shooting , Carlo Gambino , a reported overboss of Colombo 's , was questioned by the police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Joseph Gallo , reportedly Colombo 's rival for control of organized crime in Brooklyn , and his brother , Albert Gallo , also a reported underworld figure . Was Mr. Daley speaking of either Gambino or the Gallos , he was asked . " I ca n't say , " he said . It is known that late last week informants told police authorities in Brooklyn that Gallo was not supporting the ItalianAmerican Civil Rights League Unity Day Effort , and that there was a possibility of trouble . The police have suggested that Gambino was unhappy over the masses of publicity gained by Colombo since formation of the league one year ago . Mr. Daley , when asked if Colombo was " in disfavor in the underworld , " answered , " Obviously . " Did this struggle between the Colombo faction and his unnamed rival here have the " approval " of the ' ' underworld bosses ? " " Obviously , " Mr. Daley said . Mr. Daley said that there were to have been other victims after Colombo , " but I ca n't say who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were ? " Yes . " How many were there ? " Several . " He was asked specifically if " this was a war of the Mafia ? " and N replied : " War is too strong . But it is a struggle for power among the underworld . " Mr. Daley said last night that a report that four close associates of Colombo ? Jiggs Forlano , Carmine Persico , Hugh and Joseph Iannuciwere also marked for assassination was " absolutely pure drivel . " He also said that a report that Johnson had been promised $200,000 and a trip out of the country for shooting Colombo was " drivel . " Johnson was promised a sum of money because he was a hired gun , Mr. Daley said , but as for the amount , " I ca n't say . " He was asked if any members of the Colombo underworld " family " were suspects . He said , " I ca n't answer that . " Eyes Reported Tested Colombo , meanwhile , remained in Roosevelt Hospital , where , according to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had tested his eyes . They ' found no damage had been clone to them , the spokesman said . There had been speculation that his assailant  --  Johnsonhad been linked to Colombo , or to the league . Johnson had told a relative that he was working as a photographer for the league , but the league has denied this . Yesterday , Mr. Daley was asked if Johnson had been an employe of the league . " I do n't think you can say that , " he said . ' ' Did he have entree to the league ? " I ca n't say , " he said . Johnson 's telephone number , when called , is transferred to the league number . A relative of Johnson 's says that he called the league after the shooting on Monday and was told that Johnson was out working with the rest of the staff . Tom Nestro , public relations director for the league , said again yesterday that Johnson had not worked for his organization . At a news conference at Police Headquarters , Mr. Daley prefaced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had rented out of a paper bag , and saying : " This is Johnson 's camera . It came to light at noon today . We 've traced it to Boston . " Did it contain film ? he was asked . " I ca n't answer that , " he said . Where did the police find it ? " I ca n't say . " Where was it , and who had it ? I " I ca n't say . " Was it given to the police by someone , or did they find it ? " I Ca n't say . All I can say it was rented in Boston two days before the shooting with a rubber check . " Earlier , the police said Johnson 's possessions taken from his last address at 176 Elizabeth Street included several blank checks bearing the words Bark Book Distributors , Inc . , The company , according to the State Investigation Commission , specialized in pornography . It is partly owned by Joseph Erocchini , a reputed underworld figure . Yesterday , Robert Cahn , an attorney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Barkow , said that a quantity of checks of the company had been stolen this year , and that he had given the police the name of a woman who had reportedly offered them for sale . He said he assumed that the checks found in Johnson 's possession , were those from the stolen batch . Mr. Cahn said the police questioned the woman yesterday afternoon . Commissioner Daley said in an interview later that the police still had not found a link between Johnson and Colombo . Mr. Daley said also that there existed no evidence that Johnson had ever been used prior to last Monday as a " hit man " or hired killer . However , he added : " We know a good deal more than I 'm allowed to tell you . " Richard Garvin , the director of the Department of Community Services at Rutgers University , and Johnson 's cousin , said Johnson had given him the telephone number of the Italian-American Civil Rights League , according to Johnson , It was 242-8938.           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
