txt All that can be said after President Ford 's four days here is that in his private discussions with Chinese leaders , both sides talked very frankly and sometimes bluntly about the basic. issue of concern to them . That , quite simply , is what happened here . No policy breakthroughs . Nothing spectacular . Yet insofar as the face-to-face exchanges may help to avoid future misunderstandings , this summit was a success . As if to confirm this , Chinese senior Vice-Premier Teng Hsiaoping said on the last day of the talks that they had helped " to increase mutual understanding . " He used these words in a speech at a farewell banquet for Mr. Ford . The President , replying , reaffirmed that the United States was committed " to complete the normalization of relations with China . " Neither mentioned specifically the touchy subject of detente between the U.S. and the Soviet Union , on which Mr. Ford was , in // * Summit simply warms U.S.-China ties // effect , publicly lectured on the day of his arrival here . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States would pursue their policies guided by national interest ? in other words , the U.S. would go ahead with detente so long as it seemed in the American interest to do so . And as if to underline this , Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger ? at a news briefing ? confirmed that he would probably be going to Moscow in the near future . Shortly before leaving Washington for China , President Ford had said Dr. Kissinger would be sent to Moscow only if there were promise of progress in the U.S.-Soviet talks on strategic-arms limitation ( SALT ) . In his news briefing , Dr. Kissinger revealed that : ? China and the United States , while disagreeing on Korea , would " exercise restraint on the Korean peninsula . " ? If the U.S. eventually granted full recognition to the Peking government ( which would entail withdrawing the full recognition now given to the Chinese Nationalist Government on Taiwan ) , China would not object to continued U.S. trade , and economic and cultural contacts with Taiwan . ? China had given the United States information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vietnam war . The seven , all confirmed as killed , are presumably air-crew members missing in ornear China over the past 10 years . The remains of two have been recovered . With no communique at the end of the summit , newsmen had hoped Dr. Kissinger might have more to say in detail about the talks . That he not only confirms that no new policy was made here during the visit . What was accomplished was that rapprochement between the two countries was " once again blessed " ( as one U.S. administration source put it ) by the top leadership of China and the United States . Thus , it now seem fairly assured that the U.S.-China relationship is likely to keep moving along at somewhat the same level as it has been since former President Richard M. Nixon broke the ice between the countries . Are the United States and China a little closer as the result of this visit ? Not closer , it seems . But perhaps they are somewhat warmer toward each other , and more understanding of each other 's interests and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States who will characterize this Ford visit as pretty much a failure and say the President could have stayed at home and tended urgent matters there . On the other hand , it can be argued that Mr. Ford 's participation here in high-level talks might be good for him politically ? that there might well be a political plus in being perceived as a President who is deeply involved in dealing with foreign affairs .
