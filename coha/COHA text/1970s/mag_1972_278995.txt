Then , in January 1971 , 39 Senators climbed onto another jet and flew to Senator Richard Russell 's funeral in Georgia . The weather was foggy , and the Air Force plane carrying the Senators tried twice to land , swooping by the runway at an altitude of 90 feet . <P> Had the plane crashed on either the New York or Georgia flight , the Senate would have been practically destroyed as a political institution .
