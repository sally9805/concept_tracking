THE TALK , OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment ' AST week , a wan and scruffy dragon cane to the city looking for a disease . He had in mind ending his life , which he felt to be tedious , unsatisfactory , tax-troubled , lacking in purpose . Looking up diseases in the Yellow Pages , and finding none , he decided to enroll himself in a hospital . At St. Valentine 's , he approached a guard and asked the way to the No Hope Ward . Directed to the proper floor , he found there a bed newly made , whitewashed with sheets . He climbed in and turned on the television set , which was attached to the bed utnhilically . A nurse motored in . " What have you gut ? " asked the dragon , thinking of diseases . " Everything , " said the nurse . " Eclampsia to milk leg . There is nothing that we do not have . Our Intensive Despair Unit is the envy- of the profession . You will he edified . Every thing will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting for the sunrise . " The subsequent examinations , consultations , testifications can easily be imag ; ned . Let us hum . on . The hospital refused to give him a disease . After three day s , he 'd been offered not so much as a nip of pneumonia . " I trusted you , " he said to his nurse . His fine , fiery eves regarded her with reproach and disgust . " I thought for a while we had something worked out with the Kidney Committee , " she said . " But when they discovered the precise nature of your undertaking ... " Thinking of diseases still , the dragon left the hospital . Many fine diseases passed through his mind  --  rabies , gout , malaria , rinderpest . Or , he thought suddenly , I could get my self slain by a hero . At that moment , a Colonel of Sanitation came striding by , in his green uniform . " You there ! " he cried . " Ho , dragon , stop and patter for a bit . Quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are juicy Fruit wrappers in the streets still , after all my efforts , and the efforts of my men , day in dm out -- people , people , if we could just do something about the people , then perhaps an end to the endlessness . One could go home of a Friday night , and wipe the brow , and doff the uniform , and thank God for a day well squandered . But you -- you have a strange aspect . What kind of it thing arc vim ? Are you disposable ? Biodegradable ? Ordinary citizen out for a stroll ? Looking for work ? Member of a conspiracy ? Vegetable ? Mineral ? Two-valued ? Hostile to the national interest of the Department of Sanitation ? Thrill-crazed kid ? Objet d'art ? Circus in town ? " " I am nothing much , " said the dragon . " But I must declare , if you will allow me , that I am in a cataton ) of admiration in re your life task . Your labor is indeed Sisyphcan . " " You look rather like one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Colonel , " now that I regard you closely . Are you sure you are not a malingering Sanitation truck ? " " I do n't think so , " said the dragon . " Let it go , " the Colonel said , with a sigh . " Let it go , like so much else in this radically imperfect world , in this radically befilthed city . This is my lunch hour , after all . Would you care to rip up a chop ? I like your style , know a place  --  quiet talk , exchange of views , not-bad Gibsons , pretty waitresses , Diners Chili and American EN. - press cards accepted . " They sat over their tasty And yy onioned Gibsons . " Tell me , " said the dragon . " Are you West Point ? " " Sandhurst , " said the Colonel . " Now , what is it , exactly. , that is rating you and making you wan ? Some order of death wish , I would imagine . " " That is the case , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of existence , " said the Colonel , " or its opposite ! ' " You have put your finger on it , " said the dragon . " Dragons exist , " said the Colonel . " Only a fool would druht it . " " If pricked , do I not bleed ? " " You suffer , however , from a sort of general meaninglessness . " " Since the thirteenth century . " The Colonel thought for a moment . " You could he an endangered species , " he said . " That would give y on a meaningful life role . We love and cherish our endangered species and extend to them every courtesy . " " Nell ... " " By the authority vested in me by the Department of Sanitation , " pronounced the Colonel , " I hereby dare you an endangered species , in trnebris , inter alia , pro forma , priMUS intr-r arcs , and subject to approval at the highest levels . " " Thank you , " said the dragon . " Thank you very much . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ species , " said the Colonel . " He has a list . " " Are men on it ? " The Colonel rose up in a great fit of anger and threw his glass into the fire . Half a Gibson followed it into the flames . He then stamped from the room with skillful majesty , excellent hauteur , and the bill . The dragon , filled with self-regard and convinced that he had at last gotten a message to the Authorities , Nought a two-dollar lottery ticket and decided to stop smoking . Embattled NEW YORK Crre has to lose two members of Congress this year , having lost some of its population in the last census . Governor Rockefeller and the leaders of the two parties in the Legislature are the men responsible for determining the shapes and sizes of congressional districts in the state , and they have been trying to decide which congressmen to eliminate . It has been known for sonic time that Manhattan will lose one representative , and last week Congresswoman Bella Abzug convened a press conference to announce that she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been scheduled for partition and redistribution , and that this was a decision she was not about to accept . The press conference was at the Congresswoman 's New York office , on the second floor of the Veterans Administration Building , on Seventh Avenue in the Twenties . Ms. Abzug shares the second floor with her colleague Congressman Charles B. Rangel , with something called Curative Industries , and with local offices of the Food and Nutrition Service of the Department of Agriculture and of the United States Information Agency . The press-conference room was small and was filled with well over a hundred people  --  reporters , and friends of the Congresswoman 's . There were chairs for the reporters but none for the friends . Since the former were mostly men and the latter mostly women , this meant that the men sat down and the women stood up . We sat down next to Sam Roberts , who is a young reporter for the News . Sam said , " God , what a mob ! " Then it appeared that the press conference would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off in a corner with Douglas Ireland , the young man who managed Ms. Abzug 's congressional campaign , and let him brief us on what might happen to the Nineteenth C.D. " This is the most deliberate dismembering of a congressional district I 've ever seen , " said Mr. Ireland , who is big and both mild and sharp . " The West Side above Fortieth Street goes to William Ryan . Part of the lower East Side goes to Edward Koch . The rest of the district  --  Greenwich Village , Chelsea , Little Italy , and Chinatown  --  goes to , of all people , John Murphy , of Staten Island , this remote reactionary from the subu rhs . " The mood in the press-conference room during the waiting was one of cheerful bustle , and the talk was mostly domestic or political : " My guess is she wants to leave herself flexible . " " No wonder you could n't get hold of them last night . Everyone was at the McGovern dinner . " " You hying the steak . bring something to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was operated on last May . " Several choruses of " Bella is our leader . She will not he moved " were sung , but the song broke up in laughter when someone tried to sing , " Bella speaks against high prices . She will not he moved . " Ms. Abzug appeared during the singing . She was wearing a smartly cut purple suit patterned with small blut , diamonds , and a nice big purple felt hat . She was accompanied by Manhattan Borough President Percy Sutton , and she let the singing go on while a camera crew from one of the TV stations got settled . She looked as though the singing made her feel gratified and faintly embarrassed and slightly mystified . Then she said , " People . My sisters and my brothers . I regret I bad to call this press conference . I regard politics as something that belongs to the people , but apparently some people do n't . I have received extremely disturbing reports of the pending dismemberment of the Nineteenth C.D. This outrageous discrimination is ap parently being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genuine representation of the needs of ordinary citizens , of women , of poor and middle-income communities . I did not win election by making deals with politicians , and I do n't intend to lose my sent in Congress by becoming the sacrificial victim of male deals . " The Congresswoman 's voice was slightly hoarse , but her delivery was forceful . She explained that she thought eliminating her district would he an insult both to the people in her district , who would lose her services , and to the women of the whole country , who had only ten other representatives in the House . She said that the Governor and the Legislature were in for serious trouble if they went ahead with their reported plans . " I stand here as a symbol , though I 'm very real in the body , " she said . " I can expect to have the overwhelming support of the women in the country . " This got cheers and a few stamps from her friends . Then she said , " This may even be a historic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought in before hack-room deals cut them nut . " Later , there was a question period . Borough President Sutton was asked if he thought the press conference would have any effect . " Oh , yes , indeed , " he said . " We find a great deal of flexibility in government when the proper pressure is mounted . " Outside the room , afterward , feeling was running high . We stopped to chat with two elected district leaders from Ms. Abzug 's district  --  Jane Buchenholz and Alex Rosenberg . " I 'll die before I let anyone get her out of Congress , " said Ms. Buchenhula . " We are completely prepared to do anything , " said Mr. Rosenberg . The reporters were n't so sure . " She gave ' em hell , all right , " said one . " Was n't much else she could do . Is n't much else Rocky can do , either , when you think about it . Somebody has to go , and there 's only Ryan , Koch , Rangel , and Abzug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ryan 's been around for years  --  the first reform congressman . Koch has a fine record . Bella 's been a good congresswoman , hut ? well , I guess I better lower my voice . " 14'arden JOHN SPARROW , the Warden of All Souls College , Oxford , who is an animated man of sixty-five with a tie- " Come , come now ! Prime time , everybody ! " termined chin and an alert , friendly air , came here recently to deliver the opening address at an anniversary exhibition on John Donne ( 1572-1631 ) at the Grolier Club , and we had a talk with him the day before at a Gramercy Park home of culture and refinement where he was a guest . " What shall I say at the Grolier tomorrow : " he said . " I have n't prepared a speech . Perhaps I 'll just declare the exhibition open and sit down . " We asked him about his interest in Donne . " When I was fifteen , I already had a passion for collecting hooks , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the town in the Midlands near which I was brought up , I found a little book with no title page but with a preface signed ' John Donne . ' I think I paid three shillings for it . I wrote an essay about it for school and won a prize . The prize was a bibliography of John Donne by Geoffrey  --  later Sir Geoffrey  --  Keynes . He 's now eighty-four . wrote him asking about nq book . It was Donne 's ' Devotions . ' I began to collect Donne . I 've always been very fond of Latin , and I 'm now collecting Renaissance Latin books , mostly published in Italy . I 'm collaborating with a professor in Florence on an anthology of Renaissance Latin verse . One begins by collecting , and then one develops an intellectual interest in the things one collects . I have a whole wall of Renaissance-and-onward Latin books in my library at Oxford . The college gives the Warden a beautiful house , with room for pictures and books . The Oxford University Press , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refused to print our anthology  --  the editors thought it would n't sell well enough --  -- so the Messrs . Duckworth are going to do it . Well , it wo n't set the Thames on fire . " We asked about Al Souls . " It was founded in the fourteen-thirties , " the Wa rden said . " It is unique in that it has no students , only fellows  --  about sixty in all . Two junior fellows  --  from among the fields of law , history , philosophy , economies , and politics  --  are elected by examination ever year for seven-year periods , which can 28 FEDRUARY 2 6. 1 9 7 2 he renewed . We also elect research fdlows , who may he scientists ; we recently got a cosmologist from Cambridge . Then , we have visiting fellows , a new feature  --  professors , mostly English , American , and Australian , but we have had one- from Russia and two from Japan  --  who come either for a semester or for a year . They live with us . Some are on sabbatical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make it up . George Kerman is coming for the second time ; Lionel Trilling I hop- is coining . We instituted these visiting fellowships a few years ago as a means of dealing with the embarrassing surplus revenue we have become possessed of . It arose from properties we 'd inherited from the Co-Founder , Archbishop Chichele  --  a lot of agricultural estates and some valuable properties near London . It was one of the things inquired into by a University Commission in 1966 . These visiting fellowships were a very happy solution to our problem . " Mr. Sparrow , a bachelor , became a fellow in 1929 , soon after graduating from New College , and was twice reelected . In 1931 , he was called to the bar , and practiced in the Chancel ) Di- ? ? ision ? " trusts , wills , company law , no criminal or jury work " ? until war broke out , in 1939 . " I joined the Army as a private , " he said . " I 've never enjoyed anything more . It was delightful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Coldstream Guards . Well , I liked that , too . Then I was seconded to the War Office . The Adjutant-General , Sir Ronald Adam , was a grizzled aristocrat , but he was a complete radical . He did n't believe in the regimental system . He made me a major , in charge of his Morale Committee . Every divisional commander had to put in a report on the troops ' morale for the quarter . We made great use of the censors ' reports on the men 's mail  --  we found that morale depended largely on their relations with their wives . Running away from the enemy was not a problem . In fact , the nearer the men were to the enemy , the better their morale was . " Having returned to the bar in 1946 , Mr. Sparrow left it in 1952 to become Warden . " It was an agonizing decision , " he said . " I loved the bar . I had just applied for silk applied to become a King 's , or Queen 's , Counsel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joyed the bar because you are paid to argue there and I love to argue . You dress up and argue for money . " We asked Mr. S. , who has been here many times , for his current impressions . " My , impression is that in New York anything might happen at any moment , " he said . " In England , nothing could happen , ever . " He paused , and added , " Well , something almost happened at All Souls a few years ago . There was a student uprising at Oxford , and we had to put up the portcullis . ' Open All Souls ! ' a cry went up . A. L. Rowse , the Cornish historian , one of our resident fellows , went out and confronted the militant students . ' What work have you done ? ' he asked them . Silence . ' I 've written thirty books , ' he said . ' You 're just the bourgeoisie . ' Nothing happened . " Mr. Sparrow has produced a number of hooks , too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Warren Report , " but we will quote from only one , " Line Upon Line : An Epigraphical An-which reflects his interest in At the Mercer Arts Center WE were at the Mercer Arts Cen- ter the other night . The Mercer Arts Center is a little hit of theatrical chic that has been carved out of the rump end of what used to he the Broadway Central Hotel ( it is now , more respectably , the Hotel University ) , on Mercer Street , near West Third , and it involves several theatres and a workshop , a bar , a boutique , an acting school , and a cabaret theatre , all put together in a manner ( roughly the mariner of the Public Theatre , a few blocks north ) designed to convince one that at least a hundred exciting things are going on at the same time all around . We did not see either of the two available plays at the Mcrccr Arts Center that evening . At first , we were in a bar called Ohie Alley , a crowded sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glass , plastic , and whatever other transparent materials there arc , and then we were in the cabaret theatre , where , we had been told , two young men of our acquaintance , the lyricist and singer Arthur Morey and the pianist and singer Bobby Paul , were performing . Once inside the cabaret theatre , we went to sit with three friends . Morey and Paul were singing a song called " Fat World , " which dealt with " the delicious ambiguities of fat . " The mode of presentation was familiar , and the music resembled other cabaret music , but we had not heard a song on this subject before and so we listened intently . We also looked intently at what we sincerely believe to be the most plastic room in New York . The cabaret theatre had two elevated seating areas ( elevated almost to the height of the stage ) , which were separated by a little canyon of an aisle . On the elevated seating areas were plastic chairs and plastic tables and the obligatory plastic ashtrays , and gigantic mirrors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other so that everyone in the seating area was faced with many images of himself disappearing into infinit ) . Guarding the elevated seating areas were little transparent-plastic posts supporting a little transparent-plastic chain . Everything was either red or white or blue . " I like it , " said a girl named Mary Mitchell , who is a friend of Arthur Morey 's . " I 'm really getting into plastic . Not just physical plastic , though . My friend Peter and I gave a part ) the other night , and we had a Holiday Magic man demonstrate Holiday Magic cosmetics . I really love cosmetics now I bought Banana Body Lotion and Papaya Dew Moisture Creme and , of course , the Strawberry Frappe Cleanser . You can make a lot of money selling cosmetics , you know . The Holiday Magic man said there was a neurosurgeon from South Africa who gavLup South Africa and neurosurgery because he made so much money selling Holiday Magic cosmetics . " Arthur Morey and Bobby Paul sang a song about the hidden dangers of California , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marathon for peace and beauty . Then Arthur Morey came to sit down . Arthur Morey is about thirty . He was dressed in blue pants with white pocket flaps , a belted vest of brown leather without the belt , and hoots . " This is what I want to do , " he said . " Write songs and sing them . I have been doing other things for a long time . I.Vlien / left Harvard , I went to Chicago . I spent years in Chicago . I was in an interdisciplinary program set up by the Committee on Social Thought at the University of Chicago . I was studying with fancy people like Hannah Arendt and Saul Bellow . " We asked Mr. Morey if he had got a degree of some sort . " No , " he said . " It takes three or four years to get a degree . Finally , I came to Nrw York to be a star .
