txt Israel is hardening its stand against the Palestinians in the wake of the Rabat Arab summit conference 's decision to recognize the Palestine Liberation Organization ( PLO ) as their sole legitimate representative . ? For the first time in nearly a year , the Israeli authorities have arrested and deported to a neighboring Arab country four Palestinians from the West Bank of . the Jordan likely to cause trouble for the Israeli occupation authorities . ? Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin , whose inclinations in the premiership have been more flexible toward the Palestinians than those of his predecessor , Mrs. Golda Meir , has come out unequivocally against any dialogue with the PLO . Mr. Rabin told a group of visiting British Zionists Sunday : " The PLO strives according to its own statements for the destruction of the State of Israel . We reject the decisions of the Rabat conference because they make the PLO the only party for negotiations with Israel . . . . The Israeli Army is now strong enough to enable use to determine our own future . " Hard-line tone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rabat he did not use such hard-line language . It reflects : ( 1 ) his disappointment with the increasingly uncompromising stand of the Arab countries which have gone far from the idea of a " just and lasting peace " which had inspired Israel 's disengagement agreements with Egypt and Syria in the first half of this year ; and ( 2 ) Israel 's evidently regained confidence in its military strength . As for the deportations , the four men were said by an Army spokesman to be members of the clandestine Palestine Liberation Front , which is believed to have Communist connections . They were accused in an official statement of being members of a " terrorist organization which perpetrated deeds of terrorism and murder . " One of the four was All Mahmoud al-Khatib , editor of the Arabic-language newspaper Al-Shaab , published in East Jerusalem . This paper had gond so far as to demand the expulsion from Israel of all Israelis who had come into the country since 1947 . This was perhaps further than other Arabic-language publications on the West Bank have gone so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legitimacy on the PLO had markedly encouraged Palestinians in Israeli-occupied territory to speak up and out ? usually against Israel and the PLO . Many Israelis were surprised that the Israeli censors did not prevent the publication of some articles which ( as they saw it ) sounded downright seditious . But if the censors did not act to prevent publication , the security authorities have followed up with the first deportations in nearly a year . // *Israel toughens stand // John Cooley cables from Beirut : James Abourezk , the Lebanese-born Democratic Senator from South Dakota , is quoted in Beirut 's independent newspaper Al-Nahar Monday as saying Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger and President Ford will find it difficult , if not impossible , to steer U.S. policy in the Middle East away from one-sided support of Israel because of Zionist influence in the U.S. Congress . The newly elected Congress , Senator Abourezk continued in remarks quoted by Al-Nahar publisher Ghassan Tweini , now on a lecture tour in the U.S. , will press for a much larger role than under President Nixon in guiding U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Secretary Kissinger 's freedom of action as severely limited by the recent mandate given the PLO by the Arab states , by Israel 's refusal to negotiate with the Palestinians , and by the rise of anti-American resentment against the Arabs , who ( he says ) are blamed for inflation and economic recession in the U.S. Americans , says Mr. Tweini , wonder whether they can sustain another Arab oil embargo , which appears virtually certain in case of a new Mideast war . They are also asking whether Secretary Kissinger could deal with an Israeli nuclear initiative in such a war . From his present vantage point in the U.S. , Mr Tweini ? whose opinions have great influence in Arab capitals ? says he expects Dr. Kissinger to be unsuccessful in his efforts to press Israel to deal with the Palestinians . Israel , says Mr. Tweini , might then launch war against Syria . If successful , he says , this would invite Soviet interference , U.S. counteraction , and finally a new peace imposed by Moscow and Washington .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
