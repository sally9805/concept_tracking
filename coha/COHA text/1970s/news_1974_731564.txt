txt The Federal Reserve Bank of New York , in a move to help solve the problems of the ailing Franklin National Bank , assumed responsibility yesterday for the bank 's contracts to buy and sell foreign currencies . The Federal Reserve bank took over orders to buy or sell approximately $800-million of foreign exchange between now and the middle of 1975 . Because of its difficulties , the Franklin had trouble operating in the foreign exchange field . The unusual take-over of Franklin 's foreign-exchange contracts  --  thought by some Federal Reserve officials to be tehe first such action ever taken ? helped move the bank toward an ultimate resolution of its difficulties . A Federal Reserve officer would not say , however , whether it enhanced the bank 's chances of remaining independent . Last May , Franklin decided to omit payment of dividends , and it disclosed large foreignexchange trading losses . Since then , it reported total earnings loss of $83-million for the first six months of the year , and some 53 per cent of the bank 's deposits have since been withdrawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chairman of the Franklin , stated that the shift of foreign exchange contracts to the Federal Reserve was " consistent with our objective of restructuring this bank as a regional operation on Long Island . " On Long Island , meanwhile , the bank drew growing support from members of Congress and the Association of Commerce and Industry to remain an independent but scaled-down institution . Representative Angelo Roncello , a Republican from Long Island and a member of the House ' Banking and Currency Committee , stated that he was " deeply disturbed over threatened action to put the Franklin National Bank in receivership for liquidation by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation . " Mr. Roncallo , in a letter to Representative Wright Patman , the Texas Democrat who is chairman of the House Banking Committee , also urged that the Franklin be " treated fairly . " The action contemplated against the bank , he said , " could cause shockwaves through the entire banking system . " Frank Wille , chairman of the F.D.I.C. , was reported to be in New York yesterday , but he could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Franklin 's current problems first came to public notice , the bank announced that it would not pay second - quarter dividends , and it disclosed large losses in its foreign exchange trading . Since then , the bank has reported a loss for the first six months of tihro year of about $8.3-million , and trading in its securities has been suspended . Deposits , which totaled $2.99-billion in early May , swiftly drain out of the bank . In the week ended Wednesday , ' deposits averaged $1.41-billion , reflecting a loss of 53 per cent of the balances kept in the bank . Domestic deposits recently , however , have increased slightly in two of the last three weeks . Over the summer , the Franklin has been bolstered by a loan of $1.4-billion from the Federal Reserve , and the central bank reportedly has been pressing to get its money back and resolve the bank 's status . Earlier this month , Mr. Barr submitted to the F.I.D.C. a plan to cut back the bank to a Long Island regional institution . To accomplish this , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of loans , guarantees and the purhase of some assets to get money to reduce its borrowing from the Federal Reserve . The alternative route to a resolution of the bank 's problems would be to declare it insolvent and to sell its assets to other banks at competitive bidding  --  a process that would leave Franklin 's 20,000 shareholders with nothing . The Chemical Bank , the First National City Bank , the Manufactuerers Hanover Trust Company and the European-American Bank and Trust Company reportedly are readying bids for Franklin assets if this second path is followed . Because of its problems , other c ( banks and foreign-exchange dealers have been reluctant to take Franklin 's name on a contract that matures some ' ( months away , a Federal Reserve spokesman said . To eliminate this problem and also to assist the functioning of the foreign exchange markets generally , the New York Federal Reserve Bank took over Franklin 's contracts Under the agreement , the New York Federal Reserve stands ready to meet Franklin 's foreign exchange commitments on schedule , Under the arrangement , the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which will be assumed by the Franklin . The total includes some unauthorized contracts that were described by the bank in May as having been made without its knowledge . A bank spokesman said he could n't say exactly what part of the total taken over by the Federal Reserve were such unauthorized contracts , but he noted that the bank had already taken $45-million in losses in foreign ex change . In an article in Fortune F scheduled for publication next week , the magazine reports that the Franklin not only had F $45.8-million of foreign exchange losses in the first half F of 1974 but also that $4-million F in foreign exchange profits realized in September , 1973 , and March , 1974 , " were the result of self-dealing transactions . " Dealing with a Swiss bank named Amincor , Franklin made a $2-million bogus foreign exchange profit in September , 1973 , that enabled the bank to pay its third quarter dividend , Fortune reported . The dividend payment also enable Franklin to continue merger talks with Talcott National , a factoring and finance company . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merge with Talcott on he ground that it would dilute the bank 's effort to improve its management . The action came shortly before Franklin 's announcement of its dividend omission in May . Again in March , 1974 , Franklin netted a false $2-million profit from another foreignexchange transaction with Amincor , Fortune reported in its chronicle of the bank 's woes .
