txt A NEW DRIVE to eliminate Jail penalties for marijuana smokers is gaining momentum , according to its backers , with more states expected to decriminalize the drug soon . Since President Carter joined the call for " decriminalization , " champions of the cause have begun talking of " when , " not " If . " So far , eight states have adopted a noncriminal approach to marijuana legislation . Supporters of marijuana reform have selected to states , including Illinois , where they plan to push for decriminalization . THE ROLL YOUR OWN crowd takes the position that marijuana should be treated today the same way that alcohol was treated during Prohibition , It evidently makes a persuasive analogy . " During Prohibition it was illegal to sell or transport alcohol , but they did n't make possession illegal  --  no one went into private homes busting people tor booze . " says Paul H. Kuhn , Midwest coordinator for the National Organization to Reform Marijuana Laws iNORMLI . " What we 're trying to do right now with marijuana is get back to Prohibition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't work with marijuana either , but it is a step in the right direction . " WHEN DR . ROBERT L. DuPont , dlrector of the National Institute on Drug Abuse , said recently that growing pot at home should n't be a crime , the reaction at NORML was almost giddy . DuPont , who is serving under his third president , " has been getting more and more honest , " says Kuhn . Two years ago , DuPont said tobacco and alcohol were bigger threats to public health in America than marijuana . In Washington , Keith Stroup , NORML 's national director , says that although Illinois is a ' ' target state " for marijuana-reform advocates , he believes it may be a year or two before a new law is passed because Gov . Thompson has opposed " decriminalization . " " It 's difficult to get a law passed with the threat of a veto , " says Stroup . " But we think that Thompson must not have really studied this question or he would n't take that position . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'll // Status of marijuana legislation ? ? . WASH MASS . R.I.

Tribune flino Illinois one of 10 targets for legal pot // catch up on this issue . " THE NEXT state to drop jail penalties from its marijuana laws may he Mississippi . A reform measure has been approved by committees in both houses of that state 's legislature . " The reason we 're doing well in Mississippi is that reform is supported by the state narcotics bureau there , " says Stroup . Traditionally , the main support for harsh marijuana laws has been found among those who enforce the laws . ? Others  --  including lawyers . doctors . teachers , and drug counselors  --  have long supported reducing or eliminating penalties for possession of small amounts of marijuana . MANY LAW enforcement people now are coming around to this view . Pat Horton , the local prosecutor in Eugene , Ore. , sells some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for pot possession about four years ago . Since then , Horton says , " our criminal court dockets are no longer consumed with marijuana cases  --  they once were about : t0 per cent of our cases , and they almost always ended in suspended sentences of probation . " Oregon police now arc concentrating narcotics enforcement efforts on those selling " hard " drugs and a large percentage of those arrested are sentenced to prison , he says . In the Chicago area , two suburban communities ? Palatine and Deerfield  --  have used home rule powers to drop criminal penalties for possession of marijuana . PALATINE POLICE Lt. Harold Nein ' , low says that before the law was changed last fall , police were reluctant to arrest youngsters who had a few marijuana cigarets because they knew the courts were unlikely to do anything . Now , Nehnizew says , officers can write a ticket on an offending youth and be confident that a $50 fine will be levied . " Before the teen-agers around here did what they wanted because they knew nothing would happen to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're not so sure . " Deerfield Police Chief Richard Brandt says his office also likes having a local law that fines marijuana users instead of jailing them because they , too , found the courts reluctant to act under the harsher law . ALTHOUGH ADVOCATES of marijuana law reform often use pot themselves , they do n't necessarily favor full legalization of marijuana that would lead to a fullblown commercial market in the drug . Kuhn for example , says that he would hate to see marijuana commercialized and marketed as tobacco is now . " When marijuana was banned 40 years ago , there was no national debate , " Kuhn says . " The only people who used pot then were blacks and Mexicans . Since marijuana was outlawed , we 've had years and years of lies about it spread by the narcs narcotics enforcement officers . " We hope that our drive to change marijuana laws now will lead to a national debate , a reappraisal of how we treat tobacco and alcohol as well as marijuana . " I DoN " r THINK that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and f do n't think we should allow advertising for tobacco or alcohol , either . " If national police permitted use of marijuana , tobacco , and alcohol , but discouraged use of all such drugs as being harmful to health , Kuhn says it would be more logical than the current.situation . The present drive to drop criminal penalties fur marijuana possession is described by Kuhn as " just a cease-fire . Let 's decide what to do about marijuana . let 's talk about it . But in the meantime , let 's stop arresting us. "
