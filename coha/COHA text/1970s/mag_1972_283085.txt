Chairman Mao has said that " education must serve proletarian politics and be combined with productive labor . " The extent to which this is now being practiced in China would startle most Westerners . TIME 's Jerrold Schecter , who was allowed to stay on in China after the departure of President Nixon , paid a visit to Futan University in Shanghai and cabled this report : <P> The ferocity of the Cultural Revolution has disappeared from the tree-lined walkway leading to the red brick dormitories . Wall posters now extol the virtues of serving the people and studying the thoughts of Chairman Mao . " Heighten our vigilance and defend our motherland , " says one . Only tattered remains of the big posters from the revolution hint at the turmoil that closed Futan University for nearly three years . Reopened in November 1970 , it has been transformed . <P> Novelties . Imagine a university director who is a political organizer from a textile mill ; students who are mostly army privates or the children of factory workers ; an American-trained academic with a world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the yield of wheat ; physicists making transistors for portable radios . <P> All these things are actually happening at Futan , Shanghai 's biggest and most prestigious center of higher education , and now a monument to Maoism . Formerly the French missionary Aurora College , Futan , with its student body reduced from 6,500 to 1,135 , is still in the throes of change . <P> A 30-ft. pink statue of Chairman Mao stands at the university 's entrance . Inside the building , the curriculum is being radically reshaped to reflect Mao 's doctrine that colleges should combine " education , production and scientific research . " In practice , this means that Futan has completely dropped the traditional courses in literature and science and replaced them with such subjects as electronics and optics-and it conducts those classes in its own factories . Built and operated by the university , the factories produce equipment ranging from quartz-tungsten lamps to logic circuits for third-generation computers . The university also plans a petrochemical plant . " The purpose of these factories is to serve as a base for scientific experiments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technician whose ardent agitprop work won him the leadership of the university . " It is to change the situation that prevailed before the Cultural Revolution , when practical knowledge was divorced from theoretical knowledge . " <P> Combining theory and practice proved easier in the six science departments than in the seven arts departments , according to Tang . In the department of Chinese literature , he says , students charged that the professors had created " a hotbed for the restoration of capitalism . " Throughout the autumn of 1969 , while the university remained closed , " struggle , criticism and transformation " sessions were held because the professors " did not see society as a factory and kept divorcing the students from the masses . " As one pigtailed coed put it : " We were wearing new shoes , but still going on the old road . "
