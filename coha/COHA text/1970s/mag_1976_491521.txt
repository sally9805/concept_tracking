ANTARCTICA : THE MOST UNEARTHLY PLACE ON EARTH By Nat B. Read , Jr . For most of the year 1975 , eighty-five American men were trapped by severe weather in four separate bases in the total darkness of the Antarctic continent . Their last physical contact with the outside world was in February , and it was September when physical contact was reestablished and October before aircraft began regular flights with supplies and assistance . In the meantime , the isolated Americans kept warm and healthy , their food supplies held out , they stayed in contact with the outside world by shortwave radio , and plenty of valuable research was completed . Do n't waste any sympathy on the trapped parties ; they volunteered for this entrapment and things are working out just as they planned . This was the twentieth straight year that Americans have been sealed off from the rest of mankind during the severe Antarctic winter . . . the twentieth year since the Navy 's Operation Deep Freeze opened the way for year-round scientific research on the seventh continent . Although it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world , the Antarctic continent at the bottom of the world still is n't a part of the world the public knows and understands . We can understand it better if we think of it as another planet altogether , a piece of outer space somewhere between here and the moon . The nations of the world deal with it in international law as they do with the moon . NASA used it as a laboratory because of its similarity to the moon and other planets . It ca n't be reached from the rest of the world for six or more months of the year , and even then , only by expeditionary efforts . It has no native human beings , and even today no one lives there ; it is inhabited by visitors  --  explorers who stay for a few days , weeks , or months , or at the very most , a year or two . In the entire history of the planet , no human being has ever been born there . The Antarctic , after twenty-one years of the Navy 's Operation Deep Freeze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " out of this world . " Our human experience gives us no tools with which to understand the seventh continent . To those of us who shiver in winters of 26 degrees below zero ( F ) , the thought of 126 degrees below zero is unimaginable . To people who dread the 60-mile-per-hour force of a hurricane in semitropical temperatures , the concept of 200-mile-per-hour winds in the hitter , brutal cold is beyond our most vivid imagination . And the amount of ice and snow in one place can not be programmed into our finite data banks . Think of it this way : If all of the ice and snow in the entire Arctic region at the top of the world were combined with the ice and snow of all of Alaska , Canada , Siberia and all the ski resorts of the world , it would total only about 5 percent of the snow and ice on earth . The other 95 percent is in Antarctica . The ice is piled up nine times as high as the Sears Tower  --  the highest building on earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would raise the level of the oceans of the world by 200 to 250 feet . Her Majesty , the Statue of Liberty , would be up to her lofty nose in salt water , and to visit her , you 'd have to catch a boat from the middle of Pennsylvania . Thirty of the world 's fifty largest cities would be under water . The Antarctic , at the bottom of the world , is much different from the Arctic region at the top of the world . The Arctic area around the North Pole is water  --  a frozen ocean surrounded by land . American nuclear submarines have actually sailed across the top of the world beneath the ice . The Antarctic , however , is a continent of land , completely surrounded by water . Over the centuries , ice has piled up to form a huge ice cap covering 95 percent of the continent . Yet with all of that frozen water in the form of snow and ice , the Antarctic is actually a desert , a dry continent with almost no moisture at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ windiest , coldest , driest and most desolate of the seven continents . The human race has lived on the other six continents for eons . It has kept its foothold on the seventh continent for only twenty years , a time span well within the memory of most living Americans . In 1955 , American scientists and Navymen of " Operation Deep Freeze " prepared for the upcoming International Geophysical Year ( IGY ) by building a few quarters in which man could survive year-round on that forsaken bottom edge of the map . The American flag , which had gone there and returned a number of times before , was raised to stay , and twenty years later , our flag is still there . In so many ways , the two decades of human habitation have scarcely affected this desolate land . Only thirty-five " communities " dot the entire continent . Man has still set foot on only a small fraction of the continent and is still able to live there only in survival conditions . And with all of our technology , we can fly aircraft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ During the other half the continent is almost as remote from the rest of the earth as outer space . No one can go there , no one can get back , and those who are there can not travel about . Only four small parties have ever reached the South Pole by land , and only one party has ever crossed the continent on the surface . But Antarctic life has changed in those twenty years at the bottom of the world . The crude encampments of the beachhead groups have given way to a few modern buildings , including a five-story-high aluminum dome at the South Pole . Women have broken the ice barrier , and are counted with the men as Antarctic veterans . And the inevitable has happened : tourists venture timidly to the fringes of the continent during its warmest months , adding color slides of the seventh continent to their snapshots of the other six . The first women to winter over in the Antarctic were Mrs. Jackie Ronne and Mrs. Jennie Darlington , who spent the winter of 1947-48 there with their husbands on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Expedition from the United States . Women reached the South Pole fifty-eight years after men did , when six female scientists stepped off a Navy Hercules LC-130 transport in 1969 . Rear Admiral D.F . Welch , Operation Deep Freeze commander at the time , arranged for the side-by-side walk-down to avoid the question of which woman reached the South Pole first . Then in 1974 , Dr. Mary Alice McWhinnie , a biologist from DePaul University , made history by wintering over at McMurdo Station as the station 's scientific leader . Dr. McWhinnie , along with fellow DePaul biologist Sister Mary Odile Cahoon , were the first American women to winter over in the Antarctic since 1947-48 , and only the third and fourth in history . Last summer , the female contingent increased . The summer party ( using the scientific sense of that word , of course ) of 1975 included three women Naval officers , six women researchers , two female secretaries and two women mess cooks . Tourists first reached the Antarctic eighteen years ago , following the whalers , explorers , and scientists to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Antarctic has held such captivation for the tourists that some have returned as many as six times , according to Lindblad Travel , Inc. , which takes tour groups there on its own specially built , 2,300-ton vessel , the M.S. Lindblad Explorer . The scientists I talked to in the Antarctic had grave reservations about tourists coming to Antarctica , but they need n't worry . It runs a couple about $10,000 to make the tourist trek , and at those prices in an **25;3758;TOOLONG economy , how massive can the tourist influx really be ? Why did we go there in the mid-Fifties and why are we staying in that unworldly land so far from home in the mid-Seventies ? Mainly because it 's there . If there 's anything of value to be mined or shared , the U.S. wants to be part of the mining or sharing . Operation Deep Freeze commander , Rear Admiral George J. Dufek , pretty well summed it up in a U.S. News &; World Report interview in 1955 : Q. Why does anyone want to go there ? A. It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valuable ? A. That we do n't know , but the possibilities are there . Officially we are in the Antarctic with tax-supported projects and personnel for three reasons : ( 1 ) to help keep the peace outlined in the Antarctic Treaty , ( 2 ) for research and exploration , and ( 3 ) to help protect the ecology of this unspoiled continent . That probably translates to " international prestige " and in that regard can be lumped together with the American space program , which the Antarctic effort so closely resembles . The entire American presence in the Antarctic is overseen by the National Science Foundation ( NSF ) , through its United States Antarctic Research Program ( USARP ) . The National Science Foundation uses its worthwhile portion of the federal budget to foot the bill for all scientific research there plus the logistical support necessary to back up the scientific efforts . It subcontracts with the U.S. Navy for aircraft , ships and other support contingents and with civilian contractors for construction and maintenance help . The primary civilian contractor is Holmes &; Narver , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Seventy different scientific projects are covered by the 116 National Science Foundation grants for the 1974-75 American Antarctic program . These seventy projects are spearheaded by leading scientists in universities and government agencies throughout the country . Institutions or agencies in twenty-one states are sponsoring Antarctic projects this year , with California heading the list with fifteen separate projects sponsored by its institutions . Altogether , 290 American scientists and technicians went to the Antarctic in the 1974-75 year . They represented forty universities , governmental agencies and industrial firms . Among the 290 Americans , six were women . In keeping with the international spirit of cooperation in the Antarctic , thirteen of the U.S. projects involved research by scientists of other Antarctic Treaty nations working alongside American counterparts . Yankee scientists this year will shiver alongside researchers from Argentina , Australia , Chile , Denmark , France , Great Britain , Japan , New Zealand , Norway and the USSR . Most of the seventy American projects were completed during the austral summer , when the temperatures became bearable and when the sun shone twenty-four hours a day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year 's stay on the continent for a handful of American scientists , who are " wintering-over " on the Antarctic at this time . The research conducted in the American Antarctic program falls into three broad categories : Antarctic land , animals and atmosphere . There are very few animals to study on the land itself . Of the fourteen species of penguins in the Southern Hemisphere , only two are found on the continent itself : the tuxedoed emperor penguin and the smaller Adelie . The Weddell and several other species of seals are found on the ice along the edge of the continent and the large skua gull makes its nest near the penguin rookeries , where it can feed on penguin eggs and chicks . And that 's just about all the life to be found along the shores of the continent . There 's no wildlife at all in the interior of the continent . Ironically , though , this life-barren continent is surrounded by some of the richest water on earth , teeming with tiny forms of life . For the scientists studying the Antarctic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1974-75 year was a study of a huge ice sheet , almost the size of Mexico , which covers the Western Antarctic . Scientists say there is a " strong possibility " that the ice sheet is crumbling , and , if so , could be affecting the world 's sea levels and weather patterns , according to the researchers on the project . In another major project , two American parties this year continued deep drilling projects to find out more about what 's beneath the surface of the continent . These drilling projects on the Ross Ice Shelf and in the mysterious Dry Valley region will help answer questions about the remote history of the continent and the changes that are taking place there at the present . A third party was to attempt to drill a 100-meter hole near the South Pole to check on the pollution levels , volcanic activity and temperature patterns of the past thousands of years . The Antarctic continues to hold its appeal for American scien-tists because of several factors . Since the continent is still essen-tially in its natural state , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less natural  --  parts of the world can be measured . Antarctic baseline studies have compiled data on biological life in this remote region and on the effects of pollution on the wildlife and on the atmosphere . Also , the Antarctic is an ideal place to study certain atmospheric phenomena because the earth 's magnetic field returns to the globe at that point and because the continent provides solid rock and ice foundation for certain tests . It is also an earthquake-free part of the earth , for some reason . According to Jack Renirie , chief of public information for the National Science Foundation , the Antarctic research program has undergone some marked changes during the two decades since the IGY . Renirie describes the initial years there as a period of " discovery and reconnaissance . " " We were still discovering entire mountain ranges during that period , " he said . The initial period of research was characterized by traverses , soundings and mapping , and it lasted until the late Fifties and early Sixties when we had found out for the most part what was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end then and a period of individual scientific projects took up at that point to look in depth at some of the mysteries that had been uncovered by the discoveries . Gradually over the past few years , these individual projects have been superseded by large team projects , in which researchers of various disciplines and from different countries attack the remaining mysteries together . As an example , Renirie points to the International Antarctic Glaciological Project ( IAGP ) in which scientists from Australia , France , the U.S. and USSR are trying to determine " once and for all " whether the Antarctic ice is expanding , contracting or staying the same size . The United States has four scientific bases on the continent , the Soviet Union has six , Australia has two and New Zealand , the United Kingdom , South Africa , Chile , France , and Japan have one base each there . There were only a few hundred human beings on the continent during most of 1975 , and the figures remained exactly the same throughout the long winter months . The headquarters for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on the shore of the Ross Sea . Its summer population sometimes swells to 800 but during the austral winter the figure shrinks to around fifty . As I kicked around the streets of McMurdo , I felt as if I were in a frontier town . Although 95 percent of the Antarctic is covered year-round by ice , the streets were dusty here . It was bitterly cold during those December summer days , but no colder than many of the days I had survived in Chicago , and the Navy had decked me out in enough clothing to keep life bearable  --  if not comfortable . Functional-looking Jamesway huts lined the barren streets , serving as blisters of warmth and shelter for the scientists and support crews that held their own against the treacherous weather . There were huts for everything from labs to bars to chapels . Jamesway #109 was an enlisted men 's quarters and was labeled " 109th Drinking Squadron . " Nearby was another ragtag but labeled pretentiously " Playboy Club  --  Antarctic Div . " Both of them were a " stone 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Snows , " a converted Quonset hutplus-steeple built by the original Seabee crew in the mid-Fifties . It is the only church on the continent . The largest building in " Greater McMurdo " is a huge , nondescript building , painted a nondescript tan and labeled with a no ndescript name , " Personnel Facility . " It serves as living and eating quarters for much of the wintering-over population , and what it lacks in design impact it makes up for in size and warmth . The Personnel Facility sits on a rise overlooking the burg of McMurdo  --  a bland , symbolic castle overlooking a bland kingdom of lesser structures . These include a gym , warehouses , communications facilities , laboratories and other sorts of buildings needed to keep the world 's southernmost city from dying of cold or boredom . McMurdo Station is on Ross Island , the most important little piece of real estate within the Antarctic Circle . Robert Scott camped there before his fateful trip to the South Pole in 1912 . ( He was beaten to the Pole by only thirty-five days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long trek back . ) Another famous Antarctic explorer , Sir Ernest Shakelton , made his base on Ross Island , too . Ross Island marks the southernmost reach of the world 's oceans and is guarded by an active volcano , Mount Erebus . Although McMurdo Station , as the largest staging area , is the most important station for our operations on the continent , Scott-Amundsen Station at the Geographic South Pole is by far the best known to the public . The original facility was built to last three years and was completed there on January 23 , 1957 . Although it was built on the surface of the ice cap , its heat and weightacted like a hot nickel on ice and the entire station sank forty feet beneath the ice over the years . On January 9 , 1975 , a new modern South Pole facility was dedicated after four years of construction  --  a gigantic aluminum dome , 164 feet in diameter and five stories high . Within the dome are three buildings and another four structures are connected by enclosed walkways . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it is moving on top of its ice cap toward the Pole at a steady rate . In five years it will be directly over the South Pole and in ten years it will be a quarter of a mile on the other side . The South Pole is one of the strangest places on earth . It sits on a flat , monotonous ice cap that stretches in all directions as far as the eye can see , even from an aircraft high over the Pole . The runway that serves it is 1,400 feet long with 2,000 miles of overrun . The South Pole station sits 9,184 feet above the land . Everything in between is solid ice . Consider the novelty of standing at the South Pole . As I simply walked around the barber pole marker , I passed from today into yesterday and back into tomorrow by walking through every time zone . I walked " around the world " in a couple of seconds . One 's watch is always right at the Pole , even if it is stopped , since it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time where all of the time lines converge . Every direction is north , and that means that every wind is a north wind . In addition to the large McMurdo base at the edge of the continent and the Amundsen-Scott base at the South Pole , there are two bases on the Palmer Peninsula , on the side of the continent toward South Amer-lea . A cluster of stations of various Antarctic Treaty nations dot the tip of the peninsula , including the United States 's Palmer Station . Palmer Station is so far away from the other American bases that it is supplied from South America rather than from the New Zealand-to-McMurdo route . At the base of the Palmer Peninsula , 600 miles away , is the newest American base , Siple Sta-tion , named for the late American giant of Antarctic re-search , Dr. Paul A. Siple . The four bases are peopled with men and women of the U.S. Antarctic Research Program , civilian maintenance crews and person . nel of the U.S. Navy Operation Deep Freeze command . This Navy command is the strangest in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cooperation with the staffs of other nations , including the Soviets , and the totally peaceful mission of the operations . Operation Deep Freeze Captain Eugene W. Van Reeth is Commander , U.S. Naval Support Force , Antarctica , and is a true O.A.E. ( Old Antarctic Explorer , as the experienced hands are called there ) , having spent six years of his t w e my-seven-year career in various Antarctic assignments . The air transport LC-130 Hercules aircraft and UH1N Huey helicopters are the lifeline of the Antarctic bases , and the squadron 's crack pararescue team stands ready to parachute in on any scientific party that should become trapped in an area where the aircraft ca n't land . But when the brief Antarctic summer ends in February , most of the support force flies north to Southern California for the winter to get their equipment back in shape for another assault on the continent the following year . Those eighty-five Americans who remained at the four outposts of McMurdo , Pole , Siple and Palmer were sealed off from the rest of their own planet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heat inside and the cold outside of their life-supporting buildings , dreaming of the day they 'd see the sun again , and keeping in touch with their families by shortwave radio . Because of them , the Stars and Stripes still fly on Antarctica .
