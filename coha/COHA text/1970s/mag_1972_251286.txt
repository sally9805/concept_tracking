Turkish Prime Minister Nihat Erim was not terribly surprised last week when a message from President Cevdet Sunay was rushed to him at Ankara airport . Erim had just said goodbye to Soviet President Nikolai V. Podgorny , who flew home after a week of inconclusive negotiations over a proposed Soviet-Turkish friendship treaty . Ceremonies completed , Erim tore open the envelope to learn that he was being relieved as Prime Minister because of his " extreme fatigue . " <P> Actually , Erim had been trying to resign for more than a week ; he had agreed to remain on the job only to handle the Podgorny visit . Whatever fatigue he felt was caused by his unsuccessful efforts to deal with an obstructionist Parliament that refused to approve his tax-and land-reform measures and sought to prevent him from using the alternative-ruling by decree . <P> Erim 's resignation and Sunay 's search for a successor who would continue the departed Prime Minister 's " above party " approach to government produced a new political crisis for Turkey . For 50 years the country has been effectively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last year turned out Prime Minister Suleyman Demirel ( for not cracking down hard enough on dissenters ) and installed the then virtually unknown Erim , a former law professor . Officially , Turkey is a parliamentary democracy , but the four main parties are so fractiously divided that little in the way of creative change is possible . Because Parliament so strongly opposed his reform programs , Erim had tried to resign twice before receiving last week 's letter from the <P> President . Both times the army persuaded him to stay on . <P> Adding to Turkey 's political malaise is the increasing activity of left-wing urban guerrilla groups , many of them composed of students or graduates from the universities . The guerrillas last year carried out a campaign of violence that culminated in the kidnap-murder of Israeli Consul General Ephraim Elrom . Terrorist Leader Mahir Cayan and a cadre of guerrillas from an organization called the Turkish People 's Liberation Army were convicted of that crime and were in Istanbul 's Maltepe Prison awaiting final sentencing . But they escaped four months ago , kidnaped three NATO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took them to a remote mountain village . As army troops closed in , the hostages were shot ; all but one of the guerrillas were killed in a subsequent Shootout . <P> The murders of the NATO technicians set off a renewed army crackdown on dissent . Since then , 107 leftists have been arrested . Generals now hold key positions in the police , the state radio and television networks and the government-run airline . Some Turkish intellectuals feel that the military has been somewhat excessive in its zeal to preserve order . The army commander of Ankara , for instance , closed down a display of pictures of President Nixon 's China visit , sponsored by the Turkish-American Association . Showings of two U.S. movie classics , Citizen Kane and The Grapes of Wrath , were halted because their themes were considered too controversial . Reports persist that some antigovernment critics who were jailed in the crackdown have been tortured .
