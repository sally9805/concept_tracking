To Columnist Joseph Kraft , " President Nixon is risking almost everything to gain practically nothing " because the best the Administration can achieve is a " fig leaf for defeat . " On the same day 's Washington Post op-edit page , Rowland Evans and Robert Novak called the President 's latest move " dangerously high-risk poker , " but speculated that the pot could be rewarding in two ways : by thwarting a fresh Communist offensive in the fall while keeping the Russians far enough below the boiling point to save a Moscow-Washington agreement on nuclear-arms limitations . The Washington Star , meanwhile , declared that " the Rubicon is crossed " ; therefore , " the place of this newspaper is behind the President of the United States . " <P> In the wake of Nixon 's announcement about sealing North Vietnamese ports and borders while offering new peace terms , columnists and editorialists responded last week with more than the usual thunder pro and con . Much of the language on both sides was tougher than usual . Some of it sounded as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Nixon has put it all on the line-the war , the election , his future and peace in our time , " intoned the Chicago Daily News . " From the bottom of our hearts , we hope it works . " As usual , the opposition Tribune saw it differently : " Nixon is taking a risk , but it still looks like a soundly calculated one . " The same sort of editorial schizophrenia prevailed in Detroit , where the News praised " the action that took guts , " while the Knight Free Press saw Nixon 's televised talk as " an incredible nightmare " ' and asked : " Is he so insecure that he is willing to see the world blown to smithereens to avoid being the first President to lose a war ? " <P> Rising to white heat , the New York <P> Times called on Congress to " curb and control " the Executive Branch : " Nixon is pushing the country very near to a constitutional crisis ; Congress can yet save the President from himself and the nation from disaster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ columnist , James Reston , pointed out that Nixon 's " new and more specific peace terms may be overlooked and underestimated " in all the rhetoric . " There is nothing here about keeping American air and naval power in Viet Nam , or defending the Thieu government to the end . " <P> Sarcasm . One paper that switched stands was the Denver Post . Noting that " we have consistently supported President Nixon 's efforts to wind down the war and bring home American troops , " the Post concluded that " it is not worth risking a wider war in order to save Saigon . The President has gone too far , and we hope he can find a way back . " The Boston Globe resorted to sarcasm : " We hope that as the crisis develops and we approach the brink of disaster , those on the other side will show as much feeling for basic humanity as the Administration has for saving face .
