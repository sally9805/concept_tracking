SCENE : A bare stage except for an evil-looking black chair with silver studs and a very high back , something like an Egyptian Pharaoh 's throne but simple , centre stage . In the dark , heavy lurking Rock and Roll starts low and builds as the lights come up . The band should be hidden . The sound should be like " Heroin " by the Velvet Underground . When the lights are up full , HOSS enters in black rocker gear with silver studs and black kid gloves . He holds a microphone . He should look like a mean Rip Torn but a little younger . He takes the stage and sings " The Way Things Are . " The words of the song should be understood so the band has to back off on volume when he starts singing . " The Way Things Are " HOSS You may think every picture you see is a true history of the way things used to be or the way things areWhile you 're ridin ' in your radio or walkin ' through the late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just do n't know you just do n't knowSo here 's another illusion to add to your confusion Of the way things areEverybody 's doin ' time for everybody else 's crime and I ca n't swim for the waves in the oceanAll the heroes is dyin ' like flies they say it 's a sign a ' the timesAnd everybody 's walkin ' asleep eyes open  --  eyes open So here 's another sleep-walkin ' dreamA livin ' talkin ' show of the way things seemI used to believe in rhythm and bluesAlways wore my blue suede shoesNew everything I do goes down in doubt But sometimes in the blackest night I can see a little light That 's the only thing that keeps me rockin '  --  keeps me rockin ' So here 's another fantasyAbout the way things seem to be to me . ( He finishes the song and throws down the microphone and yells off stage . ) BECKY Lou ! ( BECKY comes on in black rock and roll gear . She 's very tall and blonde . She holds two black satchels , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bags. ) p. 3 BECKY LOU Ready just about . HOSS Let 's have a look at the gear . ( BECKY sets the bags down on the floor and opens them . She pulls out a black velvet piece of cloth and lays it carefully on the floor then begins to take out pearl-handled revolvers , pistols , derringers and rifles with scopes , shotguns broken down . All the weapons should look really beautiful and clean . She sets them carefully on the velvet cloth . HOSS pick up the rifles and handles them like a pro , cocking them and looking down the barrel through the scope , checking out the chambers on the pistols and running his hands over them as though they were alive . ) How 's the Maserati ? BECKY LOU Clean . Greased like a bullet . Cheyenne took it up to 180 on the Ventura Freeway then backed her right down . Said she did n't bark once . HOSS Good . About time he stopped them quarter-mile orgasms . They were rippin ' her up . Got ta let the gas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Likes a full-tilt feel . BECKY LOU Cheyenne 's hungry for long distance now . Could n't hold him back with nails . Got lead in his gas foot . HOSS These look nice and blue . Did the Jeweler check ' em out ? BECKY LOU Yeah , Hoss . Everything 's taken care of . p. 4 HOSS Good . Now we can boogie . BECKY LOU What 's the moon chart say ? HOSS Do n't ask me ! I hired a fucking star-man . A gazer . What the fuck 's he been doin ' up there . BECKY LOU I do n't know . Last I knew it was the next first quarter moon . That 's when he said things 'd be right . HOSS Get that fucker down here ! I wan na see him . I gave him thirteen grand to get this chart in line . Tell him to get his ass down here ! BECKY LOU O.K. , O.K. ( She exits , HOSS caresses the guns . ) HOSS That fuckin ' Scorpion 's gon na crawl if this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can feel it 's right . I need the points ! Ca n't they see that ! I 'm winning in three fucking States ! I 'm controlling more borders than any a ' them punk Markers . The El Camino Boys . Bunch a ' fuckin ' punks . GET THAT FUCKER DOWN HERE ! ! ! ( STAR-MAN enters with BECKY . He 's dressed in silver but should n't look like Star Trek , more contemporary silver . ) O.K. , slick face , what 's the scoop . Can we move now ? STAR-MAN Pretty risky , Hoss . HOSS I knew it ! I knew it ! You fuckin ' creep ! Every time we get hot to trot you throw on the ice water . Whatsa matter now . p. 5 STAR-MAN Venus is entering Scorpio . HOSS I do n't give a shit if it 's entering Brigitte Bardot . I 'm ready for a kill ! STAR-MAN You 'll blow it . HOSS I 'll blow it . What do you know . I 've always moved on a sixth sense . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you never went against the charts before . HOSS Fuck before . This time I feel it . I can smell blood . It 's right . The time is right ! I 'm fallin ' behind . Maybe you do n't understand that . STAR-MAN Not true , Hoss . The El Caminos are about six points off the pace . Mojo Root Force is the only one close enough to even worry about . HOSS Mojo ? That fruit ? What 'd he knock over ? STAR-MAN Vegas , Hoss . He rolled the big one . HOSS Vegas ! He ca n't take Vegas , that 's my mark ! That 's against the code ! STAR-MAN He took it . HOSS I do n't believe it . BECKY LOU We picked it up on the bleeper . HOSS When ? How come I 'm the last to find out ? p. 6 STAR-MAN We thought it 'd rattle you too much . HOSS When did it happen ! STAR-MAN This morning from what the teleprompters read . HOSS I 'm gon na get that chump . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do that . He knew Vegas was on my ticket . He 's trying to shake me . He thinks I 'll just jump borders and try suburban shots . Well he 's fuckin ' crazy . I 'm gon na roll him good . BECKY LOU You ca n't go against the code , Hoss . Once a Marker strikes and sets up colors , that 's his turf . You ca n't strike claimed turf . They 'll throw you out of the game . HOSS He did it ! He took my mark . It was on my ticket , goddamnit ! STAR-MAN He can just claim his wave system blew and he did n't find out till too late . HOSS Well he 's gon na find out now . I 'll get a fleet together and wipe him out . BECKY LOU But , Hoss , you 'll be forced to change class . You wo n't have solo rights no more . You 'll be a gang man . A punk . HOSS I do n't care . I want that fuckin ' gold record @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ STAR-MAN You got ta hold steady , Hoss . This is a tender time . The wrong move 'll throw you back a year or more . You ca n't afford that now . The charts are moving too fast . Every week there 's a new star . You do n't wan na be a fly-by-night mug in the crowd . You want something durable , something lasting . How 're you gon na cop an immortal shot if you give up soloing and go into a gang war . They 'll rip you up in a night . Sure you 'll have a few moments of global glow , maybe even an interplanetary flash . But it wo n't last , Hoss , it wo n't last . p. 7 BECKY LOU He 's right , Hoss . HOSS O.K. , O.K. I 'm just gettin ' hungry that 's all . I need a kill . I have n't had a kill for months now . You know what that 's like . I got ta kill . It 's my whole life . If I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself . It 's not good . I was born to kill . STAR-MAN Nobody knows that better than us , Hoss . But you got ta listen to management . That 's what we 're here for . To advise and direct . Without us you 'd be just like a mad dog again . Ca n't you remember what that was like . HOSS Yeah , yeah ! Go away now . Go on ! I wan na be alone with Becky . STAR-MAN O.K. Just try and take it easy . I know you were wired for a big kill but your time is coming . Do n't forget that . HOSS Yeah , all right . Beat it ! ( STAR-MAN exits leaving HOSS alone with BECKY . He looks around the stage dejected . He kicks at the guns and pulls off his gloves . ) I 'm too old fashioned . That 's it . Got ta kick out the scruples . Go against the code . That 's what they used to do . The big ones . Dylan , Jagger , Townsend . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . BECKY LOU But they were playin ' pussy , Hoss . They were n't killers You 're a killer , man . You 're in the big time . p. 8 HOSS So were they . My Pa told me what it was like . They were killers in their day too . Cold killers . BECKY LOU Come on . You 're talkin ' treason against the game . You could get the slammer for less than that . HOSS Fuck ' em . I know my power . I can go on Gypsy Kill and still gain status . There 's a whole underground movement going on . There 's a lot of Gypsy Markers comin ' up . BECKY LOU Why do you wan na throw everything away . You were always suicidal like that . Right from the start . HOSS It 's part of my nature . BECKY LOU That 's what we saved you from , your nature . Maybe you forgot that . When we first landed you , you were a complete beast of nature . A sideways killer . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfection because we saw in you a true genius killer . A killer to end them all . A killer 's killer . HOSS Aw fuck off . I do n't believe that shit no more . That stuff is for schoolies . Sure I 'm good . I might even be great but I ai n't no genius . Genius is something outside the game . The game ca n't contain a true genius . It 's too small . The next genius is gon na be a Gypsy Killer . I can feel it . I know it 's goin ' down right now . We do n't have the whole picture . We 're too successful We 're insulated from what 's really happening by our own fame . p. 9 BECKY LOU You 're really trying to self-destruct are n't you ? Whatsa matter , you ca n't take fame no more ? You ca n't hold down the pressure circuits ? Maybe you need a good lay or two . HOSS Your ass . I can handle the image like a fuckin ' jockey . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more . I dropped the blinkers . BECKY LOU You 're not gettin ' buck fever are ya ' ? HOSS Get outa ' here ! BECKY LOU Come on . Put it in fourth for a while , Hoss . Cruise it . You can afford to take it easy . HOSS GET THE FUCK OUTA ' HERE ! ! ! BECKY LOU O.K. , O.K. I 'm your friend . Remember ? HOSS Yeah , sure . BECKY LOU I am . You 're in a tough racket . The toughest . But now ai n't the time to crack . You 're knockin ' at the door , Hoss . You got ta hold on . Once you get the gold then you can back off . But not now . HOSS I 'm not backin ' off . I 'm just havin ' a doubt dose . BECKY LOU Maybe I should call a D.J . One a ' the big ones . Then you could sit down with him and he could lay the chart out right in front of you . Show you exactly where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea . Good . Go get one . Get Galactic Jack and his Railroad Track . Tell him to bring his latest charts . Go on ! BECKY LOU O.K. I 'll be back . ( She exits . HOSS stalks around the stage building up his confidence . ) HOSS She 's right ! She 's right goddamnit ! I 'm so fucking close . Knockin ' at the door . I ca n't chicken out of it now . This is my last chance . I 'm gettin ' old . I ca n't do a Lee Marvin in the late sixties . I ca n't pull that number off . I 've stomped too many heads . I 'm past shitkicker class now . Past the rumble . I 'm in the big time . Really big . It 's now or never . Come on , Hoss , be a killer , man . Be a killer ! ( Music starts . He sings " Cold Killer . " ) " Cold Killer " I 'm a cold killer Mama  --  I got blood on my jeansI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my pockets and a razor in my bootYou better watch it do n't get you  --  It 's faster'n you can shootI got the fastest action in East L.A. I got the fastest action in San BerdooAnd if you do n't believe it lemme shoot it to you Now watch me slide into power glide  --  supercharged down the lineThere ai n't no way for you to hide from the killer 's eyeMy silver studs , my black kid gloves make you cry insideBut there ai n't no way for you to hide from the killer 's eye I 'm a cold killer Mama  --  and I 've earned my tattooI got a Pachooko cross hangin ' over you I got whiplash magic and a rattlesnake tongueMy John the Conqueroot says I 'm the cold gun Now watch me slide into power glide supercharged down the lineThere ai n't no way for you to hide from the killer 's eyeMy silver studs , my black kid gloves make you cry insideBut there ai n't no way for you to hide from the killer 's eye . ( The song ends . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's white and dressed like a 42nd Street pimp , pink shirt , black tie , black patent leather shoes , white panama straw hat and a flash suit . He talks like Wolfman Jack and carries a bundle of huge charts . ) Ah ! The man . Galactic Jack and his Railroad Track . p. 11 GALACTIC JACK That 's me , Jim . Heavy duty and on the whim . Back flappin ' , side trackin ' , finger poppin ' , reelin ' rockin ' with the tips on the picks in the great killer race . All tricks , no sale , no avail . It 's in the can and on the lam . Grease it , daddyo ! ( He holds out his hand palm up for HOSS to give him five . HOSS holds back . ) HOSS Back down , Jack . Just give it me straight . Am I risin ' or fallin ' . GALACTIC JACK A shootin ' star , baby . High flyin ' and no jivin ' . You is off to number nine . HOSS Show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the floor . BECKY LOU Shall I get ya 'll some drinks ? HOSS Yeah . Tequila Gold . What do you take , Jack ? GALACTIC JACK Not me , baby . I 'm runnin ' reds all down the spine his chart on the floor . HOSS and JACK crouch down to get a close inspection . ) GALACTIC JACK O.K. Here 's the stand on the national band . The game 's clean now . Solo is the word . Gang war is takin ' a back seat . The Low Riders are outa ' the picture and you is in , Jim . In like a stone winner . p. 12 HOSS Do n't type it up , Jack . Just show me how it 's movin ' . I was ready to take Nevada clean and that meathead Mojo Root Force rolled Vegas . GALACTIC JACK Yeah I heard that . Supposed to be on your ticket too . Bad news . HOSS He ca n't get away with that can he ? GALACTIC JACK I ca n't dope them sheets , Hoss . You 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight to the Keepers . HOSS I ca n't go to the game Keepers . They 'll ask for an itinerary and question past kills . I ca n't afford a penalty now . I need every point . GALACTIC JACK Well lookee here . There 's movement all around but no numero uno . That 's what they 're backin ' their chips on you for , boy . The bookies got you two to one . HOSS That close ? GALACTIC JACK All of'em runnin ' it down to you . There 's Little Willard from the East in his formula Lotus . Fast machine . Doin ' O.K. with a stainless steel Baretta . HOSS Willard 's solo now ? GALACTIC JACK Yeah but no threat . Just a front runner . Lots a ' early speed but ca n't go the distance . Here 's one outa Tupalo called Studie Willcock . Drivin ' a hot Merc , dual cams , Chrysler through and through . Fast but not deadly . He 's offered four in a week and almost had Arkansas wrapped up but he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You is the coldest on the circuit . p. 13 HOSS What about this mark ? ( pointing at the charts ) GALACTIC JACK Oh yeah , that 's Grease Jam . Got a supercharged Mini Cooper . Takes the corners . Tried a hit on St. Paul and almost had Minnesota to its knees when he blew a head gasket . Some say he 's even been offed by the El Caminos . HOSS Those guys are pressin ' it pretty hard . They 're gon na get blown off sooner or later . GALACTIC JACK No doubt . No need to pout . The course is clear . Maybe a few Gypsy Killers comin ' into the picture but nothin ' to fret your set . HOSS Gypsies ? Where ? I knew it . I got a feeling . GALACTIC JACK Just some side bets . They go anonymous ' cause ' a the code . One slip and they is pissed . You can dig it . They 's playin ' with the king fire . HOSS But they got a following right ? They 're growing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet , man . Some poles do n't even mention their kills for fear of the Keepers comin ' down on ' em . I could maybe sound some flies for ya ' . See if I could whiff some sniff on that action . HOSS Yeah , do . GALACTIC JACK What 's the keen to the Gypsy scene . These boys are losin ' to the cruisin ' baby . p. 14 HOSS They 've got time on their side . Ca n't you see that . The youth 's goin ' to ' em . The kids are flocking to Gypsy Kills . It 's a market opening up , Jack . I got a feeling . I know they 're on their way in and we 're going out . We 're gettin ' old , Jack . GALACTIC JACK You just got the buggered blues , man . You been talkin ' to the wrong visions . You got ta get a head set . Put yer ears on straight . Zoot yerself down , boy . These Gypsies is committin ' suicide . We got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Keepers whimsy it all they do is scratch ' em out . Simple . They 're losers , man . The bookies do n't even look past their left shoulder at a Gypsy Mark . They wo n't last , man . Believe me . HOSS I do n't know . There 's power there . Full blown . GALACTIC JACK They do n't know the ropes , man . Rules is out . They 're into slaughter straight off . Not a clean kill in the bunch . HOSS But they got balls . They 're on their own . GALACTIC JACK So are you . Solo 's the payolo . HOSS But I 'm inside and they 're out . They could unseat us all . GALACTIC JACK Not a King . The crown sticks where it fits and right now it looks about your size . HOSS What if they turned the game against us . What if they started marking us ! p. 15 GALACTIC JACK That 's revolution , man . HOSS You hit it . GALACTIC JACK Old time shuffle . Do n't stand a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we started ai n't it . We went up against the Dudes . Wiped ' em out . GALACTIC JACK The Dudes were n't pros , man . You got ta see where you stand . I do believe you is tastin ' fear . Runnin ' scared . These Gypsies is just muckrakers . Second hand , one night stand . They ai n't worth shit on shinola in your league . Dig yourself on the flip side . You 're number one with a bullet and you ai n't even got the needle in the groove . HOSS We 'll see . Somethin 's goin ' down big out there . The shit 's gon na hit the fan before we can get to the bank . GALACTIC JACK Take a deep knee bend , Hoss . It 's just the pre-victory shakes . Tomorrow you 'll have the gold in your hand . The bigee . Do n't be shy , I tell no lie . Catch ya ' on the re-bop . Say bye and keep the slide greased down . HOSS Yeah . Thanks . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talks to himself. ) ( to himself ) Come on , come on . Confidence , man . Confidence . Do n't go on the skids now . Keep it together . Tighten down . Talk it out . Quit jumpin ' at shadows . They got you goose bumped and they ai n't even present . Put yourself in their place . They got nothin ' . You got it all . All the chips . Come on dice ! Come on dice ! That 's it . Roll ' em sweet . The sweet machine . Candy in the gas tank . Floor it . Now you got the wheel . Take it . Take it ! ( BECKY enters with the drink . HOSS catches himself. ) p. 16 BECKY LOU What happened to Jack ? HOSS We ran the session . BECKY LOU Here 's your drink . HOSS Thanks . Listen , Becky , is Cheyenne ready to roll ? BECKY LOU Yeah . He 's hot . Why ? HOSS Maybe we could just do a cruise . No action . Just some scouting . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This place is drivin ' me nuts . BECKY LOU Too dangerous , Hoss . We just got word that Eyes sussed somebody 's marked you . HOSS What ! Marked me ? Who ? BECKY LOU One a ' the Gypsies . HOSS It 's all comin ' down like I said . I must be top gun then . BECKY LOU That 's it . HOSS They got ta be fools , man . A Gypsy 's marked me ? BECKY LOU That 's the word from Eyes . HOSS Where is he ? BECKY LOU Vegas . HOSS Vegas ? Oh now I get it . Mojo . He 's hired a Gypsy to off me clean . That 's it . That fuckin ' chicken shit . I 'm gon na blast him good . Does n't have the balls to come down to me . Got ta hire a Gypsy . p. 17 BECKY LOU Might be just a renegade solo , Hoss . They 're all lookin ' to put you under . You 're the main trigger . The word 's out . HOSS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slip-streamin ' my time . Takin ' my marks and hirin ' amateurs to rub me out . It 's a gang shot . They 're workin ' doubles . I got ta team up now . It 's down to that . I got ta get ahold a ' Little Willard . Get him on the line . BECKY LOU Hoss , do n't fly off , man . You 're safe here . HOSS Safe ! Safe and amputated from the neck down ! I 'm a Marker man , not a desk clerk . Get fucking Willard to the phone ! And tell Cheyenne to come in here ! ( BECKY exits ) O.K. Now the picture brightens . I can play for high stakes now . I can draw to the straight , outside or in . I 'm ready to take on any a ' these flash heads . Vegas is mine , man . It belongs in my pocket . The West is mine . I could even take on the Keepers . That 's it . I 'll live outside the fucking law altogether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why did n't I think a ' that before ! ( CHEYENNE enters in green velvet with silver boots and racing gloves . ) CHEYENNE You want me , Hoss ? HOSS Yeah ! Yeah I want you ! You 're my main man . ( He gives CHEYENNE a bear hug . ) Listen , Cheyenne , we done a lotta ' marks in our time . Right ? p. 18 CHEYENNE Yeah . HOSS Good clean kills . Honest kills . But now the times are changin ' . The race is deadly . Mojo Root Force is movin ' in on turf marks and tryin ' to put me out with a Gypsy . CHEYENNE A Gypsy ? HOSS Yeah . CHEYENNE They ca n't do that . It 's against the code . HOSS Fuck the code . Nobody 's playin ' by the rules no more . We been suckers to the code for too long now . Now we move outside . You remember Little Willard ? CHEYENNE East Coast . Drove a Galaxie . Into Remington over and unders . HOSS Yeah . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Formula 2 and a Baretta . CHEYENNE Sounds mean . HOSS He is , man . And I trust him . He was right with me when we took off the Dudes . Becky 's on the phone to him now . He 's our man . Just him and us . CHEYENNE But Root Force has probably got Vegas locked up , Hoss . It 's gon na be hard penetration . HOSS We rolled Phoenix did n't we ? CHEYENNE Yeah . HOSS Tucson ? p. 19 CHEYENNE Yeah . HOSS San Berdoo ? CHEYENNE Yeah . HOSS So Vegas ai n't no Fort Knox . CHEYENNE So it 's back to the rumble ? HOSS Temporary . Just temporary . We ca n't sit back and let the good times roll when the game 's breakin ' down . CHEYENNE I do't know . I love the game , Hoss . I ai n't hot to . go back to gang war . HOSS We got to now ! Otherwise we 're down the tubes . CHEYENNE What about the Keepers ? HOSS Fuck them too . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't like it . HOSS The critics ! They 're outside , man . They do n't know what 's goin ' on . CHEYENNE What about our reputation . We worked hard to get where we are . I 'm not ready to throw that away . I want a taste a ' that gold . HOSS I 'm surrounded by assholes ! Ca n't you see what 's happened to us . We ai n't Markers no more . We ai n't even Rockers . We 're punk chumps cowering under the Keepers and the Refs and the critics and the public eye . We ai n't free no more ! Goddamnit ! We ai n't flyin ' in the eye of contempt . We 've become respectable and safe . Soft , mushy chewable ass lickers . What 's happened to our killer heart . What 's happened to our blind fucking courage ! Cheyenne , we ai n't got much time , man . We were warriors once . p. 20 CHEYENNE That was a long time ago . HOSS Then you 're backing down ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( CHEYENNE exits ) HOSS God ! Goddamnit ! This is gettin ' weird now . Solo ai n't the word for it . It 's gettin ' lonely as an ocean in here . My driver 's gone against me and my time 's runnin ' thin . Little Willard 's my last chance . Him and me . He 's runnin ' without a driver , so can I. The two of us . Just the two of us . That 's enough against the Root Force . He 's East Coast though . Maybe he do n't know the Western Ropes . He could learn it . We 'll cruise the action . He 'll pick up the streets . Cheyenne knows the West though . Born and raised like me . Backyard schoolin ' . Goddamn ! Why 's he have to go soft now ! Why now ! ( BECKY enters ) You get Willard ? BECKY LOU No . HOSS How come ! I need him bad . Keep tryin ' ! ! BECKY LOU He 's dead , Hoss . Shot himself in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His Rep. They just found him in New Haven slumped over an intersection . They say his car was still runnin ' . HOSS Why 'd he go and do that ? He was in the top ten and risin ' . p. 21 BECKY LOU Could n't take it I guess . Too vulnerable . They found a pound of Meth in the back seat . HOSS Becky , I 'm marked . What the fuck am I gon na do ? I ca n't just sit here and wait for him to come . BECKY LOU Least you 'll know he 's comin ' . If you go out cruisin ' he 's liable to strike anywhere , any time . A Gypsy 's got the jump on you that way . HOSS What if I busted into Vegas myself ? Just me . They 'd never expect somethin ' like that . I could take off Mojo and split before they knew what happened . BECKY LOU You 're dealin ' with a pack now , man . It ai n't one against one no more . HOSS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wait him out . Meet him on a singles match and bounce him hard . Challenge him . HOSS What if he snipes me ? BECKY LOU We got the watch out . We 'll give him the usher routine . Say that you 've been expecting him . That 'll challenge his pride . Then fight him with shivs . HOSS Shivs ! I ai n't used a blade for over ten years . I 'm out of practice . BECKY LOU Practice up . I 'll get you a set and a dummy . p. 22 HOSS O.K. And call in the Doc . I need a good shot . BECKY LOU Good . ( She exits . HOSS stalks the stage ) HOSS Backed into a fucking box . I ca n't believe it . Things have changed that much . They do n't even apprentice no more . Just mark for the big one . No respect no more . When I was that age I 'd sell my leathers to get a crack at a good teacher . I would . And I had some a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the game no more . There 's no game . It 's just back to how it was . Rolling night clubs , strip joints . Bustin ' up poker games . Zip guns in the junk yard . Rock fights , dirt clods , bustin ' windows . Vandals , juvies , West Side Story . Ca n't they see where they 're goin ' ! Without a code it 's just crime . No art involved . No technique , finesse . No sense of mastery . The touch is gone . ( BECKY enters with DOC who is dressed in red . BECKY has two knives and a dummy which she sets up centre stage right . HOSS sits in his chair . DOC has a syringe and a vial of dope and a rubber surgical hose . HOSS rolls his sleeve up and DOC goes about shooting him up . ) Oh , Doc , it 's good to see ya ' . I 'm in need . I 'm under the gun , Doc . DOC Yeah . Things are tough now . This 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what do you think about Gypsy Kills . Do you think it 's ethical ? DOC Have n't thought too much about it actually . I suppose it was bound to happen . Once I remember this early Gypsy . I guess you 'd call him a Gypsy now but at the time he was just a hard luck fella name a'Doc Carter . Little got to be known of the man on account a ' the fact that he was ridin ' a certain William F. Cody 's shirttail all through the West , and , for that matter , half around the planet . Anyhow , ole Doc came to be known as the " Spirit Gun of the West " and a well-deserved title it was , too . That boy could shoot the hump off a buffalo on the backside of a nickel at a hundred paces . To this very day his saddle is settin ' in some musty ole Wyoming museum decorated with a hundred silver coins . Each one shot through and through with his Colt .45 . And all surroundin ' this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ F. Cody fella pallin ' it up with the Indians . Ole Doc never got out from behind the shadow a ' that Cody . But I suppose nowadays he 'd just take over the whole show . Do n't rightly know what made me think a ' that . Just popped into my mind . HOSS Yeah . It 's just funny finding myself on the other side . BECKY LOU It ai n't revolution , man . This Gypsy 's a hired trigger from Mojo . He ai n't a martyr . p. 24 HOSS But he works outside the code . BECKY LOU Fuck it . All you got ta worry about is gettin ' him before he gets you . HOSS You were one of the ones who taught me the code . Now you can throw it away like that . BECKY LOU It 's back down to survival , Hoss . Temporary suspension . That 's all . HOSS I do n't think so . I think the whole system 's gettin ' shot to shit . I think the code 's going down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of honor . I can see it comin ' . DOC There . That ought a ' do you for a while . HOSS Thanks , Doc . DOC If you need any crystal later just call me down . HOSS Thanks , man . ( DOC exits ) BECKY LOU You wan na try these out ? ( She offers the knives to HOSS .

HOSS You remember the El Monte Legion Stadium ? p. 25 BECKY LOU Yeah ? HOSS Ripple Wine ? BECKY LOU Yeah . HOSS The Coasters ? BECKY LOU ( she sings a snatch ) " Take out the papers and the trash or you do n't get no spendin ' cash . " HOSS ( sings ) " Just tell your hoodlum friend outside . You ai n't got time to take a ride . " BECKY LOU " Yackety yack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( They laugh . HOSS stops himself . ) Do n't let me go too soft . BECKY LOU Why not . You 've earned it . HOSS Earned it ? I ai n't earned nothin ' . Everything just happened . Just fell like cards . I never made a choice . BECKY LOU But you 're here now . A hero . All those losers out there barkin ' at the moon . HOSS But where am I goin ' ? The future 's just like the past . BECKY LOU You got ta believe , Hoss . HOSS In what ? BECKY LOU Power . That 's all there is . The power of the machine . The killer Machine . That 's what you live and die for . That 's what you wake up for . Every breath you take you breathe the power . You live the power . You are the power . p. 26 HOSS Then why do I feel so weak ! BECKY LOU The knife 's got ta be pulled out before you can stab again . The gun 's got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stored . You 're just gettin'a trickle charge now . The ignition 's got ta turn yet . HOSS Yeah . It 's just hard to wait . BECKY LOU It 's harder for movers . You 're a mover , Hoss . Some people , all they do is wait . HOSS Maybe I should take a ramble . BECKY LOU Where to ? HOSS Anywhere . Just to get out for a while . BECKY LOU You carry your gun wherever you go . HOSS Listen , maybe I should go on the lam . BECKY LOU Are you crazy ? HOSS No , I 'm serious . I 'm gettin ' too old for this . I need some peace . BECKY LOU Do you know what it 's like out there , outside the game ? You would n't recognize it . HOSS What about New York ? Second Avenue . BECKY LOU What Second Avenue ? There ai n't no Second Avenue . They 're all zoned out . You would n't stand a snowball 's chance in hell of makin'it outside the game . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wild animal as a pet then turnin ' him back loose again . You could n't cope , Hoss. p. 27 HOSS I did it once . I was good on the streets . I was a true hustler . BECKY LOU The streets are controlled by the packs . They got it locked up . The packs are controlled by the gangs . The gangs and the Low Riders . They 're controlled by cross syndicates . The next step is the Keepers . HOSS What about the country . Ai n't there any farmers left , ranchers , cowboys , open space ? Nobody just liven ' their life . BECKY LOU You ai n't playin ' with a full deck , Hoss . All that 's gone . That 's old time boogie . The only way to be an individual is in the game . You 're it . You 're on top . You 're free . HOSS What free ! How free ! I 'm tearin ' myself inside out from this fuckin ' sport . That 's free ? That 's being alive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fun . I wan na be a fuck off again . I do n't wan na compete no more . BECKY LOU And what about the kill ? You do n't need that ? HOSS I do n't know , maybe not . Maybe I could live without it . BECKY LOU You 're talkin ' loser now , baby . HOSS Maybe so . Maybe I am a loser . Maybe we 're all fuckin ' losers . I do n't care no more . BECKY LOU What about the gold record . You do n't need that ? p. 28 HOSS I do n't know ! I just wan na back off for a while . I ca n't think straight . I need a change . A vacation or something . BECKY LOU Maybe so . I heard about a place , an island where they do n't play the game . Everybody 's on downers all day . HOSS That sounds good . What about that . Maybe you could find out for me . All I need is a week or two . Just to rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I can do . HOSS Jesus . How 'd I get like this ? BECKY LOU It 'll pass . HOSS Sing me a song or somethin ' , would ya ?

We just got tapped that the Gypsy 's made it through zone five . He 's headed this way . HOSS Already ? What 's he drivin ' ? CHEYENNE You wo n't believe this . A ' 58 black Impala , fuel injected , bored and stroked , full blown Vet underneath . HOSS I 'm gon na like this dude . O.K. let him through . CHEYENNE All the way ? HOSS Yeah . Stop him at the mote and sound him on a shiv duel . CHEYENNE Shivs ? You ai n't in shape for blades , Hoss . HOSS I can handle it . Walk on . CHEYENNE O.K. ( he exits ) BECKY LOU Good . He 's finally comin ' . This 'll get ya ' back on your feet , Hoss . Your waitin ' time is over . HOSS Go tell the Doc I want some snow . BECKY LOU You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . BECKY LOU Right . ( BECKY exits . HOSS picks up the knives and stalks the dummy . He circles it and talks to the dummy and himself . As he talks he stabs the dummy with sudden violent lunges then backs away again . Blood pours from the dummy onto the floor. ) p. 30 HOSS O.K. Gypsy King , where 's your true heart . Let 's get down now . Let 's get down . You talk a good story . You got the true flash but where 's yer heart . That 's the whole secret . The heart of a Gypsy must be there ! ( He stabs at the heart of the dummy then backs off . ) Maybe not . Maybe yer colder than that . Maybe in the neck . Maybe it pumps from the neck down . Maybe there ! ( He stabs at the neck then backs off . Blood gushes out . ) All right . All right . A secret 's a secret . I can give you that much . But it comes from this end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me down to your experience . Go ahead . Make a move . Put me in a place . An inch is fatal . Just an inch . The wrong move 'll leave you murdered . Come on . Lemme see it . Where 's the action ? That 's not good enough for the back lot even . Here 's one ! ( He makes a quick move and stabs the dummy in the stomach . ) Now I get it . There ai n't no heart to a Gypsy . Just bone . Just blind raging courage . Well that wo n't do you , boy . That wo n't take you the full length . Yer up against a pro , kid . A true champion Marker . Yer outclassed before the bell rings . Now you 've stepped across the line , boy . No goin ' back . Dead on yet feet . ( to himself ) What am I gettin ' so wired about ? This kid is a punk . It ai n't even a contest . He 's still ridin ' in fifties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A fair head . Gang bangs , cheap wine and bonfires . I could take him in my sleep . I could . I could  --  ( BECKY enters with DOC . DOC has a large sheet of foil with mounds of cocaine on it . He sets it down on the chair. ) p. 31 BECKY LOU How 's it goin ' ? HOSS Something 's lacking . I ca n't seem to get it up like the other kills . My heart 's not in it . DOC Have some a ' this . ( He holds out a rolled up hundred dollar bill . HOSS takes it and goes to the coke . ) HOSS Yeah . Maybe that 'll help . ( He takes the bill and snorts the coke as he talks . ) You know , I been thinkin ' . What if the neutral field state failed . One time . Just once . BECKY LOU Like this time for instance ? HOSS Yeah . Like this time . BECKY LOU Then you 're a gonner . DOC It should n't fail , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but what if an emotional field came through stronger . BECKY LOU Like love or hate ? HOSS Not that gross , not that simple . Something subtle like the sound of his voice or a gesture or his timing . Something like that could throw me off . BECKY LOU You 're really worried about this Gypsy . HOSS Not worried . Intrigued . His style is copping my patterns . I can feel it already and he 's not even here yet . He 's got a presence . Maybe even star quality . His movements have an aura . Even his short . I mean nobody rides a ' 58 Impala to do battle with a star Marker . p. 32 BECKY LOU He 's just a fool . DOC You got ta stay disengaged , Hoss . The other way is fatal . HOSS Maybe not . Maybe there 's an opening . A ground wire . BECKY LOU For what . He 's come to Knock you over , man . HOSS O. K. but I can play in his key . Find his tuning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't have to off him soon 's he walks in the door . DOC You 'd be better off . He 's probably got eyes to work that on you . HOSS I do n't think so . He 's got more class than that . I can feel him coming . We might even be in the same stream . He 's got respect . BECKY LOU Respect ! He 's a killer , man . HOSS So am I. There 's another code in focus here . An outside code . Once I knew this cat in High School who was a Creole . His name was Moose . He was real light skinned and big , curly blond hair , blue eyes . He could pass easy as a jock . Good musician . Tough in football but kinda dumb . Dumb in that way  --  that people put you down for in High School . Dumb in class . He passed as white until his sister started hangin ' around with the black chicks . Then the white kids figured it out . He was black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nigger , a coon , a jungle bunny . A Rock Town boy from that day on . We ran together , Moose and me and another cat from Canada who dressed and wore his hair like Elvis . They put him down too because he was too smart . His name was Cruise and he got straight A 's without readin ' none a ' the books . Slept in a garage with his aunt . Built himself a cot right over an old Studebaker . His mother was killed by his father who drove skidders for a lumber company up near Vancouver . Got drunk and busted her in the head with a tire iron . The three of us had a brotherhood , a trust . Something unspoken . Then one day it came to the test . I was sorta ' ridin ' between ' em . I 'd shift my personality from one to the other but they dug me ' cause I 'd go crazy drunk all the time . We all went out to Bob 's Big Boy in Pasadena to cruise the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from our High School . Our own High School . There were eight of ' em , all crew cut and hot for blood . This was the old days ya ' know . So they started in on Cruise ' cause he was the skinniest . Smackin ' him around and pushin ' him into the car . We was right in the parking lot there . Moose told ' em to ease off but they kept it up . They were really out to choose Moose . He was their mark . They wanted him bad . Girls and dates started gathering around until we was right in the center of a huge crowd a ' kids . Then I saw it . This was a class war . These were rich white kids from Arcadia who got T-birds and deuce coups for Xmas from Mommy and Daddy . All them cardigan sweaters and chicks with ponytails and pedal pushers and bubble hairdo 's . Soon as I saw that I flipped out . I found my strength . I started kickin ' shit , man . Hard and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and holdin ' their balls . Moose and Cruise went right into action . It was like John Wayne , Robert Mitchum and Kirk Douglas all in one movie . Those chumps must a ' swung on us three times and that was all she wrote . We had all eight of ' em bleedin ' and cryin ' for Ma right there in the parking lot at Bob 's Big Boy . I 'll never forget that . The courage we had . The look in all them rich kids ' faces . The way they stepped aside just like they did for " Big John . " The three of us had a silent pride . We just walked strong , straight into that fuckin ' burger palace and ordered three cherry cokes with lemon and a order a ' fries . p. 33 DOC Those were the old days . HOSS Yeah . Look at me now . Impotent . Ca n't strike a kill unless the charts are right . Stuck in my image . Stuck in a mansion . Waiting . Waiting for a kid who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then . A young blood . And I got ta off him . I got ta roll him or he 'll roll me . We 're fightin ' ourselves . Just like turnin ' the blade on ourselves . Suicide , man . Maybe Little Willard was right . Blow your fuckin ' brains out . The whole thing 's a joke . Stick a gun in your fuckin ' mouth and pull the trigger . That 's what it 's all about . That 's what we 're doin ' . He 's my brother and I got ta kill him . He 's got ta kill me . Jimmy Dean was right . Drive the fuckin ' Spider till it stings ya ' to death . Crack up your soul ! Jackson Pollock ! Duane Allman ! Break it open ! Pull the trigger ! Trigger me ! Trigger you ! Drive it off the cliff ! It 's all an open highway . Long and clean and deadly beautiful . Deadly and lonesome as jukebox . DOC Come on , Becky , let 's leave him alone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Alone . That 's us . All fucking alone . All of us . So do n't go off in your private rooms with pity in mind . Your day is comin ' . The mark 'll come down to you one way or the other . BECKY LOU You better rest , Hoss . HOSS Ya ' know , you 'd be O.K. , Becky , if you had a self . So would I. Something to fall back on in a moment of doubt or terror or even surprise . Nothing ' surprises me no more . I 'm ready to take it all on . The whole shot . The big one . Look at the Doc . A slave . An educated slave . Look at me . A trained slave . We 're all so pathetic it 's downright pathetic . And confidence is just a hype to keep away the open-ended shakes . Ai n't that the truth , Doc ? p. 34 DOC I do n't know . HOSS Right . Right . " I do n't know " is exactly right . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rip your fuckin ' teeth out a ' yer heads ! ! GO ON BEAT IT ! ! ! ( BECKY and DOC exit . HOSS sits in his chair and stares out in front of him . He talks to himself , sometimes shifting voices from his own into an older man's. ) ( old ) All right , Hoss , this is me talkin ' . Yer old Dad . Yer old fishin ' buddy . We used to catch eels side by side down by the dump . The full moon lit up the stream and the junk . The rusty chrome flashin ' across the marsh . The fireflies dancin ' like a faraway city . They 'd swallow the hook all the way down . You remember that ? ( himself ) Yeah . Sure . ( old ) O.K. You 're not so bad off . It 's good to change . Good to feel your blood pump . ( himself ) But where to ? Where am I going ? ( old ) It do n't matter . The road 's what counts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where it 's goin ' . ( himself ) I feel so trapped . So fucking unsure . Everything 's mystery . I had it all in the palm of my hand . The gold , the silver . I knew . I was sure . How could it slip away like that ? ( old ) It 'll come back . ( himself ) But I 'm not a true Marker no more . Not really . They 're all countin ' on me . The bookies , the agents , the Keepers . I 'm a fucking industry . I even affect the stocks and bonds . ( old ) You 're just a man , Hoss . Just a man . ( himself ) Yeah , maybe you 're right . I 'm just a man . ( CHEYENNE enters ) p. 35 CHEYENNE Hoss . He 's here . ( HOSS stays seated , relaxed . He has an air of complete acceptance . ) HOSS Good . He 's here . That 's good . What 's his name ? CHEYENNE He calls himself Crow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you sound him on the duel ? CHEYENNE Yeah . He 's game . He looks tougher than I thought , Hoss . HOSS Tough . Tough ? ( he laughs ) Good . A tough Crow . CHEYENNE What 'll I tell him ? HOSS Tell him I like his style . Tell him I 'm very tired right now and I 'm gon na cop some z 's . He can take a swim , have a sauna and a massage , some drinks , watch a movie , have a girl , dope , whatever he wants . Tell him to relax . I 'll see him when I come to . CHEYENNE O.K. You all right , Hoss ? HOSS Yeah . Just tired . Just a little tired . CHEYENNE O.K. HOSS Thanks , man . CHEYENNE Sure . ( CHEYENNE exits . HOSS stays seated looking out. ) @x SCENE : The stage is the same . The lights come up on CROW . He looks just like Keith Richard . He wears high-heeled green rock and roll boots , tight greasy blue jeans , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shark tooth earring , a silver swastika hanging from his neck and a black eye-patch covering the left eye . He holds a short piece of silver chain in his hand and twirls it constantly , tossing it from hand to hand . He chews a stick of gum with violent chomps . He exudes violent arrogance and cruises the stage with true contempt . Sometimes he stops to examine the guns on the floor , or check out the knives and the dummy . Finally he winds up sitting in HOSS 'S chair . A pause as he chews gum at the audience . HOSS enters dressed the same as in Act One . CROW does n't move or behave any different than when he was alone . They just stare at each other for a while . HOSS My sleuth tells me you 're drivin ' a ' 58 Impala with a Vet underneath . CROW Razor , Leathers . Very razor . HOSS Did you rest up ? CROW Got the molar chomps . Eyes stitched . You can vision what 's sittin ' . Very razor to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far end of the spectrum . HOSS It was n't strategy man . I was really tired . You steal a lotta ' energy from a distance . p. 38 CROW No shrewd from this end either . We both bow to bigger fields . HOSS You wan na drink or somethin ' ? CROW ( he laughs with a cackle ) Lush in sun time got ta smell of lettuce or turn of the century . Sure Leathers , squeeze on the grape vine one time . HOSS White or red ? CROW Blood . HOSS Be right back . CROW No slaves in this crib ? HOSS They 're all in the pool watching a movie . CROW Very Greek . HOSS Yeah . Just relax , I 'll be right back . ( HOSS exits . CROW gets up and walks around thinking out loud ) CROW Very razor . Polished . A gleam to the movements . Weighs out in the eighties from first to third . Keen on the left side even though he 's born on the right . Maybe forced his hand to change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high range . Cut at the gait . Heel-toe action rhythms of New Orleans . Ca n't suss that particular . That 's well covered . Meshing patterns . Easy mistakes here . Suss the bounce . ( CROW tries to copy HOSS 'S walk . He goes back and forth across the stage practising different styles until he gets the exact one . It 's important that he gets inside the feeling of HOSS 'S walk and not just the outer form . ) Too heavy on the toe . Maybe work the shoulders down . Here 's a mode . Three-four cut time copped from Keith Moon . Early . Very early . Now . Where 's that pattern . Got ta be in the " Happy jack " album . Right around there . Triplets . Six-eight . Here it comes . Battery . Double bass talk . Fresh Cream influence . Where 's that ? Which track . Yeah . The old Skip James tunes . Question there . Right there . ( sings it ) " I " m so glad , I 'm so glad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm glad . " Yeah . Ancient . Inborn . Has to be a surgery . Grind down . ( He hears HOSS coming and darts back to the chair and sits as though he 'd never moved . HOSS enters with a bottle of red wine and two glasses . He hands one to CROW and then he pours himself one and sets the bottle down. ) p. 39 HOSS Ya know I had a feeling you were comin ' this way . A sense . I was onto a Gypsy pattern early yesterday . Even conjured going that way myself . CROW Cold , Leathers . Very icy . Back seat nights . Tuck and roll pillow time . You got fur on the skin in this trunk . HOSS Yeah , yeah . I 'm just gettin ' bored I guess . I want out . CROW I pattern a conflict to that line . The animal says no . The blood wo n't go the route . Re-do me right or wrong ? HOSS Right I guess . Ca n't you back the language up , man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CROW Choose an argot Leathers . Singles or LPs. 45 , 78 , 33 1/3 . HOSS I musta ' misfed my data somehow . I thought you were raw , unschoolded . Ya ' know ? I mean , maybe the training 's changed since my time . Look , I wan na just sound you for a while before we get down to the cut . O.K. ? You do n't know how lonely it 's been . I can talk to Cheyenne but we mostly reminisce on old kills . Ya ' know . I do n't get new information . I 'm starving for new food . Ya ' know ? That do n't mean I wo n't be game to mark you when the time comes . I do n't sleep standin ' up . Ya ' know what I mean ? it 's just that I wan na find out what 's going on . None of us knows . I 'm surrounded by boobs who 're still playin ' in the sixties . That 's where I figured you were . Earlier . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CROW That sand stayed on the beach with me . You can suss me in detail Leathers . What 's your key ? HOSS This is really weird , me learnin ' from you . I mean I ca n't believe myself admitting it . Ya ' know ? I thought I could teach you somethin ' . I thought you were playin ' to the inside . Choosin ' me off just to get in the door . I mean I know you must be Mojo 's trigger , right ? CROW De-rail Leathers. you 're smokin ' the track . HOSS Eyes traced a Nevada route . It do n't matter . If you ai n't from the Root Force you 're on the Killin ' floor Jack . Anyway you cut it you 're a corpse . So let 's lay that one on the rack for now . Let 's just suspend and stretch it out . CROW We can breathe thin or thick . The air is your genius . HOSS Good . Now , first I wan na find out how the Gypsy Killers feature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off . Are we playin ' to a packed house like the Keepers all say ? CROW ( he cackles ) Image shots are blown , man . No fuse to match the hole . Only power forces weigh the points in our match . HOSS You mean we 're just ignored ? Nobody 's payin ' attention ? CROW We catch debris beams from your set . We scope it to our action then send it back to garbage game . p. 41 HOSS Listen chump , a lotta ' cats take this game serious . There 's a lotta ' good Markers in this league . CROW You chose ears against tongue Leathers . Not me , I can switch to suit . You wan na patter on my screen for a while ? HOSS Sorry . It 's just hard to take . If it 's true . I do n't believe we could be that cut off . How did it happen ? We 're playing in a vacuum ? All these years . All the kills and no one 's watching ? CROW Watching takes a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . HOSS And now you hammer us with fucking indifference ! This is incredible . It 's just like I thought . The Outside is the Inside now . CROW ( he cackles ) Harrison , Beatle did that ancient . It cuts a thinner slice with us . Roles fall to birth blood . We 're star marked and playing inter-galactic modes . Some travel past earthbound and score on Venus , Neptune , Mars . HOSS How do you get to fucking Neptune in a ' 58 Impala ! CROW How did you get to earth in a Maserati ? HOSS There ! Why 'd you slip just then ? Why 'd you suddenly talk like a person ? You 're into a wider scope than I thought . You 're playin ' my time Gypsy but it ai n't gon na work . And get the fuck outa ' my chair ! ! ( CROW slides out of the chair and starts walking around , twirling his chain and chomping his gum . HOSS sits down . He sips his wine . Slowly through the dialogue CROW starts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it perfect. ) p. 42 CROW Your tappets are knockin ' rock-man . I sense an internal smokin ' at the seams . HOSS Yeah , so this is how you play the game . A style match . I 'm beginning to suss the mode . Very deadly but no show . Time is still down to the mark , kid . How 's your feel for shivs anyway ? CROW Breakdown lane . Side a ' the road days . HOSS Yeah , well that 's the way it 's gon na be . I ai n't used a blade myself for over ten years . I reckon it 's even longer for you . Maybe never . ( HOSS begins to switch into a kind of Cowboy-Western image . ) I reckon you ai n't never even seen a knife . A pup like you . Up in Utah we 'd use yer kind fer skunk bait and throw away the skunk . CROW Throwin ' to snake-eyes now Leathers . HOSS So you gambled your measly grub stake for a showdown with the champ . Ai n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say it again . Pathetic . ( CROW is getting nervous . He feels he 's losing the match . He tries to force himself into the walk . He chews more desperately and twirls the chain faster . ) You young guns comin ' up outa ' prairie stock and readin ' dime novels over breakfast . Drippin ' hot chocolate down yer zipper . Pathetic . CROW Time warps do n't shift the purpose , just the style . You 're clickin ' door handles now . There 'll be more paint on your side than mine . p. 43 HOSS We 'd drag you through the street fer a nickel . Naw . Would n't even waste the horse . Just break yer legs and leave ya ' fer dog meat . CROW That 's about all you 'll get outa ' second . Better shift it now Leathers . ( HOSS shifts to 1920s gangster style . ) HOSS You mugs expect to horn in on our district and not have to pay da ' price ? Da ' bosses do n't sell out dat cheap to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ punk or you 'll wind up just like Mugsy . ( CROW begins to feel more confident now that he 's got HOSS to switch . ) CROW Good undertow . A riptide invisible moon shot . Very nice slide Leathers . ( HOSS goes back to his own style . ) HOSS Do n't give me that . I had you hurtin ' . You were down on one knee Crow Bait . I saw you shakin ' . CROW Fuel injected . Sometimes the skin deceives . Shows a power ripple . Misconstrued Leathers . ( CROW is into HOSS 'S walk now and does it perfect . ) HOSS You were fish tailin ' all over the track meathead ! I had you tagged ! CROW Posi-traction rear end . No pit stops the whole route . Maybe you got a warp in your mirror . p. 44 HOSS There 's no fuckin ' warp . You were down ! CROW Sounds like a bad condenser . Points and plugs . HOSS Suck ass ! I had you clean ! And stop walkin ' like that ! That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way I walk ! ( CROW stops still . They stare at each other for a second . HOSS rises slow . ) All right . I can handle this action but we need a Ref . I ai n't playin ' unless we score . CROW It 's your turf . HOSS Yeah , and it 's stayin ' that way . I 'm gon na beat you Gypsy . I 'm gon na whip you so bad you 'll wish we had done the shivs . And then I 'm gon na send you back with a mark on your forehead . Just a mark that wo n't never heal . CROW You 're crossin ' wires now Leathers . My send is to lay you cold . I 'll play flat out to the myth but the blood runs when the time comes . HOSS We 'll see . You 're well padded Crow Bait but the layers 'll peel like a skinned buck . I 'm goin ' to get a Ref now . You best use the time to work out . You ai n't got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharpening up . When I get back it 's head to head till one 's dead . ( HOSS exits . The band starts the music to CROW 'S song .

He draws a big " H " on the top left side of the board and a big " C " on the other . He separates the letters with a line down the middle . As he goes about his business HOSS talks to CROW. ) p. 46 HOSS I suppose you would n't know what 's happened to my people ? Becky . Cheyenne , Doc , Star-Man  --  they 're all gone . So 's my short . CROW Lotsa ' force concentration in this spot Leathers . Could be they got bumped out to another sphere . They 'll be back when the furnace cools . HOSS I do n't fancy tap dancers Crow Bait .
