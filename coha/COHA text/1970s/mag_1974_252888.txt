" We are easy to scout but tough to play against . " That is John Wooden 's way of saying that U.C.L.A. 'S court tactics are textbook-simple on paper yet devastatingly effective on the court . " With Bill Walton in our lineup , our strategy is simple , " Wooden explains . " You go to him until the opposing team stops it . Then you go to others . If you do n't go to Walton , it 's like using Babe Ruth in your lineup to bunt . " <P> The Wooden approach is , of course , more sophisticated than that ; the Bruins always play within a well-rehearsed plan . On offense , Wooden 's first love is the fast break , with Walton firing lead passes to his teammates streaking down the court to score before the opposition 's defense can set up . <P> For more patterned play , Wooden deploys four men near the basket-three forwards and the center-leaving only one guard to bring the ball up court and start the play . In this " low-post " system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ball to Walton , positioned on the left side of the court close to the basket . If Walton is well covered , Curtis tries to hit Keith Wilkes , roving near the foul line . As a last resort , he can also pass to Marques Johnson or Dave Meyers , who play up front on opposite sides of Walton . <P> A spread-out offense like that-in theory-discourages defenders from peeling off the player they are covering to double-team Walton . The moment that happens , a U.C.L.A. player is left wide open . Another play designed to produce an open man stacks Meyers and Wilkes together to the right of the basket . This bunches the defense , setting up a " breakout " for Wilkes or Meyers , who can spring down the foul lane and take a pass from Curtis or Walton to score on a layup . Other favorite U.C.L.A. plays bring Walton out to a " high-post " position ( near the foul line ) , opening up the middle for passes to Wilkes , Meyers or Johnson . <P> When opponents first get the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2-2-1 zone press-harassing the man with the ball all the way to midcourt . <P> Continually working hard merely to get the ball down the court fatigues many poorly conditioned teams . Once the ball is across midcourt , U.C.L.A. falls into man-to-man defense , sagging off players to converge on the man with the ball . With Walton to clog up the middle and intimidate anyone considering a layup , this defense forces play to the outside , where most college shooters are least effective . <P> After three years of playing together , the Walton gang is a little set in its ways . In one recent game , the Bruins simply ignored Wooden 's instructions to start using a full-court press . " They listen but do n't hear , " says the coach . Wooden has another , more unlikely problem . " I tell my kids to play as if Walton was n't playing , " he laments , " but I think subconsciously they have the attitude ' Bill will do it . ' " Other coaches dream about having troubles like that .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
