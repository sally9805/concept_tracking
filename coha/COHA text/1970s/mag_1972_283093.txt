A brief case of jitters shook some of the Stardust out of the stock market last week but failed to halt the long upswing of the past four months . The main cause of concern : a rise in short-term interest rates , which signaled an apparent mild switch in the Federal Reserve Board 's easy-money policy . Now , to stem the flow of dollars abroad , the board has decided to let short-term rates edge up . <P> Though a rate rise had been anticipated , the news moved many investors to sell . On the first day of trading last week , the Dow Jones industrial average plunged eleven points , to 929 . But the Dow picked up in subsequent sessions and closed the week at 943 . A major stabilizing factor : the belief that the Federal Reserve will not revert to a restrictive money policy and risk stalling the business recovery in a presidential election year . Most Wall Street professionals are optimistic and are all but certain that the Dow will pierce the magical 1,000 level before long . <P> Dawdling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dow Jones average of 30 big , old industrial stocks suggests . The Dow is the market 's best-watched barometer , but it is lagging well behind more representative , broader-based gauges . Standard &; Poor 's index of 425 industrial stocks hit a new all-time high four weeks ago . Last month the industrial component of the New York Stock Exchange 's 1,047-issue index also reached a record . Yet the Dow dawdles 52 points behind its record closing of 995 posted in February 1966 . <P> Dogging the Dow 's progress are the limp performances of quite a few of its stocks , including Anaconda , United Aircraft , U.S. Steel and International Harvester . Profits of many of the big firms have been vitiated by recession , expropriation of their property abroad and muscular foreign competition . Because their size makes them so visible and the impact of their actions is so widespread , the prices that large firms charge are more tightly controlled than those of smaller companies . <P> Buoyant Profits . There is good reason for optimism . The economy , though not booming , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is much too high , and retail sales remain flaccid ; the personal-savings rate for January touched a phenomenal 9.2% , up .5% from the month before . On the other hand , home building continues robust , running at a record annual rate of 2,500,000 starts in January . <P> Factory orders are up , and inventories are at last slowly rising . Most significant , in what could be the start of a more rapid economic climb , industrial production jumped a sharp .7% in February , bringing the total increase in the past three months to a sturdy 1.8%.
