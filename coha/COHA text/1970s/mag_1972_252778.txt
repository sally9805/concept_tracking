High among the time-honored privileges of campaign fund-raisers is the chance to bask in the reflected glory of a successful candidate . Even so , on the night of George McGovern 's nomination in Miami Beach , his national finance chairman , Henry Kimelman , seemed to be doing much more than mere basking . With his arm wrapped around McGovern 's wife Eleanor , Kimelman flashed enough winning smiles and V signs at the TV cameras to have been the candidate himself . Gary Grant , with whom the darkly handsome Kimelman has occasionally been compared , might call the scene one in which a supporting actor makes his move toward stardom . Indeed , Kimelman 's real-life business career has abounded with successful reaches for top billing . <P> Brooklyn-bred Kimelman , 51 , is chairman of the West Indies Corp. , the biggest ( annual sales : $18 million ) import house in the Virgin Islands , his adopted home of more than two decades . As the islands ' commissioner of commerce from 1961 to 1964 , Kimelman was one of several businessmen who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sun into a tourist mecca . Since the islands are one of the two American free ports outside the U.S. ( the other : Guam ) , the business of importing duty-free liquor , perfume and other goodies for tourists has grown fast . Kimelman 's fortune is estimated to be $10 million . <P> The son of a textile importer , Kimelman got into the liquor business through his father-in-law , who owned a rum distillery in Puerto Rico . Kimelman moved to St. Thomas after investing in the islands ' earliest first-class resort hotel , the Virgin Isle , which he later leased on hugely favorable terms to Hilton . Kimelman and his brother-in-law acquired the distributorships of a number of name-brand liquors , including Cherry Heering , Grand Marnier and J &; B Scotch . When the Johnson Administration tried to ease the nation 's balance of payments deficit by chopping , from a gallon to a quart , the nontaxable liquor allowance for Americans returning from abroad , Kimelman helped lead the successful fight to keep the one-gallon rule in the Virgin Islands . That greatly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> One Word . Not without egotism , Kimelman says , " I enjoy achievement . " His unceasing drive soured many personal relationships , including those with his brother-in-law , who dropped out of the business , and with former Governor Ralph M. Paiewonsky , who accepted his resignation from the commerce commission . But Kimelman caught the SAMMA fancy of Stewart Udall , then the Interior Secretary , who hired him as his aide . In Washington , Kimelman became friends with McGovern , whom he admired for his antiwar stand . McGovern and his supporters have been frequent guests at the Kimelman home overlooking the Charlotte Amalie harbor . ( Campaign Managers Frank Mankiewicz and Gary Hart rested up from the Democratic Convention there . ) <P> A group was celebrating McGovern 's 47th birthday at the Kimelman home in 1969 when they got word of Teddy Kennedy 's Chappaquiddick accident . <P> As Kimelman tells it , he immediately urged McGovern to run for the ' 72 nomination and promised : <P> " I 'll make it possible .
