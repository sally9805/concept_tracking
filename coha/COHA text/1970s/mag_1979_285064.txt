A former P.O. W. runs the Naval War College and teaches too <P> The lecturer is all Navy : blue uniform , gold braid , seven rows of ribbons , a lined , leathery face and a full mane of white hair . Like a captain on his bridge , he paces back and forth before his students , 45 mature , mid-career military officers taking a year of graduate studies at the Naval War College in Newport , R.I. <P> The lecturer , Vice Admiral James Stockdale , 55 , is accustomed to speaking before sizable groups of men . As a wing commander aboard an aircraft carrier , he had to brief his pilots before every mission . But now he is talking about moral dilemmas , not military targets . Stockdale is not only president of the 94-year-old Naval War College but also a philosophy teacher who designed his course , " Foundations of Moral Obligation , " to combat what he calls " the deadening of moral sensitivities . " <P> Jim Stockdale brings to his classroom a unique set of credentials : a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 130th in the class of 1947 , behind Jimmy Carter , who was 60th , and CIA Director Stansfield Turner , who was 25th ) ; a master 's in international relations from Stanford ; and a doctorate in heroism from 7 years as the senior American P.O.W. at Hoa Lo prison , the infamous Hanoi Hilton . <P> In 1977 Stockdale was named president of the Naval War College , which sits on a wind swept point overlooking Narragansett Bay . Among his first acts was to draft Joseph Brennan , 68 , professor emeritus of philosophy at Columbia University , to help him design and teach a course on military morality . " The twists and turns of the fortunes of war have a way of throwing operational skippers and others out into new decision-making territory where all previous bets are off , " says Stockdale . <P> Every Wednesday Stockdale and Brennan team for a two-hour lecture ; on Thursdays the class joins the discussion in a 90-min. seminar . " This is n't a leadership course , " says Stockdale . " It 's a walk through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students contemplate man as moral animal . The reading list is long and demanding : Socrates , Aristotle , Kant , Mill , Sartre , Emerson , Dostoyevsky , Marx and Lenin . Frequently the class dwells on the unfair ness of fate as illustrated by Job in the Bible , by Camus in The Plague , by Solzhenitsyn in One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich . And by James Stockdale as a sorely tested P.O.W. <P> Stockdale came to philosophy as a 38-year-old Navy fighter pilot enrolled in a master 's program at Stan ford 's Hoover Institution . <P> Part of his reading was this passage from the Enchiridion , a manual for Roman field soldiers by the philosopher Epictetus : " It is better to die in hunger , exempt from guilt and fear , than to live in affluence and perturbation . " It was a lesson Stockdale would draw on repeatedly after parachuting from his crippled A-4 jet and landing in North Viet Nam on Sept. 9,1965.                  @ @ @
