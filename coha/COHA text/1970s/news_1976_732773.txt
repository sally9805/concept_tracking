txt THE BOYS were home alone last Thursday night with Freckles , the family dog . Their mother , Mrs. Zena Girdvainis , a graphics designer , was due any minute from her night class . And it was she they were expecting when the buzzer rang . So , Sigi and yenya , 10-year-old twins , pressed the security buzzer to let their mother in . But it was not their mother who walked into the hallway at 5455 N. Kenmore Av . It was two Chicago policemen . But Siginand - Vanya and Freckles the dog did n't know . The boys banged open the door of their second-floor apartment to run down and greet their mother . Freckles headed the pack  --  down and around the stairs she went , barking as she always does when Mrs. Girdvainis comes home . THE BOYS were coming down behind her when they heard a voice . It was a man 's voice and it yelled , " Hold your dog . " " Come on Freckles , " collet Vanya , " come en Freck . . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly Freckles was n't barking anymore . She whimpered weakly and then was still . The boys still could n't see , but they knew Freckles had been shot  --  by a robber ? Or a burglar ? Or someone who 'd get them next ? Terrified , they ran back up the stairs , slammed the door , and bolted the locks . Frightened , they dialed 911 to get the police . But nobody answered . And they were afraid whoever was down in that hall with that gun would be coming up to get them soon . SO IN THEIR stocking feet they HMI out into the cold  --  out the back door and onto the porch , huddling together behind an unhinged door , waiting for the danger to go away . It seemed like a long wait until they dared venture back in . And when they did , the landlady called to tell them to come downstairs . The police were there , she said , and someone had shot their dog . The boys first called a neighbor who came over to be with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay Freckles , dead  --  and blood all over the floor . Standing over her were two policemen . One of thorn said he was sorry about the dog . Sigi stood paralyzed , unable to reply . But Vanya could . " Get out of here , I hate you , " he yelled . And then the neighbor took the two boys away . A HALF AN HOUR later , Mrs. Girdvainis got home . She thought it was curious that her landlady was cleaning up something that looked like blood . And sho she asked what had happened . She was told that some policemen " shot your dog . They came and took the dog away already , and your boys are across the street . " " I brought the boys back home , " says their mother . " I brought them up the back way so they would not have to see the bloodstains . I made it to the kitchen , and then I started to cry . The boys broke down , and we sat there with our arms around each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I got Freckles from the Humane Society , and I got her as a friend for the boys and for protection for my house . But she never . was vicious with anyone  --  not even with some burglars who broke in once and helped themselves . " ALL SHE ever did was wag her tall and bark . She always barked and jumped around in circles like a ballerina , trying to lick your hand . She vas just a family dog , and the boys loved her . " So I ca n't understand why she was shot  --  right here inside the building . Right In front of the boys . You do n't just go into someone 's building , ring their buzzer , and once you 're in , fire a gun at someone 's dog . What if they hit my boys ? And how did they think the boys would feel when they killed her right before their eyes ? " Later that night , one of the policemen came back . I was in my nightgown when I answered my door , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doorway and said he wanted to explain . He said they were called to the area because a woman was reported screaming , and when they could n't find her , they thought they 'd check our building. ? So they rang our buzzer , and my boys buzzed them in . " THIS WAS N'T the policeman who shot the dog , but he said he was sorry , lie said it was his partner who did it and he did n't have the nerve to come back . " I said I was sorry too  --  that they . ever came into our building . And that two little boys innocently buzzed them in and right like that , they killed Freckles . " I know their car number . It 's 2016 , And I told this policeman that they were cowards  --  two big men against Freckles and two 10-year-old boys , and the first thing they do is use their gun . They could have waited for the boys to get down and grab Freckles , or they could have gone back out the door if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have kicked at her or used their billy clubs . But Instead , one of them . panicked and pulled a gun and shot her dead . " And if that one cop who shot her dead would have just come back to talk to the kids and explain how he felt and said he was sorry  --  but he sent his partner instead . He did n't have the courage . When I asked why did it happen , that policeman gave me an explanation . He said , ' We never know what to expect when we go into a building . ' And I guess he 's right . Because neither does the public . "
