txt Letters to the Editor pg . 38 Letters to the Editor The Case for a Massive Energy Program To the Editor : The solution to our national dilemma of recession , inflation and runaway energy cost lies in a bold new approach which attacks all three problems simultaneously . Specifically , the U.S. Energy Research and Development Administration should be enlarged tenfold to create a massive energy program , directed along the lines of the RASA space program , and organized to recapture costs through ultimate license royalties . An energy research and development program budgeted at $30 billion to $40 billion per year would provide a major stimulus to the economy . This stimulus would not be inflationary since the Government expenditures for research , development and pilot production would represent an investment on which the Government could subsequently collect royalties and thus recent ) its expenditures . Private industry would participate in the research , development and pilot production under NASA-like supervision . The massive energy program expenditures would put several million people to work directly and millions more indirectly through stimulation of the general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , welfare and other nonproductive ( and hence inflationary ) expenditures , but we would rebuild the people 's confidence in their ability to support themselves through meanTo the Editor . Dr. Smyth 's Feb. 28 Op-Ed article was quite provocative but is not really a new idea . Industry has been looking at the use of alchohols for fueling internal combustion engines for a long time . Aside from a.few technical problems , which no doubt can be handled , the basic problem has always been the economics . Historically , gasoline usually left the refinery at ten to twelve cents per gallon on a tax-free basis while alcohols were in the twenty-cent range . Furthermore , the heat content on a gallonage basis is much less for alcohol , thus requiring as much as one-third to one-half more alcohol to get the same mileage as with gasoline . Today , of course , with the sharp increases in crude prices , ' the cost of gasoline has increased on a tax-free basis to at least twenty cents . Because of the change in economic parameters there again is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves . Ethyl alcohol is usually made from grain , and what . with the world food shortage , it is improbable that we ? would use up foodstuffs to make fuels for our automobiles . Some work is now going on to make alcohol from cellulose . Methyl alcohol can also be used but , in the quantities needed , coal seems to be the only raw material available for methanol manufacture . If The Crime Antidote To the Editor : Holdup man " Nick , " whose story was reported in the March 5 Times , said it very succinctly when asked what would deter men like him : " Stiffer sentences . " For years penologists , psychologists and other self-styled experts have told us that long sentences have ? little deterrent value . Now a real expert tells us that they are wrong . Stiff sentences , and stiff sentences only , can help diminish the intolerably burdensome rate of crime . " Stiff sentences " means ten years for burglary , twenty years for pursesnatching , life for assault ( mugging ) , death for rape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with plea-bargaining outlawed and with judges having clear mandates to go by , crime would soon shrink to a fraction of what it is now . But do our legislators have the will power and the courage to pass the necessary laws ? Theirs alone is the responsibility for our intolerable state of affairs ; they alone can rescue us from virtually certain destruction of our society . JERRY G. BECHHOFER New York , March 5 , 1975 ? Our . Spendthrift Universities To the Editor : Scarcely a week passes that my mail does not include a legitimate appeal for financial assistance to an educational institution . In view of this , it seems ironic that some of the same universities are offering the likes of John Dean and Ronald Ziegler honorariums of up to $3,000 to address the student body . I strongly support the First Amendment , but I submit that a scrutiny of the financial priorities of these uniwe are to use coal anyway , it certainly seems to make sense to use it directly for generating power . We believe that very shortly it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ environment . W. KaEss East Coast Public Affairs Representative , Shell Oil Company New York , March 6 , 1975 ? Spanish Refugees To the Editor : I am glad to see that you have printed so much recently about Spain as well ? as memories of the Lincoln Brigade . But I have seen no mention of the 50,000 or more refugees of the Spanish Civil War who are still in exile , most of them in France . Many of them have passed through Franco 's prisons and have been fortunate to survive tortures and long years of misery . And the rest have endured 36 years away ? fnam their country after losing their homes and their families . I , They need to be remembered ' too and shown that we understand and care for the sacrifices they made for us all when they tried to fight back fascism . NANCY MACDONALD , Director , Spanish Refugee Aid , Inc . New York , Feb. 25 , 1975 versities is in order when they misapply funds of such magnitude . In my judgment , it is obscene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result of their proximity to and participation in the most sordid chapter in our political history . HARRY M. Zurz , M.D. Millburn , N. J. , March 2 , 1975 ? Urban Renewal To the Editor : For those who feel that this city suffers terribly from neglect , I offer this bit of news : A peeling , faded , barely legible sign at the Manhattan entrance to the Queensborough Bridge has not been forgotten . It has been replaced by a clearly and boldly lets tered new one which advises : " Horse Drawn , Vehicles Prohibited Between the Hours of 7-10 A.M. and 4-7:30 P.M. " DARRILYN DESSER Beechhurst , N. Y. , Feb. 27 , 1975 ? On Color-Blind Reporting To the Editor : Does n't Ernest Dunbar , in " Racism and Reporting " ( Op-Ed Feb. 25 ) , prove the validity of the very thing he complains about ? By properly stating , " I was the only black in that class , " he tells us his identity and establishes his point of view . Why should n't an individual 's color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand him ? If I commit a crime , and publication of the fact that I am white helps the authorities to capture me , should I instead have been shielded by insistence on color anonymity ? Are we now expected to . see no distinction between a Chinese and a Hindu ? And what ever happened to " black is beautiful " ? DONALD M. BROWN New Rochelle , N. Y. , Feb. 28 , 1975 On Pakistan 's Arms Need To the Editor . I was disappointed to read the negative attitude expressed toward the resumption of U.S. arms supplies to Pakistan in your Feb. 26 editorial titled " Arms Supplier . " It is ironical that on Page 11 , of the same issue of The Times a news story reports that a Soviet defense team headed by Marshal Grechko is in New . Delhi . It continues , " Moscow has al. - ready supplied MIG aircraft , subma-. rines , tanks and other defense equipment . It also has been collaborating in the manufacture of aircraft and military equipment . " Thus , on what basis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pakistan will give rise to an arms race in the Subcontinent ? India is far ahead of Pakistan to the extent that she has entered the " nuclear club . " Pakistan , on the other hand , hasneither the resources nor the intention to build the bomb or try to catch up to Indian military strength . All Pakistan needs is a sense of security and the ability to defend herself from ' hostile neigbors. is that asking tcid. much ? Pakistan does not have an arms industry to fulfill her requirements and has requested her ally , the . U.S. , to sell her defensive weapons : The editorial reminds me , of an .. analogy which claims that Cuba should not buy any more weapons or it will give rise to an arms race between her : - and the United States . ZAHID MAHMOOD New York , Feb. 26 , 1975 ? Of Kissinger 's Critics And Questions of Taste To the Editor : Lawrence Eagleburger , executive as , - : sistant to the Secretary of - State , rebuts criticism of Mr. Kissinger in. your ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the manner and tone of the . late Senator : . Joseph McCarthy ; that the criticism : is " unfair , offensive , distasteful and . painful " and not in " good taste " ; ; , that the criticism impugns Mr. Kissinger 's motivation Op-Ed March 5 . The issue on which . Mr. Kissinger was criticized by Anthony Lewis and , others is , of , course , the endless war . in Southeast Asia and the endless American participation in it , now ing revived by the Administration . To be sure , good manners and tons are always in order , and " painful " : criticism is better avoided if adulatory suggestion will suffice . But I suggest , that Mr. Eagleburger 's approach is a. remarkable reversal and perversion of reality . What is painful is the cost of the war to America , to the peoples of Southeast Asia , to the victims of " carpet bombing " mutilation . What ought to be painful to the average American who may or may not be able to empathize with far-off people 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from one Administration and another , including the present one . The issue is not the " good taste " of Mr. Lewis ' criticism . The issue is whether carpet bombing , death , mu- ' tilation , endless war and the destruc-. tion of the moral fabric and , economy of America are in good taste ; it is these things which Mr. Kissinger is trying to renew in Cambodia and , Vietnam . In these perversions of value , ' Mr. Eagleburger , apparently no critic ' of the Southeast Asian holocaust , ought to understand , or his readers ought to understand , on whose side ' truth and preservation of life and morality , let alone historical justification , lie . ROBIN W. BRIEHL , M.D. New York , March 6 , 1975 ? Restore Aid to Turkey To the Editor : Of course military aid to Turkey , which was cut off on Feb. 5 , must . be reinstated if we have any intention to maintain NATO as a bulwark against Communist aggression . Had Secretary of State Kissinger sent the American Sixth Fleet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Turkey would have taken another method to protect the Turkish colony on Cyprus from the threatenedassault of Nikos Sampson . No Turkish fleet would have challenged the Sixth Fleet . We are consistently missing the ball , as in Cambodia , South Vietnam , South Korea and Chile . Why must we be so naive as to bow to corruption and dictatorship ? Each time we lose by an ill-advised misstep , the United States becomes the whipping boy for the unaffected nations , and the tattered ' rags of our reputation are flaunted before the peoples under one-party rule such as Russia and China . Democracy is proving to be a weak reed on which to lean . Where did wrong ? go LINDA CARLON RUN we Bloomfield , N. J. , March 3 , 1975 ingful work . The R. &D.; program should be aimed at providing commercially viable . systems , equipment and techniques for the utilization of basic energy sources in appropriate applications  --  atomic fusion , solar energy , gasification of coal , tidal energy , wind energy . The energy program should also address itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building design , in efficient masstransportation systems , in electric vehicles of practical design . In the short run a massive energy research and development program could restore the health of our economy without danger of inflationary stimulation . In the long run the program would provide independence from foreign oil suppliers , would effectively lower energy costs and would ? permit export of new energy-related equipment to the rest of the world . This in turn would help the Free World to become independent of foreign oil suppliers while vastly improving the U.S. balance of trade . Further , , the new energy systems , equipment and techniques can be traded to the Third . World for its raw materials , thus raising its standard of living and reducing the possibility of ultimate ' confrontation between the " haves " . and the " have-nots . " EDWIN F.
