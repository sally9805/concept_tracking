The weigh-in , conducted in a spirit of rancor and confusion , wound up in a dispute reminiscent of the Dempsey-Tunney long count at Chicago way back in 1927 . Bob Foster , a deputy sheriff from Albuquerque who was recognized by the World Boxing Council as light-heavyweight champion of the world , came in to the Miami Beach Convention Hall weighing 175 pounds , precisely the upper limit of the division . Vicente Rondon , a Venezuelan recognized as light-heavyweight champion by the World Boxing Association , weighed 177 , which made him a heavyweight by any definition except that of the Miami Beach Boxing Commission , which studiously ignored the scales though they had been tested and approved by the Dade County weights and measures department . Charlie Bookbinder of the commission clearly announced Ron-don 's weight as 177 , and then for some reason laughed . Others laughed later when he denied that he had said it . In any event , the commission ruled that the fighters weighed a neat 175 pounds each , by fiat if not by the scales , and with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavyweights do n't see very often , nobody was about to argue . Leastwise , not Lou Viscusi , Foster 's manager , who said , " Their guy is over the limit . We ca n't lose the light-heavy title . " // It was all academic . Foster knocked out Rondon in 2 minutes 55 seconds of the second round and is now beyond question the light-heavyweight champion in everyone 's eyes and is being widely hailed as the hardest puncher the division has known . It might even be true . Rondon was down and out far longer than the 10 seconds counted over him by Referee Cy Gottfried . Perhaps for as long as two minutes he lay face down on the canvas , his heels twitching , causing considerable alarm . It was announced later that he could not attend a press conference because he had suffered a concussion . All knockouts are concussions . Rondon had suffered an embarrassment . // When the fighters came into the ring before 6,131 fans  --  some of whom had even paid the $50 top for ringside seats  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gold trunks , was apprehensive . His sensitive features could not conceal fear . The only disgrace was that while almost all intelligent boxers feel fear , they usually manage to hide it . // During the first round , Rondon stayed away from Foster , hunting shelter along the ropes and in the corners , and if the object was to make the bout a race rather than a fight , he was successful . Foster 's jabs , among the best ever seen , were falling short . Approaching the Venezuelan in that sideways , crablike , left-leading style that makes him so hard to hit  --  only his left flank is exposed  --  Foster let almost two minutes go by before he landed even moderately solid blows . Then his punches began to take effect . There were two quick jabs to the belly and chest , a right and a hook to the head , another right and left to the jaw and a right to the belly . All these punches scored solidly . Just before the bell ended the round , Rondon landed his one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was not enough to impress anyone , to say nothing of Foster . // Between rounds Rondon 's corner exhorted him to make a fight of it , an inside fight , his most effective style , and to his credit Rondon did his best to follow orders . He walked into two jabs but then , to the delight of his fellow Latin Americans , he actually scored with a right to the head and he followed that with a jab . In return , Rondon took a few punches , but they appeared to sting him into what up to then was the best action of the fight . // Rondon got inside Foster 's long left and proceeded to tangle at close quarters , safe country . There was a furious flurry of punches from both men , but in the end it was Rondon who broke off , discovering the country was n't all that safe . Seconds later , Rondon went down from a left and right to the head that , in fairness , might have been aided by a slip . Before a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bleeding slightly . Foster next landed a couple of good jabs , but then both stood , as two in wonder . Suddenly Foster threw a combination that consisted of a powerful right and two hooks . The right really did it . Rondon was on his way to the canvas when the other blows caught him . That is when he began to twitch. // The lanky Foster  --  he stands a slender 6 ' 3 ? " and looks as if he had the punching power of a healthy girl  --  moved quickly away from his fallen foe as Gottfried began the count . The now undisputed champion 's face was creased with a grin so broad that it distorted his Fu Manchu mustache . At the instant the count was completed , Rondon 's seconds rushed to his aid but were cautioned not to get him up until he had regained full consciousness . // It had been a true grudge fight all the way , by no means faked for promotion purposes . Foster was consumed with hatred for the World Boxing Association because it stripped him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miami Beach commission , an aggregation of restaurateurs and car salesmen , because of its inept , self-serving handling of the weigh-in . And he had not the least love for Rondon. // Through an interpreter , Rondon had said before the fight that he was not impressed by reports of Foster 's punching power . " I like to get hit hard , " he said naively . " It wakes me up and makes me fight harder . " This time it made him sleep better . // In training , Rondon had looked to be a more worthy opponent than , in retrospect , he was . Two inches shorter than Foster , he was strong and showed he could be particularly damaging on the inside with his uppercut . No light heavyweight ever had beaten him . Since the WBA awarded him Foster 's championship on the strength of a victory over swift Jimmy Dupree , Rondon had defended his version of the title four times . // Neither had Foster ever been defeated by a light heavyweight . The fight that did him in with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heavyweight championship four months later . Frazier knocked Foster out in the second round , and the WBA said sternly that Foster should have been fighting light heavyweights . Maybe so , except a man would like to make a little money out of his championship , and nowhere was there a light heavyweight with the drawing power of Joe Frazier. // Thus it was that Foster entered this fateful match  --  it was promoted as THE SHOWDOWN  --  with a heart that rankled against injustice . And when victory finally came , it did not soothe the vengeful Foster . He paid none of the customary graceful tributes to his opponent 's courage and skill . // " He was scared to death , " the now indubitable champion declared at the postmortem . " And he 's dumb . I 'd just as soon it had gone the full 15 rounds so I could have punished him . " Not very sporting , but understandable under the circumstances . // It was only the weigh-in that made the fight memorable . Rondon had spent the two previous days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he came to the scales he was obviously unhappy about something . Weight ? He got on the scales . Bookbinder made his call , and his gaffe . But pragmatists make the calls in this sport . Although it was clear that Rondon was dehydrated and could not lose another pound , he was going to make the weight if it took the weight of the commission to insure it . // When the fighters came into the ring that night their weights were brazenly announced as 175 . Manager Viscusi had said bravely and philosophically , " If they want me to fight heavyweights , I will fight heavyweights . We 're still champions , no matter what . We 'll fight , and we 'll have the title , regardless . " // In an aside , Viscusi disclosed that on his own personal scales , Foster had weighed less than 175 pounds a half hour before the weigh-in . " He weighed 174 and a heavy half , " the manager said . " It was a little more than 174 ? and not quite three-quarters . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so far as everyone connected with the fight was concerned . It was also the end of Rondon 's brief reign .
