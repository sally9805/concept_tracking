THE SAILOR WHO FELL FROM GRACE WITH THE SEA <P> Directed and Written by <P> LEWIS JOHN CARLINO <P> This unsavory brew of landlocked lechery and homicide has something - although not enough-to do with a Yukio Mishima novel . The book 's spiritual narcissism and level tone of nightmare has been replaced here by the flossy look of soft-core porn , the pulpy dementia of a horror flick . <P> Jonathan ( Jonathan Kahn ) lives in an English village near the sea with his widowed mother , Anne ( Sarah Miles ) . When he is not watching her undress through a knothole in his bedroom wall , he spends his time with a group of boys whose leader , known as the Chief ( Earl Rhodes ) , is intent on molding his playmates into a fine bunch of kinky cryptofascists . <P> Jonathan 's mother starts a perfervid affair with an American seaman , Jim ( Kris Kristofferson ) , which her son also observes intently through his knothole . Jonathan liked Jim when they first met , thought him strong , worldly and commanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sailor may have been fine on the ocean , where he was part of " the pure and perfect order of things , " but away from his rightful place , he becomes an imperfect creature , a subject of jealousy and contempt who must be done away with . Jonathan consults the Chief , who had previously persuaded his minions to dispatch the family cat . The Chief sees no reason why the boys should not broaden their murderous horizons . <P> These rotten little kids are meant to carry the freight of the novel 's frenzied bully-boy philosophy . In this hapless screen translation by Lewis John Carlino ( a scenarist making his directorial debut ) , they just come off looking like second-class citizens of The Village of the Damned . Fortunately , it is impossible to take the movie seriously on any level . A film maker who uses pounding pistons and dripping hoses for phallic symbols is a threat only to himself .
