txt Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger said today that he was confident that no American president would ever allow the Soviet Union to gain strategic superiority over the United States and that the concept of " supremacy " made no sense in the nuclear age . While not disagreeing with Mr. Kissing . er . Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld told a New York audience today that the Pentagon was concerned that " the trends of the past 10 to 15 years have been decidedly adverse " to the United States . He said that the United States " must act now and in the future to reverse these adverse trends by providing real increases for national security . " Page 6 . The views of the Ford Administration 's top national security officials  --  both in their last 10 days in office  --  underscored the different approaches taken by the State and Defense Departments to intelligence reports of increases in Soviet military spending and superiority over the United States in some military areas . Mr. Rumsfeld places greater emphasis on the reports and has regularly warned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the current parity in the military balance could be upset . Mr. Kissinger , however , has argued that such reports are misleading because in // the atomic age neither side would be able to have a genuine superiority in the nuclear field . The nuclear arsenal of ballistic missiles and long-range bombers makes it impossible for either side to " win " a war . Mr. Kissinger believes . American energies , he contends , should be devoted to further accords to limit strategic arms , while stepping up spending on conventional and tactical forces for regional conflicts . Cyrus R. Vance , who will succeed Mr. Kissinger next week , told reporters after a closed door session with the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that he believed that a " general parity " exists between the Soviet Union and United States although he conceded he had not been exhaustively briefed on the subject . Addressing an overflow audience at the National Press Club in what was probably his last public appearance here , Mr. Kissinger said that " the American people must understand that strategic nuclear weapons confront all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first time in history , mankind can literally destroy itself . " " I do not believe that the Soviet Union is achieving military supremacy over the United States , " he said in a question-andanswer session after his largely philosophical speech . " I do not believe that any American administration would permit a situation to arise in which the Soviet Union could achieve strategic superiority over the United States . " " But the essence of the contemporary problem in the military field is that the term ' supremacy , ' when casualties will be in the tens of millions , has practically no operational significance , " he said , " as long as we do what is necessary to maintain a balance . " Mr. Kissinger repeated his view that the main military concern of the United States was not in the strategic field  --  the intercontinental ballistic missiles , heavy bombers , and submarine-launched missiles  --  but in conventional and tactical nuclear forces such as those in Europe . He said those forces " must be modernized and strengthened : " In recent weeks there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; ntelligenc. estimates about Soviet canabilities and intentions . that the Russians were seeking military domination over the United States . Mr. Kissinger regards these reports , particularly some of the statements , made by military officials . as aimed at sabotaging efforts at achieving a new treaty limiting stategic arms . " I think it is time that we conduct a rational debate on the issue of nuclear strategy , " he said , repeating a constant theme of his over : the last two years . " It is too important and vital a subject to be made a subject of partisan and doctrinaire political debate . " He said those who talk about achieving supremacy in the strategic field " are not doing this country a service and not doing mankind a service . " It was a typical Kissinger performance , with a mixture of seriousness and levity . The National Press Club set a bizarre note by unveiling a belly dancer minutes before Mr. Kissinger was to speak , and having her perform her gyrations , in obvious imitation of Egyptian dancers who entertained during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Teacher Today 's performer was a Virginia kindergarten teacher who apprears as " Shadia " in a local night club . Mr. Kissinger , who until today had resisted requests to reflect on his eight years in government  --  since September 1973 as Secretary  --  allowed himself some sentimental moments . " Three and a half years ago , I , an immigrant and naturalized citizen , was sworn in as Secretary of State of my adopted country , the greatest nation on earth , " he said . " The responsibilities once borne by styli men as Jefferson , Madison , Monroe . Marshall , and Acheson were temporarily bequeathed to me . " In no other country in the world would it have been possible . Igcause of my origin , I have perhaps had a unique perspective of what America means to the cause of freedom and human dignity . And I have had no hi-her aim than to repay in some small measure my debt to this country which save ! me from totalitarianism and the world from slavery . " Addressing the audience , many of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said : " I leave to you , for a time , the great domain of public policy . I would be hypocritical if I pretended that to part is easy . I envy you the excitement , the responsibility , the opportunities to contribute , that will : be yours . I shall never forget how hard you tested me . I shall always cherish the e : : periences we enjoyed together . And I will think of you with affec:Ion tinged with exasperation . " The main thrust of Mr. Kissinger 's speech was on the need for nonpartisanship in foreign policy . In answer to questions , Mr. Kissinger declined to say what his greatest achievement and his greatest failures were ? quipping that he was " hard of hearing " on the second category . But he did say that his worst disappointment was " the distintegration of executive authority " that resulted from the Watergate scandal He said this prevented the United States " from exploiting fully " the international situation .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
