On its way to a December rendezvous with Jupiter , the unmanned spacecraft Pioneer 10 last week finished the 210-day leg of its journey that took it through the asteroid belt . Pioneer . which was launched in March 1972 , thus became the first vehicle from earth to pass safely through the vast ring of rocky debris that circles the sun between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter . The relatively uneventful , 200 million-mile passage removed a major concern of both science-fiction writers and scientists : that spacecraft in the asteroid belt would be damaged and perhaps destroyed by flying rocks . <P> Scientists from NASA 'S Ames Research Center reported that the 570-lb. , saucer-shaped ship was hit no more than once a day even in the most dense part of the belt , which consists mostly of tiny particles , rather than the chunky rocks that peril science-fiction space travelers . None of the impacts were made by fragments larger than a grain of sand , and none did any detectable damage to the thinly shielded $50 million craft . By carefully planning Pioneer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miles from those larger ( at least seven miles in diameter ) and rarer asteroids that can be seen by telescope on earth . Said NASA 's newly confident Dr. William Kinard : " We 're firmly convinced that the asteroid belt presents little hazard for future spacecraft going to explore the outer planets .
