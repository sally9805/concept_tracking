We Need a ' New To the Editor : The time has come when people should begin thinking seriously about the problem of inflation and begin to realize what it already has done to us , where we now stand and where we are heading . Corrective measures should no longer be delayed . The fundamental fact that must be recognized is that we and all other nations of the world are now , always have been and always will be on the gold standard . It is a natural law which neither the Congress nor any other legislative ' body or executive decree can change any more than they can change the law of gravity . All they can change is the value of their own currencies in relation to gold . The value of gold it the constant by which other values are measured . It is the value of the dollar which fluctuates in relation to gold . In 1929 the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of gold ; today it is 1/121 of an ounce , ' and as inflation continues it depreciates day by day . It ' depreciated In accordance with Gresham 's Law ( bad money drives out good ) until gold coins were worth More as bullion than as currency . People hoarded them , and they disappeared from circulation . ( I am fully aware of the governmental - effort to force people to turn in their gold coins . Those who turned them in were the dupes ; those who did not were astute . On Jan. ' 3 , 1974 , Double Eagles ( $20 gold pieces ) were ' selling at $214.65 each . ) The dollar continued to depreciate until it no longer was worth the silver contained in its silver coins ( dimes , quarters and half-dollars ) . People Dollar ' . hoarded them , they disappeared from circulation , and they . were replaced by the current copper-clad coins . The depreciation . now has reached the point where the cent no longer is worth the value of thee copper in . the one-cent coin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rapid rate , and the Government is planning to make them of aluminum or something cheaper . Aa depreciation continues , the copper-clad ! Jinja , quarters and half dollars will follow the same route and be replaced with aluminum or ' paper . The sooner we get back ' on a sound currency , the better .. To do this , we must legalize the private ownership Orgold bullion , reform the currency by realistically revaluing the dollar in terms of gold and resume the free coinage of gold coins .. Right now it might be done by issuing one " new dollar " for each five or six now in circulation . The longer we delay , the higher will be the ratio at which redemption must be made . The French issued a new currency a few years ago at a ratio of one " new franc " for 100 of the old ; Germany in 1923 issued one " new mark " for one billion of the old . Someone long ago observed that those who refuse to learn the lessons of history are doomed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until it is worth as much as or more than the metallic content of the coins now withdrawn from circulation , such of them is have not already been melted down and used for other purposes will come out of hiding and back into use again . STANTON Lilo DAVIS Cleveland , Jan , 4 , 1974 Arab Superpower : The Greater Threat To the Editor : The Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries ( O.A.P.E.C. ) , ' having successfully deployed the oil weapon ; must now contemplate what . to ' do with this annual ' windfall of some ' fifty To become a financial superpower without having strong military forces or strong allies is to court disaster in a hostile world bristling with superpowers . But O.A.P.E.C. must use the fifty billions in a , constructive manner or risk pushing the West into an economic tailspin with serious remcussions to O.A.P.E.C. These two ' situations become reconcilable when O.A.P.E.C. decides to invest $25 billion ( a superpower budget ) in purchasing advanced arms , thus keeping Western industry going in high gear . Note the recent French deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receive advanced armaments in return . Financially besieged , the Western countries will compete vigorously to sell O.A.P.E.C. advanced arms and advanced technology . Indeed , for a mere billion dollars , could n't the ' Arab countries purchase a uranium diffusion plant and , with technicians importable from the West or from China , develop their own nuclear deterrent against the gunboat diplomacy they may have to face ? Unless we of the West and the Soviets act immediately to force the Arab countries to back down from their course of economic piracy we invite a new decline of the . West as the new superpower Arabs dominate the world . economic picture . In five years they can become so secure militarily that they can have the Soviets remove their self-serving protection , as Sadat did in 1972 . ' And would not the memory of feudal Saracen glory inspire the nationalistic/religious fervor of Arabs ( for centuries frustrated . by the ' power and success of Western civilization ) and unite the Arab monarchs and revolutionaries in a new Jihad for power ? The Kremlin 's dream of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . by a Chinese-Arab alliance of overwhelming financial strength , technology and men because the sympathetic Maoists already have the nuclear technology and conventional-arms training , pilots and technicians . This danger outweighs the Soviet ideological gains from an economic collapse of the West . If the foregoing scenario seems extravagant , it also has a sense of inevitability . Will our planners promptly use the d  --  tente with the Soviets to sponsor a dialogue on countermeasures ? The indicated actions are to ' demand a rollback of posted oil prices to $3.01 and to embargo O.A.P.E.C. from advanced arms and nuclear technology however economically attractive that may now appear to the West . We will continue to believe , at our peril , in the myths of the Arabs ' disunity , backwardness and peace-loving enlightenment . Their frustration , cunning and economic opportunism will test our wills severely . H. L. FRUCHTER Narberth , Pa. , Dec. 28 , 1973 ? Forgotten Prisoners To the . Editor : It is good to know that The Times considers conditions of politial prisoners in the Soviet Union sufficiently important to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fortunate to have Solzhenitsyn as eloquent spokes-. man . Conceivably , outside pressure can change the situation , as we hope it might in . Chile , Brain , Greece and other countries with which the . United States Government currently has cordial relations and whose police and military it helps train and equip . In South Vietnam , however , similar conditions exist for political prisoners in prisons which U.S. taxpayers help build , equip and maintain . Why is n't the plight of these political prisoners , over which we presumably have more direct control , also on your front pages ? Though they have no Solzhenitsyn ( that we know about ) , the South Vietnamese of those prisons have many heartrending stories to tell , the information is available , and our outrage can have direct political effect . ANN MORRISSETT DAVIDON Haverford , Pa. , Dec. 29 , 1973 ? A Eulogy to ' Rise and Shine ' To the Editor : It 's true that " time " as we know it is a man-made contrivance superimposed on our daily lives and that people have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rituals . ( The summer practice of daylight saving has proven this . ) Yet think of the upset the newly established " saving " system has effected in our often-forgotten body clocks or in the nervous systems of mothers of urban school-age children . How cosmic for the edict to arrive on the Day of Epiphany . Only raw do we realize how essential is awakening to a refreshing new day of sun : shine and hope  --  instead of the prevailing gloom . FRANCES SWAN Levy New York , Jan. 10 , 1974 The . Unfair Subsidy To the Editor : Congress should immediately eliminate the oil depletion allowance . The profits , of ? he oil companies are at an all-time high , so they will never be in a better position to start paying their fair share of taxes , thereby relieving the burden on other taxpayers . Also , the incentive offered by the oil depletion subsidy is all wrong in our present energy crunch . By using tax money to help support the consumption as well as the production of petroleum , we do little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .. R does little good for American self-sufficiency for the American taxpayer to subsidize the construction of refineries abroad or to subsidize foreign exploration . Most voters feel that with the recent increases , in gas and oil prices they are already contributing enough profits ? to motivate the oil companies without being asked to pay taxes to subsidize them further . ? However , to the extent that ' our energy needs ' call for intensified domestic petroleum exploration beyond the level which would occur anyway in response to private profit motivation ; the Congress might want to initiate . a new subsidy specifically for domestic oil exploration . Any new subsidy should be designed carefully to reward the desired activity without constituting a new tax loophole by means of which wealthy investors can shelter their income from fair taxation . CHARLES C. HOLT ' Bethesda , Md. , Jan. 14 , 1974 ? The Magic Sentence To ' the Editor : Richard Eder 's Jan. 11 news article , " Behind . the Bravado , Deep British Doubt , " included one sentence which seems to me ( British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be quite worthy of Jane Austen or E. M. Forster : " On the south coast , where retired majors live in bungalows , British flags are appearing . " How better than that could one capture ' at once so many of the vital qualities of Britain today  --  the sense of historical decline , the near-dead nostalgia for Empire , the sadness , even quiet desperation , and yet also the understated ironical humor and a determination to win through the present crisis ? DAVID J. R. OGILVIE Brooklyn , Jan. 14 , 1974 Physician 's Right To the Editor : The announcement concerning President Nixon 's proposal for a national health-insurance program which embodies , among other items , provisions for the regulation of doctors ' fees news story Jan. 9 brings to the , fore a question inherent in many proposals relating to national health insurance currently before Congress : Is it not a violation of our Constitution ( Articles V and XIV ) for Congress to pass a law attempting to fix or regulate , on a permanent basis , the fees or wages of any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? a utility company . They do not constitute a trust or cartel . Nor is there any evidence that they adhere to a countywide , statewide or nationwide fee structure of a monolithic nature . As pointed out in your article , " Recent disclosures by the Social Security Administration have shown enormous variations in the fees doctors charge for performing identical services .... " So patients have a genuine choice . The fact that systems of health care exist in Quebec Province , England , Sweden , France and other socialized countries wherein doctors ' fees are . closely regulated is of zero significance since no other country in the world has a constitution that safeguards the rights of individuals against government oppression in the fashion that ours does . And although the case for the doctors ' fees is obviously not , a , . popular one , even the most dedicated doctor-haters would have to , concede that the rights of a physician under the United States Constitution are not diminished one iota by virtue of the nature of his occupation . As the debate over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has ' proceeded during the past several years , it has always seemed germane to me that such a system could either not exist in our country because of its violation of the constitutional rights of individual American citizens or could only be , established if significant portions of the Constitution were forever ignored . Our system ( or nonsystem ) of medical care has evolved as part of a system of free enterprise in an open society . Perhaps the time has come in our , social evolution when we can no longer afford to let doctors be free to price their services in the open market . If such be the case , all citizens have a stake in. the resolution of this issue inasmuch as the treatment accorded physicians by Congress , if unchallenged , could then be meted out to any group . Physicians ' prosperity merits no ground , swell of public sympathy , but constitutional rights are everybody 's business . JOHN J. MCGARRY , M.D. Darien , Conn. , Jan. 10 , 1974            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
