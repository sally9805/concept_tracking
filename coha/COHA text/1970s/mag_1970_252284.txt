Zombie " If the dead were to come back , what would you do with them ? " <P> #151 ; Alfred Hitchcock <P> You would call them Topaz . It would seem difficult to make a zombie from Leon Uris ' tense bestseller , based on diplomatic crescendos leading up to the Cuban missile crisis . Yet Alfred Hitchcock has done so without any discernible effort , spiritlessly following the events to their evitable inconclusion . <P> A French spy , Andre Devereaux ( Frederick Stafford ) , is employed by American intelligence to venture into Cuba . He emerges with evidence of Russian rockets , but in the process abets the deaths of cooperative peasants , patriots and his old inamorata ( Karin Dor ) . Kiss-of-death Devereaux returns to Paris with another revelation : Topaz is the code name for quislings in the De Gaulle Cabinet . They too are rooted out , to perish ignominiously . <P> Almost all of Hitchcock 's films deal with moral dilemmas . In Topaz he attempts to demonstrate that in international politics one can not move his arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national action there is an equal and opposite reaction . <P> The master has made such points in films from Foreign Correspondent to Torn Curtain . But at 70 , Hitchcock seems suddenly to have forgotten his own recipe . Topaz contains no chills , no fever-and most disappointing , no entertainment . By the finale , the predictability of every turn and the grossness of the heroes and villains recall the old gag about the espionage agent who whispered a code message to a locked door . " Wrong apartment , " came the reply . " I 'm Ginsberg the tailor . You want Ginsberg the spy , upstairs . "
