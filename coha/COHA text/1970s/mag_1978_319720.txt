The most distressing thing about last week 's news that consumer prices swelled at a 7.4% annual rate in February was that Washington 's policymakers were relieved . They had expected the rise to be worse . Indeed , many of them take high inflation for granted , which is the first step toward giving up the fight . They forget too easily that not too long ago 3% inflation was considered to be steep , 4% dangerous , 5% intolerable . Now experts chorus that the U.S. has an " underlying " inflation rate of at least 6%-intractable , indomitable , unassailable . <P> In fact , the inflation rate can-and must-be brought down . There is no mystery about what causes inflation : too many demands by too many people upon a limited amount of national wealth . The cure is more difficult to prescribe , but surely it involves discipline , limits , sacrifice . The means to retard inflation are economically feasible , but they are thought to be politically impractical . We know many of the ways ; all we lack is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year , since any attack on inflation would hit at the privileges of specific interest groups , who threaten their fearsome counterattacks at the polls . But perhaps some politicians would be brave enough , and wise enough , to advocate steps that would earn the outrage of specific interests in the short run but gain the support of the inflation-strained majority over the longer haul . Among the steps that , taken together , could cut inflation : <P> Reduce the Budget . President Carter emptily claims that his budget for the next fiscal year is " tight , " although it has soared since 1974 from less than $270 billion to more than $500 billion , and the planned deficit will run an inflationary $60 billion-plus for the second straight year . With the economy rising and unemployment falling , even Treasury Secretary W. Michael Blumenthal and the rest of Carter 's closest economic advisers believe that the deficit should be contained . Wisconsin Democrat William Proxmire , one of the Senate 's best economic thinkers , argues that the budget should be shrunk to $465 billion . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billion by selective paring . If spending is brought down , the Government will be able to further cut personal and corporate taxes , which would offer the double benefit of strapping inflation and stimulating the economy . For invigorating the economy , lower taxes are more effective than higher Government spending . <P> Curb Regulation . The spreading powers of the Environmental Protection Agency , the Occupational Safety and Health Administration , the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and hundreds of other regulatory agencies aggravate inflation by adding to the budget and , more important , swelling the costs of doing business . One significant step would be to hold down the EPA 's " enforcement " spending , which is budgeted to jump from $73 million to almost $95 million . Every dollar devoted to EPA " enforcement " obliges U.S. business to invest many more dollars on nonproductive machinery , which then raises prices , reduces productive capital spending and retards hiring . <P> Restrain Social Security Benefits . They are scheduled to rise fast in the years ahead . By trimming the benefits , the nation can also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
