txt Each man writes " III " after his name , which some newspapers spell " 3rd " ? L. Patrick Gray III and John W. Dean III . Mr. Gray III , of course , is acting director of the FBI , up for confirmation by the Senate as permanent director . Mr. Dean III , of course , is President Nixon 's White House counsel . Their roles are curiously intertwined in the mounting confrontation between an aggressive President and an increasingly restive Congress . Their contact point is Watergate . Mr. Gray has testified that Mr. Dean sat in at hearings where ' the FBI made its investigation of Watergate , and received confidential files . Since the White House itself is alleged to have been involved in the Watergate affair , which involves political espionage and sabotage , the Gray-Dean relationship arouses interest . Now Mr. Dean has received a polite invitation from a ' unanimous ( yes , unanimous ) Senate Judiciary Committee to drop by sometime and testify on Mr. Gray 's confirmation . The invitation says " RSVP . " Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senate committee but will answer detailed relevant questions in writing that have a bearing on Mr. Gray 's nomination . Invitation declined In a letter to committee chairman James 0 . Eastland ( D ) of Mississippi , Mr. Dean said , " I must respectfully decline the invitation of the committee to formally appear and testify " consistent with the President 's recent statement on executive privilege . " I think it is essential to the nomination of Gray for Dean to appear , " Seri Sam J. Ervin Jr . ( D ) of North Carolina said . Senate Democratic whip Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia , who has opposed the nomi ? nation from the beginning , said : " If Dean does not show , the Senate ought not act to confirm Gray . It is vital to the integrity of the Senate , in its role of advice and consent , that it have full details before it acts . " // *Gray &; Dean in vortex // However , nothing is as simple as a mere invitation in Washington anymore , nor will it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circle each other , looking for openings . One day before the invitation to Mr. Dean , President Nixon laid down rules on " executive privilege " that seem to bar not only Mr. Dean 's appearance , but also appear to extend White House power in a process that has already frightened and confused Congress . A situation may well be shaping up in which the Senate wo n't confirm Mr. Gray if it does n't get Mr. Dean . However , the Dean-Gray affair is only a small and perhaps transient part of the much bigger contest that is slowly developing here , pushed by power and personality conflicts . " I believe in the battle , " Mr. Nixon told Saul Pett of the Associated Press in a recent interview , " whether it 's the battle of a campaign or the battle of this office , which is a continuing battle. ? It 's always there wherever you go . I perhaps carry it more than others because that 's my way . " Militancy is spread Mr. Nixon 's zestful militancy washes off on assistants . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John D. Ehrlichman , Assistant to the President for Domestic Affairs , on the TV program " Issues and Answers " has attacked House Speaker Carl Albert ( D ) of Oklahoma for " a doctrinaire Democrat position " allegedly favoring higher taxes . He spoke of Democratic Sens . George McGovern of North Dakota , Harold E. Hughes of Iowa , and Hubert H. Humphrey of Wisconsin as " characteristically big spenders " and derided Sen. Edmund S. Muskie ( D ) of Maine as " arm-waving " and " table-pounding . " Mr. Ehrlichman also attacked Sen. John V. Tunney ( D ) of California , leader in the Gray hearings . ? " The same kind of John Tunney politics is being played , " Mr. Ehrlichman said , " as he played in the ITT case ( an antitrust dispute involving International Telephone &; Telegraph and Hartford Fire Insurance , in which the largest merger in corporate history was AP photo Dean : invited to ' RSVP ' allowed ) . Senator Tunney is going to be repudiated by the Senate in the same way he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ normal political honeymoon after an election never occurred . Instead , there is a gathering series of congressional probes of Mr. Nixon 's extended power . ? There is the Gray affair . ? There is the bill to extend aid to the elderly , passed by the Senate , 82-9 , in one form , and in the House , March 13 , by 329-69 in another . The White House says it will veto the measure . The possibility of overriding the veto seems strong . Then comes the big question : Will Mr. Nixon impound ( not use ) funds ? ? Eleven other measures cleared the last Congress and were pocket-vetoed by Mr. Nixon last October , and some or all of them will reach the White House again , They may make the battieaf the two ' III 's " look like small potatoes .
