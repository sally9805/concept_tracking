PABLO PICASSO is nearly as old as the electric light bulb . He was nearing his quarter-century by the time the Wright brothers lumbered into the air at Kitty Hawk . He was well known by the start of World War I and a celebrity when it ended . Since then , his reputation has increased exponentially , to the point where the shape of 20th century art is unimaginable without him . This week Picasso turned 90 , and his birthday summoned a procession of tribute bearers . The Louvre has turned over its Grande Galerie to a selection of Picasso 's work , the first time in its history that this honor has been extended to a living artist . Said President Georges Pompidou , opening the show : " This is not a Picasso exhibition ; this is an homage from France to the great artist who has chosen our country to live and work in . " In New York , the offerings range from a loan show sampling the past 70 years of his work , shared between the Marlborough and Saidenberg galleries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1964 , containing a few dozen mildly erotic but trivial scribbles , published by Harry N. Abrams , Inc. at $500 a copy . Across the world , paeans rise to assure everyone that Picasso is younger and more exuberantly creative than ever , that he is still the supreme culture-hero of our century . <P> " We feel that no hand has ever possessed a greater gift of wonder , of revealing in one single , decisive stroke the mystery of life in all its profundity , " writes a critic named Jos Bergamin in one of the new books , Picasso at 90 . " The most perfect , absolute , authentic Picasso , the Picasso par excellence , it seems to me , is the latest one . " <P> The Legend . Such bombast is familiar because Picasso has not been a subject of serious controversy for at least 35 years . The man has become a monument , rising from a reflecting pool of undiluted praise . For Picasso is not merely the most famous artist alive . He is the most famous artist that ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard the names , let alone saw the work , of Michelangelo , Rembrandt or Cezanne while they were alive . His audience is incalculable . By now , it must run into hundreds of millions-including , admittedly , the many people who have heard of him but have no idea of his pictures . The old man with the monkey face and the black , insatiable eyes squats at the center of this reputation , proclaimed and hidden by its coils : the archetypal Minotaur in his maze . <P> Occasionally he prances out , wearing a funny hat . What he is validates what he does : he has so long been saddled ( not unwillingly ) with the task of being the vitality-image or phallus of the West that every sketch , painting or dish tends to be greeted with the same ritually stupefied reverence . Hence la lgende Picasso , which has been energetically prodded along by writers like Hlne Parmelin and photographers like David Douglas Duncan and Gjon Mili . From their breathless accounts a satyr rises , mythic , Gargantuan , and fatally easy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppose , begins with a light breakfast of goat 's testicles and salade nioise . Then , surrounded by a flock of admiring tame doves , he descends to his studio and executes 30 engravings , two murals and a still life . At lunch , having done a zapateado before the avid lenses of a team from Paris Match , he gives Dominguin some
