EUBIE ! <P> Music by Eubie Blake <P> The opening-night curtain call at Eubie ! would certainly have astonished the patrons of Miss Aggie 's bawdyhouse in Baltimore , where James Hubert Blake played ragtime piano at the turn of the century . Thin as a blade , remarkably spry and mentally trigger-quick , Eubie confounds his 95 years . At Broadway 's Ambassador Theater he mounted the stage , accepted a single rose in tribute , engaged in amiable banter and joined cast and audience alike as they roared out their affection by paraphrasing his biggest hit : " I 'm just wild about Eubie . " <P> Had the score been published when it was originally composed , people might first have gone wild about Eubie in 1899 when he wrote Charleston Rag . In that selfsame year Scott Joplin turned out Maple Leaf Rag . Eubie had an unlikely background for a composer . The son of ex-slaves , he had dropped out of school at 15 . He was the only one of eleven children to live to maturity . Ragtime was regarded as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in the house . Initially , Eubie toured the vaudeville circuit with Singer Noble Sissle . In 1921 , with Sissle as lyricist , the pair scored a national breakthrough with Shuffle Along , the first Broadway musical ever to be produced , directed , composed and performed solely by blacks . <P> Through an interesting process of historical change , Eubie ! probably owes its existence to the current vogue for all-black musicals . Ironically , where a Shuffle Along , a Blackbirds of 1930 or a Chocolate Dandies ( two other shows for which Eubie wrote the music ) were intended for all-white audiences , the current production courts black playgoers . As a measure of heightened self-esteem and possibly amused self-parody , blacks are now willing to admit that they can be superb singers and dancers - something that was regarded as a condescending racial stereotype in the ' 60s . <P> They are certainly singing and dancing with gut-lusty abandon in Eubie ! If the twelve members of the cast were sent to Washington , they could undoubtedly resolve the energy crisis in two hours . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cohesive theme , Eubie ! ranks as a mini-clone of Ain ' t Misbehavin ' . That is not too difficult to understand , since Fats Waller 's musical imagination was richer than Blake 's in wit , satire and sophistication . Eubie ! is thoroughly entertaining and unerringly professional , but it bubbles more often than it blazes . <P> The magnetic high spots of the show are provided by the brothers Gregory and Maurice Hines , whose feet are tap-dancing marvels of percussive precision . <P> Lonnie McNeill brings an urbane elegance and a honeyed tongue to In Honeysuckle Time . Sex becomes a four-letter word when musky-voiced Lynnie Godfrey smolders through such numbers as Daddy and I 'm Craving for That Kind of Love . Looking like an iridescent flapper from the ' 20s , Ethel Beatty makes Memories of You a heartbreak blues . Just about the entire cast puts sizzling bawdy English into If You 've Never Been Vamped by a Brownskin , You 've Never Been Vamped at All . Miss Aggie apparently taught Eubie more than he could ever forget . <P> <P> - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
