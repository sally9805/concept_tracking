The U.S. Senate is President Nixon 's domestic Cambodia , providing privileged sanctuary to an aggressive band of tormentors . But the Senate 's border is vulnerable every two years on election day , and looking to Nov. 3 Nixon is fashioning an attack unmatched by modern Presidents . <P> If his assault succeeds , he will change the view he now sees when he looks east from the White House to the Capitol : a Senate that is too liberal for his taste and his plans . It has handed him two humiliating defeats on Supreme Court nominations , challenged his prerogatives in Cambodia and permitted him a one-vote victory on the anti-ballistic missile issue . <P> Personal Line-Up . Nixon 's aim is to engineer a Republican takeover of the Senate , now 57-43 Democratic . Although history is against him , since the President 's party almost always loses seats in off-year elections , few Presidents facing an opposition Congress have had a better opportunity . Of the 35 seats up for election , 25 are now held by Democrats , and Nixon needs a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To achieve his goal , he has personally put together a line-up of nine candidates , eight of them House Republicans , to run for the Senate . The President 's men and their prospects : <P> &gt; Tennessee 's William Brock III , 39 , heir to a candy fortune , is favored to defeat incumbent Albert Gore , one of Nixon 's leading critics on the Viet Nam War . Brock faces an August primary but is expected to have no trouble . <P> &gt; Texas ' George Bush , 46 , son of former Connecticut Senator Prescott Bush , is an even bet to defeat Lloyd Bentsen for the seat that Liberal Ralph Yarborough lost in the Democratic primary in May . <P> &gt; Minnesota 's Clark MacGregor , 48 , an able , articulate campaigner , faces a long uphill battle to thwart Hubert Humphrey 's return to the Senate . They are competing for the seat Eugene McCarthy abandoned . Both have minor primary opposition . <P> &gt; Utah 's Laurence Burton , 43 , who first came to Congress as a legislative assistant , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wold , 53 , long a party stalwart , may get enough help from a third-party peace candidate to unseat Gale McGee , the Democratic incumbent who is generally a liberal but a consistent supporter of the war . Wold faces insignificant primary opposition . <P> &gt; Delaware 's William V. Roth Jr. , 49 , once head of the state 's G.O.P. organization , is regarded as certain to defeat state legislator Jacob Zimmerman for the seat being vacated by Republican John J. Williams . <P> &gt; North Dakota 's Thomas S. Kleppe , 51 , who lost a Senate race in 1964 , is trailing Incumbent Quentin Burdick . <P> &gt; Florida 's William Cramer , 47 , who in 1954 became the first Republican House member from his state since the Reconstruction , is now in a tough primary battle with George Harrold Carswell , Nixon 's rejected Supreme Court nominee . The winner 's Democratic opponent will be chosen in a September primary . The election is for the seat of retiring Democrat Spessard Holland . <P> &gt; Nevada 's William Raggio , 43 , Washoe county @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Raggio , who also faces a lightly regarded primary opponent , is the only one of Nixon 's starting nine who is not now a House member .
