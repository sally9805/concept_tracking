The correspondent for Novosti wondered about the possible injurious impact on Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau 's re-election bid next month . President Harold Ballard of the Toronto Maple Leafs termed it " a national disaster . " Dick Beddoes of the Toronto Globe and Mail , who had boastfully predicted a clean Canadian sweep , ate his column-after coating the newsprint with a thick layer of borsch . <P> The " disaster " occurred on the ice of the Montreal Forum , where the Soviet Union 's national hockey team trounced Team Canada-35 All-Stars of the National Hockey League-by a thumping score of 7-3 in the first of an eight-game series . What was more , the Russians beat Team Canada at their own game with what were supposed to be Soviet weaknesses : tough individual play and tenacious goaltending . Chastened by defeat , the N.H.L. stars roared back two nights later in Toronto to whip the Russians 4-1 . Yet in the third game in Winnipeg , it took a last-seconds save by Goalie Tony Esposito of the Chicago Black Hawks to preserve a 4-4 tie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prepared at week 's end for the fourth game in Vancouver , B.C. , and the remainder of the series on Russia 's home ice .

Eight straight . " Actually , the Canadians had every reason to be confident . Hockey is Canada 's national game , and even impartial experts figured that Russia 's subsidized " amateurs , " who dominate the International Ice Hockey Federation , would be no match for the superstar professionals of the N.H.L. In fact , when Canada pulled out of the federation two years ago in protest over the barring of its professional players , it issued a standing challenge to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Playing on foreign ice , the Soviets showed that they were individually better conditioned and collectively better coordinated than their slick , freewheeling Canadian counterparts . Their intricate , puck-control game often confounded N.H.L. defense men ; flashy Forward Valeri Kharlamov , who scored three goals in the first three contests , may be as good as the N.H.L. 's best . Whatever the outcome of the series , Russia has established itself as a hockey superpower , a worthy match for the men whose forebears invented the modern game .
