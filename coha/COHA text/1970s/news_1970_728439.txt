txt Secretary of Defense Melvin R. Laird said today that President Nixon would not send ground troops to fight in Laos without the consent of Congress . Mr. Laird gave this assurance to Congressmen following charges yesterday by . half a dozen Senators that the will of Congress had been subverted by American military action On the Plaine des Jarres in Laos . Congressional sources said today that the criticism had been triggered by fear that escalation of the fighting in Laos between Royal Laotian Government forces and the Communistled Pathet Lao and North Vietnamese troops would lead to the intervention of American ground forces . They pointed to the use of B-52 bombers against North Vietnamese troops on the plain and to North Vietnamese warnings that they would take steps if the attacks continued . Nixon 's Stand Reiterated Mr. Laird , after briefing , the House Appropriations Committee this morning , told newsmen : " The President has made it very clear that should any decision be made , or a recommendation on his part be made , as far as the use of American military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Congress of the United States for such approval . " Asked whether the Administration had something under consideration that might require Congressional action , Mr. Laird replied : " No , not at this time . " High Administration officials generally described the situation in Laos as worrisome , but not to a degree that warranted a greater intervention by American forces . There was some disagreement about how far North Vietnamese troops would carry their offensive , but senior officials doubted that they would advance beyond previously held . positions . Rogers Reassures Thanat In a related matter , Secretary of State William P. Rogers has reassured Foreign Minister Thanat Khoman of Thailand that the Nixon Administration intended to fulfill United States commitments to Thailand even though those pledges have been criticized in Congress . Authoritative sources In the Thai Embassy here said today , that Secretary Rogers had been " emphatic " in giving those as ? surances to Mr. Thanat when he called on Mr. Rogers at the State Department last evening . American officials cautioned , however , that the United States could not give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that would require the United States to come to the defense of Thailand with whatever military , economic and diplomatic support that might be needed . The American commitment to Thailand arises from the two countries ' common membership in the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization . The SEATO pact requires members to meet an armed attack in accordance with their constitutional processes . In 1962 , Dean Rusk , then Secretary of State , and Mr. Thanat said in a communiqu ? that the United States obligation to Thailand did not depend on agreement with other parties , such as Britain or Pakistan , also SEATO members , but was a commitment the United States undertook by itself . Since then , the bilateral alliance has expanded by the dispatch of American air forces to Thailand , where they are based for operations in South Vietnam . Economic and military aid has added an intangible com-mitment Mr. Thanat , the Thai sources ! said , told Mr. Rogers yesterday that Thailand had no desire for American ground troops . But he urged the United States to expand its economic and military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Congressional amendment to an appropritions bill , which precludes the dispatch of American ground forces to Thailand or Laos without Congressional approval , did not mean that the Nixon Administration would succumb to Congressional pressure on the over-all commitment to Thailand . On Laos , Mr. Laird told the newsmen three times that American policy had not changed . He also repeated the Administration 's contention that no American ground troops , including Special Forces , were engaged in Laos and that air power had been used only to interdict the North Vietnamese supply line through Laos to South Vietnam . The State Department spokesman , Carl Bartch , reaffirmed today that a transcript of secret hearings on Laos held by Senator Stuart Symington , Democrat of Missouri , last fall would not be made public , as demanded by several Senators yesterday . Mr. Bartch referred , as did a White House spokesman , to the President 's earlier statement that disclosure of further information on Laos would not serve the public interest .                @ @ @ @ @
