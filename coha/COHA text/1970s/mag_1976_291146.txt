One is gruff , introverted , monotoned , a career soldier who holds the nation 's top political job . The other is suave , eloquent , literate , an instinctive politician in a key military post . Both men belong to the same generation of Israelis who grew up with the Jewish state 's struggle for survival-and yet , even though they are members of the same Cabinet , they are locked in a constant , fratricidal battle . In fact , the rivalry between Premier Yitzhak Rabin , 54 , and Defense Minister Shimon Peres , 53 , has become so intense that practically every issue in Israel 's hothouse politics polarizes into a struggle between their competing factions . Israel 's national elections are still one year away , but Peres has clearly emerged as the major threat to Rabin 's reelection . <P> The two men have clashed almost continuously since April 1974 , when the ruling Labor Party 's central committee , by a 298-to-254 vote , chose Rabin over Peres as its candidate to succeed Golda Meir as Premier . The latest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be governor of the Bank of Israel , the country 's No. 2 financial post . A gambling buff ( he favors the Las Vegas roulette table ) with an eye for pretty women , Yadlin is also a major fund raiser for the Labor Party ; since 1973 , he has headed Israel 's huge Kupat Holim health-insurance program . Yadlin was arrested in mid-October and is now being held by the police under suspicion of corruption and tax fraud . Rabin has withdrawn the Yadlin nomination , naming instead Arnon Gafny , director general of the Finance Ministry , to the bank post . <P> Psychological Warfare . Peres and his supporters have jumped on the Yadlin scandal as proof of Rabin 's poor judgment in making appointments . In the past , Peres and Rabin have openly disagreed over tactics and emphasis in such matters as the amount of military aid that Jerusalem should request from the U.S. ( Peres wanted more than Rabin ) and the disengagement with Egypt in the Sinai ( Peres wanted greater concessions from Egypt in exchange for a pullback of Israeli forces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which both Arab civilians and Israeli soldiers were injured , Rabin publicly attacked Peres ' Defense Ministry for its administration of the West Bank . <P> Rabin and Peres are both masters of upmanship . A leader of Israel 's elite Palmach commandos in 1948 and a hero of the 1967 war , Rabin seldom loses a chance to one-up his Defense Minister on military matters . During briefings by Peres ( who never served in uniform ) , Rabin has been known to swivel impatiently in his chair , scowl and then ignore his minister by shooting questions directly at uniformed generals present . Complains a Peres aide : " Right from the start , Rabin was out to humiliate Peres in any way he could . "
