As head of the special surgical team at New York Hospital , Dr. William Stubenbord routinely performs more than a hundred kidney transplants a year . But there was something special about one of his cases last week . The kidney that he transplanted into a 32-year-old man had been taken from a Russian teenager fatally injured only 48 hours earlier in a Moscow traffic accident . <P> The successful surgery was an encouraging example of medical dtente that began last summer when Dr. Albert Rubin , director of the hospital 's Rogosin Kidney Center , visited Moscow 's Institute of Transplantation , which is headed by the prominent surgeon Dr. Valery Shumakov . The two doctors agreed that exchanging information and technology could lead to improved care for kidney patients in both countries . Shumakov volunteered , as a first step , to send a kidney to American doctors . ( There are more kidneys available in the U.S.S.R. than in the U.S. because there are fewer legal obstacles to obtaining organs and fewer patients awaiting transplants . ) In the U.S. , at least half of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organs . Said Shumakov : " An exchange of kidneys to me is something more practical and tangible than an exchange of delegations . " <P> Packed in Ice . Shortly after the youth died , Shumakov transplanted one of the boy 's kidneys into a Soviet recipient , and directed his team to prepare the other for shipment to New York . Carefully preserved in sterile solution and wrapped in plastic bags and ice , the kidney was placed aboard a regularly scheduled Moscow-New York Aeroflot jet , while Shumakov sent word to U.S. doctors via a Soviet friend in New York that a kidney was on the way . Rushed by ambulance from the airport , the kidney was bathed in nutrient-rich fluid , then " typed " so that doctors could choose a recipient whose body tissue matched it . Out of the clinic 's list of some 200 potential candidates , the doctors picked Puerto Rican-born Jose Serrano , a former construction worker with incurably diseased kidneys who was alive only because he was hooked three times weekly , four hours a day , to a dialysis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " take " are usually no better than 50% , yet only twelve hours after surgery , Serrano 's new organ had already produced some five liters ( 5 quarts ) of urine and seemed to be functioning well . By week 's end Serrano was joking that despite his Muscovite kidney , " I do n't speak Russian yet . " His doctors were equally elated . Rubin , for one , envisioned a day when organs are regularly shuttled across the seas to fulfill needs wherever they exist . Said he : " What better way to bring the world together than through medicine . "
