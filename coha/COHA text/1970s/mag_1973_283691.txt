In the battle for power among the branches of Government , Watergate has clearly sapped Richard Nixon 's strength as President and greatly raised the might of Congress and the courts . For months Nixon argued bitterly that the Senate Watergate committee had no right to any of his private tape recordings and documents . Last week he was forced to give ground . <P> At the committee 's urging , Congress had passed a bill giving the courts authority to enforce the committee 's subpoenas . To head off more controversy , Nixon grudgingly let the bill become law . Explained a White House aide : " Politically , he had to do it . He truly thought that it was a bad bill , but he knew a veto would be misunderstood . " Within a day , the committee subpoenaed tapes of 486 White House meetings and several hundred supporting documents concerning the Watergate breakin , contributions to Nixon 's re-election drive , and campaign dirty tricks . <P> White House Counsel J. Fred Buzhardt accepted the committee 's subpoena but gave no indication whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considered the subpoena " incredible . " If the White House does not obey it , however , Committee Chairman Sam Ervin has vowed to ask the courts to force the Administration to comply . <P> Leaked Tape . That could set off another court battle over presidential tapes and documents . The first drew to a close last week . After listening to the tapes , Federal Judge John J. Sirica ruled that most of two and part of a third had nothing to do with the break-in and need not be given to Special Prosecutor Leon Jaworski . His office had subpoenaed them as evidence for the grand jury that will decide whether to indict more people in the Watergate case . <P> <P> Sirica ruled that of the three tapes , Jaworski should receive only 1 ) part of a tape including the famous 18-minute hum that recorded a meeting between Nixon and former Chief of Staff H.R. Haldeman on June 20 , 1972 ; 2 ) five minutes of references to Watergate on a tape of Nixon 's discussion on June 30 , 1972 , with former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the President 's re-election committee ; and 3 ) most of a tape of Nixon 's conference with former Counsel John W. Dean on Sept. 15 , 1972 , the day that the original seven Watergate defendants were indicted . Dean has testified that during the meeting , Nixon congratulated him on the " good job " he had done in preventing the indictments from going higher up . <P> One of Nixon 's arguments against surrendering the tapes was that they might be leaked , making private conversation public . Just such a leak occurred last week . A tape of a Nixon meeting with milk producers on March 23,1971 , had been subpoenaed from the White House by Attorney William Dobrovir as evidence in a civil suit challenging the Administration 's increase in milk-price supports . At a cocktail party in Washington attended by six other people , Dobrovir played five minutes of the tape " just for fun . " <P> Outraged Nixon aides suggested that Dobrovir had violated legal ethics , and two days later he was summoned to court . There he contritely conceded : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ B. Jones ordered all tapes and documents in the milk case to be sealed until presented in court .
