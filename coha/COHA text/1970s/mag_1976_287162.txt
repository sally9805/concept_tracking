About this time every year , officials in Government and industry begin wondering aloud whether the nation will have enough natural gas to make it through the winter . The speculations invariably revive the suggestion that there would be more of the clean , cheap fuel to go around if gas cost more and was more profitable to look for and produce . Last week the Federal Power Commission decided to put that perennial hypothesis to the test . By a 3-to-1 vote , the commissioners sharply jacked up the price of much of the natural gas that is now piped across state lines . If the decision holds up in court , the tab for consumers will swell by $1.5 billion over the next year alone . <P> The FPC has jurisdiction only over gas transported from state to state . Intrastate gas is not price controlled at all and averages $1.54 per thousand cu . ft . Since interstate gas is priced at either 29.5 per thousand cu . ft. ( for gas discovered before 1973 ) or 52 ( for " new " gas discovered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gas within the state in which it was found . To make interstate sales more profitable-and dampen consumption at the same time-the FPC lifted the price of new gas to $1.01 per thousand cu . ft. for gas found in 1973 and 1974 and $1.42 for gas newer than that . To encourage gas companies to shift their production to the interstate market , the commission added that any intrastate gas can be sold out of state at the highest new-gas price . <P> Court Action . The new gas affected by the FPC ruling accounts for only 25% of all interstate gas . As more and more new gas is found , the price of interstate natural gas will continue to rise . But even in the first year , the average consumer will be paying 6% more for gas . In a warm state like Florida , the added annual burden will only be about $5.20 , by the FPC 's estimate , but citizens of chillier Ohio can expect to spend an additional $23 . Only 20% of the price boost , noted the commission , would add @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to federal taxes , and 25% would cover increased production costs . <P> The FPC 's action cut right through the old and stagnant debate between the Administration and congressional liberals over the decontrol of interstate gas . Indeed , immediately after the decision was announced , a coalition composed of consumer groups , labor unions , anti-industry lobbies and the state of Minnesota charged in federal court that the commission had usurped congressional authority by de facto removing price controls on gas . The court issued a temporary stay of the FPC 'S order , and lengthy litigation is certain . The delay is good news for consumers , no matter who wins the case : each day of postponement saves gas users $4.1 million .
