ON MOUNTAINS : THINKING ABOUT TERRAIN by John Jerome Harcourt Brace Jovanovich 262 pages ; $8.95 <P> Last year John Jerome became a counterculture hero with the publication of Truck , an earthy account of his yearlong effort to rehabilitate a 1950 Dodge pickup . Now he turns his restive mind to loftier topics . On Mountains wittily bypasses the customary because-it-is-there rationale to examine the fascination and terror of peaks and promontories . <P> Jerome grew up in Houston , 50 ft. above sea level . He saw no real mountains until his late teens . Once he did , he was hooked . As he notes , those who are raised in hill country frequently take mountains for granted , as the Swiss did until they realized that other Europeans would pay to climb and ski ( and occasionally fall off ) their peaks . Others may be terrified of heights , like the 14th century travelers who went through the Alps blindfolded , lest the horrors of the tortuous scenery drive them mad . <P> But most flatlanders find that mountains stimulate both imagination and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; sooner or later , mountain gazers begin to wonder if there is room at the top . <P> Those who have made an ascent - whether to the top of the Matterhorn or to the less rarefied heights of a 1,000-ft. peak in their nearest state park-are likely to agree with Jerome 's paeans to the joys of topography . " Wonder and delight await , up there , " he says . So does " elbowroom for the soul . " Even those who have never left sea level will enjoy the au thor 's lofty musings . Jerome points out that a range like the Himalayas is still growing ( Everest may be more than a foot harder to climb in a hundred years than it is today ) and explains mountain weather with a clarity some science writers would do well to emylate . He speaks knowledgeably of avalanches , snow and the life that lives on mountains - from lemmings and insects to the snowmen , abominable and otherwise , who find everything from adventure to a quiet home in the stratosphere . <P> Some insist that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure . But he does believe that mountains help man to appreciate both his planet and himself . " Gradient is the elixir of youth , " declares a geologist , and he may be right . Flatlands , worn down to sea level by gravity and the forces of time , are old , almost senile . Mountains , no matter how ancient , are new and dynamic . No one can spend much time with them - or with Jerome 's high-minded volume - without feeling the same way . <P> - Peter Staler
