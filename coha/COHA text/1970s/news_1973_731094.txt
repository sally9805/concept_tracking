txt THE REGULAR customers keep pulling into the corner filling station at Archer and Western Avenues even tho they see the large orange fluorescent sign , proclaiming , " Sorry , No GAS . " Some drive in to buy a new air filter or to get a flat tire repaired or to hear Walt or hank make a joke that 's not a joke about the energy crisis . Walt and Hank Giergielewicz and their brother in law , Dick Stankiewicz , are the canaries in the mine . The first to go . They have n't had a drop of gas in two weeks and have no prospect for getting any . " It 's a shame , " said Albin . . Wilson , who has been trading at the independent station since 19.17 . " Nobody does a better job . See that jalopy over there , " she said , pointing to an ancient blue Checker . " If it were n't for them it would n't run . " THE PARTNERS always have done a brisk business on . the busy intersection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than 27 years at the same location . They have about $70,0110 tied up in the building and equipment and they own every brick . " But it 's not worth a damn , if we ai n't got the gas , " Walt said . For more than 2i ) the station had a leasing arrange ! ment with Oklahoma Oil Co. and then Humble Oil Co. when the later assumed Oklahoma 's operations .

" Then we went with Avalon Oil Co. , and they told us they could supply us for a year , but they cut us off in June . " THEN WE WERE buying from Gas City , but they told us the last week in November they were cut back and we were out . Since then , I must have called more than 100 places , everything I could find , but I ca n't find a drop , " Walt said . Hank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ altho. they used to open at 6 a. m. and now do n't arrive until 7 a. m . But most of their time is spent chewing the fat with people like Richard Schmook , who has been a customer for 15 years . " These guys are always willing to come out and get you if you 're in trouble , " Schmook said , " and it seems that they 're open when everybody else is closed . There ought to be someplace they could buy gas . " " IF WE HAD hurt somebody or if we did n't pay our bills or something , I could understand , " said Hank , " hut we never played dirty with anybody for 27 years and now it I , looks like we 're just going to be wiped out . " Walt figures they could keep 1 going with 3,000 gallons a I week I " I 'd even be willing to buy black market gas if could find any " ) because that would bring in enough custom-1 ers for repairs . " But I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , " and I honestly do n't know what we 'll be able to do . "
