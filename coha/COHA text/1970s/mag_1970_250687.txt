Which of the following rates after the Eiffel Tower and Orly Airport as France 's biggest tourist attraction ? <P> A. The Louvre <P> B. Versailles <P> C. The Chteau de Thoiry <P> The correct answer is C , a fact that is sure to dumbfound anyone who visited the museum-like Chteau de Thoiry prior to 1967-or before the historic building became the center of what must be the most unusual animal farm in the Western world . <P> It all started as a save-a-castle plan . Built in the 16th century in the lush lowlands 30 miles west of Paris , the chteau has long claimed a treasury of priceless furniture , rare tapestries and a collection of 60,000 documents and letters from kings , ministers and literary figures . Chopin 's piano-a gift from George Sand-graced the gilded music room ; the original manuscripts of two unpublished Chopin waltzes were discovered in a linen closet . <P> Gamy Strategy . None of this , however , kept the mighty roof from leaking , helped wash the 10,000 windowpanes , or prevented the spacious garden from going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 25 persons , " says the castle 's owner , the Count de la Panouse , " the domain falls apart . " To finance the estate , the chteau was opened to the public in 1966 , but the 20,000 visitors it drew that year were not enough to pay the bills . It was the count 's son Paul , now 26 , who persuaded his father to let him turn one end of the vast grounds into a zoo filled with bears , tigers , kangaroos , wolves and elephants . The young viscount 's gamy strategy worked : in 1967 , the number of visitors rose to 100,000 . <P> Next came the creation of a wild-game preserve . Wire fences were set up to isolate the 51 lions and a pack of hyenas . Other , less aggressive animals-ostriches , rhinoceroses , elephants and zebras - were simply set loose to live together . <P> As the number of visitors increased , so did the innovations . A vivarium housing a host of giant spiders and a reptile collection ( starring an 80-year-old alligator ) was built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ zoo usurped one corner of the grounds ; 280 monkeys , brought all the way from Southeast Asia , were set loose and swinging in the 15 acres of beech , oak and hickory trees . Parking facilities were established , as well as a restaurant , picnic area , gas station and that necessary adjunct to the tourist trade , a photo and souvenir shop . <P> <P> The total cost was $3,000,000 . But with 1,000,000 visitors in 1969 , Thoiry is quickly paying back the investment . <P> Traumatized Animals . Science too will profit from the Thoiry menagerie if the viscount has his way : he plans to study the behavior of the birds and beasts on the plush grounds of the chteau . " In nature , " Paul explains , " the animals vanish before you can really watch them , and in zoos they are so traumatized that their behavior is never authentic . But here at the Chateau de Thoiry , we have particularly favorable conditions . " <P> Never more so than on one recent night , when some 1,000 paying visitors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first in a projected series of orchestral concerts . The program , chosen by the viscount himself , suited both the occasion and the location : Saint-Saens ' Carnival of the Animals , Prokofiev 's Peter and the Wolf , and Haydn 's celebration to The Bear .
