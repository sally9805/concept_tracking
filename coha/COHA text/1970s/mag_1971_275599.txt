TO bring order and meaning to the news - to cast a sharp , bright light on the major events of each week - has always been a cardinal aim of TIME . In recent years a growing number of issues and events have transcended the ordinary boundaries of section headings and cover stories . These exceptional subjects have demanded the broader focus of a special section encompassing many areas . One major topic - Black America - commanded a special issue . <P> This week TIME 'S readers will find a special section on " The Cooling of America " - an examination of the nation 's new mood , still uncertain but distinctly changed from a few months ago , the mood of a country still beset by problems but weary of constant confrontation . The project was born , explains Senior Editor Jason McManus , " out of a journalistic sense of something stirring in the land that no one had quite captured , corner-of-the-eye perceptions that needed to be looked at head-on and related to one another . " <P> To do so , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peter Vanderwicken analyzed the role of the recession in easing social tensions . Greg Wierzynski , our Boston-based education correspondent , spent much of his time last year dodging rocks and tear gas . This year he found the boards gone from shop windows in Harvard Square and the students getting on with the business of learning . <P> New York Correspondent Karsten Prager noted much the same sense in the black community , where " black moves on the political and economic front are clearly not as eye-catching as the sit-ins , protests and mass demonstrations of the 1960s . " San Francisco Bureau Chief Jesse Birnbaum , who has long observed neighboring Berkeley as well as the radical scene generally , contributed the section on the New Left 's retrenchment . He drew on the work of New York Correspondent Robert Anson , who recently turned from the conflicts in Southeast Asia ( he was captured by the Communists in Cambodia last August ) to those at home . Los Angeles Correspondent Tim Tyler spot lighted the counterculture , which has long been his special beat . Washington Bureau @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town of Greenfield , Iowa , described the mood as perceived both in Middle America and in the capital . <P> The introduction to the entire section was the work of Associate Editor Lance Morrow who , in evaluating the present situation , was struck " by a sense of fragility and tentativeness . The mood could change very abruptly . But for the moment , I think that people are tired of both fatuous optimism and fatuous pessimism regarding America . "
