The scandalous cost overruns in defense contracts largely have been due to a Pentagon system called Total Package Procurement , or TPP , which was started by former Defense Secretary Robert McNamara . TPP contractors did not have to build prototypes , and they were allowed to kick up prices if they were hit by inflation or unforeseen technical problems . Result : foxy contractors " bought in " to contracts by deliberately underbidding , then collected huge overruns as costs soared . <P> After long urging by former Deputy Secretary of Defense David Packard , the Pentagon is now moving to a fixed-price " fly-before-you-buy " system . In the first award in years under this system , Fairchild Industries ' Republic Division , - based on Long Island , was picked last week to produce the A-10 combat support plane . Fairchild landed the contract only after it agreed to hold prices to $1.4 million per plane and its prototype won a " fly-off " against a plane made by California 's Northrop Corp . If the A-10 continues to please the Air Force after the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rise to 720 planes , creating more than $1 billion in revenues for Fairchild and some 4,500 jobs for the depressed aerospace industry of Long Island .
