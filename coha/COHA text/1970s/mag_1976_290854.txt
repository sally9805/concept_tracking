The usually sedate French National Assembly has lately become a scene of turmoil and dissension . Cabals of Deputies huddle up and down the splendid baronial halls . Ministers discuss the latest parliamentary tricks . The visitors ' gallery is packed . Reason for all the drama : President Valry Giscard d'Estaing 's proposed capital gains tax . <P> Giscard 's measure , formally before the National Assembly after two years of preparation , is a favored part of his much-publicized program to reform France into an " advanced liberal society . " It is also his first move to touch the well-guarded French pocketbook . Giscard is well aware of the fact that as a nation , France has turned tax evasion into a national pastime , costing the government , by some guesses , $12 billion a year in uncollected revenues . It is estimated , for example , that the country 's 2.3 million self-employed people declare only half of their income by such devices as keeping double sets of books and asking for payment in cash . As a result , the government is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sales taxes reaching as high as 33.3% . <P> Chorus of Protest . Giscard 's capital gains tax measure is designed to shift some of the financial burden away from income and value-added taxes to the kind of capital gains levy on the sale of stocks and property that is common to virtually every advanced industrial country . Affecting only some 300,000 people and bringing in a mere 3.3% of all taxes , the measure is certainly modest . Nonetheless , it has stirred up a chorus of protest from Lille to Nice . <P> Paris Match called the idea a " new Trafalgar , " and reported ( probably inaccurately ) that $1 billion had flowed out of France toward Switzerland in the one day after the bill was proposed . The powerful Socialist and Communist opposition parties condemned the measure for containing too many loopholes favoring the rich . The Communists have even been acting as defenders of middle-class property-especially over the part of Giscard 's proposal that calls for taxes on the sale of vacation homes , the rsidences secondaires owned by 14 million <P> Frenchmen . Proclaimed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Assembly : " This bill menaces the family property and rsidences secondaires of many small landowners-the little people . " <P> Open Rebellion . The leftists also gleefully watched as Giscard 's customary supporters attacked the new tax idea for precisely the opposite reason : that it was too radical . Proclaimed Gaullist Deputy Hector Rolland : " This bill should be thrown into the oubliette , from which it should never have escaped . " Worst of all , from Giscard 's standpoint , Gaullist Premier Jacques Chirac maintained a conspicuous silence during the entire controversy , apparently trying to distance himself from the unpopular tax measure .
