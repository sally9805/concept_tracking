PHIL PRIMACK , Rawlins , Wyo. or this town just east of the ' Continental Divide , mineral development is no new thing . Rawlins , after all , is the seat of , a county called Carbon . And coal froth this area fueled much of the early expansio ? of the Union Pacific Railroad in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries . What is new , however , is the scale and intensity of the mineral exploitation today . Not only is far more coal being mined and processed than ever before in the Rawlins area but vast oil , gas and uranium reserves are now also being tapped and developed . Such major energy conglomerates as Sinclair and Getty are becoming increasingly active . In short , Rawlins has crossed the fuzzy but costly line from steady growth to ' outright boom . Of course , to a country warned daily of a coming energy apocalypse , the problems of places like Rawlins and Wyoming seem minor league . After all , what 're a few Rawlinses , or Circle , Montanas , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Middle East to worry about ? But in places like Rawlins , some longtime residents are paying the price for the frantic search for energy . True , the boom has offered high-paying jobs which may even be recession-proof for a lot of new people . Unfortunately , Rawlins is running out of places for these people to live . In fact , in only one part of the city  --  the South Side  --  can you legally place a mobile home today . Indeed , if land and services were available in that old flood plain , it 's likely that trailers would be forming into a metallic herd . Most of the people desperately looking for places to live are white and well paid . Most of the people living in the South Side are Hispanic , people with a long history of local economic and social discrimination . They are now starting to wonder just how the boom and their community are like- , ly to mix in these next few years . Located on the wrong side of the Union Pacific tracks from downtown Rawlins , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homes , some dating back to the days of the railroad boom , which originally spawned the neighborhood . While some new housing has been built in recent years , a sign of the current growth which has rewarded many in Rawlins , including some in the South Side , with better-paying jobs and opportunities , the neighborhood remains in many ways an ethnic enclave . The 1970 census reported that more than 1,700 people lived in this section of Rawlins , which had a total population of 7,855 that year . About 70 percent of the South Side 's residents were Mexican-Americans . The proportion of minority people in Rawlins has probably since declined , because most of the new arrivals , who have doubled the town 's population in the past decade , are white . Job gains by minorities have probably been as much due to affirmative action requirements as local labor demand . For years this separate community has had to do without sidewalks , adequate sewers , curbs and gutters . A grant from the Department of Housing and Urban Development , supplemented by city money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amenities long taken for granted in most other parts of Rawlins . Some South Siders wo n't believe the improvement plan until the asphalt is laid . A few even wonder who will eventually be attracted to the neighborhood  --  whether by design or happenstance  --  by the improvements . " I do n't think the majority of people here realize it yet , " said Sadie Garcia , " but this big crowd and big money coming in is going to push us out . They 're going to find excuses to move the Spanish people out , tear down our houses and put up trailer courts . " That concern is now felt by only a small number of South Side residents . " They ca n't make you sell your house , " said Max Martinez , who came to Rawlins from New Mexico in 1920 . Besides , he added , " sometimes it 's better to live in new trailers than in some of the shacks around here . " Still , he feels that the South Side has long been neglected , and doubts that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changed much recently . , Martinez 's son , DeBari , is one of two Hispanics on the seven-member Rawlins City Council . The gains that have been made in the South Side have come slowly , he said . The main improvement has been in individual job opportunities . " Ten years ago there were only two places to work here , the railroad or the oil refinery , and the railroad simply did n't hire Spanish peOple . Now people are getting jobs and making more . Even in view of the inflation here , bread may be $1 a loaf instead of 40 cents , but at least you can buy it . " Nevertheless , Martinez is worried about the future of the South Side as a community . " For a , long time we were neglected simply because we were Chicano . Now it 's gone to a different Level  --  the discrimination against us is because we 're the other side of the tracks , an old part of a growing town . Everyone is more interested in the new developments going up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new ones , " where people who are More affluent and pay more taxes reside . Viewed from a hill above the South Side , the main part of Rawlins rises beyond the tracks . The South Side nestles in its own little hollow , the green and brown roofs giving it the look ' of an old settlement . But the acres of land being excavated all around signify an encroaching building boom . Major new housing and trailer developments , including new town house condominiums occupied mainly by newcomers , contrast sharply with the small frame and stucco homes that dominate the South Side . Many of those homes are substandard . But , according to Pauline Gonzalez , " People are afraid to complain or request funds for repairs , because then their homes might be condemned . " It 's hard enough for anyone to find a place to live in boom towns like Rawlins , but for low-income or fixed-income older people , finding housing they can afford is nearly impossible . - . , , Gonzalez is the organizer for the Concerned Citizens of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make the city more responsive to the neighborhood 's needs . " Because some of our people are doing a lot better today , they 're not looking enough at some of the negative aspects we 're starting to feel , " she said . Like other energy towns in the West , Rawlins is facing the backswing of the economic-development pendulum . Older residents of the city tend to feel the economic burdens most , particularly since they generally have lower incomes than the new boomers to whom much of the local economy is now geared . Older and minority people may feel it hardest at first , but for many longtime residents , things are getting very tight . Rents for one-bedroom apartments start at $400 a month , and people feel lucky even to find them . The overall cost of living is spurred by national double-digit inflation corn-pounded by a local boom surcharge . If you 're making the big money from boom jobs , you still do pretty well . But an analysis of Rawlins 's employment patterns reveals a sharp polarization in incomes . About @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are probably having an increasingly difficult time living on what they earn . In this latter group are many of Rawlins 's longtime residents . In December 1978 , more than 8,300 people had jobs in Carbon County ,  - -  a 200 ' percent increase in just five years . About half were in mining , manufacturing or construction . The rest were in service and support jobs . The biggest single employer was mining , where 2,700 workers averaged $471 a week , according toi " the Employment Security Commission of Wyoming . The next biggest job supplier was " services with agriculture , forestry and fisheries , " which along with railroading had long been the economic staple of the county . The 1,800 people , working in this group averaged only $168 a week  --  about a third of what the miners were making . Six hundred construction workers averaged $244 a week , and about 400 manufacturing employees earned almost $320 . But the 1,440 people working in retail trade averaged just $149 a week-abOdelialf as much as the 353 employees in the transportation , communications and utilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The inflationary and population pressures created by newcomers holding jobs in energy-related companies have caused most of the'eConomic problems in Rawlins . Those who have held steady retail or other service jobs for years ? now find that the $3 or $4 an hour wage which was once adequate simply is insufficient today . One result is an increase in two-wageLearner households , according to Marie Hill of the Carbon County Job Security Office . Women have found some work in the better-paying energy field , but not generally at high levels , she said . Overall , the county 's unemployment rate is only 1.3 percent . " This is a job-seekers ' market , " Hill said . The influx of people hoping to land the big boom paychecks continues , she added , despite the housing shortage . The few " Help Wanted " ads in a recent Rawlins Daily Times were mainly for waitresses , motel maids , hotisekeepers , clerks and baby sitters . ( The classified section incidentally , no longer carries rental listings  --  why advertise buried treasure ? ) Most of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But you just ca n't make it on that kind of money . " And older people and single parents either ca n't afford or are unable to drive the forty miles or more which is sometimes necessary for the bigger-paying jobs . " We have a lot of people who because of lack of education or living situations ca n't cash in those ' jobs , ' y Gonzalez said . " And they 're really hurting . " While low-income and minority groups have long had to cope with such economic pressures , many others in Rawlins are beginning to learn that it can cost a lot to be prosperous . The trend that has seen the town 's population dotible within a decade is likely to continue well into the 1980s . Those new people will require housing and adequate sewer and water systems . They bring with them the need for extra police , fire , school and other services . The net result is that while Rawlins 's vastly increased total assessed valuation has kept individual property taxes from rising , the basic cost of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the growth , " said assistant city engineer Kim Keaton , " and we are getting further and further behind . " The fee for connecting a new house to sewer and water lines is now nearly $1,500 . Monthly fees for these services are about to double . And on top of such routine costs , the city estimates that it needs at least $50 million in basic capital improvements before it can accommodate the 25,000 people Rawlins is likely to have within a few years . Most of the new developments put up to house these people are outside the city limits and contribute no city taxes . Wyoming law makes it nearly impossible for towns or counties to assess companies for the added costs engendered by their work force requirements , so , the financial and tax burden falls on permanent residents . And it is these same longtime Rawlins people who are often making far less money than the new arrivals . " People who have lived here for a long time are paying again for the privilege of living in Rawlins , Wyoming , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that if the development is going to continue , these companies are Simply going to have to be more responsive to the communities . " She is not overly-optimistic that they will be . Beyond the financial problems , concern is also growing in , . all Western development areas about threats to the quality of life . The Small-town life style is often stripped away like - the topsoil covering the coal and uranium . Even so , many local families are finding such costs acceptable since the jobs - that result at least offer the chance for children to work , and - continue to live , in Rawlins . Pauline Gonzalez , for instance , Jas deep roots in the South Side . Her father was a sheepherder , her mother did motel cleaning and hospital work . Of Jive sisters and one brother , all except- one remain in the awlins area . Her husband works at the oil refinery and of Dier six children , all are either working locally or in school . This is a not uncommon South Side family arrangement . To many , the availability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important to Chicano culture . Yet even strong family ties are undergoing stress as a ! result of the boom cycle . " Historically , Chicano families absorb old people into their homes , " said Betty Chavez-Holcomb . " But if the children are already hard pressed financially , this could cause tremendous social problems . ' This pressure , combined with all the changing values being i ntroduced by the new people coming in , is starting to cause real strains on the structure of families . " That problem is not limited to the South Side , or to Raw-tins , of course . Rapidly growing areas throughout the West report that the increase in social and financial pressures , combined with the transient nature of boomer life , can cause family breakdown and increased spouse and child abuse . In 1972 , only two cases of child abuse were reported in Carbon County , according to Ray Ring of the Department of Public Assistance and Social Services . " It looks like we 'll end up with about thirty-five this year , " he said . Ring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his agency is able to handle such increased problems even though the staff " is basically the same size as it was in 1965 . " He admitted that older and fixed-income people " are getting killed " by the local cost of living , but insisted that he " has more goddamn money than we can spend " for aid and services . " There 's no real poverty in this county today , " Ring claims , " except in some large families and among illiterate people . " He said that most requests for emergency relief come from transients who have n't yet landed jobs . " There 's no excuse for any able person in this county to be unemployed . " Gonzalez and others charge that Ring 's office does a poor outreach job , and that many who , peed such benefits as food stamps do n't know how to go about getting them , or otherwise find the department " a hostile place to go . " That view seemed to be generally shared within the South Side . " It 's part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They do n't want to help us out , even when we 're long overdue for it . " " A lot of people around here would like to have better homes , " said 76-year-old Alfonzo Sandoval . " I 'm one of them . But I do n't want to go into debt , and I , do n't want to give up what I have . " Living on a $392-a-month railroad pension and the income from two part-time jobs , Sandoval claims he can barely get by . He currently has an outstanding $1,500 hospital bill . , " All I have is the value of my home , " Sandoval said . It 's a tenuous feeling of security . He worries that the influx of trailers in developments in and near the South Side will cause property values to go down . Perhaps more ominous , he and others realize that trailer courts have a way of spreading  --  and the South Side is the only part of Rawlins where trailers may locate . Gonzalez is frustrated that more people in her own community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do all kinds of things , " she said . " But when minorities do it , it 's a threat . Somehow we become militants . We have a lot of work to do if we 're going to get through all this development and survive . " Sadie Garcia agrees : " I 've been here for twenty-six years. , It was a boom town then , which was why we came  --  my husband was a bartender and gambler . " Now Rawlins is a boom town again , only bigger and probably more enduring . Even so , Garcia is n't sure it will last . " I think the future 's going to be kind of hard , on us here in the South Side , " she said . " We 're going to be feeling a whole lot of pressure . " ' She could have been speaking for communities throughout the Northern Plains and Rockies ; the mix , of diesel and sagebrush is sending disquieting portents across the prairies. ?            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
