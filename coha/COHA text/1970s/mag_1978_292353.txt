" Look , " said Ribicoff , " this is a tough one for everybody " <P> The controversy over the warplane sale might never have come to the Senate floor at all if Frank Church , the Foreign Relations Committee chairman-to-be , had not backed out of an agreement to support it . The story of how and why Church changed his mind provides an illuminating view of Congress at work . TIME Congressional Correspondent Neil MacNeil reports : <P> It all began on April 11 in the gracious apartment of Senator Abraham Ribicoff of Connecticut . For dinner that night , he and his wife entertained Secretary of State Cyrus Vance , Senators Frank Church and Ted Kennedy and Scotty Reston of the New York Times . Over duck I'orange , the men had a free-flowing talk about the nation 's foreign policies , including the newly announced plan to sell military aircraft in a package to Israel , Egypt and Saudi Arabia , a matter already causing intense debate . <P> After dinner , Ribicoff took Vance off to a corner . The Senator had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were some way to avoid the acrimony that had already begun . <P> " Cy , " he said , " this is a tough one . Is there any way we can work this out ? Is there any give on this ? " <P> " Yes , " Vance said , " I think there is some give . " <P> Vance was about to leave for Africa and Moscow , and Ribicoff that weekend flew out to Phoenix to make a speech . In his hotel room there , he watched CBS 's Sunday program Face the Nation . Senator Howard Baker was the guest , and he suggested flexibility on the number of planes involved and the conditions of sale . Two days later , back in Washington , Ribicoff approached Baker on the Senate floor , privately . <P> " Howard , " he said , " what you said has the makings of a solution to the plane deal . Are you interested ? " <P> When Baker indicated a willingness to talk further , Ribicoff found Senators Church and Jacob Javits and brought them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this is a tough one for everybody . I think Howard has the makings of working something out . " <P> <P> After Baker left , Ribicoff took Church and Javits into a private room behind the chamber . Church was angry about the President 's having presented the three sales as a package . <P> " It 's an insult to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , " he said . " The President has no right to do this to us . Each proposal has to come up separately . If that is done by the President , and we can work out something along the lines Baker suggested , I 'd be willing to publicly state in the Foreign Relations Committee that we are for the sale of the F-15s to Saudi Arabia in the national interest . " " So would I , " said Javits . <P> Ribicoff was delighted . " If there 's agreement between Baker , Church , Javits and Ribicoff , " he said , " there 's no one going to oppose it against that combination . " <P> Ribicoff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Byrd and told him what he had in mind . " God bless you , Abe , " Byrd said .
