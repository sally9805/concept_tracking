Rather like building a new Saudi Arabia in the U.S. <P> Even if Congress rejects some parts of Jimmy Carter 's ambitious new design , the rising price of petroleum seems destined to awaken the nation from its energy stupor . As the cost of crude climbs , more and more technologies-some of them new and exotic , others as familiar as moonshine stills and windjammer sailing ships-are beginning to come on stream to conserve fuel and produce energy for the 1980s from unconventional sources . Clever inventors and canny investors see prospects of becoming instant energy millionaires . Long stagnant industries such as coal and steel stand to recover and prosper . Resource-rich regions can expect to surge as new plants and mines start up and create jobs . <P> Most of these developments eventually would have occurred even if Carter had not introduced his new energy package . But his complex and costly program , provided it is ever enacted by Congress , will accelerate the trends by stimulating investment and spurring technological breakthroughs . Says Economist Arthur Okun : " If there is an Edwin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country with a bright idea for energy production , a big carrot is being held out for him . " <P> The regions that stand to benefit most are coal-heavy Appalachia and the Rocky Mountain states , site of most of the nation 's oil shale and some of its most promising new sources of coal and oil . The U.S. Gulf Coast may also be awash with dollars , as drilling companies search for hard-to-get methane gas in deep rock strata . In grain-growing Iowa , Kansas and other farm-belt states , some 1,000 service stations are selling gasohol , made from gasoline with a 10% lacing of grain alcohol , and Carter 's program would enable production to jump . Says Robert Chambers of Iowa 's A.C.R. Process Corp. , an engineering firm for distilleries : " I 've been dealing with a lot of people who have not yet given us the go-ahead to order equipment , but the President 's program will make a great deal of difference . " From California to New England , investment bankers are pulling together various backers for alcohol ventures . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President Nelson Rockefeller 's 1975 plan for a $100 billion Energy Independence Authority , would profit many companies , small and large alike . Any rush to build synfuel plants would bring new orders for makers of steel , drilling-equipment tools and construction machinery . Says Julian Ward , vice president at Houston 's Brown &; Root construction firm : " Any company with design-engineering and construction capability is going to have a part of this thing-it 's so big . The spending would sop up the entire U.S. **25;4776;TOOLONG know-how . No one should be disappointed if only half of the program comes to pass . " <P> General Electric , Westinghouse and other manufacturers of boilers or electrical generating machinery would compete for many orders from utilities that have to switch from oil-fired operations to coal . Firms that make excavating and earth-moving equipment-Bucyrus-Erie , International Harvester , Allis-Chalmers and others-would encounter a burst of demand from mine operators for conveyors , cranes , bulldozers , loaders , power shovels and dragline equipment .                @ @ @ @ @
