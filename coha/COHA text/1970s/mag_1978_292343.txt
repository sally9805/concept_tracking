ON PRESS <P> by Tom Wicker <P> Viking ; 271 pages ; $10.95 <P> Spiro Agnew , in his days as chief White House press scourge , once called Tom Wicker " the boy wonder of opinion makers . " Half right . Though his New York Times columns can be pearls of persuasive good sense , Wicker is hardly a Wunderkind . At 51 , he has been a foot soldier in the service of truth , newspaper division , for nearly three decades . He has risen from the Sandhill Citizen of Aberdeen , N.C.-a backwoods weekly for which he sold ads , laid out pages and , incidentally , covered the news . He has been a White House correspondent , Washington bureau chief , columnist and bestselling author ( A Time to Die , about his role as mediator in the 1971 Attica rebellion ; Facing the Lions , a 1973 political novel ) . <P> In On Press , Wicker retraces the road from Aberdeen to Times Square , pausing for frequent pit stops : anecdota , place-dropping and sermonettes on how the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or otherwise worthy of punishment . The preaching , like Wicker 's daily columns , is honest , pertinent-and excruciatingly self-evident . After a long retelling of his experiences covering election campaigns , for instance , he concludes weakly that " in modern times , it seems to me , the so-called ' media ' - television pre-eminent among them-provide the true arena of politics ... That is the fundamental reason for the decline of party in American politics . " Such vintage bromides frequently obscure Wicker 's talent for seeing the human cartoon and the irony that resides in American politics . <P> Here is young Tom as sports editor of the Lumberton , N.C. , daily in pre-Warren Court days , confronted by a war party of angry local baseball players after he had accidentally desegregated the box scores . Here he is , older but unbowed , battling with the Times 's infamous New York editors , one of whom once interrupted him on a presidential trip to demand a reconciliation between his story and the Associated Press version . Wicker shot back : " My story 's right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's down in the bar , drunk . " He inks an indelible portrait of Lyndon Johnson , who liked to hang the Presidential Seal on a bale of hay at his Texas ranch , hold a brief press conference and ride off on his horse . The columnist also remembers an intense young man who showed up in his Washington office with fantastic tales of U.S. duplicity . Wicker sent him away for lack of proof ; three years later the visitor , Daniel Ellsberg , returned to the Times with the Pentagon papers . <P> On the subject of those papers , Wicker meanders to one of his few passionate assertions : short of war and other immediate threats to life , there is hardly any justification for claiming " national security " as an excuse for keeping things from the public . He also denounces competition as an evil force in journalism , resulting less often in better news coverage than in sensationalism . Some hard-charging reporters may find Wicker 's assertion mildly heretical .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
