Notes and Comment THE subpoenas served on the Times and its reporter Myron Farber at the request of the defense in the murder trial of Dr. Mario E. Jascalevich require them to turn over to the court all notes and memos written in connection with Farber 's articles on the case . There is wide agreement among reporters that the subpoenas , if they survive appeal , will set a legal precedent that will seriously damage reporters ' ability to gather news . They contend that sources who wish to remain anonymous will simply cease to speak once it becomes clear that reporters can be forced to disclose their informants ' names in court . These sources , it is pointed out , would no more want to confide in such reporters than they would want to confess their sins to priests who were obliged to pass on to the local police station everything they had been told . Even from the standpoint of law enforcement , the results will be ironic , because reporters who can be compelled to identify their sources in court are n't going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As soon as the courts start fishing for evidence in this pond , the pond will dry up . The courts will then lose not only any confidential information that the reporters may have possessed but also the articles based on that information  --  articles that on many occasions in the past have brought the very existence of crimes to the government 's attention in the first place . Thus , at a single stroke the judicial system will defeat both the First Amendment and itself . These dangers seem to us reason enough to reject the subpoenas , but there are other dangerous consequences , which are also worth consideration . They concern not freedom of speech but freedom of thought . Freedom of speech is guaranteed by the Constitution and freedom of thought is unmentioned there , but in practice the two freedoms belong together . The Times subpoena calls for notes that were made in preparation fur the writing of articles . Notes of this kind are usually nothing but aids to memory , and , as such , are auxiliary to thought . You might call them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they are tentative , provisional , experimental . They may even be unfounded , wild , irresponsible . Inside the mind , a freedom reigns that is less confined than any speech  --  a freedom amounting , in fact , to license . This reckless , unbridled quality of thought seems to be desirable in the production of even the most sober writings . But the thoughts themselves  --  and the notes that reflect them  --  were never meant for presentation to the world . Even when they are notes of conversations with others , they are indiscriminately inclusive , and may contain much that is trivial , gossipy , malicious , inaccurate , or actually untrue . Another kind of notes  --  for first drafts and the like  --  may contain false starts , wrong guesses , and foolish or worthless notions of every kind . In short , a writer 's notes contain precisely everything that he and his newspaper have rejected for publication . In groping behind published works for information , the government does more than cause writers the embarrassment of seeing their unpolished drafts dragged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's thoughts . If prior restraint ( prevention of publication ) has a chilling effect on free speech , then obligatory disclosure of notes ( enforcement of publication ) has a chilling effect on free thought . For although the licentious profusion of words and ideas that shows up in a writer 's notes is unworthy of public exposure , it is essential to the work that precedes publication . It can he said of some of these notes that they are the record of a writer 's interview with himself . It may be here in the solitude of the mind  --  that freedom real ) begins . In these silent exchanges , a writer becomes his own source . And this source , more than any other , perhaps , requires confidentiality , and without confidentiality will refuse to tell the world what it knows . ? ? Puzzles MARION R. FRAZIER , called Bob , who is New York 's only full-time professional repairer of what are known as reproducing grand pianos and reproducing pipe organs , and of nickelodeons , barrel organs , orchestrions , and player @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tackle anything " ? was lying flat on his back the other day under a Knabe grand in the middle of a large loft on the twelfth , and top , floor of 12 East Twelfth Street , an old commercial building near the northern edge of Greenwich Village . All attention , Frazier was hooking a nickel-plated brass tube to a 1928 Ampico vacuum pump that had been screwed to the underside of the piano . Joel Levine , Frazier 's colleague  --  the sign on the door says " Automatic Musical Instruments " ? is the city 's only full-time professional repairer of music boxes . Levine , who is thirty-one , was standing at a milling machine near the front of the loft carefully cutting a new steel comb for a closet-size , mahogany-cased disc music box built in 1896 by the Regina Music Box Company , of Rahway , New Jersey . Frazier is thirty-three . The two men met two and a half years ago at the Skyrink , on West Thirty-third ( They both like to ice-skate , and Levine still pops over there regularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) Levine discovered that six years ago Frazier , who was born in Newark , got tired of a succession of jobs ( sheet-metal work , waiting on tables , selling cologne in a department store , working as a Wall Street teletypist , setting up industrial displays ) , decided to buy a reproducing piano , rebuilt its mechanism on a coffee tray in his living room , and went into the repair business . Frazier found out that four years ago Levine , who was born in Cedarhurst , stopped being an engineer designing control circuits for nuclear reactors , bought a small music box , fixed it up on a butcher-block table in his bedroom , and was then thinking about making this into a profession . The joint venture has been a success because of a new demand both for music boxes , which were a national craze back in the nineties , and for reproducing pianos , which were a beguiling caprice thirty years later , in the twenties . Collectors abound ; one group , the Musical Box Society International , has twenty-five hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty-fifth anniversary . In reproducing pianos , which were to player pianos as a Swiss Army knife is to a letter opener , an electric motor powered a sophisticated pneumatic hookup , and when a scroll of perforated paper was snicked in under the keyboard a piano did n't just bring forth the notes of a work by Richard Strauss  --  Strauss himself in visibly played his own composition . Or that was the idea . Strauss , Josef Lhivinne , Ossip Gabribiwitsch , and other great masters recorded extensively on reproducing-piano rolls and , for a consideration , certified the fidelity of the recordings . The recordings were able to encode thirty different variations in dynamic- expression , or twice as many as the ear can detect , and they could add certain protobionic extravagances  --  for instance , chords consisting of far more notes than any ten fingers can hit simultaneously . The results arc probably at least as good as a live performance by a pianist who has been studying for seven or eight years . Music boxes are mechanical , not pneumatic ; they 're powered by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ versions of the famous medieval clock towers that sounded the hours with carillons and oddly moving human , animal , and fantastic figures . Swiss craftsmen whose families had been brought up in the watch business dominated the music-box business for most of the nineteenth century , and they came up with what is called sublime harmony  --  the gimmick that makes music boxes so charming , The boxes produced music when a brass cylinder with pins just barely projecting from it , like stubble on a teen-ager , revolved against the tuned teeth of a Sheffield-steel comb . This made pleasant , tinkly music that could not he heard from any great distance . Adding a second comb , tuned just a few beats lower than the first , produced  --  somehowthe sublime harmony : a great big , jolly tinkly sound that could be heard across a large room . Then came a man named Miguel Boom , who patented the first disc music box , in Port-au-Prince , Haiti , in 1882 ; this was a refinement , because the music was encoded on a thin steel disc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consequently , it was much easier to build up a library of runes  --  which , of course , made the music box a much more versatile instrument . Other refinements included music boxes that could play for an hour on one winding ; music boxes that sounded like a mandolin or a harpsichord ; and music boxes with tuned silver bells , small drums , and even castanets . In the nineties , German industry mass-produced disc boxes in Leipzig . Frazier 's and Levine 's loft is full of music and the sounds of machinery during working hours . There 's very little conversation : " Joel , help me lift this piano . " " Bob , have you seen my Swiss files ? " All around the floor are workshop projects and tools . The other day , there were pipes from three different reproducing pipe organs ( this organ is the ultimate refinement of the reproducing piano , and the Frick Museum has one ) ; a Swiss cylinder music box made for a maharaja , which plays only sitar music ; several lathes , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a couple of band saws ; three reproducing grand pianos ; a music box whose silver bells are struck by wooden clappers carved to suggest the heads of mandarins ; and an Imhof &; Mukle orchestrion  --  a gigantic piece of Black Forest furniture the size of a confessional which automatically plays piano , Chinese cymbal , mandolin , two drums , organ pipes that simulate violins , and a glockenspiel . ( The Central Park merry-go-round has a Wurlitzer orchestrion ; Frazier and Levine would love to be asked to work on it . ) Under a grand piano slept Cosmo , Frazier 's Great Dane . On top of a barrel organ , Nadu , Frazier 's big black cat , was washing its face . " Hardly a musical instrument exists that someone has n't attempted at some point to make mechanical , " Frazier said . " What I like is using my ingenuity to solve little puzzles , " Levine said . " How do you get the steel spring out of a cylinder ? A steel spring can be over thirty feet Long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back in ? Things like that . So far , I 've had to teach myself wood-turning and locksmithing just to repair a music box . " In a corner we found Ida Heyman , one of Levine 's assistants , polishing brass music-box components  --  butterflies , snails , and worms , these parts are called . Two months earlier , Ida Heyman had been a job-placement counsellor for ex-offenders . " I think this is the best job I 've ever had , " she told us . " I 'm one of Santa 's helpers . It 's a switch from sitting at a desk amid a swirl of babble and chatter and gossip and complaints , smoking cigarette after cigarette as the phone rings . If a music box is broken , it does n't complain about it  --  it just sits there quietly . Working with my hands , I get to learn how things fit together , how they work , and now I can very easily translate that into working on something else . To me , the whole place is magic . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know who lives on a farm in Rhode Island : We have a lot of starlings living around our farmhouse and nesting in our barn . I have ambivalent feelings about them . I know I am supposed to dislike starlings , because they are interlopers rather than native birds , and because there arc too many of them . They evict other , gentler birds from nesting places . They flock together , making mess and noise that greatly annoy some people . On the other hand , I like to see them walking across my lawn in phalanxes with a busy , businesslike stride , as they search for Japanese-beetle grubs that I am glad to get rid of . Also , in the spring , when I go out to the barn and hear their nuptial songs , I find them varied and beautiful . This year , the nuptial songs were followed by the cheeping of a multitude of baby starlings  --  perhaps actually only a dozen , since that 's all it takes for baby starlings to sound like a multitude . They are very vocal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , first from one corner of the barn , then from another , as the parents came with food . One of the nests was on a beam high over the doorway . Just when my husband and I were busiest , getting in deleted material business of getting the hay baled and into the barn , I stopped whatever I was doing every hour or so and went and fed the damned bird . On the third day , when the rush was over , I realized that the stack of baled hay had brought the nest from which the bird had fallen within reach of a ladder . I persuaded my husband to climb up and put him hack . When my husband climbed down , he reported that the bird had settled in beside his single nestmate with no fuss . That , I thought with relief , is that . Two more days passed . I crossed the threshold of the barn and chanced to glance down , and there on the concrete waiting for me was my damned bird . The sequence of events was as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bathroom ; the hourly duty grudgingly performed . This time , I knew I was stuck with him until he fledged , so I grudgingly gave him a name  --  Albert Ross , to be pronounced rapidly . Like most of us , I had read about imprinting and how by early experience birds learn to behave in a way appropriate to their species . It occurred to me that there was no use in saving this bird 's life if he grew up without knowing how to be a starling , and this he could hardly do shut up in a cardboard box in a silent bathroom . I made a nest of hay inside a bird cage , carried the cage to the barn , and hung it from a rafter  --  safe from the cats  --  so that the bird could see and hear the noisy comings and goings of the other starlings . I noticed that between feedings baby starlings , unless they are asleep , keep up a sort of whirring , purring sound , like a human baby crooning in its crib . I guessed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duty . My bird did it , too , of course . When I approached , I could tell by the intensity of the sound how hungry he was . When I kept him waiting too long , the crooning turned to a loud , eloquent , insistent whirr . I took Albert 's cage to the barn each morning and brought it into the bath-loom each night . During the day , I made five or six visits to feed him . When I walked into the barn , filled with the crooning of many little birds  --  a sound that seemed full of confidence that satisfaction would always come it struck me that the barn was a happy place . It had good vibes , as they used to say . I usually knew when it was feeding time without looking at my watch . This phase lasted about a week . By then , Albert was hopping restlessly around in his cage , and I realized that it was time to think about launching him . I called a biologist I know . I opened by saying that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nevertheless I would appreciate instructions on preparing him for release . The biologist said that first the bird should be allowed to flutter around some safe enclosure and practice flying . A screened porch would be ideal . I have a screened porch , so that was O.K. Then I should teach him to eat by himself instead of from my fingers . Then I should put him outdoors for trial flights , allowing him to return to the porch for reassurance and refuge when he wished . When he was ready , he would leave for good . I explained that Albert was hardly tame , since I had n't allowed him to be imprinted by me . I wondered if I should continue to be careful about this . " Don't-worry , " the biologist said . " They forget very quickly and go wild . " He also said I need n't apologize for raising a starling . " They 're great birds , " he said . " Good bug catchers , very smart , beautiful song . That 's why they were brought here in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teasingly , " I bet you love that bird . " This suggested to me an image of a sappy woman murmuring baby talk with each offering of dog food , so I said coldly that I found Albert " interesting " and that I was grateful for the advice . Now I had more contact with Al-bert . He soon flew around the screened porch competently , but he would eat only from my hand . He quickly . be-came very tame . He spent most of his time perched on a bamboo blind wait-ing for me . Whenever I appeared , he launched himself at me , to land , chirp-ing and begging , on my arm . I tried every strategy to get him to peck at food . I scattered it at his feet on a bench . I held it before his beak . I se-creted it . No dice . This went on for several days . I worried . I called the biologist , who said to let him go hungry all day and then put food before him . That day was hell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At twilight , he still had not pecked a single crumb , so I fed him and , with relief , watched him go contentedly to bed on a perch I had fixed for him in a sheltered corner . The next day , there was a partial break-through . I put down a big ashtray full of water . Albert hopped in and took a vigorous bath , during which he sipped some water . I felt like cheering . By now , I had had Albert about two weeps . He looked quite adult , but not like a starling . He was a soft-gray color , with a pale spot on his chest . His outline was graceful . He was a nice-looking bird . When I went out to the barn , I realized that his class had graduated . The barn was silent , but the lawn was busy- . Where the lawnmower had recently passed , I saw mother starlings working intently , followed by gray juveniles who seemed to watch the mother bird and emulate her movements as she probed the sod for grubs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Albert and I went outside . I put him on the ground , and , squatting down , scratched up the earth with a trowel . Albert watched , whirring insistently for food . A worm appeared . Quick as a flash , Albert seized it . I continued scrabbling , hopping to a new location when the previous one was exhausted . We found all sorts of insects : wireworms , grubs , beetles . Albert was enthusiastic . Finally , he was full , and flew to a tree . I felt relief that another hurdle was behind us , but when I returned to the porch Albert cried out and flew in with me . It was just as well . At that moment , one of my cats passed by Now we were on the homestretch , but new worries seized me . I was teaching Albert to find food by hunting on the ground , as a starling must , but I was unable to give the warning cry that would teach him to beware of predators . He was foolishly trusting of my dog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I could n't he with Albert every minute he was outside , and , besides , he needed to learn to do his own hunting . For two days , I shut up my cats and left Albert outdoors . It did n't work . In the first place , he did very little searching on his own . He spent most of his time in the tree by the porch door waiting for me to come out , so that we could search for food together . Every time I went out , he would fly down to the ground and hop along after me wherever I went . I usually responded by getting down on all fours and scrabbling through the grass with my fingers while Albert stood by to grab whatever little scurrying things I scared up ; then , when I left Albert , he always flew back to his perch in the tree . Inside the house , the cats were furious and frustrated . Maneuvering to get in or out without letting one of them escape was nerve-racking . They waited by the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all too easy to visualize what would happen if one should get out : my two weeks of hard labor going down the drain as Albert flew trustingly into the jaws of death . When nothing had changed by the evening of the third day , I knew that the impasse must be broken . I was under too much stress . " I 've got to get rid of the damned bird , " I told myself . I recalled that there is a bird sanctuary twenty miles from my house . I found that it had a phone number . I asked the man who answered if I could lay a partly fledged starling on him . He said he did n't know much about the job but was willing to try . I put Albert in his cage , covered it with a towel , and drove to the sanctuary . Even muffled by the towel , the bird 's voice was penetrating . Albert chirped all the way in apparent bewilderment and alarm . I said , " It 's going to he all right , Albert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I found the sanctuary headquarters and the caretaker , a friendly young man in jeans with a red beard , who had a degree in invertebrate biology . That was reassuring . He should at least he good at finding insects . I let Albert out of the cage and he sat on my arm . We both admired him . Then I got down on the grass and showed the young man how to rummage about so that Albert could find food . I told him that Albert liked a nice , deep bath . I told the young man that if he would just look after Albert for a few days , helping him to find food and learn his way around , the bird would probably go wild after that . I picked up the towel and cage , and left . As I drove out , I was reassured by the sight of the young man on all fours progressing slowly across the lawn with Albert hopping along beside him . During the silent drive home , I felt relief that anxiety over Albert 's safety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine solution . I looked forward to a leisurely drink , with no bird-nurturing duties to perform . A drink would cheer me up . Around noon the following day , I called the sanctuary . The young man said that when darkness came Albert had split . He had disappeared into the trees , and had n't been seen since . The young man said he was sorry and hoped the bird would he O.K. As soon as I hung up , I realized my mistake . At home , I had put Albert on the porch each night while the cats were let out . Naturally , at bedtime he had gone to look for his accustomed sleeping place . He had probably fluttered in confusion through the dark woods . At daylight , I imagined , he had started out again for home . He would probably stop at the first house he came to . If a person appeared , Albert would land at that startled person 's feet and beg . I prayed there would be no eats in the house that Albert found . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down Albert 's perch and picked up the food dishes and the ashtray bathtub . Outside , the lawn was dotted with starling parents guiding and instructing their young with an air of busy competence . They were a noisy bunch . Each time one of the young birds spoke in a voice like Albert 's , there was an involuntary response inside me . I wondered how long it takes for a person who has become imprinted by a bird to get over the illusion that she is its mother .
