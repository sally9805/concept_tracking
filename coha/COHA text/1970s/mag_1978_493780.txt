Anything but VAT Russell Long and Al Ullman have been publicly mulling over the possibility of a new federal tax . What the chairmen of Congress 's two principal tax-writing committees have in mind is called a value-added tax . Depending on who 's talking , it would partially replace the Social Security payroll tax ( Ullman 's version ) or totally replace it and , in addition , partially replace the personal income tax ( Long 's version ) . This is not the first serious discussion of a VAT . American policymakers occasionally have been tempted by it ever since 1967 , when the European Common Market required all member countries to implement a VAT to replace the property tax as a source of revenue for public schools , but the idea never got a strong push and eventually was discarded . In essence , a federal VAT would be a national sales tax , differing little in its effects from the retail sales taxes already imposed by most states . But in administration , a VAT would be considerably more complicated . The VAT applies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taxes . President Nixon proposed a VAT to goods and services at each stage of the production and sale process . lf , for example , during one month a retailer has net sales of $100,000 and purchases $80,000 worth of goods and services from other businesses , he is taxed on the $20,000 difference ? which represents the value he has added to the product . From the first stage of production to the final sale there may be dozens of transactions ; and at each step the VAT must be calculated , making it much more complex than a simple tax on the final retail sale , while raising exactly the same amount of revenue . AVAT would raise about $12 billion for each percentage point in the tax rate . It would serve as a more predictable source of funds than the income tax , since it would not be directly affected by the increases in unemployment and decreases in corporate profits that occur during recessions . It would encourage more saving , since it taxes only consumption , not income . It might improve the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tax on exports ( as the Common Market nations do ) , which can not be done with other taxes , like employers ' Social Security payments . For Long and Ullman , though , the VAT 's biggest attraction is political . Both instinctively know the truth of Burke 's lament : " To tax and to please , no more than to love and be wise , is not given to man . " But both also know that some taxes cause keener pain than others . Payroll taxes are highly visible : every paycheck confronts wage earners with the personal cost to them of running the federal government . Last year 's Social Security tax increase provoked noisy protest from taxpayers ? enough , in an election year , to only just miss forcing Congress to revoke it Long and Ullman no doubt are eyeing the even bigger Social Security increase scheduled for next year and dearly want to avoid another storm of public outrage . Their solution is the value-added tax , which in many cases would simply be included in the purchase price of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect , it would be pretty well unnoticed . Even if it were not invisible , the VAT would be less painful than a payroll tax . This is because it would take its share in nibbles ? a few pennies here , a few pennies there ? rather than in one big gulp every two weeks or so . The advantage to politicians lies in the fact that most people will have only the vaguest idea of how much money the tax costs them : it 's a rare taxpayer who would sit down every two weeks to add up the VAT she has paid . ( How manydo it today with the sales tax ? ) Senator Long exhibits surprising candor on this point ? the VAT is " the least painful way of collecting money , " he says ? probably because he knows the people he has to persuade are his fellow members of Congress . The battle for VAT will be waged in the committee rooms , not in the streets As a rule , visible , cumulative taxes are preferable to hidden , incremental ones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or should be ? that it is better for citizens to know what their government is doing to them than for them not to know . Making taxes less obvious will not improve the average taxpayers ' lot , it will just make it harder for them to identify the source of their troubles . Logically this would make Congress less sensitive to its constituents and less vulnerable to voter dissatisfaction . The VAT 's biggest flaw , though , is its regressive impact . Unlike the federal income tax , there is not even the pretense of charging higher rates to those who can afford a larger relative burden . In fact , like any sales tax , the VAT actually takes a larger proportion of poorer people 's income than it does richer people 's . This is because the poorer you are , the more of your income must go to pay for consumer goods ? food , shelter , transportation , clothing and so on . A VAT shifts the weight of taxation from those who can afford to save money to those who can not : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Long takes a sanguine view of this unfortunate result , arguing that a VAT would be no more regressive than the existing Social Security payroll tax . No doubt he is right here . Since it applies to only the first $17,700 of wage income ( higher next year ) , and not at all to investment profits , the FICA tax is one of the most regressive imaginable . The VAT is no worse , but saying so is no recommendation . Ullman thinks a VAT 's regressivity could easily be corrected by exempting certain basic goods like food . But doing so would not change the crucial fact that the tax will weigh lightest on the wealthy and heaviest on those below them . Providing such exemptions would only shift some of the burden from the poor to the middle class . Moreover , every exemption would diminish what Long and Ullman see as one of the VAT 's most appealing virtues : its alleged simplicity . They also would reduce the amount of revenue the tax would bring in As a matter of fact , the VAT is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because in Europe it replaced a hideously complicated system of business turnover taxes . The VAT may look simple by European standards , but it would be considerably more complex than either a national retail sales tax or the Social Security tax it is supposed to replace . It certainly is more complicated than the alternative that also would distribute the burden most fairly : simply raising the same mount of revenue through the income tax , a which is going to remain in any event . Long and Ullman are right that this sort of tax on consumption would encourage more savings , thus providing badly needed funds for investment . Personal saving in this country has fallen to the lowest level in 30 years . A low level of savings inhibits capital formation , thus slowing gains in productivity , thus aggravating inflation . For this reason and others , a progressive consumption tax is thought by many to be the fairest and most efficient possible tax system . But a VAT would be a quite minor stimulus to savings . The real enemy of saving is inflation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be tomorrow . Federal ceilings on the interest that can be paid on savings have made thrift a losing venture , even before the income tax comes along to reduce the return even further . If Long and Ullman really want to stimulate savings , they should repeal limits on interest rates and consider indexing Treasury bonds to the Consumer Price Index , to stop the government 's insidious habit of betting against itself . Most important , they should support long-range steps to bring down the rate of inflation . Enacting a VAT would be a drastic step , and Congress lately has shown little taste for anything drastic . But it may be the only alternative to facing head-on the anger of an already ornery taxpaying public that would be further aroused by a big boost in Social Security taxes . Lately Congress has not shown that kind of bravery , either . When the Social Security increases take effect , Congress will be looking for an easy way nut , and it might turn to a VAT . If so , the decision will be made on its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
