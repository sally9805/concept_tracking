If anyone ever had any doubts , Israel made it clear once again that it has no intention of returning all , or even most , of the Arab territory it seized in 1967 . In fact , suggestions that it do so , particularly when they are from friends , only make the Israelis dig in deeper . Last week the Israelis were upset by a U.S. proposal that Israel give back almost all of the territory in return for security provided by an international peace-keeping force . Despite efforts on both sides to keep their disagreement at a low key , the episode clearly showed that Washington and Jerusalem are far apart on the territory question-and that the distance is putting a growing strain on U.S.-Israeli relations . <P> The argument was starkly defined when Secretary of State William Rogers reiterated an earlier proposal that peace-keeping forces be stationed along an Egypt-Israel truce line that would incorporate only " insubstantial " changes from Israel 's 1967 borders . The proposed force would be under United Nations supervision and for the first time would include not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but those of the U.S. and , in a surprising suggestion , of the Soviet Union as well . This , said Rogers , was the way to keep peace in the Middle East . " In modern-day world situations , geography is not ordinarily important , " he said .

To be chastised by a friend like Rogers heightened the Israeli siege mentality . Premier Golda Meir , addressing a Labor Party Central Committee meeting , was so angry that she came close to diplomatic insult . " We can not rely on Rogers ' plan , " she said , " even if he does make it in good faith . " Other officials supported her with unanimity . " All the modern developments in military technology can not negate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yigal Allon . <P> Flying off to Washington , Foreign Minister Abba Eban pressed Israel 's arguments in meetings with Rogers and White House Adviser Henry Kissinger . Israel , Eban said , could " think of no device " to protect itself except secure borders . Moreover , it must negotiate them in its own way . If the price of such negotiation was estrangement , said Eban , then " a nation must sometimes be willing to live in a state of tenacious solitude . " At home , Defense Minister Moshe Dayan echoed Eban 's determination . " We shall be left with two different formulas , " he said , " an American one and an Israeli one , and the formulas will have to coexist . "
