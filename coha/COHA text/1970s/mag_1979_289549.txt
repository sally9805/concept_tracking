Like the children of Hamelin chasing the Pied Piper , investors last week continued rushing to put their paper money into hard goods . Gold scaled yet another peak on the London exchange : $397 per oz. , almost double a year ago . Prices soared for platinum and silver , and even copper that was 81 per Ib. two months ago sold for $1.05 per Ib . <P> The rush to tangibles , including art and antiques as well as metals , reflects the spreading distrust of nearly all currencies after a decade of high inflation . People would rather bank what wealth they have in commodities and collectibles with intrinsic value that they can see and feel . <P> The dollar was again the primary victim of this classic inflationary flight into goods . West Germany raised the value of its muscular mark by 2% against other European currencies to discourage speculators from dumping dollars to buy marks . But all it took was some news about the U.S. trade deficit to send the buck plunging sharply anyway . Most members of TIME 's Board of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as inflation in the U.S. remains steeper than in other leading industrial countries , says Economist Otto Eckstein , " the dollar is indefensible . " <P> At this week 's annual meeting in Belgrade of the finance ministers and central bankers of the 138-country International Monetary Fund , another step may be taken to dethrone the dollar as the world 's chief reserve currency , and replace it with a collection of monies that will give more economic and geopolitical power to hard-currency nations , including West Germany and Japan . In an attempt to remove from the money markets some of the excess dollars that provide cannon fodder for speculators , the IMF would replace as much as $40 billion with its own bonds . Now there are some $225 billion in dollars in foreign central bank vaults and $500 billion more in private hands outside the U.S. For a generation the dollar 's dominant currency role reflected U.S. global might ; its decline mirrors America 's shrunken role .                    @
