txt Behind the glitter and glow of a promised tax cut loom unanswered questions about the long-range effects of President Ford 's economic and energy package . Chief concern of analysts queried here centers on the inflationary impact of Mr. Ford 's plan to add $3 to the cost of a barrel of oil , both imported and domestic . This is " awful , " said Joseph A. Pechman , director of economic studies for the Brookings Institution . The added cost " will run right through the economy . " Form of return Mr. Ford hopes to funnel the $30 billion he says will be raised through new energy taxes back into the economy , " in the form , " the President told the nation , " of additional payments and credits to individuals , business , and state and local governments , " in 1975 and following years . Congress will be asked , White House press secretary Ron Nessen said Tuesday , to reduce individual income taxes permanently by $16.5 billion a year beginning in 1975 . These reductions will heavily favor lower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a family of four with adjusted gross income of $5,000 , which now pays $185 income tax , would pay zero under the President 's proposal . Tax of a similar-sized family earning $10,000 would fall from the present $810 to $518 . At the $15,000 level , taxes would go down from $1,699 to $1,478 . At $20,000 , the tax would fall from $2,660 to $2,450 . At $40,00 , it would go from $7,958 to $7,828 . The President 's plan , according to Mr. Nessen , would mean that an average family of four would pay no taxes on an income of $5,600 a year . The present starting point is $4,300 . In a surprisingly liberal move for a Republican president , Mr. Ford also proposes to provide cash // *Oil price spiral may cost $100 billion // payments ( totaling $2 billion a year ) to all those whose incomes are so low that they owe no taxes . This is , in essence , a negative income-tax plan , or a form of guaranteed income , often advanced in the past by liberal Democrats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , Mr. Ford 's plan would further aid business by cutting the corporate income tax rate from 48 to 42 percent at a cost to the Treasury of $6 billion a year . Brookings Institution economist Pechman believes that the $30 billion in extra oil levies will end up in much higher prices on a wide range of goods to consumers as the extra cost is passed along . Self-defeating possibilities Already officials , of public utilities , airlines , other transportation companies , and heating-oil dealers have warned that their higher costs will be passed through to consumers . John D. Wilson , senior vice-president and chief economist of the Chase Manhattan Bank , warns of a different danger from the projected oil levies . " We must be careful , " he said " that any increased tariff or taxes on energy are fully offset in the long run by future tax actions . " Otherwise they will be deflationary and self-defeating , as far as the economy is concerned , " he said . If , in other words , the effect of the planned levies is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may decline further . Mr. Ford 's expressed hope is that Americans , rather than pay higher prices for petroleum , will cut back on their driving and other oil consumption , to " meet our goal of reducing foreign oil imports by 1 million barrels a day by the end of this year and by 2 million barrels before the end of 1977 . " Tax rebate applauded Some economists warn that reduced oil consumption could , by itself , depress the economy , by lessening demand for cars and other goods and services directly linked to the use of oil . Mr. Ford receives generally high marks from experts for his proposal to pump , $16 billion back into the , economy through a one-shot 1974 tax rebate , though some economists believe the amount should be higher . " This , " said Alice M. Rivlin , senior fellow of the Brookings Institution , " is a fair enough way to get a quick stimulus to the economy . " Mrs. Rivlin referred to Mr. Ford 's plan to give all - taxpayers a 12 percent rebate on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plus a rebate to business taxpayers , including farmers . Twelve ' billion dollars would go to individuals and $4 billion to businessmen . Mr. Ford , who said he has " fought against deficits all my public life , " forecasts that his economic and energy proposals may produce a $30 billion federal budget deficit this year and $50 billion in 1976 . The size of these deficits deeply concerns Treasury Secretary William E. Simon , who warns of their inflationary impact in years to come . The President , who agrees that " deficits of this magnitude are wrong , " urges Congress to reform federal spending programs mandated by law , whose costs spiral up with inflation . Assuming Congress goes along with Mr. Ford 's detailed proposals , all Americans will enjoy a rebate on . their 1974 taxes , and most taxpayers will pay less tax in 1975 and succeeding years . To some extent these gains will be offset by higher gasoline and heating oil costs . Mr. Nessen said the White House expects the average family 's annual fuel costs would rise by $250 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oil .
