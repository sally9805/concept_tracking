Rarely has fear scored so total a victory over greed in the minds of investors as in the stock market of 1974 . As traders worried about virulent inflation and mounting evidence of recession , many common stocks dropped to prices not seen since the 1950s . Rallies were brief and whimsical , reflecting sporadic technical adjustments rather than any lasting return of investor confidence . The Dow Jones industrial average sank to two twelve-year lows in two months , most recently on Dec. 6 when it dropped to 578 . It closed last week at 593 , up 15 points for the week but still 31% below the start of the year and fully 459 points below its alltime high of 1,052 in January 1973 . <P> Partly because the past year was so bad , the outlook for 1975 is somewhat brighter . If nothing else , analysts say , stock prices have discounted just about all the bad news that can be realistically expected and are due for an upturn , perhaps by spring , that could gradually push the Dow to around 800 by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early 1964 ) . Their major reason : as the worsening recession bites into corporate profits and the rate of inflation , investors will sense that the economy is about to bottom out and will begin buying in advance of any real upturn . Stock traders usually do behave that way : share prices so often drop before a recession begins and then turn back up before a recovery starts that they are classed as a leading indicator of the economy . One factor , however , will serve to limit any rally : institutional investors , such as banks , pension funds and insurance companies , have become nearly as disillusioned with common stocks as individual investors . They may ride any rally to the point at which they recover recent stock losses , then sell some of their holdings in order to buy bonds and real estate . Their selling will tend to temper rallies , but any prediction is iffy at best , and heavily dependent on moves by the Administration and Congress to restore health to the ailing economy . <P> Even before the year began , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Pressured by the Arab oil embargo , swelling uneasiness over Watergate and the worsening specter of inflation , the Dow lost some 180 points in 60 days toward the end of 1973 . The widely followed indicator rose to its 1974 high of 892 in March , then began a perilous saw-toothed decline that seemed almost irreversible ( see chart ) . <P> The rally that everyone hoped would follow the Nixon resignation never came . High interest rates , long blamed for driving investors out of stocks and into such interest-bearing securities as bonds and Treasury bills , began easing in early fall , but stocks still went down . The week after the Ford Administration staged its televised economic summitry in September , investors showed their skepticism by pushing the Dow below 600 for the first time since 1962.
