Colonel Muammar Gaddafi , 29 , leader of Libya 's revolutionary government , is a compulsive orator who occasionally stumbles over his own rhetoric . He did so again last week before a clutch of visiting Arab notables and a crowd of 10,000 attending a celebration marking the second anniversary of Libya 's takeover of the former U.S. Wheelus Air Force Base outside Tripoli . Gaddafi scored the U.S. for racism and imperialism but thundered most harshly at Britain " because Britain handed Palestine over to the Jews and handed the Gulf islands to Iran " -a reference to three small islands in the Persian Gulf claimed by both Iran and Arab nations . He intended to retaliate where Britain herself was vulnerable . " There are arms , " he said , " and there is support for the revolutionaries of Ireland . " <P> Gaddafi 's high-flown statement angered the British , discomforted some Arabs and puzzled the Irish . The British and U.S. ambassadors to Tripoli walked out while he spoke . Next day Middle East newspapers suggested that in the battle against Israel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ireland , both branches of the Irish Republican Army insisted that they had received nothing . <P> The Marxist-oriented I.R.A . Official branch offered the unkindest rebuttal of all . When a Communist-backed revolt broke out in Sudan last year , one official remembered , Gaddafi captured some rebels as they passed through Libya and handed them over to Sudanese President Jaafar Numeiry for execution . That , said the I.R.A. , hardly qualified him as a fellow revolutionary .
