txt T. Conrad Monts is a young black businessman in a hurry . A former newspaper advertising salesman , he has been on his own only a year or so , but already he owns three Brooklyn dry-cleaning establishments purchased from former white proprietors . His target for 1975 : A dry-cleaning chain doing an annual volume of $10 million . But Mr. Monts is angered by the memory of his dealings with the Government 's Small Business Administration . Although it guaranteed a $65,000 bank loan to finance his initial two acquisitions , the Federal agency vetoed an additional $25,000 loan for replacing an out-of-date dry-cleaning machine . Soon the machine broke down , and Mr. Monts had to buy an expensive new automated machine . His cash sank to dangerously low levels . " We almost could n't make our payroll , " he recalls . In contrast to his annoyance with the SBA , Mr. Monts is pleased by the free-wheeling style of Pioneer Capital Corp. , a New York investment company founded last year by three Wall Street executives with the special objective of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buy his third dry-cleaning concern , he bypassed the SBA and got $20,000 from Pioneer in exchange for convertible debentures . The deal zipped through in a few weeks because , he says , Pioneer 's president , L. W. ( Bill ) Bergesch , " throws the numbers out the window . He knows that in the minority area you just ca n't operate like a bank . " Pioneer now is contemplating far bigger backing of Mr. Monts ' expansion plans . Helping Minorities Pioneer Capital is among the first of a new breed of financial organizations designed to speed help to small businesses owned by members of minority groups , from Negroes and Mexican-Americans to Eskimos and Aleuts . The newcomers are known as " minority enterprise small business investment companies , " or MESBICs for short . They 're closely akin to the small business investment companies ( SBICs ) that feed financial help mostly to whiteowned enterprises . The MESBICs are licensed and regulated by the SBA and get some of their funds from it ; Pioneer stretched its original capital of $250,000 with a long-term @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are privately controlled , they are not subject to all the laws and regulations that restrict the SBA . Partly for that reason , Nixon Administration officials are counting on a raft of anticipated new MESBICs to become a major source of aid to minority businessmen . " The SBA goes through agonizing appraisals , but a MESBIC can act , " asserts Arthur Singer , the SBA 's associate administrator for investment . Increasingly , Washington officials feel that minority companies often need more high-risk capital and specialized management advice than the SBA 's regular loans and other help can furnish . The MESBIC offers an ideal way to plug the gap , contends Commerce Secretary Maurice Stans , the Administration 's leading backer of minority investment companies . Major Companies Involved Thus far eight of the companies have been licensed . Among the sponsors are such solid corporate names as General Motors Corp. , Prudential Insurance Co. and Hartford National Corp. , a bank holding company . The management talents of such major enterprises , SBA men figure , will be most useful to the minority concerns they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to form MESBICs , and Commerce Department and SBA executives have pledges in hand from organizers of some 70 others . Among the MESBIC planners are numerous community development organizations and consortiums of businessmen formed by Chambers of Commerce . By the end of this year , officials confidently predict , 100 of the investment companies will be in business . The capital these 100 companies would furnish , a minimum of $15 million under SBA rules , could stimulate SBA and bank loans of far greater size . The total available to minority businesses might reach $225 million to $300 million , says Robert Sansone , a Stans aide . Ultimately , he predicts , some 200 MESBICs will generate $500 million in private and public funds for help to minority entrepreneurs . ' A Risky Business If experience to date is any guide , these dollars will go to finance a number of business ventures unusual for minority proprietors . Pioneer Capital here , in addition to Mr. Monts ' dry-cleaning venture , now has its money in a new magazine for Negro women , a computer software company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dress design and manufacturing companies . The SBICs ' experience has shown that white-owned small enterprises can be risky investments . " Add to that all the handicaps of being black or a member of some other minority , and we could wind up with losses as high as 30% or 40% , " says a Government man connected with the program . At this early date , there are no meaningful reports on the progress of the MESBIC projects . Among the small businesses being helped by MESBICs , the record thus far seems mixed . On the plus side , a California electronics company is snapping back smartly from a recent cash shortage that hindered production ; a MESBIC rescue operaton included both dollar help and management advice . On the minus side , a California grocery store closed down after a year of operation plagued by labor and inventory problems ; a MESBIC that backed it may lose about $50,000 . The sponsors seem quite willing to take their chances , in any case . There are signs that the average MESBIC will have well above the minimum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ General Foods , top management likes employes to take on after-hours community taskq , and a number have been counseling minority businessmen in New York 's Westchester County , where the corporate headquarters is located . Now the company views its contemplated MESBIC " as the focal point around which these volunteers can be organized to assure greater impact and higher probability of success , " says Al Lebau , assistant to the president . One MESBIC rescue operation considered a model is the aid rendered Reynolds Electronics , an East Palo Alto , Calif. , company owned by five black physicists and electronics engineers . Founded in January 1969 with an investment of $11,000 and an SBA-backed bank loan of $85,000 , Reynolds found itself last September with a $125,000 backlog of orders for its frequency synthesizer , a precision device used in certain test instruments and specialized radar units . It also found itself In a severe cash bind " because we had n't foreseen that of our original $S5,000 loan , we 'd have to spend $30,000 for factory test equipment , " says Vernon Reynolds , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want a visible demonstration of the viability of black business enterprise , you ca n't do it on a small scale , " insists Mr. Marshall . The relatively big payroll kept Amistad in the red even though sales were building , and when this year 's ecnnornie slowdown hit the company 's customers , its losses became critical . Moreover , operations have been hampered by high labor turnover ; during the pest 15 months , the company has hired 75 employes , of whom only 13 now are on its payroll . This situation partly reflects Mr. Marshall 's desire for a black work force . " If a black guy is 80% efficient compared with 95% for the other guy , we 'll take the black guy , " he says . With Amistad $38,000 behind on payments to suppliers and creditors , Arcata Investment has found it necessary to head up a relief party including individual investors , another MESBIC and a bank . The rescuers will provide the printing company with around $50,000 in new funds . Amistad is making some changes , too ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unsatisfactory and replaced them with two women  --  one of them white .
