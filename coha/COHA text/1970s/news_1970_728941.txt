txt The Department of Agriculture sharply reduced its estimate of the nation 's 1970 corn crop today because of the spread of the Southern corn leaf , blight . The result could be a rise in meat prices to consumers . In a special forecast ; the first issued in 23 years , the department said that the corn crop would be 4.185 billion bushels for the year . This forecast , made as of Sept. 23 , was 218 million bushels , or 5 per cent , below the estimate made by the department as of Sept. 1 and 635 million bushels , or 13 per cent , below the July 1 forecast . Clarence D. Palmby , Assistant Secretary of Agriculture , said after the report was issued that , despite the crop losses , the United States still possessed " ample supplies of all grains for animal feed and human consumption . " Mr. Palmby conceded , however , that the heavy corn losses could lead to early increases in meat prices . Rising grain prices , in turn , could cancel some relief in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result of increased chicken and hog production and the easing of restrictions on beef imports . Officials at the Agriculture Department said that the estimate had been revised because the rapid sweep of the leaf blight into the north-central region of the Corn Belt had not been anticipated . Portions of Illinois , Indiana , Michigan and Ohio  --  some of the nation 's most bountiful corn production states  --  were affected . If the latest forecast is correct , the 1970 corn crop would be the smallest since 1966 , 12 per cent below the record harvest of 1967 and 392 million bushels less than last year 's corn crop of 4.577 billion bushels . Except in the most heavily afflicted areas , the blight losses are not expected to be too heavy a blow to farmers . Expectation of a smaller crop this year has been driving the price of corn and other grain upward . Indeed , some Corn Belt farmers are reporting that their income per acre is going up this year even while their yield per acre is going down . The average yield of corn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , will be 72.2 bushels , against 83.9 bushels last year . Many farmers have been able to harvest their crops before the blight struck , slightly before full maturity but still in time to benefit from the higher price with nearly a full crop . The Shopper Will Pay The consumer , however , will probably pay in higher meat prices for the predicted reduction of the corn crop . This was the very part of the shopping list in which relief had been predicted for consumers . The number of hogs and chicken raised by American farmers was especially high this year , and it was expected that housewives would pay less , or at least no more , for ham , bacon or chicken dinners in the coming months . Now , with the corn losses and the resulting increase in grain prices , the cost of feedMe and fattening these animals will rise and so , probably , will the price of meat to the consumer . Beef prices should also go up . President Nixon easted restrictions on beef imports earlier this year , but whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canceled by rising grain prices . The corn leaf blight , a fungus that attacks the leaves of corn stalks , although known to exist in this country for a century , had been limited to the southern states until last year . Then a vicious mutant variety appeared that attacked corn cobs and stalks as well as leaves . Hybrid corn , previously able to resist the blight , was susceptible to the mutant strain . Borne by wind and water , spores of the mutant fungus have been swept up the valleys of the Mississippi and Ohio Rivers and attacked fields in the north central region of the corn belt . Wheat Referendum Set WASHINGTON , Oct. 2 ( AP ) ? The Secretary of Agriculture . Clifford M. Hardin , announced today plans to go ahead with a wheat referendum asking farmers to vote on an older , stand-by Federal program in case Congress does not act soon on new legislation . The vote is to be held by mail Oct. 12-15 among 6.6 million producers and others involved with the wheat crop . If Congress does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a House-Senate conference committee , or else extend the Oct. 15 deadline for the referendum , farmers will vote on mandatory wheat controls for 1971.
