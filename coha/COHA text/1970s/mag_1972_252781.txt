At five o'clock one morning last week , job seekers began lining up outside the offices of North American Rockwell 's Space Division in Downey , Calif . Within three hours after the employment office opened , more than 500 job applications had been submitted . What had brought them to the small industrial city was NASA 'S announcement that North American , the prime contractor on the Apollo program , had won a contract for $2.6 billion to develop the nation 's first space shuttle . This is one of the largest single contracts ever received by any company , and should help relieve the painful recession that has gripped Southern California 's aerospace industry since 1969 . North American will have to hire about 9,000 new workers within four years , 750 of them by October . <P> The space-shuttle vehicle , called an orbiter , looks like a puffed-up jet fighter , vaults into space on rockets and lands like a glider . Its first test flight is scheduled for 1976 . As designed , it can be reused several times and can ferry up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These stations will be used for astronomical and environmental earth surveys and will be launched in the late ' 70s . Next year NASA will also award contracts to companies for the shuttle 's cigar-shaped rockets and fuel tanks . In addition , North American will need the help of some 10,000 subcontractors to build an orbiter . All together , the contracts will be worth some $5.5 billion . <P> In the bidding , North American , Lockheed and McDonnell Douglas ' space division , all based in Southern California , had help from a well-financed lobbying team headed by Los Angeles Banker Robert Volk and California 's Lieut . Governor Ed Reinecke . They made several trips to Washington to persuade top Government officials , including former Attorney General John Mitchell , that a California company should win the contract . Beyond that , North American and its expected subcontracting partners-mainly IBM , Honeywell , American Airlines and General Electric-invested some $40 million to convince the space agency that they could build the best space shuttle . North American prepared a 16-volume , 4,000-page proposal , as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a week , up to 48 hours in a stretch ; the company had a rule that they had to quit by 6 p.m. on Sundays . After winning the contract , North American employees held a marathon champagne party . <P> The ultimate award not only set the stage for a new space venture but also revealed President Nixon 's commitment to revitalize the aerospace industry . If Nixon is reelected , he is likely to press hard to revive another project - the supersonic transport , or SST , which was shot down by Congress in March 1971.
