Europe 's top summer show at Paris ' Pompidou Center <P> By far the most important art show in Europe this summer is " Paris-Berlin , 1900-1933 " at the Pompidou Center in Paris . It is the second of three exhibitions designed to describe the links between Paris and three other capitals of modernist culture : New York , Berlin and Moscow . The project made a lame start with the Paris-New York show in 1977 , a patchy curatorial bungle . It finds its feet with this exhibition . The theme is large : nothing less than the whole panorama of the German avant-garde in its most spiritual , subversive or idealist aspects , from the time of Kaiser Wilhelm II to that of Adolf Hitler . It embraces film , photog- raphy , architecture , industrial design and printing , as well as sculpture and painting , and it covers an extraordinary ferment of ideas and images . In short , it is the first major exhibition-as the Pompidou Center proudly and rightly claims-to trace the development of the range of German culture in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ German visual art has traditionally been downplayed by a Francocentric version of art history , so that-especially for those born between 1930 and 1945- there were relatively few vivid images of a civilized " modernist " Germany to set against the overwhelming iconography of Nazi terror . Now this is changing . " Paris-Berlin " comes hard on the heels of a splendid group of exhibitions mounted in Berlin last fall by the Council of Europe under the general title " Trends of the ' 20s . " They focused on German Dada , on the Bauhaus and its circle , and on international constructivism . " Paris-Berlin " overlaps the earlier shows in those areas ; many of the " classics " of the ' 20s , like Laszlo Moholy-Nagy 's light-space modulators and constructivist paintings , or the ferocious social satires of George Grosz and Otto Dix , or the Dada visions of mechanized man by Raoul Hausmann and Hannah Hoch , are on view again in Paris . But the new show deepens the argument by paying more attention to the social and political aims of the German @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the outbreak of World War I. <P> It is , of course , a spectacle very different from French art . Instead of the relatively ordered conversations of the masters of the School of Paris , we see a kind of telephone exchange buzzing with impacted messages and manned , much of the time , by desperate operators ; among the shouts and static and discontinuous sentences there is a certain visionary urgency-a belief that art could act directly on the world-whose intensity had few parallels in art communities located to the west of the Rhine .
