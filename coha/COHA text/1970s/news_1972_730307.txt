txt Nothing so strongly arouses the collective national ire of Australians as film shots of kangaroos being hunted by professionals . The standard technique is what is known as spotlight shooting . The professional hunters normally operate at night using spotlight equipped four-wheel-drive vehicles and high-powered rifles with telescopic sights . It is difficult to measure how many kangaroos are killed each year by professional hunters , but in one state , Queensland , the annual bag is in the region of 1 million kangaroos . This is the state where the professional shooters are most active . Nader avoids the issue Agitation over the future of the kangaroo has spread overseas . Canadians and Swedes have been in the lead . And the concern seemed to have reached the United States when , on the eve of his departure for a recent five-day $20,000 lecture tour of Australia , conservationist Ralph Nader announced he would take up the kangaroo cause . But , surprisingly , Mr. Nader chose not to embroil himself in the issue when he arrived in Australia . Instead he stuck to his well-documented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standards and American standards , even though Australian car manufacture is dominated by the U.S. three ? General Motors , Ford , and Chrysler . His cautious approach on the kangaroo question was a reflection of the high emotional content of the issue and the low level of scientific knowledge ? at least knowledge of sufficient certainty to assert that in terms of conservation the kangaroo is in danger of extinction from hunting . // *Kangaroo concern mounts // There are a number of smaller species of kangaroo either threatened with extinction or thought to be extinct in Australia . These are listed in both the " Red Data Book " of the Survival Service Commission of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources , Geneva , Switzerland , and endangered-species legislation of the United States , Congress . Report issued As a recent report by a select committee of the Australian Parliament pointed out , none of these listed species is the subject of commercial utilization . The threat of extinction is raised not by the gun but by changes in the kangaroos ' habitat wrought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provided the one available publication on the kangaroo that sought to present the case for the preservationists and the conservationists ( two distinct groups ) , and the so-called industry groups ( consisting of sheep farmers , who consider the kangaroo to be a nuisance or vermin , and the professional shooters , who shoot 500,000 kangaroos a year for the local pet-food industry and export another 10 million lbs . of kangaroo meat ) . It is the absence of kangaroos in the wild close to settled areas that causes the most comment in Australia and generates the petitions to the politicians . Wildlife scientists are sceptical of this general statement . Kangaroos are not nocturnal in the sense that they can never be seen in the daytime . But partly in order to conserve body moisture , they do tend to remain under cover during the heat of day , feeding at dawn , in the late afternoon , and at night . One government scientist , R. Prince , told the parliamentary committee that if kanga roos can be seen commonly in daylight they are overabundant and represent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as another scientist , this time an academic , Prof. G. B. Sherman said , " If any of the scientists have told you that they are dealing with scientific facts in this whole confused kangaroo situation , they are wrong , because nobody knows the the facts . " The parliamentary committee that sifted through the evidence on the kangaroo presented to it was dominated by vocal conservationists . But the final report on the present state of the kangaroo in Australia was not condemnatory . It pointed out : " The kangaroo , as one of the emblems on the Australian coat of arms , and our best known form of wildlife , evokes an emotional response . " Consequently , the fact that this animal is slaughtered in large numbers for pet food is a moral issue for many people . " Even if it could be proved that with proper management kangaroos are a sustainable resource , many still would oppose killing kangaroos for profit . " By contrast , many pastoralists and graziers regard kangaroos as vermin that compete directly with stock for feed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The tourist industry in general regards wildlife , and particularly the kangaroo , as an extremely important attraction and wishes to see adequate numbers of kangaroos . " Wildlife scientists and state government fauna departments in their evidence generally agreed there is no basis for any claim that the larger species of kangaroos are under any threat of extinction , although in some specific areas overharvesting may have occurred .
