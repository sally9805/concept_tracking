work hard to get some variety in them . He obviously felt some lack because he has labored to compensate . He puts sarcastic organ music under the in ? vestiture of the puppet court . He shows the judges going to comfy lunch after disposing of their first three victims . He provides flashbacks of the happier days of two of the prisoners . Such devices would have been beneath him if he had been surer of the dynamics of his script . The actors are all excellent , notably Louis Seigner ( Alain Delon 's boss in Eclipse ) as the minister of justice and Michel Lonsdale ( of almost every second French ' film and some English ones ) as the minister of the interior . We also get a substantial look at Henri Serre , whom I have n't seen since he was Jim in Jules and Jim . If only they were all in a better script .

The When Fay Greener steps to the phone to " Dial Central " in The Day of the Locust , she enacts a ritual performed by thousands every afternoon between four and six for almost 50 years . Unfortunately for Fay , the operator informs her swiftly ( although not nearly so swiftly as a real one did ) that there was " No Work . " Founded in 1926 as a cooperative venture of all the major studios , the Central Casting Corpora ? tion is a shell of its former self in 1975 . And for a simple reason : there is no work .

Maybe Costa-Gavras ' film is more disturbing after one sees it than while it 's in progress . The same is not true , alas , of the new film by another French director con ? cerned with social question . Andre Cayatte , an ex-lawyer , made , among other pictures , We Are All Murderers ( 1952 ) , a cry against capital punishment which is the single most moving social-protest film I know .

For an extra was precisely that : human scenery . And the euphemism by which our superiors addressed us on the set ( only an extra had the right to refer to another extra as an extra ) ? " atmosphere , " " background action " ? emphasized this conscious reduction of individual human beings to scenic groups and clumps of things . In the earliest American films of this century 's first decade , the only humans to appear in a shot were the principals who performed the focal action . The only human presences in this crudely filmed universe were major presences . But then this was an era in which the walls and doors and building fronts ( and even the sky and mountains and trees ) were usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a three-dimensional space ? functional walls , windows , doors and buildings ; genuine trees , mountains , rivers and sky ? that serves as the medium for the enactment of genuine human events , other human beings also inhabit that same space , as much a part of a city street as sidewalks , buildings and automobiles . By 1911 , when American films had consciously begun to use that three-dimensional space as the proper cinematic setting for both interiors and exteriors , they had also begun to use much more three-dimensional scenery . One of D.W. Griffith 's innovations in texturing the reality of his Biograph films was to depict the diverse and independent life that was going on in the background of a shot as well as the principal action in the foreground . Griffith knew that , as Andre Bazin later stated , the cinema was a " window on the world . " When looking through such a window , the primary action of the shot could not be the only human activity in that physical world . That prominent activity was seemingly culled and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . While a train employee transfers the focal satchel of cash in Griffith 's The Lonedal Operator ( 1911 ) , other train employees in the background go about their business of loading and unloading freight . His Musketeers of Pig Alley ( 1912 ) literally teems with the street-life of New York 's lower East side that surrounds the principal players and events . By 1915 the concept of the extra was thoroughly and consciously un ? derstood throughout the film industry , for Griffith 's first wife , Linda Arvidson , explained that her husband deliberately used Negroes as " extra players " in The Birth of a Nation . What exactly was an extra ( as opposed to a " bit player , " " day player " or some kind of player with which extras were frequently confused ) ? An extra became much easier to define in 1929 with the birth-of the talkies . An extra was a movie actor who did not talk .

Articulate speech separated the in ? dividual human being from the piece of human scenery in a talking film , and if 26 such a silent existence seemed smaller and meaner than that of the speaking actors ( and it was ) , it was also steadier and more secure . The average member of the Screen Extras Guild earned 10 times the yearly wage of the average member of the Screen Actors Guild . Very few who worked as extras ever became principal actors or stars ( Marilyn Monroe and Julie Newmar were two of the more famous excep ? tions ) . And contrary to legend and cliche , very few extras had any hope or wish to be anything but a steadily working extra . How did you become an extra ? Theoretically , you did n't . Seeking a job at Central Casting plunged the applicant into a vicious Catch-22 circle : you could not be registered to work as an extra at Central Casting unless you were a member of the Screen Extras Guild ; and ( you guessed it ) you could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Central . In practice , you broke the circle if you knew someone ( University of Southern California footballers , like Mike and Marlin McKeever , and the children of workers in the film industry , like Keenan Wynn 's son , Ned , had no trouble ) . Or you could get lucky ( like the friend of mine who appeared at one of Central 's regular Wednesday interviews on the very day that they needed two dozen new 18-20 year-olds for Rally Round the Flag , Boys ! at Twentieth-Century Fox ) . You started " calling in " to Central at 3:45 each afternoon . And you called and you called . You spoke your name into the receiver ( no hello , no greeting , just your name , as Fay Greener did ) . The operator returned your terseness with one of three equally terse responses . The quickest and tersest , one was also the worst : " No Work . " The operator had seemingly perfected their method of barking this phrase with such rapidity that they reduced it to a monosyllable : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nerk " was both a noun and a verb ( as in , " Did you get a nerk today ? " or " Did you get nerked ? " ) . The second response came slower . The operator clicked off for awhile , then returned to say crisply : " Try Later . " This meant that someone somewhere would work the next day , but there were no casting directors free at the moment to make you that someone . So you hung up and did not try later . You tried immediately . Perhaps you got another " Try Later " ( and so tried immediately yet again ) . Or perhaps you got that third and wonderful response : " Hold On . " You held the line until a casting director clicked on to give you the next morning 's call . Not until you got your call or until the last nerk had been nerked were you free to do or think anything else .

And when you arrived on the set , the extra 's first thought was of money . For an extra worked under a very surprising and enterprising system . Our base salary ( $22.05 in 1958 , $47.50 in 1975 ) was for eight hours of " general extra work " ? for being a fairly neutral , fairly unin ? dividualized piece of human scenery . Extras liked to think that the base pay was simply for " making crosses " ? for walking back and forth miscellaneously in the background of a shot . But if you were needed for something special , if you were needed to be more individually human and less mis ? cellaneously scenic , you received ad ? justments to your base pay , as deter ? mined by individual bargaining between an extra and the first assistant director . The New Republic If you were to dance with a principal , or hand her a telegram , or riot in juvenile prison , or fight , or swim you could receive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extra 's argot as a " whammy " ) , equal to an additional one-third of a day 's pay . And there were double whammies , triple whammies , and , most desirable of all , a " Silent Bit " ( a very special piece of special business that was essential to the plot ) , equal to three times the base salary rate . Any overtime pay ( which the extra received as often as not ) was computed as a percentage of the adjusted day 's wage , not the base rate . So the extra 's daily wage usually averaged ( and still does ) some 40 percent more than the base wage . I received my financial education on my first day 's work . It was a late call ( about noon ) at MGM on a hot July day in 1958 . We were supposed to be floating survivors from some ship torpedoed by a U-Boat in some film whose title I never knew ( and still do n't ) . The studio handed us some old clothes and transported us by bus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " tank . " The wind machines blew , the wave machines churned ; we made one take and were excused . My experienced colleagues argued with the " A.D. " that we deserved special compen ? sation for this wet and dangerous work . ( I could n't understand what was dangerous , uncomfortable , or excep ? tional about a wade in a three-foot tank on a hot July afternoon for 30 minutes . ) The assistant director must have thought similarly , for he denied us any special compensation . And that was that . When the extra felt he had been cheated , his final recourse was an appeal to the Guild , which screened the footage and made a final binding evaluation . As often as not the Guild official agreed with the assistant director ( as he did for this shot ) . But later that summer , on Rally Round the Flag , Boys ! , we extras took a remarkable action when we felt short ? changed . We staged a wild-cat , sit-down strike , violating the industry 's Cardinal Rule : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ juvenile delin ? quent in the film , one of my constant incarnations for years ( presumably because I was so obviously " clean-cut , " including an H.R. Haldeman flat-top , and Hollywood even liked its hoods clean-cut ) . This allegedly comic disaster ( directed by Leo McCarey , no less ) culminated in a brawl between the local youth gangs and the garrison of soldiers who had invaded the tranquil New England town . At a Thanksgiving Day pageant , with the soldiers dressed as Pilgrims and the hoods as Indians , a violent riot destroys the festivities . Fire machines belched flames and smoke , apparently engulfing the tents and tepees , as we 50 Pilgrim-soldiers and Indian-hoods tussled , wrestled , thrashed and fell . At the end of the day , we assessed the value of our day 's work for the First A.D. : stunt pay . We argued that we had performed stunts that day ? violent fighting surrounded by dangerous fire . Stunt pay would not only have lifted our day 's wage to $100 , but would also have made us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Screen Actors Guild ) . A consequence of this shift of unions would have been that any future days ' work on the film ( expected to go another week ) would have to be at the same $100 rate , regardless of the action performed . The First A.D. , Jack Gertzman , was not about to pay 50 people $100 each for every remaining day of shooting . His offer : a double whammy ( double special business , or $35.05 for the day 's work ) . Came the dawn ? and the next day 's shooting . McCarey needed to shoot the brawl over again from a different angle . We wo n't do it , we said . It 's dangerous work with inadequate compensation ( and no extra is required to perform work he considers too dangerous ) . Ninety minutes later , Gertzman agreed that we were stunt men .

In one of that film 's monumental images , the evil Roman general punishes the rebellious slaves by lining the road to Rome with their crucified bodies . According to my colleagues , the going rate for crucifixion was $200 a day . It 's obvious that one reason the professional extra is virtually extinct is that he cost too much . Even in the 1950s , more and more production companies fled beyond the 300-mile radius ( the limit of the Screen Extras Guild 's realm ) , preferring to shoot in New York , where the Guild had no chapter or members , or in Europe , where none of the American craft unions could influence and elevate production costs . Today an atmospheric Texan played by an extra in Hollywood costs $47.50 a day ; an atmospheric Texan in Texas costs $16.80 . And that Texas Texan would n't know a whammy from a frisbee .

Just as the studio film represented a kind of purified and perfected ideal ? of human behavior , of human psychology and of human settings ? so too the human scenery in those films also represented a kind of ideal of those physical , social and geographical types ( like the Hollywood preference for the " clean-cut hood " ) . The new esthetic values in films that developed in the ' 60s favored the real and the authentic rather than the ideal . Shooting left the studios for real locations and real rooms in real houses in real places other than Hollywood . When the movies left the studios , they also left the extras behind . Those real locations had their own human scenery that authentically inhabited it ; Texans in Texas were not only less expensive human scenery than Central Casting could provide , but also much more genuinely atmospheric and flavorful human scenery . Just as the Hollywood studios ( like Universal ) that survive today do so primarily on television shooting , the extras who still survive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course . I got a start recently while watching Young Frankenstein when , in the scene in Dr. Frankenstein 's medical class , I suddenly found myself looking at the familiar faces of extras . Many of them were literally the same faces with whom I had worked 15 years earlier . We had sat together in high school with Tuesday Weld in Because They 're Young ; we had sat together with Tony Perkins in Tall Story ; we had been graduated together to college with Paula Prentiss and Connie Francis , in Where the Boys Are . Now they had made it to medical school . Perhaps Mel Brooks ' decision to use ordinary , old-style extras was a part of his film 's parodic conception , for those extras are as much a part of the dead movie past as the Frankenstein genre . Central Casting , with perhaps 12,000 registered extras two decades ago , now has less than 3000 . Only 1500 of those work with any regularity , and less than 500 make a living at it .

Twenty-five years after his death on November 2 , 1950 Bernard Shaw is very much alive . The cranky , witty non ? agenarian 's demise had come so close to the centenary of his birth ? a traditional time for revaluation ? that the usual posthumous period for eclipse and rehabilitation was almost nonexistent ; and visiting Shaw 's house at Ayot St Lawrence on behalf of the National Trust , to which G.B.S. willed it , Sir Harold Nicolson was dubious about the government 's accepting the unpreten ? tious former rectory . " I am not happy about it , " he noted in his diary . " I do not think that Shaw will be a great literary figure in 2000 A.D. He is an amazingly brilliant contemporary ; but not in the Thomas !
