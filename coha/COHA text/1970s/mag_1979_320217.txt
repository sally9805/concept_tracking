Heavy fighting , by both the army and the " Islamic guard , " whose loyalty is to the ruling clergy , raged in the Kurdish town of Saqqez as government forces tried to expel a band of 2,000 Kurdish rebels . Scattered skirmishes took place elsewhere in the region inhabited by 4 million Iranian Kurds , who for centuries have been seeking independence , or at least a measure of autonomy . After a tribunal ordered the execution of 36 Kurds for " counterrevolutionary crimes , " a Kurdish political leader , Karim Hessami , warned the government : " From now on , for every Kurd executed , we shall punish one of the Islamic guards in our captivity .

" We knew they were non-Islamic , but they proved to be nonhuman . " The Ayatullah also fumed at his appointed government 's failure to rule effectively .
