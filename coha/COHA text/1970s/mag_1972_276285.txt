Who was the first abstract artist ? <P> There are many claimants , from Picabia to the obscure Lithuanian Ciurlionis . But if one angles the question a little and asks who was the first painter to produce a major life 's work from systematic abstraction , there is only one answer : Wassily Kandinsky , who was born in Moscow more than a century ago , in 1866 , and died in France in 1944 . <P> " I really believe , " Kandinsky wrote toward the end of his life , " that I am the first and only artist to throw not just the ' subject ' out of my paintings , but every ' object ' as well . " <P> Thanks to the Guggenheim Museum , whose founder bought more than 100 Kandinskys during the 1930s , there has always been a special relationship between the artist and a city he never visited , New York . Next week a major Kandinsky retrospective opens at the Guggenheim , giving New Yorkers and others a further chance to assess this curious , prophetic and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ core of modernism his visions lay . <P> Influences . Kandinsky was a late starter . He painted nothing serious until he was 30 , and his seminal work hardly began until he had turned his 40th year . But the influences were already being laid down . A student of law and political economy at the University of Moscow , he visited rural Russia on an ethnological survey in 1889 and there saw a lot of folk art . Its rigid iconography and flamboyant patterns made a vast impression on him ; the ceremonious detail of his later abstractions , with their tiny squares , circles and triangles " tuning " each other like embroidery-as in Pink Sweet , No. 481 , 1929-is very Russian . Even Kandinsky 's subsequent color theory , his belief in the character and meaning of different colors and their use as a structured language , may well have stemmed from the symbolic use of color in Russian popular art . <P> When he decided to abandon his academic career and paint , Kandinsky moved to Munich and studied there .

What Kandinsky go from Art Nouveau was not so much its airy , sinuous quality as its decorative way of filling space : a painting like Landscape near Murnau , as late a ; 1909 , is full of references to the style with its slow , thick contour of white cloud , its carefully silhouetted forms ol green hill and pink road . <P> Secret Souls . Yet the crucial issue for Kandinsky was not style but vision There is something hallucinatory about the richness of Kandinsky 's stock of inner images . Of his way of seeing , he wrote that " everything ' dead ' trembled Not only the stars , moon , woods , flowers of which the poets sing , but also a cigarette butt lying in the ashtray , a patient white trouser button looking up from a puddle in the street , a submissive bit of bark that an ant drags through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important destinations .
