During a vacation two years ago at the popular Mediterranean beach of Tel Baruch , Israeli Professor Eugene Rosenberg discovered that no matter where he and his family went on the shore , their feet were continually blackened by globs of oil . Returning to Tel Aviv University , where he heads the microbiology department , Rosenberg angrily told an associate about the pollution . " It 's a disgrace , " he said . " Let 's clean up those beaches . " Since then , a university team under Rosenberg has developed a way of preserving not only beaches , but the oceans as well . The secret : oil-eating bugs . <P> With Biochemist David Gutnick , Rosenberg isolated a genus of bacteria called arthrobacter , which feast on crude oil , and then developed a particularly fast-multiplying new strain , which they named " RAG-1. " * Bred in salt water enriched with phosphorus and nitrogen compounds , the strain gobbles up the paraffin ( waxy ) content of crude oil , leaving only small droplets of dewaxed oil that break down quickly in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With their new strain , the Israeli scientists were able to begin an attack on the major direct cause of the world 's oil pollution , which , contrary to popular belief , is not accidental spillage or the breakup of supertankers like Torrey Canyon . Most of this pollution is actually caused by routine tanker operations . Before entering harbor to take on a new load of crude oil , sea water used as ballast on the return trip is flushed into the ocean ; it includes a small amount of crude oil ( usually about one-half of 1% of the tanker 's capacity ) left over from the previous load . In this manner , the world 's tanker fleets annually dump an estimated 1,000,000 tons of oil residue into the oceans . <P> No Slick . Going to the source of the problem , Rosenberg and Gutnick last winter boarded a 125,000-ton tanker to give RAG1 a practical test . Selecting two of the ship 's tanks , which were each filled with 100 tons of sea water , they poured 55 lbs . of nitrogen-containing urea and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compressors were used to bubble air into the tanks through a perforated hose , thus turning them into ideal " bacterial fermenters , " says Rosenberg . Then a flaskful of RAG1 bacteria was poured into one tank . Six and a half days later , the tanker discharged its ballast . The unbugged tank emitted an ugly black slick . But there was hardly any slick from the other tank ; the bacteria had multiplied and taken the polluting elements out of the oil .
