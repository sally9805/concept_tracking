Oversaturation is not a new term to either football or broadcasters . From almost the moment the game first appeared on the screen some critics have said there is too much football on television . The volume of those warnings has increased in the past few years , even though sponsors continue to up their purchases of high-priced football programing . This season there will be more than 1,000 hours of football telecasts , at a cost to broadcasters of more than $80 million for the rights fees alone . Numbers like these have brought some surprising new worriers to the fore , among them National Football League Broadcasting Coordinator Bob Cochran . " I am more concerned about too much football on television this year than I 've ever been before , " he says . // If football has overexposed itself the warning signs may be clear long before Super Bowl IX rolls around next January . ( One of the best things that could happen to TV pro football would be if that game resulted in some interesting numbers , such as a final score @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the viewer , feeling like an overused blocking dummy , turned off the final All-Bowl contest of last season . And now he faces a far sterner viewing test . To cite one example from the gridiron telethon , 19 games , pro and college , will be beamed from Nov. 23 through Dec. 2. // " This year certain cities will have five games on five different days of the week for a large part of the fall , " points out Chet Simmons , NBC-TV 's vice-president of Sports Operations . " On Sundays the NFL is available on NBC and CBS ; on Mondays ABC has the prime time NFL game ; on Wednesdays some cities have a WFL game involving a local team ; on Thursdays the national WFL game is on ; and on Saturdays the college games are on ABC . " // That 's not all . There will be more college doubleheaders ( four ) than ever before , as well as 15 from the pros . One-hour replays of Notre Dame games will again be a weekly feature in more than 100 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in cities with large black populations , such as Los Angeles , Chicago , Detroit , Washington , D.C. and New York . When highlight shows and pre-and post-game programs are added , some locales will be blitzed with 30 hours a week of football . // Is this too much ? Since 1970 NFL ratings for both NBC and CBS have been slipping , although not drastically . NBC dropped 3% from 1972 to 1973 and CBS fell 4% . NCAA college football lost 9% of its audience over the same period . However , not all indicators are negative . Ratings for Monday Night Football on ABC climbed 4% in the program 's third year to an average of more than 14 million homes each week , making it the network 's biggest moneymaker . A one-minute commercial on that game costs $100,000. // ABC is football 's biggest spender , putting up $30 million for telecasting rights compared to CBS ' $23 million and NBC 's $21 million . This season ABC already has plugged a college game into its Monday night schedule  --  Notre Dame- Georgia Tech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one bowl game on a Monday night . ABC also will broadcast an extra pro game this year as a result of its new $11.5 million contract with the NFL . The added starter will be between Dallas and Oakland on Saturday , Dec. 14 . The network will face its toughest challenge on Jan. 20 when it will attempt to lure fans into watching the Pro Bowl , that outdated , semi-All Star game which has phony rules and fewer top players each year . ABC kicked in $1.5 million for the half-contest , and it will be interesting to see what pressure the network can exert on the league to make the game a valid form of entertainment once more . // Last season 's controversial anti-blackout rule again will be responsible for putting more pro games on TV . Because of legislation requiring the televising of home games if the stadium is sold out 72 hours before kickoff , 114 games were shown locally around the country in 1973 , compared to only one ( the Super Bowl ) the season before . As this season begins , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home schedules . In the 17 other cities , fans will have to play it a game  --  or , more precisely , a Thursday  --  at a time to find if they will see the home team on television . They are Baltimore , Buffalo , Chicago , Cleveland , Dallas , Detroit , Houston , Kansas City , Los Angeles , Miami , New England , New Orleans , Oakland , San Diego , San Francisco , St. Louis and New York , for Giants ' games only . // The most notable change in coverage this year will probably be at CBS where  --  thank goodness  --  the viewer is going to see very little of those mindless bands wandering around at halftime tootling Age of Aquarius . Following the lead of ABC 's Monday night production which reruns important plays from the previous day 's games at halftime , CBS will show taped highlights of contests still in progress . Jack Whitaker will handle that aspect of the telecast from a studio in New York . // On Monday nights , ABC has added two cameras  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Don Meredith . Early reviews of Williamson 's work  --  to give him the best of if  --  have been mixed . Which is also the best word to describe the emotions of TV experts in and out of football when they consider the sport 's first 1,000-hour season .
