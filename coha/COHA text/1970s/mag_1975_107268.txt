Ordinarily , it is Bill North 's practice to pursue a rigidly anti-intellectual course when discussing the science of base stealing . As opposed to such theorists as Lou Brock and Fred Patek , who are prepared to expound on everything from meteorology to the physiognomy of lefthanders , the Oakland outfielder is of the " I just run like hell " school of thievery . Thus it was with some surprise that a recent interviewer on the subject heard North take umbrage over a matter of semantics . // " I do not steal bases , " said North , the 1974 American League stolen-base champion but second on his own team at present . " Reggie Jackson steals bases . That Kansas City catcher , Healy , steals bases . With them , it 's a surprise when they go down . With me , everybody in the ball park knows I 'll be running , so I 'm not stealing anything . I 'm taking something . " He paused and assumed an imperious posture . " I am a base-taker. " // North did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Don Hopkins did . And since Hopkins is the latest in a succession of Oakland " designated runners , " swift specialists whose only purpose in the game is to steal , there was even less surprise . // Actually , the crime rate in North 's division , the American League West , is so high this year that a base theft there is as commonplace as a mugging in Central Park . If the larceny continues at its current dizzying pace , three teams in the division  --  California , Oakland and Kansas City  --  will have stolen more than 200 bases by season 's end , and no team in baseball has had that many since 1918 , when base stealing was the name of the game . The six teams in the AL West have stolen nearly as many bases this season as the entire National League , which trots out such swifties as Brock , Joe Morgan , Cesar Cedeno and Davey Lopes . The Angels have stolen more than a hundred bases already , which projects to nearly 300 for the season , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Washington Senators . Their Mickey Rivers ( 38 steals ) and the Royals ' Amos Otis ( 29 ) are well ahead of the Cardinals ' Brock ( 25 ) , who set a major league record of 118 last year . The Royals ' Patek stole 16 straight bases this year before he was finally thrown out by Cleveland 's Alan Ashby on June 5 , and is now 17 for 18 . Four Angels and four A 's have stolen in double figures , and the A 's , in the opinion of their premier thieves , Claudell Washington , North and Campy Campaneris , have not yet begun to run . // " I should have about 30 by now , " says the 20-year-old Washington , who leads the team with 23 , " but we 're laying back and playing for the big inning . I 'll still probably get about 60. " // " Laying back , " the A 's are still second in pilfery to the Angels , whose concept of a big inning is a walk and three steals . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thefts as home runs and , as the Texas Rangers ' manager , Billy Martin , has observed with his usual perspicuity , " They could take batting practice in a hotel lobby and not break anything . " ( In support of this supposition , the Angels did take batting practice in a hotel lobby  --  with a Nerf ball  --  and did not break so much as a light bulb. ) // " We have such limited power that running is a necessity with us , " says Manager Dick Williams superfluously . " We have five men who run on their own . Anytime you give our team 90 feet we 'll take it . We 've scored men from first on a single . We 've sent men from first to third on a sacrifice . We 've had men score on steals of second when the catcher has thrown the ball away . I think we 're playing exciting baseball . " // The Angels are obliged to run to save their skins , but what of the other teams in their division which , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not by Angels but by demons ? // Kansas City 's magnificent Royals Stadium was transformed in newsprint last week to " Royal Raceway " in anticipation of the track meet between the home team and the visiting Angels . In previous games between the two , the Royals had stolen 19 times in 21 attempts and the Angels 12 in 16 . Otis had stolen 11 times against the Angels without being caught , including seven in two games , which tied a league record set 63 years ago by Eddie Collins . Otis never got out of the blocks in this rain-shortened two-game series , however , and there were only five bases stolen , two by the 6 ' 5 " , 210-pound Healy , two more by the Angels ' second-best stealer , Jerry Remy , and one by the nearly uncatchable Patek . None of the thefts particularly influenced the games , both of which were won by Kansas City . And yet there was a consistently high level of expectation among the spectators , a sensation more common when a home-run hitter is at bat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " popularized a decade or more ago when Maury Wills was running loose , are now common in cities where the greyhound base runners are off the leash . The fans are warming to the running game . // " Speed has become the dominating factor in other pro sports , " says Jack McKeon , the observant Kansas City manager . " Football is going after track men as wide receivers . Speed has become increasingly important in basketball . Hockey looks for the fast skaters . Speed has opened up all these other games and it 's opening up ours . Three , four , five years ago a ball club might have one guy who could run . Now it can have four or five . You 're getting faster guys in baseball and they 're changing the game . Speed eliminates a great deal of bunting , for example . You do n't bunt an Otis or a Patek over too often . Why give up an out when you 've got guys who can run like that ? There is also more emphasis on pitchers holding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never had to worry much about that part of the game , are hurting now . The younger guys , who 've pitched against running ball clubs in the minors , may have better moves to first than the veterans . " // It is generally conceded , even by pitchers , that bases are stolen on pitchers , not catchers , although Healy gallantly suggests that " we catchers would be kidding ourselves if we put all the blame on the pitchers . Sure it 's the pitcher 's fault if a runner gets a big jump , but sometimes a guy will steal without the jump and that 's our fault . " Holding the runner on is the second most important weapon a pitcher has against a known base thief . The first is keeping him off base by getting him out . // Some pitchers compensate for inadequate moves to first with what in Patek 's opinion amounts to the " balk move . " Patek studied under the learned Wills when both were with Pittsburgh seven years ago . He mastered his lessons well and is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nuances of pitching moves . A raised foot here , a dipped shoulder there , even a furrowed brow or the suggestion of a smile , will give the tiny Patek his stop-and-go signals , and knowing when to run is as important in base thievery as the big lead and raw speed . It distresses Patek , then , when pitchers cheat in the cat-and-mouse game and throw to first when they have clearly made a move toward home  --  a balk , he laments , that is rarely , if ever , called by umpires . But he can sympathize with his opponents on a detached philosophical level . " If I were a pitcher , " he admits , " I 'd do it , too . " // The advantage , in fact , seems to be with the runner , a circumstance that delights Patek 's whippetlike teammate , Otis . " All I have to do is run and slide , " says he . " The pitcher has to throw the ball , the catcher has to catch it and throw it and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " // Otis has stolen as many as 52 bases in a season . He had only 18 last year , the unhappy result , he feels , of a temporary delusion that he was a power hitter . He has dismissed such grandiose thoughts now and is running better than ever . He has had three games this season in which he has stolen three bases and one in which he has stolen four . He has been thrown out stealing only four times and picked off first twice in 35 attempts . Being picked off bothers him not at all ; the big lead he invariably wangles is worth the risk . Otis is particularly adept at recognizing the pitchout , a ruse in which the pitcher purposely throws high and wide to the plate so his catcher can throw quickly and unhindered by the batter on steal attempts . " They 've pitched out 22 times on me this year , " he says contentedly , " and I 've only gone once . The pitcher always speeds up his motion , so you can spot it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detection is the Royals ' Steve Busby , who at the tender age of 25 is considered by many to have the finest moves to all three bases of any pitcher . " The first thing the base runner will do is get his lead , " says Busby . " I will oblige him . I want to see how far he will go . Then I 'll throw over there to cut that lead down . The more you throw the less chance you will have of a pickoff , but it 's important to shorten that lead . If the runner is quick enough to keep his lead and still get back to first ahead of the throw , I 'll just have to concede him his jump . There is no defense against a good base runner with speed . " // The A 's had a world-class sprinter on their roster last year in Herb Washington , who was not all that good as a base runner . Nevertheless , Owner Charlie Finley and Manager Alvin Dark thought enough of the " designated runner " scheme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ season they had three such specialists , but Washington was finally released and Matt ( the Scat ) Alexander , who had stolen 10 bases in 11 attempts , was injured during batting practice . Hopkins , who can also play the outfield and hit a little , is the survivor . He has appeared in about two-thirds of the A 's games and has stolen 12 bases in 19 attempts , a percentage he hopes to improve upon as his knowledge of the pitchers increases . // Last Friday was a typically chilly night in the Oakland Coliseum as the A 's opened a four-game series with Kansas City . Hopkins spent the early innings doing laps around the A 's gold-carpeted clubhouse , awaiting his call . It came in the seventh when , with two outs and the A 's leading 3-1 , Designated Hitter Billy Williams walked . Hopkins debouched from the dugout to replace him . And though , as North would have it , everybody in the ball park knew he would be running , he set out on the second pitch and slid smartly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the record books it will be recorded as a steal . But as North and , by now , Hopkins know , it was not that at all . It was a " take , " the kind that is adding an exciting dimension to play this year and , in the bargain , giving the customers what can only be described as a real run for their money .
