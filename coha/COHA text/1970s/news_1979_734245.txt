txt It could have been a stiff and formal moment , and int stead it turned into a spontaneous and poignant one , charged with the symbolism of parting and farewell and the respect and sympathy of a ' younger man before the painful infirmity of old age . As they finished signing the second Soviet-American strategic arms limitation treaty , Jimmy Carter , 59-yearold ? President of the United States , clasped to his breast Leonid I. Brezhnev , 72-year-old leader of the Soviet Union , and they kissed on both cheeks at their last meeting in the Hofburg in Vienna . The gesture evoked cheers and applause from the hundreds of diplomats , delegation members , their spouses and journalists who gathered for the historic signing . Six years of negotiations had produced 70 pages of constricted , wary statistcs and prohibitions bound and sealed in red wax , yet there was drama in the signing . The last three days have been strenuous for Mr. Brezhnev , who was described by an Administration official as " making a valiant effort to represent his country " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toll . On Sunday , according to an American official participating in the summit meetings , Mr. Brezhnev 's speech was so slurred it was not understandable , and he appeared to doze or lapse into unconsciousness at times during the three hours of meetings . At no point in the three days of stunmit discussions , an American participant said , was Mr. Brezhnev capable of lively give-and-take with the American President . He read only from prepared position papers and then not always with full clarity , the official said . Yet , despite his infirmity , the delegation accompanying Mr. Brezhnev especidaily Konstantin U. Chernenko , who has emerged as Mr. Brezhnev 's chief of staff and personal aide ? clearly deferred to him as the man in charge . It was with the background of these strains that the Soviet Leader today entered the Redoutensaal , a white-paneled ballroom with seven chandeliers , just before the President , at 1:02 P.M. Rosalyn Carter was in the front row of the audience , as were the Austrian leaders , Chancellor Bruno Kreisky and President Rudolf Kirchschlager . Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the applause of those present , and Mr. Carter followed suit . Then both sat at a green baize table built 119 years ago for the State Council of the Austro-Hungarian Empire , and aides brought the finished texts ? bound in red for Mr. Brezhnev and blue for Mr. Carter ? to sign . The Soviet leader took 20 seconds to write the first of his four signatures . He appeared to be making one labored stroke of the pen at a time . Mr. Carter finished and waited with folded hands to exchange folders with Mr. Brezhnev and to make two more signatures . And so when he stood to exchange the signed copies of the treaty , Mr. Carter took Mr. Brezhnev 's right hand and clasped it with his left , and to the rising applause , the two men embraced . Mr. Brezhnev 's aides gently indicated that he was to speak . His words slow and slurred , he said that " in signing this treaty , we are helping to defend the most sacred right of every individual ? the right to live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carter 's longer remarks . " Here today , as we set very careful limits on our " power , Mr. Carter said , " we draw boundaries ' around our fears of one another . " But as the Russian translation was broadcast into the echoing hall , Mr. Brezhnev 's expression clouded , he fumbled with his left ear and seemed to try to rise from his chair to talk to Mr. Chernenko , who quickly summoned Mr. Brezhnev 's personal interpreter , Viktor M. Sukhodrev , apparently , to whisper the translation so that he could hear it better . fle closed his eyes as if in pain . Thirty-two of the most powerful officials of the United States and the Soviet Union , including three of the 13 full members of the Soviet Communist Party 's ruling Politburo , stood behind the two men , seated in silence at the table as the translation continued . When it was over , they stood , shook hands again and joined in the applause . Mr. Brezhnev shook hands with every member of the American delegation , while Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hands of his own colleagues .
