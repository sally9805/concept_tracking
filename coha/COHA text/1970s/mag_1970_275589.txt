ONLY last year it seemed to many Britons that their long-sought economic turn-around was finally at hand . The balance of payments showed a handsome surplus , foreign debts declined , and even the country 's laggard industrial productivity gave signs of recovery . The euphoria turned out to be shorter than an English summer . Britain is once again tumbling into one of the periodic economic crises that have made the country the chronic invalid of Europe . <P> The British have dubbed the current malady " stagflation " -a combination of stagnant consumer demand and almost runaway wage-price inflation . During the first quarter , the country 's real output actually fell by 1% ; retail prices have risen so far this year at a 7.7% annual rate . In one recent week , statisticians counted 286 increases in grocery prices . Telephone charges and railway fares are up , some London subway fares have doubled , and postage for a first-class letter will go up from 5d. to 7d. in January . The nationalized coal and gas industries have publicly warned that substantial rate increases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Secretary of State for Employment and Productivity , " is out of control . Until we can get it under control , the country will be heading for economic disaster . " <P> Militant Wildcats . The sharp rise in prices is exceeded only by wage demands unprecedented in scale , and by the militancy with which they are sought . Basic wage rates rose a steep 9.9% in the seven months from January to July , compared with 5.4% for all of 1969 . By one estimate , there has been a daily average of ten work stoppages so far this year among the companies that supply parts to Britain 's auto industry . Now a four-week wildcat strike by 5,000 metalworkers at GKN Sankey Ltd. , a major manufacturer of car parts , has halted automakers ' assembly lines and has put 35,000 other auto workers out of their jobs . The parts makers are holding out for a 43% raise . <P> British workers have spent more time on strike so far this year than in any similar period since 1947 . They have succeeded in winning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Incomes Board that is supposed to keep that from happening . London dockers tied up shipping for three weeks this summer , paralyzing the foreign trade from which Britain earns its living . They want a 7% basic wage increase , and as much as 45% more in minimum overtime pay . Miners , who got a 10% raise in October , are now pressing for a 33 ? % hike ; local government laborers are demanding a raise of at least 20% on top of an increase last fall . Some 350,000 farm workers want a 37% boost and 320,000 teachers , who won an average 11% increase after a 3-month strike last winter , are after another 37% . Even 5,000 unionized steel executives are demanding raises of 18% . <P> The new surge of inflation is rapidly eroding the balance of payments gains brought about by two years of severe economic restraint . It has again called into question Britain 's capacity to compete in an enlarged Common Market and poses a renewed-though not immediate-threat of another devaluation of the pound . To avert that blow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will have to adopt strong anti-inflation measures soon .
