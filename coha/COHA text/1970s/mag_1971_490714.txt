THE SPORTING SCENE WHEN most people think of sport in Ireland , the first things that come to mind are the wonderful horses raised in the Curragh and the national exuberance for horse racing , and , after that , the excellent salmon fishing in the southwest and the Irish fondness for two native games that are played practically nowhere else  --  Gaelic football , which is a combination of soccer and Rugby , and hurling , which is a combination of field hockey and a special Celtic brand of karate . Since scarcely anyone associates the Irish with golf , it almost invariably comes as a surprise to the sports-minded to learn that the island is one of the great golfing lands  --  and , indeed , has more authentic golf courses per inhabitant than any other country in the world except Scotland , the cradle of the game . Where golf is concerned , it should be noted , Ireland is divided by no political boundary line ; the Golfing Union of Ireland governs the game both in the Republic of Ireland , or Eire , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a part of the United Kingdom . At the present time , there THE GREENS OF IRELAND  --  I are two hundred and twenty-eight golf courses in the two countries , and since the combined population is around four million three hundred thousand , this works out to one course for every nineteen thousand inhabitants . In the United States , despite the proliferation of new courses in recent years , the ratio is one for every twenty thousand people , and in Japan , to name another notoriously golf-struck nation , it is one for every hundred and seventy-five thousand . ( Australia claims to have about the same ratio as Scotland  --  one course for every eleven thousand people  --  but this is a highly asteriskable statistic , since the majority of the courses in Australia are little more than village fields punctuated with sand greens . ) In Ireland , the courses are not only numerous but of an exceptionally high quality . Most well-travelled golf experts , if asked to select the twelve finest courses in the world , would surely include at least one in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Like the famous courses in Scotland , the best ones in Ireland are situated on the dung linksland deposited centuries ago by the retreating ocean . While the thought of Irish linksland ( as opposed to meadowland ) may he startling , it really should n't be , because the coastal stretches of Scotland and Ireland are remarkably similar . ( Less than fourteen miles of water separates Torr Head , in Northern Ireland , from the Mull of Kintyre , in Scotland . ) In the last twenty-five years , the Irish have taken to their splendid seaside links and to their satisfactory , if less testing , inland courses with a tremendous rush . Whereas there were only twenty-five thousand golfers on the island at the close of the Second World War , there are three times that number today . All the clubs are filled to the brim with members , and an estimated ten thousand applicants are at present on various waiting lists , ready to spring forward whenever a vacancy occurs . In the meantime , since Ireland has no municipal courses , this frustrated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than a hundred pitch-andputt courses that have popped up all over the countryside in response to the demand for golf facilities , however abbreviated . In short , unlikely as it may seem when one recalls the historic Hibernian predilection for strenuous pastimes , golf has now become Ireland 's most popular participant sport . One of the primary reasons the game has found such high favor among the Irish is its inexpensiveness . Portmarnock , which is just outside Dublin , is generally accepted as the island 's premier golf club , but its members are required to pay an entrance fee that amounts to ( ) nit , a hundred and twenty-five dollars . Annual dues come to approximately that same mild figure . Moreover , the dues at the average Irish golf club are a V good deal lower than the dues at Portmarnock , which reflects the comparatively high cost of everything in and around the Republic 's capital city . For instance , at the Lahinch Golf Club , in County Clare  --  a first-rate course where the South of Ireland Amateur Championship is held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is no entrance fee at all , at all . Such modest rates are possible because the cost of maintaining a course is extremely low and , concomitantly , the revenue from the club bar can be depended on to he quite robust In any event , nearly ever ) Irishman who wants to play golf can afford to , and its addicts therefore constitute an almost complete cross-section of the Irish socioeconomic strata . Another fundamental reason for the Irish golfing boom is that the game is beautifully suited to the native temperament and character . A County Sligo man once explained it to me this way : " If a golfer so chooses , he can groove a tight little swing and plod around hitting safe little shots down the fairway . But that is n't how the typical Irish golfer approaches the game . He sees in golf a heaven-sent opportunity to perform spectacular deeds  --  bash his drives farther than mortal man has ever done before , or come slashing out of a briar patch with a phenomenal recovery shot that prostrates his opponent . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfect for a people like us , who admire feats of individual bravely and derring-do . There they are , within the reach of the most ordinary man . " It follows , I think , that the considerable success that Irish golfers have enjoyed in international tournaments over the past twenty-five years has had more than a little to do with the huge advances the game has made there . Until 1946 , no Irish golfer had ever won an important international amateur or professional championship , but that year James Bruen , a prodigious hitter from Cork , broke through in the British Amateur . Three years later , Max McCready , an Irishman living in England , won the same championship , and in 1953 it went to Joe Carr , a young golfer from Dublin , whose father had been a steward at Portmarnock . A model athlete , as cheery in defeat as in victory , Carr took the British Amateur twice again , in 1958 and 1960 , and more recently , in recognition of his exceptional record and his personal substance , he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ named captain the British Eisenhower Trophy learn and the British Walker Cup team . ( " Technically , these teams represent both Great Britain and Ireland . ) Irish professionals also made their mark during this period . In 1947 , Fred Daly , from Portrush , in Northern Ireland , won the British ( . ) pen and also the first of three titles in the British Match Play Championship . In the early fifdes , when Daly 's star began to fade , two professionals from the Republic  --  Harry Bradshaw and Christy O'Connor  --  took over , scoring notable victories on the British tournament circuit and winning places on British Ryder Cup teams . Though neither Bradshaw nor O'Connor managed to capture the British Open , together they brought off perhaps the most glorious of all Irish golfing triumphs when , in 1958 , they won the World Cup ( then known as the Canada Cup ) , in Mexico City , defeating a field of more than thirty two-man teams , which included the top players from the United States , Australia , England , Scotland , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game . The news of Bradshaw and O'Connor 's exploit was celebrated with champagne parties and informal parades down the streets of Dublin , and when the two heroes arlived home they were wined and dined for weeks . The World Cup match is held in a different country each year , and its sponsors , appreciating the frenetic pride that the Irish , golfers and nongolfers alike , took in their compatriots ' victory , scheduled the event for Portmarnock in 1960 . In 1949 , Portmarnock had been the venue of the British Amateur , and in 1951 the Royal Portrush Golf Club , in County Antrim , Northern Ireland , had been the venue of the British Open , but it was the 1960 World Cup match that clearly marked the coming of age of Irish golf . During the four days of play , sixty thousand keyed-up spectators  --  a record attendance for the competition  --  converged on Portmarnock to troop after such illustrious champions as Sant Snead , Arnold Palmer , Peter Thomson , Bobby Locke , and Gary Player , and to root for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substituting for the ailing Bradshaw . O'Connor and Drew eventually finished fourth  --  a commendable performance . Perhaps it was a good thing that they came no closer to winning , for late in the afternoon of the final round , when all that remained to he decided was whether Snead could overtake Flory Van Donck , of Belgium , in their battle for the individual prize , the excited gallery broke through the restraining ropes , the better to watch Snead 's progress , and roared down the last two fairways like a tidal wave , sweeping over hillocks and through hunkers . As one who was caught in the wild foam , I have often wondered what it would have been like if the Irish team had enjoyable one he assured me when we met early in the afternoon of my arrival in Dublin . " You 'll have no trouble . I 've phoned the people at the ; different clubs . Everything 's fixed up , I 've arranged for you to do your jaunt in two loops . First , you do a loop up north @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Port-rush the day after tomorrow , - Vednesday . On Thursday , you return to Dublin . We 'll have dinner that night and I 'll brief you on the southwestern loop . That 's all set up , too  --  Lahinch on Friday , Killarney on Saturday , Bally-bunion on Sunday , and back to Dublin en Monday . " MacWeeney handed me some papers relating to an automobile he had hired for me from Ryan Self-Drive , Ltd. , and , along with these , a ' t neatly written list of the secretaries and captains of the different clubs , the phone numbers of the clubs , and my estimated time of arrival at each of them . " You could string your trip out longer , " MacWeeney continued , with a smile that was both sanguine and cautionary , " but I 'd advise against it . The hospitality at our golf clubs can he pretty formidable . About three years ago , I spent a fortnight myself gathering material for a series of pieces on fifteen or sixteen courses in the west and the south @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Dublin would he more accurate  --  it took me three weeks to recover , for a fact . You 're wisest not to string it out . " Later that day , MaclAreeney drove me out to Portmarnock , after we had taken a quick look at Phoenix Park , an enormous tract on the western rim of the city . The park has a special significance for golfers , because it was there that golf was first played in Ireland , and MaeWeeney wanted to point out the site of that first course ? long vanished  --  which a homesick Scottish regiment had built around 1850 . This was the course that during the height of " the troubles " of 1887 Arthur Balfour , then Chief Secretary for Ireland , insisted on playing -- accompanied , necessarily , by a bodyguard of detectives . In those days , it was a rare thing for a public figure to be so smitten with golf , and though Balfour 's conspicuous love of the game did nothing to heal the centuries-old breach between Ireland and England , it gave golf a colossal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were seventy-three golf courses in Scotland , fifty-seven in England , two in Wales , and six in Ireland  --  most of these in the north . ) Two years after this , the members of the golf club in Phoenix Park closed that course and moved first to Sutton , on Dublin Bay , and then , in 1892 , to a lovely strip of bayside land at Dolly-mount , three and a half miles north of the city , where their club , the Royal Dublin , still stands . We drove past it on our way to Portmarnock , which lies some six miles farther to the north , athwart a tiny peninsula shaped like Florida . Portmarnock was " discovered " in 1893 by W. C. Pickeman and George Ross , two Dublin golfers , who had a feeling that the land would be perfect for the growing game . At this dine , the peninsula , the home of small farmers and fishermen , was a virtually sealed-off community , with its own brick plant and its own distillery . The land that was not farmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there the Portmarnock Golf Club was established in 1894 . Soon afterward , the little community on the peninsula began to disappear , for the club , as it acquired more and more property , chopped the bracken hack and pushed its fairways to the edges of the water . To reach the course in those early days , the golfers crossed Portmarnock Inlet , which is about half a mile wide , by boat or , at low tide , by horse and carriage . Today , a paved road leads around the northern end of the inlet to the clubhouse , a low white stucco building with an orange slate roof , which was erected in 1905 and has been remodelled periodically over the years . Except for the presence of the clubhouse , a visiting golfer 's first sight of the heaving green land across the inlet can not be much different today from what it was for Po rt ma rnoc k 's pioneers ? ? ? and there arc few invitations in golf as beckoning . The course , as you would expect , has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the improvements have introduced a note of artificiality . The chief credit for this belongs to H. M. ( Guppy ) Cairnes , an outstanding Portmarnock golfer , who between 1900 and 1930 took it upon himself to lengthen and revise the original holes to suit the changing game , and who succeeded so well that only minor revisions have since been necessary . Far more talented than most amateur architects , Cairnes laid out his holes so that they ran to all the points of the compass , and he routed his fairways adroitly through the sand hills so that there would he a minimum of blind shots . lie installed new hunkers , which looked hardly less natural than the ones nature had provided , and though he placed several of his new greens at sites where the land rose or tilted sharply , he saw to it that a well-played approach shot would seldom be penalized by a freak bounce . When experienced golfers speak about Portmarnock , they invariably mention its " fairness . " Of the classic British links , only Mssirficld , perhaps , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the south shore of the Firth of Forth , occupies far less rugged terrain . From the back tees , Portmarnock today measures 7,093 yards and has a par of 71 . It has yielded several 64s , but old hands at Portmarnock insist that the most inspired round ever played over it was a 74 by George Duncan on the final day of the 1927 Irish Open . A furious gale was sweeping over the links , and Duncan 's 74 enabled him to make up seventeen strokes on the third-round leader , who brought in a 91 ; nearly all the other scores were in the 90s . The story has it that Duncan played his historic round swathed from neck to toe in brown wrapping paper , to keep out the biting wind . At present , Portmarnock has around four hundred regular members and , counting the " five-day members " ( who can not play on the weekends ) , " coun-try members " ( who must reside sev-enty-five miles or more from the club ) , junior members , and overseas mem-bers , a total @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most truly national of the Irish clubs , for it serves golfers from all over the island , and particularly from the Republic , as a second club , much the way the Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St. Andrews serves as a second club For British golfers . Portmarnock , be-cause it is comfortably close to Dublin , also draws an ex-traordinarily high number of foreign golfers- more than f " fifteen thousand last year . The sagacious tourist usually manages to work in a lesson with Harry Bradshaw , the Portmarnock professional . Bradshaw , who has apparently never talked economics with Snead , sometimes charges less than a pound , but never more , for a forty-five-minute lesson . His fee for an eighteen-hole playing lesson is a pound . There is no better bargain in golf . On the evening MacWeeney and I called in , Bradshaw joined us in the bar , where we were talking with Rex Bock , the secretary . Bradshaw looks nothing at all like the standard modern golf professional . Now well into his fifties , he has the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ring Mixie first thing tomorrow and set it up . " He paused for a moment . " You must he sure and pace yourself carefully , " he resumed . " You 'll have a lot of driving to do , and , as I told you earlier , the hospitality can be fierce . " IRELAND  --  north and south together  --  is a rather small place , about the- size of the state of Maine . Travelling around it by car , however , takes appreciably longer than a visitor expects it to , even in times of peace , which then prevailed . The roads are in fairly good shape , but as a rule they are only two lanes wide and offer few straightaway stretches , so if you get stuck behind a line of lorries your progress can he pretty poky . In any event , it took me over three and a half hours to do the hundred miles between Dublin and Newcastle  --  a seaside town , thirty miles below Belfast , that was once a fishing village and is now a popular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grimness of the customs officials on both sides of the border , which the Dublin-Belfast road crosses halfway between the towns of Dundalk and Newry . As the Republic if Ireland man was checking my car-rental documents , I handed him one additional paper that the Ryan auto people had given me . " No , that 's not for us , " he said matter-of-factly . He then added , with a touch of asperity. , " That 's for Her Majesty up the road . " Moments later , when I presented the documents to his Northern Ireland counterpart , I said , " Good morning " ? standard procedure in the greeting-conscious Republic . The man said , " Take them to the second door , " indicating the small customs house , and I knew then that I was in a slightly different country . North of the border , both the towns and the rural stretches seemed a shade more ordered , and in its general appearance , as MacWeeney had said it would , Ulster reminded me of Scotland . The area around Newcastle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mourne , a chain of gentle green hills , slope down to the Irish Sea  --  or , to he more specific , to Dun-drum Bay . They have been celebrated in song , and for good reason . Indeed , I wonder whether the links at Newcastle County Down , for all their golfing worth , would have attracted as many championships as they have if it were n't for the lovely backdrop of mountains . The Irish Amateur has been held there six times , and the Irish Ladies ' Amateur nine times . The club has never been host to the British Open , but last year the British Amateur was played there . The British Ladies ' Amateur has been played there seven times , and in 1968 the Curtis Cup , a biennial match between British and American women amateurs , was contested there . The most remarkable day 's golf in the long history of Newcastle County Down occurred in 1921 , when , in the thirty-six-hole final of the Irish Open Amateur , Jack McLean , of Scotland , defeated Eric Fiddian , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fiddian made two holes in one  --  the only time such a feat has been pulled off in a national tournament . Fiddian aced the 137-yard seventh hole in the morning and the 216-yard fourteenth in the afternoon . The officers of the club , with typical Gaelic logic , thereupon presented Fiddian with a large color photograph of the ninth hole . Although Newcastle County Down is what most people call the course  --  to set it apart from courses at sundry other Newcastles  --  its correct name is the Royal County Down Golf Club . It has been a royal club since 1908 , when King Edward VII agreed to become its patron , but it was founded eighteen years earlier . The moving spirits were a group of Belfast men who liked the idea of playing weekend golf on real seaside terrain , which Newcastle offered . Old Tom Morris , the revered St. Andrews professional and one of the most sought-after golf architects of that period , laid out the original nine holes and outlined his suggestions for a second nine , which were built the following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receive a fee " not to exceed four pounds , " so , regardless of how much farther money went in those days , it is to be hoped that he had the presence of mind to turn in at least a skeletal expense account . County Down 's original eighteen holes , like most layouts of that vintage , were soon modified by local hands at every club there is always a member or two , he he credit manager or poet , who would rather be a golf architect than anything else in the world  --  and by 1897 the revised course extended to 5,490 yards . just a few years later , however , the modern , more resilient , rubber-cored golf ball replaced the old solid-guttapercha ball , and longer holes were needed to accommodate it . Here Coonty Down was extremely fortunate , for George Combe , the member who supervised the necessary changes , possessed uncommon golf knowledge ; the holes he devised were not only long and stiff but marvellously interesting . In the mid-nineteen-twenties , the club was fortunate again , for C. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was called . Harden , who went on to become chairman of the Joint Advisory Council of the British Golf Unions , stayed on at County Down for six years , during which he superintended many sensible alterations and brought the condition of the turf and the course in general to an exceptionally high level . Both Comfit and Harden , like . Cairnes of Portmarnock , had the intelligence to leave the physiognomy of the links essentially as it was . As a result , the fascination of County Down lies in its pristine naturalness . Much wilder in its over-all character than Portmarnock , it is a froth of spectacular sand hills rising thirty or forty feet above the narrow , winding fairways . Once a golfer enters this wonderland , he is entirely cut off from the outside world , and as the moody grandeur of the links envelops him further lie is transported back many decades in time , to the era of Old Tom Morris . One gets used to everything , so it 's unlikely that the members of County Down find the course the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the club has four hundred and forty regular and associated members  --  a figure that does not include either the members of the Mourne Golf Club , established at County Down in 1947 for the workingmen of the town of Newcastle , or the members of the Ro3 al County Down Ladies ' Golf Club , a separate organization , which pays an annual fee for the use of the links . On weekends , when the Mourne golfers and the ladies are not permitted to play the championship course , they get their rounds in on a second eighteen-hole Course that County Down operates ; this is a much shorter , quieter layout , farther inland . The Mourne Golf Club maintains a small clubhouse not far from the main one . The ladies maintain another , and they can almost always be found there , for a regulation that was propounded by the members of County Down in 1894 , when the ladies formed their offshoot , still prohibits a woman from entering the . main clubhouse unless she is accompanied by a man . To Americans , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only on equal footing with the men but usually in roaring command , this setup seems an anachronism , but it is fairly standard both in the British Isles and on the Continent . There , with few exceptions , the golf club remains primarily , if not exclusively , a male sanctuary . Most of the time , too , the clubhouse is a much more modest edifice than the adaptations of Mount Vernon or Chenonccaux at which the devotees of American country-club life forgather . For example , County Down 's original clubhouse , which is still in use , is a gaunt Victorian structure that seems infinitely older than its seventy-five years . A sizable addition has recently been finished , and this is an excellent thing . I am thinking particularly of the old locker room , which , like many such rooms in Britain , is a dark and fusty cavern , in whose depths I would n't have been surprised to come upon Old ' Corn Morris changing out of his hobnailed golf shoes . The club secretary , Arthur Jones , made my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Second World War , the secretaries at most of the leading golf clubs in the United Kingdom were retired military men  --  fussy old boys who , in spirit , had never left the plains of Lucknow . Some of them are still around , but nowadays they are decidedly in the minority . Arthur Jones is typical of the hospitable , relaxed new breed , although he has a military background . A Gloucestershire man who was a squadron leader in the Royal Air Force during the Second World War , Tones got his first taste of golf ad minist ra6 during the occupation of Germany , when he was assigned to run the R.A.F. golf club at Briiggen . He liked the work , and , upon his retirement from the service , in 1957 , became the secretary at County Down . Before I went out onto the course to bring it to its knees , Jones and I met in the club bar . ( It was early afternoon , and the bar was deserted ; in fact , the only interruptinn was provided by an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Casting , who came in to check with the bartender on how the new stout-dispensing machine was behaving . ) Jones became as nearly rhapsodic as a calm man can when he talked about the course : the rambunctiousness of the terrain , the fineness of the fairway turf , the trueness of the greens . " I 'm afraid , though , that you wo n't find County Down at its best , " he went on . " We 've gone three straight weeks without a real rain , and we 've had to let the grass grow up a hit to keep the greens and fairways from horning out . Too much sun does n't agree with our grass : it 's fescue and Poe ennui , on the greens , Poe annlia on the fairways . Some fairway s have been burned almost hare in spots , hut , oddly enough , the older members seem to like that . They can remember when the course was nothing but sand covered by a thin laver of turf , and that 's how they think a golf course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lightning . Five more sunny , rainless days like this and we will be back to a primeval links . " Jones handed me a scorecard and suggested that since it was such a warm , breezeless day , I might find the course more of a challenge if I played the extreme back tee on the second and ninth holes . He had noted on the scorecard that , with that added yardage , County Down , par 72 , would measure 6,952 yards . I soon discovered that there were a few things Jones had neglected to tell me about the course . To begin with , the fairways are the tightest I have ever seen  --  only thirty yards wide on the average and at many points less than twenty . Moreover , the rough that edges them graduates within the space of a couple of yards from nice , normal , civilized rough into a dense growth of heather and bracken . On top of this , on several holes the golfer must fly his tee shot over a distant rough-bearded sand hill to reach the start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hack tee on the sec-ond hole ( where I foolishly took Jones ' tip and passed up the regu-lar tee ) , I hit the ball so far off line to the right that it almost kicked onto the sand ) bathing beach along Dun drum Bal . On the third hole , I hit an even worse push-slier , which may or may not have made the beach  --  we never did find the ball . While my caddie and I were searching for it , my gaze trav-elled to the beach and then to the girls lolling on the sand in their Presby-terian bikinis , and I longed to be loll-ing sensibly on the sand myself instead of fighting a golf course that was pat-ently going to he more than I could handle . Errors of the kind I had been making usually result when one at-tempts to steer his shots , rather than swinging freely , hut , confronted by one stringbean fairway after another and a succession of very small greens , I found it quite impossible to stop trying to steer them , Consequently , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the individual ones all mixed up together in my mind like a stew . Somewhere on that first nine , I can remember , there is an especially dramatic green tucked close to an open-faced sand hill , which towers fifty feet above it ; somewhere else , on a tong par 4- , the second shot must be rifled through a narrow passageway between two massive hummocks ; and somewhere else the correct line off the tee on a dogleg par 4 is over a long ridge . of gorse studded with bunkers . I managed to play the second nine more creditably , and so was able to appreciate somewhat better the masterly way the linksland 's natural features had been incorporated into the strategic design of the holes  --  which , when you conic right down to it , is what golf architecture is all about On the final holes , as the long Irish evening came on , rabbits began to appear in great numbers , and the sight of them munching in the rough was strangely soothing . When I finished my round , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ County Down : : My answers came fast . It was the most difficult test of driving I had ever encountered . It was , in fact , the sternest examination in golf I had ever taken . Since it was well beyond my abilities on a comparatively bland day , I could not imagine how even an expert player could cope with it in a ripping wind . " Whenever any of my American friends thinks he 's playing terrific golf , I 'd love to fly him straight to this course , " I concluded . " He 'd soon find out just how good he was ! " " Yes , it 's a fine test , " Jones said with an easy , consular smile . " I personally think it 's the best course I 've ever seen . Granted , 1 could be prejudiced . get lots of suggestions , however . People are always coming to me and pointing out that if we did x or y it would improve this hole or that hole tremendously . I tend to discount these suggestions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dub did an awfully good job , and I respect them for it . I think the course is right just as it is . " I followed the secretary over to a table , where he had a date to play cards with two members , also retired military men  --  a dapper little colonel in his late seventies and a heavyset captain a few years the colonel 's senior . I did n't recogni7e the game , so I declined their invitation to join in . In a break between hands , the old captain asked me what I thought of the fourteenth hole , a 216-vard par 3 that is a waste of sand almost all the way to the green area , where the land falls off quickly toward a small pond on the left , and a stout hunker protects the high , right-hand side of the green . I replied that I thought it a first-rate hole . After all , I had escaped with a 4 there . " Know what one visitor told me ? " the old captain said , laughing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the natives . " This drew long corroborative chuckles and a poke in the ribs From his friend the colonel . A minute or two later , when the colonel had calmed down , he said to the secretary , " Arthur , I have a suggestion to make . " " Here it comes , " Jones said to me with a wink . " The fourteenth hole is too damned far from the bar , " the colonel went on . " You shoold do something about that . " This in turn broke the old captain up completely . Jones had thoughtfully asked Inc to stay on for dinner , but a few hands later I decided that it was time to head for the local hotel , where he had hooked a room for rne . I retired at ten . Trudging for miles through bracken , gorse , and heather makes a man weary . THIS early-to-bed proved to be a wise move , for the next day  --  the day when I visited the Royal Portrush Golf Club  --  was a long one . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along a route that , bypassing Belfast , ran through Ballynahincb , Ballymena , and Ballymoney . ( " Bally " is the Gaelic word for town . ) It was another sunny day , and all along the road portly women in bright-colored sweaters were out walking their dogs . Port-rush , like Newcastle , is an old fishing village that has burgeoned into a holiday resort . The links have had a great deal to do with its growth , but for the hardy there is also good ocean bathing , and only seven miles to the cast , just offshore , is one of the country 's outstanding tourist attractions  --  the Giant 's Causeway , a fantastic procession of basalt pillars . The links are about a mile outside town in the direction of the Causeway , with the sea behind them and the clubhouse in front , off the shore road . The clubhouse is an un graceful white stucco building with the . blank stair of a roadhouse , and the secretary , Torn Beveridge , told me that it had been a minor resort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beveridge , a businessman From Banffshire , in Scotland , who had only recently taken the post at Portrush , showed me around the clubhouse . Its interior far exceeded my expectations . For example , the locker mum , a ness addition , proved to he an airy place with commodious wooden lockers , and the washroom and the shower room , faced with yellow and blue tiles , have a bright , Stateside gleam . But what struck me most about the clubhouse was its animate d atmosphere . Though this was a u. , cekda , the dining room and the bar were jammed , and there was an appealing low-key cordiality among the members , as if they knew one another well . Portrush is a large club , however , with a total membership of over a thousand , counting the members of a separate club for ladies and of one other affiliate , the Rath-more Golf Club , which , like the Mourne Golf Club , at Newcastle , serves the local residents who can not afford to join the main club . ( In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men would have been called artisan golfers , but that term is considered to be in poor taste nowadas , and it is customary to refer to them as town golfers and to their club as the town club . ) Portrush 's championship course , which I played in the afternoon , is something like the clubhouse in that there is a lot more to it than first meets the eve . The opening hole is a good par 4 and the second a good par 5 , but there is nothing special about them . A short uphill walk takes you to the third tee , and from that high ground a wide vista opens . To the east you can see the Giant 's Causeway ; to the north , a group of rocky islets , the Skerries ; in the far distance , past the Skerries but easily visible on a clear day , two of the inner Hebrides  --  Jura and Islay . If you are a golfer , however , the most impressive part of the view is the vast extent of the links themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the world -- four hundred and eighty undulating acres dominated by three ridges of high sand hills , each parallel to the sea . The land between the ridge nearest the water and the second ridge is a sheltered , swaybacked valley about a quarter of a mile wide . Stretching between Oh , ' Della Italia . Oh , Italy ... the center of all civilizations , the center of world travel . The pleasure seekers come by new , super-fast , transoceanic airliners like Alitalia.s . They come by grand steamships like the hospitable , distinguished Italian Line flag ships . Italy welcomes you with open arms and surrounds you with over twenty centuries of history and culture . If you ever dreamed of the tradition of the past and the excitement of the future you are ready for the new approach to Italy . Now , Italy 's network of ultra-modern autos trade is a nation-wide highway of wonders .

In Milan there are the world 's most modern art galleries a few steps away from 14th century masterpieces . In Venice you 'll find the immortal beauty of Piazza San Marco near the exciting place where today 's swing-ingest people meet . All this and more throughout Italy . And the natural beauty of Italy remains unsurpassed in all the world .

Enjoy the new approach to Italy , this year . the second and third ridges is a higher plateau . Nongolfirs who scanned this treeless acreage before it was converted into fairways and greens may well have found it grim and perhaps forbidding , but it is the kind of land that stirs a man with a golfer 's eye , and it quite overwhelmed Harry Colt , the celebrated English golf architect , when the club brought hitn in , shortly before the First World War , to look things over . At that time , Portrush 's original eighteen holes , completed in 1889 on a flattish strip on the inland side of the third ridge of sand hills , had been only cautiously extended toward the sea here and there . What excited Colt was , of course , the enormous possibilities of the still unused duneland . In reporting to the club officials that there was room enough and more to lay out thirty-six fine holes , he estimated that designing and constructing them would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what it costs today to build one good golf hole in the United States . ) This proposal was turned down as more than Portrush could afford , whereupon Colt , dismayed at the thought of losing the chance to work with that wonderful terrain , found way to pare down his figure by several thousand dollars : he volunteered to supervise the construction personally , without pay , if the club would arrange to put him up during this period and to take care of his basic expenses . This was agreeable to the hoard of governors , and Colt , whose many credits include the Worplesdon and Swinki Forest courses in England , and the New Course at St. Andrews , plus an assist on Pine Valley in New Jersey , got down to work on what many golf critics consider his chef-d'oeuvre . He began by routing the opening holes of a championship-length course over the high ground beyond the second ridge of dunes , then swung the course down to the edge of the shore , looped it inland and then out to the shore again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground . This us the Dunluce course , named after DelllitCy Castle , a nearby medieval ruin that overlooks the sea . In the valley between the first and second ridges , Colt built the Valley course . Only 6,207 yards long from the regular tee but extendible to 6,641 yards , the Valley is less exacting than the Dunluce , which measures 6,8119 yards , but there is a lot of golf on it . It has marvellous turf , which dries out quickly , and this , combined with its protected position , makes it a particular favorite in winter , when the wet winds prowl in off the ocean . As for the Dunluce , or championship , course , its supreme merit is that golfers of all degrees of skill can play it with equal pleasure ; like the Augusta National , it puts the expert on his mettle but does not crush the average player . The fairways have a generous width , and although the holes arc separated from one another by dense tangles of gorse , bracken , and wild dwarf rosebushes , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are only thirty-eight bunkers on the course , counting the double bunkers as singles . In my case , which I think might be quite typical , I hit a couple of wayward shots on the opening holes but was given a chance to recover adequately both times . This had the effect of bolstering my confidence  --  a pretty shaky thing after my assault on County Down  --  and in no time I was playing " mv game , " which means that I was hitting the ball far better than I normally do . This enabled me to see the subtler side of Colt 's handiwork , for the better you are playing , the more Portrush asks you to do . On the first nine , for example , there are two beautifully designed dogleg par 4s on which length off the tee can he a substantial asset , but only if it is controlled length . Similarly , the hazards in the green area tend to he quiescent except when a golfer attempts to play a too ambitious approach to the pin itself instead of settling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course has this splendid balance , American visitors generally like it and do well on it . No American , however , has won a championship played at Portrush- Two have come very close , though : Barbara komack , the runner-up in the 1955 British Ladies ' , and Bob Cochran , a finalist in the 1960 British Amateur , which he lost to Joe Carr . All told , over forty championships , Irish and British , have been played at Portrush , and it is the only club in Ireland that has had the distinction of holding the British Open . Since the artist , even in golf , frequently goes unappreciated , I found it heartwarming to learn that when Colt unveiled his championship course the club members instantly realized what a superb job he had done . Ire the British Isles , it is a common practice to give each hole a name as well as a number , and the sixth at Portrush , a 196-yard par 3 that invites a nicely cutup 4-wood shot or a long iron , was named Harry Colt 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an-other memorable short hole , the 21 1- yard fourteenth . Here the fairwai swings off to the left , and the direct line to the pin is over a steep-sided gully of rough that starts just beyond the tee and rims lengthwise almost to the green ; a shot that catches the top edge of the downslope usually tumbles all the way to the bottom of the gully , thirty feet below the level of the green . This hole is called Calamity Corner , and more often than not the members use the name rather than the number in referring to it . In our country , some clubs have gent through the motions of bestowing names on individual holes , but if any of them have really caught on I ca n't re-member them . The trouble is that the names we give our holes are , with few exceptions , either unimaginative or ir-relevant . On an American course , Ca-lamity Corner would probably have emerged as Trouble Spot , Ravine , Grand Canyon , or , say , plain Ernest R. Hall , after a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when disembarking from his golf cart . To enjoy a course , a golfer must phu it relatively well , for him , and while the acceptable golf I managed to produce was undoubtedly the principal reason I thought so highly of Portrush , a contributing factor should be men-tinned : I could n't have played in a more pleasant foursome- I was paired with a young uni-versity-educated plumber in a four-hall match against a left-hander whose company painted the center stripe down highways and a mid-dle-aged building contractor , a former captain of the club . It is one of the charms of the game that even when you are in a foreign land you can become quickly and honestly at home with your fellow-golfers , and by the end of ow round I felt that I had known my Irish companions for years . The man who had arranged the foursome was the captain of the club  --  Robin Wray , a lawyer of about fifty , whose office is in the neighboring town of Coleraine . At golf clubs in the British Isles and on the Continent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a paid employee , and the captain , a mem-ber who has displayed a sincere and ac-tive interest in the club 's welfare . The secretary handles the administrative chores and maintains liaison with the head steward , the professional , and the greenkeeper to see to it that their provinces are in good order . lie also works closely with the captain , whose chief concerns are the cluh 's tournaments and other matters relating to the smooth operation of the golf activities , such as the condition of the course . The captain serves for either one or two years . At the end of his term , he is generally a somewhat poorer man , for it is a definite honor to be appointed or elected to the office , and it carries a few social burdens , among them entertaining the members ( at his own expense ) at the annual Captain 's Dinner , picking up unreached-for bar checks with genial alacrity , and donating the prizes for the club 's biggest annual competition the Captain 's Da ) tournament . For some reason , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ captains of Irish golf clubs began to engage in a private competition to see who could put up the most lavish Captain 's Prize . Filially , after one grandee had announced that his members would he shooting for a brand-new giant-screen television set , the Golfing Union decided that things had gone too far , and stipulated that thenceforward no Captain 's Prize could exceed a hundred and fifty dollars in value . The Portrush members I talked with felt that ' Wray had struck just the right balance the previous year by putting up a set of matched luggage as first prize . A polished , convivial man , Wray had come over from Coleraine at noon to meet me and see me through lunch and the inevitable rounds of drinks that preceded it . A business appointment prevented his playing golf that afternoon , but when our foursome got in he was waiting to take me in hand again . Because the local hotels turned out to be filled up , he was kind enough to invite me to spend the night at his home . Our evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course ; home for a restorative stroll through Mrs. Wray 's gardens , which featured an astonishing variety of roses and the biggest pansies I have ever seen ; dinner at a restaurant on the shore road , and , subsequently , a stop at the Rathmore clubhouse , filled with friendly young men from the town who welcomed the captain warmly ; then hack to the Wrays ' for a long discussion of British and American golf , for Vra ) has twice visited our country and knows our golfing mores well . It was past two when we called it a day . As I headed for my . room , Mrs. Wray , carrying coals to Newcastle ( County Down ) , handed me a bedside book , Patrick Campbell 's " How to Become a Scratch Golfer , " and pointed out one chapter she felt was " super . " lArhy I read it at that hour I do not know , but I did , and it was super . THE County Sligo Golf Club is situated at Rosses Point  --  the tip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Sligo Bay , about seven miles from the town of Sligo , in the northwestern sector of Ireland . My decision to look in on ml-Friend Mixie Murphy and still keep to MacWeeney 's suggested itinerary resulted in an exhausting day behind the wheel . It took me four hours to get from Portrush to Rosses Point , and , after a short visit there , four hours and a half to drive back to Dublin for my dinner engagement that evening with MacWeeney . That Sligo-Dublin leg , across the center of the island , was dull going , but the morning 's leg was full of interest . It took me back over the border at Strabane and into County Donegal . At that particular point on the border , the Republic presents a sharply different countenance from Northern Ireland . The roads are rut- tier , the villages dustier , the vegetation shaggier , and , all in all , one has the sensation of entering an older land , far more rural and unsupervised As I was going through the town of Donegal , the hospitality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sign for the road to Sligo , I asked di-rcctions of a white-haired man in a tight gray cap . He told me I was al ready on the Sligo road , and then asked if I could give him a lift as far as Ballyshannon  --  it was right on my way . He turned nut to he that shrewd , witty , alert old-timer one humps into so often in Irish novels and Irish plays but almost never in Ireland . He began to talk at an animated clip , and I learned in no time that his name was McGaddigan , that he was eighty-two and a native of Donegal , and that he had gone off to Dublin forty years be-fore but came hack for two weeks each year to see the old town . He knew every bend in the road , for he had worked on it as a young man . " What do you think our wages were in those days ? " he asked . " One pound a month . The money is much better now all over Ireland , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making small fortunes . We 're a funny people , as the world knows , and some of the workers in Dublin have concocted the most in- genious schemes you ever heard of for making more money . They want extra pay for this and extra pay for that , To give you an idea , two months ago a boat loaded with bananas stood for weeks in Dublin Harbor while the dock workers were arbitrating some labor dispute . Well , when they got that settled , they found that huge swarms of flies had collected around the bananas , so the workers demanded extra money to unload the cargo . Fly money , they called it . Oh , it 's been spreading all over . Last month , some men out at Dublin Airport were asking for noise money . You would n't believe it , but there 's a group of workmen  --  night watchmen and people like that , who work by themselves  --  and what do you think they 're petitioning fors Loneliness money ? This is a strange land . " Mr. McGaddigan kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Ballyshannon . There , before hopping spryly from the car , he shook my hand and said , " I know I 've talked a streak this morning , but I know you 'll be driving a long ways today without company , and I thought I 'd try to entertain you . " A few miles north of the turnoff to Rosses Point , I stopped to visit the churchyard in Drumcliff , where %Viiham Butler Yeats is buried . ( It was Wrav who told me that the grave was there . ) It is an utterly simple grave  --  a rectangle of grave enclosed in a stone border . In addition to the dates of the poet 's birth and death , the tombstone is inscribed only with the familiar lines from his " Last Poems " : This is the Yeats Country , the " Innisfree " area , with Ben Bulben and the other green-brown mountains standing high above the sea and the inland loughs . Indeed , a hotel that overlooks the tiny one-story clubhouse and the practice putting green of the County Sligo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Yeats Country Hotel . If there were any literary pilgrims around on the day of my visit , however , I missed them , for during my stopover I was completely swallowed up in golf . Tn all intents and purposes , I was not in the Yeats Country but in the Ewing Country , County Sligo being the home course of Cecil Ewing , the greatest golfer ever produced in that corner of Ireland  --  a Walker Cup star for nineteen years and , more recently , the captain of Ireland 's teams in both the annual Home International match , with England , Scotland , and Wales , and the biennial European Amateur Team Championship match , in which teams representing the Continental nations also compete . ( Ireland won the championship in Sandwich , England , in 1965 , and successfully defended it at Turin , Italy , in 1967 . ) One of the first things I learned from Mixie Murphy , after we had greeted each other , %vac that Ewing was born in the Yeats Country Hotel . Ewing 's father had owned it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Golf Hotel . In fact , until the County Sligo Golf Club built its clubhouse  --  in 1912 , eighteen years after the club was established  --  the hotel had served the members as their headquarters . On the day of my visit , Ewing , who is a Guinness representative , was out of town on business , but his presence nonetheless pervaded the small clubhouse . A big , burl ) man , strong-featured , dark-eyed , and bald , he looks down , in an excellent camera portrait , from a niche above the hat . Photographs of Walker Cup teams on which he played are dotted through the two other rooms . On display also are the golf balls that he and Ray Billows used in their Walker Cup match ( which Ewing won 1 rip 1 in 1938 , the only year a British team has been victorious in the fifty-year-old series . The single non-Ewing item on any of the walls was a framed letter that must he the only one of its kind prominently exhibited by a golf club . Dated October 15 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House in Farnborough by an aide-de-camp of the Duke of Connaught , and it reads as follows : " 1 am desired by H.R.H. the Duke of Connaught to express his regret that he is unable to become a Patron of the Golf Club which is being started at Rosses Point , though at the same time H.R.H. wishes the Club every success . " Only an Irish club would have the humor to post a rejection slip . With Ewing unavailable for duty in the event that I wanted to play the course , Murphy had lined up two capable replacements  --  Tommy Costello , the vice-captain , who was a soft-spoken fellow in the auto-repair business , and jack O'Sullivan , another . quiet chap and a 1-handicap golfer , who was on holiday from Athlone , where he teaches English , Gaelic , geography , mathematics , and history in the town school to pupils ranging from eleven to fourteen years of age . The other member of our party was Dr. Charles McCarthy , a retired seventy - four-year-old surgeon and a man of somewhat different stripe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type , " Di .. McCarthy-epitomized another  --  the unstoppable joke teller whose repertoire runs the gamut from the risque to the ribald . No sooner had we assembled in the club bar than the Doctor told us the onL about the two bishops who went to Paris , quickly followed by the one about the aged Dublin publican who took up golf and the one about the Irish dentist from Boston who became a psychiatrist . I thought we were a vcr ? receptive audience , but Dr. McCarthy seemed to interpret anything short of wild , uncontrollable laughter as downright criticism , and when we moved on to the bar at the hotel he practically grabbed us by our lapels as he told us the one about the American tourists who got lost in Killarney , the one about the nun and the Russian countess , and the one about the priest who wanted to become a caddie . During lunch at the hotel , 1w stowed down a trifle , and I was able to catch up on matters with Murphy- , a very restrained chap in any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sligo , where his family is in the farm-tool business . It was a pity , he said , that I did n't have the time to play the course , for he was sure I would like it . It measured only 6,435 yards  --  per 70 but Harry Colt had designed it , and it was seaside golf at its purest . The best testimony to its quality was the fact that the West of Ireland Amateur Championship was always hAci there , at Easter time . No one had ever taken the course apart  --  not even Joe Carr , who had won the championship eleven times , and not even Ewing , who between 1928 and 1958 had won it trine times and been runner-up seven times . No , the club had few worries about the merits of the course . The big headache was money to develop things properly . As I would see for myself when we walked over the course , the clubhouse was in the wrong spot . The place for it was out on the dunes , near the ocean , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was nowhere near enough money . Perhaps the dues were too low . The regular members paid the equivalent of twenty - five dollars it year and the country members less than nine dollars . That was like giving the golf away free , was n't it ? Perhaps the tine had come to raise the dues . The members could easily afford it nowadays . Conditions were generally good , and the cattle business rues really beginning to come on . It was Something to think about , anyway . After lunch , when our party set out for a short walk over the links , we were joined by the club secretary Moray Mair , a sleepy-eyed man with an untended mustache , who was dressed in a rumpled , patchy black sweater and a beat-up pair of trousers . He was congenial and informed , but I could n't get over his castaway appearance  --  he presented such a contrast to the well-groomed secretaries I had previously met . There was an interesting explanation for this , which Murphy proffered at a moment when the secretary was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had spent the war years in India and then had stayed on to become the secretary of a succession of small upcountry golf clubs . Returning home on leave , he had gone to the west coast of Ireland for a short holiday and had found the unhurried pace of life entirely to his taste . He had not only stayed on but gone native and gradually become more Irish than the Irish . That was the sort of walk it was very laissez-faire with people wander-ing off by themselves or in pairs and then regrouping . Mair , from the high land near the clubhouse , directed my attention to two streams in the distance , which cut through the heart of the lower land on which most of the holes are built . Costello paused to pluck a clover and a harebell from the rough and to tell me softly that over fifty varieties of wild flowers grew on the links . Dr. McCarthy surged to the fore with the one about the maharaja who fell of an ocean liner and was rescued by a man from Cork . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the finest stretch of golf came at the northern edge of the peninsula , along Drumcliff Bay , where the tenth , eleventh , and twelfth holes perform a clockwise loop through a stalwart formation of dunes . Murphy pointed out the site in the dunes he favored for the new clubhouse , if they ever got the money to build it . At the conclusion of the walk , Murphy accompanied me to my car , and as he was pencilling my best route to Dublin on a road map the indefatigable Dr , McCarthy sidled over . " When did we last have such a stretch of tropical weather ! " he exclaimed , and then he shut his eyes , took a deep breath , and thrust his arms toward the sky . " It 's like the bloody Riviera , Mixic . If this keeps up , the English will he descending upon us in droves . " Murphy agreed that this was a possib il ity . " Maybe our usual bloody weather is a blessing in disguise , " the Doctor said . " Ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard across the shoulders . Then he strolled off and , with his back to us , waved a hand vigorously in the air . MAcWEENEY and I had a late din- ner that evening at the Slid-bourne Hotel , where I was staying . After listening to my report on how the trip had gone , he handed me a slip of paper with the names and telephone numbers of the men I should get in touch with at Lahinch , Killarney , and Ballybunion , on my second loop , which I would be starting the next morning ; with his invariable tidiness , he had phoned them that afternoon to make certain that everything was in order . Then we just talked golf . Somewhere in our conversation , I remarked that the courses I had visited had far surpassed my considerable expectations . " They are good , " MacWeeney said . " We have n't thrown away what nature provided . And we 've been sufficiently intelligent to call in the best golf architects . Old Tom Morris not only did . Newcastle County Down but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Portrush and County Sligo ; Alister MacKenzie , the modern remodelling of Lahinch ; Sir Guy Campbell , Killarney ; Torn Simpson , some of the revisions at Ballybunion . When you stop and think of it , at one time or another we 've lured over just about all the top English and Scottish architects . For example , take the course at Mullingar  --  you went through that town on your way down from Sligo . James Braid did the course there , and it 's an exceedingly good one . It has a wonderful plan : no hole is more than four hundred yards from the clubhouse . " MacWeeney paused a moment and smiled to himself . " I was just thinking of the story of how Braid laid out Mullingar . The old boy must have been close to seventy at that time  --  hack in the nineteen-thirties . He was the professional then , as he was throughout his ater years , at Walton Heath , outside London , He did his architecture on the side . He was very Scottish , you know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as much then as he had when he was a young man and winning those five British Opens . In the case of Mullingar , you could sympathize with him for not wanting to dawdle around  --  his fee was some ridiculously small amount like twenty-five pounds . Anyway , he left Walton Heath one afternoon and caught the Dublin night boat at Holyhead . He was met at the dock the next morning by the committee from MulUngar , and they whisked him by auto to the club property , two hours away . ' Gentlemen , ' he told the committee , ' I would prefer to be left alone while I do my work . I will let you know when it 's finished . ' And with that he began to walk over the property , looking for natural green sites , and so on . Four hours later , when he had the whole eighteen staked out , he called in the committee , showed them what he had done , and issued a few instructions fur the construction superintendent . Then he shook everyone 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night boat for Holyhead . The next afternoon , he was back in his shop at Walton Heath . " There 's a sort of companion story about Mukingar , " MacWeeney continued , with a fresh smile . " Some three i ears after the course was opened , a foursome of fairly good golfers was playing one of the par 3s  --  the second hole , I think , a tough one-spotter about a hundred and ninety yards long . None of the four managed to put his tee shot on the green , and this led to some loud grumbles about how unfair the hole was , because the green would n't hold a well-hit shot . At this , an old gentleman who had been sitting unnoticed on a bench by the tee , taking it all in Braid , of course , over on an inspection trip  --  asked one of the golfers to lend him a 2-iron and a few golf balls Without removing his jacket , he hit four lovely shots , all of them no the green within twenty feet of the flag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with this hole , ' he said . ' I think it plays verra well . ' " We talked until nearly three . When McWeeney left , he cautioned me once again about Irish hospitality . " If you do n't watch them , the people here will keep you up all hours , " he said . " The simply hate to go to heel . "
