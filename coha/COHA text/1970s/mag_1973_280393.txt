Mike Nichols ' Carnal Knowledge is a black comedy of sex that shows a great deal of Ann-Margret without her clothing . It won an Oscar nomination for the actress and raves from many critics as one of the best films of 1971 . But the Supreme Court 's anti-pornography ruling of June 21 decreed that local judges could henceforth decide for themselves whether any movie violates " community " standards , as opposed to those of the nation as a whole . " It is neither realistic nor constitutionally sound , " wrote Chief Justice Warren Burger , to require " that the people of Maine or Mississippi accept public depiction of conduct found tolerable in Las Vegas or New York City . " The Georgia Supreme Court therefore decided last week , by a vote of 4 to 3 , that Carnal Knowledge ( which was rated R rather than X by the M.P.A.A. ) deserved to be banned . <P> The case involved Billy Jenkins , a theater owner in Albany ( pop . 77,000 ) , who was arrested for showing the movie last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in prison , to be served on probation with payment of a $750 fine under a 1968 state law banning material that appeals to " a shameful or morbid interest in nudity , sex or excretion , and is utterly without redeeming social value . " As a definition , that might well be reasonable enough , and as specific as the U.S. Supreme Court 's new rules require . But that such a definition of pornography should be applied to as serious a film as Carnal Knowledge indicates how drastically the Supreme Court 's rules may be interpreted , or misinterpreted , by local authorities trying to decide what may or may not be seen by the public .
