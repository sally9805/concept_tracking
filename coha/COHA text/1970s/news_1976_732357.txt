txt Letters : Is Travel Really Broadening ? MORTON I. MOSKOWITZTHEODORE E. WILSOND . GREGORYMARJORIE K. LENTZCAL ESTESJANE ... pg . XX5 Letters : Is Travel Really Broadening ? Henry R. Ma. tin To the Editor : I was gratified to read Dr. Karl Neumann 's article , " In Truth , Tri.vel Is Not Broadening " ( Travel Section , Felik. 1 ) . Not only do I not gain weight on ' vacation , but I frequently take trips for the sole purpose of dieting . When I 'm away , I have better control over my food intake . For breakfast , I 'll have toast and coffee , for lunch some fruit and then a regular dinner of meat , vegetables , salad , dessert and coffee . As Dr. Neumann pointed out , the big difference for me is the lack of frustrations , tensions and a refrigerator . Consequently , if I develop hunger pangs during the evening , they are quickly dissipated , whereas if I were home , 1 might spend the entire night snacking . The minute I return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start my dietary undoing . For me , home is where the food is . MORTON 1 . MOSKOWITZ Brooklyn To the Editor : One piece of advice I 'd like to add , based on numerous trips my wife and f have made : seriously consider avoiding the so-called American Plan or Modified American Plan in which hotels include either all three meals or just.breaktast and dinner in their package rates . Our experience is that the dinner those packages include is simply more food than we want to eat , so you have the choice of paying for courses you wo n't eat , or ( if you 're Scotch , as I am ) forcing yourself to eat all : of it to get your money 's worth . Our advice is to j skip the Plans and order just what you can eat comfortably . It costs no more , and usually ( in , our case ) - Costs satisfyingly less . THEODORE E. WILSON New York To the Editor : I found the perfect diet several years ago by accident . After we spent several weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pounds lighter . And it was not due to illness , or turista , the local name for dysentery . In high altitudes , food digests slowly , so after having two cooked eggs for breakfast , I did not feel hungry until . late afternoon or early evening . Then we had cooked noodles in broth or sopa seta ( cooked rice ) or una milanesa ( veal cutlet ) . If we did not have eggs for breakfast , we settled for huevos rancheros at midmorning with rolls and coffee . The bread and rolls are fabulous in Mexico . ' We have spent five summers in the Mexican highlands ( San Miguel de Allende , Toluca and Mexico City ) . and each year I returned home slim , tanned , healthy and refreshed . . D. GREGORY Nutley , N. J. To the Editor : On a three-week ' trip in Northern Italy , my husband and I daily ate heap : ing patters of pasta . And lost five pounds each . We shifted our main meal to midday and gorged on Gorgonzola cheese and grapes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Admittedly , though , in between ' eating we trudged up medieval towers , tramped through endless museums and jaunted through twisty streets looking for tin-Michelin restaurants that serve , of course , pasta . Yes , " In Truth , Travel IS NOT Broadening . " MARJORIE LENTZ Wenonah , N.J. AIR FARES To the Editor : In trying to book a vacation trip , I found that ' in order to obtain the most economical fare , I should book at least two weeks in advance . However , the fare can not be guaranteed because the Civil Aeronautics Board can change the fares overnight  --  with no notice to the travel agents or to the public . In fact , recently advertised fares to Jamaica , for example , were outdated . By the time I applied , the C.A.B . had increased the fares by $20 . Perhaps the agency has increased others , too , but this one hit home because I really wanted to go to Jamaica . Now it will cost me $20 more to go during- the week and $40 more on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agency is going to regulate fares , we , the public , are at least entitled to a 30-day notice of any increase in fare to go anywhere , particularly when reservations are required from 15 to 30 days in advance . I hope that some action can be taken to regulate the C.A.B . so that from the date they approve a rate hike , 30 days ' notice ( at least ) must be given before that increase takes effect . CAL ESTES Greenwich , Lorin . Ronald A. Eisenberg , director of Public Affairs of the C.A.B. , replies : Federal regulations currently require that airlines file with the C.A.B . proposed changes in their fares at least 30 days before the proposed effective date . Often the carriers , for whatever reasons , wait until the last moment to file these fares , leaving the board only . limited time to study the proposed changes and little if any time ' to post public notice before a fare change becomes effective . There is currently legislation pending before Congress supported by the C.A.B . which would provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before new fares go into effect . RAJA RACE To the Editor : Richard Gebhardt 's account of the Baja California highway " Blacktop Bid for the Tourist : How the Road Came to Baja " ( Travel Section , Jan. 18 ) was most interesting , but the alleged demise of the Baja 1000 off-road race was news to those of us who participated in its most recent running two and a halt months ago ( and who count on more of the same next year ) . Paved road or not , there 's still enough of the original untamed Baja to ha press an easten sports-car racer . While the race no longer goes to La Paz . its 800 miles of boulders , cactus , silt beds and cliff edges ( the pavement is forbidden ) are said to be the roughest existing test of off-road drivers and machines . Certainly a high point was our post-race stop at Mrs. Espinoza 's cantina , whose fame among off-roaders is probably world-wide . We arrived at her premises , which are fairly unprepossessing to Norteamericano eyes , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the desert  --  a dozen wiped-out drivers and crew of the Women Sports Toyota team , all basted with sand and thoroughly larded with cactus . As we nestled gratefully into cold bottles of beer , Mrs. Espinoza 's minuscule kitchen produced a simple lunch on which superlatives would be lost . Fresh Baja lobster in succulent chunks , bound with a Mornay sauce of ephemeral delicacy , was wrapped in the thin wheat tortillas that had been on the stove when we came in : this heavenly dish was accompanied by the best frijoles and salsa that I can imagine ever tasting . It was one of those occasions when the tenses , expecting merely sustenance , expand and open in delighted surprise ; I could not have been more astounded if Lutece itself had suddenly materialized among the boojums . New York JAN ET GUTHRIE SMOKE RINGS To the Editor : We recently spent a couple of weeks at a well-known Caribbean resort . The food was good , service and accommodations superior . We ? came , however , to dread meals . Whether ? at breakfast , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from pipes and cigars , was almost always a problem . The opento-the-air dining and variable breezes made upwind escape impossible . It turned out that numerous other guests had the same problem and some actually complained to the management on leaving . Complaints by a number to the smokers produced highly variable results . We would like to know if there Is any way of planning vacations  --  short of querying each resort of interest  --  to determine in advance whether accommodation is made for the majority who do not indulge and the many of us who are discomforted by tobacco smoke . Name Withheld by Request FLORIDA-BOUND To the Editor : We were pleased to see that the Chesapeake Bay Bridge - Tunnel was included in Paul Grimes 's article on " How to Get to Florida by Bus , Car , Train , Plane " ( Travel Section , Jan. 25 ) , but , like one of Virginia 's " favorite sons , " we can not tell a lie or fail to put the record straight . roll for the Bridge-Tunnel now is $6 , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still a bargain , however . Where else can vacationers drive over and under 17.6 miles of ' water and stop en route to fish and " shipwatch ? " NORMAN A. SCHORR , News Bureau , Chesapeake Bay Bridge-Tunnel New York MAGIC CARPET ? To the Editor : Several months ago , a delightful article by a Frances Kogen , " Reflections on a Moroccan Rug : ' Only 1,600 Dirhams . . . A Bargain ' " ( Travel Section , April 12 ) , dealt with her adventures in purchasing a rug in the medina at Fez . However , now that so long a time has passed , I wonder if you could provide a solution to the mystery as to whether the rug ever arrived . In my case , we ordered two rugs made to our specification in the same Fez medina , and I am happy to report that they arrived about three months later ? unhappily by air freight . The shipping cost was about 25 percent of the cost of the purchase price . NORMAN HARDY Washington Mr. Kogen replies : Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safely in Miami three months after placing the order in Fez . It cost me $160 to pick them up at the airport . The cruelest cut , however , was to discover a local department store selling my exact Moroccan rug at less than 50 percent of what I paid ? with free delivery . P.S. I love the teakettle . ORIENT EXPRESS To the Editor : A final note , if I may , on the " Orient Express : No Murder , But a Dash of DejA Vu " ( Travel Section , Nov. 16 ) . I took Its sleeper frorr Paris to Munich , first-class but , alas , on a Eurailpass . A tip of 10 francs persuaded the attendant to move the lady with a deliciously Balkan French accent who was ticketed to share my compartment to another one , and I had my very comfortable bedroom all to myself , memories of Agatha Christie and apprehensive tingling of nerves included . Nothing untoward happened during the night , but the next morning , while the attendant was arranging my bedroom , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next compartment opened and a rather hungover gentleman , dressed in an elegant bathrobe , appeared , carrying a champagne bucket with an empty champagne bottle down the corridor to some chosen place of disposal . He returned devoid of his burden and disappeared in his compartment , closing the door softly and gingerly behind him . Ten minutes later , the door opened again and this time an equally disheveled lady appeared , again handsomely robed , carrying a sec // and bucket with yet another empty champagne bottle down the corridor to its place of oblivion . On her way back , she half collided with the attendant who had emerged from my compartment . He rose to the occasion  --  and to the tell-tales of her undoubtedly sleepless night by assuring her that black coffee would arrive in an instant . She seemed relieved . So , you see , romance has  --  or had not yet gone out of the Orient Express . I might add that the attend . ant brought me my breakfast  --  complete with cafe-aukit , croissants ( hot ) , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a red rose in a toothbrush glass ! Ah , civilize+inn ! MRS . WILLIAM G. MouuroN Princeton , N.J. WHO TOOK FORT LEE ? To the Editor : I hesitate to send you this complaint , for fear of being called a " history nitpicker , " but your guide to " 1776 And All That " ( Travel Section , Dec. 28 ) contains an item that could be misleading . It reads : " Nov. ** follows Washington into New Jersey and takes Fort Lee . " Howe did not take Fort Lee ? it was Cornwallis . While Howe was the British Commander , he remained in New York , and it is misleading to say Howe took Fort Lee . Shortly after , Cornwallis asked Howe 's permission to pursue Washington and Howe told Cornwallis to " wait , " he was " joining him . " He was probably slightly fearful that Cornwallis might have some glory he could not share if he caught Washington . It is quite possible that Cornwallis could have caught Washington 's almost spent Army and ended the whole aft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole history of modern times . ST . JOHN TERRELL Ewing , N.J. Author Sol Stember replies : St. John Terrell is both right and wrong . Cornwallis was the field commander who occupied Fort Lee and chased Washington across New Jersey , under the orders of Sir William Howe , as Mr. Terrell notes . However , Howe did not , as Mr. Terrell implies , sit out the Jersey campaign in New York nor did he hold Cornwallis back so he could have the credit of defeating Washington all for himself . He was not that kind of commander nor were his motives that simple . On Nov. 29 , he left Amboy , now Perth Amboy , to join Cornwallis on Dec. 6 in Brunswick ( now New Brunswick ) . True , Howe might have ended the war there and then , in December 1776 , but for the fourth time that year he passed up the opportunity . His reasons ? As peace commissioners in America , and for political family reasons , he and his brother , Admiral Richard Howe , wanted the war to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Howe believed that given a little more time , it would all be over in 1777 , and he was probably right . Washington knocked the schedule into a cocked hat with his victories at Trenton and Princeton . By the end of 1777 , Howe was asking the Home Office to relieve him of his command . In 1778 , he returned to England where his conduct of the war faced a Parliamentary inquiry . The Travel and Resorts Section welcomes letters front readers and publishes as many as possible .
