IN TRANSIT by Brigid Brophy. 230 pages . Putnam. $5.95 . <P> Brigid Brophy , the Irish controversialist , classics scholar , champion of animal rights and vegetarian , continues her war on the 20th century . In Transit , her sixth novel , takes the fight underground , where it is more likely to be seen . The book is a highly cerebral contrivance that cannibalizes such literary conceits as puns , anagrams , typographical innovations , styles of alienation and cultural shock . These are then excreted as parodic wastes , which , in turn , become a further source of nourishment . With such transcendent offalness , Miss Brophy seeks a form suited to her view of the times . <P> Her central conception is impressive enough . The modern world is an airport waiting room , " one of the rare places where twentieth-century design is happy with its own style . " Life beneath this vaulted metaphor is amorphous , ambiguous , oysterous . Culture , history , psychology , and even physiology are hopelessly confused . <P> So is Evelyn Hilary O'Rooley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Although E.H.O'R. can be anagrammed as HERO , the character is doubtful of its gender . Most accurately , ( s ) he is Miss Brophy 's way of saying " I. " It is a mock " I , " however . As Miss Brophy notes in an aside : " I 'm playing games , like a painter who includes in his picture a mirror in which he shows himself standing outside the picture painting it . " <P> In the world-as-airport , Evelyn-Hilary-Brophy- " I " falls in with a number of atrocities : a TV quiz show whose panel attempts to discover the favorite perversions of its guests ; lesbian and youth rebellions ; a nun hunt , and a plane crash engineered to secure human organs for transplants . In such an environment , rationalism mutates into absurd rationalization . Like rebellious cancer cells , words metastasize into puns and compound forms that lead destructive lives of their own . <P> Naturally enough , one of the many sponsors of In Transit is James Joyce , " my great Triestine compalien , the comedichameleon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the aesthetic trinity of Evelyn Hilary , the fictional " I " and Miss Brophy herself persist with vengeful logic to the very end . There , on the last page , the author signs off with a drawing of a fish with the word fin on its fin . Does it mean the end , or does Miss Brophy expect us to follow indefinitely in Finnegans wake like so many gulls ?
