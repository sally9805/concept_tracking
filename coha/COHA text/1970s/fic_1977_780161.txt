 | Embassy in Ulan Bator , Outer Mongolia . She made a mental note to remind him that he must be ready to change at Ulan-Ude , where the Trans-Mongolian Railroad intersected with the Trans-Siberian . The big , sandy-haired , forever-complaining Australian was Kenneth MacBaren . She had met lots of Australians and New Zealanders in her time , big-boned men and women who took the Siberian route to the Pacific as a kind of exotic short cut to their own continent . They seemed to laugh a lot , like Americans , although they were n't quite as noisy . MacBaren , however , was on the surly side . In the next compartment were those slobs of a Russian couple on their way to Khabarovsk with their bratty son . They had filled their compartment with smelly foods , most of which would stink in three days ' time , and they were constantly leaving bits of sausage and cheese all over the place , grinding some of the garbage into the carpet . What were their names ? She squinted again at the clipboard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Tania knew from experience that people like this would rarely leave the compartment . They would loll about , she in her torn flowered house coat , he in his soiled pajamas , eating their way across Siberia and leaving their dirty nest only to empty their bowels and bladders . But the worst part would be the little brat , Vladimir . He had already made a mess of the toilet , and she had discovered bubble gum stuck to the underside of the upper bunk . She positively hated all little boys , most of whom could not cope with the boredom of the long journey . Little Vladimir had arrived in a state of hysteria and , she knew , he would only get worse as time wore on . But Comrade Trubetskoi was a high-ranking Party official , so Tania dared not be too open about her disgust . In the compartment next to the Trubetskois ' was the gray-haired American lady . Fortunately , Tania knew little English , so the talkative lady would present no problems . Her rommate was an elderly Mongol woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drowsing on her bunk . In the last compartment were the young couple Ginzburg , probably on their way to Birobidjan , that little jerkwater town in the Jewish area . Tania resented that town , not because it was supposedly reserved for Jews , a subject on which she was ambivalent , but because the Express stopped there for only one minute . Then she would have  | to scramble , usually at some ungodly hour , to see that the passengers ticketed for that miserable place got off in time . They stopped at Birobidjan so briefly one had barely time to jump off the metal steps before the train picked up speed again . Passengers for Birobidjan had been more numerous lately , probably because Moscow had increased the pressure on Jews . It was not a subject that particularly interested her . As far as she was concerned , Jews were just the same as all the other passengers , to be treated with equal care . She had noticed , though , that the Ginzburg couple seemed particularly frightened , especially the woman . When Tania @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her mind , she clicked off the little light over her bunk and settled her body comfortably . She could feel the movement of the train beneath her , the rolling of the great metal wheels , a rhythm occasionally broken by the strike of metal on a faulty joint . She knew every joint on each stretch of track , every tie , every dip of the roadbed and could sense every subtle change in the rhythm , as if it were her own heartbeat . " They have just fixed this stretch of rail , " she told herself drowsily as she slipped with quiet confidence into a well-earned sleep .  | It had been a wild , impulsive idea , Mikhail Moiseyevich Ginzburg thought as he lay in the upper bunk , knowing that Vera was below him , also unable to sleep . Three years ago he had presented himself to the authorities and declared his intention to go to Israel . He knew he was taking a chance , rolling dice with their lives , but some people were actually getting out and things were getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five years , that neither of them would ever get a promotion again . And Vera Danilovna was n't even Jewish . He remembered how he had argued for a promotion with the head engineer , Kishkin , a warmhearted , good-natured man , who had been one class ahead of him at Kiev University . Kishkin was far from brilliant and Mikhail had spent long school nights cramming Kishkin 's head with the details of aeronautical engineering . They were both students trying to get ahead in the only way they knew , by educating themselves in a useful profession . Engineers were always in demand in the Soviet Union and they knew that , if they graduated in the top ten percent of the class , they would have a shot at the best jobs . They had started together . Now Kishkin was the boss . Mikhail had  | tried not to be jealous . He was smarter than Kishkin , but that was not what the higher-ups considered an essential characteristic of leadership . At first , Mikhail had refused to believe that his Jewishness was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he learned later . It began to matter a great deal . This was no subtle campaign to hold down Jewish advancement . It was government policy . Others began to be advanced over him . " What the hell can I do ? " Kishkin had said . They were walking along one of the streets in a deserted old section of Moscow . Kishkin had chosen the meeting place . After all , there was no point in being conspicuous . And the head engineer 's office might even be bugged . " But you know I deserve that promotion . " " Yes . " " There is no question at all about my competence ? " " None . " " The bastards . " " I did fight for you , Mikhail Moiseyevich . I did not go down without a fight . " Mikhail believed him , but could not believe that Kishkin had pressed the argument . They walked along the deserted streets , faces sunk deep into the high collars of their overcoats . " Did you really make a stand ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any reasonable man could expect , " Kishkin said gently . " It 's a question of moral courage , " Mikhail shot back . " Bullshit , " Kishkin said swiftly . " My choice was no promotion for Ginzburg or no job for Kishkin . Well , Kishkin has a wife and two children . At least Ginzburg still has a job . And everybody knows that anti-Semitism is cyclical . It will pass . " Kishkin put his arm around Ginzburg 's shoulders . " This burst will pass , Mikhail . " " I 've got to get the hell out of this rotten country , " Mikhail said suddenly , feeling the genuine sympathy of his friend , knowing that nothing could be done . " That 'll cook your goose for sure , " Kishkin said , stopping and grabbing Mikhail by both shoulders . " They 'll fire you . You wo n't get a job anywhere . " " It 's only a matter of time anyway . " " You Jews , " Kishkin said angrily . " Why ca n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; his own anger seemed to disappear . Is he talking about me , he wondered ? Me ? A Jew ? There had never been the slightest hint of religion in his upbringing . You could n't find a more dedicated Bolshevik than his father , who often ridiculed the bent and pious Jews , in their strange beards and odd clothing , walking to their broken-down synagogue . And he , Mikhail , had married a non-Jew ; hardly given it a thought , since the only reminder of his antecedents was a word on his passport . And now Kishkin , his friend , was flinging that ancestry in his face . " You 're right , Kishkin . " He could feel the tendons in his throat tighten , the blood rushing to his head . " Why do you put up with us ? If we are so impossible , why do n't you let us the hell out of this great Soviet paradise ? Why keep the parasite inside the walls ? " He could feel the cutting edge of his hysteria now , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He watched Kishkin stiffen . " For crying out loud , " Kishkin hissed . " Ca n't you lower your voice ? " " Jew . Jew . Jew , " Mikhail screamed , his voice echoing in the empty streets . " You crazy bastard , " Kishkin cried , as he turned and walked , then ran into the darkness . " Run away from the Jew , Kishkin , " Mikhail shouted , starting to run after him , then slowing as Kishkin disappeared . Exhausted , Mikhail sat down on the curb and buried his head in his hands , feeling the anger turn to bitterness . Then tears came , tears of pity for himself . The next day , he had presented himself to the immigration authorities and applied for a visa to Israel . The clerks were surly and officious and he had to wait for hours before anyone would see him . Then they handed him a long , impossibly detailed application and a battery of forms . When he returned to their apartment , Vera was waiting for him with tears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plant . " " So . " " They said you were fired , that you had applied for a visa to Israel . " " I also applied for you . "  | " Are you crazy ? " " This whole country is crazy . " Vera sat down on the couch , her face pale , her eyes flickering as if she were in physical pain . " I 'll lose my job soon , too . " " I know . " " And none of this bothers you ? " " We 're going to get the hell out of here . " " To Israel ? What is Israel ? It is a foreign place . " " Not to me . " " I 'm a Russian . " " I thought I was too . " " You know what I mean . " " Well , then stay . " He could see the big tears roll down her cheeks . She was warm and decent , and she had come to the marriage bed supremely innocent in every way . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms , kissing away the tears , feeling the salt against his lips , hearing her soft sobs as she buried her head in his chest . " It 's a gamble , " he said . " But it 's really pointless to stay . Here we 'll simply survive . There we might have a better chance . " " Chance for what ? " " We 'll be free . " " What does that mean ? " " I 'm not really sure , " he responded , feeling for the first time his own doubt . Vera did lose her job and soon they had to give up their apartment and move in with another Jewish family in the same circumstances . Days stretched into weeks and their savings dwindled . They heard rumors that others were getting out , mostly older people , and Mikhail began to haunt the immigration bureau . Vera became paler , thinner , the pressure telling as she dissolved into tears at the least provocation . At night , in the bedroom they shared with the children of the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and feel her thinness while they made furtive , soundless love . " I ca n't take this anymore , Mikhail , " she would whisper . " It is consuming me. "  | " Maybe tomorrow . " " You know they 'll never let us out . " By then they had told him that skilled engineers , especially aeronautical engineers who had worked in sensitive priority industries , would be put on the bottom of the list . " What list ? " he had asked . But the clerks never deigned to answer him . Finally he told Vera , " I 'll withdraw the application . " But they both knew it was too late for that . " They wo n't let us out and they wo n't let us back in , " he cried . " Maybe if you threw yourself on their mercy , " Vera had suggested . " How do you do that ? They have no mercy . " But despite his pride , he wrote a series of letters to his old employers and to the immigration authorities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Everything will be fine again , you 'll see , " Vera assured him . For the first time in months , he saw the color return to her cheeks . But then came more weeks of uncertainty , more waiting , more haunting the mailbox . When no answer came , Mikhail appeared one day outside the plant , waiting for Kishkin . He stood near the gate , watching his former co-workers turn their eyes from him , more in pity than in fear . This was how it felt to be a pariah . Kishkin saw him and went back inside . But Mikhail would not be daunted . He returned to the plant day after day , but Kishkin avoided him . Finally , after weeks of fruitless waiting , Mikhail made a frontal assault , showing up at Kishkin 's apartment at dinner time . Kishkin 's wife treated him politely , like a stranger , and told him that Kishkin was at a meeting , although he saw his old friend 's familiar coat lying on a nearby chair . " Please , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door . He shoved his foot between the door and the jamb . The woman looked at him with fear . " You must leave us alone , " she whispered . " He will have to report you . " I know . " Kishkin 's big form emerged from behind his wife . He opened the door wider and stood looking fiercely at Mikhail .  | " They 're killing me , Kishkin , " he said . " I warned you . " " All right , I know . I 'm not asking you to understand . Just for your help . " " I ca n't , " Kishkin said , his expression showing some of the pain he felt . " Your shit will slop over on me . " He looked into Mikhail 's eyes . " I 've been warned , " he whispered . " You 've got to leave me alone . I ca n't do a damned thing . " J " I 've withdrawn my application for a visa . I 'll renounce anything I have to renounce . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't be proud . Just say it . Whatever I have to do I 'll do . " " It 's beyond any hope , Mikhail Moiseyevich , " Kishkin said , shaking his head , his big eyes misting . " You must go , please . " Mikhail ran down the stairs and went to the river . He walked the streets for hours , cursing his lack of courage for not being able to throw himself into the murky waters . He spent days haunting the immigration office , urging the arrogant clerks for an interview with the person in charge , whoever he was . " I 'm not a dissident , " he cried . " I am not one of them . " His arm swept the shabby waiting room , crowded with Jews of varying ages , waiting patiently , the mark of hopelessness engraved on their faces . " They are deliberately trying to drive me mad , " he told Vera . He was extremely nervous and tense by then , easily thrown out of control , on the edge of total @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occupied only by Jewish families , as if they had been corralled there on purpose by government decree . The atmosphere was strained , since most of the tenants had applied for visas to Israel and all were living as if they were suspended in space and time . But unlike Mikhail , most of them took comfort in their Jewishness . They formed Hebrew classes for the children and discussion groups for themselves , all somehow related to achieving a greater sense of identity after two generations of alienation . Mikhail had attended one of the discussions , making himself thoroughly disagreeable by challenging their motives . " All this attempt at retribalizing is bullshit . The only reason you want to get out is that you ca n't make it in this society anymore . " " That 's only part of it , " someone said . " The persecution , the  | harassment , they have taught us the meaning of our Jewishness . We were wrong to think of ourselves as Soviets . We must think of ourselves as they think of us , as Jews @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harassment , " Mikhail said , feeling his face flush , " you 'll forget about all this Jewishness and go back to being good Soviet citizens . " " Never again , " someone shouted . " Being a Jew is not worth the hardship , " Mikhail hissed . " You 're all fooling yourselves . " Storming out of the room , he came back to the apartment where Vera , pale and wan , was sewing . She was not good at the work , but it did earn them a few rubles . " They 're all pricks , " he said loudly , running into the bedroom and slamming the door behind him . He got the idea quite by accident . He had been standing in front of the immigration office , milling around in the crowd , aimlessly reading a newspaper . By then he was totally indifferent to his appearance . He looked like an unshaven bum and he knew he had become a kind of character , an object of comic relief . Someone had come out of an inner office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the crowd to surround anyone who had come out of the office , to see if they had learned some great piece of news . The man in question was about sixty , bearded , bull-faced , with an air of stubbornness that made him look more like a predator than the victim . " The bastard said he 'd give me a visa . " " That 's wonderful ! " The man now had the attention of the entire crowd . " You think so ? " the bull-faced man replied . " The visa was to Birobidjan . " " That hellhole , " someone said . " I told him to shove it , " the bull-faced man said . " It 's the worst place on earth , " a woman whispered beside him . The crowd broke up in disgust , but Mikhail was curious . Stopping by the library , he looked up Birobidjan . It was located at the very edge of Eastern Siberia , a few miles from the Chinese border . In 1934 , Stalin had declared it a Jewish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 40,000 people , about half of whom were Jewish , and it was still described as a Jewish Autonomous Region . " You do n't believe that shit , do you ? " his fellow tenant said , when he had returned to the apartment . " What shit ? " " In the first place , it 's a hellhole . You freeze your ass off for six months out of the year and the other six months are a nightmare of insects and disease . Some Jewish suckers did help settle the place back in the thirties , but they came back to the cities like flies after honey . " It was too late . The idea had begun to soak into Mikhail 's mind that here was an opportunity to escape from limbo , to prove to " them " that he was really a Soviet , like a Ukrainian , a Georgian , an Armenian . He began to write carefully composed letters to the immigration authorities , explaining that some Jews had fastened upon Israel as " their place " only because they had no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had not followed through on their original idea of giving the Jews " their place of territorial dignity within the confines of this great socialist state . " He worked on the letters for weeks in the reading room of the main Moscow library , polishing each sentence , changing , cutting , reworking . " You stupid ass , " one of his fellow tenants told him one day , after he had attempted to proselytize the idea . " Stalin declared that place for the Jews to get them out of European Russia . It was another form of exile , a special place for Jews to freeze their balls off . " " Jewish paranoia , " Mikhail responded . " Siberia is coming into its own . It 's rich with resources . Cities are growing by leaps and bounds . What 's wrong with it ? Think of the dignity it will give us , a place of our own ; a land of our own within the Soviet Union . We 'd be proud to have Jew ' stamped on our passports . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You 'll see . I have found a solution , " he told Vera , who was no longer fighting him . She was passive now , brittle as a dry leaf , barely communicative . He knew the authorities would respond . It was just a matter of time . When the letter came , he ran up the three flights and threw it on the table in front of Vera .  | " See , " he said , waving it in front of her . " You thought I was crazy . " The letter was from the Chief of the Bureau of Jewish Affairs in Moscow . It was polite , oddly expansive and committal for a Soviet bureaucrat . The real meat was in the last paragraph , which Mikhail read over and over again until he had committed it to memory : " We have been considering reactivating the resettlement program in the eastern territory of Birobidjan , which , quite obviously , could provide an excellent solution to the terrible problem now confronting certain gullible Jewish people within the Soviet Union . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imperialists and anti-Soviet internationalists in the capitalist countries . We welcome your application for resettlement and are hopeful that it will serve as an example of the historic respect that the Soviet Union has had for the Jewish people . " " Ca n't you see what that means , Vera ? " Mikhail pointed out , trying to break through her indifference . " They will let us lead an honorable life . They want us to settle in our own place . " He felt his face flush and his eyes begin to mist . " We are saved , my darling , " he said , taking her frail body in his arms and kissing her cheek . " Trust me , " he said . " You 'll see . " With remarkable ease , he received permission to depart and he bought two " soft " tickets on the Trans-Siberian Express . He wondered if Vera was up to the journey . Her strength had continued to wane and she had begun to spend a great deal of time in bed , as if sleep had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become discouraged . The authorities had even found him a job in an aluminum extrusion plant . It was n't in his chosen field , but at least it was a start and the wages were actually higher than for similar work in other Soviet factories . There had been a few bad moments . Their interrogation at the Yaroslav station had brought Vera to the verge of fainting . The train agent had been intimidating and Mikhail had been too frightened , he admitted , to stand up to him . He lay on the upper bunk , feeling the bounce of the train along the tracks . It was nice and cozy living in this way , as if he were in a warm cocoon . Vera now seemed to be asleep , for which he was thankful . He had brushed back her hair and kissed her on the forehead , covering her with an extra blanket that  | the attendant had kindly delivered . At Birobidjan , he was certain he would be able to get adequate medical care for her . Tomorrow they would start having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bottle of wine each night in celebration . It was extravagant , he knew , but it was the least he could do for having been the cause of her ordeal . He felt the tension ooze out of his body , and a sense of well-being crept over him as he began to picture their new life .  | Alex 's eyes popped open . It was dark and it took him some time to rediscover his sense of place . Someone was moving about in the compartment . Moving his head , he caught Mrs. Valentinov in his field of vision and remembered instantly . Her back was turned and she was in the process of dressing or undressing , he could not tell which , only that the entire length of her body was naked . She was stepping into her underpants , the curve of hard buttocks outlined as she pulled up the pants and half-turned . He dropped his eyelids quickly , then raised them slightly as she fitted her breasts into the cups of her brassiere . He felt his penis harden and rise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyelids fluttered closed again , but he imagined her putting on her slip , the sound of her movements increasing his excitement . Then he heard her close the door to the washroom , the swish of water in the sink , and the sound of her brushing her teeth . Sitting up quickly , he squinted at the face of his watch . Despite the darkness , it was eight o'clock in the morning , Moscow time . It would n't be long , he thought , as the train crossed the various time zones , before night would become day and he would be having dinner at dawn and breakfast at bedtime . He quickly removed his shirt and pants and poked in his suitcase for fresh clothes . Quickly , he zipped  | up his slacks and began to work his loafers over his feet . He noted that the bottle of vodka was nearly empty . Standing up again , he began to button his shirt , goaded by some i strange sense of modesty , feeling the pressure to be dressed by the time Mrs. Valentinov @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front of him , wearing only a half slip . His eyes went immediately to her pugnacious breasts which seemed about to burst from their brassiere . " I hope I did n't wake you , " she said . " Not at all . I 'm programed to wake up at this hour anyway . " " The ingrained habits die hard , although you will find that it will be more and more difficult to maintain them on this journey . " " I can imagine . " " That 's part of the adventure , " she said , pulling a blouse from her suitcase and putting it on . Then she took a gray skirt from a hanger and stepped into it . He marveled at her nonchalance , dressing before a total stranger . It seemed as natural as if he were at home with Janice . She patted her stomach . " I 'm hungry , " she said . " You should be . " " The tendency on these trips is to eat too much . " " And drink too much , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " So , " she said , laughing . " We have a moralist on board . " " No . Just a doctor , " he said quickly , and immediately regretted it . He had tried so hard to be guarded and discreet , to offer nothing about himself . But Dimitrov and all his problems seemed far away now , and his suspicions about Dimitrov 's plans seemed absurd , impossible . I imagined it all , he told himself . " A doctor ? " she said easily , as if it were mildly interesting . " How secure . I can outline my ailments for the next few days . " " From the look of you that would hardly take more than a few minutes . " My God , he was being flirtatious . " I 'll make some up , " she said , coquettish , promising . She put her hand on the handle of the compartment door . " I 'll save you a seat in the restaurant car , " she said . " Breakfast is always a bit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Great , " he responded , going into the washroom . But before he could put a ribbon of toothpaste on his brush , he  | heard a great commotion in the passageway . He opened the compartment door and peeked out . The small boy was kicking furiously at one of the toilet doors . Heads poked out of doors and Tania came running down the passageway , her lips pressed together . She grabbed the boy by the shoulders and tried to draw him away . But he broke free and began bashing the door again . " What the bloody hell is going on ? " MacBaren , the sandy-haired Australian , cried as he looked into the passageway , his face still heavy with sleep . " I want to go to the toilet , " the boy shouted , grappling with Tania , who had pulled him finally from the door . Another head popped out from the compartment next to Alex 's . It was the red-haired agent , his " protector . " So they put him right next door , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to the toilet , " the boy shouted . Tania dragged the boy toward his parents ' compartment and knocked on the door , banging with the heel of her fist . " I 'll pee in my pants , " the boy shouted , his arms lashing out at Tania 's stomach . Finally , the door to the compartment opened and the bloated man in filthy striped pajamas stood there blinking into the attendant 's face . " You had better teach this young man some manners , " Tania said . The Australian shook his head , shrugged and slammed the door to his compartment . " You leave that boy alone , " the bloated man hissed , suddenly comprehending the situation . The boy smirked and broke free from Tania 's grip . " He was kicking the door , making a racket , annoying the passengers , " Tania explained to Trubetskoi . " Listen , you bitch , " he said imperiously , the model of stern Communist authority , in spite of his incongruous costume . " You do this again and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the locked door of the toilet and walked out into the passageway . " Who the devil is in there , anyway ? " he said between clenched teeth , obviously enjoying the exercise of his authority . Alex watched with some curiosity , feeling a suggestive pressure on his own bladder . Maybe the kid 's got a case , he thought . The boy 's father strode to the door of the toilet and banged against it . " Who is in there ? " he shouted .  | But before he could bang again , the red-haired man , as agile as a big cat , had moved behind him to hold back his hand . " I would n't , " he whispered . " Who the hell are you ? " the fat man asked , still flaunting his authority . Instead of answering the red-haired man twisted Trubetskoi 's arm behind him and moved him swiftly back to his compartment . Tania , left in the passageway alone , looked at Alex and smiled thinly , shrugging , as if such activity were all part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the passageway to her own quarters . Alex stepped back into his compartment , keeping the door open a sliver and pressing his eye to the crack . His curiosity was aroused . Why had there been no response from the toilet ? The train bounced and he pressed his body against the wall , holding the compartment handle to keep the door from opening wider . Then he saw the toilet door move , first slightly , then quickly . A man emerged , moving swiftly down the passageway , and deftly letting himself into the compartment next to Alex 's . Zeldovich ! Alex shut the compartment door and stood with his back against it . So Zeldovich was on the train after all . How silly he had been earlier to think that all that had gone before was a mad dream . Anna Petrovna , he whispered , as if she were in the room . Was she really one of them ? he wondered . The memory of Zeldovich 's face jabbed him . " Do n't be a fool , Kuznetzov , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had washed and shaved , he made his way to the restaurant carriage , where Mrs. Valentinov was already eating a big plate of eggs and a small mound of caviar . As she had predicted , the restaurant was crowded , with lines waiting at either end , but she had obviously protected his seat with great determination , much to the annoyance of the little manager . They were seated opposite the British gentleman whom he had shocked the night before . So they were letting him communicate without harassment , he thought . " Albert Farmer , " the man said , putting out a delicate white hand . " Alex Cousins . And this is Mrs. Valentinov " Alex paused . " Anna Petrovna , " he said boldly . " Very good , " she said , winking at Alex and smiling at Farmer . " A pleasure , " he responded . " She 's my roommate , " Alex said , feeling an odd sense of possessive-  | ness , perhaps a bit of macho . He remembered her strong , tall body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're luckier than me . I 've got a snoring Australian . " The waitress came and dropped the fifteen-page menu on the table before him . " I wo n't go through that again , " said Alex . " Eggs and caviar , " he said in Russian , pointing to Mrs. Valentinov 's plate . The waitress nodded and started toward the kitchen . As he watched her depart , he noted a familiar face in the crowd , the red-haired man , waiting patiently , big sleepy eyes trying to look indifferent . Poor Zeldovich , Alex thought maliciously , doomed to sucking sausages in his compartment and making surreptitious trips to the john . Mrs. Valentinov spread caviar on a piece of toast and stuffed it into her mouth with relish . Alex watched her , caught by the sensuality of the act . Would they have a brief future together ? Why not ? he thought , his confidence soaring . He looked beyond Farmer at the sky lightening over the low hills , a layer of glistening frost covering everything with a blanket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We are in Asia now , " Mrs. Valentinov said . She sounded wistful , almost sad . " We must have passed the Monument of Tears , " Alex said , still watching the passing scene . Beyond that marker , his grandfather had told him , was the unknown  --  Asian Siberia , a vast waste , from which few returned . " You were entering the gates of hell , " his grandfather had said . " What was there to do but wash the earth around this marker with your tears ? " Albert Farmer looked nervously at his watch . " We will be in Kirov soon . " " Where are you headed ? " Alex asked . " Ulan Bator , " Farmer said . " I 'm with the British Embassy there . " " Oh . " Alex 's interest quickened . Ulan Bator was the capital of Mongolia . It was the edge of the world . Ghengis Khan 's capital . " I did n't know the British maintained an embassy there . " Again he wondered if this mild-mannered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The residents of our little island always had their bit of wanderlust. "  | " So I 've heard . Anyway , it sounds quite gloomy . " " Quite the contrary . It 's rather exciting . " Farmer looked furtively around , then continued . " Just take a peek at any map . It 's rather in the middle of things . " Alex was , of course , quite familiar with the location of Ulan Bator . He had seen it on the map of China at Dimitrov 's dacha . I must be careful , he warned himself . " You know Mongolia , Mrs. Valentinov ? " Farmer asked . " When you live in Irkutsk , Mongolia is not as exotic as you might imagine . We 're very neighborly . " She spoke pleasantly , but Alex sensed a certain tenseness that had n't been there before . " Irkutsk . Lovely city . Been there many times . I rather am fond of music and Ulan Bator is , well , not exactly a cultural mecca . But in Irkutsk , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see , " Mrs. Valentinov said to Alex , jiggling his elbow with a child 's exuberance . " That 's my town . " " The waitress brought his eggs and caviar and Alex began to eat . " And you , Mr. Cousins , " Farmer said blandly , breaking the silence . " What are you doing on the Trans-Siberian ? " The inquiry came too suddenly , like a spear thrust . Chewing hard , Alex held up one finger to signal that the answer would be forthcoming , while his mind raced to prepare a safe response . " A private visit to ancestral haunts , " he said , smiling at his choice of words , suspecting that he had encouraged Farmer 's curiosity . He felt Mrs. Valentinov stir beside him . " So , your people are also from Siberia . " She spoke the words with a raised eyebrow , and he suddenly remembered . The night before , he had listened silently as she talked about Irkutsk , holding back his natural responses , feeling the tension of resisting his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idiot , he thought . He was suddenly angered by his caution . " As a matter of fact , Mrs. Valentinov , " he said , relieved to be speaking at last , " our grandparents came from the same town . " " No , " she said in disbelief , her eyes glistening in excitement . Then she ran her fingers through her hair . Could she be acting ? And so successfully ? " Cousins , " she mused , a fingertip on her cheek .  | " Kuznetsov . " " Ah ah . " She laughed , then turned to Albert Farmer . " He is traveling under false pretenses and a false name . " " Nobody in America could pronounce the damned thing , " Alex said in English . He washed the last of his eggs down with tea , savoring the warmth . He was enjoying this easy bonding of relationships , particularly with Mrs. Valentinov . He turned and looked at her over his uplifted cup , studied her high cheekbones and the deep-blue eyes set wide apart . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a fullness , a sensual richness , in her lips that he had not noticed before . His eyes met hers . She did not turn away . Again he felt a twinge of possessiveness . " Soon we 'll be seeing nothing but the taiga , " Albert Farmer said , as he looked out of the window . " The endless white birch forest . " The train seemed to be slowing . " Kirov , " he said , looking at his watch . " And right on time . That 's the most fascinating thing about Russian trains . They are always on time , to the minute . It 's astonishing , considering the Russians ' lack of efficiency everywhere else . " He flushed suddenly , remembering Mrs. Valentinov . " A ten-minute stop , " he said briskly , refolding his private timetable . Out on the station platform people huddled in overcoats , their faces red with cold as they watched anxiously for the train to stop . A line of women near the tracks suddenly came to life as the train @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ babushkas , young flat-faced girls carrying baskets stocked with foodstuffs and strange-looking bottles of a milky substance , which Alex later learned was kvas , packages of sunflower seeds and little bouquets of flowers . A motley assortment of people in pajamas , housecoats , jogging suits , overcoats and uniforms swarmed around the women purchasing their wares . Alex paid his check and stood up . " I think I 'll pop out to the terra firma , " he said . " Anybody like something ? " He had to test them . Both Mr. Farmer and Mrs. Valentinov shook their heads . Alex moved into the aisle , stopping by Miss Peterson 's table . " Would you like something ? " he asked politely .  | " Are those sunflower seeds ? " she said , pointing at one of the baskets . " If they are , I 'll get you some . " He moved through the crowd , brushing past the red-haired man , who was still pretending to wait for a table . Bounding down the metal stairs , Alex felt the cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the train , he noted the long line of carriages , including one tacked on at the end that seemed different from the others . Beside it , clusters of armed troops stood around smoking cigarettes , automatic weapons slung over their shoulders . Alex gave a quick backward glance toward the restaurant car and picked out the lumbering red-haired man . Alex smiled to himself and stood aloof from the crowd around the sunflower-seed vendor , patiently waiting his turn . When it came , he made his purchase and stuffed the bags of seeds into his pockets . Starting back to the train , he passed the flower vendor and bought a little bouquet , then grabbed the hand support and lifted himself aboard . The red-haired man had kept a respectful distance , but the string seemed to have little slack . Alex felt a tug at his trouser leg and , turning , saw the moon face of little Vladimir . He was apparently too small to get a grip on the hand support and was using Alex 's trouser leg to hoist himself up . Alex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giving way as his pants began to rip . " For crying out loud , " he shouted in English , kicking his leg to shake the boy loose . The boy screamed but held on . " Leave the boy alone ! " Trubetskoi had appeared on the platform , his face red with cold . " Get the damned brat off my leg , " Alex shouted , letting go of the handrail and gripping the waist of his trousers , barely keeping his balance . The father reached out and lifted the boy onto the first step , but not before Vladimir had lashed out and punched his father in his big belly . " Are you all right ? " Alex asked . " You bastard , " the fat man said , still gasping . The red-haired man had moved near them , observing the scene . Trubetskoi struggled to gain his composure .  | " Somebody should lock that brat up , " a woman said . It was Tania . " And his father , " Alex mumbled . " They are a menace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Alex followed her and behind him he could hear the ubiquitous redhaired man moving in his wake . Back in the compartment , Mrs. Valentinov was sitting in the chair thumbing through the pages of a Russian magazine . " I was attacked by a four-foot monster , " Alex said , rubbing his hands together and emptying his pockets of the bags of sunflower seeds . He felt along the waistband of his trousers and discovered that two of the belt loops had been torn . " I have some sewing things , " Mrs. Valentinov said , standing up and moving past him to her suitcase . The train began to move , haltingly at first , then with gathering speed . Outside Alex saw the army of grandmothers , brooms in hand , sweeping the tracks , ignoring the moving train as it slid smoothly past them . " I was about to kick the brat in the face , " he said , remembering the flowers , which he had thrown onto his bunk along with the sunflower seeds . They were slightly crushed . Looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I bought you this , " he mumbled , his heart pounding . My God , I aril clumsy , he told himself . " A bouquet , " she said , smiling broadly . She took the flowers and arranged them in an empty tea glass . " Everybody in Siberia is passionate about flowers , " she said . " These were grown in hothouses . But in the summer Siberia is a forest of flowers . " She opened the sewing kit and , squinting , threaded a needle . Crooking a finger , she slipped it beneath his belt and drew him toward her . " Now let us see . " She surveyed the loose loops , pressed one torn loop to the material and began to sew . Alex turned his head , and looking down , watched her with interest . " So , we are neighbors in spirit , " she said , drawing the needle in and out through the material . " In a way , " he agreed . " Although we 're a generation or so removed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she asked abstractedly . " I had n't thought of it quite that way , " he answered . He knew he was throwing caution to the winds now , feeling the sluices within him unlock . " Then why ? " she asked , her busy fingers pausing . How much did she really know , he wondered . " Pilgrimage seems so ponderous . Call it curiosity , " he said , watching her bite off the thread with her even white teeth . She re-threaded the needle , preparing to repair the other loop . " Or putting it another way , " he said , drawing a deep breath , " I 'm searching backwards in time within myself to understand my antecedents . " He shook his head and smiled . " What an insufferable pedant I am . When she did n't respond , he went on . " My grandfather was a Czarist exile . It was the dominant experience of his life and he kept it alive for years afterward , handed it down through the generations . I 'm beginning to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my genes . I have always had a sense of being the alien corn . " " You feel this way even in America ? " " Especially in America . " " Strange ! " She sighed . " Am I making any sense ? " he asked , unsure that he was , but at the same time enjoying the exquisite sense of unburdening himself to her . " When this opportunity came up ? " He stopped , watching her . She continued to sew , showing no signs of heightened interest . " I have this mind's-eye view , " he said . " A whole landscape has been imbedded in my mind and it just seemed important that I see the real thing . So , you see , it is quite possible to hand down an obsession . " " Yes , " she said , looking up . " Quite possible . " But he went on talking , carried on by his own momentum . " You see , my grandfather was reliving the great adventure of his life and immersing his offspring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , a convict . " " What was his crime ? " she asked quietly . Alex smiled grimly . " This was his crime . When he was sixteen , the head of his village 's council decided that everyone who sold firewood for a living should  | give him a portion of wood in return for a license to do business . It was really a bribe , of course , and my great-grandfather refused . His license , of course , was withdrawn . He was forbidden to cut or sell his wood . Soon he was barely able to provide for himself and his family . Goaded by hunger and his inability to provide for his family , he soon became an object of ridicule , a kind of village character , whom no one took seriously . My grandfather was just becoming a man himself , and seeing this happen to his father made him bitter and angry . One day , he followed his father into the village and saw him go up to the head of the village council . " Thief , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the mouths of the starving . You pig ! ' " " The councilman just looked at him for a minute . Then he cleared his throat and spat in my great-grandfather 's face . My grandfather , who was standing right there , threw himself on the councilman and ground his face into the mud . " That was all there was to it . Banishment by word , with no recourse , no trial , no chance to defend himself . " They were both quiet for a few moments . Anna Petrovna did not seem to know what to say . Alex decided to go on . " He did knock off a few years by helping to build this railroad , " he said , in a lighter tone . " When he was released , he started a new life in Irkutsk , your home town . He became a prospector and fur merchant . In 1913 , he told me , he could smell what was coming and converted everything he had into gold nuggets . He sewed them into my grandmother 's and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and made their way to Vladivostok , then on to Japan and the United States . " " He sounds like an adventurer , your grandfather . " " He admitted to being an opportunist , a briber , a cheat and a killer . " " A killer ? " " He may have been exaggerating . " " Everything about Siberia is exaggerated , " she whispered . " That will be your principal discovery . " " How do you mean ? " She stopped her sewing . " It is considered by everyone a beastly place , hardly fit for human habitation. "  | " Is that an exaggeration ? " " Absolutely . Here you have an example of good Siberian stock . " " And me ? " She looked up at him with a slow smile . " The soft life may have taken its toll . " It seemed a challenge . Was it an invitation ? In a sudden burst of courage , he reached out and grabbed her hand . It was cold . He saw her lips were trembling , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advantage . Bending down , he pressed his lips gently over hers , feeling the sweet tingle of her flesh , and the mounting tension in his body as he breathed in the special smell of her . He knelt beside the chair and enveloped her in his arms , and felt all his fears slip away . Whoever she was , what did it matter ? Burying his head in her breast , he felt her hands run through his hair , gently caressing the back of his neck . The surge of desire then gripped him , as if every nerve end had suddenly become kindling . Rising , he drew her out of the chair , feeling the full length of her body , his lips moving over her face and neck . She sighed , and said his name , and then drew out his shirt and her hands found the bare skin of his back . Then , as if some secret signal had passed between them , she insinuated herself out of his arms and moved back , watching his eyes as she began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew that he loved watching her . Not a word passed between them . Even the sound and bounce of the train seemed suddenly suspended . His fingers trembled as he removed his shirt and drew his T-shirt over his head . She stood now almost naked , and he reveled in the sight of her high breasts with big pink nipples , erect now , and he watched while she removed her panties , the last barrier . He looked for a long moment , then removed his own pants , and saw her eyes dart down longingly toward his phallus . No woman had ever looked at him that way , not even Janice  --  certainly never Janice . He moved toward her , pressed his lips against hers again , caressing her nipple with one hand and , with the other , dipping into the fold of her buttocks . He could feel her shiver as he held her , and knew she was already on the edge of orgasm . Then he drew her down on the lower bunk , a confined space , where they fitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with tremulous lightness , reached out for his manhood and , as if she were plunging a dagger smoothly into its sheath , brought it deep into her body . He felt himself shudder and reach into her , and she responded with the same animal sense of abandon . This was the meaning of sexuality , he told himself when it was over , still holding her , determined to keep her in his arms . He felt as if he owned her and , strangely , as if he had long known her . He knew it was all a fantasy , a reality totally distorted by the parameters of the train journey . Here , life unfolded within a confined space and time . He barely knew this woman , had spoken to her briefly , exchanged information , some of it banal and pedestrian , and yet he could tell himself that he was in love with her . The idea was foolish , adolescent , irrational . But as much as his mind tried to brush it aside , he found himself hooked by this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone but herself ? He explored her face silently , his gaze washing over her skin , absorbing all the details of her pores , the curve of her full lips , the straight bridge of her nose widening at her nostrils , and finally , above the ridge of her high cheekbones , the blue eyes with their tiny flecks of yellow and black . He had not noticed this before . Old doubts crowded back . What did she really feel ? Was he imagining all this ? " Am I dreaming ? " he finally asked aloud , drawing blankets around them in the tight space . The sun was higher now , throwing a cold glaring light into the compartment . Outside the landscape had changed as the train threaded through endless rows of white birch . " The taiga , " Anna Petrovna said . " That 's what we call the birch forests . Millions upon millions of birch trees , " she said , sighing . He followed her eyes , watching the trees , feeling the hypnotic effect of the repetitive whiteness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be sure what he meant . Everything was beautiful , he decided , putting his lips to her forehead and kissing her gently , feeling the chill of her skin . " I ca n't believe this is happening , " he said , as if it were something provocative , profound . " You are a romantic . " " Me ? A romantic ? " He looked at her in disbelief . " I am the least romantic man I know . "  | She reached for the hairs of his chest and crushed them in her fingers . You must accept good things as they come , " she said , smiling . " They have n't come that often . " He smiled back , but suddenly felt panicky . Was she trifling with him ? Using him ? " You have been celibate ? " " Practically , " he said , then , feeling a challenge to his manhood , retreated into bravado . " Well , perhaps not quite . " She laughed , showing the incredible evenness of her teeth . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Why do I feel I 've known you all my life ? " he asked . " Because you are a romantic . You are reading more into events than meets the eye . " " And you ? " " I think of myself as more practical . " " So did I. " " You should trust more in science . " " I did . Until now . " " What do you mean ? " " I mean ? " he paused , not wanting to banter , wanting to give her a real answer ? " science can not adequately explain this . " He leaned over and pressed his lips on hers , caressing her tongue with his own . He felt his phallus beginning to harden again . " I can explain the body 's reaction . What the body does under these circumstances . But not why . " " It is simple animal attraction , " she said . " Simple ? That would imply that all men are attracted to all women , indiscriminately . " He felt pedantic . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away , he told himself , his fingers roaming her body , reaching for her clitoris , caressing , feeling the need of her again . " There is no explanation for this at all , " he whispered , feeling her hands reach out for him as she moved her body to receive him . He felt the tight exquisite fit of her organs , the soft , yielding wonder of their joining . " I love you , " he said , the words coming smoothly , yet foreign to his ear . He might have said them a hundred years ago , perhaps in another life . He was not sure whether he had ever said them to  | Janice . " I love you , Anna Petrovna , " he repeated , feeling comfortable with the words now , as his body pressed itself to hers . It was as if all the heavy years of dreariness had disappeared , he thought . It was like being born again . He was no longer afraid . " You must love me , " she said , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's needs , as she drew him into her , her hands pressing on his buttocks . He felt the beginning wave of her trembling , like distant thunder . In his mind he imagined a flash of lightning as she gasped her pleasure , her teeth biting into his shoulder . She continued to tremble in the afterglow of their closeness and he felt his phallus shrink slowly within her . " I am a very physical woman , " she said , almost in apology . Again he felt a pang of anxiety , wondering if ' she took her pleasure indiscriminately . He felt vaguely humiliated . Suppose I mean nothing to her ? he thought . " Does that imply that it is always like this ? " he asked cautiously . Her eyes opened and she looked at him with indignation . " No , " she said , " it does not mean that . " " You have no lovers ? " " No . " " And your husband ? " " We perform our duties . " " Duties ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well then . Shall I ask you about your wife ? " " Please do n't . " " Then what of your mistresses ? " " I 'm sorry I started this . " " You should not question so much . " He was annoyed at his own jealousy , the smothering feeling of possession . She was silent , looking out the window at the passing taiga . He looked at his watch , his sense of time returning . It will soon be over , he thought , and felt her impending departure like a stab of pain . She put a hand over his watch and nestled her head on his shoulder , seeing the soreness where her teeth had dug in . " I have drawn blood , " she said , licking the small wound .  | She finished her ministrations , then kissed him on the neck and closed her eyes . He watched her slip into a light sleep , her lips parted , her breathing calm , and wondered what it all meant . What did it matter ? I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he felt his mind relax and sleep begin .  | In his mind Grivetsky ran through his options . The sun was slipping beyond the edges of the taiga , but he had not noticed the changing patterns of light . The crowded compartment was thick with the smells and tension of the onlookers . The old man sat silent , motionless , his one good eye fixed on the chessboard as he waited for Grivetsky to move . But the general was carefully replaying their past games , the string of losses that had , at last , revealed the old man 's strategy . He was barely conscious of the movement around him , the whispers of the spectators who watched transfixed , perhaps infused with the same obsession that had kept him at it through an entire night and a full day . When the train stopped , he had sent one of the young spectators to buy sausages and bread , which he shared with his old opponent as they continued their nonstop duel . " He will never beat him , " he heard someone say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effort . " They have been at it for nearly twenty-four hours , " someone said with excitement as the crowd swelled and shuffled , each man trying to find a place from which to see the board . " He will wear him down . " " Never . The old man is like iron . "  | Grivetsky heard the comments and willed them out of his field of concentration , with the automatic reflex of a horse 's tail swatting Hies on its hide . Now he had the fix of the old man 's mind . It was , after all , the classic strategy of the armies of the land-rich nation . Draw in your enemy . Always trade geography for knowledge . Husband your strength while your opponent spends his . It was the classic maneuver that defeated Napoleon and Hitler ; that destroyed Chiang Kai-shek . I will win now , he told himself , as his mind jumped ahead a half-dozen moves . He could feel the old man 's mind clicking over the same ground , analyzing the squares and pieces , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the compartment as if each of the spectators had ceased to breath . The old man 's gnarled hand moved , lightly fingered his remaining bishop , then withdrew . The train bounced beneath them , making the pieces on the board jump in tandem . Watching the old man 's hesitation , Grivetsky suddenly was sure of his victory . With that the tension in his mind and body relaxed . " The old man is finished , " someone said , breaking the tension in the room . The flow of life began again . The old man raised his one good eye , and blinked . " I am defeated , " he said hoarsely . He held out a gnarled hand which Grivetsky took , feeling its roughness . The old man 's pressure signaled his admiration . The joy was in the hard fights , Grivetsky knew . What was any battle without a worthy foe ? He took the old man 's crumpled ruble notes , stuffed them into his pocket and stood up , feeling the full weight of his fatigue as his joints @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to his full height . " You are a great opponent , " Grivetsky said in a gravelly tone . He had not spoken aloud in over twenty-four hours . " Now let me , " a young man said , obviously thirsting for his own taste of the old man 's blood . His defeat would put two more rubles in the old man 's pocket , Grivetsky thought , knowing the force of will and concentration that had to be invested to defeat him . He looked down into the old man 's eye and nodded . The old man smiled thinly . Grivetsky turned and moved through the crowd into the corridor , the stiffness in his legs and back painful . Passing through the freezing space between two carriages , he discovered a soldier posted at the  | entrance to the next car . It surprised him , confronting the impassive young soldier with his machine gun strapped across his chest , a finger on the trigger . He looked at the insignia on the tunic , and recognized it as KGB border command . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the butt of the gun jabbing into Grivetsky 's tight stomach muscles . It was then that he realized that he had walked in the wrong direction and , without a word , he turned , reopened the door behind him , and retraced his steps past the crowded compartment where the chess game was being played . By the time he had seated himself at a table in the almost empty restaurant carriage , it dawned on him that he had confronted a most unusual situation . Why had they tacked a troop carrier onto a regular passenger train , and KGB troops at that ? Normal procedures were to transport the military on separate trains , except , of course , for individual soldiers traveling under separate orders . He dipped his spoon into a bowl of borscht and fished out a potato . Why so much KGB clout ? he thought . If this much was blatant , he could imagine the strength of what he could not see . Normally the general would have put their little cloak-and-dagger games out of his mind . But this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hilt . Dimitrov was directing the little puppet show and Grivetsky Was one of the puppets . This whole exercise on the Trans-Siberian was a carefully contrived subterfuge . They were watching him , he was certain , but he could not decide the source of the surveillance . Dimitrov ? Bulgakov ? Others within the Army ? Within the KGB ? He pushed away the stainless-steel bowl and threw down some kopeks angrily . On his way out , he stopped at the table where the restaurant manager worked . The little man jumped up , as if the seat of his pants had suddenly caught fire . " Good to see you , sir . " " You know who I am ? " " Of course . " " Who told you ? " The little man hesitated . Under Grivstsky 's glare , he began to sweat . " That man told you . " Grivetsky pointed to the empty table at  | which the red-haired man had sat the other night . The little man followed the direction of Grivetsky 's finger , then looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Come on . Do n't play dumb with me . " " You mean the red-haired man ? " The restaurant manager sat down again in anguish . " Who is he ? " " KGB . " " No fooling . And he told you who I am ? " " No , sir . " " Do n't you lie to me . " The little man patted his pockets and drew out a crumpled piece of paper . He opened it , pointing with grimy finger . " Your name is on the manifest of the soft passengers . " Grivetsky looked at it , feeling stupid , as if he had lost some of his dignity . Then he was puzzled . " Well , then who is he watching ? " " Sometimes " ? the little man sighed ? " it seems that they are watching everybody . I do n't ask . I do n't want to know . I have a wife and two children and I have been working for the railroad for fifteen years . They come to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who shall not sit with whom . They drive me crazy . " He had worked himself to the verge of hysteria . " And they have a trainload of troops attached to the train . What do you want from me ? " Grivetsky watched the man 's lips tremble . He turned away and started toward the soft class , feeling the cold shoot through him as he opened the door between the carriages . So they are watching everybody , he thought with contempt , and certainly that includes me . He wondered if he should call Dimitrov . He could make the call from Sverdlovsk , the next stop . But Dimitrov 's line might be tapped . He could call Bulgakov . His phone was almost certainly tapped , but he knew he could make himself understood by using cryptic references that came of long association with the Marshall . Or he could call directly into the protected military line , but that , too , might be tapped . Entering the passageway of the soft class , he immediately noticed the strange-looking man with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spring seats that lined the passageway and was peering out into the darkness . Another KGB man , Grivetsky thought , feeling his contempt rise within him . " What are you staring at ? " he said with deliberate brutality to the seated man , who looked up at him , startled . " I 'm looking out the window , " he said , equally belligerent . " You think you are so clever , " Grivetsky hissed , leaving the startled man to contemplate his meaning as he let himself into his compartment and slammed the door behind him . He was livid with rage , a consuming anger that made him clench his fists in despair . Pulling a bottle of vodka from underneath his bunk , he took a long , lingering drink . He felt its heat immediately and leaned back against the wall . By the time he had drunk down to the bottom of the bottle 's neck , the edge of his anger was blunted . He felt his eyelids droop and his arms and legs grow heavy . Then something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . Something was not quite right in his compartment . He searched and re-searched the room with his eyes , probing every square inch and comparing it to his recollection . Then he found what he was looking for . Jumping up from the bunk , he poked into the plastic garment bags in which his uniforms were hanging . When traveling , he always reversed the garment bags , since that was the only way he could be sure the zippers would stay fastened . Now the bags were turned rightside out , and the zippers had slipped down a few inches . Someone had come into his room , removed the garment bags and reversed them . He opened the bags and drew out his uniform , searching the pockets and the lining for something amiss . What am I looking for ? he wondered . Perhaps a new kind of electronic bug . His fingers searched along the seams , under the collars and epaulets . Even after his careful search , he was not entirely satisfied , but he reversed the bags again and zipped them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , its iron discipline returning . Who was watching him ? Bulgakov would have the most to lose from any radical change in military policy on the Chinese front . Not that he would protest the strike . What was important to Bulgakov was not ideology , or even policy , but his own prestige and position . It was essential that Dimitrov make Bulgakov feel that he was part of the decision , that he had not been skipped over . But suppose it was too late for that ? Suppose  | Bulgakov had insinuated his own intelligence into the General Secretary 's dacha , and he already knew . Unlike Grivetsky , Bulgakov did not feel that a military man should be above intrigue and ingratiation . He had built his brilliant career as much on ruthless intrigue as on his military talents . It was Bulgakov , he decided . Under that bland facade of hearty camaraderie , Bulgakov was tracking him now . Somehow he would have to warn Dimitrov . He , Grivetsky , would have to learn to intrigue . He felt the train slow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were on the edges of Sverdlovsk . He took his pistol out of his suitcase and slipped it under his jacket . Then , still feeling the stiffness in his joints , he carefully opened the door to the passageway . The squat man was no longer sitting on the spring seat . Only the younger train attendant was in the passageway , busy with the samovar under which he could see the red glow of the coals . " Good evening , sir , " she said , looking up at him with wide , pleasant eyes . " How long do we stop at Sverdlovsk ? " he asked . " Fifteen minutes . It is normally ten , but we are five minutes ahead of schedule . " " And the telephone ? " " Just inside the station . Turn right . " " Thank you . " He stretched his hands over the coals , feeling their warmth . " Where is the man that was sitting out here ? The funnylooking fellow , the one who waddles . " " He went that way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the train . " He parades around the passageway as if he did n't have a compartment . " " Where is his compartment ? " The attendant pointed . She moved her face closer to his . " But he 's rarely there . He just stalks up and down the passageway with his funny walk . " He looked into the woman 's frank , open face . She seemed selfassured , strong . He wondered if he could confide in her . " And the red-haired man ? " he asked casually . " In there . " She pointed without hesitation . He had forgotten the woman 's name . " After we move again , please bring in a glass of tea . "  | " With pleasure , sir . " The train came to a stop at Sverdlovsk . Groups of women vendors shivered in the cold , their baskets held in the crooks of their arms . The train attendant scrambled before him and opened the door , holding it respectfully as he clambered down the metal steps . The station was nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch . He could hear the buzzing sound repeat itself over and over again . After nearly two minutes , he heard a voice on the other end . " I am General Grivetsky , " he said with controlled anger . " You must put this call through immediately to Moscow . " He read off the number from a little book he kept in his pocket . " It will take some time , " the operator said . " How long ? " " Maybe ten minutes . " " You must do better . I insist that you drop everything and concentrate on it . It is a matter of grave importance , an emergency . " " I will do my best , sir . " Stupid , inefficient telephone system , he thought . A bureaucratic nightmare . He looked around the deserted station . A few derelicts slept on the wooden benches . Out on the platform , passengers huddled around the vendors , stamping their feet in the cold as they made their purchases . Impatiently , he clicked the telephone cradle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growing in his gut as he tried to organize his thoughts . He was not sure how to approach Bulgakov , although , as always , he leaned toward directness . He would say that he was under surveillance and Bulgakov would have to make some response . Grivetsky was confident that whatever Bulgakov said , he would be able to find in it some hint of the truth . " May I help you , sir ? " the operator said , suddenly breaking into the line . " You must hurry on my Moscow call . " " I am working on it . " He forced himself to remain calm , looking at his watch , the minutes ticking away . Then he saw the funny-looking man again , roaming the almost deserted station , slapping his arms around himself , waddling about on his short legs . So they are still watching , he thought . With his free hand he reached inside his jacket and curled a finger under  | the trigger guard . In the station doorway he saw the train attendant , peering inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again and heard a clicking , but no other sound . He watched the second hand of his watch move relentlessly around and , raising his eyes again , he saw that the crippled man had left the station . He waited , growing more and more anxious , wondering whether he was doing the right thing . Suddenly he heard ringing at the other end and the voice of the operator . He looked again at his watch . Less than two minutes left . The train attendant appeared again , beckoning him , making motions of extreme panic . He heard shouting along the platform as the passengers disengaged from the vendors and climbed back on the train . Then , suddenly , startling him , he heard the sleepy cracked voice of Bulgakov coming over the bad Moscow connection . " Maxim Sergeyevich here , " the General said quickly , breaking into the babble of the operator . " I am at the Sverdlovsk station . I believe I am under the surveillance of the KGB . A trainload of their troops is attached to the Trans-Sib @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came back to his ear , the sound wavering and fading . " Can you hear me ? " he repeated , then felt an anxious tug on his jacket sleeve . " You must come . " It was the train attendant . Looking up , he saw the train begin to move . He dropped the receiver , leaving it hanging in the booth , grabbed Tania 's hand and dashed for the platform . As they reached the train , his breath coming in short gasps , the vapor pouring from his lips , he gripped the handhold of the moving train and , with a mighty effort , lifted himself aboard , pulling the train attendant behind him . They clung to the bottom step as the train picked up speed , moving past the startled faces of the vendors . When they had caught their breath , they carefully climbed the steps and entered the passage . " The train never waits , " the train attendant said , as they arrived at the entrance of his compartment . Grivetsky took the woman 's hand and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Over and above the call of duty . " " Thank you , sir . "  | She looked up at him , her cheeks flushed with the exercise and they sudden warmth . " I might still be in that booth , " he said . " You are quite a woman . " His admiration made her blush deeply . " You must rest now , " she said gently , " while I make you a nice glass of tea . " " You 're very kind , " he said , opening the door of the compartment . Once inside , he removed the revolver from his jacket and placed it under the pillow . Then he began to undress , feeling the ache in his bones as he changed into pajamas . He wondered vaguely if he had not . been too precipitous . Falling heavily on the bunk , he slipped beneath the blankets and closed his eyes , his brain numb now , barely able to register thoughts . He was , he knew , on the point of exhaustion and even the opening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause him to reproach himself for not remembering to throw the latch . Even the cool caress of a woman 's hand on his forehead failed to move him as he faded into a stupor of unconsciousness.  | Mikhail slid from the upper bunk , avoiding the steps , bounding instead in one jump to the floor of the compartment . He was hungry , the kind of gnawing , stomach-talking hunger he had felt only during the happiest moments of his life , the years at the University when he and Kishkin would stay up the entire night studying for exams , continually eating sausages and hard-boiled eggs . He had been locked in a deep sleep , and when he opened his eyes to the gray dawn , he had imagined he was in the University dormitory and had just closed his eyes for a moment between studies . As he felt the cold seep into his bare feet , his sense of time and place slowly came back to him . He ate some sausage and black bread that he had bought from an old woman at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form of his wife . She had hardly stirred since they had moved into the compartment , sitting up only once to drink some kvas . It did not strike him as odd that she continued to sleep . The trials of the last few months had simply exhausted her . He was surprised to see her eyes open . " You 're up , darling ! Look . " He held out the sausages and bread . " I bought some delicious treats for us. "  | Vera blinked and smiled . He sat down on the edge of the bunk and kissed her forehead . The heat of her skin startled him . He took her cheeks in his hands . " You feel feverish , " he said . " It is nothing . " " Nothing ? You 're burning up . " " I 'm so tired , Mikhail , " she said , her voice weak . My God , he thought , she is sick . He had n't banked on that . Pulling a couple of blankets from his own bunk , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She smiled thinly . " Where are we , Mikhail ? " " Somewhere on the way to Omsk . We stopped at Sverdlovsk near midnight last night . " " How much longer ? " " To Omsk ? " " To Birobidjan . " " Not long . " " Really , Mikhail ? " " Only a few short days . " He looked at her thin , childlike face in the whitening light . " How many exactly ? " she said , a note of pleading in her voice . " Four days , " he said . " Four days and then we are free . " " So long ! " She sighed . " Not long at all . Look , you 've already slept through two days . " " I have n't been sleeping , Mikhail . " " You have n't ? " " I 've been lying here thinking . Just thinking . " " You think too much , " he said . " Let me do the thinking for us . " " I 'm sorry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " For everything . " He wondered what she meant , felt her head again . It was burning . He was becoming frightened now . Opening the door , he looked into the corridor . The old attendant was busy polishing the brass window protector and a little woman with white hair was just leaving the toilet . " Is there a doctor on the train ? " he asked the attendant , who turned a mute bovine face toward him . The gray-haired woman stopped .  | " A doctor , " she repeated . The word in Russian was the same as in English . " My wife is sick , " he said in Russian . The little woman poked her head into their compartment and , seeing Vera 's flushed face , apparently understood . She felt the girl 's head and smiled down at her serenely . " Poor dear , " she said in English , as Mikhail brushed past her with a cold compress and put it on Vera 's forehead . " She needs a doctor , " Miss Peterson said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A doctor , " she repeated , going back to her compartment and returning quickly with a Russian English phrase book . " Yes , " Mikhail agreed . He had understood the word . The little woman held up her finger and left the compartment . " I 'm sorry , Mikhail , " Vera said . " Again ? About what ? " " I want to go back to Moscow . " " You ca n't , Vera , " he said quickly . " Things were awful in Moscow . They hounded us , persecuted us . Made us feel like lice . " " I ca n't do it . " " Do what ? " " I do n't want to go to Birobidjan . " She paused and lifted a hand to his face . " I love you , dearest , but I ca n't do it . I 'm not made for such suffering . I have n't got your constitution . " " Nonsense . You 're just feeling unwell . " " I 'm not saying that you should n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ca n't . I simply ca n't do it . " " You want me to go alone ? " " Yes . " " You mean you want to leave me . Forever . " " Yes . " Tears slid from under her eyelids and ran down her face . " I had no idea , " he said . Surely she was hallucinating . " I 'm not Jewish , Mikhail , " she said . " I know that they do terrible things to Jewish people . I understand all that . But I am not Jewish . I ca n't bear the suffering of being Jewish . I was not made for it . I have n't got your ability to cope with it . " He got up slowly , went to the washroom and resoaked the cloth in cold water . When he returned , she had managed to bring herself to a sitting position . She waved away the compress . " You must understand this , Mikhail . I am not going with you . "  | " We 'll talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by her ravings . " I will get off at the next station and take the train back to Moscow . " " You 're not fit to travel alone . " " I 'll be better . You 'll see . " But even the effort of sitting had tired her and she slipped back into a reclining position . Mikhail could understand her words , but could not believe she meant them . Why now ? All of a sudden , after months and months of bearing with him . A knock on the compartment door startled him , and he jumped up and opened it . " The doctor , " Miss Peterson said in Russian , pointing to a tall man , his hair uncombed , his eyes still puffy with sleep . He wore slacks and a pajama top . Without a word , he withdrew a stethoscope from his bag and warmed it in his hand . After a few moments , he thrust a thermometer into her mouth and felt her pulse . " She seemed all right in Moscow , " Mikhail whispered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was to blame . I should have paid more attention to her , he told himself . I was too busy with my own self-pity . Surely , though , now it was her illness talking . They had been through too much together to quit now . " How long has she been like this ? " Dr. Cousins asked . " I do n't know , " Mikhail answered . " She has been quietly sleeping . " " Can I see you outside for a moment ? " Without waiting for an answer , the doctor opened the compartment door and moved into the passageway . Mikhail followed . " Is it serious ? " " She has pneumonia , " Dr. Cousins said . " I ca n't tell what kind , specifically . Her temperature is 103 . Frankly , I 'd recommend hospitalization at the first available opportunity . " He reached into his bag and pulled out two vials of pills . " Give her these . This one is an antibiotic . It will not cure her , only help ward off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They 're aspirin to control fever . " He looked at his watch . " What 's the next station ? " " Omsk . We should arrive there in a few hours . "  | " Good . See that you make hospitalization arrangements . " " You do n't think she can make the trip if she stays in bed ? " " I did n't say that , " Dr. Cousins snapped . " Only that I recommend hospitalization . She is rundown , obviously , and apparently not very strong . Why look for trouble ? " " There can be no mistake ? " " In my business there are always mistakes , " Dr. Cousins replied . " I ca n't confirm a diagnosis of pneumonia without an X ray . But believe me , it 's a pretty good bet . " The doctor seemed frank and businesslike and Mikhail , although he tried , could find no reason to doubt his words . Mikhail swallowed deeply and looked into Dr. Cousins ' eyes , measuring them for understanding . The doctor stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Doctor ? " Mikhail began . He sighed . There was a long pause . " Yes ? " " She has been saying things , " Mikhail stammered . " Strange , hysterical things . She wants to leave me . " A sob gargled in his throat . He controlled himself . " What I want to know , Doctor " ? he hesitated ? " is it possible that the illness is making her mind play tricks ? " He watched the doctor search his mind for a proper answer , then interrupted , feeling that more argument was necessary . " I am a Jew , you see , " Mikhail said , feeling the floodgates open . But he could see that the explanation was not enough for the doctor , who seemed confused . " You are an American . I 'm sorry . I know it must be strange . But you see we are having a Jewish problem at the moment in Russia . Because of it , I have lost my job . Then I applied for a visa to Israel and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Are you following me ? " " Somewhat , " the doctor said . " But I really do n't see , Mr. ? ? " " Ginzburg . " " Mr. Ginzburg . Yes , I can understand your dilemma . If you are asking for medical advice , I 'd say that you should get her to a hospital as soon as possible . As for the other , I 'm not qualfied to make much of a judgment , except that it 's quite a stupid idea of the Russian Government to persecute anybody . " Dr. Cousins turned and started down the passageway . " And is her illness making her say things that she can not mean ? "  | Dr. Cousins stopped , and turned to face Mikhail . " I can not say for sure . " " But it is possible ? " Mikhail persisted . " In a fevered , weakened condition anything is possible . But there is no proof . I am not a doctor of the mind , Mr. Ginzburg . " Mikhail felt a sinking in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some rest yourself , " Dr. Cousins said gently , squeezing Mikhail 's arm . " I 'll stop in later , " he said . " And if you need any help in terms of the hospitalization ? " " Thank you , Doctor . " Mikhail watched as the doctor let himself into his own compartment , leaving him alone in the passageway , then he went back inside . The gray-haired lady had tidied Vera 's bed and gone back to her own compartment . Mikhail poured a glassful of water and lifted Vera so she could drink . He put the pills between her lips and urged her to swallow the water . She gagged momentarily , then gulped and looked up at him , her eyes shining . Her lids were heavy , like little hoods . " You must let me go back to Moscow , Mikhail , " she said . " Whatever you wish , my darling . " " I wish I was stronger , Mikhail . " " I understand . " " You must forgive me . " " Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure from the bunk and held her to him , feeling the tears start , trying with every effort of his will to keep his shoulders steady so that she would not know he was crying .  | Godorov stood in the frigid space between the cars and felt the cold seep into his bones . Cold seemed to ease his pain , perhaps freezing the nerves . He leaned against the frigid metal walls . Immobility always increased his misery and on the train it was compounded unmercifully . The only escape was to continue moving , walking along the passageways , never alighting in one spot for more than a few moments . But the memories of his old agony never stopped , dredged up from his subconscious , perhaps , by the movement of this infernal train . Soon he would be confronting Shmiot , and he would wipe out his debt of pain . It gave him courage to think in those terms . He knew he had been strong and had let nothing stand in the way of that central idea . There had been false @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a face in the crowd that he was certain was Shmiot 's : the shape of the head , the arch of the nose , the wide-set , cruel eyes . Sometimes he would spend days stalking a likely prospect , studying the man , wondering if his memory was playing tricks on him , and , for a while , he had begun to see Shmiots everywhere . But he knew that he would have no trouble identifying Shmiot at close quarters . There was a  | sharp cloying smell about the man that he was sure would be the final confirmation . The idea of Shmiot , the imagined act of revenge had given Godorov 's life a goal . And the sweet cry of pain as he dug his knee into Shmiot 's spine and crushed his testicles would be to him like the sound of a thousand angels welcoming him into the Gates of Heaven . A man and a blonde woman came into the space between the trains where he stood in the frigid air , his back against the metal walls . The man looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holding open the heavy door for the woman . An American , Godorov thought . The woman was tall , well-proportioned , self-assured as Natasha had been . Natasha , too , had been one of the sustaining pillars of his life , an oasis from the desert of his hate , although his memory of her had faded with the passage of time . Sometimes , when even movement could not relieve the agony of his pain , he would find that empty place in his memory where Natasha lay buried , resummoning the images of her with great care , as if the slightest jolt might break them into a thousand pieces . Even now , beyond the agony of his pain , he remembered his homecoming evening , the night he returned to Georgia after the war . The whole village seemed to have conspired to leave Natasha and him alone , and they walked along beside the fields that surrounded the village . The arc of the sky was full of stars , which seemed like a million candles lit especially for his triumphant return . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hay and they lay on it , looking up into the sky . It was the vision of that sky that left the strongest images in his memory and years later , in moments of his greatest pain , he could trace the exact patterns of the constellation frozen in the vast bowl of blackness . He knew they had made love , but that he could not relive . He remembered only that somehow Natasha 's naked flesh had become luminescent . That was the apogee of his life , the one sweet irrevocable moment of joy , the beginning and the end , all at the same time . Ten years later there was a second homecoming , and this time he limped through the town from the railroad station with a heavy , broken step . His father had died by then and his mother was ravaged by sickness and worry . She barely recognized him at first , and she had opened the door indifferently , as if to a stranger .  | He had stayed around the house for only a day or so . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Natasha , or someone whom he had imagined to be Natasha . She was a dull hulk of a woman in a shabby coat , holding a small , equally dull-looking little boy by the hand as they waited patiently in line in front of the store . Seeing her convinced Godorov that even this the Gulag had taken away from him . Only his hate was left . The momentary relief from pain that the cold had induced disappeared quickly and each bounce jarred his spine again . He passed through the restaurant car , and waddled his way through the crowd waiting at the entrance . As he walked , he heard a rippling wave of laughter pass through the people in the car . All eyes had turned toward him . Godorov had grown used to ridicule . He had quickly discovered after his injury that his walk made people smile . Some of the men at the Gulag had even gone as far as to quack when he passed . At first he had been quick to take offense , getting in fistfights and putting the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then one day he twisted a man 's ear right off and that won him the permanent respect of his fellow prisoners . Now , in the restaurant car , he knew instinctively that he was being laughed at and he stopped suddenly to glare into the face of one of the diners , a foreign-looking sandy-haired man with a high-pitched laugh . He shook his head helplessly as he met Godorov 's stare , unable to control himself , pointing at something behind Godorov . He turned sharply to find a little boy following him , imitating his walk . The little boy stopped in his tracks as Godorov caught him . For a moment they stared at each other . Then , turning , Godorov moved quickly out the other end of the carriage . He heard the laughter begin to ripple again , and knew that the boy had resumed his imitation . He pushed through the carriage doors into the hard class , with its peculiar disarray and mixture of smells . Soon the laughter began again . People who stood in the passageway looked at him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their heads out of their compartments to join the fun . He knew that the boy , exhilarated by the attention , was still following him . Without looking back , he goaded his broken body into greater speed which , he knew , only emphasized the waddle and increased his pain . Pushing into a crowd watching a chess match , he moved on quickly ,  | hoping to lose the child in the crowd . Looking back , Godorov could see the little boy waddling along , stopping when he stopped , moving when he moved . He passed through other hard-class carriages . Still the boy dogged him and the laughter rang in his ears . Finally he reached the last carriage , only to be confronted by a fierce-looking soldier with a machine gun hitched across his chest . The young soldier looked beyond him at the boy and snickered too . Then Godorov sensed that the train was grinding to a stop . Squinting through a mud-caked window he read the word " Omsk " and saw the everpresent statue of Lenin , polished and glistening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he climbed down to the platform and made his way down the length of the station to where the soft-class carriage was standing . He knew that boy was still behind him . People giggled , clucked their tongues and pointed to call the scene to the attention of others . Godorov 's irritation was growing now . Who among them , he thought bitterly , could possibly know how deeply abused he felt ? But then , his whole life had been the same . As he walked along the platform , the boy waddling in his wake , his mind began to focus on a plan of revenge . He stopped for a moment and looked back into the face of the boy . Emboldened by the sensation he had created , Vladimir walked right up to him and stopped just a few feet away . Godorov forced a broad smile . The boy returned it , reassured that his little imitation apparently had won the admiration even of its victim . Godorov turned again and headed into the station , a long , low building . Few people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warm . They slumped on benches , dozed or read papers , trying hard to look like passengers waiting for a train . They ignored the spectacle of Godorov and his shadow , and he was able to survey the station 's interior . He had no fixed idea what he was looking for , only that it had become important to him to find a method of revenge . In the far corner of the station he saw a small anteroom , its door ajar . He headed toward it , followed by Vladimir , who continued to perform even though no one was watching . Godorov paused for a moment to pick up a newspaper lying folded on the floor , then he moved on . The boy followed , intent on his performance . Once inside the room , Godorov quickly stepped aside , flattening himself against the wall behind the door . The boy followed , a lamb to  | the slaughter , Godorov told himself . He folded the newspaper again to increase its thickness . Then , before the boy could turn , Godorov ducked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same time inserting the newspaper between the door and the jamb . The pressure created a tight wedge . Vladimir would not be able to open it from the inside . Godorov went straight back to the platform , where passengers clustered around the carriage entrances . A fat woman in a dirty housecoat , her hair wrapped in paper curlers , stood on the platform beside the soft carriage , searching the faces in the diminishing crowd . " Vladimir ! " she screeched . The people on the platform stared . " Vladimir , " the woman cried frantically . A uniformed official walked toward her . Godorov reached for the handhold and painfully hauled his squat body onto the metal steps . At the top he turned to watch the spectacle , chuckling to himself . " Vladimir , " the woman cried again , her hysteria mounting . " Vladimir ! " A fat man pushed past Godorov , shoving him aside rudely and clambering down the steps . " I ca n't find him on the train , " the man said . " My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cried , her voice shrill . " Vladimir ! " The uniformed official tried to restrain her , but she slapped him sharply in the face and began to run , her heavy breasts jiggling under her housecoat . " The little brat 's probably hiding somewhere on the train , " the young train attendant said . She stood behind Godorov on the steps . " I tell you , he 's not on the train , " the fat man insisted , his pose of officiousness gone now . He knelt to check the undercarriage of the train , looking like a man at prayer . " You must get this train moving , " another uniformed man said . He had just emerged from the station and , by his bearing and attitude , was obviously in charge . " She says her little boy is not on board , " the first uniformed official explained . " The schedule must be maintained , " the man in charge said with emphasis . Godorov watched calmly . Now there is something to imitate , he  | told himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Vladimir ! " she screamed as she ran back and forth like a stuck pig . Her housecoat had become undone , partly revealing her fat and pendulous breasts . Godorov sensed a crowd forming behind him . He saw a small grayhaired woman , the American and the blonde lady . " They have lost a boy , " the gray-haired woman volunteered . " How unfortunate , " someone said . " Dennis the Menace , " the American said , smiling . Tania looked toward the front of the train . " The mother is standing on the tracks in front of the engine and the engineer is furious . " The crowd thickened around the uniformed man in charge . A tall military officer wearing the KGB insignia stalked through the crowd , confronting the man in charge . " We need your help , Major , " the man said . " Could we use some of your men to help find the missing boy ? " " You must assist us , sir , " the fat man pleaded , while the officer looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rear of the train , signaling as he walked . Suddenly groups of soldiers materialized , fanning out in all directions along the platform , machine guns banging across their chests as they moved . The train attendant darted into the crowd , then emerged to report back to the passengers huddled on the steps . " The troops are searching the train and the station , " she said . " Suppose they do n't find the boy ? " The gray-haired woman asked Godorov softly . He shrugged . What did it matter ? he thought . It was something to enjoy , a rare moment of pleasure , a harbinger of what he might feel with Shmiot . Besides , something had at last bent to his will . The delay might mean a massive disruption in the schedule of trains rolling over the six thousand miles of the Trans-Siberian track . And that was no small achievement . He , Godorov , had forced his will on others . The troops had just begun to search the soft-class carriages when a shout went up . " They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone yelled and all eyes  | turned toward the entrance of the station to see little Vladimir emerge , smiling and obviously enjoying the sudden attention . People began to applaud and the boy 's mother stopped her incessant screaming and clutched him , squirming , to her ample body . " That ends that , " the train attendant said , lifting herself back aboard . The crowd hustled into the train , Godorov along with them . He felt the pain in his wracked body sputter and shift as he stretched out on his bunk . He was oddly content . It was an emotion he could barely identify , but once he had , his pain eased and he slipped quietly into a deep sleep .  | They had lost more than a half-hour , Tania observed as she shined the samovar . The little brat had somehow gotten himself stuck in a room in the Omsk station and had been pounding on the doors , but everyone inside the station had run out to the platform to see what was happening . When a train was late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself . Delays always made her work harder . Up beyond Lake Baikal the stations were few and far between . Maybe the engineer would skip them if he saw no signs of passengers . She had just begun polishing the handrail below the window when the buzzer sounded from General Grivetsky 's compartment . Feeling the beat of her heart accelerate , she lightly tapped on his door . The lock snapped back and the door swung open . " Yes , sir ? " she asked . The general was wearing a silk robe and red slippers , and his hair , still damp from his bath , was neatly combed . He reminded her so much of Colonel Patushkin , her Colonel Patushkin . The general let her into the compartment , then resumed his seat , crossing his legs and picking up his cigar . It occurred to Tania that his bunk needed tidying , so she began to smooth the sheets and tuck them tightly around the edges of the mattress .  | " When you finish there I 'd like some tea , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blowing smoke toward the ceiling . " Of course , sir , " she said . She felt his presence , his closeness , and she was relieved that he had returned to his compartment , to her care . The morning she had discovered that the general had not slept in his bunk , she had become frightened , wondering if he had left the train . His clothes were still there , but that only increased her anxiety . People who disappeared often left belongings behind . But then , one of the attendants in the hard section told her about the chess marathon going on in her carriage . From her description of the players , Tania recognized the general , and was elated to know he was safe . Later that day , seized by a wild , mischievous urge , she let herself Into his compartment and snapped the lock shut from the inside . She had sprayed the room earlier , but she could still detect the delicious aroma of his cigar smoke and , closing her eyes , she recalled her first sight of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it herself , imagining that she could still feel his warmth along the back and seat . Then , seeing the garment bags , she unzipped one and removed the crisp uniform , holding it up in front of her , marveling at the polish of the buttons and its wonderfully clean smell . She hung it on a hook and watched it for a few moments , picturing the general dressing himself in it , feeling a surge of pleasure at the image . Then the jumped up suddenly . The chess game might be ending at any moment . She started to replace the uniform in the garment bag , discovering in the process that the bag was actually inside out . Shaking her head , she reversed the bag , enjoying the idea that she was bringing some domestic order to the general 's life . Then she had quietly let herself out of the compartment . She knew the general 's eyes were on her now as she tidied the place , then moved out to the samovar . She dared to imagine that there was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still feel the strength and warmth of his hand as they had dashed together to reach the train . Moments like that brought closeness , she told herself , and she poured a glass of tea , set some cookies and sugar on a little plate and returned to the compartment .  | " Thank you , Tania , " the general said , his eyes level with hers as she bent to put the tea beside him on the table . " If there is anything , anything at all , sir , " she paused , " it will be my pleasure . " " Thank you , Tania , " the general said again , sipping the hot tea cautiously . She wondered if her words had delivered the message of her feelings . What is he thinking ? she wondered . Can he sense what I feel ? In the passageway she continued to polish the window rail , moving in the direction of the samovar . When she had finished , she put the rag in a bucket , mentally calculating that she had finished tidying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ginzburgs ' . She knocked on the door of the Jewish couple 's compartment . She heard shuffling about inside and imagined that someone was breathing just beyond the steel door . " Can I help you ? " she called . " Go away , " a man 's voice said . She shrugged and obeyed , wondering whether she should ask the doctor about the woman 's health . It was , after all , the duty of the train attendant to know what was going on among her passengers . She started toward the doctor 's compartment , then hesitated . She knew what was going on inside . It was impossible to hide . Clues were everywhere : the blotches of stiffness on the sheets and blankets , the odd angle at which the mattress lay on the bunk , the familiar odors and , of course , the embarrassed glances , the change in routine . The doctor and the blonde lady had not left their compartment once during the entire second day . They had n't even ordered tea . She looked at her wristwatch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They would be in Novosibirsk in two hours . Perhaps that would be the moment to make inquiries of the doctor . She decided to work on the toilet , and began washing out the inside of the bowl . She stopped to light a cigarette . Smoking was against the rules , so she closed the door , leaving it open just a crack so she could keep an eye on the passageway . After a few minutes she heard the familiar click of a compartment door . Through the tiny opening she could see a flash of flowered material . It paused in her field of vision , rustled , then moved . She pushed the door open a bit more , watching as Mrs. Valentinov stood  | for a moment in the passageway , hesitating . Suddenly the red-haired man emerged from the compartment next door , silently crept up behind , and grabbed her around the waist , putting a hand over her mouth . In a moment the two disappeared into his compartment . Tania sucked in her breath , sorry that she had seen anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell what she had seen and her future , even her life , might depend on the reliability of her information . They might even test her . She noted the time , the exact moment ; fixed the train exactly ; made note of her own movements . She was even careful to observe the condition of the toilet and the angle at which she had seen the woman . Then she went back to her own compartment , slamming the door loud enough to wake the old crone who lay asleep on her bunk . The old woman 's snoring sputtered to a halt . Her eyes flickered open . " Is it time ? " she whispered hoarsely . " No . " " Is anything wrong ? " " No . It is only seven o'clock . " Then Tania began to run the water , soaping her hands and rubbing them clean . Satisfied that she had established her whereabouts with a witness , she went to the door and peered out cautiously in either direction . The stocky man with the funny walk had pulled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cloudless night . As she returned to the toilet to finish her work , Tania wondered whether Mrs. Valentinov had returned to her compartment , but knew that if she had not , she would not do so as long as the stocky man was still in the passageway . After finishing up in the toilet , Tania started toward the samovar again , but as she passed the doctor 's compartment , he opened the door and looked out in either direction . It had been about an hour since Mrs. Valentinov had disappeared . " May I help you , Doctor ? " she volunteered quickly , sensing that Mrs. Valentinov had not yet returned . " No , thank you , " the doctor said . His hair was tousled , as if he had just awakened . He seemed preoccupied . " Have you looked in again on Mrs. Ginzburg ? " " Huh ? " He seemed confused .  | " The woman in the end compartment . " In spite of his preoccupation , Alex 's mind turned to what she was saying . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they did not get off at Omsk ? " " No . " " That woman needs hospitalization . " " Mr. Ginzburg has n't been out of his compartment . He has not even let me in to tidy up . " " You think there is some problem ? " He ran his fingers through his tousled hair . " Yes , I do . " She hoped this new subject would take his mind off Mrs. Valentinov 's whereabouts . The doctor looked tentatively up and down the passageway again . The funny squat man shifted restlessly in the spring seat , a brief frown of pain clouding his face . If only I could get him to move , she thought . " I suppose I should look in , " the doctor said , ducking back into the compartment and emerging again with his medical kit . Tania led the way down the passage , stopping at the Ginzburg compartment and knocking softly . She knew there would be no answer . Looking at the doctor , she shrugged and knocked again , this time with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She knocked harder . " Go away , " a voice said from inside . " It 's the doctor , " Tania said . " Everything is fine . Please go away . " The doctor moved closer to the door . " Has her fever gone down ? " he asked . " Yes , " the voice said . " Are you sure ? " " Yes . " " I think you had better let me take a look , " the doctor said gently . " Please go away , " Ginzburg said , but a note of hesitation had crept into his voice . " Can you open the compartment from the outside ? " the doctor asked . " I have a master key , " Tania replied . " Really , there is no need , " the voice in the compartment pleaded .  | " Please , Mr. Ginzburg , " the doctor said , " if you value your wife 's life , I would suggest you open the door . " There was a long pause . Ginzburg was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lock clicked and the compartment door was opened . The doctor pushed it with his fingers and it gave way at his touch . Tania followed in behind him . Ginzburg was unshaven and his face lookd thinner . His eyes seemed to have sunk into their sockets . He stood aside and , sitting down in the chair , put his face in his hands . Mrs. Ginzburg was lying in the upper bunk , her eyes glazed . The doctor put his hand on her forehead . " She 's burning up , " he said . " I told you that she needed hospitalization . " " She would n't go , " Ginzburg said , removing his hands from his face . The doctor took his stethoscope from his kit and began to warm it in his hands . Then , undoing the woman 's robe , he listened to her chest . " It is much worse , " he said . " She would n't go , " the man repeated , distraught . " That is absurd . You have no choice . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " No , " the woman said weakly from the upper bunk , trying to sit up . " I want to go back to Moscow . " " Of course , " the doctor said gently . " But first you must get well . " " I must go back to Moscow . " The doctor turned to Ginzburg . " You must make arrangements at the next stop , " he told him . Tania edged backward and opened the compartment door , glancing into the passageway . With a sigh of relief , she saw that it was empty . The funny squat man had disappeared . " What is the next stop ? " the doctor asked . " There is a small country stop in about an hour , " Tania answered . " Then comes Novosibirsk . " " Fine . I 'm told they have good medical facilities there . It should not be difficult to make arrangements . " " For Jews everything is difficult , " Ginzburg moaned . " I am not Jewish , " the sick woman said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the doctor said , patting her thin arm . " I am not Jewish , " the woman repeated .  | " Please , Vera , " Ginzburg pleaded . " I 'm sure it wo n't be as difficult as you assume , " the doctor said . " How could you know , Doctor ? " Ginzburg said , his lips tightening . " Do I have your word ? " the doctor said , putting a hand on the man 's shoulder . Ginzburg lowered his head . " Do I have your word ? " the doctor repeated . The man nodded . The doctor looked up again at the sick woman . Tears were running down her cheeks . " You must rest , " he said . With that , he snapped the kit shut and left the compartment . Tania followed him . " Will she die ? " she asked . " She is very bad . " The doctor paused at the door of his compartment . " You have not seen Mrs. Valentinov ? " Tania walked away , pretending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then let himself into his compartment .  | Days and nights had begun to blur in Alex 's mind , his rhythm shattered by this remarkable passion . Like Jonah in the whale , he was trapped in an environment totally foreign to his experience . He knew that the train was moving relentlessly forward , over a bouncing ribbon of steel , through the endless taiga , over bridges of concrete and stone and wood , through the blackness of tunnels . He knew there was movement , but he could not feel it . What he felt was an intensity that shattered his sense of time and space , a heat generated within himself and focused , like a single magnified dot of fire , on the body and soul of Anna Petrovna . In her embrace he had reached the outer bounds of tenderness and passion . He felt the danger , too , but he dismissed it from his thoughts . Hardly anything mattered except the " now " of this consuming wonder . It was not uncommon to feel most alive on the threshold of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It did not matter to him how Anna Petrovna fit into Dimitrov 's equation . All that was merely their other lives , and now they had passed through a dark tunnel to the white light of the other side . " It is beyond my understanding , " he admitted as they half-lay ,  | half-sat crosswise across the lower bunk , their bare legs stretched across the carpet . He looked out the window deep into the taiga , wishing that it would be more endless than it was , that the world would suddenly stop on its axis . " All my life , " he said , feeling the need to plumb his own depth , " all my life , I have considered known quantities . I have used my curiosity , the scientific method , but I have never been up against a mystery like this before . This sudden attraction between us  --  I ca n't explain it ; I ca n't even examine it . My old habit of curiosity seems useless , even wrong , in the face of this . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said drowsily . " It will destroy your work . " " I have been up against mysteries before . " " Oh ? " " But of the blood only . Why , for example , does the white corpuscle suddenly develop odd tendencies ? It is an enigma within an enigma . " " If you lose your curiosity , you wo n't care why the white corpuscle behaves as it does . You will just accept it . And that would be a terrible catastrophe for the future of the human race . " " Who knows if it has a future ? " She put a finger on his lips . " It must have a future . " " That 's the historian talking . " " If I believed that there would be no future , why would I bother to study the past ? " " Study the present . There is enough nuclear energy poised on launching pads to destroy the whole world ten times over , and all your history with it . " He felt her stiffen , then shiver . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up around their shoulders . " You are frightening me . " " I 'm sorry . " She remained silent for a long time . Then she said firmly , " We Russians will never start the holocaust . " " Nor will we Americans . " " I hope not . " " You sound so tentative . " " We did not drop the first bombs . "  | " You would have if you could . " " Never . " " How can you be so sure ? " It was rushing back at him now , Dimitrov , bigger than life size . They were all helpless in the face of that man 's private thirst for power , for immortality . " We are a family , " Anna Petrovna said . " Because of that we have more control over our destiny . Our lives are built on comradeship , on sharing . " " You believe that ? " She turned and kissed him on the neck . " I tell myself to believe that . " " You 're denying your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Of all the countries in the world , you have spilled more of your own people 's blood , have brutalized your own people with such passion that it 's a wonder you 're still under one national umbrella . " He wondered if he had gone too far . He was no expert on the subject of Russian history . What he knew he had learned more by osmosis than by design . He looked down at her tousled blonde hair , noting that the roots were as blonde as the ends . He pressed his lips to her head . But she was absorbed in her thoughts . " We are a big country with big excesses . We are no more brutish than the rest of the human race . Surely , as a scientist , you know the lessons of the evolutionary process . Only the strong hold the land , and he who holds the land survives . You 're a Siberian . " She laughed . " You must understand that . The land is everything . Without the land there is nothing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tendons of her neck tighten . " You can only see that , " she said , " when you live on the edge of extinction . " " Extinction ? " She sat up and looked at him , her eyes flaming above her high cheekbones like smoldering ashes come to life . Smoothing the blankets between them , she pointed a finger and drew imaginary lines . " There are more than four thousand miles of Chinese border . The day will come when all along this border there will be missiles poised to destroy us . At this moment there are only a few , and their range is  | small . But soon the range will be unlimited . Now they can probably destroy only parts of Siberia and , perhaps , the western underbelly of the Soviet Union . Soon , very soon , they will be able to destroy all of us . Here , right here , good Dr. Cousins , lies the fate of the world . " She looked at him , eyes still blazing , waiting for a response . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changed colors , like a chameleon . Was she an agent of Dimitrov ? How much did she know ? Then he saw the lines of her face soften , the hard surface of her fanaticism disintegrate , and she was herself again . He remembered the evening he had sat quietly with Dimitrov , playing chess in a corner of his bedroom . " Even paranoids have enemies , " said Dimitrov suddenly , breaking half an hour of silence . " What ? " Alex had responded with some confusion . It was , after all , a statement in limbo . " I must be quick , " Dimitrov said . Clearly his thoughts were not pleasant ones . Then , shaking himself like an old dog , he stood up , a sign that Alex was dismissed . It had , of course , been just one more piece in the puzzle , fitting into place in his mind at the right moment . Anna Petrovna slumped back against the bunk , her fingers intertwining with his . " I am much too serious , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her breath soft , like a warm tropical breeze . He felt his body stir again . " Apparently it 's another national trait . " " What is ? " " This fast swing between joy and depression . My grandfather was a perfect example . Sometimes he would tell a joke , roar with laughter , then almost immediately disintegrate into tears . " " The Russian soul . " " Is that what it is ? " he teased . " In all joy there is sadness . " He let go of her fingers and felt them begin to roam over his body , coming to rest on his penis , which hardened to her touch . " Now there is mystery , " she said . As if to counterpoint his body 's involuntary response , he reached for her nipples , felt their hardness . " Another mystery , " he said , leaning over and biting them gently .  | She drew one of his hands down and moved it between her legs . " And still another . " She bent over him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compartment . She kissed his chest , her hair brushing lightly against his skin as she nipped at him , moving downward over him languorously . Again , he felt the pressure of time , as if Dimitrov 's obsession had suddenly taken possession of him . Then she was kneeling between his legs , kissing him gently , her lips roaming , her tongue searching out every nerve end of pleasure as his hands played through her hair . Her body quivered beside his thighs as he stroked her , then , feeling her longing , he lifted her , moving her upward as she spread her body to receive him . They stayed joined for a long moment . His body lay suspended in happiness . Then , with a will beyond his control , he felt his pleasure come . Later , he could not tell how much later , since he had lost his sense of time , he felt her moving around him . Struggling up from sleep , he heard material rustling , odd movements , breathing , a sudden change of sound . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the compartment was empty . He reached out to where Anna Petrovna 's body had been wedged against his , feeling the warmth where she had been . She must have slipped out , he thought , stretching his legs . It was dark and he could not see the face of his watch , not that it would have mattered , since it was still running on Moscow time . Putting his hands behind his head , he looked up at the bottom side of the upper bunk , listening to the rush of wind against the steel and glass of the carriage . They were moving deep into Eastern Siberia now , into the wilderness of his grandfather 's memories . He could even recall the pitch and timbre of his grandfather 's voice , deep , resonant , strong even to the very moment of his death , which Alex had witnessed , standing beside the high , pillowed bed . It was a frosty morning in midwinter , and his grandfather had turned his ashen face to the window where two glistening icicles hung from the eaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gnarled hand and pointing . That had been his last word and , like all the others before it , it was an umbilical cord connected to his past .  | Etape ! Alex could not remember when he had first heard the word , but it had always epitomized , for him , his grandfather 's obsession . Remembering it now , he sprang out of bed and pressed his head against the icy window , peering into the blackness . He knew exactly what he was searching for , could see it in his imagination , feel the horror of it , the degradation and despair . " Etapes , " his grandfather had explained , were way stations which dotted the thousand-mile journey from Omsk to Irkutsk . They were miserable , foul-smelling shelters built by the Czars at intervals of from twenty-five to forty miles . Parties of three to four hundred prisoners of every description  --  including women and children , political exiles , thieves and murderers , and those like his grandfather , simply banished by administrative order  --  were expected to make the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by forty soldiers , they snaked their way ponderously over the permafrost and through dirt roads cut into the taiga to the transfer prisons of Irkutsk . Every day they were subjected to unbearable hardships . But worst of all , his grandfather assured him , were the nights spent in the &tapes.; Men , women and children , hopeless , cold , tired , hungry , would crowd into the long , low , airless building , still reeking with the stink of prisoners who had passed that way before them . His grandfather left out no detail , painting the picture with Brueghel 's eye and burning the image on Alex 's mind . He could smell the excrement bucket overflowing in a great horrible puddle on the permafrost floor . Since the prisoners were locked into the &tape; for the night , the bucket could not be emptied or removed . Sometimes his grandfather would gag on the description . Alex heard the low moans of the sick and the maimed . Cries of children urging themselves upon their exhausted mothers who were locked in a dead sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Men and women reaching for each other in the darkness for a moment of escape . The hardened criminals who threw the weaker of the group from the choice sleeping spots along the long low platform . It was so unbearable that desperate escape attempts were frequent , all doomed to failure since all prisoners were forced to wear leg fetters . His grandfather 's scars never completely faded , and Alex had  | seen them when the body was removed from the bed by the undertaker . Now , years later , those scars were the proof that it had really happened . He had never put the question to his grandfather , but he had always wondered . Three months along that endless , bleak landscape . As he watched it now from the train window , he felt even more strongly that it was beyond the imagination . His grandfather must have invented it . Such cruelty was not possible . All his grandfather 's stories , taken together , formed the catalogue of an obsession . Alex could understand why it had been necessary for his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as a young man in the uniform of a United States Army lieutenant . Alex had found in himself the same compulsion , which had brought him here by chance , actually against his will . Would the chain end with him ? he wondered . His own daughter seemed permanently indifferent . " Not again , Daddy . Not all that stuff about olden days . " It was a sign of a breach in the continuum , he thought . An intensity , passed down through his family 's seed until now , had been lost , and he blamed it on Janice , whose view of life was so different from his own . He began to long for Anna Petrovna again . He measured her absence , not in time , but rather in yearning , as hunger growing inside of him . Putting on his pajama top and slacks , he opened the compartment door and looked out the passageway in either direction . He saw the younger attendant come toward him with a look of consternation , and soon he was standing in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his concentration again . She was much worse , and it annoyed him that he had forgotten to look in on her as he had promised . But then , he had been certain that the Ginzburgs would have had the good sense to leave the train at Omsk . This time he would take no chances . He would see that they got off at Novosibirsk . There was obviously some terrible problem between them , having somehow to do with the husband 's Jewishness , but he could not get involved , he told himself , slipping into the discipline of withdrawal that had been his weapon for so many years . For a moment he stood before the door of his compartment , half hoping that Anna Petrovna might appear at the door . But the  | compartment was empty , just as he had left it . It seemed as if she had been gone for hours . Perhaps she was in the restaurant carriage , he thought . She was wearing a housecoat , but women were always parading around the train that way . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain that his redheaded shadow would soon spring out from nowhere to take up position behind him . But he did not appear . Alex stood for a minute in the glare of the half-empty restaurant carriage . He did not see Anna Petrovna . " Is anything wrong , Dr. Cousins ? " a voice said . It was Miss Peterson , looking relaxed and benign as she sat , a plate of greasy stew before her , at the first table in the carriage . " No , nothing , " he said quickly , forcing a smile . " You are welcome to join me . " " Thank you . " He hesitated . " Have you seen Mrs. Valentinov ? " he asked . " Who ? " " That tall blonde lady . " " No , I have n't , " she said , a brief frown creasing her forehead . She looked at him and smiled . " Come join me for a glass of tea . This stew is beyond the possibility of consumption . " " Not right now , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard-class carriages , glancing quickly through each open compartment door . In one compartment he saw a heavy woman slipping into a skirt . She looked at him angrily and slammed the door . A crowd was gathered in another compartment and he looked in hopefully . But it was only a chess game . He moved on , feeling an urge to shout Anna Petrovna 's name at the top of his lungs . Where could she be ? he wondered , opening the next door with some trepidation , since he knew he had already reached the last car . The heavy face of a Russian soldier confronted him . " You can not pass , " he said arrogantly . " Have you seen a tall blonde lady in a flowered housecoat ? " he said . The young soldier looked at him as if he were crazy .  | " I 'm sorry , " Alex said , moving back into the passageway feeling like an idiot . As he turned , he saw the face of the red-haired man , impassive as ever , but somehow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he thought . He knows everything . Alex walked faster , determined to confront him , but the man suddenly moved away with equal speed , disappearing down the passageway . These people are all crazy , Alex thought , pushing through the crowd that was gathered around the chess players . Up ahead he saw the door between the carriages slide shut . Following quickly , he reached the icy chamber and gripped the metal handle to open the door ahead . He felt the wrench in his shoulder as the door stuck , refused to budge . He pulled hard , with all his strength . It would not move . Gripping the metal handle with both hands , he wedged one of his feet against the door jamb and tugged . Still the door would not move . He stepped back , pushing his bruised and frozen fingers into the waistline of his pants for warmth . He kicked at the door and hammered on it with his fists . " Open the damned door , " he shouted , knowing that his voice would be lost in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold and pain in his hands , he calmed himself . After all , sooner or later someone would have to pass through the stuck door . But after a few minutes , the cold proved too much for him . His lips chattered , his shins trembled . The cold seemed to seep into his nerve ends and bone marrow . Finally he yielded to the discomfort and let himself into the carriage he had just left , searching for the attendant while he warmed his frozen hands on the coals of the samovar . The attendant was nowhere to be seen in the crowded passageway and the group bunched around the chess game were chattering noisily . Farmer , the British diplomat , emerged from the crowd and came toward him . " He 's done it again , old chap . Simply marvelous . " He looked down at Alex 's hands . " I say , how did you do that ? " " The damned door is locked in the carriage ahead . " " Now there 's a mystery , old boy . "  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the door , bending down and feeling below the handle . Then he came back inside . " There 's no triplock there , " he reported . " Only a keyhole . " " The mechanism may have frozen , " Alex volunteered , rubbing the blood back into his fingers . " The best way to cope with this part of the world , old boy , is to suspend your sense of Western logic , " Farmer said , puffing delicately on his cigarette , and blowing the smoke upward from a puckered lower lip . His eyes crinkled and the bow tie jumped below his Adam 's apple as he talked . He looked a lot like Basil Rathbone , Alex thought , comforted by his easy self-assurance . The man was a calming influence . Alex felt his anxiety diminish . Surely , Anna Petrovna was back in their compartment , perhaps anxious about his own whereabouts . " The Russians are a mass of contradictions . " Farmer was warming up to his subject . " Capable of all sorts of excesses . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When they are sad , it 's a massive state of depression . When they are angry , it 's a tantrum . Everything is an excess . Love . Hate . Suspicion . When it comes to suspicion , they are absolutely beyond comprehension . They think of themselves as a healthy body about to be besieged by a pack of enemy viruses . Do n't you think so ? " Is he trying to tell me something ? Alex wondered . Or trying to get me to tell him something ? Looking up , he saw an attendant coming toward them , a fat , almost slovenly creature with a morbid look about her . He felt his moment of closeness with the diplomat pass . " The door to the next carriage is stuck , " Alex told her , in as neutral a tone as he could manage . The attendant looked at them both , tight-lipped and contemptuous . " How do you know ? " she asked with a sneer . " Try it yourself . " She watched them for a moment , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked at Alex and shook her head , as if he were a child who had broken it deliberately . " She is rather annoyed with us , " the diplomat said . " She thinks we did it to confound her . " As he spoke they felt the train begin to slow down as they  | reentered the carriage . Within a few moments it was clanking to a crawl . " A country stop , " the diplomat said . " Probably for less than five minutes . " The sour-looking attendant bore down on them , a toolbox swinging in her hand . They followed her into the space between the carriages as the train continued to slow , edging its way through the taiga . Watching over the woman 's head , Alex could not make out any breaks in the trees . Then , as if it were an apparition , a dimly lit platform came into view . Huddled there was a single female figure , wrapped in a heavy coat with the collar drawn over her ears and a kerchief on her head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her face was briefly illuminated . She looked cold and lonely . Then Alex 's car went by , but he could still look back and see her , an unvanquished figure in the emptiness . She is Siberia , he thought , the image of her imprinted on his mind . As the train stopped , the woman attendant grabbed her toolbox and swung herself to the ground , opening the outside door to the next carriage and hoisting herself up . Alex and the British diplomat followed . As Alex hit the ground , his attention was caught by a sudden movement up ahead . A robed figure half-jumped , half-fell from one of the carriage entrances and began moving hesitantly toward the little shack that served as the station . Anna Petrovna , he thought , his heart jumping as he ran toward the faltering figure . He could hear his shoes pounding the hard ground . Faces in the lighted restaurant carriage turned toward him , gaping . As he ran , he saw another figure leap from the train and begin running toward the robed woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of metal fencing . " Anna Petrovna , " he cried , but the words were swallowed even as uttered them . It was not Anna Petrovna . He recognized , instead , the sick woman he had treated on the train . When he reached her , she had already collapsed in her husband 's arms and was gasping for breath . " I was only gone a moment , " Ginzburg cried . " You had better get her aboard , " Alex commanded . She had a raging fever . The wheels of the train were already turning as he hoisted himself  | aboard and helped Ginzburg lift the woman into the carriage . Together they laid her gently in the bunk . Alex felt her pulse , a faint beat against his fingers , and put his head against her chest . " She is leaving us , " he said . " Please , Vera ! " Ginzburg cried , pulling her to him , tears streaming down his cheeks . " I ca n't bear it . " The woman opened her eyes , sunk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left her . " Vera , " Ginzburg pleaded , " forgive me . Forgive me . " The words seemed an incantation . " I am not a Jew , " the woman gasped , lurching forward , the last tremor of life departing as her head fell back . The coming of death was a common experience for Alex , but it never failed to stir him . His first impulse was to place the blame , to establish Ginzburg 's guilt for this death that might have been avoided . But the man knew his own guilt , and his agony was beyond simple grief . He was moaning now , an incoherent Hebrew prayer . Alex lifted Vera 's limp arm to confirm her death officially , then , in a practiced gesture , he pushed her lids down over the staring eyes . He touched Ginzburg 's shoulder , then backed out of the compartment . Tania was waiting in the passageway . " Mrs. Ginzburg has died , " he told her . " What must be done ? I do n't know how you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the body at Novosibirsk . " " Tough go , " the diplomat said . He had also been waiting in the passageway . Then he paused . " Jews ? " " Yes , " Alex replied . It seemed too complicated to explain . " It never ends for them . " " If I 'm needed , Tania , let me know , " Alex said . " It 's best that Mr. Ginzburg be left alone for awhile . " " Of course . " He made his way back to his compartment . It was dark , but he could tell by the faint aroma of the familiar perfume that Anna Petrovna had returned .  | Zeldovich 's impatience had turned to frustration and instead of giving him a lift , the quantities of vodka he had consumed only depressed him more . He sat in the chair of his compartment only a few feet from Dr. Cousins , but still he had not obtained the information that he required . To make matters worse he had to share the compartment with Yashenko , who rarely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head , rolled a swallow of vodka on his tongue , and cursed his fate , his age , his vulnerable position . Soon I will be fifty , he told himself , feeling the vodka slide down the back of his throat . He had fastened himself to Dimitrov twenty years ago , had lapped at his ass like a groveling dog to prove his loyalty , had groped to the stratosphere of power , always at Dimitrov 's beck and call . Selfpity washed over him like a hot wave . " Can we trust him ? " That was Dimitrov 's refrain , to which he returned whenever a new face appeared in the picture . " Can we trust him ? " It was Zeldovich 's job to find out  --  to make the judgment , and to be right . So far he always had been , and he had built his little empire , a KGB within the KGB , on the corpses of a thousand careers . He was the most feared man in the Soviet bureaucracy . Dimitrov had  | never called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christian name , no personality of his own . Fyodor Petrovich , you bloody bastard  --  that 's also my name , he had wanted to scream . How he hated that man to whom he owed everything ! " Can we trust him , Zeldovich ? " " No . " " Then dump him somewhere . " " Of course . " The rivers flowed with the blood they had shed , and now the bastard was going to abandon him to the vultures who would pick his carcass and leave his bones in the desert . He had watched Dimitrov 's energy wane , the once ruddy face turn pale , the strong , well-fleshed frame begin to wither . It was Zeldovich who had arranged for the tests , confounding the doctors and clinicians so that they could never trace the true identity of the patient . " Whoever has this disease is a cooked goose , " one of the doctors had told him , not daring to inquire about the patient 's identity , not even daring to think the unthinkable . And then this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in twenty years , Dimitrov had kept his own counsel . Does n't he trust me anymore ? Zeldovich wondered , jealous and uncertain . But whatever the doctor had done , whatever magic potion he had poured into Dimitrov 's bloodstream , it had done the trick . The eyes glistened again with their old fire . The color rose in the cheeks . The question that ate at Zeldovich , like acid in his entrails , was : For how long ? How much time did Kuznetzov 's magic potion provide for General Secretary Dimitrov ? He had tried to pry the answer out of the doctor , but with no success . And that was only the first question . As Zeldovich knew , all questions were open-ended , leading only to other questions . That had been the prime discipline of the KGB , drummed into his brain when he was a young agent . Answers lead only to other questions . Other questions lead only to more answers and other questions . And there was this mysterious matter with Grivetsky , mysterious only because it had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's mission . But why had Dimitrov kept the confidence from him ? In one way , all the questions were the same . At their core was fear ,  | blind , raging fear . Dimitrov had begun it . He had taunted Zeldovich with the possibility . " What will become of you , Zeldovich , if I were to check out ? " " Check out ? " " Croak . " " God knows , " he had replied , the possibility beginning to reveal itself in Dimitrov 's glazed look . " God knows ? Zeldovich , we buried Him long ago . " " I had n't thought about it . " " Take a gun to your head , Zeldovich , " Dimitrov had said , watching him , as if he were jealous of his health . " They will tear you apart like an overcooked chicken . " " Well then , you had best not check out . " Dimitrov had nodded . " I am not over yet . " But Zeldovich had developed strategies for survival before . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a way to survive after the old man 's death . He had already toyed with a thousand different ways . When he had first pieced together the nature of Dimitrov 's illness , he had pondered the idea of killing him . It would be quite simple , a vial of poison dumped into his soup , a little change in his medicine dosage . The problem was deciding in advance who would be the winners in the contest for succession . Then he would simply confront them and put his plans on the table . But whom could he trust ? And , besides , as Dimitrov 's killer he would be a pariah . Even if his faction won out , they would eliminate him as quickly as the other side would . He needed something far more subtle , a scheme that would leave him straddling all camps , a centipede with one foot in every territory . In trying to assemble the pieces floating in his head , he had decided that , like Dimitrov , he was running a race against time and he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He sensed that the most important starting point for his own campaign of survival was to know exactly how long Dimitrov would live , a timetable locked in the mind of the American doctor . Such knowledge was a golden nugget , valuable enough , perhaps , to buy back his own life . And then there was Grivetsky . The general had come to the dacha more often lately , always arriving under the tightest security . Zeldovich had begun to wonder if Bulgakov knew about these visits .  | He dared not ask Dimitrov , but he filed the information for future use . The reason for these meetings with Grivetsky was perfectly transparent , of course , at least to Zeldovich . " Do they think I will actually negotiate with the Chinks ? " Dimitrov had said to Zeldovich more than once . " What fools ! " Zeldovich himself had no such illusion , but he knew that the other members of the Politburo , as well as Bulgakov , believed it . " I will make a Chinese stew , before that moment ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But knowing that secret was useless until he also knew the timetable . He had only one-half the puzzle . When he knew what the American doctor knew , he could present both halves of the puzzle in a neat package to Bulgakov and somehow receive amnesty in return . " You must arrange for the doctor 's return to America , " Dimitrov had ordered . He had not even looked up from his desk , although Zeldovich had sensed a hesitation . " By train . " " Train ? " Zeldovich was alert . " To the East , " Dimitrov had continued . " The East ? " " The Trans-Siberian , " Dimitrov had said , looking up at last . " It is my gift to him . " " That trip , a gift ? I see . " The doctor was , after all , of Siberian extraction . " He has done wonders for you , Comrade . " Dimitrov ignored the remark . He knows I am probing , Zeldovich thought . " I want him protected thoughout the journey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you must go with him . " " Me ? " " I can trust no one else , " Dimitrov said , his eyes boring into Zeldovich . " And he must not know you are there . " Zeldovich sensed that the Secretary wished to say more , but hesitated . " And you must find a way to restrict his communications . " So he is suspected of knowing something , Zeldovich thought . " Grivetsky " ? Dimitrov cleared his throat ? " General Grivetsky will also be on board . "  | Zeldovich understood instantly . " The doctor will journey to Nakhodka and take the boat to Japan . " " And then ? " Zeldovich felt his tension increase . Dimitrov clenched his fists , a sure sign of uncertainty . " It is a dangerous journey . The crossing is rough . Many a passenger has fallen overboard . " Zeldovich said nothing , afraid he would betray his agitation . " But you must stay in touch , " Dimitrov said , with an air of finality . " I may need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside Zeldovich 's head . Dimitrov is still uncertain about his health . " And Zeldovich , " Dimitrov called as he walked to the door . He could tell from the voice 's urgency that this was not an afterthought , more an underlining of what had , up to now , been unspoken . " Protect him well , " Dimitrov said haltingly , wanting to be understood , but afraid to articulate his meaning plainly . " Yes , of course , " Zeldovich said . " He holds important knowledge . " That was , of course , the unspoken thought . Would Dimitrov see it as a probe ? " Yes . " Dimitrov nodded . " I imagine his knowledge would be in great demand . " " I understand , " Zeldovich said , turning to go . But Dimitrov held him . " Do not try to understand too much , " he said . It was , of course , a warning . It came to him . The doctor possessed two bits of knowledge ! The China strike as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long did Dimitrov have to live ? That was the key to Zeldovich 's own survival . How could one pry this knowledge out of the doctor 's head during a seven-day journey ? There were hundreds of ways to unlock information from the human brain . Some were blatantly mechanical  --  physical or psychological torture , the use of sophisticated truth-inducing drugs , all impossible under the present circumstances . Other methods were far more subtle . The exploitation of weakness , emotional hunger , sexual inducements , the temptations of the flesh and spirit . But the doctor had not betrayed much about himself at  | the dacha , although there was that little . episode with the nurse . Zeldovich racked his brains , rattling restlessly through the halls of the dacha , taking long walks along the river . He had a week to work out the problem . Under any other circumstances , it would have been quite simple . Simply snatch the doctor off the train , shoot him with sodium pentothal , get the information and be done with it . In Stalin 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ testicles and thrown the switch until he begged to be allowed to talk . In his room at the dacha , Zeldovich lay on his bed and watched the ceiling swim as he sucked on his nightly vodka bottle and felt his world breaking into little pieces , nightmare images that no amount of alcohol could defend against . Anna Petrovna Valentinov had emerged as a potential instrument out of his own desperation . He had called Bogach , the Chief of the Guards Directorate of the KGB , whose appointment Zeldovich had made possible . " It is a rather odd request , Nikolai Andreyivich , " Zeldovich had said on the telephone , his tone deliberately tinged with self-effacing humor . " A beautiful , intelligent , sensitive woman . Not one of those floozy types that are used to compromise those who are too weak to discipline themselves . This is a special need . You must ask your people to search carefully and it must , somehow , be kept out of regular channels . " Bogach was businesslike and eager to please . He would try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had hung up the telephone , an absurd idea . The American doctor was simply not the type . Nothing in his dossier or in his conduct at the dacha indicated that such an idea was workable . But the incident with the nurse had somehow stuck in Zeldovich 's mind , the only bit of revealed information that just might provide the key to the doctor 's mind . Women could be formidable interrogators under the right circumstances . A hundred times he had decided to call the whole thing off . it was sheer nonsense , exposing himself to consequences perhaps worse than anything that might happen when Dimitrov died . But the more uncertain he became , the more he pressed Bogach . " Anything ? " he would ask , burning up the phone lines .  | " Not yet . " " You must work faster . " " I assure you ? " " Faster . " He could almost hear the whir of the computers as the clerks in the Registry and Archives division plumbed their categories , the massive lists of Soviet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some for money , some for patriotism , some for adventure . And then the call from Bogach came . He had come up with a single name  --  Anna Petrovna Valentinov . She met the requirements , except for one point : she had not worked for the KGB for ten years . She was at this moment in Moscow , at a seminar of history professors , and had made arrangements to return to her home in Irkutsk via the Trans-Siberian . She was staying at the faculty building at Moscow University . Zeldovich , who refused ever to write anything down , memorized her name and address . " She is marvelous-looking , " Bogach had crowed into the telephone , " with quite an impressive list of academic honors . " " And what has she done for us ? " " Surreptitious interrogation . Her file indicates that she was quite efficient , especially in the intellectual community . " At first Mrs. Valentinov had been adamant in her refusal . Bogach had arranged the meeting in her room at the faculty building , a whitewashed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She had refused to be seated , pacing the little space like a caged tigress . She was full-bodied , supple , intense , with an intelligence as striking as her appearance . In her presence , Zeldovich had felt bumbling and clumsy , more like a supplicant than the powerful KGB agent whose name could strike fear in the hearts of the nation 's most important leaders . " I 've done my share , " she insisted , not intimidated , as if she sensed her superiority over him . " This is a special assignment , " Zeldovich said . He was not good with women . The only way he could dominate them was by paying for the privilege . " It 's much different with me now . I ca n't pretend as well as I did then . Believe me , I know myself . When I was younger , I had more  | confidence in my own physical impression . I was vain enough about my looks to think I could do anything . Really , I do n't believe I can do the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he had asked , hoping that his words would hint at further intimidation . " Really , " she said , stopping her pacing , " it wo n't work . It has nothing to do with ideology , or lack of commitment to Marx and Lenin and to the society which we have evolved for ourselves . No . I refuse to be defensive . It 's just that I 'm no longer able to carry out the charade , whatever the circumstances . " She was the perfect agent , the perfect mixture of the soft and the hard , provocative yet subtle . He wanted her for the job , and made the decision to tell her more than he had planned , in order to persuade her . " It is a question of the Chinese . " " The Chinese ? " He had aroused her curiosity . She was , after all , from Irkutsk , where the Chinese horde was a living presence . Confrontations with the Chinese were not taken lightly in Irkutsk . He knew he had stoked the ashes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your city , of the whole of Eastern Siberia ? " He was embroidering now . " I do n't understand . " " If it meant the obliteration of all the humanity in that part of the world ? " Was he carrying it too far ? She had stopped her pacing , was suddenly looking pale . " What are you trying to say ? " " I must have your complete confidence , your total commitment to secrecy . " " Now really , Comrade . How else would I answer a KGB agent ? " " This is beyond the KGB . " " You are talking in circles . " " I have reason to believe that Comrade Dimitrov will within a short time provoke an armed confrontation with China . " " You mean we will start it . " " Either that or we will provoke them to fire the first missile . "  | " My God ! That 's madness . " She lit a cigarette and pushed the smoke out of both nostrils . " Dimitrov is dying . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unite all comrades under the Soviet umbrella . " " And are you sure he 's dying ? " " He has leukemia . " " That is terminal . " " If it were only that simple . It seems that an American doctor has treated him successfully with chemotherapy . We do n't know how long he has to live . " " You realize that this sounds like a fairy tale . " " I told you it was important . " " What am I supposed to do ? " She laughed , a high , nervous twitter . I am reaching her , he thought . " We must find a way to stop it . " " You want me to assassinate the General Secretary ? " she said sarcastically . " You 'd better curb your tongue , " he said severely , almost as a reflex . He watched her , saw the brief spark of fear flicker , then recede . " Think of your children , your family . Everything we have strived for . " " But we are far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course , win , if that is the correct definition of emerging from a conflict with thousands of square miles in total desolation , perhaps uninhabitable for years . " " Siberia ? " she asked , her eyes glistening . " Siberia has always been expendable to the Russians . It is , in their minds , the dump for their garbage . " " The bastards , " she hissed . He was sure he was reaching her now . She lifted her blue eyes to his face . " What can I do ? " she asked with determination . It was the one moment of elation that Zeldovich had experienced since the onset of Dimitrov 's illness . Later , in the car returning to the dacha , he felt gloomy again . It may not work , he thought . If it did , what would be the next step ? Whatever happened , she would have to be eliminated , he told himself without pity . What did one more matter ? Now they were all on the train , an interminable journey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barely touched the fatty sausages and dark bread that Yashenko had provided , and felt only a growing anxiety as he watched the boring landscape pass monotonously before him . Keeping out of Kuznetzov 's sight was not as simple as he had expected , and he was constantly confined to his compartment , where Yashenko was driving him crazy with his blank fawning stare and long stretches of silence . He thought of Grivetsky . Keeping an eye on him was fraught with potential danger . There was a tacit understanding among the top rank of the military and KGB that precluded the possibility of overt surveillance . Of course , they all knew it was an illusion , a game of mirrors , since they all watched each other in any case . He wondered if he , too , was being watched . Dimitrov was capable of anything now that he had decided to act . What galled him was the nature of the act , so untypical of Dimitrov whose modus operandi was never the frontal bold stroke . Zeldovich was frightened and because the emotion was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ differently . Even the requisition of an entire train of KGB guard troops provided by Bogach seemed an extension of his own fear . For a day or two he had amused himself with the electronic surveillance device that Yashenko had attached to the speaker in the doctor 's compartment . But the talk about Siberia , the sentimental flabbiness of the conversation only made him more impatient . He had not dared to monitor Grivetsky 's compartment . If the general discovered a surveillance device , he would set off a chain reaction that would go right up to Dimitrov and Zeldovich 's goose would be cooked . Instead , he had Yashenko keep an eye on Grivetsky and check up on him by questioning the railway personnel aboard the train . Zeldovich lay on his bunk , occasionally putting on the ear phones , imagining what might be taking place on the other side of the steel plating . Sometimes he napped , but his mind could not sleep for very long . It raced like a mouse on a treadmill , working out scenarios of survival . Suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ link had been broken . There was only one reason why : Anna Petrovna had simply cut him off . He swung out of the bunk and began to pace the compartment . He looked at his watch . They had passed through  | Omsk , where the delay had occurred , and they were heading toward Novosibirsk . " Bring Mrs. Valentinov to me at the first opportunity , " he had ordered Yashenko . Yashenko had whisked her into their compartment , grabbing her from behind with a hand over her mouth and an arm holding her in a vise around the waist . He stood , holding her that way in the compartment , waiting for a signal from Zeldovich as she struggled to break free . Zeldovich put a finger to his lips . She stopped squirming , and blinked her eyes in assent . Yashenko released her . " This was hardly necessary , " she said , brushing back her hair , straightening her housecoat and looking contemptuously into Yashenko 's dull , obedient face . " I 'm sorry , " Zeldovich said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and held out the vodka bottle . Anna Petrovna nodded and he poured out a tumblerful . " You must have more trust , Zeldovich , " she said , lifting her glass . " Trust ? " he said . " I was merely backing you up . " " Do you think I 'm an idiot , Zeldovich ? " " Of course not . " " Emotionally vulnerable ? Is that it ? " " It had n't occurred to me , " he said . Until now , he told himself . It was she who had raised that issue . There was no mistaking the sounds he had heard , before she had cut off the link . But emotion ? He had not thought in those terms . " What have you learned ? " Zeldovich asked , deliberately refocusing their conversation . " He is cautious . " " Of course . " " It is not so simple , " she said , after a long pause . " Do you think he suspects you ? " " Perhaps . He is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say more , but had checked herself . " The question remains , " she said . " What happens when we learn the truth ? How can we prevent a holocaust ? " He took a deep swallow from the vodka bottle . The holocaust was not his concern . What he cared about was his own survival . " We must take one step at a time , " he said . " We will know better  | how to proceed when we know how long Dimitrov will be with us . " " And then ? " " Others will need to know . " " And quickly . " " So you see why I am anxious , " he said , feeling the edge of his own cunning . " For all we know , there is no time left at all . " " You must n't get too impatient . There is a delicacy here . We are dealing with a sensitive man . There is , actually , some question whether he will ever tell us what we want to know . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that no quantity of vodka could erase . Perhaps he was being too subtle . Other methods might be far more effective . He took another swallow from the bottle . His eyes roved over the compartment . It was confining , maddening . Like Dimitrov , he craved space , big high-ceilinged rooms , a large scale . This confinement is killing me , he thought . Anna Petrovna looked out into the darkness . " We will be in Novosibirsk soon , " she said wistfully . " We are heading home . " " It is a godforsaken country , " Zeldovich said , shivering lightly . Hearing his own words , sensing her disapproval , he knew he had spoken rashly . " Forsaken ? " " I mean it is formidable , huge , an enigma . " He felt himself reaching for ways to placate her . " The future is here . " She stood up , then moved toward the door . " You will know when I know . And do n't send for me again . " She opened the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alone in the compartment , Zeldovich felt the full weight of his depression descend , and he emptied the vodka bottle to the dregs .  | Tania stood on the bottom step of the train carriage , gloved fingers wrapped tightly around the handhold as the lights of Novosibirsk glowed up ahead . The icy wind against her cheeks felt wonderful , and she waved to the crowd of babushkas who lined the tracks . She felt a great sense of her own importance as she stood there on the moving train , the old women 's faces looking up as if in tribute . She was sure they envied her . She was Cleopatra coming down the Nile , and these rows of babushkas were her subjects . In her free hand she could feel the paper rubles the general had given her . She would have declined this mission for anyone else , just as she had refused countless scores of passengers who asked for similar consideration . It was against the rules , although it was winked at even by the inspectors . But since they no longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do when the craving became oppressive ? For many of the attendants it was a regular business . They ducked off the train and went straight to the supplier , usually an ancient crone who bribed the police not to notice her as she stood in the shadows . Some attendants even stocked it in their quarters , stashing bottles in every spare bit of space . Tania found that unthinkable . But  | she was not against vodka . She always kept a bottle herself , and understood that , for the passengers , there was something about a train ride that seemed to induce drinking . What surprised her was how quickly she had agreed to the general 's request . Not the slightest quiver of protestation had occurred to her . It was as if she had been merely waiting for him to ask her for something , anything . She was happy to do this for the general , but she felt her mission to be an interruption of her efficiency . That made her nervous , for this was no ordinary , routine journey . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one compartment , and KGB men in another , on an active mission of surveillance . She had observed the blonde woman being carried bodily into their compartment . And then there was that little brat Vladimir , and the squat fellow who walked like a duck and never seemed to sit still . It was her duty to observe them all , and she wondered when she herself would be interrogated . As always , she was fully prepared . Suddenly she remembered one of her duties . The Jew , Ginzburg , had to get off at the next stop with the body of his wife . The general 's mission had driven the thought out of her head . Reentering the carriage , she knocked at the door of Ginzburg 's compartment , and the grief-stricken face of Ginzburg appeared , his skin ashen , his eyes puffed and bloodshot . " We will be in Novosibirsk in a few minutes . " He nodded . She looked beyond him into the compartment , hesitating , unwilling to enter . She imagined that the dead woman had already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the compartment as soon as possible . The very idea of death was offensive , the epitome of uncleanliness . " I 've asked the night attendant to help you , " she whispered , as if the sound of her voice might provoke a resurrection . Then she backed away and returned to the steps of the carriage . The platform filled with people as the vendors crowded toward the edge of the train , hawking their wares . Searching the shadows in the rear of the platform Tania saw an old woman , huddled in a huge coat , her unruly gray hair wrapped in a large babushka . Beside her was a pushcart , covered with canvas . Soldiers in the rear train jumped off , their guns slung over their tunics as they crowded around the women , some of them flirting with  | the few pretty girls among the peddlers . Without looking around , Tania moved toward the old woman . Pulling off her glove , she put up three fingers and counted out the correct number of rubles . Out of the boxes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly tucked under her coat . As she turned to depart , she was blocked by the big red-haired man , who stared impassively at her for a moment , then motioned to the old woman . Tania felt suddenly unnerved . Her knees began to shake as she ran toward the train without looking back . On the edge of hysteria , she hurried down the passageway and tapped frantically on the general 's door . " You 're as white as a sheet , " Grivetsky said , taking the bottles and lining them up on the table . She felt perspiration begin to pour from her armpits as she struggled to keep herself from trembling . " I 'm sorry , sir . " " Sorry ? " " He saw me , " she said , blurting the words out . Surely she could trust the general . He stood in the center of the compartment watching her , his handsome face showing concern . Being with him calmed her . She felt suddenly under his protection . " Who saw you ? " " KGB , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red-haired man . He must have followed me . " " Did he say anything ? " " He did n't have to . He just looked at me . I know he will report me . " " I doubt that . " " I know them , " Tania said . " They can make it hot for you . " " It 's me they 're watching , " the general said , smashing a fist into his hand . " This train is infested with them . " " You ? " She had assumed they were watching the American doctor and the blonde woman . It was very confusing . The general opened one of the vodka bottles and poured her a tumblerful . " This will make you feel better , " he said , pouring out a glass for himself . She drank slowly , two hands wrapped around the tumbler , feeling the heat of the liquid in her throat and chest .  | She looked into the general 's face . It was strong , kind , manly . " Why are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closeness grow between them . " They can not bear not knowing , " he mumbled . " I do n't understand . " " They must know everything , " the general said . The train began to move and Tania felt her fear and anxiety slip away . A real enemy could only exist outside the world of the train . She looked at the general , the reflection of his profile etched in the window as the train moved out of the light . She felt suffused with sensations and mysterious yearnings . The general was watching her , just as Colonel Patushkin had . His eyebrows met above the bridge of his nose , his forehead was wrinkled with thought . " We must find a way to outfox them , " he said , putting a hand on the sleeve of her coat . She wanted to place her own hand on his , to touch him . But he seemed too formidable . " I will do anything , " she said . Anything , she repeated to herself , remembering Patushkin and the agony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told herself , it was the finest moment of her life , never duplicated . " You must tell me everything you see , everything you hear . There is more to this than meets the eye . This is a massive operation of either surveillance or , perhaps , interdiction . " " Interdiction ? " She stumbled over the word . " They are trying to prevent something . " " Prevent what ? " " Me . " She nodded knowingly , remembering his fine uniform , the glistening symbols of rank , the delicious smell of the crisp fabric . He had drawn the chalk line and she had crossed over to his side , irrevocably . " Do you understand ? " he asked loudly . Then he softened , and began to pour more vodka into her tumbler , which she hastily set down . " I must be alert , " she said sincerely , her sense of mission profound . He nodded and sat in the chair again , folding his hands , a brooding grayness descending over his face . She stepped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old attendant , the passageway was empty . " You must tell me everything that happens tonight , " Tania barked , beginning to unbutton her coat . The old woman nodded , but there was something about her manner that made Tania suspicious . That one is up to something , she thought . Perhaps she has been assigned to watch me . " What is it ? " she snapped . Long ago she had learned that these people responded only to intimidation . The old woman stopped her vacuuming and , with a wag of her head , pointed to the end of the passageway . " What ? " " The Jew , " she said , avoiding Tania 's eyes . " He is still there . " " How could he be ? " " He would not leave . " " And the body of the woman ? " " Still there . " " A dead woman ! " " He would not leave . " " You should have reported it . " " I wanted to . Believe me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " You should have told the station master . " " By the time I realized it , it was too late . " " Katrina Ivanov ! " Tania barked , hands on hips . The old crone was trembling now . She looked down at her fingers and would not raise her eyes . " Well , " Tania urged . " He gave me twenty-five rubles . " The woman looked up . " Before I could think , he had thrust them into my hand . Here , old woman , ' he said . Just like that . Here , old woman , take twenty-five rubles . We will keep her here until Birobidjan . ' It had all happened so fast . I was frightened . Who knows what these Jews will do ? He frightened me . " " Stupid hag , " Tania cried , walking to Ginsburg 's compartment , feeling the full authority of her railway service . She rapped sharply on the metal door with her knuckles . " Go away , " Ginzburg 's voice whined from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could feel the old woman 's  | eyes on her . The woman was goading her to great heights of indignation . " Go away , " Ginzburg said . " Open this door , " she cried , rapping more sharply now , persistent and loud , the sound reverberating in the passageway . A door opened nearby . It was the fat Trubetskoi , rubbing his pouchy eyes . " Stop this racket , " he cried . " We are sleeping . " Tania lifted her hand to knock again , then checked her swing in midair . Another door had opened down the corridor , and the redhaired KGB man was watching them now . " Sorry , sir , " she said to the fat man , who yawned , scratched his belly , and walked back into his compartment , slamming the door behind him . Tania picked up the vacuum cleaner the crone had been using and began to push it across the carpet . The KGB man continued to watch her . She could feel his dull eyes on her . But she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is us against them , she told herself over and over , as she moved the vacuum nozzle across the carpet . She cursed the stupidity of the old woman . There was no sense creating another incident . She herself had failed on two counts  --  purchasing illegal vodka , and grossly neglecting the disposition of the dead body . After a while , the red-haired man disappeared into his compartment . When he had gone , Tania turned on the old woman . She could not contain her malevolence . " That dead woman in there , " she said , waving a finger in front of the hag 's petrified face . " That dead woman in there , " she repeated . " She will give you the evil eye . " The woman 's stifled scream hung in the air as Tania walked toward her quarters .  | The cold seeped through the layer of carpeting on the compartment floor , chilling the bottom of his feet . A gray light revealed the outline of objects as he searched through little piles of cast-off clothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pocket of his trousers . He had managed to slip out of bed without awakening Anna Petrovna . The size of the bunk had become a joke between them , and they laughed at the idea that they slept , talked and copulated in a space barely fit for one undersized human . He found his wristwatch . It was 3 A.M. , Moscow time , but he was ravenous . He tiptoed to where his overcoat was hanging , put it on over his naked body and slumped in the chair , curling his feet underneath him for warmth . Outside , the gray light brightened , picking out shimmering icicles that hung from the white birches . Sunrise was not far away . I le looked at the long strands of blond hair that lay jumbled on the pillow . He reached out and touched them , careful to keep his hand light . He sighed , feeling the weight of time . One more day and one more night , he calculated , and then Irkutsk . " I 'll get off with you at Irkutsk , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finger on his lips to silence him , and he had brushed it away , holding it in his fist . " What harm would it be ? " He felt his own foolishness . " It would n't be the same , " she said , after a long pause . " Nothing will ever be the same , " he said . " My life has taken on a whole new dimension . " He wanted to probe , to force her to admit that she felt the same . But he could not bring himself to press her , afraid that the truth would be other than he would wish . How will it be after Irkutsk ? he wondered , looking about the compartment , imagining how it would be when she was gone for good . Already , his other life  --  Janice , his daughter , his work , the bland suburban life of Washington  --  seemed pale and insipid . In twenty years , he and Janice had not experienced what Anna Petrovna and he had found in just a few days . How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they let me ? He remembered the terror he had felt , searching for Anna Petrovna . Once he had imagined that she had simply fallen off the train , doomed forever to roam the frozen paths of the taiga like some of the escaped prisoners his grandfather had told him about . He had pictured Anna Petrovna as one of the spring flowers of Siberia , perfectly preserved in ice . Finding her alive , lying on the lower bunk in the darkness , he had wrapped her in his arms . " I looked everywhere , " he had said , holding her tightly . " I took a walk , " she said , returning his caresses . " We must have missed each other . " " I was worried . " " That is silly . " She reached up and playfully traced his nose with a forefinger . " You ca n't imagine what I was thinking . " " Was I kidnaped by a Russian bear ? " " Worse . " " Brutally abused , raped , garrotted and tossed off the train @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is quite possible . " He leaned over and kissed her deeply on the mouth , grateful that she was safe . " See how propaganda in your country creates stereotypes . "  | " The rape part was quite plausible , " he said , reaching between her legs with his hand , kissing the breast that had slipped from her opened robe . " I ca n't get enough of you , " he whispered , lying down beside her . " I ca n't envision living a single second away from you . " " Please , " she responded , then closed his mouth with her own in a long , deep , lingering kiss . " I love you , Anna Petrovna , " he said , pulling away . " You must n't say that . " But she drew him to her , caressing him , as he unzipped his trousers and kicked them off to the floor . " Do you love me ? " he blurted , his passion rising , the words exploding in the darkness . She gripped him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fury of her response meant as an answer , he wondered . " Do you love me ? " he asked again , his urgency increasing as he felt her body rise , writhing in the throes of a powerful force within her . lie felt his own blood pound as the pleasure surged upward from his legs to the tight focus of his nerve ends . Words lost their meaning , and he accepted her body , joined to his , as the answer he had to have . Then he lay still in her embrace , her body slack beneath him , her eyes closed , her breath even , her heartbeat caught in the same rhythm as his own . He watched her eyes open languorously , and was surprised to see two giant tears roll down each cheek . " Are you crying ? " She shook her head . She stirred , insinuated herself away from him and sat up , leaning against the wall of the compartment . He pulled himself up , slumped beside her , and covered them both with a blanket . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her directness startling . " On the train ? " " No . In Russia ? " " I was asked . " He paused , searching her face , the old caution surfacing , then quickly dissolving . " Must you know ? " he asked gently , wanting to tell her , but holding back . " Yes . " " Why ? " " The perspective is important . " " The historian again . "  | " It is a habit of mind . Perhaps the circumstances might help explain the result . " She looked at him . " Please explain . " " It is official business . " " That explains nothing . " " Confidential business . " " You 're teasing me . " " The knowledge has risks . " " Everything has risks . Perhaps the risks are greater if the knowledge remains in the shadows . " He wanted to tell her , felt the need to share everything with her . Perhaps that was part of the mystery of attraction , the hunger to be , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a stranger , at least in a conventional sense , although he believed that he had always known her . It was inconceivable that she would betray him . " Perhaps I am prying beyond my province , " she said softly . Then he knew he would tell . It is a test of my trueness , he told himself . She was suddenly his whole world ; the idea of boundaries between them was unbearable . " I have been treating Dimitrov . " " Dimitrov ? The General Secretary Dimitrov ? " " Yes . " " For what ? " " Leukemia . " " I do n't understand . Why you ? " " I was ordered here by the American President . He wants to keep Dimitrov alive . It has been a rather odd assignment , one in which I had little choice . " She seemed puzzled . He hesitated now , the full weight of his knowledge an impossible burden . Could he tell her that , by successfully treating Dimitrov , he had doomed Eastern Siberia , her home ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he whispered , barely audible . " For how long ? " He felt himself slipping into his doctor 's role again , the old mantle comfortable and reassuring . He cleared his throat . " It 's hard to tell . He is being treated with chemotherapy , and the  | results have been good . He has responded . But one can never be sure . He lives almost from day to day . " " I low long does he have ? " " He could die at any time . Or he could live for five years . " " Well , which is more likely ? " " You sound like him , " Alex said , feeling somehow unburdened . " I Ca n't make a prediction . I 'm not God . " He heard the echo of his own words in the dacha . Any prediction was pure speculation . She frowned , closed her eyes , became pensive . But the door had been opened . Should he tell her more ? he pondered . " That is the principal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same question , as if it were a death watch . Zeldovich  --  Dimitrov 's right-hand man . He was always asking , always obliquely , the same question : How long ? How long can Dimitrov live ? " " Perhaps he had good reason , " Anna Petrovna whispered . He brooded over her words , turning them over in his mind . Shall I tell her ? Can she help ? He wanted to share everything with Anna Petrovna , to smash all the barriers that had been constructed between himself and everything . He watched her , his hand moving over the wonder of her body as he searched for more and more of her . They had no right to take this from him . " It can not end , " he whispered . " It will never end in the mind , the memory . " " That 's not enough , not now . " " It is sometimes far more potent . Look at you , carrying the memories of your grandfather 's Siberia with you . The intensity is there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different . This passion is more complete . " He kissed her deeply , feeling the cycle begin again in both of them . " Our lives are totally different . " " Tributaries of the same river . " " For a scientist you are an impossible romantic . " " Is that what it is ? " " What ? " " This desire to spend every moment with you , to capture you , to surrender to you . For the first time in my life I am a ship  | without a rudder , drifting in your wind . It is a terrible responsibility . " " I do n't want it , " she said quickly . " It 's too late . " " Then it 's gone too far , " she said , stroking him tenderly . " I 'll never let you go , ever . " At the same time that he was drifting , he felt his strength , a new power over himself . " I will get off at Irkutsk and that will be the end of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his nose , his lips , while he smoothed her hair . " There will never be an end to it . " Then the words had stopped and he felt his life begin again as they embraced . Sitting now in the gray light , in the circumscribed world of their compartment , he marveled at the energy that had passed between them , the waves of sexuality that had sent them thrashing about the compartment , from upper bunk to lower bunk , in a whole range of classic configurations , as if they had tried to create new ways of reconstructing the primary act of procreation . Now , as he sat in the chair watching Anna Petrovna sleep , the sun was rising . It was the face of his watch that told him how much the rhythm of his life had changed . By every ordinary measure , his energy should have been spent , his mind clouded with fatigue . But he felt alive as he had never felt alive before , and for the first time he began to share Dimitrov 's appreciation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the grayness and the sun bathed the compartment 's interior . Anna Petrovna turned over onto her stomach , blinking into the sun , squinting and rubbing her eyes . " Morning ? " she asked " Theoretically . " " Was I dreaming ? " " If you were , I would have liked to be in it . " " If I were , you would be . " She reached out and touched his thigh . Then she lifted her head and looked out of the window . " I love this , " she sighed . The sky had turned deep blue and each white birch seemed etched in the landscape . " It must stay like this forever , " she said . " It 's done pretty well for itself up to now . "  | " It could disappear in a single poof . " He stiffened . " Damn your Russian sense of guilt , " he said cautiously . " Is n't it possible to feel joy without balancing it with gloom ? Where do you get the idea that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said emphatically . " From what ? " he asked . Were they crossing another Rubicon ? " Splitting atoms . " She knows , he thought . By God , she knows . " Would you save it if you could ? " she asked suddenly . She watched him , the light shining into her blue eyes , the pupils little pinpoints of fire . " If Dimitrov were planning to unleash a holocaust , would you destroy him ? " He continued to watch her , unable to respond . " If you knew in advance that he was going to order the first shot of a nuclear war , and if you had the power to destroy him , would you ? " She is one of them , he thought . It was an instant judgment , but even as he made it , he could not bring himself to believe it . Then guilt nudged at his throat . He had had the power to destroy Dimitrov . Perhaps he still had . But he had not acted . Was it because he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one life exchanged for tens of thousands , perhaps millions . " Would you , if you knew ? " she pressed . " I am a healer , not a killer , " he stammered , his thoughts cloudy . " You would let millions die ? " The question was delivered with such wide-eyed innocence that he became cautious again . They are trying me , he thought . " It is beyond my frame of reference , " he told her . " Then you would destroy Dimitrov ? " " I did n't say that . " He felt calm again , cerebral , under control . " If you knew in advance , for sure , that he was to be the instrument for killing millions ? " " I would have to be very sure . " It was his place of refuge . " And if you were ? " " Then I would ponder the alternatives . " " Does that mean you would kill him ? "  | " I did n't say that . " " If you had known in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hiroshima and Nagasaki , would you have destroyed him ? " " There the choices were different , " he said angrily . " Truman thought that by illustrating the horror of the ultimate weapon he would save tens of millions . He wanted to show the futility of war as an instrument of change . " " And do you think the lesson was learned ? " He almost smiled , delighted at the way she was parrying his attempts at logic . " Probably not . " " And if you had the power to destroy Hitler in 1938 ? " " How could I know what was being contemplated ? " " He had told everyone . " But how could I be sure ? " She fell silent . He watched her grope for words , her lips trembling . " I would destroy him , " she said . " The possibility would be enough . " " Then you would be God . " " I do n't believe in God , " she said . Her decision had been made ; she was sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said with equal finality . He had come to the core of it . Not cowardice , but a respect for life . " A single life is nothing , including mine . Especially mine , " he had added . Alex had thought it mere bravado in the face of death . " You must read your Marx , Kuznetzov . " " I have , but I ca n't remember the reference . " " It underlies everything he tells us . We are one family with a single objective , the organization of our resources for the cumulative good of the whole family . " " You had better take your pills and go to sleep . " " You are a nonbeliever , Kuznetzov , " Dimitrov had said with weary humor . " Cousins . " " Kuznetzov . " " All right , have it your way . " " It is the only way . The blood is the blood . "  | Alex watched Anna Petrovna , her skin pink in the brilliant sunlight now filtering through the compartment . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his passivity in the face of everything . Besides , he thought , his hand reaching out to touch hers , what do others matter ? o would not ask for the source of her knowledge .  | Like a magnifying glass focusing a single sunbeam to white heat , Godorov 's mind focused on the dominant obsession of his journey , the ultimate act of retribution , his impending murder of Shmiot . Planning it offered a counterbalance to his pain , as an act of imagination so compelling in its intensity that it could act as an opiate on his nerves . It suggested that the act itself would remove , by a magic that defied logic , the burden of his physical hardship . He dared not dwell on this thought , although he had begun believing in his heart that even before Shmiot 's body grew cold , his own back would miraculously straighten , his legs would quiver with sudden strength and the whole direction of his life would change . The possibility of such a metamorphosis seemed to increase in his mind as the train @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a wooden shell in which one might still see some of the trappings of Czarist Russia , including a Byzantine cupola and a broken carving of the Imperial crown . " I watched him for a long time , " Platinov had said . " I missed my train . He seemed as lazy as ever , sitting there in the little office drinking tea and twirling his mustaches while others did all the dirty work . "  | The mustaches were new . Could Plantinov be sure ? Godorov had prodded , over and over again . " One could hardly forget Shmiot . " It was confirmation enough and Godorov had had to paste a mustache on the face in his memory . Somehow it contributed to his hatred , warmed his blood . Only that kind of passion could have Ntistained him on the journey in the bouncing train , where each movement of wheel over rivet created new agonies in his body . The nolace that he had derived from locking little Vladimir in the room at c ) msk had now dissipated , although it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mind , the little brat symbolized all the meanness of Russian authority , the ridicule that one could suffer at their hands . It was not a child over whom he had scored a victory , but rather the monster of humiliation that had plagued him from the moment he had been sent away from his old life . The euphoria of his little victory had been tinged with a slight uneasiness , since he had half-expected the boy to accuse him . Godorov was prepared for that  --  in the face of the boy 's brattiness , witnessed by everyone on the train , his accusation would be seen as just another silly tantrum . But the accusation had never come . He knows it was me , Godorov told himself . Why is he silent ? He imagined that Vladimir 's parents had confined him to his compartment . Perhaps the boy had even been beaten . Godorov was fascinated by the idea , imagining over and over how it would feel to perform the deed himself . Once he had seen the boy 's slovenly mother emerge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the train as she moved toward the toilet . Where is the little bastard ? Godorov was tempted to ask . From time to time he would dart into his compartment and throw himself on his bunk . At Omsk the gymnast had departed and an old man had joined him , his age somehow affecting his perception and he had insisted on conversing , hardly bothered by Godorov 's practiced rudeness . He was the only passenger who had not yet gotten the message that Godorov was not disposed to transient friendships , or even to conversation . " I am going to see my grandchildren in Irkutsk , " the old man had begun , describing each child in detail , then progressing upward  | through the genealogical tree in an endless soliloquy . No calculated rudeness could shut him off . Godorov lay on his bunk gathering his concentration , focusing on the details of his act , the old man 's drone fading into the din of the train 's movement . The sunlight that streamed into the compartment was somehow disconcerting , as if the deed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagination , he had seen snow as a backdrop , great heavy whiteness into which he would emerge with a drop of wet blood  --  Shmiot 's  --  dripping from his finger , a dab of scarlet on the white starkness . Most important , though , was making Shmiot feel the same degree of pain and terror that he had felt . It was an impossible dream , he suspected , since he had to compress into less than seventeen minutes ? the length of the stopover in Karasnoyarsk  --  thirty years of pain , the waste of more than half his lifetime . He wondered what Shmiot had done with the last thirty years . It was the first time he had asked himself that question . The first time he had let himself believe that Shmiot had had any mission in life other than escaping Godorov 's avenging wrath . What would these thirty years have been for him , if he had held his temper on that fateful day , if he had simply given up his package without a murmur , as others had done , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Godorov had long ago lost the ability to imagine such a life . Even Natasha and their moment of love could not be summoned up for a hint of what that life might have been like . For that night on the train had also been the death knell of his sexuality . No one , not even the prison doctors , knew this . There was no physiological cause , and at first he had convinced himself that it was only some psychological trauma that would fade in time . But years passed and nothing changed . Besides , soon he was convinced that his injury had left him so repulsive physically that he would never again perform the sexual act . Once , long after he had faced up to the reality of his predicament , he did attempt to test his sexual response . He was in Moscow , shortly after his release , and it was not difficult to find a partner . Prostitution was officially a crime punishable by imprisonment , but that did not stop prostitutes from openly soliciting on Gorki Street , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .  | It was summer , warm for Moscow , and the streets were never empty even in the middle of the night . Perhaps it was the huge glistening canopy of stars , the full moon , a reminder of his night with Natasha long ago . He had been walking behind the woman , not by design , and had not noticed her until the crowd thinned and her high heels tapped along the sidewalk ahead of him , echoing loudly in the silence of the streets . It was not uncommon for him to spend the entire summer 's night out of doors . Anything was better than the stifling top-floor room which he shared with four other men . That summer he had taken to spending his nights out of doors , usually in a public park or on the grounds of public buildings , or even in cemeteries , where the flat ground sometimes caught the breeze which wafted off the Moscow River . Tonight he was heading for the grounds of Lenin Central Stadium . The woman turned sharply off Gorkogo onto Yulius Fuchika , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zod . Godorov was only aware that he was consciously following her when she turned again onto Klimaskina and he found himself going in the opposite direction from his destination . The streets were growing quiet , although people sat in the open windows of the seedy apartments that lined Klimaskina Street . Occasionally a catcall broke the stillness as some drunken man would try to attract the woman 's attention . Sometimes she would shout an obscenity back at the harasser , confirming what Godorov had already suspected from the woman 's suggestive walk and dress . He kept his distance , his anxiety growing as he contemplated how he would approach her . On Khodynskaya Street , near the Vogankovskoye cemetery , she slowed down and stopped to light a cigarette , the brief flash of light revealing a heavy face thick with makeup . She puffed deeply , blew out the match and turned suddenly to Godorov who was just a few feet behind her . " Store 's closed , " she said , smiling contemptuously . Her indifference gave him courage . " I have money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his pocket and felt his paper rubles . He always carried his money with him , never trusting it to the locker in his room . " Pussy is tired , gone to sleep , " she said , laughing at her own joke . He pulled out his pile of rubles and flashed it in front of her eyes .  | In the moonlight he could see her eyes glisten , and he smelled her breath as it mixed with the cigarette smoke . She had been drinking . " Perhaps I can wake pussy up , " she said . He peeled off ten rubles , making sure she saw the denomination . " Pussy needs a bigger push , " she said , giggling drunkenly . Godorov felt his palms sweat as he peeled off another ten-ruble note . " The cemetery ? " he asked . " Why not ? " She reached for his arm and moved with him toward the pillars between which stretched a single chain . They ducked under it and passed through , threading past the gravestones on the gravel road , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the air . They stopped in a little clearing near a freshly prepared grave . The woman looked into the gaping dark hole . " Getting ready for the stiff , " she said . Then she sat down on the grass and looked around her . Someone had recently put a bouquet of flowers at the foot of a gravestone within her reach . She picked it up and handed it to Godorov . " Now you can pretend I am your sweetheart , " she said , giggling again as she lay back . " My God , I am in heaven , " she laughed , folding her hands on her chest . " Come lie down and see heaven . " He dropped down painfully beside her , looking upward , the memory of the night long ago with Natasha vaguely recaptured . He remembered the peace he had felt , his last moment of tenderness . " The money , " the woman said . He handed her the rubles , moist from his hands . She took them , unfolded the bills , checking the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brassiere . Then , businesslike , she reached for his pants , unbuttoned the fly and reached for his penis . He let her , feeling himself heavy and dead , totally lacking in sexual response . " So you want me to earn my money tonight , " she said , bending her head over his soft phallus . He could feel the coolness of her tongue as it mechanically caressed him . He lay back and looked at the sky , feeling only disgust and misery . " What 's going on ? " she said . He looked down at her , saw the saliva shining on her lips and chin .  | Then she lifted her dress and quickly removed her underpants , spreading her legs . " Here , play with pussy , " she said , lifting his hand and rubbing it between her legs . " Come on , it wo n't bite . " She bent over him and tried again with her tongue . " I have n't got all night , " she said impatiently . His hand dropped away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he watched her bobbing head over his groin . Then he lashed out with a clenched fist , feeling its heel strike the side of the woman 's head . Without a sound , she rolled over on the grass , a big crumpled doll , her soft belly glistening in the moon 's light . He stood up and looked down at her . He could not tell whether she was still alive , nor did he care . In the distance a voice called , a horn honked , crickets clicked rhythmically . For a brief moment he had forgotten Shmiot , his mission , his need for retribution . He heard the woman sigh , then bent over and gripped her throat with his hands , feeling his strength as he crushed her windpipe . Then he dragged her over to the open grave and tossed her body in , hearing the soft thud as it struck the earth . Taking a shovel from the pile of fresh dirt , he sprinkled a layer of earth over her , then pushed the shovel back into the dirt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was no more than a motion picture in his mind . He sometimes wondered whether her body had ever been found or simply covered by a casket . Occasionally , he thought of her in connection with Shmiot . He had given the woman a swift death , but Shmiot would not be so lucky . The train was slowing . Godorov stood up quickly and pressed his face to the window , trying to see ahead of the train . Log cabins ( lotted the landscape now , with thin straggly plumes of white smoke disappearing into the deep-blue sky . He felt his excitement rise . Soon , he thought , trying to be calm , mentally picturing the station again . The old man babbled on . The train chugged slowly into the station . On the westbound side was a stretch of wooden platform on which a group of babushkas , swathed in layers of clothing , their noses red with cold , stood staring indifferently at the train . Moving to the space between the carriages , Godorov pulled open the door and watched the station @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , only shabbier . He jumped  | to the platform and a stab of pain sliced through his back . In his impatience he had stepped down before the train had stopped moving . The pain throbbed downward toward his legs , making each step more difficult , but he pressed forward . Groping through the crowd of vendors , he moved into the overheated station . His heartbeat accelerated as he paused to get his bearings , his eye searching for the little office that Platinov had described . He felt a moment of panic when he could not find it , then realized that he was looking on the left instead of on the right . There , indeed , was the train agent 's office , the door half-opened , and through it he could see a man in a railway uniform . Moving slowly , he realized that one of his legs was dragging , and the other was barely able to support the full weight of his body . When he reached the office , sweat began to pour down his back . A wooden nameplate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his long journey . " Shmiot " the name read . Godorov 's body shook uncontrollably at the sight ; his head pounded as the memory of thirty years ago returned in a rush , focusing the full power of his hate . He pushed the door open the rest of the way and stepped into the office , closing the door with a movement of his shoulder . A gray-haired man with pink cheeks sat behind a desk . " You are Shmiot ? " Godorov asked , his voice tremulous and uncertain . Was this really the cruel visage that was etched in his mind ? Behind the mustache , the spectacles , the pink cheeks and gray thinning hair , the man actually looked benign , kindly , hardly the object of a sustained hatred . " Yes , " the man said , his eyes calmly searching Godorov 's face . Godorov stood staring at the man , waiting to be recognized . Know me , you bastard , his heart cried . " Well , " the gray-haired man said with disdain , a hint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Yes ? " The shoulders shrugged with indifference , the old Shmiot emerging , recognizable . " You do n't remember ? " It was the first illusion to explode . How could he possibly remember me ? Godorov reasoned , his mind strangely calm and alert . It was dark . I was merely another victim . " I am Godorov , " he repeated , his voice strong now . He felt a charge  | of strength , savoring his power , goading Shmiot toward the revelation . He could see the man reaching back in time , searching his memory . " Do I know you ? " he said , his curiosity engaged . " I am an old friend from the days in the Gulag , " Godorov said , his face cracking into a smile . Shmiot 's body relaxed . He sighed . The word " friend " seemed to give him a sense of security . " Some days , " Shmiot said , smiling . My God , he looks back on them with joy , Godorov thought , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Shmiot asked , like an old general searching for a point of reference with a private who had served in his command . " In the Stolypin . " " When ? What year ? " The hatred simmered . Godorov watched as Shmiot stood up and held out his hand . Godorov took it , squeezed , felt the warmth of the flesh . The man walked from behind his desk , still clasping Godorov 's hand . His body was fit , lean and strong . Godorov felt the full weight of his hatred return , the rhythmic throb beat in his blood . As Shmiot stepped forward , Godorov tightened his grip on Shmiot 's hand , focused all his strength in one knee and swiftly jammed it into Shmiot 's groin . Another throb of pain washed over him , delicious now , as Shmiot fell to his knees , gasping , his hand still clutched in Godorov 's . He shook the hand off and let it fall to the ground , stamping on it with his foot , feeling the bones smash and Shmiot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shmiot was now on all fours , off balance because his crushed hand could not support him . Godorov came up behind him and groped between his legs , finding the testicles , squeezing with every ounce of strength , then lifting his fist and smashing the heel into the small of Shmiot 's back , in the exact spot where his own spine had been broken . Shmiot 's body crumpled under the blow , but Godorov continued to strike him , beating out the blows in a businesslike rhythm . As he had dreamed , Godorov felt his pain disappear : a miracle of transference . Shmiot lay on his stomach , his breath coming in short gasps . Godorov knelt awkwardly and lifted the head by the hair , looking into the gray eyes that pleaded their helplessness . " Do you remember , Shmiot ? "  | The eyes closed . A trickle of saliva rolled down Shmiot 's chin . Then the eyes opened and the mouth made gurgling sounds . He was unable to talk . " May you have a long life , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desk for support . He looked down at Shmiot 's broken body , seeing the uncontrolled tremors in the legs , which indicated that he had shattered the nerves in Shmiot 's spine . His own pain had returned . " Now you will remember , " he whispered , moving backward toward the door , savoring each second as he watched Shmiot 's eyes roll in their sockets . Godorov turned finally . The door behind him was open , and staring in , his lips turned upward in a broad knowing smile , was the cherubic face of Vladimir . The boy giggled , then disappeared . By the time Godorov closed the door behind him , the boy was running swiftly through the station toward the train . Vladimir ran blindly , not watching where he was going . As he reached the metal steps of the train he ran headlong into Tania , scattering the pail of charcoal she was carrying all over the platform . He stopped for a second and looked at her . Then he looked back over his shoulder and , seeing Godorov @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the train .  | General Grivetsky had been sitting immobile in the chair for hours . The changes in the landscape and the weather had made no dent on his consciousness . All his energies were applied to considering the essential details of Dimitrov 's plan . Dimitrov had revealed nothing , asking only that Grivetsky take command , get his fingers on all the strings of command . But what was to happen next was obvious . From a military point of view , the options were narrow . The essential ingredients were full preparedness , alertness , vigilance . He reviewed again the first strike capability of the missiles in the arsenal . The Chinese second strike potential was hardly a threat , in terms of either range or power . And he would order the Air Force into a full strategic alert , which meant that more than half the planes in the command would take to the skies as a protective shield against enemy aircraft . He was pleased with the weaponry that the technological people had developed and the factories had produced . Nothing had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The machines had been tested and retested , checked and double-checked . No other products made in the Soviet Union got such care . The only possible malfunction was in the area of human response .  | There could be no such thing as a totally automated war , he thought sadly . They must still depend on human beings , the most fallible cipher in the equation . Hundreds of mistakes were possible  --  an error in timing , pressure on a wrong button , an optical illusion , a sudden stroke , a cardiac arrest , psychological paralysis , an emotional blockage . He himself , of course , was fully prepared , mentally and emotionally , to react to the ultimate order . Grivetsky admitted to feeling a little uneasy about Bulgakov . Dimitrov , it was clear , had chosen to circumvent Bulgakov in the line of command . Grivetsky dared not question why . Private judgments were not his province . The fact was that Dimitrov was the ultimate leader , the power source . The Politburo might number sixteen members , but Dimitrov was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leadership . Dimitrov could charm them , terrorize them . Dimitrov ! He was cunning . He had bamboozled them all . Let them quibble over the fine points of leadership . If Dimitrov gave the order , Grivetsky would obey . They would all obey . The only question in his mind , the thing which made him restless , was who had set the KGB to watch him . Were they operating under Dimitrov 's orders , acting as insurance of his trustworthiness ? That was too insulting . Besides , Dimitrov would not have confided this mission to him if he had not had absolute faith in his loyalty . Or was it Bulgakov ? That was the one possibility that could not be reasoned away . Yet Bulgakov would not confess insecurity about one of his generals to the hated KGB , who would relish any hint of Bulgakov 's vulnerability . Or was it that the KGB was working on its own ? It was quite conceivable .

At least he could count on the solid loyalty of the train attendant , Tania . She had popped in and out of his compartment all day , bringing him tea and cookies . He was vain enough to understand the meaning of her offerings and old enough to be gratified by it . In return , he valued her as he would an English sheepdog that was obedient to a fault . During every visit Tania would report her observations , growing more and more chatty with each exchange . During the last visit , she had given him a rundown on each of the passengers , laced with her own observations .  | " There is another man in the compartment with the red-haired KGB . " " Have you seen him ? " " No . He is always in the washroom when I clean up . They also have electronic equipment and guns . " " Guns ? " " I have yet to see a KGB without guns . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctor and the blonde woman have not left their compartment for the entire day . Occasionally the KGB man darts out , walks up and down the corridors and goes back into the compartment . " " And the funny-looking squat man , the cripple ? " " Something very strange has happened . He got off at Krasnoyarsk and barely made it back to the train again . He looked pale and sick when he got on . I saw him walking down the passageway , holding onto the handrail as if each step was a chore . Then he went into his compartment and has not come out since , which is strange , since up till now he was hardly ever in the compartment . " " And the soldiers ? " " Still on the train . They piled out at Krasnoyarsk , as usual , to buy things from the women . " " When will we be in Irkutsk ? " " In the morning . At 7:31 A.M. , providing we make up the half hour we lost at Omsk . " " Will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said proudly . " We have beat the snow on this run for more than seventy years . " It was the proud railway employee talking . " There will be plenty of workers ahead to clear the tracks . " " It is an extremely efficient operation . " She blushed , taking it as a personal compliment . " You will wake me before we get to Irkutsk . I must use the telephone again . " Something she had said had triggered his curiosity , set his mind going in a different direction . Why was another KGB man hiding in one of the compartments ? " You say you have never seen that other man ? " he asked gently . " Who ? " " The other KGB man . "  | " No . " " It is unusual for them to stay out of sight like this ? " " Yes . Normally they are visible . Unless he is a technician using the equipment . But even then one man usually relieves the other . I have never seen one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a passkey to the compartments ? " She hesitated . He smiled at her benignly . " Yes . " " Could you lend it to me , Tania ? " He watched her flush , her eyes darting uncomfortably around the compartment . His half-conceived plan became clearer as he pressed her . It was a necessary countermeasure , he decided . Sooner or later he would have to force a confrontation and , if the surveillance was inspired by Dimitrov himself , it was better that he knew it right away . If Bulgakov had ordered it , that , too , was better brought into the open . And if it was the KGB acting alone , that should be immediately communicated to both Bulgakov and Dimitrov . " Would you lend me the key , Tania ? " he asked again . He watched as she twisted and untwisted her fingers . " I am afraid , " she whispered . " A great deal depends upon my knowing who is behind this , " he said , speaking gently , as if she were a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afraid , " she whispered again , her words barely audible . He moved toward her . She stepped back , but there was not far to move and her back pressed up against the compartment door . He reached out and caressed her cheek . Her hand went up and covered his , pressing it to her skin . She closed her eyes , and he felt the strength of his power over her . " You must give me the key . " She opened her eyes , looked into his . " I am afraid for you . " " For me ? " " They are cruel , " she said . " I have seen them ? " He placed a finger over her lips . " You must , " he said , drawing her body against his . He felt the outlines of her big body , the press of her heavy breasts , and heard her breath come faster . It was a subterfuge on his part . He felt no stirring for this hog of a woman . He brought his lips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . " Tonight . " She pressed her body harder against his . Should he kiss her ? he wondered , detesting the idea . She spared him the necessity . " I will come , " she said with obvious excitement . The skin of her cheeks had grown hot . " And the key ? " " It is in my quarters . " " Get it now . " She pressed herself tightly against him , kissing his cheek . When she was gone , he poured himself a stiff vodka and gulped it down . He had already relit his cigar when she returned with the key on a metal ring . " You must be careful , " she said , grabbing his hand and lifting it to her lips . " Yes , " he said , not allowing himself to snatch his hand away . " I will see you tonight , " she reminded him . " You must tell me when he is alone . " " Yes , " she said . " But you must promise to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly , mechanically , like a small child promising to always be good . This is ridiculous , he thought . When she had let herself out again , he poured himself another stiff drink and looked out the window . Heavy snow rattled against the glass , the crystals clinging on impact and sliding slowly downward . He bent down and slid his suitcase out from under the bunk . Clicking it open , he moved his hand around the inside edge until his fingers touched the smooth leather of a holster . The gun was cold as he removed it and checked the magazine .  | Alex straightened his tie , feeling Anna Petrovna 's eyes on him as she lay in the lower bunk , propped against the pillows , the blankets drawn to her chin . He had shaved , patted cologne on his cheeks and carefully combed his hair . He could not remember when he had taken so much care with his grooming . " There , " he said , turning to face her , reminded of a time long ago when he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look lovely , " Anna Petrovna said , a touch of wistfulness in her tone . The words were a caress . His love for her had taken away his fear and , with it , his caution . Otherwise , he might have reacted quite differently to her strange interrogation . As it was , he put Dimitrov out of his mind . She is an innocent , he told himself  --  not a neutral , merely an innocent  --  and that was enough for him . If I am to live only two more days , I would spend it with her , just like this . " Come with me to Nahodka , " he said . " It is impossible . You 're being an adolescent schoolboy . I have another life , children , a husband . " She paused , turned away from him . " You do n't know about me . " " I know enough to love you . "  | " That 's not enough . " " It is for me . I also know that you love me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I feel it . " " Sentimentality . " She sighed , patted his head , reached for his hand . " You must control your emotions . " " Why ? " " It is not scientific . " She was teasing now , playful . " You are making a joke of it . " " It is a joke . " He decided then not to think about her leaving , hoping that the train would somehow hurtle endlessly through the snow . " We will have the best feast the Russian railway can devise . Champagne . Caviar . Extravagant delicacies . " She giggled like a young girl , and he wished that he had known her sooner , had grown up with her , had loved her since the moment of her birth . He was jealous of every lost moment . The thought of her conceiving children with another man was unbearable . " Get dressed , " he ordered . " I 'm taking my best girl out for dinner . " " You go , " she said , a shadow falling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself together . " She put out her cigarette and watched him for a moment . He imagined that they both felt the same sadness . Tomorrow they would be in Irkutsk . " I 'll meet you in the restaurant car . " She lifted her head from the pillows and smiled at her reflection in the window . " I have a lot of work to do before I can be seen in public . " He bent and kissed her forehead . " You are the most beautiful woman in Siberia . " She pushed him away . " What do you know of Siberia ? " she said . " Only all the lies my grandfather told me . " " Lies ? " " It was all a figment of his imagination . As you are a figment of mine . " With that , he reached for the blankets and yanked them down to the foot of the bunk . He marveled at the whiteness of her skin in the light , the soft , youthful curve of her belly , the thatch of pubic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She relaxed under his gaze and stood up .  | " You 're magnificent , " he said with unabashed admiration , feeling the glorious sense of possession . " And you 're crazy . " She reached for her flowered dressing gown , hanging on a hook , and slid gracefully into it . " You go , " she said again . " I 'll fix myself as quickly as humanly possible . " He enveloped her in his arms , kissed her face , and buried his lips in her hair . She caressed the back of his neck . " We 'll go later . " " The restaurant will close . " " You 're right . I 'll get the best table in the house . I 'll bribe the maitre d ' . " " It 's against the rules . " " You Russians and your rules . " He kissed her hair again . " Fuck the rules , " he said in English . " What ? " " It 's an English obscenity . " " Say it again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she repeated , pausing . " It is beautiful . I must remember it . " He laughed , and started to unbolt the compartment door . " I 'm off . " " Yes , go , " she said , and pushed him firmly out into the passageway . The restaurant car , glistening with light , was a cozy oasis in the thick blizzard . Alex took a seat at an empty table , directly behind the British diplomat and the Australian . " Two bottles of your best champagne and double orders of caviar for starters , " he told the waitress . " A celebration , is it ? " Farmer said , his bow tie bobbing on his Adam 's apple . " Of sorts . Are you enjoying the journey ? " " It 's driving me round the bend , " the Australian said . " Never again . " " You should have flown , " the diplomat said . They had obviously reached the outer edge of tolerance as roommates . The red-haired man appeared at one end of the car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be exotic , " the Australian said bitterly . " They 're full of bull . This is one boring experience . "  | " It 's isolating for anyone who ca n't speak the language , " Farmer said , with exaggerated superiority . " These Russkys have nothing to say anyway . They 're a morbid lot . We should have kicked their asses in when we had the chance . " " He does n't think much of them , " Farmer explained to Alex . " Ca n't understand why the British keep an Embassy at Ulan Bator . It 's the middle of the end of the world , " the Australian said . " Precisely the reason , " the diplomat said . He was getting off the next day , to transfer at Ulan-Ude . " It could very well be the place where the world ends . " He looked up quickly to see if anyone else had heard . Then he pointed to his eyes and ears . " We watch and listen . It is like being between the devil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep breath , then leaned toward Alex . " We are trapped there , of course . They know everything . Not a word . Not a letter . Not a telephone call escapes their surveillance . " He looked at Alex to see if he understood . Alex nodded . Even if he could have brought himself to trust Farmer , this avenue was obviously closed . " The Mongols who live out here are in the middle , " the diplomat said . " They 've survived wars , disease , famines . They 're tough , beyond feeling . Even if the whole country becomes one big Gobi desert , they 'll be the first to dig themselves out of the ashes . " " Descendants of Genghis Khan , " Alex observed . " They once controlled most of the civilized world , " the British diplomat said . " Yesterday 's dishwater , " the Australian retorted . " He has no sense of history , " the diplomat said . " They 're nothing more than savages . " The Australian threw his spoon into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tablecloth . " No more than we are , " the diplomat said , looking with disgust at the mess the Australian had made . Alex listened to their chatter , losing the thread as his mind turned inward . In its way , his life in Washington had been a simplification of himself . His time with Janice and Sonia was merely a rote exercise . It is only real life was lived deeply in the mind , and his work consumed him even more because of the emptiness of his other life . And now he had found Anna Petrovna , the perfect balance between the life of the mind and the heart . Just a few days ago he would hardly have understood what the heart meant . It would have been far  | from any familiar frame of reference . The fantasy of romantic love that blared out in popular songs , movies and books , all that sentimentality that he had detached himself from was suddenly a burning relevancy . And that it should happen in Siberia , on the TransSiberian Express , compounded the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anna Petrovna , Alex thought , he had acted out the idea his grandfather had planted in his head so many years ago . He had come home . The Alex Cousins who had stood in Yaroslav station only a few days before had been a different man , detached and indifferent . What had Dimitrov mattered to him , except as an extension of his work ? Now Anna Petrovna had split open his mind as well as his heart and he was beginning to piece together what it all meant . " If Dimitrov was on the verge of unleashing a holocaust , would you destroy him ? Would you save him ? " For Alex , the question had created a new set of possibilities . Suddenly the waitress plunked two plates down on the table , bringing him back to his surroundings . It was the caviar , surrounded by little piles of neatly trimmed toast . Then she returned with the two bottles of champagne , placing them on the table in a stainlesssteel bucket . Instead of ice , the bucket was packed with snow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As you can see , we have plenty . " For the first time , the waitress smiled , showing a flash of gold tooth . Alex slid his knife into the caviar and spread some on a square of toast . I should have let him die , he thought . Knowing what I know , how could I have possibly let him live ?  | Zeldovich rubbed the bristles on his chin . He had not shaved in five days , nor had he changed his clothes . He had never been a fastidious man , but his mother had impressed on him the importance of changing his underwear and wiping his nose , and to this day he could not feel comfortable unless he changed his underwear daily and carried a clean handkerchief . Cooped up in this compartment on the Trans-Siberian , Zeldovich felt that he was wallowing in slime . He closed his eyes , felt the lids burn , and listened to the sound of the moving train . He took another deep gulp from the vodka bottle . Watching the wall that separated him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could see them , locked in an obscene embrace . All hope rested in Anna Petrovna 's hands , he told himself , convinced that what she would discover would be enough to net things straight . Moments before , Yashenko had stirred , opened the compartment door a sliver and looked into the corridor . " He is leaving , " Yashenko had said , putting on his jacket and slipping out of the compartment with the practiced silence of a big cat in the jungle . Zeldovich might have dozed . He could not tell . The distinction between wakefulness and sleep had become blurred . Vaguely , as if  | from a distance , he had heard a clicking sound , but he had neither the will nor the inclination to become alert . There was a burst of light as the door opened , and he opened his eyes to see the silhouette of a big man entering the compartment . Then it was dark again and he squinted into the blackness , hearing the sound of the man 's breathing . The light clicked on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You , " he heard the man say . The voice was vaguely familiar . Then he opened his eyes again and saw General Grivetsky , gunmetal glinting in his hand . Zeldovich reached for the vodka bottle , lifting it in a mock toast , and drank slowly . " Well ? " Grivetsky said , holding the barrel of the gun steady a few feet from Zeldovich 's face . " You should have a drink , General . Good for long journeys . " He lifted the bottle toward Grivetsky , who struck it with his free hand . It hit the carpeted floor and spilled , rolling to a stop against the foot of the lower bunk . " Dimitrov ? " Grivetsky asked , his eyes flashing with hatred . Zeldovich began to laugh . The tears came to his eyes and rolled down his cheeks . He felt the barrel of the gun against his forehead , the chill of the metal . He felt no panic . Let him shoot . " It will make a big mess , " Zeldovich warned , laughing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved the gun away . " Why ? " he asked bluntly . " Why what ? " " Why this surveillance ? " " Surveillance ? " Through the fog of alcohol , Zeldovich could not follow Grivetsky 's meaning . " Drunken bastard , " the general hissed . Suddenly Zeldovich understood . " You think you are being watched ? " The general shifted his weight nervously . " There is no other explanation . " " You think that ? " Grivetsky held the gun steady , but he seemed uncertain , an uncommon posture for the general , Zeldovich thought . " KGB troops attached to the train . KGB agents crawling all over the place . You . " Grivetsky pointed with the gun barrel . " Dimitrov 's  | shadow . Holed up here like a stowaway . Even the most inefficient Intelligence analyst could reach only one conclusion . " " It is not Dimitrov , " Zeldovich said , looking into the barrel of the sun . He finally realized his danger . " You expect me to believe that ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He felt his hands shake and the overwhelming need for a drink . He sensed Grivetsky 's anger . " You must be calm , General , " he said . " We are actually two peas from the same pod . " " What is that supposed to mean ? " " That our interests are not in conflict . " " Our interests ? " " We are both pawns in Dimitrov 's game . " He saw Grivetsky 's reaction immediately . The gun barrel was lowered slightly . " Why do you always talk in riddles ? " " Because we are locked into a riddle . " Zeldovich now knew he had the general 's attention . " What riddle ? " " The riddle of Dimitrov 's longevity . " Grivetsky blinked . " We both need to know just how long Dimitrov will live . " " Is he dying ? " " We are all dying . " " Riddles again . " " Dimitrov may be dying faster . " Zeldovich paused . " He has leukemia . Apparently the American doctor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how long ? " The general sat down , letting the gun rest on his lap . " You see the effects of such an enigma on yourself . " " What do you mean ? " the general shot back . Zeldovich watched his fingers tighten on the gun , but he did not raise it . " What effect would the death of Dimitrov have on your mission ? " The general looked around the compartment , as if he were seeking some escape hatch . Zeldovich knew he had struck home . He had never been truly certain about Grivetsky 's role until now , trusting the clues that Dimitrov had dropped . During the thunderstorm , Dimitrov had said weakly , " That is Lenin , cursing the infamy of mortality . Vladimir Ilich , ranting up there . He is crying for the lost  | moments . He had only five years . The lousy cheats . I hear you , Vladimir Ilich . I will not let them take me until the work is done . They will not cheat me as they cheated you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Finish what ? Zeldovich had wondered . Hints of answers emerged as he watched Grivetsky . He let the silence hang heavy as Grivetsky 's mind groped for some understanding of his predicament . Finally the general stirred . " Then what is the point of this exercise ? " " The need for knowledge . " " What knowledge ? " Was this supposedly brilliant general obtuse ? Zeldovich wondered . Slowly Grivetsky 's puzzled expression cleared , as he began to understand . " The American doctor ? " he asked . " He is the one . Only he knows what we must know . " " Of course , " Grivetsky said , taking a deep breath . " I had n't realized . " He pointed in the direction of the compartment occupied by the doctor and the blonde woman , and raised an eyebrow . Zeldovich shrugged . " The method is rather primitive , but considering the options , it seems to have the least number of risks . " The general smiled , then put his gun in the belt of his pants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I might have to resort to stronger methods . " The general thought it all over . " And this is strictly your own operation ? " " Totally . " " No one knows ? " " Not even my friends at the KGB who have supplied the troops . " Grivetsky was watching him closely , searching his face . Zeldovich knew what was on his mind , the central mystery , the heart of the enigma . Let him wonder , Zeldovich thought . For the first time since the general had arrived , Zeldovich felt the strength of his position . Bulgakov could not know about Grivetsky 's mission . He filed that bit of information in the inner recesses of his mind . It might someday save him . The tapping on the door roused them both . They looked toward it , the general standing up quickly . Zeldovich put a finger over his lips  | and pointed to the washroom . Grivetsky stepped inside , leaving the door open a crack . The tapping persisted , urgently . Zeldovich stood up , felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for support . " Who ? " he whispered . " Comrade Valentinov . " He opened the compartment door and Anna Petrovna moved inside quickly . Impeccably dressed , she looked about her , grimacing at the sloppiness . " This is a pigsty , " she said , sniffing the stale air . Zeldovich bent down and picked up the overturned bottle . " You look like you 've been enjoying your work , Comrade , " Zeldovich said . Bending down had made him dizzy again . Her eyes flashed angrily . " If you are looking for a definitive answer to the central question , forget it . There is none . " She stood stiffly in the center of the compartment , waiting for a reaction . Zeldovich said nothing . " There is only a statistical prognosis , " she continued . " He could live anywhere from five minutes to five years . There is no way of knowing . " " You believe this ? " " Implicitly . I am certain the doctor is telling the truth . " " Certainty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the slightest doubt in your mind ? " " Not the slightest . " Zeldovich sensed her stubbornness , her determination to be believed . But he was unwilling to accept her answer . It was not his way to live with uncertainty . The prospect of five years in limbo was very distressing . " You realize what this could mean ? " He put the question loudly , so Grivetsky would be sure to hear him . The woman frowned , her eyes revealing her confusion . " It is unthinkable . " Anna Petrovna sighed . " Inconceivable . " " I assure you it is quite a real possibility . " " I 've been thinking about what you said . " Anna Petrovna lowered her voice as if her words were too distasteful for her own ears to hear . " No one could have so little respect for humanity . That is insanity . Unless you are telling me that Dimitrov is insane . And if he is insane , he should be removed . "  | " You 've become sentimental over the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distrusted this philosophical softness . " I assure you ? " " Do n't assure , " he interrupted . " The information you have provided is totally inadequate . I must have more definitive parameters , something more positive . " " But there is n't anything more . " " There must be . " " Would you rather I lied ? " He could wish that , yes , he thought . At least then he could calculate a course . " If this is not stopped in time , it will be on your head . " The remark seemed absurd , plumbed from the depths of his youth . But he could tell by the woman 's expression that she felt its impact . " We can take stronger measures . " " I do n't understand . " " There are other ways to elicit information . " " I absolutely forbid it . " " You forbid it . " " You ca n't extract information that does n't exist , " she argued desperately . Her coolness had disintegrated . I am hitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be sure . " " You would torture him ? " " It is an option . " " It would be useless . " She paused . " I tell you there is no information beyond what I have told you . " Panic was gripping her now . " Who can be sure ? " " I am . " The woman was glaring at him . He rubbed the bristles of his beard . His threats were intimidating enough to cause the woman anguish , but he knew that he was helpless . She was telling the truth . " People must be told , " she said , after a pause , her voice stronger now . " Surely if we tell people , they will put a stop to it . " " Tell who ? " " Others . " She looked about the compartment like a trapped animal . " The Americans . The Chinese . " " Then they will move first . "  | " Our own people then . Surely there is someone who will see the madness of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . " She paused again , reaching for Zeldovich 's arm . " You are KGB . You have people everywhere . " " And what shall we tell them ? " The train jounced over a particularly rough spot on the track . The snow beat against the glass . " There is one course of action we have not yet considered , " she said hesitantly . Zeldovich shrugged . What did it matter ? he thought , feeling for the first time his own exhaustion . " We could tell him the truth . " " The truth ? " " I 'll tell him everything . Tell him what you have told me . Tell him why I am here . " The train bounced again , and she reached out to the upper bunk for support . " It will be a blow to him , " she whispered . " But he is a good man . He will understand . He will tell the American President ? " It is out of control , Zeldovich thought , remembering Grivetsky 's presence . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the words . " This has gone far enough , " Grivetsky said . Zeldovich turned , saw Anna Petrovna 's face pale under the makeup , the eyes wide with fear shove the high cheekbones . She stared at Grivetsky 's imposing figure , the gun visible in his belt . She turned finally to Zeldovich , her eyes pleading for some explanation . " This is General Grivetsky . " What else was there to say ? " He has been listening ? " she asked , more as a reflex than out of any recognition of what that would mean . " It is all right , " Zeldovich said , surprised at his own gentleness . " He is aware of the situation . " " Whatever happens to Dimitrov , " Grivetsky said , addressing himself to Zeldovich , " no one must know of my mission outside the Soviet Union . " He was every inch the military man now , secure in his decisiveness . " It is quite obvious that such knowledge can never leave room . " Zeldovich watched the general 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I do n't understand , " Anna Petrovna said . " Does he know ? "  | " Know ? " Zeldovich stalled the answer , not taking his eyes from Grivetsky . " About what is intended . What Dimitrov is planning . " It was , of course , too late to retrieve his credibility with Grivetsky . Anna Petrovna turned to the general . " He is planning to launch a nuclear attack on the Chinese , " she said , her voice quavering . " Zeldovich said he has gone mad . You must help us . " He watched Grivetsky 's finger move closer to the trigger of the gun . All else seemed trivial . " I must reach Dimitrov , " he heard Grivetsky say , seeing the gun barrel glint as the general drew it out of his belt . Anna Petrovna stopped talking . She turned pale and stepped backward , suddenly afraid . Zeldovich felt the paralysis of hesitation . Then he saw the question of his own survival written in the deep lines of Grivetsky 's drawn brows . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he had used to slice sausages . At the same time he saw Anna Petrovna jump backward , and her shoulder hit a sharp corner of the bunk , making her cry out in surprise . As Grivetsky glanced her way , Zeldovich scooped up the knife and plunged forward . The knife moved in an arc , upward , catching the general in the neck . Zeldovich felt the blade falter , blocked briefly by the sinew ; then it moved forward , cutting deeply . The general dropped his gun to the carpet , clutching the spot where the knife had entered . A jet of arterial blood spurted from the wound across the length of the compartment . Anna Petrovna felt she was watching a film in slow motion as the general 's body sank , the knees buckling , the eyes rolling backward in their sockets , a gasping sound gurgling in his throat . Then the general was on his knees , the blood running in rivulets between his fingers , over the back of his hand , down his sleeve , onto the carpet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sight of someone else expiring . He was conscious of nothing except Grivetsky 's fight for breath as his life slowly ebbed . Then suddenly his body crumpled , and he lay dead along the length of the compartment . It was only then that Zeldovich looked at Anna Petrovna , frozen against the compartment door . He felt in command of himself again , as if Grivetsky 's death had somehow given his own life a sense of renewed purpose .  | " It had to be , " he said , looking down at the body . " He was the instrument . " " Instrument ? " " It was he whom Dimitrov had sent to take over the Red Banner Armies in Chita . It was he who was to carry out Dimitrov 's plan for nuclear attack . " He heard her sigh . " It was horrible , " she said . " Compound it by millions and you will get a sense of what they were up to . " His head had cleared , his sense of cunning returned . She was believing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the truth . " Say nothing , " he said . " We have bought only time . Others will come . " " How much time ? " His answer came to him in a flash of insight . " That depends on what you learn from Dr. Cousins . " She looked at him for a moment , her lips tightening , as she turned and reached for the bolt of the compartment door . " Say nothing , " he repeated . " I will take care of this . " He was already contemplating ways to get rid of Anna Petrovna . He held her at the half-opened door . " And you can not get off at Irkutsk , " he said . She watched him for a moment , her eyes narrowing . Then she turned and let herself quickly out of the door .  | Tania lay on her bunk , imagining the moment when she would find herself in General Grivetsky 's arms . She had proved herself worthy of the general 's attention , she thought defiantly . By violating the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outstanding achievement , her future security , everything she held dear , for love of the general . Before she lay down on the bunk , she had scrubbed herself until she was thoroughly cleansed and sweet-smelling . She laid a freshly starched uniform across the covers of her bunk , then lay down to wait for the right moment . What she was contemplating , of course , was another violation . Cohabiting with the passengers was a grievous infringement of the rules and she wanted , above all , to keep the secret from Katrina Ivanov . She had enough on Katrina Ivanov on the matter of the Jewish couple to have her removed from the Railway Workers , but it was best to trust no one . The old woman had accepted a second bribe from the Jew , this time promising to help him carry out the body at Irkutsk and put it in the baggage car , which was like an icebox . The sooner the better , Tania thought . If the body began to stink and was discovered by an inspector , it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the key she had given the general , she  | admitted to some uneasiness , but she was sure the general would confront the KGB men and soon put matters straight . A general had more power than a KGB man anyway , she thought , remembering the pleasure she had taken in feeling the material of his uniform , caressing the insignia . The train began to slow and she hopped out of bed . Quickly she took off her robe and put on her clean starched uniform , buttoning it with nervous fingers . Then she stepped into a half slip , giggling as she took her cotton panties and , instead of putting them on , neatly folded them in the pocket of her uniform . She felt wicked , a trifle silly , as she stood poised against the compartment door . Then the train jerked to a halt and she moved swiftly down the hall to the general 's compartment . She tapped lightly and waited for his response . It was past midnight and in the sudden silence of the train she could hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind each door . She tapped louder . Perhaps he is sleeping , she thought . She tapped again , feeling her giddiness recede . Then the train began to move and she heard Katrina Ivanov 's cackling voice . " He is gone , " she said . She had been outside to fetch pails of charcoal , and her nose was red and running snot . Melting snow dripped down the sides of her coat . " That is ridiculous , " Tania said , panic rising . " The manifest has him ticketed to Chita . " " Just the same , he got off three hours ago . " She thought a moment . " In Angarsk . " " You stupid old woman , " Tania said with contempt . " I promised I would shine his shoes . " " Well , then you can go back to sleep . He is gone . " Tania grabbed the old woman and shook her angrily . Lumps of charcoal rattled in the pail . " I tell you he is gone . " " You old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Tania hesitated . She had given Grivetsky her key , and now had none of her own . Not to be delayed , Katrina Ivanov put the two pails of charcoal on the floor and produced her own master key . Tania unlocked the door .  | " See , " the old crone said . " I cleaned it myself . The red-haired man packed his things . " " The red-haired man ? " " The one in that compartment . " Tania felt her anger rise as she looked about , the compartment . The bunks had been neatly arranged and all signs of the general were gone . " I brought the baggage to the top of the stairwell . I think he got off with the red-haired man . " " At Angarsk . " " Yes . " " But it 's only a tiny hamlet . In the middle of nowhere . " The old woman shrugged . " And you saw them get off ? " The old woman looked at the ceiling , hesitating . " Did you see them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ busy . They were ready to get off . What does it matter ? They come and they go . " Tania kicked the door shut in the old woman 's face and stood in the center of the compartment . He would not have left without a good-bye , she thought bitterly , swept by frustration and disappointment . Her hand smoothed the pillow he had slept on . How could he ? She walked into the washroom . Surely there was something , some sign , some remembrance . On the floor under the stainless-steel sink she found a toothbrush , which she picked up tenderly , as if it were alive . She placed it in the pocket where she had thrust her panties and went back to her own compartment . The train had started again , moving relentlessly through the heavy snow . He was gone , lost forever . Just another passenger on the way to somewhere . She sank heavily into the chair , feeling a terrible chill crawl up her bare legs , moving upward like an icy skewer . She waited deliberately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , chasing the last vestiges of her warmth .  | Alex sipped the champagne and dabbed caviar on the toast . The snow was melting fast in the shiny bucket . The British diplomat and his Australian roommate finally disappeared , still bickering , through the restaurant-carriage door . It was a relief not to have to listen to them . The restaurant was emptying , but the red-haired man still lingered over his tea . Alex was beginning to grow concerned over Anna Petrovna 's absence . At last she came into the restaurant car . He waved , his heart lurching at the sight of her . She seemed preoccupied , and he felt a stab of longing . He could not bear to believe that she lived a life without him . He rose as she reached him , kissing her on the lips without embarrassment . Sitting down opposite him , she looked out of the window at the falling snow . He took her hand and found it cold . " My God , you 're freezing . " He poured her a glass of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said , lifting his glass and clinking hers as she lifted it . Her hands were shaking and she spilled her champagne as she lifted her glass . " What is it ? " he asked . " Would you rather we went back ? " She shook her head , her lips trembling .  | " I 'm being silly , " she said , throwing her head back , the hair shifting like silk . He sensed that she was terribly upset , but determined to hide it . " What is it ? " " You must trust me , " she said , the yellow flecks in her eyes clear against the deep blue . She pressed her face against the window and , shielding her eyes from the interior glare , peered into the snow-filled night . " What can you see ? " he asked . " A white world . " " Perhaps the train will get stuck , " he said hopefully . " Never , " she replied , her breath making a puddle of vapor on the window . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tossed off its contents in one gulp . Alex reached into the bucket and filled their glasses again . " I must not be gloomy , " she said , smiling . She drank the champagne and again he refilled their glasses . " Are you hungry ? " Alex asked , pointing to the caviar . Anna Petrovna shook her head . He felt her anguish . " What is it ? " " I want to go back . " He dared not question her further . Tomorrow the train would arrive in Irkutsk and the spell would be broken . He had vowed to himself not to think about it . " Give the rest of the champagne to that idiot there , " he told the waitress , pointing to the KGB agent . But when they rose and started back toward their compartment , the red-haired man rose instantly to follow . " Bastards , " Alex hissed . " What ? " " Nothing , " he said as they walked through the icy vestibule . " It was a lousy celebration , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt the half-digested caviar , a heavy glob bloating his stomach . Anna Petrovna sat down on the lower bunk . " Perhaps it was because there was nothing to celebrate . " She began to shake , burying her face in her hands . The size and  | strength of her body only added to the image of despair ; a frail woman could not have looked half so desolate . He sat beside her . As their bodies touched she moved into his arms . Kissing her cheeks , he could taste her tears . " We are heading to oblivion , " she whispered , sobbing . Then , after a while , she stood up . " There will be nothing , not a trace of memories anywhere . Only nothingness . " She rested her head against the door , then pounded it with her fist . " Alex , if only I could say  --  if only I could make you understand . " He stood up and moved close to her , kissing her hair , whispering in her ear . " I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Your deceit ? " They were the words he had told himself he would never hear . " You will never forgive me , " she said , moving to the other end of the compartment . She faced him . Behind her he could see the snow smashing against the window . " You have something to tell me , " he said , his heart racing . " I have been working for the KGB , " she said quietly , the words a bullet aimed at his brain . He felt his tongue freeze in his mouth and a sudden heaviness in his legs . Of course , he told himself . Had he had any illusions ? " I knew , " he wanted to say . But it was n't true . " It is not the first time I have done so , " she said . " But the last time was years ago . " He must have looked as if he were about to speak . " Do n't . Let me go on , " she said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ willing to suspend what you might call personal integrity . You do it for your country . I do it proudly for mine . We have a viable experiment here . We are trying to provide a better life for everyone , all the people . I live by that concept . Considering man 's greed and selfishness , it is no small achievement that we have gone even this far . There have been abuses , I admit that . But I am not ashamed of having helped to root out our enemies . I was quite prepared to give anything to such a cause . " She paused , clicked open her handbag and shakily lit a cigarette . For a moment , he thought she might collapse into tears again . Her  | speech had been ridiculously formal , lines from a bad play . He felt her pain and his own despair . It was all a charade , after all . " Alex " ? she paused ? " my darling Alex , " she said softly . He wanted to cry himself . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for millions . " Dimitrov had said , " Be careful . They are clever . " " Dimitrov is planning a nuclear strike against the Chinese , " she said quietly . " I know . " He watched the confusion in her face . Her body tightened as if it had been struck . Which of them , in the end , had engaged in the greater deception ? " You knew. ? " " Yes . " " In his dacha ? Then ? " " Yes . " " And you did nothing ? " " That again . " He paused . " I am not a killer . " Then it occurred to him that Dimitrov could have sent her . If not Dimitrov , then who ? " You must be one of the jackals . " He spit the words through his teeth . " What is it you want from me then ? " " Will he live long enough to do it ? " " Who wants to know ? Who hired you to find out ? " " Zeldovich . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever . " But he is Dimitrov 's lackey . " " I know his reputation . " " He 's the hatchet man . He does the dirty work . Everyone knows that . " " It does n't matter . Our goals are the same . " " Goals ? " " He is trying to save lives  --  Chinese and Russian . " " You believe that ? " " Yes . And you have confirmed what Dimitrov intends . " " Cross cross and double-cross , " he said in English . " What does that mean ? " " It means " ? he paused , remembering suddenly what they had shared ? " it means that we are both cooked geese . It means that we  | possess information that can not contribute to our longevity . It means ? " A thought intruded , pulling him up short . " But you are getting off at Irkutsk . " She slumped against the door as if she were about to faint . " No , " she said weakly . " He has asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shook his head . " With a trainload of troops and that red-haired goon and God knows who else ? " " You 're wrong , " she said . " He is trying to prevent a horror , a crime against humanity . He is acting out of morality . " She was shouting at him now . " There 's one man , at least , with the courage to act . " " Then why did n't he put a bullet in Dimitrov 's brain ? He was with him every day . He could go back to Moscow right now and do it . " Anna Petrovna 's upper lip trembled . Of course , Alex thought , Zeldovich would do it if he could get away with it . But what was Zeldovich without Dimitrov ? " He is trying to save his own skin . He wants to know how much time Dimitrov has so he can chart his own course . If Dimitrov goes on for years , so does Zeldovich . If Dimitrov is to die quickly , so does Zeldovich  --  unless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , all defenses crumbled . " You are his dupe , " he said gently , thinking about himself and his feelings for her . He wanted to draw her into his arms . " And a marvelous actress , " he said bitterly . " Alex ? " she began , a hint of tenderness in her quivering voice . Then she pulled herself back to the danger . " I saw him kill Grivetsky . The general from the restaurant car . " " Zeldovich ? " " Yes . In his compartment . Next to ours . " She pointed to the common wall . " He knew about us . Of course , he knew . " Alex felt unclean , disgusted . " Grivetsky was to be Dimitrov 's instrument . He was going to take command of the operation . " " And he was killed for that reason ? " " What other reason ? He would have killed Zeldovich . And me . Nothing , no one was to stand in their way . " Her courage seemed to be returning . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moment . " " And now ? "  | " I do n't know . " " I do . " " What ? " " You are the witness . " He wanted to hurt her at the same time that he wanted to protect her . " Anna Petrovna , " he said firmly , " if Dimitrov dies , you are Zeldovich 's insurance . He will be able to say he killed Grivetsky to prevent the actions of a madman . It will be his reprieve . " " And if Dimitrov should live ? " The question did not need an answer . If only she meant nothing to him . Was it too late for that ? His anger rose as he thought of Dimitrov , the charming monster . Could he bring himself to kill him for Anna Petrovna 's sake when he could not do it to save countless anonymous thousands ? Or even to save himself ? " We have both been made fools of , " he said , thinking of how she had betrayed him . " No . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The train was slowing for another brief stop . " You must not think of yourself that way , " she said in a whisper . " It is not important how I think of myself . That 's not the main question . " " When Dimitrov discovers that Grivetsky is gone , " she said quietly , " he will send someone else . It is all a matter of time . " " Time again , " Alex thought aloud . " How long will Dimitrov live ? " Was she thinking now of her own life ? he wondered . " I told you . " " You gave me possibilities . Nothing definite . " " What if I ca n't be any more definite ? " She shrugged . " You must get word to the Americans , to the President . " " From here ? " He looked at her , felt her anguish . And his own . He felt no compassion for either the Russians or the Chinese . He was not politicized like Anna Petrovna , or Dimitrov , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " How long will Dimitrov live ? " Anna Petrovna asked , her voice a whisper again .  | " If you put a bullet in his brain you would know to within a millisecond . That is much simpler . " " How long ? " " I told you . " " Please . Tell me again . " " Anytime  --  from now , this minute , or months from now , or years . That is the simple statistic . The odds get better as time goes on . As of four days ago , the disease was in remission . If the cells suddenly multiply again , he will begin to droop like a marshmallow over a fire . The end could be quick or slow , painful or quiet . He is sixty-nine years old . Anything can happen at that age . In any event , if there is a problem , he knows exactly where to find me . " His voice rose well above the din of the train . The compartment seemed to have shrunk ; he felt it caving in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He reached for the door handle and escaped into the passageway , walking swiftly in the direction of the hard-class carriages . In the space between the carriages he paused , letting the cold seep into him . He had to get off the train , he told himself . That , above all . This was a claustrophobic nightmare , and he was afraid for his sanity . Walking through the darkened restaurant , he smelled scoured pots . The little manager was slumped over a table , snoring loudly . At the end of the carriage , in the faint light , Alex squinted at the timetable hanging in the glass frame . He compared it with his watch , which was still running on Moscow time . The train would reach Irkutsk in a few hours . Irkutsk , the name had once brought back the richness of his grandfather 's stories , the feeling that a piece of his life was there to be retrieved . Now it represented a dividing point , a chapter 's end . He had had quite enough of the Trans-Siberian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Looking behind him , he waited for the footsteps of the ubiquitous red-haired man , but he was not there . Alex walked on . In the passageway of the hard-class carriage he took comfort in the noise and smells of the surrounding community . The never-ending chess marathon was still in progress . He felt the warm breath of the men as they watched intently , the old man still in the same position , all eyes concentrating on the chess board . " He has won continuously for the past three days , " someone whispered in Alex 's ear .  | " He has retrieved his respect , " another said . Pushing past the crowd , Alex looked into each compartment as he passed . He finally found an empty spot , in an upper bunk near the door of the last car , the one before the troop carriage . Again he looked behind him , searching the passageway for the red-haired man . Then he slipped into the compartment and climbed onto the empty bunk , feeling the hard wooden surface against his spine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . After all , she too had been betrayed . Pawns in a terrible game . Both of them had been used and humiliated . If only he could stop the flow of his anger . Conversations drifted across his consciousness , bits of reality that could not find understanding in his overheated brain . " Dimitrov is our man , " the President had stated  --  the President of the United States  --  and he , Alex , had accepted the contention as easily as if he had been watching a deodorant commercial on television . " He is committed , apparently , to a more moderate stance toward the Chinese , " the President had said , and that time Alex had heard the hedge ? " apparently . " So even the President was n't sure , Alex thought , his mind grasping the possibility like a drowning man reaching for flotsam . Could he be convinced , even if Alex could get the word out ? More than likely they would think him a raging idiot . " You do n't believe in this thing we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alex could remember the exact place in the woods near the dacha , the river rushing below them , the winter sun setting as they walked slowly along a gravel path . Dimitrov 's cheeks glowed slightly with the exertion . He is responding , Alex remembered thinking . He was hardly listening to the conversation , his concentration focused on Dimitrov 's physical reactions , the spring of his step , the measure of his energy , his alertness . Only now , as he played the conversation back , did it hold his interest . " This system we have created  --  this reorganization of life  --  this recalibration of man 's aspirations . " " What recalibration ? " " We 've reset the dials on man 's greed , the drive to exploit other men . Before Lenin , a few men in every country , more ruthless and talented than the others , would acquire an inordinate share of the world 's resources and with it the ability to manipulate other men for their own personal gain . We have changed all that , Kuznetsov . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world . We did it , in my generation , in my lifetime . " Alex remembered now that he had thought of responding , but did n't feel it was worth arguing . You do n't trust your own people , he might have said . What kind of paradise is that ? " Nothing would have been achieved if we had let everyone pull in different directions . We had to impose discipline . Given the circumstances , one might excuse Stalin . " Dimitrov had looked back over his shoulder at Alex . " History will tell us if he was right . All opposition to the central idea had to be rooted out , destroyed . " " And was it ? " " The struggle will only end when we are all put under one umbrella . Coexistence is a myth . That is the truth of it . Hegemony is the only objective . " He had walked on quickly , surprisingly energetic . He is growing stronger , Alex had thought at the time , ignoring the actual words spoken . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They can not all be pulled out overnight . " Dimitrov had sighed . " If only there is time . " " For what ? " " You are not listening , Kuznetsov , " Dimitrov had admonished mildly . He had opened his left hand and made a plucking motion with the fingers of his right . " There must be time to pull out all the bad weeds . They are persistent . We pull them . They grow . We pull them again . Someday we will pull them out and they will never grow again . But only if we have the will to keep on plucking . " He made plucking motions again and again in his palm . So Dimitrov did n't believe a word of this detente business , as the President so blandly assumed . " And the Chinese ? " Alex asked himself the question , recalling still another conversation with Dimitrov . It was another day at the dacha . He was taking Dimitrov 's pulse , feeling the steady beat against his two fingers , counting mentally as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half-listening to the words . " The Chinks . " Dimitrov would never grant them more than coolie status . The Russian word was guttural , offensive . " They are peasants , simplistic and naive . They must be taught a hard lesson . "  | Alex had felt Dimitrov 's pulse surge . " Stop teaching such hard lessons . It is making your pulse push too fast . " " You feel it , Kuznetsov ? You feel the passion ? " " I do n't know what it is . But I feel it . " " It is strength you feel , Kuznetsov . Soon they will feel it . " " Who ? " he had asked absently . " The Chinks . " " Ca n't you say Chinese ? " " Someday maybe . Now they are Chinks . " " When will they change ? " Soon . " Clues were everywhere now , rushing to Alex 's mind . " Do I care what they think ? " Dimitrov had said one evening when he had worked for fifteen hours straight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The question was meaningless to Alex , since it was the first sentence the Secretary had spoken when Alex had entered his bedroom . " History will be the vindicator , " Dimitrov had continued , looking into space as Alex removed his slippers . " A leader must have the courage to act . " " Without rest , you wo n't have the strength for the courage . " Dimitrov smiled , acknowledging for the first time Alex 's presence . " Do I look like a barbarian , Kuznetsov ? " Alex had hesitated . He is tired , he remembered thinking . He must be humored . " Of course not . " " Believe me , Kuznetsov , " he had said . " If there was another way , another path , I would go in that direction . But all roads are closed . They will not bend of their own free will . There can be no sharing . " Alex had tried to draw up the bed covers , but Dimitrov had resisted . " You Americans are such children , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready to acknowledge that I am an American , not simply a Russian refugee ? " Dimitrov smiled . " Naive and innocent , " he had whispered , his eyes closing . " We will not need to use our bombs on you . " The remembered conversations were coming to him like sunlight  | filtered through a prism in his mind . They had not been conversations at all , he saw now , hardly dialogues . They had been monologues , continuous and consistent , and although he had been a bystander then , he was a participant now . If only he could go back and relive the lost moments , probe the mystery of Dimitrov 's mind with the same zeal that he had probed his blood . It would have been simple then to send Dimitrov to his reward . And now Anna Petrovna stood to be martyred by his passivity . Himself as well . Perhaps , after all , he deserved to suffer for his lack of action , condemning half a continent to death . How could he possibly live with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bunching himself into the fetal position for warmth . There was no blanket on the bunk . He pushed his cold hands under his body , feeling the pain where the door handle had bruised the skin . He must get off the train , communicate with the outside world . Tell anyone who would listen . And yet , he could not , still , bring himself to forgive Anna Petrovna , not in his mind , although he yearned for her and continued to feel the power of his longing . It annoyed him that he could not shake the feeling . The urge to run to her , to throw himself in her arms seemed overpowering , although he lay still , forcing himself to remain where he was , as if imaginary chains were wrapped around his body . He might have dozed . He could not tell , except that a change in the rhythm of the train suddenly triggered his alertness . The compartment was dark , but he could sense bodies moving around in it , heard heavy breathing , the sound of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat up quickly , bumping his head against the ceiling . Climbing down from the bunk , he stood for a moment recovering his sense of space . A young man stood beside him buttoning a uniform tunic . " Nearly home , " he said . " I hope my mother and father will meet me at the station . " Edging himself out of the compartment , Alex moved into the passageway , crowded with people preparing to depart . Outside , men and women trudged through the snow . He saw horse-drawn sleighs , their drivers bundled snugly . Plumes of smoke moved upward through the chimneys of log cabins . Then , as the train moved slowly forward toward the bright lights of the city , the landscape changed . Huge  | blocks of apartment houses could be seen , and tan brick smoke stacks belching yellow smoke and showers of red sparks . He remembered how Anna Petrovna had talked lovingly of Irkutsk . To him , Irkutsk was merely an idea , a sentimental heritage handed down by his grandfather . To Anna Petrovna it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Was it possible that Irkutsk was on the edge of extinction ? The train chugged to a halt . " It is Irkutsk I , " someone said . " Only a five-minute stop on the outskirts . " Passengers had started to debark when Alex saw through the windows an unusual sight . Running soldiers , their heavy boots crunching in the snow , their machine guns at the ready position , were deploying along the length of the station . As passengers left the train , the soldiers stopped and interrogated them as they stood shivering in the snow . When they had answered satisfactorily , they were allowed to pass through the checkpoints the officers had set up at the edge of the platform . " KGB troops , " someone whispered behind Alex . A pall of fear had fallen on the crowded hard-class carriage . " Who are they looking for ? " Alex would not let himself dwell on the idea of it . " How long before the main station of Irkutsk ? " he asked someone next to him . " Twenty minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes still leveled at the soldiers . " They must be preventing someone from leaving the train , " he said , loud enough to be heard through the passageway . The fear in the crowd became tangible . Alex felt a brief weakness in his knees . He had decided to dash off the train at the main Irkutsk station and run for a telephone . He wondered if the KGB would repeat their blockade there , and if he was really the target of their vigilance . The train moved again . Back in the compartment where he had bunked , Alex looked about him in the semidarkness . The only other occupant was a big man , snoring in one of the lower bunks . Moving quietly , listening for any break in the rhythm of the snoring , Alex struggled to open the window . The upper portion was designed to  | move up and down , but it seemed to be jammed . His fingers shook with strain as he stood on his tiptoes and pushed downward with all his strength . Taking deep breaths , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ downward again , still listening to be sure the other man was still asleep . The train picked up speed , moving through what appeared to be a huge railroad yard . Electric lines crisscrossed overhead , layers of white snow weighing them down . The city was just awakening . Truck traffic flowed , and horse-drawn carts moved freely among the motorized vehicles . A slice of icy air cut through Alex as the window moved at last , making a sharp noise . The snoring man gurgled , then resumed his rhythm . Curling his fingers over the top of the window , Alex pulled downward , hanging on with his entire weight , feeling the window give finally and move slowly downward . Bringing the chair close to the window , he stood on it and stuck his head out , measuring the possibility of moving his body through the opening . The space was wide enough , but as he stood poised , waiting for the train to slow down for Irkutsk , the futility of escape from the train struck him . He was , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three thousand miles between him and the Sea of Japan . The irony of it did not escape him . Like his grandfather , he would have to traverse half the great Siberian land mass . It was formidable , impossible . But , like his grandfather , he had to try . Poking his head out again , he could see the lights of what he assumed to be the main Irkutsk railroad station . Lifting himself to the edge of the window , he slid his body halfway out , gripping the window edge with one hand and reaching downward toward the lower ledge , waiting for the train to stop . Until it did , he would be dangerously conspicuous . The moment the train stopped , he pushed himself out , falling like a rock onto a soft layer of snow . Then he moved , crouching , keeping close to the train , moving past the hard-class carriages , crouching lower as he passed the restaurant car . As he reached the soft-class carriages , he began to feel the physical strain , and he paused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could see feet moving , the lower torsos of the soldiers , the butts of their machine guns glistening in the harsh light of the platform . He felt absurd . Mild-mannered Dr. Alex Cousins , crouching in the  | snows of Siberia , freezing , moving toward an inexorable fate . It was ludicrous . Then he felt his rage rise , and with it his determination . He was going to get word to the President , no matter what it took to do so . He moved forward again , reached the windowless baggage car , then moved around the engine , straightening as he looked upward into the single electric eye of the engine 's beam . He walked through a crowd of babushkas who were patiently waiting for the train to pass . He calculated quickly . It was perhaps twenty yards to the ornate railway station building . Farther down , troops were intercepting the departing passengers as they stepped off the metal stairs . Their drawn guns were ominous . He tried to calculate his route and the timing . Then he started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ train and make his break for the station when he was parallel to the baggage car . The soldiers were standing with their backs to him , a human corral funneling the debarking passengers to the checkpoint . Suddenly soldiers were running , calling loudly to each other . Alex froze , then saw that the soldiers had crowded around a man and an old woman who seemed to be carrying a heavy object between them . Alex stepped back into the shadows and listened . " You must let me through , " the man said . Alex recognized his voice instantly  --  it was the Jew whose wife had died . It was the body of his wife , then , that they were holding between them , bundled in the train 's blankets and tied with string like an Egyptian mummy . " You must let me through , " Ginzburg pleaded . " What 's in there ? " one of the soldiers asked , jabbing the bundle with the butt of his machine gun . The arrogant brutality of the act seemed to Alex perverse and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , kicking the butt of the gun and lashing out with one free hand while the other still held his end of the bundle . In a moment the soldiers had kicked him to the ground . The attendant dropped her end of the burden and stood dumbly looking about as if she were just a disinterested observer . " Jew haters , " the man screamed , squirming and kicking as two soldiers lifted him to his feet and pinioned his arms . The soldier whose gun Ginzburg had kicked away from the bundle drove the butt into the Jew 's midsection.  | Alex watched , hypnotized by the sheer brutality of it . He stood rooted to the spot , torn between the necessity of reaching the station and the temptation to intervene on Ginzburg 's side . As Ginzburg retched and gasped , his body limp , his eyes bugging out , the soldier who had hit him knelt down next to the bundle and took out a long knife . He slit the rope and sliced carelessly through the blanket , then parted the edges with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The knife had sliced into her flesh , leaving a long black line down one side of her face . Somehow Ginzburg recovered his breath . " Bastards , " he screamed at the top of his lungs . The soldiers laughed as he screamed and struggled in their viselike grip . The commotion attracted the attention of the major who had been supervising procedures at the checkpoint . He walked directly over to Ginzburg , who was still struggling . " What is this ? " the major asked , looking down at the mutilated body . " A dead woman , " the soldier said . " They were carrying the body in that direction . " The soldier turned and pointed directly at Alex . The major looked where the soldier was pointing , then turned back to Ginzburg , as if Alex had been invisible . Ginzburg was silent . The major then looked questioningly at the old woman who stood trembling beside them . " She died . " The old woman shrugged . " That is quite obvious , " the major responded . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Jew stopped struggling , his eyes roving from his wife 's lifeless face to that of the major . From where he stood , Alex could see the glare of hate in his eyes . " Quickly , I have no time . " The major glanced at his watch briefly , then looked back at Ginzburg . For a moment they stood glaring at each other , vapor pouring from their mouths , their faces a few inches apart . In the split second before it happened Alex could see it coming , could forecast its happening . The muscles of Ginzburg 's neck moved and in the next moment he spit into the major 's face . The major struck him one quick open-handed blow across the face , a conditioned reflex . Then he reached into his tunic for a handkerchief .  | " You swine , " the major said . He poked at the body with the tip of his boot . " Remove this garbage , " he ordered the soldiers . Alex stepped forward . " I would suggest you stop this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . " Doctor , " Ginzburg cried , struggling again in the grip of the soldiers . " Doctor ? " the major asked . " You realize that you are being ridiculous . " The major watched him curiously , his eyes narrowing . " We were carrying Vera 's body to the baggage car , " Ginzburg said , surprisingly calm now . " She must be buried in Birobidjan . " " Is there any harm in that ? " Alex asked . " You are Dr. Cousins ? " the major asked coldly . " Will you please release this man ? " Alex said . The major hesitated , then nodded at the soldiers . Ginzburg dropped to his knees over the body of his wife and quickly brought the ends of the blanket together . He retied the bundle with great gentleness , as if the woman were still alive . " Now will you allow them to proceed ? " Alex asked . The major hesitated again , then looked into the face of the trembling old woman . " Make it fast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the woman the other , and they proceeded toward the baggage car . One of the soldiers ran ahead and opened the carriage door . Alex turned to the major . " I demand to be taken to a representative of the American Government . " " There is no one in Irkutsk . " " Then I demand to be flown back to Moscow immediately . " " I ca n't allow that . " " Then I demand to communicate directly with General Secretary Dimitrov . " The idea had come to him suddenly . He would tell Dimitrov about the murder of Grivetsky . The major seemed startled for a moment . " I ca n't allow that . " " I am his physician . " " I have my orders . " " From whom ? "  | The major did not answer that . " My orders are simply to see that you do not disembark , " he said . " I mean you no disrespect . " " You have no right , " Alex said . " I am a United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Do not interfere with me in any way . " Alex started to walk toward the ornate railway station , his body stiff with expectation . The major followed , obviously uncomfortable in his role . " I can not allow this . " " You had better . " " I have orders . " " You can tell Zeldovich to piss on a stick . " The major hesitated , then caught up with Alex again . " You must come back to the train . " " Kiss my ass . " The major darted in front of him , barring his way . " Let me pass . " " I have my orders . " " Fuck your orders . " The major continued to bar his way . The line of soldiers was watching . Alex had issued his challenge . Now he was waiting for the moment when the major would be forced to act . " Let me pass , " Alex hissed at the major . The major called his bluff . " Escort this man back to the train , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was instantly surrounded by tall , grim-looking soldiers , machine guns at the ready , ungloved fingers curved around the triggers . He felt oddly exhilarated . His sudden aggressiveness was as new to him as his feeling for Anna Petrovna , and , in its own way , as exciting . Finally , irrevocably , he felt drawn in at last , a player not a spectator . He was in the game now . He suddenly pushed with both hands against the midsection of one of the soldiers , feeling the icy barrel of the machine gun . The soldier struck Alex a glancing blow to the side of his face , making him reel backward into the snow . As he struggled to rise , the major bent over him . " You must not resist , " he pleaded . " Go fuck a duck , " Alex said in English .  | He got to his feet and started again for the railway station , his feet sliding in the snow . Another soldier stepped in his path , barring the way , and Alex barreled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he heard the major shout . He barely felt the blow , only the sensation of disappearing into an endless void .  | If there was one thing Zeldovich had learned from Dimitrov it was decisiveness . Looking down at the lifeless body of Grivetsky , he had the comfort of knowing that he had made a commitment . He had set a policy and there was no turning back . He had not consciously planned to destroy Grivetsky . But as the perpetrator of the deed , he had suddenly given himself two interesting new options . He could now pose as the savior of millions , the man who had forestalled a holocaust . That could be his ticket to political asylum in the West . On the other hand , he could also pose as an ally of Bulgakov , claiming that he had executed Grivetsky as a traitor to the high command of the Red Army . Anna Petrovna would make a reliable witness . There was , of course , a third option , one for which he had to be prepared . If Dimitrov was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever learning what he had done . For this option , all witnesses had to he eliminated . He was thankful now that his head had cleared , that his mind was racing , that the weight of indecision had been eliminated from his brain . He lay back , felt his body relax . Someone knocked on the door . Yashenko ! He could tell by the timbre and rhythm of the knock , casual yet urgent . He sprang from  | the bunk and let him in . At the sight of Grivetsky , the usually impassive face of the red-haired man registered astonishment . Zeldovich shrugged . " It was necessary , " he said . His casual tone seemed to placate Yashenko . " We must get rid of him , " Zeldovich said . " All traces . You must empty his compartment . " Yashenko nodded . " Bring his coat in here and his baggage to the carriage entrance . " Zeldovich looked at his watch , and fished in his pocket for the timetable . " There is a three-minute stop in Angarsk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attendant that the general is debarking in Angarsk . " While Yashenko was gathering the general 's belongings , Zeldovich washed , changed his clothes , and felt , for the first time since he had boarded the train , a delicious sense of well-being . When Yashenko returned , they propped up the body of Grivetsky and dressed him in his coat and fur hat , being particularly careful to keep the coat from dipping into the pool of blood on the carpet . " We must clean this up , " Zeldovich observed . They laid Grivetsky 's body on the bunk and both he and Yashenko , on hands and knees , proceeded to scrub at the stains on the carpet . Then Zeldovich opened the compartment door a sliver , put his cheek against it and observed the passageway . As far as he could see , it was empty . Opening it further , he saw the old attendant , her back turned toward them , lazily shining the samovar . " Quickly , " he whispered and they moved into the passageway , the body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead weight , and their muscles strained to keep it erect between them . They did not have far to go . Yashenko quickly slid open the door and they hurried into the freezing space between the carriages , leaning the body against the steel walls . Opening the outer door , Zeldovich peered into the snowy darkness , feeling a stab of chill as he drew his breath . Grabbing a handhold , he swung outward to get a full view of the area ahead , lit by the beam of the engine . The train was moving along a river bank . Zeldovich could hear the heavy gush of water , the crackling sound of ice floes . He smiled into  | the darkness , seeing the river below him , feeling a sense of deliverance . Ducking into the train again , he grabbed the sleeve of Grivetsky 's coat and yanked as hard as he could ; with Yashenko 's help the body began to move and fell away from the train . Looking back , Zeldovich watched the body fall , a dark hulk hurtling toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Zeldovich said , stepping into the train as Yashenko picked up the baggage and positioned himself at the entrance . Zeldovich carefully calculated the distance . He was deliberate now , businesslike , feeling nothing . He reached for the wall to brace himself , then moving backward , lifted his leg , aimed it toward the small of Yashenko 's back and struck . Yashenko 's body flew outward without a sound . This time Zeldovich did not look backward , but quickly reached for the remaining baggage , flung it off the train and slammed the carriage door . He took a deep breath , feeling the tension in his fingers ease as he opened the inner door to the corridor and slipped quietly back to his compartment . The train was slowing down now , moving into the tiny Angarsk station , a mere speck in the endless journey . He pulled out his timetable again . They would reach Chita tomorrow . It was unlikely that Grivetsky would be missed by Dimitrov until then . He had no set plan , in his mind , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over , his despair purged . Reaching into a leather bag under his bunk , he drew out a pistol , checked the clip for bullets , and put it in his belt . Then he stepped into the passageway . The old attendant was busy shining the handrail along the corridor . She looked up dully , nodded , and continued her work . Zeldovich went to Anna Petrovna 's and Dr. Cousins ' compartment and knocked . The door opened almost immediately . " You , " Anna Petrovna said . She was alone in the compartment . " The doctor ? " She shivered , drawing her dressing gown tighter . Her broad face was anxious and tear-stained . " Gone where ? " he asked firmly . She had obviously been waiting for some time . The ashtray beside her was filled with the short butts of cigarettes . Without looking at Zeldovich , she waved her hand in the direction of the passageway . " You let him go ? "  | " What should I have done ? Stuck a knife in his neck ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him what ? " " About Grivetsky . " " No , " she shot back quietly . He wondered if it were the truth . It was obvious that the woman was in an emotional state . " I 'll be back , " he mumbled , as he let himself out of the compartment . He walked quickly through the train , headed for the troop car at the rear . Above all , he must prevent the American doctor from leaving the train . He gave the major Alex 's name and description . " Dr. Cousins must not be harmed , " Zeldovich told him . Then he returned to the soft-class carriage . Anna Petrovna answered his knock after a long delay . Inside , he inspected the doctor 's belongings . " His coat is still here , " he observed . Anna Petrovna looked up at him , her feelings for Alex clearly written in her face . Emotional involvement , Zeldovich had found , was the shortcoming of all female KGB operatives , of women in general . " He is probably sulking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No one likes to feel betrayed , " she said . He watched her eyes fall on his belt , where his fingers touched the butt of his revolver . " You must not harm him , " she whispered . " We will do what must be done , " he said , deliberately posturing . Was there anything to be gained by threatening her ? he wondered . Then she stood up , reaching out to pat the linen dust cover of the bunk , her features betraying her uncertainty . " There would be absolutely no point to it , " she said slowly , watching him , her eyes occasionally dropping to the gun at his beltline . In the end there is only fear , he thought . " What is the point ? He has told us everything he knows . " " Are you certain ? " " Totally . " " Then what is to come is irrevocable , " he said , feigning a sigh . He knew he had pressed the right button from the beginning . Fanatical  | idealists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We have at least bought some additional time , " he said to Anna Petrovna . " But we have got to use it wisely . " He was being deliberately soft , lulling . " Dr. Cousins could be the instrument , " she said quickly , emboldened by his manner . " He could get word to the American President . In three more days the doctor will be in the Sea of Japan . Then in Yokohama . There he could communicate with the United States without obstruction . " She was becoming excited now . " They are the only ones who could stop it . " " How ? " American intervention had never been , in his mind , a viable alternative . Dimitrov had destroyed for him the idea of American will . " They have power , " Dimitrov had said , " but no goals . They are soft , flabby . They showed us in Vietnam . We could push them out of half , perhaps three-quarters of the world , before they would have the will to resist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In any case , this was the least appealing of Zeldovich 's options . There was , after all , still Bulgakov . It all came back to the question of Dimitrov 's longevity . " It is ironic that going to the Americans may be the only possibility of stopping this madness , " Anna Petrovna said , pausing to pull a cigarette from a pack on the table . " Is n't there anyone in this country in a position of leadership to whom we could take this information ? " It was laughable , naive . Who would believe Zeldovich ? He had left too many carcasses around . They would think it was some new intrigue of Dimitrov 's . Members of the Politburo spat at the mention of his name . Although he was only Dimitrov 's instrument , Zeldovich was the one they hated . " You are a remarkable man , Zeldovich , " Dimitrov had told him . " Remarkable ? " " You have a universal appeal among all the Politburo members . You are universally hated and distrusted . " Dimitrov @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Comrade Dimitrov , from you . " " It 's not so easy to hate me . I 'm too powerful . They must have someone to hate in my place . You are perfect for the role . "  | How Zeldovich hated Dimitrov now , and cursed his mortality . Mrs. Valentinov was looking at him and he was having difficulty concentrating on the conversation . " Is it possible that the Army will not obey when given the order to strike ? " she asked . " Soldiers not obey ? Bulgakov perhaps , but certainly not Grivetsky . " " And now that Grivetsky is dead ? " " Dimitrov does n't know he is dead . " " But he will soon . " " He will only be able to surmise . They will have to fish him out of a Siberian river , an extremely remote possibility . " He paused , searching her face . " He has gone swimming with Yashenko . " " Yashenko ? " " Our red-haired KGB friend . " He watched her shiver . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " He will find someone else . There will always be others . " " Is it possible that he can make such a decision alone ? " " A decision like that would be impossible to make in a committee . They would talk it to death . Dimitrov 's method is to act , then debate . If he is dying , why should he care what the Politburo thinks afterward ? " She was a mass of questions , Zeldovich thought wearily , wondering if his explanations were satisfactory . " If Dr. Cousins told the American President , would he believe him ? " " Perhaps . " " But certainly he would ask Dimitrov about it . " " And Dimitrov would deny it . " " Then what would be accomplished ? " " Perhaps nothing . " " Then it is all futile . " Anna Petrovna puffed deeply on her cigarette . It began to look as if there were no way out . The light in the east was growing and the snow continued to whip against the windows as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it swirled in an uneven cascade against the windows .  | " We will be reaching Irkutsk soon , " Anna Petrovna said , a catch in her voice . " Did you tell your people you would be arriving on this train ? " " I sent them a postcard from Moscow . " " Will they be at the station ? " " Yes . My husband and my two children . I have been away from home more than a month . " He could see that she was holding herself stiffly , under tight control . There are always unseen complications , he observed with resignation . He remembered his early days at the KGB . The people who rose within its system were those least encumbered by family , friends , emotional ties . It had been the primary lesson of his own career . Human involvements were a disaster in objective intelligence work . " And what will they do when you do not arrive ? " " They will worry . " " Then we must get word to them . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He could not care less whether her family worried or not . The problem was that they would undoubtedly make inquiries , create difficulties . " Write them a note . Tell them you have been delayed in Moscow and that you will get word to them as soon as you know when you are coming . " Her disappointment was quite visible . " Just let me speak to them for a moment , " she pleaded . " It is out of the question . " " What harm could it do ? " " I am not really sure , but we should preclude the possibilities . Sometimes information is transmitted inadvertently . " " But I might never see them again ? " She hesitated . Did she sense her danger ? He thought he had reassured her . But she was the only living witness to the murder of Grivetsky . And she knew it . She looked at him , her eyes coming to life with hatred . " You are a cold man , Zeldovich . " He reached into an inner pocket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piece of paper . Anna Petrovna removed a small notebook from her purse . He motioned her to sit down , holding the pen toward her . Taking it , she sat down and began to write as he stood watching  | the snow beat against the windows . Through the snowflakes , he could see the beginnings of civilization again . Trucks and sleds moved along the roads . Electric lights beamed through the blizzard . Watching her writing , her head bowed low over the table , he felt his own sense of decisiveness falter . Perhaps the simplest solution would be to eliminate Mrs. Valentinov and Dr. Cousins and fly back to Dimitrov . But then he would be tied to Dimitrov 's life-span , exactly the situation from which he was trying to extricate himself . Or should he contact Bulgakov ? Tell him everything . Cement the alliance . Was there future security in that ? Or seek asylum ? Simply get on the boat in Nakhodka with Dr. Cousins and let him explain the situation to the American President . He felt the wheels of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ babushkas leaned over their shovels . " It is the first station in Irkutsk , the outskirts , " Anna Petrovna said looking up , her eyes glistening with tears . " I will be back , " he said , letting himself out of the compartment . From the passageway he could see the soldiers dispersing outside along the length of the train , running beside it as it slowed . Satisfied , he went into his own compartment and pulled on his coat and fur hat , drawing on his gloves . Whatever happened , they would have to search the train after Irkutsk for Dr. Cousins . After Irkutsk , there would be fewer passengers . Before he left the compartment , he looked around again , noticing that the bloodstains were brownish now , but barely distinguishable . He put an extra packet of bullets into the side pocket of his coat . As he let himself out , the train began to move again , heading for the heart of Irkutsk . He reentered Mrs. Valentinov 's compartment . Anna Petrovna stood now , waiting . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want to see them , to point them out . " He took the proffered note and opened it . " Must you ? " she asked quickly . " Of course . " " Darling , " the note began , " I 'm sorry I could not arrive but unforeseen delays have kept me in Moscow . As soon as I know when I can return , I will let you know . Please forgive me . I miss you all very  | much and send my love . You must take good care of each other . Mother . " Something in the note disturbed him . Perhaps it was the way she signed it . Would they detect something amiss ? " Why do you sign it Mother ' ? " he asked . " It is addressed primarily to my children . " " And your husband ? " " He will understand . " " Understand what ? " " That it is addressed to the children . " He pondered its meaning for a moment , sensing the relationship , accepting the explanation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to indicate a finality , a farewell . " " I am being realistic . " " Could you alter it ? " he asked . forcing himself to speak gently . " To what ? " " Perhaps You must all take good care of each other until I see you again . ' " She shrugged . " What does it matter ? " Taking the note from him , she leaned over the table and quickly scribbled the additional phrase . " There . Are you satisfied now ? " " Yes . " " I wonder if I ever will see them again . " " That is the whole point of this exercise . " " I suppose , " she sighed , slumping heavily into the chair and watching the early morning activity of Irkutsk through the window . " What a lovely morning ! " she whispered . " Lovely ? " " To a Siberian , snow can be as lovely as sunlight . One could not imagine Irkutsk without snow . I always felt sorry for people who lived in the south @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never been in Siberia before . " " That is obvious . " She turned to the window again . He leaned against the bunk , watching her profile against the glow of lights . " Summer , too , is lovely here , " Anna Petrovna said , talking more to herself than to Zeldovich . " The flowers in a Siberian summer are  | brighter than anywhere in the world . Sometimes in the winter you see it in your mind 's eye and long for it . " She paused , then shook her head and turned to Zeldovich . " Is it possible that there are people who would want to deliberately destroy this ? " " Without a tear . " She watched him . He could feel her eyes boring through him . " And you , Zeldovich , does it really matter to you ? " He hesitated a moment , feeling the iciness of his own indifference . He did not care about the snow or the flowers , or anything other than his own survival . " I am not sure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the truth as any words he had ever uttered . The train slowed again , moving through the railyards . Zeldovich opened the compartment door and Anna Petrovna followed him . They watched the soldiers jump to the platform and form a line along the length of the moving train . " Soldiers , " she whispered , her breath warm against his cheek . " A precaution . For his own good . " In the passageway a procession began of passengers for Irkutsk . Anna Petrovna peered onto the lighted platform , searching the faces of the crowd . Suddenly she gripped his arm . " There , " she pointed , ducking behind Zeldovich . " They mus n't see me . There . The two little boys with red woolen hats . " She began to sob . " Get back into the compartment , " he ordered firmly . " Please , " she said , clutching his arm . " They will see you , " he said , wrenching free and pushing her back toward the inner wall of the passageway . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streaming down her cheeks . " If they see you , I will shoot them , " he hissed . In the end , it was only threats that worked , he told himself , disgusted as his earlier feelings of sentimentality . " Do you understand me ? " he whispered . She nodded , and stood back against the corridor wall . Zeldovich rushed through the corridor and stepped into the snow , walking quickly in the direction of the major . " Keep a close watch , " he said . " No one can get through , " the major answered . walking by his side through the checkpoint . Zeldovich looked around and spotted the red
