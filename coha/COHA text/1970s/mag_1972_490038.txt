THE TALK OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment IN line with the government 's policy of altering the dates of holidays to give people more time for rest and recreation , we have a suggestion for one more change . Christmas should be switched from December 25th to February 29th . This would provide a decent interval between our spells of national hysteria , stem the tide of infla  --  tion , restore millions of American males to a state of health , build the character of the nation 's children in accordance with President Nixon 's ideal of disci  --  pline and responsibility , take women out of the stores and put them hack in the home and the office , and usher in a new era of tranquillity , sanity , and peace . If small groups of carollers and worshippers wish to celebrate the birth of Christ on December 25th , they will he free to do so without interference from the government . But all other Yuletide activities will he moved to the new and official date  --  February 29th . Bombard Him ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has for some s eats been known as a high-crime area  --  a scene of numer  --  ous burglaries and robberies . This y ear , it is reporting about twenty-two per cent fewer crimes than last year , and the reasons for this drop seem to lie both in the police force and in the resi  --  dents of the area themselves . At the beginning of the year , a number of policemen who had been assigned to the precinct for some years were trans  --  ferred elsewhere , new patrolmen were brought in , and something called the Neighborhood Police Team Concept was instituted . In addition , an increas  --  ing number of block associations have been formed and have hired private guards to patrol their streets in the evening . Where the criminals have gone is unclear , but our friends in the precinct generally feel the situation has improved . A regular event for the new pre  --  cinct personnel and for the new block associations is a meeting at which police officers can advise residents on how to cope with crime . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on 101st Street , and it turned out to be an opportunity for about twenty residents to exchange stories of muggings , near muggings , and the like . Last week , we attended another meeting , this one held at the Equity Library Theatre , on 103rd Street , by the 102nd-103rd Street Block Association , and it was a less gossipy affair . About ninety people were there . They heard speeches by four police officers , asked more questions than could be answered , and then took up their regular business . The meeting lasted over two hours . Deputy Inspec  --  tor Norman Andersson , of the local pre  --  cinct , explained that the Neighborhood Policy Team Concept meant that the precinct had been divided into six areas , each with its own team of patrolmen . " A big part of police work is getting to know where your trouble spots are  --  who your had people are , and sour bad places  --  so you can concentrate on them , " he said . " Our Neighborhood Police Teams can do this . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the precinct . " Sergeant John Moreno , the leader of the team in that particarlar neighborhood , urged the resi  --  dents to call him if they had any com  --  plaints . He also told of a study he had made , which showed that blocks with private guards had about half as many burglaries and robberies as other blocks had . He was followed bs Patrolmen Charles Rodstrom and Vincent Al  --  banese , who instructed the residents in how to reduce these crimes further . " The best thing you can do to keep burglars and robbers out of your build  --  ings is to be rude , " Patrolman Rodstrom said . " That means to slam the door in someone 's face if he 's coming in after y ou . It 's very rude , but if ) do n't know them you have to take it for granted that they do n't belong there . " Patrolman Albanese demonstrated a number of locks , and said that the best combination to have is a mortise-mounted dead-bolt or drop-bolt lock with a guard plate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and an indoor buttress , usually called a police lock . The residents ' questions often touched on alleged incidents of police negligence , and sometimes concerned matters that were not the responsibility of the police at all . One woman com  --  plained to Inspector Andersson about her doorman , who had refused to hunt down a burglar . Several people ex  --  pressed opposition to a methadone-treatment center that St. Luke 's Hos  --  pital has considered setting up in the neighborhood . Only two people showed any inclination not to worry about crime . One , a woman , said , " I just want to say something posi  --  tive . My parents were bur  --  glarized twice , and my brother once , and although my parents did n't get their things back , my brother had a serial number on his TV and he got his set back . " The other person , also a woman , said to Inspec  --  tor Andersson , " We always hear , ' Do n't go out at night . Do n't go out at night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afraid of going out at night ? " " Yes , sure , " the Inspector said . " The more people in the street , the safer the people are . " " But when you ask the police , they always say you should be afraid of crime , " the woman said . " Is n't this wrong " " I do n't know  --  you ca n't get in  --  volved if you 're not out in the street , " the Inspector said . " But the more peo  --  ple there are out in the street , the safer it is for everyone . " The 102nd-103rd Street Block As 4-6 DECEMBER 2 , l 9 7 2 suciation now has two guards patrolling each evening . At the meeting , the resi  --  dents voted unanimously to raise money to hire a third , who would patrol part-time four hours a day from Monday to Thursday and eight hours on Fri  --  day . We might comment that since the guards arc equipped only with hilly clubs and a walkie-talkie , they do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ street corner , " which Chief Justice Warren E. Burger re cently said was " not the kind of America that we want . " The most persuasive speaker of the evening was the last  --  Jenne ss Eertmned , who gave a re  --  port on bright street light ing as a deterrent to crime . She said that two new lamps had been erected on the corners of 103rd Street at West End Avenue and at Riverside Drive , and that the one at West End Avenue had been turned on but the one on the Drive had not . " Con Edison is sup  --  posed to turn it on , " she said , " and we 've been calling and calling and call  --  ing . And we 've been calling the May  --  or 's Office . And we 've been calling the city . And nothing happe-ns . That light was put tip in July , 1971 . It 's been a year and a half , and it 's still not on . I think we should ask why not .

" We saw several people writing the number down . Philip Brooks is super  --  intendent of street lighting in the Bu  --  reau of Gas and Electricity , in the Department of Public Works , in the Municipal Service Administration . His number is actually 566-3551 , and his office says he will be on vacation until mid-December . Covering the Big Game Ti-TE PROGRAM SCTADIT2M : Legion Field , Binning- ham , Alabama .

FRIDAY AFTERNOON BOUT one o'clock , we went out to the stadium with Wilkinson and Schenkel to watch the two teams work out . It was a mild , breezy , cloudy dm . The Tigers took the field first , wearing dark-blue sweatsuits and helmets but no pads . The stadium was soon echoing with shouts and laughter , and with the thunk of shoes against footballs and the splat of bullet passes hitting receivers . The Tigers seemed playful and relaxed . Instead of calling the usual signals , Bert Jones , the quarterback , was Si ) ing , " Ready on the left ? Ready on the light ? Ball , PLEASE ! " Wilkinson said that Jones was the best-looking passer he 'd come across all year . We followed Wilkinson and Schenkel down to the field for a better view of the train and stood near the sideline , at midfield . We also got our first closeup view of arti  --  ficial turf . It looked and felt a lot like a deep-pile carpet with it foam-rubber pad under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tive big guy , came over to see NVilkin  --  son . He said , " Hi , Coach . " Wilkinson said , " Everybody ready ? " " Yeah . We 're even kinda glad to get away from home , " McClendon said . " You know , Coach , you play around your own people and you take things for granted . Sometimes it 's good to have to start fightin ' for your life . " " That was a real thriller last week , " Schenkel said , referring to a game that L.S.U. had won by a single point . " If you had written a script like that , people would n't have believed it , " McClendon said . " I tell you , that Jones has got so much confidence . He thinks he can do anything . There was one second left , and I said , ' Well , son , this is it . Stick it to ' em . ' And you know what he said ? Nuthin ' . He just winked at rue . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " McClendon was obviously sky-high for the next day 's game . His conversation had a jit  --  tery , compulsive quality , like that of someone who 's talking to cover the sound of his teeth chattering . " You have anything special you 're going to do ? " Wilkinson asked . McClendon said , " Naw , Coach , I tell You . There 's just one thing . Like the punting game . We might  --  de  --  pending on where we arc and what the score is  --  we might drop one off nn ' em . I do n't know whether they 're going on the returns , but they 're trying to get all the rushes up there . But basically we just want to do the things we do best . Stick with ' cm . Last year , we tried to get real smart . Two rears ago , we ran straight at Alabama . It was n't pretty at all . It was just those three and four yards . But we had the football . They could n't score . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We 've got to control the ball and not let them have it They did n't make a mistake last year . Damn , they 're due one . They 're due one , are n't they , Coach ? I mean , God O'mighty , how long can you go ? " McClendon 's eyes sparkled . He looked ready to suit up and make some vicious tackles . When the L.S.U. team headed for the locker room , two young boys ap  --  proached Wilkinson and asked for his autograph . As he signed , we asked him if he missed coaching . " Well , you do n't miss the recniiting , I 'll guarantee you that , " Wilkinson said . " You 're glad to he out of that phase of it . But I do miss the relationship with the players . Some people look on that relationship as no longer valid . But that 's a misunder  --  standing . It 's very valid . A kid coming to a major university as a freshman today is not a whole lot different from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kids are people of great potential , not only athletically but as people . They are people who are not in any way defeated by the world yet . They honestly believe that they 're ca THE NEW YORKER pable of winning the big brass ring . So they 've got that super-enthusiasm . Now , whenyou 've got talent and en  --  thusiasm and willingness to grow , it 's really something  --  it 's a unique cir  --  cumstance . You miss that . In most businesses or political campaigns , or whatever , you 've got a full range of emotions and interests , some good , some bad . But with these kids it is n't that way at all . And then the game itself is very , very fascinating  --  the strategy and tactics of how you play . This changes  --  not dramatically , a little every year . There is very seldom anything really new in football , but there are interesting mutations . So every year you have these new  --  well , fashions , really . " This year 's fashion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ T , which Wilkinson perfect  --  ed at Oklahoma , and its principal exponent is Darrell Royal , the head coach at the University of Texas , who played quarterback for Wilkinson . We remarked that Wilkinson looked fit enough to play a few downs , and asked him how he kept in shape . " Well , I do n't want to get wound up about physical fitness , but , you know , the one basic fact of life is that we arc physical beings , " Wilkinson said . " To say that you should he fit is not saying that you should he an athlete , that you should he able to start for Alabama . But it is saying that you 're going to age prema  --  turely and you 're going to sub  --  ject 3 ourself to debilitating ill  --  nesses if you do n't have a sound cardiovascular system . And the only way you can have that is to get the proper rest , rat reasonably well , and exercise a reasonable amount . I tr3 to play golf , handball , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , swim a little . I usual  --  ly work out two or three times a week . My own definition of a workout is veil simple and basic , and it 's this : You move vigorously enough to raise your pulse rate . You maintain that , and pretty soon you per  --  spire . And then you maintain vigorous movement for an  --  other ten or fifteen minutes . That 's what a workout is . It makes no difference what you do . Anything is better than nothing . " The Alabama team trotted out onto the field , and walk ing slowly behind them was Coach Bryant , exhaling clouds of cigarette smoke , as usual , and wear  --  ing his checked , narrow-brim hat . The Bear was squinting into the wind , and he looked preoccupied . He did n't have a lot to say to a little knot of well-wishers , mostly middle-aged men , who surrounded him in the end zone . He and Wilkinson , who arc old friends , greeted each other near the ten and strolled upficld . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gen  --  ius strategists would say to each other . ( What would Patton have said to MacArthur ? Clausewitz to ) All we heard was Bryant saying , " Bud , I just do n't know what kind of team we got . I do n't know how good we are this year . But I think we 're going to find out tomorrow . " The three of us stopped near the other end of the field and watched the scrimmaging in silence for a few min  --  utes . Bryant was not happy with what he saw , and he turned to NVilkinson and said , " Hell of a way to make a living , huh , Coach ? Watching a nine  --  teen- or twenty-year-old hot run down the field with your job ? " Wilkinson brought up the subject of the Nebraska Cornhuskers , who heat Alabama decisively in last year 's Orange Bowl game . For the past few days , there had been rumors of a re  --  match . The Bear was in no mood to he bothered with Nebraska . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . ( A few days later , it was an  --  nounced that Nebraska and Notre Dame would meet in the Orange Bowl . ) FRIDAY NIGH r THE weekly production meeting was held in a small conference room at the Parliament House Motor Hotel , where the A.B.C . crew was staving . Chuck Howard , a slim , in tense man in his late thirties , briefed the announcers and the production people on the plans foi the next day 's coverage . HOWARI. : Chris , I want you to re  --  ally hit hard on the importance of the game when we come on . You know , the old **30;4249;TOOLONG  --  pionship , two-undefeated-teams thing . Then , after you 've had , like , a minute for this , with the trains running on , and the hands and the cheerleaders and so forth , I want you to go down to Bill , who will talk about last week 's game . You know , " L.S.U. is unde  --  feated , but they almost were n't , and , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bill Flemming . " We go to you , Bill , and you 're to set exactly what it was -- the ) ' Iv behind sixteen to ten , two minutes and forty-five seconds to go , they drive the length of the field , and they score as time runs out . Then we conic back to Chris and Bud from there , with whatever you want to use to set the game , Bud . I think maybe we ought to talk about the two quarterbacks or the two contrasting of  --  fenses . WILKINSON : I think the depth of their offenses , too . HOWARD : Well , that 's right . Ala  --  bama is going to play three backfields . L.S.U. plays two . Pick one of the two points and make it , and if we 're lined up on the field with the player intro , we ma cut you short . In which case you have to make the other point after the opening kickoff . Now , what we ought to do , Andy , is have two freeze frames of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . At half time , a sta  --  tion break immediately followed by the campus footage of L.S.U. TERRY JASTROW : There 's only one band . No L.S.U , band . They called Monday and said , " We can save sev  --  eral grand if you guys will just tell us that you wo n't cover us . " When the planning was complete , Roger Goodman , the associate direc  --  tor , wheeled a blackboard over to the conference table and said , " Today 's weather slogan is ' Chuck . ' " He wrote " Chuck " on the blackboard in block letters and then began altering them . " You cross that , cross that , make a little box , right ? Cross that , a wheel there , a wheel here , another box , and you 've got a train , right ? And ' Train ' spelled backwards is ' Mart , ' right ? And now I want you to meet  --  Mart the Feather Girl ! " A waitress from the hotel 's Cork- Room , dressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " Is this Chris Schenkel ? , " kissed Schenkel on the forehead , and then ran out Wild applause , whistles , and stomping from the crew . SATURDAY AFTERNOON AHALFBACK takes a handoff. runs wide , and is just about to turn upheld , and then a linebacker shoots in from nowhere and nails him . When they show the play again on television , it 's from a different angle  --  an " isolated replay " focussed specifically on rite linebacker and showing all his moves before and during the play , The TV people could n't have known he would be involved in the play , so how did they get the shot ? In the case of the college games , the an  --  swer is that Chuck Howard has studied both teams well  --  he knows who the key players are and what they tend to do in certain situations . For instance , nn an obvious passing down he may reason that the offensive ream has had Hate success with its wide receivers and so this is a good time to pass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He gives the order to isolate on one of the running hacks , and as soon as the play is over , if he has guessed right , there on the screen is a shot of the hack faking a block and then swinging out of the backfield to take- the pass . During the game , in a trailer truck parked beneath the stadium , Howard sits in a miniature control room beside Andy Sidaris , the director , facing a wall of twenty mon  --  itors . Howard calls out the shots he wants to Sidaris , who is in touch with the cameramen . Sidaris must decide which cameras to use for isolation and which for live coverage . Howard also is hooked up electronically with several other production people and with Wil  --  kinson and Schenkel , who must he alerted for commercial breaks and re  --  plays , During the few minutes we spent in the truck on this afternoon , we were impressed by the way Howard and Sidi-His composed a smooth , coherent visual narrative out of the jumble of images before them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afternoon , enjoying the game . ( Both teams played very well , and Alabama won , 35-21 . ) The booth was a surprise . Watching football on television , we had imagined Wilkinson and Schenkel high above the noise and action , enclosed in glass , perhaps munching hot dogs during commer  --  cials  --  two friends chatting quietly about the game . Instead , all was noise and haste . The booth was completely open , and the racket from the Alabama fans was such that Wilkinson and Schenkel could hear themselves and each other only through their headsets . The base noise level , between Mays , was equal to what New York pro-football fans manage for a seventy-yard touchdown play . When some  --  thing happened , like a two-yard gain , the roar went up ; MC the jet-engine  --  **26;4281;TOOLONG range Wil THE NEW YORKER kinsnn and Schenkel seemed to he busy every second . College teams run quite a few more plays than the pros do , so there is a lot for the college-game an  --  nouncers to say and not much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plays , lie was looking at the field and at a monitor in front of him , con  --  sulting his notes about the players , marking the progress of the ball on a chart , and accepting the promptings of his spotter , Bill Friel . Friel sat on Schenkel 's right , following the game with binoculars ; on a roster of both teams he pointed out the names of play - ens who made tackles , punted , entered or left the game , and so on . Wilkinson was explaining plays , listening to replay cues from Howard , and keeping track of errors ( fumbles , penalties ) and of net punt yardage . 1Vilkinson had writ  --  ten out two small charts for himself , one showing the Alabama offense versus the L.S. U. defense , the other the L.S.U. offense versus the Alabama defense . This is what one of the charts looked like : L.S.U. OFFENSE I. Formations 1Valking I Split backs Slot Power I II .

Plan Rush effectively Use height Avoid breakaway SATURDAY NIGHT  --  THE GETAWAY FOLKS in Alabama like their foot- ball , and they like the TV people who cover their football . Since the A.B.C . people prefer not to linger after a game , the city of Birmingham helped them escape the stadium on this Satur  --  day by providing a police escort  --  a squad car and two motorcycles . The members of the crew checked out of their hotel before the game , and loaded part of their gear into a rented car and the rest of it into the squad car . The in  --  stant the game was over , the crew ran a power sweep toward the cars , with Wilkinson out front , showing some of the blocking form that won him fame at Minnesota . There was a moment of indecision at the cars  --  departure time of their flight was in twenty-five min  --  utes and that seemed impossible in all the traffic . The cops said do n't worry . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , swerves , honking , no braking , scones from " Bullitt . " They made it in fourteen minutes . Builder THE city got its first look at the new Uris Theatre , in the new Uris office building at 1633 Broadway , last week , and soon after that we got our first look at Harold D. Uris , who is president of the Uris Buildings Cor  --  poration and thus one of the impor  --  tant landlords of the cite . The Uris Theatre owes its existence to the new breed of zoning law , which cajoles de-elopers into adding " amenities " in ex  --  change for height bonuses and the like , and not to any spontaneous resurgence of theatre-building , and when we first called Mr. Uris , he was quick to set us straight on his involvement with Broad  --  way . " I 'm not in the theatre business , and I 'm not in the publicity business , " he said . " I 'm in the building business , and if you want to talk about buildings , come on over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Uris-owned building at 850 Third Avenue  --  where we found Mr. Uris , a gentle-spoken but forceful man in his sixties , sitting at a large , not quite rectangular confer  --  ence table . He was wearing a blue pin-sniped suit , black socks with white clocks , and a blue-and-white tie . His hair is rusty and his face is slightly rid . We immediately began to talk about Uris buildings . There are eight Uris ? owned office buildings in the city , in-chiding the I.T.T . Building at 320 Park Avenue , the Sperry-Rand Build  --  ing , the J.C . Penney Building , 2 Broadway , and 60 Broad Street , and there are three not quite finished Uris buildings , including the nearly com  --  plete building-with-theatre at 1633 Broadway and the building at 55 Wa  --  ter Street , which for a while will be the largest privately sponsored office building in the world , and we asked Mr. Uris if he had a favorite . " I like them all , " said Mr. Uris . " Would you ask me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like them all . Of course , some buildings arc better than other buildings . A definition of a very good building is a building with a very good balance sheet , and some buildings have better balance sheets than others . Uris buildings have good balance sheets . There is a tendency in this city to attack anyone who has the connotation of being a landlord , but the landlords are the city 's best customers . Last year , our buildings paid the chi thirty-five million dollars in taxes . I 'm sixtt - seven years old and I 've been in the building business for sixty - seven years . The way I learned the alphabet , B ' stands for bulldozer . My father was in the construction business , and my . ' brother Percy was in ) partner until he died , last year . My father 's firm was the Harris H. Uris Iron Works , on West Twenty-sixth Street . He made ornamental iron . Do you see this table ? The top of the table was part of a coal scuttle my father made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on the opening day of the ironworks , my father had been in this country only ten or twelve years . He came from a little town in Russia . My father was nut very literate , by American standards , but within ten years he had his ironworks . I have a wonderful picture . " Mr. Uris took us over to one wall to see a picture of opening day at his father 's ironworks . It was a fine pic  --  ture of a fine , simple brick building . Mr. Uris 's father and mother were off to the right . The employees of Mr. Uris 's father were ranged in front of the building in learbook fashion . Some stood on the building 's fire escape . There was a very pleasant feeling about the picture . " I do n't know , but I think that building 's still up , over on Twen  --  ty-sixth Street , " Mr. Uris said . On the same wall there were lots of other plctures , and plaques , and a certificate appointing him a trustee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a trustee of Columbia , and I 'm a trustee of Cornell , " Mr. Uris said . " There is a Uris Hall at Columbia , to which we donated quite a large sum of money , and there is a Uris Hall at Cornell . In evetything we did , my brother and I were always partners . It was one of the most beautiful relationships . I got out of college in 1925 , and I never bothered to go home . I took my valise straight to the office . We built a few buildings in the twenties . In 1930 , we were flat on our hack , but it never occurred to us Ave would n't make it . During the war , we built housing for the govern  --  ment , and that 's the only thing we built that I was ever ashamed of . That stuff was so cheap . We built some of it for twenty-two hundred dollars a unit . Until 1947 , we built residential build  --  ings in New York-2 Sutton Place South , 930 Fifth Avenue , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buildings . " We asked Mr. Uris what he thought about people who criticized office build  --  ings and deplored their dominance of the city . " These people are very artistic , " Mr. Uris said . " I happen to believe that the interior of a building is much more important than the exterior . None of the architectural people agree with me . But you build a building for those who occupy it , not for those who stand across the street and look at it . We have always built good buildings . I wo n't say I am not a perfectionist , but my brother was a perfectionist . I ca n't help it if people think every building should be the Taj Mahal . "
