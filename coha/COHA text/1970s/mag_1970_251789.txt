THE LIFE AND LOVES OF MR . JIVEASS NIGGER by Cecil Brown . 213 pages . Farrar , Straus &; Giroux. $5.50 . <P> FRAGMENTS by Ayi Kwei Armah. 287 pages . Houghton Mifflin. $5.95 . <P> The new Jew in literature is black . The community of shared pain and perception that has informed the sensibilities of Jewish writers is now said to exist in its own cultural terms for the Negro writer . Two successful new novels by young black authors , each one showing different styles and talents , provide fresh proof of the assertion . The artistic concern of both is grounded on particular black responses to the universal quest for identity . <P> Cecil Brown , 26 , and Ayi Kwei Armah , 29 , have Ivy League backgrounds ( Columbia , Harvard ) , but they are more different than alike . Brown was born in North Carolina , where at 15 he was sharecropping five acres . Armah is a Ghanaian who returned to Africa after college to write . Brown 's character , " Mr. Jiveass Nigger , " is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trip to Copenhagen , he is so busy hustling the world that he has forgotten whether there is anything inside his put-on . Armah 's gentle protagonist , Baako Onipa , is a " been-to " -a Ghanaian who has returned from abroad-who finds that , while he has been learning to reject the jive of commercial civilization , the disease has taken corrupting root in his homeland . What links the two disparate men is their common discovery that their insides do not match the externals of their world . <P> Busy Bed . Since he is a black George Washington , Jiveass naturally can only tell lies . " I jive people if I do n't trust them , see , " he explains to a friend . And he can not trust anyone . Distrustful and predatory , he can not bring himself to tell even one person his right name . What he can bring himself to do is go to bed with everything female he sees . It is his chief way of relating because it is his most effective form of combat . The black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and " fighting every day with the foreknowledge that he can never be the victor makes him victorious every moment of his life . " <P> But , like every good jiver , he also has a deep streak of charm , and so does Author Brown . Taking the reader into his confidence in an extraordinary postscript , Brown suggests that the whole book is a jiver 's joke . George may be a caricature of the white man 's mythical black , the hustling swordsman who alone can bring true satiety to a woman . On the other hand , Brown addresses George in the postscript , too , saying : " You think that your acts have been lies , but you need to realize that your creator is not some white man , but a black brother , a Nigger , a jiveass very much like yourself . " Whatever else it does or does not do , Brown 's tall tale definitely proves that rippling waters can also run deep .                @ @ @ @ @
