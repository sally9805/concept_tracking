Of all the beneficiaries of the Second Vatican Council , Roman Catholic theologians were among the most blest . Before the Council , most of them seemed to be little more than academic valets to the Popes , limited to being apologists for the fixed doctrinal formulations laid down by the 16th century Council of Trent . When Vatican II opened the doors to modern scholarship , especially biblical research , theologians were quick to seize their new opportunities . Within a few short years , some of them were questioning everything from the church 's teachings on sexual ethics to papal infallibility - even such root doctrines as the nature of the Eucharist and the divinity of Jesus Christ . <P> The era of such unfettered speculation seems to be coming to an end - at least for theologians who want to be considered believing servants of the church . Last month in Rome , 27 members of the Vatican 's international Theological Commission used their fourth annual meeting to discuss how theologians could keep their intellectual pluralism within a unified faith . The trend was centrist . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the year before . The commission 's consensus : diversity can be allowed in forms of expression and formulation , but not in basic belief . The church needs a " missionary and pastoral pluralism " that allows for a " translation of the faith for diverse cultures , " said Commission Secretary Philippe Delhaye , of Belgium 's Louvain University , but it can not tolerate a " pluralism of rupture " that challenges faith and church authority . <P> Commission Member Yves Congar , a French Dominican whose own works were under suspicion in preCouncil days , emphasized that even a broadened Catholic theological spectrum can not mean " the coexistence of persons holding contrary views . " Catholic diversity can only embrace those who share " identical basic views but express them differently . " Roman Catholicism simply can not afford the kind of theological pluralism that liberal Protestantism has enjoyed , says Congar-a limitation , he admits , that is both a strength and a weakness . " My Protestant friends at the World Council marvel that we were able to achieve so much in four sessions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years to produce one document . We were able to do this because of our doctrinal unity . On the other hand , we will never have the ' spread ' theologically that they have had with Earth , Tillich , Bultmann and others . " <P> Some Catholic theologians including Moralist Bernard Haring have argued in recent years that they are part of the church 's evolving magisterium , or teaching power . Theological Commission members-who range from Bishop Carlo Colombo , Pope Paul 's favorite theologian , to progressives like Congar and German Jesuit Karl Rahner - now seem willing to accept a more tangential role . The Pope defined that role for them last month when he addressed them as " specialists of the science and of the intelligence of the faith . " As for the magisterium , Paul VI has made it clear over the years that he considers only the bishops and himself to possess the power " to tell the people what God asks them to believe .
