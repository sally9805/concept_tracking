Since its birth during the Depression , the Nation of Islam , better known as the Black Muslims , has preached that whites were " devils " and " human beasts . " Not any longer : from now on whites will be considered fully human . <P> The movement 's ideas about black separatism and supremacy gathered some momentum during the late 1960s . But times change , and the Muslims ' autocratic messiah , Elijah Muhammad , adopted a softer line before his death in February at 77 . Last week , at a mass rally of 12,000 of the faithful at Chicago 's McCormick Place , Elijah 's son and successor , Wallace D. Muhammad , made it official : the race-hatred theme is being shelved . Whites will even be permitted to join the sect , though no rush of recruits is expected . Said Wallace : " We have caught hell from the white man for 400 years , but we have grown to where if the white man respects us , we will respect him . " <P> Brain Trust . Reporting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 41 , spoke for 3 hours while protected by a phalanx of 100 Muslim guards . To underscore the new tolerant line , the Muslims had invited a host of white civic and church leaders to the rally , although few showed up . Since Wallace 's speech included several appeals for white money , the Muslims ' new liberalism may have as much to do with finances as social enlightenment . <P> Race aside , the post-Elijah Muslims are in for some changes . Wallace announced plans to form a brain trust of Muslim leaders across the country to seek solutions to social ills , a scholarship program for high school youths , and a center to treat mental illness . He has also appointed the movement 's first woman minister . While maintaining traditional Muslim secrecy about overall membership ( estimated at between 50,000 and 100,000 , though higher figures are often used ) , Wallace revealed the dollar dimensions of Elijah 's legacy : the Muslims have investments of $14.5 million in Chicago property and $6.2 million in farm land , while their stores , restaurants and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substantial amounts , but below previous guesses . <P> Wallace Muhammad 's apprenticeship was uneasy . He quarreled with his father and twice dropped out of the movement . Moreover , he does not have his father 's compelling personal force . But so far , at least , he appears to be holding off the fierce power struggle that had been widely expected to follow Elijah 's passing . Certainly , Muslim Spokesman Abdul Haleem ( Louis ) Farrakhan , the most charismatic figure in the movement today , is at pains to dispel rumors that he was moved from his potent Harlem base to the sect 's Chicago headquarters so that Wallace could keep a closer eye on him . At last week 's rally , Farrakhan was full of praise for the new messiah . " No other man holds the key to divinity , " he said . " There is no one wise enough to approach the shoelaces of Wallace D. Muhammad . "
