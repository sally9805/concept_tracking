Short people got no reason , Short people got no reason to live . <P> Singer-Writer Randy Newman 's hit single Short People has hit the Top Ten on the pop charts almost overnight . But along the way it has burned a lot of Americans who stand well under average height ( reckoned at 5 ft. 9 in. for men and just under 5 ft. 4 in. for women ) . Among other slurs , the song says that smaller folks have " little hands/ And little eyes/ And they walk around/ Tellin ' great big lies . " The Little People of America , a national outfit boasting 2,000 members who are 4 ft. 11 in. or under , has denounced the record . Irate callers in several cities have persuaded radio stations to stop playing it . At first , Newman , who is 12 in. too tall to qualify for the Little People , laughed off the criticism . Now he 's not talking at all , leaving his agent to insist that the lyrics are intended merely to ridicule prejudice of all kinds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the mark .
