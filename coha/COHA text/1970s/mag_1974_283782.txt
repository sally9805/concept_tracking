THE TALE OF KIEU by NGUYEN DU <P> Translated by HUYNH SANH THONG <P> 162 pages . Random House . $6.95 . <P> Somehow Viet Nam still haunts us . That unfortunate nation seems on the verge of full-scale war again , even though Henry Kissinger won the Nobel Peace Prize for the part he played in fashioning the precarious cease-fire that President Nixon called " peace with honor . " The U.S. Government , meantime , continues to play a major role in South Vietnamese affairs . <P> It is entirely appropriate , both for Viet Nam and the U.S. , that The Tale of Kieu , a long epic poem that has captivated the Vietnamese for more than 150 years , should now be published in English . Ho Chi Minh incorporated many lines from Kieu into his own poetry . Students in South Vietnamese high schools study it today just as English-speaking students study Shakespeare . In remote villages , mothers recite it to their children as moral instruction and entertainment . If Americans are to understand the Vietnamese and their war - even at this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begin . <P> Crying Cuckoos . The poem , based on a 16th century Chinese novel , is romantic , melodramatic and at times mildly erotic . Westerners will detect elements of The Perils of Pauline and The Story of O. The 3,525-line poem recounts 15 hellish years in the life of a young girl , Vuong Thuy Kieu . She is beautiful , talented , virtuous-and just headstrong enough to make her interesting in spite of her other sterling qualities . To help pay her family 's debts , Kieu sells herself into concubinage and is tricked into becoming a common whore in the house of a ruthless madam . Thereafter Kieu is ravaged , reviled and degraded by a host of villainous men and women . At last , after a rebel warrior who helped her obtain revenge is killed , Kieu throws herself into the Ch'ien-t'ang River . She is rescued by a Buddhist nun and finds peace in the contemplative life-only to be reunited unexpectedly with her family and her first love , a young nobleman named Kim Trong , whom she weds on condition that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Kieu than escapist melodrama . Written by a renowned Vietnamese classicist named Nguyen Du ( 1766-1820 ) , the poem in Vietnamese has a wide range of wordplay . The meter is a flowing iambic called luk-bat , full of rhyming and nearly as easy to memorize as a song . Much of this is unavoidably lost in the otherwise excellent English translation by Huynh Sanh Thong , a Vietnamese scholar who has lived in the U.S. all his adult life . Jaded Western readers who may find Kieu 's plight unconvincing can still enjoy the poem for its language , especially descriptions of people and nature : <P> Strange scenes and landscapes met his mournful eyes . <P> The cuckoos , perched on branches , cried and cried- <P> Geese winging homeward wrinkled heaven 's edge .
