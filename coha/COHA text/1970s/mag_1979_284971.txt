In a suburban house in Glassboro , N.J. , 21 miles southeast of Philadelphia , there stands a 72-year-old rattle-and-clank printing press . When Richard Mitchell , the doting owner and an English professor of 16 years ' service at Glassboro State College , is asked why on earth a man would want to buy his own press , his very own Chandler &; Price , he squashes his soft hat down on his head , raises one finger in a hark-the-angel gesture , and proclaims : " The spirit of Gutenberg stood before me and said , ' Mitch ... ' " At such moments Mitch looks a bit like a road-company version of Rex Harrison ( with glasses ) , called upon by God and central casting to reform a whole functionally illiterate world of Eliza Doolittles . And behind all the song and dance , he is not just kidding . <P> Woe unto wanton danglers of participles ! The professor and his faithful press are out to save the English language , with a fire-and-brimstone fury quite beyond the droll tut-tutting of Edwin Newman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ militant clatter , pumping from his venerable machine 1,800 copies of the latest issue of the Underground Grammarian , which must rank as the most inflammatory broadsheet to come out of Philadelphia since Tom Paine published Common Sense . <P> WARNING ! the first page of the first issue shouted in January 1977 . RAPE OF THE MOTHER TONGUE WILL BE PUNISHED ! The declared policy of the editor-reporter-printer is to " expose and ridicule examples of jargon , faulty syntax , redundancy " and any " outrage against English " practiced by Glassboro State memo writers , especially those in high places . <P> Mitch disemboweling a culprit in print is a sight only brave readers should witness . " Some of the stuff we have to read causes cramps and vertigo , " he mutters , warming himself up to a fine frenzy over " the works of Scriblerus X. Machina , " as he dubs the bulletins from the chairman of the college 's communications department , or perhaps the " feats of Clay , " as he cruelly pun-points the communiqus of one Glassboro dean . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " might well cause irreversible brain damage . " But he risks it . One writer 's offenses against God and good English , pretty much the same thing to Mitch , are carefully totted up : seven " comma faults , " three " failures " of subject-verb agreement , two unpardonable cases of " purple fustian . " The villain is hoist by his own " demonstrable inanities . " To quote is to destroy-so goes Mitch 's modus operandi . <P> Then comes the general commentary . Adjectives like " pretentious , " " sleazy " and merely " stupid , " nouns like " gibberish , " " bunk " and " rubbish " fly from the page like hot spittle . The world suddenly becomes overrun with " boobs " and " nitwits " and " barbarians " and their synonyms : " vice presidents , " " curriculum developers " and , above all , " educationists " who have made careers out of not teaching Johnny to read while not learning to write themselves .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
