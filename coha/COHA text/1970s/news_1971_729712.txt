Here he interviews the orchestra 's music director , Georg Solt ! , who relates his feelings about the triumphal tour . In the new Arts &; Fun section in today 's TRIBUNE Willis tells the story of Hans Ulrich Schmid , the man who dealt with the endless details necessary to planning and then moving the orchestra thruout Europe . BY THOMAS WILLIS Chicago Tribune Prose Service ) LONDON , Oct ** Solti did n't want to leave her father last Wednesday morning and I 'm sure the feeling was mutual . For the first time since the Chicago Symphony Orchestra 's European tour started , the music director , Georg Sold , had had eight hours of sleep . The garden of their two-story townhouse in exclusive St. John 's Wood here glistened with dew o sunny , cloudless day , and Gabrielle , 17 months and a few days old , is a seductive little charmer with man-killer eyes and a mind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father or not , would leave her unchaperoned . But business is business and , besides , it was getting on toward nap time . There was a last , short game of peek-aboo , with father sneaking up on mother and daughter to the accompaniment of delighted shrieks of laughter and the family man once again returned to work . Season to Open in Chicago We adjourned to the tiny garden studio behind the fenced-off , empty swimming pool to spend a quiet hour discussing the 25-concert , 16,000-mile marathon which had concluded with tumultuous ovations the night before in Royal Festival Hall . It really was too early to start putting the tour in perspective , but he would try : " It is like an athlete in a race , you know . You keep trying right up to the finish line , and then you collapse . I feel empty and tired , sad that it is over , and reluctant to start thinking about the new season opening in Chicago next Thursday . " In a way , the tour has been like a big wedding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and six weeks going thru with , the celebration . Now we have to go back to work . But never mind , a few more good nights ' sleep and I will feel like going again . " , The pensive , penetrating eyes leveled into motionlessness , as tho he was reading a distant script or score across the crowded room . " I was sitting right here with John Edwards , your general manager , when ft all started , " he said . " I knew the orchestra was as good as it is from guest conducting appearances with it , knew its virtuosity and marvelous homogeneity of its instrumental choirs , knew the discipline and integrity of its work . And I also knew that this wonderful instrument was totally unknown in Europe except to connoisseurs . Nobody really knew except the people in Chicago , and , as I found out later , only the musicians in Chicago , not the general public . As one of my friends in the orchestra said : ' We are the best provincial orchestra in the world . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he becomes intense , Solti 's voice lowered to a sibilant , slightly theatrical whisper . " We set out on this tour to change that image and I think we can really say that this changed . Whatever differences of opinion there have been about this or that interpretation of mine or of Carlo Maria Giulini 's , the chorus has always been the same . Either this is the best American orchestra or that this is probably the best symphonic ensemble in the world , Which I absolutely believe . " I think we have Created a legend something like the loll tour of Arturo Toscanini 's NBC Orchestra , Which created an absolute furor of excitement . Then as now , people said the Americans have n't enough heart , Have n't enough soul , or do n't play enough wrong notes . They called the ensemble a machine , said it played ' too perfectly . ' But they also said they would hover forget that ToSeanini virtuoso sound , and they have been saying it for 90 years . Sensation Is Unmatched " I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Europe since and created such a Morel . " There was an interruption , Ito , the girl who looks after them in London and keeps ad eye on the house during the nine months of the year they are out of town , was looking for the tickets for the boat train . The orchestra was flying home that afternoon , but the Soltis are coming by ship as far as New York City to relax . After fishing out the tickets from a cluttered desk ? " No , I 'd better do it , my own mess I know , yours would confuse me " ? he picked up the thread without dropping a stitch : " For two things I am really grateful . First , for They being associated with these men . ey behaved immaculately . There was not the slightest seed ? or disturbance . No Union Trouble " I knew the history of the union negotiations and how tough they were to conclude . I knew how much in the past these players distrusted conductors and the management . But there was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there would be letdowns in some of the performances , as the men became aware of which concerts were most important . Tins did not happen . In Milan , I even told them to take it a little easier on the second and third nights , because we had such a hard week coming up . But they did n't do it . " Again the whisper . " This is very wonderful and I am very proud . " Solti also expressed his gratitude to the people in Chicago who gave the money for the tour . Everyone Contributed " I know there were contributions from the city and from the state , and I hope this will not be a single event , but the bulk of the money came from citizens , individuals and corporations . This is really wonderful . It could not happen in Europe , you know , at least not any more . " The highlight of the tour ? The London audience , which Solti termed simply unbelievable . " I know there were a lot of special things to be considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tine I had conducted here since June and I have a certain ' simpatico ' relationship with a certain audience here . But the tranquility of this public is absolutely marvelous . We perhaps had more cheers in Paris or Vienna or Hamburg , I think so . This audience , tho , was so quiet you could hear yourself breathing on the podium . Its capacity for listening is unequalled anywhere . And with four good orchestras of their own as well as opera and recitals , they know what they 're listening to . " Audiences Receptive All of the audiences were surprisingly interested and receptive , he found . With ticket prices necessarily high , he expected a sizable leavening of people who came to be looked at , not to listen . But if they were present , they never made ' themselves known in their customarily inattentive ways . No fidgets , coughs , or foot shuffilngs marred any performance . No bon-bons were unwrapped in slow movements . No bracelets jingled . No one whispered or wrote notes . Even in Milan , where Solti @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposite turned out to be true . They came to listen and stayed to cheer . Solti , along with several others lb the tour party , at first thought those cries from the Teatro Alla Scala 's top two galleries were boos of disapproval . Language Barrier " I was absolutely shattered the first night , " he recalled . " From the stage , it sounded exactly like ' boo , boo . ' Afterward someone told me they were shouting ' bis , ' the Italian request for an encore . When they 're displeased , they whistle . So the next night we played an encore and everything was fine . " There were one or two real boos at the concerts in Berlin and Hamburg , for reasons still not entirely clear . " I do not think the two situations were related , " Solti explained . " Berlin is very radical . For a year or so , now , they tell me a small group has been making a disturbance at any concert which has a ' star . ' They even booed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other times , they shout " bravo " in all the most unlikely places . " Speculates on Reason " It seems to be some kind of antiestablishment protest . Of course it could have something to do with the recent Russian-American discussions . " In Hamburg , a group of four or five students apparently bought tickets to all of the visiting orchestra concerts last season and booed at each finale . " Generally , the audience behaved as it did with us , trying to shout the dissenters down , " Sold said . " I was really upset , tho . It was unpleasant and unfair and I wish someone had warned us ahead of time . " Communications Breakdown Along with several members of the orchestra , Solti was distressed with another end-of-concert discourtesy , in all likelihood caused by poor communionlions within the organization . SevertI times during the tour , the audience would be shouting and clapping its approval . There would be several callbacks for the conductor , who would beckon the orchestra , es is customary , to stand in acknowledgment . Thkb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conductor would take the concertmaster by the hand and lead him offstage , followed by the rest of the men . In London , Berlin and Vienna , the break-up occurred just as the ovation was cresting . " The audience must have thought we were bored with their applause , or that the conductors wanted it all for themselves , " Solti continued . " But our union contract , which I did n't know about when I was planning the programs , says the players must leave the stage two hours and 15 minutes from the announced starting time of the concert or pay overtime , In Europe , no one starts on time and intermissions are long , to give the audience tithe to relax , buy a drink or snack , and stroll or chat . When the time came , we had to leave , that 's all there was to it . Next time , we 'll have to have shorter programs and play an encore . " " Never-Ending Joy " But all in all , Solti found the tour the most exciting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " It was absolutely fantastic how every time we came into a new hall , the music sounded different , " he said . " My favorite halls were Goteborg and Vienna . Berlin , which I remembered as superb , seemed this time to have a kind of ' electronic ' quality , and the presence of people on all sides was disturbing . " La Scala is not a concert hall , but RS visual beauty Is unrivalled . And everywhere , the orchestra without rehearsal sized up the acoustical situation and made adjustments within the first 10 minutes or so of the concert 's beginning . " Side Trips Told All of the joys were not found in the concert hall . Outside of working hours there was time for reunions With old friends in Munich , a midnight supper With Rolf Liebermann , %Mont Spill joins as " musical adviser " at the Paris Opera in two seasons , a visit to the Toscold Palazzo at the invitation of , his daughter and , a side trip to Montreux , where amid fanfares and firelight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promised hour drew to a close , &Ill's; conversation turned again to Chicago . " You know , the men in the orchestra will never be the same again , " he predicted . " In so many ways , their horizons have been broadened . The life they had on the continent was a bit glamor- . ous of course . This is n't really the way life is for symphony men in Europe . Our touring players had the best of both worlds  --  living in the high American standard of comfort and playing for the receptive and knowledgeable European audiences . It was a kind of dream situation , really . " Now there is the Chicago season to think about and the new series in New York City , for " We have to fight for our place in America , too , of course . " 1979 Tour Planned " And in 1979 , it will be about time to return to Europe to ' cement ' our reputation there , " he said . " For that trip , there will have to be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go down well with the normally conservative European audiences and brilliant enough to show off the orchestra 's virtuosity . Hopefully , the recording session will come at the end , when everyone is amply rehearsed . " Speaking of the future , our music director had quickened his pace . Another reporter was waiting in the wings and there was a luncheon date ahead . The fatigue lines , still present as our conversation began , seemed to have vanished . The morning after . was over . Like Gabrielle upstairs in her crib , Solti was once more awake and looking ahead .
