Stumping Louisiana , a newly confident Ronald Reagan talked with TIME National Political Correspondent Robert Ajemian . Excerpts : <P> <P> Q. Until now you have been unwilling to predict that you would win the Republican nomination . Why do you now say you can beat Gerald Ford on the first ballot ? <P> <P> A. After four straight primary victories , I decided to say what I 've really thought in my mind . People needed to hear me say that ; so do all the uncommitted delegates . I believe I 'm the only candidate who can beat Jimmy Carter , if he does win . <P> Ford made his first big mistake with me when he said publicly that I should get out of the race . That was at our low point , right after the Illinois defeat . Everybody was telling me to get out . As soon as I heard the Ford remark I knew it would backfire on him . I repeated it to every audience in North Carolina , and it helped us . Now we 're really rolling . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ White House . <P> <P> Q. Why do you consider yourself a stronger candidate than Ford ? <P> <P> A. Ford has shown he is unable to go past his old friends in Congress and to the public . He does not rally people or sell his programs . He just blames Congress . Besides , with Ford as the nominee , Republicans would have to defend a candidate who 's been responsible for the biggest budget in our history , who 's let our military strength erode , who 's done nothing to reduce bloated Government . Carter would not be able to use those arguments against me . <P> <P> Q. Is n't the divisiveness between you and Ford surely leading to a bitter , bloody convention ? <P> <P> A. I think the divisiveness has come from him . He has repeatedly done one thing and said another . And then he attacks me for pointing out the inconsistencies . Take Cuba . I know that since last May we 've been warming up to Castro , including trying to influence the Organization of American States . Suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Miami that Castro is an international outlaw . In North Carolina , he made strident statements against gun control at the same time that his Attorney General was pushing a gun-control bill through Congress . On Panama , he denied in Texas that we were giving up any rights to the Canal . Then we learn from Ambassador Ellsworth Bunker 's congressional testimony that he 's been negotiating it away . <P> I was n't prepared for the false denials or the personal attacks . Why should n't I speak back when he calls me glib and irresponsible and worse ? I hope he wo n't keep it up . We better set our sights on the election . <P> <P> Q. The President 's campaign staff contends that your string of primary victories last week was due to Wallace supporters who voted for you . Do you agree ? <P> <P> A. What are they complaining about ? On the one hand the Ford people claim my base is too narrow , a small minority within the party . When I attract Democrats and independents and blue-collar voters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Republicans absolutely can not win in November without those voters . <P> <P> Q. If you are the nominee , and Carter is your opponent , what will be the principal issues ? <P>
