 | PS guide to compact 35 's Do you always carry a camera ? I do ? to be prepared for that " oncein-a-lifetime " picture that otherwise I 'd miss . Lately , I 've been taking along one of the new compact 35mm 's . Small and light , it rides easily in a pocket or on its strap under my jacket . It has proved a very satisfactory , even impressive , performer , especially in candid shooting . You might say that , in 50 years , 35mm cameras have come full circle . The first one , the 1926 Leica , was pocketably small ? its reason for being . But , as more and more features were added , the 35 lost its miniatureness . Now a new breed of compact 35mm cameras is gaining in popularity . Unlike the little half-frame 35 's that enjoyed a brief vogue in the Sixties , these feature full-frame 35mm format : 24x36mm . Compact 35 vs. pocket 110 For most people , the ideal camera is one small and light enough to be carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy to use . While pocket 110 cameras would seem to fill the bill , they have drawbacks . The 110 's subminiature 16mm format is a real disadvantage . Its frame size is only 13xl7mm , compared to 24x36mm for full-frame 35mm . Obviously , for the same size screen or print image , 110 takes more blowing up than does 35mm , and loss of picture quality is in-@# @# evitable . Also , the choice of films in 110 is very limited , while the costs of film and processing are the same as for 35mm . Except for the simplest models , 110 pocket cameras are not significantly smaller than some compact 35 's . Their big plus is ease of loading : You just drop in the film cartridge . For a 35mm , you have to thread the film leader into the camera 's takeup spool . It takes about as much skill as tying your own shoelaces . Something for everybody One of these compact 35 's should serve well as the only camera of the occasional picture-taker , whose chief hobby is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the advanced amateur or professional photographer when he even a window in back to tell you if carera is loaded , and with what film . ca n't be encumbered with his regular equipment . Our buyer 's guide on a following page compares the features and prices of 30 current-model compact 35mm cameras . Generally they 're smaller than five by three by 21 , inches and weigh one pound or less . None will strain a jacket pocket . Although most have coupled rangefinders , some models are zone-focusing . Automatic exposure control is almost universal . The lens usually is f /2.8 , has a focal length of 38 or 40mm ( shorter than " normal , " yielding a wider view ) , and is noninterchangeable . Prices range from around $100 for the GAF Memo 35EE , Konica C35V , and Ricoh 35ZF to more than $500 for the Leica CL . Which compact 35 is for you ? Let 's discuss some of the major features . @# @# @#  | Rangefinder or zone focus With a lens-coupled rangefinder , you turn the focusing ring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ viewfinder merge . Zone /scale focusing requires that you either align an index with the symbol that represents your subject , from head-and-shoulders portrait to distant scene , or estimate the range and set the distance scale accordingly . Rangefinder focusing certainly is more accurate , and I feel that it is a must for serious photography . It can be argued that the considerable depth of field afforded by the short-focus lenses provides a generous margin for focusing error . However , most people are n't very good at guesstimating distances . Also , without the rangefinder image to remind you , it 's easy to for- get to change focus while you 're shooting . If you plan to make much use of the flashmatic feature ( which we 'll take up further on ) , bear in mind that , with it , pictures both out of focus and under- or over-exposed can result from inaccurate focusing . Only if a zone-focusing model has some feature that strongly appeals to you is the trade-off of rangefinder focusing worth considering . Examples : the unusually small size of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ C35EF , manual override of automatic exposure control in the low-priced Ricoh 35ZF . Price differences among comparable rangefinder and zone-focusing models are not significant . For instance , the Fujica GER rangefinder camera lists at $135 , while the otherwise-identical zone-focusing Fujica GE is only $20 less . To me , the rangefinder is well worth the difference . Exposure control All of the current compact 35 's have some kind of automatic exposure control ? with just three exceptions : The Leica CL has through-the-lens metering with manual control , a system familiar to users of single-lens reflex cameras , and one with wide professional acceptance . Do-it-yourself aperture/speed setting via a followpointer , visible in a top-deck window and not in the viewfinder , is the Rollei 35 and 35S way . Although some may accept this as @#  | part of the price for the Rollei 's unique smallness , I consider it an old-fashioned and inconvenient arrangement . The trend seems to be toward a programmed system with completely automatic exposure control . In this , the combination of lens aperture and shutter speed is selected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you press the shutter release . More than half of the cameras listed employ this system . Two other systems allow you to select either aperture or speed ( with manual override of the automatic function provided in some cameras ) . With automatic aperture control ( shutter priority ) , you set the shutter speed and the electric eye sets the lens aperture . The roles are reversed with automatic shutter control ( aperture priority ) , with you setting the aperture . In either case , the automatic setting is indicated by a finder readout . Personally , I 'd choose to handle shutter-speed selection myself , thus assuring a speed fast enough Built-in pop-up electronic flash with automatic exposure control , even for fillin use , makes zone focusing Konica C35EF unique among compact 35's. to stop action or possible camera shake . When shutter speed is automatically controlled , a light change while you 're shooting fastmoving subjects can cause an automatic shift to a shutter speed too slow to stop action . And , working quickly , you might not notice the change in readout . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better results if he can exercise at least partial control over exposure . In practice , however , I have found that fully automated cameras do very well indeed . Automation is especially welcome to me in candid photography , where grab shots are usual and I might miss a great picture while fiddling with settings . If you 'd rather do it yourself , the Leica CL offers the most sophisticated manual exposure-control system around . Next best ? at a lot less money ? are the shutterpriority automatics with manual override : Canonet GIII-17 , Olym-@#  | pus 35RC , Ricoh 500G and 35ZF . Regardless of the type of expoure-control system and whether or . ot the shutter is " electronic " speeds electronically timed ) , your camera should have an exposure ange of 1/2 to 1/500 second or broader to cover a wide variety of icture-taking conditions . The selom-used " B " setting for longer exposures is not essential , but can come in handy once in a while . The same goes for a self-timer . Automatic flash exposure If you often take flash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flash connection ? is a must . When the camera is in flash mode , with guide number for your : lash/film combination set , the exposure meter is uncoupled and the lens diaphragm is coupled with the focusing ring . Thus , as you focus , the aperture is changed automatically to match the flash-to-subject distance ( with flash on camera ) . Focus carefully , and it 's easy to get properly exposed flash pictures . And you can use a cheap and simple electronic flash unit for results as good as a costlier automatic unit would deliver . Balanced daylight synchro flash is a unique feature of the Konica Auto S3 and C35EF models . In the former , matching the meter needle with the synchro-flash bar which moves as you focus ) balances flash and ambient light for more effective fill-in , outdoors or in brightly lit indoor situations . The Konica C35EF provides similar control automatically . Lenses Most photographers will find that the usual f/2.8 lens is fast enough . However , if you expect to do much shooting at low light levels , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ /2 class : Canonet GIII-17 f/1.7 ) , Konica Auto S-3 ( f/1.8 ) , Leica CL ( f/2 ) , Minolta Hi-Matic E ( f/1.7 ) , Olympus 35DC ( f/ 1.7 ) , Petri ES Auto 4/1.7 ) , Yashica Electro 35CC ( f/1.8 ) . The 38 to 40mm focal-length lens common to most compact 35 's is fine for most purposes ? but keep your distance for portraits . Threequarter and full-length poses are best , because in closeups the shortfocal-length lens can distort features unattractively . Being able to switch to an 80 or 90mm lens for such pictures would be ideal , but only the $540 Leica CL currently offers lens interchangeability ( its Elmar-C 90mm  | f/4 is $285 ) . Expected on the U.9 market in 1976 , the new Voigt lander VF102 ( it may wear a Rol , lei nameplate when it gets here I will offer interchangeable 40mi1 and 80mm lenses . Finder readout All of the compact 35 's have bright-line frame outlining the pie ture area ; most have parallax-cona pensation marks to keep you front cutting off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GIII-1 : , Leica CL , Minolta Hi-Matic E , and Vivitar 35CA offer automatic par allax correction as you focus ( vertical only in the latter camera ) . Symbols in the finder of a zonefocusing camera make it easier to use ( Fujica GE , Konica C35V , Konica C35EF , and Yashica Electra 35MC ) . In a rangefinder camera the dual images should be clew and easy to align . In a camera with aperture-priority or shutter-priority exposure control , a scale providing a readout of the automatic function is essential . However , with programmed ; automatic exposure control , all you really need is an under/over exposure warning or a long-exposure signal ? you ca n't do anything about the exposure anyway . Which is best ? The truth is , they 're all good Any of the current models , properly used , will produce excellent pictures . Best for you is the camera that has the features you need and feels right in your hands . However , one camera clearly is best : the Leica CL . It 's the only professional-grade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a CL with 40mm and 90mm lenses , I 'm convinced that with it I could cover at least 90 percent of my assignments . Still , the Leica CL hardly qualifies as the best buy in the compact 35mm field . I think that the $135 Fujica GER deserves that rating An advanced design , this well-made coupled-rangefinder camera has programmed automatic exposure control , 1/800 to 4 second electronic shutter , long-exposure warning . flashmatic , and a fine Fujinon 38mm f/2.8 lens . The viewfinder is bright and uncluttered ; the rangefinder image is clear and easy to align . After using one for several months and taking a lot of good pictures with it , I can recommend it highly .
