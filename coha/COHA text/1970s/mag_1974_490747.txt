THE TALK OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment TO anyone who happens to be interested in the varieties of facts and alleged facts , the White House scandals have turned out to be an inexhaustible source of new and striking specimens . There have been " offensives , " " operations , " and other military maneuvers carried out by means of facts ; there have been facts that disintegrated as soon as they were looked at ; and there have been facts that broke down like cars on the road and became inoperative . Last week , we all had our first introduction to still another species of fact  --  the Unrevealed Fact . Senator Hugh Scott said on television that he knew of facts that would " exculpate " the President . But Scott was n't saying what the facts were . The distinguishing mark of the Unrevealed Fact is that it is launched into the world in an incorporeal state . Two days later , Vice-President Ford picked up Scott 's theme . He , too , knew of the amazing facts . But Ford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I have n't had time to read the information , " he explained . Ordinary facts are straightforward things . An Unrevealed Fact acts upon the world circuitously . It is known only to a few initiates , who then bring the rest of us the good or had news . Ordinary facts are brash . Unrevealed Facts are shy and mysterious . But they can be powerful . They can permeate the atmosphere with their occult influence . The ones that Senator Scott has seen are alleged to have the power to move a mountain of wrongdoing and release the whole nation from its torment . They could do for our President what almost a year of information in the public realm has been unable to do . The facts on the record betray him , but the Unrevealed Facts exculpate him , and he stands blameless in their miraculous , forgiving glow . On the Street VINCENT TAYLOR , a native of Trinidad who came to New York seven years ago , is a street musician who can attract a crowd just by unpacking his instrument . Taylor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which are often mistakenly referred to as " steel drums . " The mistake hs understandable , since the pans are made from the steel tops of empty oil drums ( which are numerous these days ) . The instrument is played with wooden mallets , and it is actually much closer to the marimba , or even to the glockenspiel , than to the snare drum or the bass drum . Steel instruments of this type originated in the West Indies after the Second World War . Most West Indian musicians  --  even those from other islands  --  agree that the first man to make beautiful music with the tops of empty oil drums was a Trinidadian named Ellie Mannette , who created his first instrument in 1947 . Within a few years , there were " steel bands " all over the island , and the sound quickly spread throughout the Caribbean . Vincent Taylor , who was horn in 1944 , grew up with the new music . In his early teens , he apprenticed himself to a professional bandleader , who taught him not only how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The tenor pans that Taylor trundles around Manhattan in a big black case took him about six weeks to make . This is how he did it : First , he drove out to New Jersey and bought a couple of brand-new steel barrels ( the fifty-five-gallon size ) . Then he cut off the tops with an electric saw , leaving a five-inch rim all around . Then he took a hammer and a metal punch ( a kind of chisel with a blunt end ) and laboriously pounded each steel top until it bellied down into a smooth , bowllike curve , about five inches deep in the center . When a concave metal surface like this is suspended in the air and struck with a wooden mallet , different areas reverberate at different frequencies . For " fine tuning , " Taylor wielded the hammer and punch with greater precision , forming a pattern of dents and bumps that divided the surface into particular " notes . " ? Vhen he was finished , the double tenor pans could reproduce three octaves of the piano keyboard . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inches long with fat rubber bands wound tightly around the striking ends . One day last week , just before noon , Taylor unpacked his instrument on the north side of Forty-second Street , opposite Bryant Park . A crowd of about twenty people gathered to watch as he suspended each steel pan between a pair of chromium cymbal stands ( the only part of his gear that he did not make himself ) . Then he put an empty tissue box on top of his carrying case , picked Fast Side and still makes instruments , for other musicians and for schools across the country ? ) Taylor is also convinced that playing on the street is making him " a better player . " " Some artists imetrat perform on the street , " he says . " They do n't have the social confidence . The whole atmosphere on the street is different . It 's a much harder audience . In the theatre , people come just to hear you ; they 're all ready to he pleased . On the street , you have to he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up a mallet in each hand , and started to play . Taylor has a varied repertoire , which runs from the classical ( Chopin 's " Bolero " and Tchaikovsky 's " None but the Lonely Heart " ) , through standard calypso ( " Ye/love Bird " and " Marianne " ) , to Broadway show tunes ( " Maria " and " The Impossible Dream " I. He also plays his own compositions , which he is in the process copyrighting . But no matter what he plays the tone is always bright and gay  --  an irresistible blend of rinky-tink piano , harpsichord , and harp . Passersby stop in mid-stride and look around to see where the strange music is turning from . Some people push to the front of the crowd , stare at Taylor in disbelief , and push their way out again . But most remain for five or ten minutes , and there is always a hard core of admirers who ( like the wedding guest in " The Rime of the Ancient Mariner " ) seem to have forgotten completely about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , someone in the audience steps forward and drops money into the tissue box . n couple of nickels , a quarter , a dollar bill or two . After playing non-stop for nearly an hour , Taylor took a brief break , and we asked him how much money he makes during a good day on the street . He said , " About twenty-five dollars . Mat he thirty on a very good ( iu. " .. very good day for a street musician means warm , sunny weather and no trouble with the police . While there is no law against playing music on the street , there is a law against obstructing traffic . Taylor has hren arrested only once ( the judge dismissed the case ) , hut he is periodically told to pack up his instrument and move on . When this , liappens , he usually moves to one of his other favorite spots around town , such as the northwest corner of Fortieth Street and Fifth Avenue or the plaza in front of the Metropolitan Museum of Art . Like most street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he playing indoors in a sold-out hall . He has done a feM , club dates and concerts , and a couple of television commercials , and he entertains at private parties ( for twenty-five dollars an hour ) when he gets the chance . In lean times , he supports himself by driving a cab or a limousine . He keeps hoping that his constant exposure on the street will lead to a " big hrcak " of some kind . n the meantime , he feels that he is doing his part  --  along with a handful of fellow West Indians who play steel instruments on the street to acquaint a whole new audi-ence with the music of his native island . ( How many New Yorkers know that the legendary Ellie Mannette , the father of the steel band , lives on the lower An Arrest OUR friend Maris Cakars committed an act of civil dis-obedience some weeks ago and got arrested for it . Normally , that would n't he anything to make a fuss over , since Mr. Cakars is a radical pacifist who gets arrested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes this a man-bites-dog story is that lie was in the Soviet Union at the time . He was arrested for distributing leaflets at GUM , the big Moscow de-partment store , and the cops involved were from the K.G.B. , not from the F.B.I . or the N.Y.P.D. Cakars gave us a rundown on his Moscow adventures when we had lunch with him the tither day , and we 'll get to that in a moment . First , some background on the teller of the tale . Maris Cakars was horn in Latvia in 1942 , spent a couple of years in displaced-persons camps in Germany , and moved to Long Island with his parents after the war . Then came some ups and downs , the latter including a bout with heroin , from which he was saved lin the stabilizing influences of the peace movement and of Susan Kent , now Susan Cakars . ( Their son , Janis , is almost two . ) Cakars is the editor of Win , a magazine that is loosely af-filiated with the War Resisters League . He changed Win @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Side , to a twenty-cent weekly , published out of a barn in Rifton , New York , near New Palm Win survived the nineteen-sixties in good health ( its circulation is now six thousand , an allTHE NEW YORKER 29 time high ) , because , unlike many other radical publications , it never lost its love of fun and it resisted the craze for romantic violence and Maoist doublethink . Mr. Cakars has long dark-blond hair and a full heard . He has a broad , humorous Slavic face , with small , Faintly Mongol eves , and his body is shaped like a can of beer . Cakars was in Moscow because the Russians were holding one of their periodic - World Peace Congresses and had decided , in the spirit of detente , to include a few non-Communist Party types among the three thousand or so delegates . Cakars and Grace Paley , the short-story writer , represented the - War Resisters League . They went in order to put in a word on behalf of Soviet dissidents and political prisoners , which , in the course of official @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take it from there . " I had picked up this stack of leaflets  --  they were Russian translations of an ad that ran in the Tinrcs during Brezhnev 's visit  --  at the W.R.L. office in New York on the way to the plane , and I did n't think twice about it , because I figured they 'd he seized by customs in Moscow and that would be the end of that . But no , it did n't work out that way . They did n't search us ; they just waved us through customs . I did n't think much about the leaflets For the duration of the congress , but toward the end I decided that the worst thing I could do would he just to leave them in my hotel room , because then I 'd go down on a blacklist without accomplishing anything at all . " Now , in Moscow , GUM is the place to be . The crowds there are terrific . It 's like Macy 's and the Essex Street Market combined . All these little stalls off to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not , of course . There 's a terrible shortage of political material in the Soviet Union . At the congress , if anybod ) ever showed up with any kind of leaflets to give out he was mobbed  --  just the opposite of the way it is in the U.S. , where you try to avoid all these people with the latest correct line on everything . " I did n't want to get arrested , and I was too chicken to hand the leaflets out one by one . My plan was to put them in men 's rooms . I stuffed my jacket po  --  kets full of leaflets and put my overcoat on , and waddled nut of the hotel and over to GUM . I looked like a vein fat person . So I 'm wandering around GUM with my overcoat buttoned up , looking for a men 's room . I 'd researched how you write ' toilet ' in Cyrillic . I 'm wandering and wandering , and I ca n't find a piddarti men 's room . Then I decided I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and split . I left one hunch on a staircase , while I was there alone for a moment , and another on a counter . I got rid of most of them , but I still had a few left , and F saw an ideal spot It was a bon with a fire hose in it , just beneath a wall display of commemorative buttons . I wait , but there 's always somebody around , and I 'm sure there are thousands of eyes on me . " Finally , I S2y the hell with it , and I start walking out the exit , which is right nearby . Suddenly , another door opens and three men come out in a big hurry . Uh-oh . I just keep walking , but they yell ' Stop ! ' at me in Russian . I do n't know how you say ' stop ' in Russian , but I got their meaning . I made it through the first set of doors , but be-fore I got to the onts-de doors there was a hand on my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly I stopped being nervous and a sort of transcendental peace came over me , the way it always dues when I 'm in the hands of the authorities . " " Maybe you 'd have got into trouble if you 'd handed out leaflets in a department store in this country , too , " we said . " Maybe , but I did n't think those distinctions applied , " Cakars said . " Over there , it 's illegal to hand nut leaflets denouncing the state no matter where you do it , so I wend for the biggest crowds . Anyway , these goys took me to a little office that they had right there in the building . I had my I.D . from the congress , but none of them spoke any English , and I speak half a dozen words of Russian . They did n't speak Latvian , either ; I tried . They made a couple of phone calls , and then they heaved me up and pushed me and pulled me through the people at GUM , who must have thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They hustled me through the store , out the door , and through the snow and the mud to a conveniently located police station across the street . I relaxed when I saw the police station , because it was just like home . There was a drunk tank in the corner , with a couple of guys sleeping it off , and there were all these miserable people trying to get information out of bored cops who could n't care less . " They took me into an office , and we sat there for forty-five minutes waiting for someone to show up who could deal with a problem of this magnitude . They did n't have handcuffs ; they just held my wrists very firmly at all times . There was one guy who spoke a little German , and we passed the time in small talk ? Are you married ? Any kids ? What ages ? ' There was only one tense moment . I asked for a drink , and this guy pours a glass of water and conies up to me , and just as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pours it into the flowerpot . I thought , O.K. , rubber hoses are next , but he relented and got me a drink . I was prepared at that moment to spend a month or two in prison . It would have been kind of foolish of them to do it , but it seemed possible . I was also a little worried about my Latvian birth . / thought they might decide I was one of their own and entitled to the real punishment . For a Soviet citizen , what I did would be good for maybe five years in a labor camp . Siberia I was n't ready for . " Two very sharp-looking young guys who spoke English showed up and chased everybody else out . They were obviously a better class of policeman  --  upper-class , in fact . The guys that arrested me were working-class guys with fat hands . These sharp-looking guys started asking me questions about where I 'd left the leaflets , and they had me draw a map of the stare to show where I 'd left them . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cook my goose if I Ieft anything out . I embarked on my dumb act , where you say things like ' Oh , I did n't know there was a law against that . Gee ! I certain ) would n't want to offend the Soviet state ! ' They were n't writing anything down . Maybe they were taping it , but it seemed kind of informal . The main thing they spent a lot of time on was counting the leaflets . Roth guys had to count them  --  each one twice . There were seventy-one . " Then all sums of others started arriving . It was a fairly small room , and it started filling up with important people with important things to say . The phones start ringing , and everybody 's talking away in Russian , and I 'm just sitting there in the corner , completely forgotten . I asked them if they were policemen or just concerned citizens , but I never did find out precisely who they were . Finally , they threw me out of the mom , because I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the hall with the guy who had poured the water into the flowerpot . He was friendly by then , though . " Finally , a select collection of heavies , including the Russian liaison man with our W.R.L. delegation , showed up , and we started working on a statement fur me to sign . We worked on it for a long time , getting , the addresses of all the police officials involved and a lot of other such information that struck me as completely irrelevant . Then we got to the part where we had to mention the leaflet . The title of the THE NEW YORKER leaflet was ' On the Occasion of Brezhnev 's Visit  --  American Dissenters Demand Amnesty for Dissenters in Communist Countries . ' We must have spent fifteen or twenty minutes worrying over that one . The problem was that they did n't want to sully Brezhnev 's name by having it part of the statement . The solution was to call the leaflet ' Reprinted from the New York Times of June 24 , 1973 . ' That was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting for us to get to the meat of the statement , where I recant and confess my right-opportunist revisionist tendencies , but it never came . The whole thing was very factual . It was just a question of my admitting that I had voluntarily turned over seventy-one leaflets to the authorities . I signed the statement , and that was it . They said , Here 's your passport . Go home . ' Some of the police officers were obviously angry at me , but as far as the official response was concerned , I ca n't complain . If I were treated that way every time I got arrested in this country , it would be fine with me . And I probably would he treated that way if I were a visiting Soviet dignitary . " ?

The gilded young man said , " You just ca n't swim in the Mediterranean anymore , and only fifteen years ago it was as pure as pure . " The gilded young woman said , " We 're talking about a mutual friend who lost ten million in the market last week . " The curmudgeon said , " I thought anyone could do that these days .

' But I was fifteen , and all I wanted was one lamb chop and some peas . " The gilded young man asked the old curmudgeon what he did with his weekends . " I 'm a Seventh Day Atheist " was the reply . During the tenerello di hor , e , canlachiaro , et seq. , Ambassador Angier Biddle Duke , the city 's new official greeter , presented a key to the city to Dino De Laurentiis , the producer of " Serpico ; " a baritone from La Scala sang several numbers ; and the Gruppo Folkloristico Scialapopolo from Capn did a brightly colored production number . " From ' The Buttered Bride , ' I think , " said the curmudgeon , ordering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front of the room to look over the crowd and to inspect an altarpiece that featured a sassy sugar swan , a chocolate tree trunk and two chocolate axes , and a Roman temple with architraves made of sugar cubes . The temple was stuffed with bonbons . The crowd was a large and dressy group , and we heard a great deal of Roman being spoken . Returning to our table , we found the gilded grapes deep in a discussion of the Oberoi chain of hotels in India . The curmudgeon polished off his second brandy Alexander and then polished off the youngsters . " Shall we all unmask ? " he asked them .
