txt The Carter administration wo n't push for further congressional action on " wage insurance " until after the Teamsters have finished their current contract negotiations , probably at the end of March . This new administration strategy is fraught with peril and opportunity . Continued delay could further damage chances for enactment of President Carter 's plan for providing limited tax cuts , if inflation exceeds 7% this year . to groups of workers whose pay goes up 7% or less . Every increase in consumer prices raises the potential cost of wage insurance and frightens Congressmen trying to balance the budget . If , on the other hand , the Teamsters agree to a pay raise within Mr. Carter 's voluntary 7% guideline , or close to it , the administration can claim that the prospect of wage insurance helped encourage restraint . Armed with a guideline Teamster settlement , the administration then could renew its quest for congressional passage of wage . insurance . Reversal of Strategy The decision to stop pushing for House action on wage insurance , at least until next month , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to win House approval during March to dangle the prospect of wage insurance before the Teamsters . But wage insurance has received such a rough going-over at the hands of the House Ways and Means Committee that administration strategists have concluded the less done the better with wage insurance before the end of the month . The proposal 's problems were illustrated yesterday when the committee narrowly rejected a move to kill wage insurance by deleting money for it from the budget . The vote was 19 to 17 . In effect , 19 Democrats voted to keep wage insurance alive by recommending that Congress include $2.5 billion for the program in its spring budget resolution , while 12 Republicans and five Democrats voted against including any money . But the shakiness of wage-insurance support was clear as three Democrats who voted to leave room in the budget said they have serious doubts about the program 's effectiveness in restraining inflation . Rep. James Jones of Oklahoma said he is n't convinced . " I 'm very skeptical. " said Rep. Sam Gibbons of Florida . " I have misgivings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committee 's chairman . But Rep. Ullman added : " We owe it to the President , at this point , to keep it in the budget . " Drafting Session Problems The administration had hoped that the Ways and Means Committee would go straight from budgeting to actually drafting a wage-insurance bill . But with support for wage insurance so thin , administration strategists have decided that a drafting session might serve only to further undermine whatever claim they might hope to make to the Teamsters that wage insurance is alive and well in Congress . Some Democrats who support wage insurance have , nevertheless , informed the administration that they 're worried about its potential cost to the Treasury . The administration estimate of $2.5 billion assumes that consumer prices wo n't rise more than 7.5% this year . But Ways and Means economists put the likely cost close to $6 billion , assuming an inflation rate of 8.5% . Under the administration 's original proposal , the estimated 44 million workers who qualified for wage insurance would have the first $20,000 of pay insured against inflation up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $600 under the program , and that payment , like the wages it replaced . would be taxable . To hold their congressional supporters together , administration planners have promised to look for ways to further limit the program to prevent a large loss to the Treasury . But whether this can be done without eroding labor union support for wage insurance is unclear . " If you want to cut it back , the chances of getting it through are considerably less , " Rep. Barber Conable of New York , the committee 's senior Republican , said yesterday . Thus , any discussions about new limits on wage insurance are likely to take place in private , at least until the Teamsters conclude their contract talks . Before agreeing to a revenue figure to recommend for fiscal 1980 , which starts Oct. 1 , the Ways and Means Committee rejected , 16 to nine , a Republican move to leave room in the budget to roll back Social Security taxes next January to the levels scheduled before the most recent increases approved by Congress . Democrats called the move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increase scheduled for 1981.
