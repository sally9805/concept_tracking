WHEN they look in the mirror of their own lives , a majority of Americans-black and white , young and middleaged , male and female , working-class and professional-are reasonably content with their present lot and confident that it will improve . When they look out of the window beyond their neighborhoods , they are less pleased with what they see . They worry about rotting cities , lurking muggers , rising prices and polluted water . They are skeptical about the Government 's ability to be of much help . <P> That is one of the central conclusions of a forthcoming book called State of the Nation , produced by Potomac Associates Inc. and edited by William Watts and Lloyd A. Free. * The study that detected a " bifurcated mood of personal progress but national doubt " is based on an exhaustive poll of 1,806 Americans conducted last June by the Gallup organization for Potomac . Gallup asked each subject 87 questions in an attempt to capture people 's estimates of their own status as well as society 's . <P> Each person interviewed , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at large on a ten-rung " ladder of life . " It was up to the individual to define the ladder in terms of factors that affect him . With zero representing the worst possible life and ten the best , the personal responses averaged 6.4-well above the middle rung . When asked to look back five years , the interview subjects saw themselves standing at only 5.5 . They envisaged a step up to 7.6 five years from now . The same trend was apparent in different income , race and age groups . Blacks and the young , though positioning themselves lower on the ladder at present , were even more optimistic about their personal futures than the general average . The same people saw no such progress for the nation as a whole . They put the U.S. at 5.6 five years ago and at 5.5 today , though they did envisage an improvement to 6.2 by 1977 . <P> In exploring specific points of concern and discontent , the Potomac survey , like others , found that public interest has turned inward in recent years . Inflation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the list of worries . Viet Nam was only fifth . Communism as a threat at home or abroad ranked twenty-second . Only 52% favored coming to the defense of America 's major European allies should they be attacked by the Soviet Union ; just 43% favored an armed defense of Japan if attacked by either Russia or China . A resounding 73% agreed with this statement : " We should n't think so much in international terms but should concentrate more on our own national problems and building up our strength and prosperity at home . " <P> Exactly where should the emphasis be placed in improving American life ? According to the poll , Americans have a definite order of preference in spending public money . Controlling crime should come first , followed by helping the elderly , coping with drugs and addicts and cleansing the water and air . National defense , space exploration and foreign aid came in last in that order ( see chart ) . Americans also have some firm and relatively sophisticated ideas about how money should be spent in particular areas :  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
