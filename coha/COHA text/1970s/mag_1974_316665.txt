Philosophical principles aside , how can one tell the difference between Republicans and Democrats ? Tongue in cheek , the newsletter of the Republican Congressional Committee presents some handy hints : <P> " Democrats buy most of the books that have been banned somewhere . Republicans form censorship committees and read them as a group . <P> " Republicans usually wear hats and always clean their paintbrushes . <P> " Republicans employ exterminators . Democrats step on the bugs . <P> " Republican boys date Democratic girls . They plan to marry Republican girls , but feel they 're entitled to a little fun first . <P> " Republicans sleep in twin beds - some even in separate rooms . That is why there are more Democrats . " <P> Could this attempt to portray Republicans as supersquares be a subtle maneuver to win sympathy ? After all , who would not feel sorry for a candidate sleeping alone with a hat on , in a room reeking of paint cleaner and Raid , denied even the comfort of reading Joy of Sex ?      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
