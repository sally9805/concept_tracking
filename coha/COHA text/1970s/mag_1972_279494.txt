JUST after the 11 p.m. curfew , a convoy of green and white police vans slid into a small alley off Phat Diem Street in Saigon 's Second District . Policemen toting M-16 rifles and wooden clubs jumped out and sealed off the alley at either end . Pushing brusquely into each apartment , they demanded identity cards . Suspected Viet Cong sympathizers , draft dodgers or army deserters were hustled off to a van . <P> Every night in Saigon , some 200 to 300 people are arrested in similar police sweeps , and others are grabbed without warning on the street during the day . Since last spring 's North Vietnamese offensive and especially after the beginning of peace talks , there has been an alarming upswing in arrests . Offenses are as diverse as suspected Communist leanings , or having a relative in the North , or being neutral-which violates an admonition of President Nguyen Van Thieu : " No neutralism in the Communist way . " <P> The fate of Saigon 's political prisoners is one of the most troublesome issues bedeviling the prospects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out by Henry Kissinger and Le Due Tho provides that " all captured and detained personnel will be returned simultaneously with the U.S. troop withdrawal . " But to release the prisoners would present a delicate problem to President Thieu . Most of them are resentful enough to support any leftist opposition and work to bring his government down . <P> <P> Thieu 's purge of suspected enemies has been so massive that even the government may not know how many prisoners it has-or how many of them can be rightly classified as political . Besides 58,000 prisoners of war ( including 11,200 North Vietnamese ) , 80,000 South Vietnamese political prisoners are in jail , according to South Vietnamese sources . U.S. observers estimate that there are perhaps 90,000 people in prison all together , including not only political prisoners but also P.O.W.s and common criminals . <P> They have no recourse to justice . <P> Under martial law , clamped on the country in May , anyone who is considered a threat to national security-a vague charge , to be sure - can be held in " preventive detention " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentences can still be held if they are considered dangerous to security . Opposition Leader Truong Dinh Dzu , who ran against Thieu in 1967 as a peace candidate and was subsequently jailed for advocating a coalition government , was due to be released in May . He is still behind bars , although his quarters are comfortable and his family is allowed to visit him .
