WITH his infinite capacity for surprise , President Nixon last week unfurled Phase III-a new anti-inflation program that goes much further than almost anyone had expected toward giving more economic freedom to managers and workers . Though the change was dramatic , the announcement was carefully low-key . Instead of the presidential TV address that started the wage-price freeze 17 months ago or the flurry of last-minute directives and guidelines that launched Phase II , there was only an executive order , a message to Congress and some press briefings . The shunning of theatrics was appropriate : it reflected a decision by Nixon and his closest advisers that the elaborate controls of Phase II had done their job and that the time had come to move to a looser system . Nixon wanted to act before the controls caused serious distortions in the economy and became widely unpopular , or before the nation became overdependent on them . <P> The President scrapped much of the control mechanisms of Phase II and substituted a kind of honor system in which most companies and unions will be expected to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new liberty , the Government will retain what Treasury Secretary George Shultz called a stick in the closet-the authority to enforce compliance with the guidelines . In essence , Phase III follows the " jawboning with teeth " strategy long championed by Nixon 's Democratic critics . Indeed , it is close to a campaign proposal of George McGovern 's . Its main features : <P> &gt;With few exceptions , even the biggest companies and unions no longer need to get Government approval before raising wages or prices . Initially , at least , they can negotiate any pay raises or post any price boosts they feel justified-though they will still face the possibility of later rollbacks . <P> &gt;Small companies and unions-those with fewer than 1,000 workers-will be entirely exempted from the program . They will not even have to keep wage-price records . All federal rent controls will be abolished . <P> &gt;The Pay Board and the Price Commission will go out of business within 90 days . Enforcement of the program will be taken over by the Cost of Living Council ( COLC ) , which will have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which to try to pare down in negotiation and which simply to order reduced . The COLC will be headed by John T. Dunlop , a tough , politically savvy labor economist and dean of Harvard 's faculty of arts and sciences , who is equally respected in the dissimilar worlds of hardhats and mortarboards . <P> &gt;The COLC will set wage-price guidelines . For the time being , it is keeping them about the same as in Phase II , though it may well change them later . It can investigate increases that seem to go beyond the guidelines , and order them cut down . But the COLC will have only enough staff to focus on egregious violators ; the number of Government employees policing pay-price behavior will be halved to 2,000.
