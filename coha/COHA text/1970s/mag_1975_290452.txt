COONSKIN <P> Directed and Written by RALPH BAKSHI <P> Before it was released , Coonskin was a " controversial " movie . Representatives of CORE who saw it in preview denounced it for trafficking in vicious racial stereotypes , and this anger caused its original distributor , Paramount , to relinquish it gratefully to a smaller , less visible competitor . Once this happened , of course , the film was defended by other black groups charging censorship . They claimed that although Coonskin indeed showed blacks as hookers , hoodlums and con artists , it also showed the principal characters as tough , smart and ultimately victorious over still worse oppressors-mainly , corrupt cops and vile mafiosi . <P> As so often happens when hassles like this break out , people get so busy taking a position that they lose sight of the fact that the object of their contention is not worth the hot air they expend on it . In the case of Coonskin , a slovenly ineptitude of design and execution , not a desire to affront , should be the subject of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a blend of animation and live action . Like Director Bakshi 's previous inexplicable successes , Fritz the Cat and Heavy Traffic , the movie labors under the delusion that outrageousness is a synonym for wit , ugliness of line and color a form of style , crudeness a necessary ingredient of vitality . <P> The ineptly staged live sequences , which add nothing to the film but enough footage to bring it to feature length , deal with an abortive attempt by two black men to spring a colleague from a Southern jail . They frame an animated tale in which three more successful crooks-Rabbit , Bear and Fox-come North and conquer Harlem by wresting control of its rackets from Whitey . <P> If Bakshi had any genuine skill as a satirist or draftsman , these spiritual descendants of the Uncle Remus characters might have become participants in the sort of Swiftian drama he apparently intended . There are hints here and there of a desire to demonstrate that black street styles are not stereotypes at all but put-ons . Such disguises can-sometimes-help individuals to get at least some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know that they are trying . Bakshi 's sensibility is too vulgar for such an exercise . With a newspaper storm breaking around him , he has been reduced to protesting that " I love black people , I love the guys I grew up with " ( in Brooklyn 's Brownsville section in the ' 50s , when it was becoming a black ghetto ) . One is inclined to believe him . No one who does not wear white sheets in public could intentionally offer such a blatantly distasteful representation of blacks on the screen at this late date and hope to get away with it . Irony was surely intended-and sorely missed in the end . Bakshi has been condemned for the wrong reasons , but condemnation of some sort is , alas , richly merited in his case .
