Jimmy Carter 's palace guard is now official : it is mainly Georgian , mainly young and mainly unfamiliar with Washington . When the names were announced , some old hands in the nation 's capital wondered-as is customary with every changeover to a new Administration-if the new White House staff really had the talent and the experience to live up to the job . Certainly the transition has not been smooth , despite Carter 's avowals that it would be the best-planned in history . But the incoming President 's men are bright , dedicated and diligent , and even their critics must admit that they have already pulled off one startling surprise : getting their mentor elected in the first place . <P> Free Access . Carter chose Hamilton Jordan , 32 , his shrewd and affable campaign manager , to be his chief political adviser . Jordan has been a loyalist since 1966 , when Carter was running his losing race for the Georgia governorship . Another key role will be played by Press Secretary Jody Powell , 33 , who began working for Carter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Issues Coordinator Stuart Eizenstat , 34 , a Harvard Law graduate who helped shape the Democratic platform for Carter , will become domestic affairs adviser . Frank Moore , 41 , who irritated many politicians during the campaign by failing to return phone calls , will nonetheless handle congressional relations . Jack Watson , 38 , a former Marine who graduated from Harvard Law School and later helped Carter as governor , will direct relations between the White House and the Cabinet . Campaign Treasurer Robert Lipshutz will take over as White House counsel . A senior partner in a successful Atlanta law firm , Lipshutz has advised Carter for almost ten years and , at 55 , is the grand old man of the staff . <P> Carter had earlier dropped plans to name Greg Schneiders , 29 , as his presidential appointments secretary because of reports that he had improperly collected unemployment benefits while running a Washington restaurant consulting firm . However , Schneiders was cleared last week by U.S. Attorney Earl J. Silbert of any wrongdoing and is expected to get another job . Meantime , Carter named @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kraft impressed his boss by engineering the key victories in the Iowa caucus and the Pennsylvania primary . <P> Carter 's problems , if any , may be less with his people than the way he proposes to use them . Instead of naming a chief of staff and creating a well-defined pecking order , Carter plans to give his top half-dozen assistants free access to the Oval Office . If that proves to be too inefficient , the betting is that Jordan or Lipshutz will emerge as the head man . In his favor , Lipshutz has his years , his avuncular manner and his legal savvy . He will preside over the morning staff meetings . <P> New Breed . Carter plans to cut the size of the present White House staff of 485 by about 30% . Jody Powell , for example , will have nine fewer aides than Ford 's press office . Powell already has a reputation for being disorganized ; yet with a diminished staff , he will be expected to oversee speechwriting as well as the news operation . <P> For all the concern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breed in the White House will conduct a quiet revolution . The emphasis is on the word quiet . " Before we start tearing things apart , " he says , " we 're going to see what really needs to be torn apart . "
