The concrete cooling towers looming eerily in the dusk on this week 's cover belong to the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant complex outside Harrisburg , Pa. , site of the most serious accident in the relatively brief history of nuclear power . TIME dispatched three correspondents and a staff photographer to the stricken area , and their reports and pictures , along with files from our bureaus across the nation , were woven by Senior Writer Ed Magnuson into a story that not only reconstructs the accident in detail , but also assesses its consequences for the future of nuclear power and for U.S. energy policy as a whole . <P> First on the scene from TIME was Peter Stoler , who wrote for the magazine 's Science and Environment sections before he became a New York City-based correspondent in 1977 . Accompanied by Photographer Bill Pierce , Stoler began the assignment with an early-morning high-speed drive on a rainswept turnpike to Harrisburg . For the next three days , Stoler interviewed plant workers , area residents and protesters , and visited the Pennsylvania Governor 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Nuclear Regulatory Commission control van parked on a knoll directly across the Susquehanna River from the plant and a refugee center set up in an amusement park . " I do n't know how much radiation I 've absorbed , " says Stoler , " but I was standing across the river from the plant while , unbeknownst to me , it was emitting radioactive gases into the environment . " <P> For New York Bureau Chief Donald Neff , who arrived a day later with Correspondent John Tompkins , it was a troubling journey . " As a child , " he explains , " I used to spend my summers in Goldsboro , a small town just across the river from Three Mile Island , and I remember roaming the island in search of Indian arrowheads and swimming from its shores . My mother , sister and other relatives still live in the area . For the first time in years , I was gazing at Three Mile again , sensing now more than just its mystery . For the first time the island , with its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been before . "
