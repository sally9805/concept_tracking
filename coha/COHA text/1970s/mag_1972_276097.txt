The exquisite sculpture depicting the ancient Egyptian Queen testifies to the appropriateness of her name : Nefertiti , " The Beautiful One Is Come . " Now University of Pennsylvania Archaeologist Ray Winfield Smith has suggested that she had brains to match her looks . His evidence : carvings on the scattered fragments of a temple erected at Karnak in the 14th century B.C. by the Queen 's husband , Pharaoh Akhenaten . After analyzing photographs of 35,000 pieces of this archaeological jigsaw puzzle , Smith reports that Nefertiti is depicted more often than the Pharaoh-an unheard-of honor for a woman of her time . Akhenaten 's own portraits depict thick lips , feminine hips and thighs , and rudimentary breasts . The King , says Archaeologist Smith , may have suffered from a hormonal malfunction that left him simpleminded and sterile . All of which suggests to Smith that Nefertiti 's six daughters were not sired by her husband , and that she played a large part of the role usually assigned to the sun-worshiping Pharaoh , founder of history 's first monotheistic religion .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
