txt A major congressional move scnea ? uled to be announced ThurSday may result in ending all military aid to Saigon before this calendar year is out . With South Vietnam pulling back from four provinces and possibly five , the sources are convinced that within a few weeks Congress must deal with an urgent Ford administration request for additional military aid to South Vietnam . Yet for two reasons the administration 's leverage is declining while Congress 's is rising , congressional sources insist . ? Despite President Ford 's announced willingness to compromise with Congress and gain three more years of military aid , congressional sources insist he ? missed a major opportunity within the last two weeks because the State Department refused to make significant dollar concessions . No compromise reached Sources say Senators Frank Church and James 13 . Pearson met with high State Department officials March 7 and 11 in an effort to agree on a compromise ; the State Department // *Congress to vote on Saigon aid // sought $6.3 billion in aid spread evenly over three years , whereas the senators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tapering off to nothing in three years . No significant moves toward compromise ensued , sources report ; and the two senators have abandoned their efforts to reach a compromise . Had they been successful , however , it would have guaranteed some continued military and economic aid to South Vietnam at least until July 1 , 1977. o Since Senators Church and Pearson ended negotiations with the State Department a week ago , South Vietnam 's pull-back decision causes many in Congress to think that nation is more vulnerable militarily than they previously had thought . Several sources confirm that now the views of some congressional doves are swinging toward the dominant congressional view of Cambodia , although they are not yet identical ? that pouring additional military money into the nation would be wasting it . The result is to strengthen the hands of Senators Charles McC . Mathias ( R ) of Maryland and Adlai Stevenson III ( D ) of Illinois , who later Thursday are to propose that all military aid to South Vietnam be ended during calendar 1975 . This newspaper has learned that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are : ? With one exception , end all military aid to South Vietnam on June 30 , 1975 . ? That exception ? permit military aid for no more than 120 additional days if the President certifies to Congress that it would be useful in finding a peaceful settlement to the Vietnamese war . This newspaper has received indications from the offices of several moderate and liberal senators not yet willing to be identified that they support the Mathias approach to end all military aid to South Vietnam this year . But they are holding back from announcing this support because politically they do not wish to be " out in front " on the issue . However , some supporters see the Mathias proposal as the starting place for what they expect to be difficult negotiations with the Ford administration . In order to obtain " much more additiOnal nitlitar'y ' aid in South Vietnam , it is widely believed in Congress , the President must agree to a definite cut-off date for such aid . Several in Congress call the Vietnamese situation very fast-moving , as more and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to prevent future military aid from going to Cambodia .
