" You take heaven . I 'd rather go to Bermuda . " Mark Twain TRAVEL THE MERMU NGLE From the air , Bermuda sprawls like a one-clawed lobster in an aquamarine sea , vulnerable to every wind in heaven . Brilliant purple and cerulean waters lap at long white stretches of beach . Inland , the colors continue : lush green hills are flecked with lavender and white houses . At the head and tail of this lobster , perched atop the highest hills like majestic pink bookends , tower the Princess Hotels . They are the tallest , most luxurious testimony to the island 's complete dependence on tourism . The hotels are crowned by terraced limestone roofs  --  as are all the houses in Bermuda  --  to catch and cleanse rain , their only source of fresh water . And that 's the first paradox , obvious even before you land : an island built in homage to sun has shaped itself for rain . " Paging Cecil Christley and Henry Watlington , " crisps an Oxfordian voice over the airport loudspeaker . Two men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call . Bermuda is Great Britain 's oldest colony ( established in 1612 ) , and the English influence permeates every phase of life  --  from taking afternoon tea and driving on the left to sporting a parish crest on one 's blazer . One also does what 's proper by one 's address . Spurning numbers , Bermudians name their houses . Mail comes delivered to " Winkfield , Somerset , " or " Paget Hall , Middle Road . " Inspired by such genteel personalizations , I 've dubbed my estate " Unorthodox Manor . " Yet  --  and here 's another paradox  --  while Bermudians swear allegiance to the Queen , they admit they 're actually more directly influenced by New York . Fully 85% of the population have hopped on American Airlines ' 90-minute flight to New York City to escape the " rock happies . " Only 15% of the natives have ever been to London . There are only two roads the length of this 22-mile-long island , about 11,000 cars and but one traffic light . Crowded roads are a problem , though one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is two miles wide , you 're never more than a mile from the openness of the sea . To prevent worse traffic jams , however , aliens are not permitted to drive ( or rent ) cars . You navigate Bermuda by public bus , by licensed tourist taxis you hire by the hour or day , or you don a helmet and join the " bourgeois Hell 's Angels . " You have n't lived till you 've putt-putted on a motorbike past banyan trees hundreds of years old , their roots splayed like giant octopi ; or zoomed down to a sunny beach sparkling with periwinkles ; or threaded through the botanical gardens bursting with purple passion flowers . I ask about an eerie sound I hear . " That 's the fishmonger at Hamilton Harbour , blowing a conch to announce the catch is in . Could you do with some lunch ? " Whereupon the driver flipped off the meter and drove to Dennis ' Hideaway in St. David 's . It was a tucked-away place with a grab-bag assortment of old kitchen tables and chairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ version of Friar Tuck , and he served up the most delicious fish chowder and rum-laced conch stew I 'd ever tasted . He also gave me a sampling of everything bubbling and crackling on his old black stoves  --  from delicate corn fritters to spicy shark soup to hearty mussel pie . They 're a sensible people , the Bermudians  --  businessmen , fishernen  --  with a historical aversion to farming . Except for fish , carrots , potatoes and those famous onions , all food is imported . On the English side , they 're pointedly punctual and happily formal . Ties and jackets are required after six . No bare chests allowed off the beach . They adhere to sherry before dinner , walks in the garden afterwards ; powdered white wigs and " Hear ! Hear ! " in Parliament ; Pimms and pubs and the kind of reasonable good foresight that prohibits billboards and neon signs from marring the kilometers of royal palms and banana trees . They revere tradition . A summer scorcher is still referred to as a " regular Sairy Bassett " ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stake in 1731 . And like their forebears who shoaled here centuries ago , the islanders still use barometers made of shark-liver oil , which clouds and thickens at the approach of storms . From the African side ( all blacks in Bermuda can trace their lineage to slaves ) come contributions now embraced by the population as a whole . It is n't Christmas without cassava pie . Traditional Sunday breakfast consists of codfish and potatoes liberally doused with hot sherry pepper sauce and fresh thyme . Reggae music and vestiges of folklore persist . One woman told me the spirit of a dying person gives a death pinch to someone it loves as it leaves the body . " But most Bermudian blacks , " says a black man in a high government position , " are unique in their friendliness and their standard of living . Even as slaves my ancestors did n't perform menial tasks , " he says . " They ran English households and the English refinement rubbed off . " " Integration today ? " I ask . " Well , there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " and sometimes it 's ironic . For example , I recently put a new limestone roof on my house . For the price of a case of beer and some bottles of booze , ten friends came over to help . I paid a white mason to direct the ten of us  --  all prominent blacks in high positions . The mason was the conductor and we the orchestra . By choice , we carried the buckets and cement  --  and that , I can tell you , is a case of role reversal . " See that sparkle on my roof ? " he added . " That 's a tradition . Before the roof dries you flip up a 500 piece for perpetual prosperity . " Like everything else , integration was accomplished politely in Bermuda . " I was refused permission to eat a hamburger in a local restaurant in 1956 , " says Chief Inspector Allan Lester . " Now , 21 years later , my kids ca n't believe it . " Lester was recently promoted on the force . Until several years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Theaters were segregated till 1967 , and blacks were not permitted above the laundry rooms of big hotels . " But then there was a sea of black faces down by City Hall , " remembers Lester , " and they realized the foolishness of the situation . It was that simple . Sometimes there 's some confusion about how to refer to us , " he smiled . " You know that newspaper quote : ' A colored policeman arrested a black man in a Negro neighborhood today . ' Well , Alex Haley can dig back to his slave roots if he wants . I 'm more interested in going forward . " Despite recent strides , black citizens of Bermuda still say their biggest problem is the lack of integration . White Bermudians say " lack of space . " In fact , the two problems and their solutions are closely aligned . Fully 56,000 full-time residents live on Bermuda 's 21 square miles . That means this tiny archipelago has a population density triple that of teeming Singapore or Hong Kong . With jobs and houses at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new legislation that directly affects integration . Now , it 's almost impossible for employers to bypass local talent in favor of foreign job-seekers . The law is to protect qualified blacks from being passed over for promotions . Another law guarantees the availability of middle-income housing . An alien ca n't buy a home here valued under $100,000 . " Yet , the British are the exception to this rule , " complains a highly placed black in our group . " They can buy up the choicest spots and still retain their British citizenship . " Yesterday , I saw black school kids crossing the road . I wondered , ' Where can they go ? ' The best jobs and choicest houses are taken by the British . These kids are like prisoners on a sunken ship . If they try to surface , they find they 're trapped under the hull . " The social situation 's pretty good , " he continues , " though until just last year out-of-country guests were given privileges in tennis and yacht clubs that had excluded me , a native @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " there is a behind-the-scenes inte- gration on this island that its architects would never have dreamed of . " Bermuda is a paradise , to be sure . But it is also a microcosm of all the problems attendant in our own country , not the model of integration so glibly propounded elsewhere . But because Bermuda is an island  --  a fragile , tiny , crowded island  --  there is no room for mistakes . Patriotism runs high , and both blacks and whites want what 's best for Bermuda . If any country is apt to solve its problems reasonably and without violence , it 's this little one sprawled in the sea . One day I went to visit Harry Cox , a ruddy , heavyset man of middle age who is a historian of Bermuda . He was wearing Bermuda shorts , a white shirt , a navy tie with white ships , and he greeted me in his front parlor with his drink , his pipe and the accouterments of great wealth around him . His is one of the founding families of Bermuda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ship , The Golden Rule , which augments the beauty of antique mahogany furniture gleaming in the dining room . " My great-great uncle captained The Golden Rule , " he says . " It brought the first boatload of Portuguese here in 1834 . " During the week , Harry Cox is a prosperous grocer . On weekends , he is a gentleman diver and because of this , a local legend . For he has recovered from the opalescent deep " the treasure , " as he expresses it : " jewels and cannon and artifacts that put me , quite literally , in touch with my past . " To understand Bermuda today you must know a bit of its past , for it has no parallel in history , " Cox says . As he speaks , he puffs on his pipe and totally ignores three rambunctious dogs tearing across the Oriental rugs after a cat . " In 1612 , when Bermuda was colonized , it was entirely uninhabited except for hogs whose squeals scared sailors into believing the place was frequented by devils , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who established what is now the oldest self-governing parliament outside of England . " We imported slaves in 1620 and by 1674 had prohibited further importation . So Bermuda 's place in the social history of the Western Hemisphere is a proud one . " By 1834 , slavery was abolished by royal decree throughout the British Empire , and the island was poor . We have no resources , lakes or minerals here . Just the sea . We needed agricultural hands and could n't use our colored as they were closely bound to our homes . So on November 11 , 1834 , my great-great uncle brought over Portuguese farmhands . " The first deep-seated schism happened locally in 1776 , when you had your rebellion , " Cox continued . " The Continental Congress placed an embargo on British vessels , which included those in Bermuda . If we could n't trade with America , we 'd be faced with starvation . The sympathies of Bermudians were divided between empathy with the American cause and loyalty to the Crown . The issue was resolved when Bermuda petitioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supplying America with gunpowder . " Now up until this time , Bermuda had been known as The Codfish Aristocracy . You see , we had nothing to earn our livings from but the sea . So we mined it for salt , traded the salt in Nova Scotia for codfish , traded the codfish for Jamaican rum and sold the rum to America . " This filled our coffers until the steam engine rendered our sailing ships obsolete . What to do ? In 1886 , we embarked on tourism with the construction of the Princess Hamilton Hotel , and in the ' 30s we built the Castle Harbour Golf Club in the grand style of refinement and taste . It remains the best 18-hole course in the world . " But like a swaddling child who catches a very bad disease , Bermuda 's tourism industry was ravaged by two World Wars . They so devastated our local economy that today all major hotel properties are owned by foreigners . But I have great faith in this island . In education , sports , business , as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tennis , our people have lived well . " Indeed , they have . Mark Twain , who used to frequent the island , often said : " You take heaven . I 'd rather go to Bermuda . " It 's a compliment echoed by astronomers and divers the world over . ( Astronomers  --  because the skies are so clear , the stars exceptionally visible for study . ) My favorite place is the Aquarium , where crashing water simulates waves swirling across the coral reefs , where spiny lobsters create a winter forest of legs and feelers . You pick up a " talking wand " on entering the Aquarium , which delivers appropriate messages as you stand before each tank . In the Botanical Gardens , perfect for a picnic , sheikdoms of flowers bear exotic names : Pride of India , Pink Star of the Veldt , Pomegranate . Flamingoes wander past , pausing like pink punctuation , and turquoise chameleons if you lift them obligingly change color to match your clothes . " That , " pointed out Mark Oxenham , a young executive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Loquats taste like acombination plum , peach and apricot . It 's unripe when it 's yellow and ripe when it 's yellow  --  so to understand where a loquat is , " he raised his eyebrows like Groucho Marx , " you must press it . It makes wonderful loquat souffle . " If you 've a day when you can tear yourself away from some of the most beautiful coves and beaches in the world , take a trip to St. George and enjoy the history of Bermuda . You 'll see a full-sized replica of the Deliverance , the ship that was to supply starving Jamestown , Virginia , with food when it washed onto Bermuda . You 'll see stocks , pillories and you can dine in English taverns . On the way back , it 's fun to stop at the Perfume Factory , where thousands of Easter lilies , jasmine and passion flowers are pressed into oils and perfume . It takes one hundred blossoms and six months of aging to make a single ounce . Of Bermuda 's many limestone caves , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cool , patient stalactites , which have been dripping prisms of water for the last million years . Two places where tourists do n't seem to go ( and should ) are Spittal Pond and Nature Reserve ( for solitude ) and the Robin Hood Bar ( for camaraderie ) . At Spittal Pond , look for Match Me If You Can , a prevalent shrub whose every leaf is as distinctively different as a fingerprint . Shopping is fantastic in Bermuda  --  goods from Europe are half the price you 'd pay in the States . Calypso offers colorful batiked sportswear ; Cooper 's sells fine French labels and tartans at ridiculously low prices ; Trimingham 's offers china , perfumes , clothes , plus hot sherry pepper sauce and an incredible confection called " clotted cream toffees .

Deep in Bermudian waters , below the reef , below the fiercely dangerous coast subject to violent storms ( a coast which the Spanish called " Isles of the Devils " ) lie hundreds of shipwrecks . It 's known that these Spanish galleons spilled great holds of gold onto the ocean floor , gold which now lies waiting for discovery . One man who got more out of the ocean than he put in is Teddy Tucker , professional fortune hunter and consultant to the film crews of Jaws and The Deep . In 1955 , Teddy found a treasure trove of Spanish gold and jewelry that made
