txt The Supreme Court ruled 5 to 4 today that communities may close their publicly owned recreational facilities rather than comply with court orders to desegregate them . The dissenters protested that such closings expressed an official policy that " Negroes are unfit to associate with whites , " but the majority held that Jackson , Miss. , acted constitutionally when it closed its swimming pools rather than operate them on an integrated basis ; Because the city closed all pools to whites and blacks alike , its action did not deny Negroes the equal protection of the laws , the Court held , Warning by Black Justice Hugo L. Black , who wrote the majority opinion , went beyond the written decision in his statement from the bench to declare that the ruling was not an invitation to Southern communities to avoid school integration by closing schools . " Any subterfuge used or utilized " to avoid school desegregration " will not be allowed , " he said . He promised that " we will look through " any schemes by which public schools are closed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ majority was composed of Justice Black plus President Nixon 's two nominees , Chief Justice Warren E. Burger and Justice Harry A. Blackmun , and Justices Potter Stewart and John M. Harlan , The dissenters were Justices William J. Brennan Jr. , William 0 . Douglas , Thurgood Marshall and Byron R. White . Five Pools Closed The crux of the , decision , according to Justice Black , was that when the Federal courts ordered Jackson to integrate its four white pools and one Negro pool in 1963 the city ceased operation of all five . The reasons given by the Mayor were that the mixing of whites and blacks at pools might touch off violence and the pools would operate at a loss . Justice Black said that although . racial prejudice might have been the motive for closing the pools the Court could not overturn such an action unless the effect was discriminatory . This action was not , he said , because both whites and blacks were left without public pools . Chief Justice Burger added in a concurring statement that to hold that a public facility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " would plainly dis // courage the expansion and enlargement of needed services in the long run . " In another concurring state- ' ment , Justice Blackman stressed that schools were not involved , that pools were not essential public facilities and that a contrary decision could require Jackson to operate the pools at a deficit for years . He concluded that " this is neither the time nor the occasion to be punitive toward Jackson for her past constitutional sins of segregation . " Justice White asserted in a dissent that the act of closing the pools to avoid integration was discriminatory ' ' state action , " forbidden by the 14th Amendment . The effect , he said , may be to discourage blacks in the South from bringing desegregation suits , since the outcome may be that they will lose their present segregated facilities . Justice Marshall , the only Negro on the Court , added in a brief dissent that the effect of the decision was to " turn the clock back 17 years " to the days before the Supreme Court declared unconstitutional the separate-but-equal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separate dissent , Justice Douglas argued that equal access to public facilities was a right protected by the Ninth Amendment , which says that the enumeration of constitutional rights does not " deny or disparage " other rights " retained by the people . " Therefore , he said , no level of government may discontinue any of its municipal services for racial reasons . The ruling Is expected to have little practical impact , as few communities have closed recreational facilities , despite the fact that the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit , which has jurisdiction over the Deep South , held in this case that the pools could be closed . Four other Mississippi towns are known to have closed their Pools , In Montgomery , Ala. , the city parks were temporarily ' closed but have been reopened , with no animals in the zoo and no water in the swimming pool . Today 's decision may have a more significant symbolic importance in underscoring recent reluctance by the Supreme Court to extend civil rights concepts . The Justice Department joined today 's case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who challenged the pool closings . Paul A. Rosen of Detroit and William M. Xunstler of New York argued for the blacks . William F. Goodman Jr . of Jackson argued for the city . Justice Marshall was absent ' from the bench today , as he rested at home after undergoing several days of tests at Bethesda Naval Hospital . The results of the tests arc not yet known . The Court is now expected to end its present term June 28 . In another action today the , Court ruled unanimously that states could not deny welfare benefits to needy persons solely because they were aliens . The decision overturned laws in Pennsylvania and Arizona and will presumably have the effect of invalidating similar statutes in Colorado , Florida , Indiana , New Hampshire , North Dakota , South Carolina , Texas and Oklahoma . The Court held that such laws denied aliens the equal protection of the laws and also encroached upon Congress 's exclusive authority to determine the status of aliens .                @ @ @ @ @
