Austerity over Potency <P> Sir / On your article " The Big Car : End of the Affair " Dec. 31 , I find it distressing , sick , and almost unimaginable that there is little that can replace the gluttonous oversized cars as a part of the American dream . For a Christian nation , we sure are hung up on the tangibles anyway . <P> A small car feels like the automotive extension of oneself , while an American V-8 is so dwarfing that I feel like it is driving me . Finally ( perhaps best of all ) , people compliment me on my genuine austerity rather than my feigned " potency . " <P> PAUL TRUSTEN Woburn , Mass . <P> Sir / It seems to me totally unthinking for a person to drive a power-steered - braked and - shifted , heavily insured ( does its owner insure his own life so well ? ) , overstuffed , $5,000 or more investment to the corner store or even 35 miles to work when something half the size and cost will do the job , polluting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> It sure would be nice to see Detroit get into a " more mileage from less horsepower " advertising campaign and thus act positively in a situation they are partially responsible for creating with 50 years of " more powerful and bigger is better " advertising . <P> DON WOOLF Los Angeles <P> Sir / The big cars are the dinosaurs of the future-and the future is now ! <P> VIRGINIA E. SNYDER San Diego <P> Sir / As if there were n't enough to be bothered with these days , now the owners of small cars are persecuting the owners of larger cars because we are taking all of their gas . As for myself , I 'd rather take my chances of survival in a larger car than a compact , especially on the New Jersey Turnpike . And it does seem strange that there are full oil tankers cruising up and down the Delaware River with no place to deposit their cargo . <P> MARK A. JOHNSON Voorhees , N.J. <P> Sir / You are correct that the Governor of Delaware has opted for a smaller vehicle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chevrolet hardtop on state business , rather than the state-owned limousine . Your reference , nevertheless , was to the wrong Governor . Russell W. Peterson is the former Delaware Governor who traded in his limousine for a Ford Pinto in his new role as head of the Council on Environmental Quality in Washington . D.C. <P> IRENE E. SHADOAN Press Secretary to the Governor Dover . Del . <P> Corruption of the Best <P> Sir / Thomas Griffith 's Essay , " Corruption in the U.S. " Dec. 31 , brings to mind a Latin phrase that seems to explain why many of us are uptight about the recent White House pursuits : Corruptio optimi pessima - the corruption of the best is the worst of all . <P> MERLIN W. HUGHES Gassville . Ark . <P> Sir / Like the movie stars they so often seem to emulate , American politicians have lost texture , abandoning the tough philosophical basis on which the nation was founded . Politics no longer confronts , never mind answers , the ethical and philosophical demands that the earliest political theorists thought important . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by men who are constantly assaulted by crises that ( as our current situation shows ) can not be adequately settled with a day-to-day , moment-to-moment ethos based on opinion polls and soft , ultimately perishable concerns .
