txt Talks to limit strategic nuclear weapons are back on the track because both Washington and Moscow have made concessions on their own key weapons ? the low-flying , long-range U.S. cruise missile , and the Soviet Backfire bomber ? it is believed here . Arms-control specialists here say they think that the cruise missile , now on American drawing boards , would be limited from its potential range of 2,000 miles to 700 miles . The Backfire bomber would be deprived of its ability to refuel in flight and would be allowed at a fewer number of Soviet bases . These concessions , the specialists say , are the reasons why Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger can fly to Moscow next week for strategic arms talks with Soviet party chief Leonid 1 . Brezhnev . Dr. Kissinger says he also will discuss Angola with Mr. Brezhnev ? and used a press conference Wednesday ( Jan. 14 ) to issue // *U.S. , Soviets find opening in arms impasse // another warning of the danger of Soviet intervention to detente . Concessions on the cruise and Backfire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dispatch from Moscow , would , in effect , reduce the cruise from a fully strategic weapon to one that could only be used to break through Soviet air defenses . They also would mean that the Backfire could be used to attack targets in the U.S. only if the crew acted as a one-way " kamikaze " unit . The cruise presumably still would retain the flexibility to be launched from either aircraft or submarine . Dr. Kissinger would not discuss the nature of the concessions at his press conference , merely saying that he would fly to Moscow on the basis of " substantial modifications " in the Soviet position . The thrust of Dr. Kissinger 's news conference was to warn the Soviet Union that if it did not withdraw its support of a faction in Angola and Cuban troops , U.S. relations with Soviet Union would deteriorate and " even the SALT strategic arms agreement might be affected . " He drew a grim picture of what an unlimited arms race between the two countries would mean should SALT break down and in the limitations of strategic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Vladivostock conference in late 1974 . If the Russians do n't leave Angola it " can lead to very serious consequences , " he said . He would be willing to agree with the Soviet Union on a plan for phased withdrawal of outside forces from Angola in which the South Africans would take the lead " of course on the assumption that the lapse of time between their departure and that of the Cubans would not be so long that the Cubans would have the opportunity in the meantime to occupy the whole of the country . " According to his information there are very few MPLA ( pro-Marxist ) African troops in the line opposing the FNLA and UNITA . " Most of the fighting for the MPLA is being done by Cubans " he said . Presumably anticipating that an agreement with the Russians limiting the range of cruise missiles would bring denunciations from critics such as former Secretary of Defense James R. Schlesinger and former Chief of Naval Operations Elmo Zumwalt , the Secretary appealed to Americans and to the Congress to maintain unity in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign relations can not be conducted without " some sort of authority . " He pointed out that an arms-control agreement would be reached not merely to please one side or the other but because it would be in the " mutual interest and in the interest of the world . " The Secretary of State said that two National Security Council meetings had been held and another was planned before he was to leave for Moscow and that all parties concerned , including the joint chiefs of staff , were agreed on the policy he would pursue .
