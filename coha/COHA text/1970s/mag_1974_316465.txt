The tap on the shoulder may be fleeting , the brush across the cheek gone sooner than it is felt , but the momentary effect is unmistakable : an unwilling suspension of belief in the rational . An old friend suddenly remembered , and as suddenly the telephone rings and the friend is on the line . A vivid dream that becomes the morning reality .

The picture miraculously shows the " aura " or outline of the whole leaf . <P> &gt; In Washington , the Defense Department 's Advanced Research Projects Agency assigns a team to investigate seemingly authentic psychic phenomena at the Stanford Research Institute . <P> &gt; On both sides of the Atlantic , Uri Geller , a young Israeli psychic , astounds laymen and scientists alike by bending spoons and keys apparently with the force of his thoughts . <P> &gt; In the Philippines , Tennis Star Tony Roche is relieved of painful " tennis elbow " when an incision is made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a psychic healer , who knows nothing of surgery or of modern sanitation . <P> &gt; In the U.S. , the number of colleges offering courses in parapsychology increases to more than 100.
