txt Fighting in Cambodia has slowed down over the past few days but military analysts expect it to pick up again fairly soon . Veteran analysts say that despite 43 consecutive days of American bombing in Cambodia , the current Khmer Rouge offensive against Phnom Penh government forces could last several more weeks . They expect a truly significant dropoff in fighting to occur only after heavy rainfall hits Cambodia in late May or early June . Then the area around Phnom Penh will become flooded , and the city will be less vulnerable to infiltration and attacks . These analysts do not expect a major assault aimed at taking the capital . But they fully expect rocket attacks against specific targets in and around the city as well as against its nearby airfield . They also expect raids by highly trained commandos such as have occurred in the past against selected targets in the Phnom Penh area . Such attacks might even occur inside the city proper , analysts say . There is little doubt that the insurgents have , forces available for some kind of attacks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bombers against their suspected positions cause windows in Phnom Penh to rattle violently . There is a great deal of debate in Phnom Penh as to the actual military usefulness of American bombing . Some analysts say that bombing probably has prevented at least one Cambodian provincial capital from being overrun . But the North Vietnamese apparently have pumped in sufficient supplies to keep the current offensive going at a high level regardless of any damage the bombing has done to their supply system . Resistance encountered This offensive , which has been the most intensive and lengthy of the war in Cambodia , - seems aimed at the morale of the Phnom Penh government and its supporters as much as anything else . Politically , there are indications that the pressure is beginning to tell . // *Cambodia calm but fresh attacks awaited // President Lon Nol 's effort to reorganize his government , bringing in opposition party leaders to broaden his support , is meeting resistance . In addition to replacing his Cabinet , the reorganization was to include the establishment of a new All-Party State Council with 11 seats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who include several fa- miliar and well-established political personalities . Its purpose would be " to strengthen national unity " by sharing power , according to a government radio announcement . But as of this writing , only six of the Council seats have been filled ? all by Lon Nol men . Opposition leaders appear wary of being drawn into the government under present conditions . There are reports of " intensive bargaining " The two men most needed to give the reorganization at least a show of success are Lt. Gen. Sisowath Sirik Matak , leader of the Republican Party , and popular liberal politician In Tam , who ran second in last year 's presidential election . General Sirik Matak in particular has the respect of American officials , here , who feel his administrative ability is needed to strengthen the Phnom Penh government . If neither he nor In Tam accept the invitation to join the new council , for whatever reasons , it will be a serious blow to American efforts to prop up the Lon Nol government into a respectable cease-fire bargaining position . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Phnom Penh by U.S. presidential envoy Gen.
