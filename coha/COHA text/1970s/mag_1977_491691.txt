// 11 t is April . The ground has thawed in the Midwest , and the sprawling farmlands are ready to be plowed and planted with wheat and soybeans and corn and tomatoes . This will all he done by machines , as will the spraying and harvesting in the fall . The ground is also ready for tomatoes and cucumbers and beans  --  all the fruits and vegetables that stock the shelves and fill the pantries of our homes . With these products , however , we have a very different story . They are not cultivated as easily . They require intensive methods and many man-hours of hand-labor . The strong chemical herbicides that protect the neighboring grains from weeds and brambles would make them unfit to eat , so their competitors must be cleared away with hoes . Because of the soil and climatic conditions in the Midwest , the harvesting must also be done largely by hand . Thus in April , when the earth is ready , thousands of men and women and children from the Rio Grande Valley of Texas must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possessions , crowd into trucks and vans and cars , and make their yearly journey to migrant labor camps . These workers are Mexican-Americans . However , a large portion of the families have ' been in the Valley area of Texas for so many generations that they know of no ancestor  --  neither parent nor grandparent nor great-grandparent  --  who came from Mexico . In fact , many have probably been in the Valley since the days of the Conquistadors . Although most are bilingual , they speak Spanish in their homes almost exclusively , and their English is accented with the musical tones of the Spanish tongue . They have dark skin and hair and eyes , and their features still bear traces of an Indian heritage . Their communities in the Valley blend into one another as they stretch across the sparse Texas landscape , separated only by long groves of orange and grapefruit trees and fields of cabbages , onions and carrots . The life of migrants in Texas is focused on the winter harvest of these crops  --  picking , transporting and packaging them in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of April , however , they have finished these tasks and are ready for their journey to the North . It is indeed a fortunate trip from Texas that is uneventful . Often the trucks and cars that carry the migrant families are old and unreliable , and there are breakdowns , accidents , illness and fatigue along the way . Sometimes local residents in areas through which migrants must pass are unfriendly or even hostile , and they occasionally harass the alien-looking migrants . Migrant labor is generally contracted through a " crew leader , " who is himself a Mexican-American . He is responsible for transporting the workers to the Midwest , advancing them money for food and other necessities , and supervising their labor in the fields . The crew leader 's duties go far beyond this , however . From April to October , he assumes a patriarchal role among the workers , handling the many day-to-day problems that are bound to arise in this kind of life . When there is car trouble , financial trouble , illness , births and deaths and personal conflicts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And the kind of help that a crew leader will give is as diverse as human nature itself . Many crew leaders are held in esteem by their workers for their fairness and kind treatment . Others are felt to be unfair and exploitative . Some migrants do not contract through a crew leader . They come to the Midwest on their own , led by word of mouth about areas where farmers might be hiring laborers for the summer . Often their information is faulty , and it may take many miles and many stops before they find a farmer who will take them on . Unlike the migrants who contract through a crew leader , these workers usually do not divide their time between the Midwestern camps and homes in Texas . Rather they are on a perpetual cycle of migration which takes them from tomatoes in the early spring in Alabama , to cucumbers in the midsummer in Indiana , to apples in the early fall in Wisconsin , and then down South again to citrus in the winter . Their life is the hardest of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the chance to go to school , and there is no crew leader to finance their trip or to help them in a crisis . But they manage somehow , and there is seldom a complaint of vagrancy against a migrant worker in a farming community . The feelings of the farming community toward these migrants are well expressed in a story by Gene Murphy , a tomato farmer in central Indiana who has been employing migrant labor on a seasonal basis for the past eight years . During this time , he has had many experiences with // stranded workers . One incident in particular stands out in his mind . One evening when he and his family were having their evening meal , a Mexican-American woman knocked at his door . She was alone and weary-looking , and she wanted to know if there was any work for her on his farm . Murphy 's crew was full , however , and he needed no other hands . Since he had no job for her , she said she would like to go on to Michigan to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have the money to get there . So Murphy lent her $25 for the trip . After she had gone , he said he thought to himself : " Goodness , I did n't even get her name , and there 's no telling where she 'll end up . That 's probably the last I 'll ever see of that $25 . " The summer passed , and late one evening toward the end of September there was again a knock at Mr. Murphy 's door . When he answered it , he found the same woman , now on her way back South at the end of the cherry season . She had come many miles out of her way to repay his loan . Murphy says that in eight years he has lent literally thousands of dollars to migrant workers , and he has yet to lose the first dollar . This story is not uncommon among Midwestern farmers . When the migrants finally reach a destination where they can secure work , they settle into camps . These usually consist of clusters of small cabins or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these units . The location of migrant housing on a farm depends on the personal inclinations of the individual farmers . Some want the camp far removed from their own farmhouse ; others want it nearby so they can " keep an eye on things . " The migrant dwellings typically have electricity and one or two gas burners on which the women cook their flour tortillas in flat skillets . There is usually a refrigerator , but no oven which to bake and no running water inside ior washing . Spigots stand outside each cabin , and toilets and washrooms are located in some central spot in the camp . In the larger camps , which may accommodate several hundred people , there may be flush toilets . The smaller camps usually have outdoor privies . The migrants pay no rent outright for this housing , and they look on it as free ; but farmers are allowed to deduct the cost from the workers ' pay . So a worker may receive less than the minimum hourly agricultural wage by an amount equivalent to this rent . Most states @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camps , with regular inspections of the facilities . The independent-minded Midwestern farmer frequently considers these regulations pure harassment by the government . However , as a result of these health codes , conditions in migrant camps today are greatly improved over what they were a decade ago . Nevertheless , there are still some parts of the codes which are abused . For example , the regu- I J I lations typically require farmers to provide around 25 square feet of Living space per occupant in each migrant dwelling , as well as separate sleeping quarters for husband and wife with children past infancy . But there is a high state of flux of the population in migrant camps , and it is virtually impossible for state inspectors to know how many people are living in a migrant cabin at any one time , or what their sleeping arrangements are . Therefore this is probably the most widely violated regulation in the state codes . Migrants typically have large families , and it is not unusual to find four or five people living in one small room and a child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its parents . The thought of living so close probably makes the average American family shudder , but the migrants do not complain about it . There is a spirit of closeness about their families as well as a physical closeness . Despite the best efforts of everybody  --  farmer , farm wife , migrants and other employees  --  migrant camps almost always look run-down . This is inevitable with the steady inflow and outflow of people they must accommodate . Some farmers criticize the migrants ' upkeep of their camp . " They just do n't know how to live like us , " complained one farmer . " Why , I put new screen doors up on their cabins every year , and they just poke holes in them to let more air in . " In fact , the poor appearance of the camps is probably due to a lack of supervision of migrant children . There are few day-care centers in these areas , and with the mother and father and older children working in the fields , the care of the smaller children is usually haphazard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they can not be watched every minute . So as is the case with unattended children everywhere , the end result is dirty woodwork , crayon on the walls , and holes punched in screen doors . During the first weeks in the camps , the work is intermittent . Spring and early summer in the Midwest are very rainy , and when the fields are wet , they can not be worked . When there is no work , there is no pay . And so the migrants may pass several weeks this way  --  waiting in their cabins and watching for the clouds to break . It is during this period that one will see the listless expression of hunger on many faces in the camps . To the migrant , the unreliability of the work is the most serious problem connected with his job . When the weather brightens , so do the spirits in the camps . Everyone will be up at daybreak and out in the fields . During the growing season , the main work of the migrants is weeding . They get paid by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from around $2.20 to $2.50 an hour . The migrants begin the day by forming a long line along one end of a field of tomato or cucumber plants . Each worker will take one row of the crop , and the whole crew will move across the field together , hoeing the weeds that threaten to strangle the newly sprouted plants . The crew leader supervises the work , and his helpers move back and forth among the workers dispensing water from large containers . Some workers drink from the common cup . Others bring their own vessels to the fields with them . The Midwestern sun is hot , and there will be much toil and sweat and grime before the day is over . At the end of the rows the workers may rest for a few moments before making the return trip across the field . As they work , they try to keep pace so they can enjoy each other 's company . if a worker finds himself lagging behind , he will make an extra effort to catch up with the others . Sometimes a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is always a feeling of shared burden among the migrants . When they are able , both old and young alike will work . Thus one finds young teenagers who are just beginning their first season in the fields , and great-grandparents who are beginning their sixtieth . However , most of the workers one encounters are fairly young . This is largely because of the exhausting nature of the labor . It is difficult work to pursue beyond a certain age , and the life expectancy of migrants in general is low . So many of the older people in the camps are not active in the fields . They are there because they are part of the family , and it would be unthinkable to leave them behind . Besides advanced age , the only thing that will keep a migrant from work is disability ; and sometimes even this will not do it . One sees retarded people in the fields  --  the blind , the lame . They are there out of a feeling of self-respect as well as necessity . One blind migrant with two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could get welfare , " he said , " but as long as I am able to hold a job and support my family I want to work . And anyway , I would feel bad if I took welfare , because I might be taking it away from someone else who really needs it . " The first thing the workers do when they get home in the evening is head for the shower rooms to wash away the dirt that clings to their bodies . After a supper of tamales or beans and the completion of household duties , a feeling of tired conContinued on page 100 Migrants continued from page 44 tentment settles over the camp . It is a time of enjoyment  --  enjoyment of the rest , of family , and of the sense of community that pervades the camp . Social interaction in migrant camps is reminiscent of an earlier era in small town America . The adults sit together on wooden benches in front of their cabins and talk of the news of the day , of the prospects for the crop and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likelihood of rain . The children play with endless energy in the dust of the dirt road which winds through the camp . Teenage girls giggle and hide as teenage boys from a neighboring migrant camp come through to visit friends . There are few television sets in the camp , so viewing is not the consuming pastime that it is in so many American homes . On some evenings , priests from nearby Catholic churches come into the camp to hold mass , or baptize babies , or see to other church duties for the devoutly religious migrants . If someone needs help with a chore , a dozen hands are ready ; if a child falls down and cries , not one mother rushes to comfort it , but many ; a birth in the camp is a source of joy to all . People are constantly coming in and out of each other 's cabins . There are no formalities . The few workers who do keep to themselves are not treated with suspicion . The other migrants respect their right to live as they wish . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and are ready for harvesting . A second wave of migrants arrives when the picking begins . The camp becomes crowded and bustles with activity . The crew leader has his hands full making arrangements to accommodate all the workers who will be needed . It is an exciting time in the camps , but also a hard time . It is a time when everyone  --  man , woman and child  --  must shoulder his responsibility for the survival of his family . Children seven and eight years old will go to the fields to pick . They do not hoe and weed in the early season because they are not up to that work . But even a very young child can pick cucumbers and tomatoes , and the family will receive about 200 for every large hamper of these products it can present to the crew leader . The parents are not happy about their children having to work , but they have no choice . For many , this is the only money they will make all year , and they must earn enough to live through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influx of illegal Mexicans into the Valley area of Texas makes it difficult for many of the migrants to get jobs when they return , and they are not covered by unemployment compensation . In fact , migrants with large families may actually quit the winter jobs they hold in Texas to join the stream , because they need to have more members of their families working and earning money . Most states have laws against agricultural child labor , but they are difficult to enforce . There are notenough officials to check all the fields at all times , and even when they do make inspections it is easy enough for a child to slip out of the field and return when the inspector has gone . The farmers police this as well as they can because a reported violation means a stiff fine . But they too can not be watching every minute ; and in the end , they generally throw up their hands at the situation . " After all , " said one frustrated farm manager , " you just ca n't tell a parent what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the children work . At the beginning of the season when the influx of migrants has just begun in these Midwestern communities , and the " migrant issue " is fresh on everybody 's mind , there is perhaps a stronger effort to prevent this child labor ; but by harvesttime , when theseason is drawing to an end , it becomes pretty much a moot question in the minds of most local citizens . Indeed the attitudes toward migrants in general are mixed in the local communities . Many of the townspeople are suspicious of these " strange-looking , strange-speaking " people who come into their midst , and they look down on them . In one camp , youths from the town harassed the migrants by rattling cabin windows late at night and making tracks in the ground like those of a large two-legged creature . It was difficult to convince the migrants who were unfamiliar with the area that monstrous bears do not roam the American corn belt , and many left the camp . Other unfortunate incidents occur which are insulting and degrading to the migrants . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a local divorcee in her early forties who had gotten a job working in the fields for the summer . The family of the local woman did not approve of her association with migrants ; and one night when the two friends were passing a pleasant evening in the camp chatting together , the mother , brother and grown son of the local woman drove up to take her away . When the woman refused to leave , her family created a scene with loud words about her " undesirable " associations . They walked over to the crew leader 's cabin , but he was not in . They then assailed the mother of the crew leader , Mrs. Gomez , and demanded to know who had bought the woman the can of beer that she was drinking . " Nobody bought it for her , " Mrs. Gomez replied . " She 's old enough to buy it herself . " " Well , she never drank before she got mixed up with you people , " the woman 's mother retorted angrily . Mrs. Gomez looked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get reinforcements to help them force the woman from the camp . When they had gone , Mrs. Gomez expressed her sympathy for the woman . " You know , her family does n't understand , " Mrs. Gomez said philosophically . " It is hard for a woman like her . She is n't old  --  and yet she really is n't young . She 's lonely , and she 's found a friend . " " I feel sorry for her mother , " Mrs. Gomez continued . " She knows in her heart that her daughter has been drinking for a long time , but she wo n't admit it to herself up here , " Mrs. Gomez pointed her finger to her head . " And now , she will go back to town and tell people ' how bad those migrants are . ' " lems and headaches which exist for the farmers in maintaining a camp of migrant workers , they too are affected by the parting , as are their families and their other employees . One farmer spoke of the situation as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devil of a nuisance , " he said . " You never know whether you 're going to have enough hands to do all the work that needs to be done . Then once the migrants get here , the government and the ' do-gooders ' just wo n't leave you alone . Sometimes I think I 'd like to get out of this business  --  except that I would hate to take the work away from the people . Oh , I hate to see them come all right , " he continued , pausing , " but when it 's all over , I hate to see them go . " Many townspeople do indeed have this opinion of migrants , but they are generally the ones who have little or no contact with them . Local officials , police authorities , clergy , and above all , farmers in these communities attest that problems which are not found in migrant camps are crime , delinquency , illegitimacy or drunkenness . They may complain of the migrants ' foreign customs and their difficulty with English , that their housekeeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they have too many children  --  but never that they lack integrity , or are dishonest , rowdy or lazy . As the season wears on , literally millions of baskets of fruits and vegetables are picked . The trucks of the crew leaders are busy from early dawn till sunset hauling these cargoes from the fields to the canneries . One field after another is cleared and left behind . The days grow shorter and cooler , and the migrants know that it is only a matter of time before the first frost will put an end to their labor in the fields and their life in the camp . The ca bins have no heat , and the migrants , unused to cold weather , bundle up like Arctic dwellers . School has started in Texas , and the older children are fretful because they are absent . So some families pack and leave before the season is over . With each departure , there is a sense of loss . The camp is melancholy now . The migrants know their community is breaking up , and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The crop must be completely picked before a freeze , and he watches the labor closely . All breathe a sigh of relief when the final truck leaves for the cannery . The camp is abandoned as quickly as it was occupied . The migrants have few possessions , so packing is a fairly simple task . The partings are sad , but there are always comforting words about " next year . " Despite the many prob-
