txt By a vote of 30 to 27 the Senate gave final legislative approval to a bill repealing New York 's twoyear-old liberalized abortion law and reinstating the old statute permitting abortions only to save the life of the woman . The bill , which was passed by the Assembly late yesterday , now goes to Governor Rockefeller . He has said repeatedly that he will veto it . A spokesman for the Governor reaffirmed after the vote today that lie would veto the bill , in effect leaving the current law still in force and almost assuring that the debate would continue at the next session of the Legislature . In other actions here , the Assembly approved and sent to the Senate a bill that would permit the City University to acquire the Bronx campus of New York University and to authorize the merger of the N.Y.U. Engineering School with the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn , Clocks Are Stopped The Assembly recessed for the evening shortly after 7:30 , and , the Senate soon after a supper break . Clocks in both chambers had been stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many major items still to be considered . The New York State Catholic Committee , which speaks for Roman Catholic dioceses , across the state , Urged the Governor not to act hastily on the abortion bill . Bishop Edwin B. Broderick of Albany , chairman of the committee , urged that " executive action on the bill " be taken " only after a time of mature study during which the general public in the state may add their voices to the issue . " Cardinal Cooke , Archbishop of New York , also called on the Governor , not to veto the bill and urged him " to recognize the will of the majority ot our elected representatives , just as he recognized the will of a bare majority two years ago . " The vote on the highly controversial issue came after more than seven hours of de // bate , the longest thus far this , session . An amendment offered by Senator Murray Schwartz , Queens Democrat , to place the entire issue of abortion before the voters in a November referendum was ruled not germane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Goldin , Bronx Democrat , who voted against repeal ; said the issue was political in part and that enactment of the repeal measure would be carefully scrutinized by " women , the young voter , the alert young man , the older people  --  you will be hearing from them , " In closing the debate , the minority leader , Joseph Zaretzki , said that since the Governor had ' said he would veto the bill , proponents of repeal should instead support a bill modifying the current law to permit elective abortions until the 18th week of pregnancy . " Do the practical thing , " Mr. Zaretzki urged . Enactment of the repeal measure , in light of the Governor 's stand , would be " a vain act , as you well know , " he declared , The Senate majority leader , Earl W. Brydges , Republican of Niagara Falls , an opponent of ' the liberalized law , said " it is extremely difficult for me to speak on the subject . " Mr. Brydges , who is retiring from politics , said he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on in the hospitals and clinics . " " With every fiber of my being , " he said , his voice breaking , " I cry out against the con- , tinuation of this statute on the ) books of the State of New York . Speaking of unborn infants , he said : " If ever a group needed a special pleader , if ever a group needed a special guardian , it 's this group , which obviously can not speak for itself . " Mr. Brydges said afterwards that the bill proposed by the Governor reducing to IS weeks the period during which an abortion would be permitted would not be brought to the floor during this session . ' Only one Senator , Paul P. E. Bookson , Manhattan Democrat , switched his ' vote from 1970 . Mr. Bookson , whose district was carved up by reapportionment which gave him a part of Brooklyn where he is relatively unknown , had voted for Ithe liberalizing law in 1970 ; but today he voted for the repealer . Justification Cited The bill states that " an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a , duly licensed physician acting ' under a reasonable belief that such is necessary to preserve the life of such female . ' ' The bill also calls an abortion justifiable if a woman performs the act upon'herself " upon the advice of a duly licensed physician that such is necessary to preserve her life " or if she believes that a person performing the abortion is a duly licensed physician . During more than seven hours of often-emotional debate , proponents of repeal decried abortion as " murder " and " the deliberate killings of a human being . " Senator Jamses H. Donovan , ' Republican of Chadwicks who was the principal sponsor of the repeal bill , called abortions the " barbaric slaughter of innocents . " He said the more than 350,000 abortions performed in New York City alone meant that " we are exterminating one , human life every three minutes , round the clock , ' . " ' New York 's , newest and most profitable business must be put out of existence in this state , " he said . " Abortion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Jiving , unborn infant . " During his . speech , ? Senator Donovan held up pictures of aborted fetuses and then , had packets of the photographs bearing the notation " what the unborn would like every legislator to know " placed on each Senator 's desk . " This is lobbying . during debate , " shouted Senator Joseph L. Galiber , ' Bronx Democrat , " Who authorized these , pictures to be distributed ? " After ruffled feelings were soothed , the debate ; which had begun shortly before noon , continued well into the early eve : , ning . A Scientific Point Advocates of the present law , which permits abortion on demand up to the ' 24th week of pregnancy , . argued that there was no way of determining scientifically at what point a fetus could be considered a human being , , " This is not a human being , " said Senator Roy M. Goodman , Manhattan republican . " It is a series of organisms which may eventually become a human being . " Mortality Rates Cited Senator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maternal ' mortality rates had dropped sharply during the two years it has been in effect .. " This has sharply etched the fact that , the 1970 law was a life-giving law , " he declared . Opponents of repeal said that the Roman Catholic Church had organized a skillful , hard-hitting campaign to win repeal of , the law . Senator Manfred Ohrenstein , Manhattan Democrat , said he deplored the intrusion of religious beliefs into the issue . ? " You have no right to come to the floor of this body and ask us to enact into law church doctrine , " Senator Ohrenstein said . " The church is seeking a confrontation here . " Early in the debate Senator Emanuel R. Gold , Queens Democrat , had the Senate pages distribute wire coat-hangers to the other Senators . Coat-hangers are often used in illegal abortions to scratch the internal wall of the uterus and cause the pregnancy to be terminated .
