When Mariner 9 arrived in the neighborhood of Mars last November , its TV cameras were thwarted by the billowing yellow dust clouds of a gigantic storm that obscured most of the surface of the Red Planet . Frustrated scientists and controllers at Pasadena 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory began to despair that their spacecraft would ever fulfill its primary mission : mapping the surface of Mars . But by mid-January the Martian skies had cleared , and Mariner began sending back detailed pictures . Last week NASA released the latest group of Mariner photographs . Transmitted across more than 100 million miles of space and clarified with the aid of a computer , they provided spectacular evidence that Mariner 's mission has been a stunning success . <P> The photograph that has caused the most excitement among scientists shows a 250-mile-long valley that resembles an arroyo ( a water-cut gulley common in semiarid regions on earth ) . The valley is 3 miles wide and has branching , streamlike tributaries that seem more likely to have been formed by water than by lava . " We are hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these features , " says Harold Masursky of the U.S. Geolog ical Survey . Although scientists agree that there is no free-flowing water on the Martian surface now , the sharp and uneroded features of the valley indicate that it could have been formed in the not-too-distant past-perhaps within the last million years . <P> Discovery of the valley has increased speculation that water-dependent forms of life may once have existed-or still exist-on Mars . That possibility has also been strengthened by readings from Mariner 's instruments . They indicate that about 100,000 gallons of water vapor escape daily into space from the Martian atmosphere . Scientists believe that the vapor and carbon dioxide are being continually vented from volcanoes in the same kind of process that created the earth 's early atmosphere . <P> Another remarkable group of photos looks straight down at the largest volcano ever seen by man , Nix Olympica , which is six miles high and more than 300 miles in diameter at its base . Evidence of the fury of Martian winds can be seen in a number of pictures that show tear-shaped features to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scientists believe that these features are wind shadows of sand that are formed behind the craters by the violent winds . One photograph shows an area with unusual swirls , and a crater-like feature that to the hard-working JPL scientists seems to have definite feminine characteristics . The area has been named " Lascivious Lacus. "
