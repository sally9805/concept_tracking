txt Jimmy Carter , confronted by a sagging economy and demands for new spending , faces a budget dilemma even before he becomes president on Jan. 20 . With no new programs , warns the outgoing Ford administration , federal spending in fiscal 1978 ? the budget now under consideration ? will rise at least $35 billion , producing a deficit ranging from $32 billion to $56 billion . Why ? Because outlays for some programs , such as social security , are tied to inflation , while increased spending for other programs is mandated by existing law . A $35 billion increase , notes the White House Office of Management and Budget ( OMB ) , is " optimistic , " based on declining unemployment and inflation rates . If jobless and inflation rates remain high , the spending boost would be greater . If the projections are accurate ? and the Congressional Budget Office ( CBO ) says that , if anything , they are too low ? Mr. Carter 's maneuvering room on new programs may be very small . Any new federal spending either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pledged to balance the budget by 1981 ? or would require equivalent sltshes in other programs . The President-Elect now is considering a quick stimulus to the economy , either in the form of a tax cut , rebate of taxes already paid , or fresh spending . Such a stimulant might in effect use up Mr. Carter 's " new program " money for fiscal 1978 , which begins Oct. 1 , 1977 , unless he decides to risk a larger budget deficit . President Ford 's advisers believe that any additional government spending , over the minimum required by law , would be inflationary . Some Democratic economists say there is // From page 1 *U.S. deficit warnings for Carter enough slack in the economy to permit stiintilus without danger of inflation . Mr. Ford , in any event , in the fiscal 1978 budget he is required to deliver to Congress in January , can be expected to avoid new federal programs ? to keep the inevitable spending increase , in other words , as close to $35 billion as possible . It then becomes Mr. Carter 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ budget committees , to adapt the proposed Ford budget to-the goals of the new Democratic White House-congressional team . Some analysts foresee conflict developing between Mr. Carter , as President , and liberal Demoerats in Congress over how much to spend and for what programs . Mr. Carter repeatedly has said he will sponsor only those programs that do not threaten progress toward his goal of a balanced budget by the end of his four-year term . With job-creating efforts high on his agenda , programs such as national health insurancemay be pushed into the background , except at the study level . Already the AFL-CIO , big city mayors , Northeastern state governors , and black groups are beginning to press claims on the President-Elect . Latest figures from the OMB , detailing how much federal spending is due to rise under present law , may force Mr. Carter to choose carefully among spending requests . High unemployment affects government operations in two ways , reducing tax revenues and enlarging unemployment compensation payments . Thus an immediate priority of the incoming Carter team is to reduce the jobless rate below @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . OMB 's " optimistic " projeciton of a $35 billion spending increase , next year is based on an average unemployment rate of 6.4 percent in 1977 and 5.5 percent the following year . This year 's average is expected to be 7.6 or 7.7 percent .
