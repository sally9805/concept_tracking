txt Jimmy Carter can be defeated in portions of the South if Republicans can slap a " liberal " label on him . . . . That is the word Southern Republicans are giving President Ford as he maps campaign strategy with advisers this week in Vail , Colorado . Republicans here argue that vigorous effort against Mr. Carter in the South is essential for several reasons : ? It would give Mr. Ford a good shot at Texas , Florida , and Virginia , and possibly provide upsets in other states . ? It would force Mr. Carter to spend valuable time protecting his own backyard . ? It would give Mr. Ford an ideal setting to exploit " liberal " Carter positions which are at variance with the region 's traditional conservatism . ? It could improve Mr. Ford 's prospects , since no president has been elected in recent years without support from . the South . A well-known Republican just back from strategy sessions in Vail says the South represents the President 's " hidden opportunity . " He observes that former President Richard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1972 ? and the Reptiblican potential here remains great . The official denies press reports that Mr. Ford has decided to write off the " cotton South " ? states like South Carolina , Georgia , Alabama , and Mississippi . Those reports were checked by Southern officials with Richard Cheney , the White House chief of staff , who responded that campaign planning was still incomplete , including the part on Southern strategy . Southerners are reminding Ford aides that the President specifically told the delegates from Mississippi that he would run a national campaign that excluded no region . Polls in the South are discouraging for Republicans , but party officials here claim that will change quickly . // From page 1 *Ford told how to dent the South A recent Harris poll showed , for instance , that 56 percent of the Carter supporters in the South were " very strong " in their belief that he is the best candidate . Such a rating is judged very high . Yet because of the conservative Republican platform adopted in Kansas City , and Mr. Ford 's own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as good here as anywhere else in the country . " " The odds have been long , but are getting shorter , " says a South Carolina official . " The TV debates are going to help immeasurably ; they will help people see it is really a contest between liberals and conservatives . " Also helping Republicans will be the absence of " the Wallace factor . " In past elections , the third-party effort of Gov . George C. Wallace of Alabama drew conservative voters away from Republicans . It probably helped Democrats hold on to a state like Texas in 1968 . Governor Wallace is expected to go on the campaign trail for Mr. Carter , but Republicans would much rather have him on the stump than on the ballot . Florida is a state where Wallace voters could hold the balance of power . Republicans there expect that by election day , the Carter-Ford race will be even in populist central and southern Florida . The balance of power will be held in north Florida , Wallace country , they.predict . With Ronald Reagan and John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ford scoring conservative points with Mr. Carter during TV debates , Republicans express confidence that north Florida will be theirs .
