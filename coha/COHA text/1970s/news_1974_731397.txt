txt The Palestine guerrilla leadership has left ajar the door to its possible participation in the future Middle East peace conference in Geneva . Analysts here see in the decisions of the Palestine National Council session of June 1-9 in Cairo the start of a double offensive ? diplomatic and military ? to get the Palestine question onto the agenda at Geneva . The council decided by a majority vote of its 179 members that Palestinians could not attend the Geneva conference ? and so far none have been invited to do so ? as long as UN Security Council Resolution 242 ( the basic decision on Mideast peace used by the United Nations and big powers since its passage in 19673 - is not amended . ( Lord Caradon , the British diplomat who as British UN representative drafted the resolution in November , 1967 , told a Jordan television audience Saturday that if he were in a position to rewrite the resolution , he would make it take account of " new realities " since the October , 1973 , Arab-Israel war . He said Mideast peace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Palestinians. ) // *Palestine and Geneva // The PLO wants the mention of " refugees " in Resolution 242 deleted and the phrase " national rights of the Palestinian people " inserted instead . Two main steps are now needed to bring about PLO attendance at Geneva , Arab affairs analysts here say . First , a new UN Security Council formula of some sort will have to revise or bypass Resolution 242 . Syria , Algeria , and other Arab states would have Soviet backing in such a move , East-bloc sources here say . Second , inter-Arab consultations and possibly an Arab summit will have to try to persuade King Hussein of Jordan to accept full participation of the PLO . Jordan position firm King Hussein 's position up to now is that Jordan 's Geneva delegation should be responsible for recovering the West bank and East Jerusalem from Israel , whereas the PLO 's jurisdiction should extend only to Palestinian territory taken by Israel before 1967 . New Israeli Prime Minister Itzhak Rabin said in his inaugural speech last week that Israel would not agree to any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to now has been that Palestinians should be included in the Jordan national delegation . The Palestine National Council , by electing a new leadership last week in which all the main guerrilla groups included in the Palestine Liberation Organization ( PLO ) are represented , has strengthened the hand of PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat and the majority who follow him , according to Palestinians who attended the Cairo conference . Mr. Arafat has retained his leadership . But among new members of the council 's 14-member executive committee announced Sunday is Ahmed Jabril , who heads the radical Popular Front-General Command organization , which carried out the guerrilla attack on the Israeli town of Qiryat Shmona last month . The nearly one million Palestinians living under Israeli occupation in the Jordan West Bank and Gaza areas are also represented in the new committee by " Abu Meissen , " the pseudonym of a prominent West Bank man who was one of eight West Bankers deported by Israeli occupation authorities last December . After many hours of furious debate in which the Jabril faction , the Iraqi-backed Arab Liberation Front , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George Habbash opposed all Geneva participation or establishment of a Palestine " national authority " on territory given up by Israel , the decision about altering Resolution 242 was incorporated in a 10-point program adopted by the council . Its reaffirmation of the " national authority " idea reflects hope among Palestinian leaders that President Nixon , on his Mideast trip this week , will approve the idea and try to convince King Hussein of Jordan that he should too . Jordan 's position has been that Jordanian sovereignty must be reestablished before the West Bank population can express its wishes about the future . Leeway for a new emergency council session to meet if the PLO is invited to Geneva was left by a council resolution which said such a session could be convoked " if a fateful situation arises affecting the future of the Palestinian people . " Earlier , Mr. Arafat repeated that he was prepared to go to Geneva if the council should ask him to . It did not .                 @ @ @ @
