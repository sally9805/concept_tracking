A hunting trip can be a series of flashes , the least important of which is the one that grows from the barrel of a gun . // We are blasting down U.S. 93 from Missoula to Hamilton in Mel 's broad-shouldered Ford van . November in Montana . The Bitterroot Mountains rise around us , tall and impersonal , so unlike the humanized mountains of the East or even the West Coast . These are hard mountains , black-faced with fir and pine , that do n't give a damn who dies on them . Lewis and Clark 's men had to tighten their belts here in the fall of 1805 ; the roots they gnawed to supplement their jerky supplies were bitter . These are not the sort of mountains you want to stare at for any length of time . They are too complex in their geology and history , too big in every dimension to soothe the soul . // It 's snug in the van , though . Mel has the heater turned up high , and over the radio Loretta Lynn is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has that special timbre , somewhere between a sneer and a snivel , common to road-house cocktail waitresses and lady country singers . Mel opens a fresh tin of Copenhagen . I tuck a hefty pinch in my lower lip and the juices start to flow . It 's a nicotine hit unlike any other  --  a small , warm , friendly explosion in the chilly caverns of the skull . // " Nope , " says Mel , " they ai n't come down off the peaks yet . They 're still on top , lyin ' up by day in the lodgepole tangles and feedin ' at night . Plenty of sign , though , up in the Skalkaho Country . " He rolls down the window and squirts a shot of snuff juice into the slipstream ; the left side of his van bears a ragged , tan racing stripe . " Me and Harold , we was up there just yesterday . Deer sign lower down , but all the elk sign was way up near the top . We 'll have to climb for ' em @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cold , clean mountain air disappears in a blast of heat and song and Bull Durham smoke . // Melvin McNeal , strawberry rancher . A strange , almost sissified occupation for a mountain man , but then the times have changed drastically since the firm of Bridger , Beckwourth &amp; Broken Hand , Unltd. closed shop . Put Mel on a mountainside , though , and his true nature shines like a beaver pelt . The swift , shuffling gait that never varies , uphill or down . The quick , sneaky , game-seeking eyes common to muggers and born hunters . Bent-shouldered , big-knuckled , as spare of words as he is of flesh , Mel McNeal would not have been out of place 150 years ago , riding down into the Great Basin on the back of a raddled mule with a Hawken over his pommel and Jedediah Strong Smith leading the way . His scruffy , rust-colored beard underscores the image . " I wo n't shave again until I 've got a bull elk in the meat shed , " he says . // Already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dim , sweet , frigid air of the shed behind his house . The smell of hanging game has always seemed exciting to me  --  a ranker , wilder smell than that of the beeves and swine we used to whiff in the butcher shops before the supermarkets took over and hid all meat from the senses , under plastic . I suppose that in the smell of slow putrefaction there resides some arcane folk memory , the promise of full bellies for the tribe . Mel 's two deer , young and tender but pathetically small without their heads , hides and guts , dangle from the roof beam by their ankles . I lay a hand on one of them : smooth , hard , cold . Like the Bitterroots , where he killed them earlier in the season . // Mel 's yard is a bit of a zoo . Peacocks and guinea fowl scamper around , kicking the gravel and nattering at one another in the incessant warfare of the bird world . Domestic mallards waddle up , blatting for a handout . These are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wild mallards that have dropped in , uninvited , to spend the winter with Mel 's pen-raised flock . " Aw , I like having birds around , " he explains . " Not just for the eggs and the meat , either . It 's more the idea  --  peacocks in Montana ! They 're a tough bird , though . They hold their own pretty good against the foxes and the hawks and the coyotes . And the neighbor dogs are flat skeered of ' em ! " // Out beyond the yard is a pond full of icy water and Kamloops rainbow trout . Mel calls them " cannaloops , " confusing their real name , which comes from the distant Pacific Northwest , with " cantaloupes , " and in a way they are like melons to him : starved for trout , all he need do is pick up a rod , hike through the yard , flip a spinner into the pond and come home with a couple of three-pounders . For his serious fishing he heads for the mountains . // Deer stew and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shy , plump woman who blushes readily at compliments about her cooking ( " Nothin ' much , " she says ) . Like so many mountain women she takes her skills for granted , makes little of them , unaware of their natural beauty and her own . Instead , she affects an air of weariness and worthlessness , tempered with flashes of desperate independence which she has probably learned from the huge face of the color television set that dominates the McNeals ' small living room . The only book in the house is a Bible . Now and then she flares angrily at her two sons , Sean and Max , themselves shy boys still under the tutelage of women , but her rages are perfunctory , ritualistic and immediately followed by a lot of loving . The boys will be O.K. once they are allowed to think of themselves as men . // In the bedroom hang Mel 's trophies . A royal elk of seven points , a wide-racked whitetail deer , a solemn mountain goat , a pronghorn antelope , a pair of black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an elderly bull bison that Mel tracked down and killed in Yellowstone country years ago . The presence of the dead animals in the bedroom is at once awesome and ridiculous . It would be like making love in a wing of the Museum of Natural History . I am put in mind of a remark my daughter made when she was three years old and saw her first mounted deer head . She stared at it for a long time , then said firmly , " The rest of him lives in the wall . " // That night we take a run up the mountain in Mel 's jeep , heading for a salt lick that the elk sometimes visit on their way down from the peaks to their wintering grounds in the high valleys . The idea is not to kill , but to see if they are moving , and if so , just who is doing the moving  --  cows and yearling calves , or the big bulls we are seeking . Though the autumn has been a strange one , fraught with warm weather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the rut by now . If so , they will be banding together again in their bachelor gangs and replacing the meat and muscle they lost over the past month during their titanic mating battles and their long-winded , randy chases after the cows . If the bulls are moving down the mountain it will make our hunt that much easier . The closer to the valley , the handier the roads , the shorter the distance we will have to drag our kill . A bull elk can weigh 600 pounds , gutted . If we kill one at the top of the mountain , we will have to cache it somewhere and then return for Mel 's donkey , Jenny , to pack the meat and the trophy out . " We can do ' er , " Mel says , " but it ai n't no fun . " // At the foot of the mountain we rendezvous with Mel 's hunting partner , Harold Nelson . He , too , is slumped and bearded in the image of the mountain men but , in contrast to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The eyes behind his granny glasses squint and sparkle . We can almost hear him creak as he climbs into the jeep  --  he suffers from emphysema and a spinal fusion , he announces , the result of too many smokes and a fall from a cliff some years back . He was once shot by another hunter , over in Idaho where he was born , and now refuses to wear red or Day-Glo orange clothing in the field for fear that he will make an easy target . He has a low opinion of most hunters , including Mel . // " Your average hunter , " he says , " is like a dog chasin ' a car . Even if he catches it , he do n't know how to drive . " // Winding up the mountain in the dark , Mel asks Harold how his love life is. // " Waal , " says Harold , lighting up a cigarette to feed his emphysema , " it used to be wine , women and song . Now it 's Metrecal , the old gal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him Count Nelson down in the valley , one of those negative nicknames , like a fat boy known as Skinny . Yet he is an authentic American original , tough and human , a man whose only lies are told at the expense of the world 's cruelty and for the amusement of his friends . He damns all citybound ecologists as " flower sniffers , " and cuts Christmas trees for a winter 's living , yet in the days I walked the mountains with him I discovered that he knew the names of all the birds , beasts , trees , mosses , rocks , lichens , clouds and peaks much better than the field guides I had brought with me . He kills meat to feed his family . " You know , " he said one afternoon as we rested on the sunnyside slope of a frozen peak , " there really ought to be only one man hunting this country . That way it would n't get drained of meat so quick , and all the flowers would n't get trompled down . I hate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you who that man ought a be . Harold Nelson . " // " How old do you reckon Harold is ? " Mel asks . // " Oh , " after a long pause , " about 193. " // " He 's 39. " // At the salt lick , nothing but deer sign . The elk are still up high . Winding back down the mountain we pick up the brassy flash of eyes in the headlights . " Coyote , " says Mel . " Kill the bastard ! " says Harold . Mel stops the jeep . He opens the driver-side door and steps out with his .243 Browning lever-action rifle , takes a rest on the door and shoots . The eyes wink out and we see a long , yellow shape skipping away through the night . Mel shoots again . " Nailed him ! " Harold walks up the road and comes back holding the coyote by the brush . It is a bitch , a young one . The first bullet shattered her right front leg , which dangles by a shredded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her tongue lolls and her eyes are not yet glazed . Harold cuts off her tail with a clasp knife and slings the carcass back into the woods  --  " for the magpies. " // Fortuitous killing offends me . A man should know what he intends to kill , should seek out the particular object of his murderous instincts , seek it out as an individual , know its habits and its track , how they differ from others of its kind , and understand the meaning of his own heart as the gun fires . Otherwise killing is gluttony . God knows I have killed animals indiscriminately in my life , but their deaths haunt me . Those acts were far more grievous sins than any lies , cruelties or infidelities I have perpetrated on my human victims . A lie , a putdown or an infidelity is a calculated act ; Headhunting is simply gratuitous . I seethe silently for a while , then bluntly ask Mel and Harold why they gunned down the coyote . After all , a coyote eats mainly mice and carrion ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is misunderstood in that regard ; studies prove they do n't kill that many domestic animals , and even if they did .... // " That 's how we do around here , " says Harold . // " Shoot , " says Mel , injured , " it 's just a coyote .... " // I flash , and it 's as brief , as bright as the muzzle blast from Mel 's rifle ... the people I 've hurt too often . Then Mel passes the snuff tin around . We load our lips and head for the barn , talking normally again . // The next day we leave before dawn to hunt Deer Mountain , a peak to the southeast of Hamilton . The sun , when it finally arrives , reveals a terrifying aspect . The roads that climb these mountains are little better than the tracks of a snail climbing a beanstalk . Slick , thin , the merest translucence on a steep surface , they wind around and around , aimlessly following the line of least gravitational resistance . To look down from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mel drives loosely , turning his head to talk . Thank God he is no chatterbox ! // The best approach is to study the distant mountains . Trapper Peak and Sleeping Child . Lost Horse and The Lonesome Bachelor : my Forest Service map dispels acrophobia as effectively as a tranquilizer might paranoia . I sink back into the gray dust of geography and history , adrift and happy in a world of long-dead trappers and distant , sleeping children . Harold peels an orange from his lunch pail and the sharp romanticism of citrus fills the jeep . Then he curses the fibers that stick between his teeth . At the top , Mel parks the jeep and we dismount , stiff and groggy , to check our rifles . // " Colder'n a mother-in-law 's heart , " says Harold , his orange-scented breath pluming in the early light . We 're up in the snow , more than 7,000 feet at this point , and the air bites the jaws like a dentist 's drill . Still , it 's not much snow  --  three inches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crossed on the road has been that of deer . // " We 'll poke around for a while up yere , " says Mel , " and if we do n't jump any elk we may find deer . Take ' em if you see ' em  --  in this district you 're allowed two on your license , either sex . Kill any grouse that you see . They 're good lunch meat for tomorrow . We do n't hunt ' em up here like you do back East . These are fool hens , wo n't flush worth diddly . They either stand and squawk at you or else jump up into the trees and figger they 're safe . Shoot their heads off . If you see an elk or a deer , shoot for the heart  --  well , you know that anyway . I do n't hold with these gut-shootin ' fellers or these dudes that take whey they call ' haunch shots ' on a running meat critter . Waste a lot of time that way , tracking them out . " He spits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noon . " // It was the longest speech he ever made . // In terms of big game the day is a washout . But in terms of coming to an understanding with this vast , cold-hearted country it could not be more successful . Mel and Harold shoulder their " crowbars "  --  a rifle is a workman 's tool in these parts  --  and amble downhill into the snowy pines . Their footfalls and voices fade even before they are out of sight . Lesson No. 1 : sound travels vertically in this vertical country . A man with a broken leg could shout his head off , empty his rifle with distress shots and not be heard by his partner a few hundred yards away . I head uphill with my own partner , a lean Californian named Roger Ferry who is also my brother-in-law . Roger is tall , soft-spoken , bespectacled , a consummate woodsman who grew up as a deer hunter in the fiat , tamarack and muskeg country of northern Wisconsin . Like so many of us from that land of waning opportunity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call it  --  he went West . Though he majored in French literature at Marquette University and had ambitions to write when he was younger , he now runs a small home-improvements business in Sacramento . Being his own boss , he has plenty of time for the pursuit of his true vocation : hunting and fishing . // We pause at the crest of Deer Mountain , Roger to glass the country for game , I to catch my breath . My knees have turned to water with the climb and , despite the cold , most of it is squirting out through my sweat glands . In this thin air , not yet acclimated to the altitude , I stand about as much chance of catching my breath as I would of catching Frank Shorter in the marathon . Roger , by contrast , is fresh as a sprig of alpine rue . He quit smoking years ago for just this reason . // " Nothing moving but an eagle , " he says , putting down the glasses . " Away over there , across the valley . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it down a bit around the edges , you 'd have a perfect lid for the whole Pacific Ocean . " // We split up and swing across the shoulder of the mountain , hoping that one of us will push a deer , or maybe even an elk , out of its bed and into range of the other . The wind up here groans like a god with a bellyache . The ponderosa pines and Douglas firs  --  some of them mature giants , uncut during the big logging boom of the 1890s because of their remote locations  --  sway and clatter and yowl under the push of the north wind , but at ground level the air is still . Except for a few ravens that croak their ragged way overhead , bitching at the wind that keeps pushing them off course , and an occasional camp robber , the mountain seems empty of life . I see some old deer sign and the tracks of a coyote that came through the previous afternoon when the snow was still wet with the afternoon 's relative warmth ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but are blurred and splashy around the edges . // Then I catch a flicker of movement in the lodgepoles below me . Sitting , I glass the thicket with my scope . The gray twitch resolves itself into an ear . Then a wet brown eye leaps out of the neutrality of the background . Then I see the animal whole : a mule deer doe . It always amazes me when they snap into focus that way , and I wonder how many I have passed , and how close , that I never did see . // Mel said to take ' em  --  either sex . My mind does its quick rationalization number : I sure could use the meat . I bring the crosshairs down the crease behind her shoulder , a nervous optical caress . She is at least 300 yards away . The scope is jumping rhythmically , just the faintest of up-and-down movements , but enough to ruin my shot if I take it . I expel my breath , but the jumping continues . My heartbeat . I start the squeeze anyway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I see out of the corner of the scope another muley behind her  --  a buck , only a crotch-horn , a two-pointer , but a buck  --  and in that instant the rifle goes bang . The snow jumps . The two deer disappear . // A clean miss . My hands are shaking . // There is no blood in the snow where she stood , and I see where the bullet dug a trench in the dirt beneath it . It 's a deep hole , like the kind we used to shoot marbles at in the schoolyard . Marbles and murder : I 'm glad I missed her . // Back at the jeep , Mel and Harold are building a fire . They drag up a few snow-sodden pine logs , drench them with gasoline from the spare jerrican and flip a match into the heap . Kapow ! Instant bonfire . I wonder what Bridger would think of the technique , as opposed to flint and steel . He 'd probably approve . Those men were nothing if not pragmatic . Later , Roger tails @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He surprised them in a brake down the mountain , and when they flew up into a nearby ponderosa he headed them , one , two , just like that . Just like Mel said . // That night , skunked , we hit the saloons of Hamilton to recharge our depleted spirits . Most of the patrons are ranchers and drovers . They shake their heads solemnly at Mel 's account of our failure , offering suggestions for the morrow . " Use to be a lot of big old bulls down thereon Hog Trough Creek , on the backside of Black Bear Point . " Too durn early for that country . " How about Water Sign Meadows , or farther on down by the One Tooth Cabin ? " Too durn far . White Stallion , Two Bear , Sawdust Gulch , Railroad Creek  --  all have their drawbacks . We sulk over our beers , listening to Merle Haggard on the juke . " I 'm a Lonesome Fugitive .... " // The light in the bar is warm and minimal , the colors from the jukebox @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the signs on the walls of backcountry saloons  --  a form of Americana that has largely disappeared from the cities : // " No Shirts , No Shoes , No Service ! ( Bras optional ) . " // " My heart ees yors , but my ass is zee government's. " // " Of all the purebred strains , the Herefords and Black Angus have attained the greatest popularity in Montana . " // " Yea , though I walk through the Valley of the Shadow of Death , I shall fear no evil ... ' Cause I 'm the MEANEST SON OF A BITCH IN THE VALLEY ! " // Harold cocks his white cowboy hat back on his brow and shrugs his sheepskin jacket higher on his shoulders  --  he 'd duded up , clotheswise , here in town . He even smells pretty good , having gone home for a shower . His glasses catch the glint of light from the jukebox and he stares at us like the sunset of a rainy day , after the clouds have passed . // " All right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us , " tomorrow we 'll hit the Skalkaho Country . She 's a mean ' un , so cold up there you could milk a cow in chunks . But that 's where the noble wapiti is right now , and that 's where we 'll get ' em . " // The morning , still hours before dawn , is not black but rather a dirty gray . The vaulting sky suffers from ring around the collar . It snowed during the night , and walking out into the cold we feel a sudden surge of hope . The new snow has to help us . Mel 's ducks and guineas and peacocks seem to sense our good spirits : they cluster around , even though it 's long before their usual wake-up hour , yammering for breakfast . So what  --  our own breakfasts are still warm and heavy in our bellies  --  scrambled eggs , beans , venison steaks cooked up by a sleepy Jan in her housecoat , in that rich , warm kitchen . " Good luck , " she says , then scurries back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes of the big gone bison . We climb into the jeep and head for the Skalkaho Country . // The climb is not nearly so fearsome this morning , despite the fresh snow that slicks the tracks . Mel has the same faith in the surefootedness of his jeep as the oldtimers had in their ponies , and it is faith more than anything that makes for good driving . Roger even dozes off during some of the steeper stretches , with the jeep swooping down horse trails like a World War II Stuka with its dive-brakes extended . Harold chatters on and on about his eldest son , a 17-year-old who has broken his back three times in car crashes . In the most recent one he hit a tree at 90 miles an hour . " He 's a hell-raiser like his old man , " Harold self-congratulates . " Like they say , only the good die young . " Another son , 15 years old , is a nationally ranked high school wrestler . Harold is proud of him , too . // We top out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jeep in four-wheel drive and low-low , and with the brakes virtually locked , down what he claims is a trail but which looks more like a cliff . We cross a creek , red in the light of the sunrise . Then we follow a logging trail beside it . Deer and elk tracks spot the fresh snow ; we may be pushing them ahead of us . At the end of the logging trail Mel parks the jeep . To our left the mountain rises higher still , straight up it seems , its slope ( if such it was ) studded with ponderosas. // " At the top she levels off , " says Mel . " It 's fairly open along the ridge line , but there 's thick lodgepole tangles on either side the shoulder . The elk are lyin ' up in them jungles there . You and Roger climb on up there and then split up and work down along the ridge line toward the east . Me and Harold 'll go back down to the end of the ridge and come up slow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " // " And if you do n't know which way 's east , " adds Harold , " I can loan you my North Dakotian compass . " He pulls out a woman 's powder compact and opens the mirrored lid . " It do n't show you where to go , but it shore shows you who 's lost ! " Haw , Haw . // The climb is a killer , but thanks to the new snow there is inspiration at every halt . Elk sign galore . Vast stretches of raw dirt mixed in with pine needles where the bulls have been tussling . Mounds of fresh droppings , some of them still warm at the core . Saplings rubbed raw earlier in the autumn when the bulls were polishing their antlers for the rutting battles , the red bark of the skinny trees dangling like a teen-ager 's braids . At the top we halt . The sun is just coming visible over the rolling rock ahead of us . The big red ball again . // " I 'll drop down here to the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the ridge . You stay just on this side of the crest . Let 's move along real slow and easy , like you 'd still-hunt the swamps up near Eagle River in Wisconsin . Stay about a couple hundred yards apart . I 'll whistle every now and then to let you know where I am , and you whistle back . " // I push out along the ridge , pausing five counts for every five steps I 've taken . The old angst rises along the back of my neck  --  air prickles , my skin as sensitive to sound as a fever victim 's to the touch of a breeze . All the senses peak in moments like this , all the tastes come flooding back to distill themselves on the tongue , blood and breakfast . My eyes seem to widen and deepen in my head , huge light-suckers , vacuums that draw in every color , every shadow , every movement . The tension on the nerves and muscles  --  latent death  --  rises with every step and redoubles with every pause . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taut senses of a hunter at the end of a stalk , he would die at the age of three .... // The first crashing sound hits me like a truck coming around a blind corner . I wonder for an instant if Roger has fallen off a cliff . Then the bull elk tops the rise , galloping like a horse , and swings his huge head to look at me . I stare into his big brown eye and he keeps right on going , watching me watch him go , the wide rack steady over his hammerlike head , his neck low  --  and I do n't even get the rifle to my shoulder before he 's gone . Damn , I 'm thinking , they do n't run like deer at all . // And then the second bull appears , half a second behind the first one . He 's smaller by a bit , and he pauses in his gallop to look at me , slowing to a trot . I snap off a shot and kick dirt under his belly . Off he goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a hunter am I , stupid , no-good .... // And then the third bull appears . The third bull ! Someone loves me ! Unconsciously I have moved up the ridge toward the spot where the animals are crossing , and now as this bull slows to stare at me I have dropped to one knee and the rifle is steady and the crosshairs touch the spot behind his shoulder and as he moves I swing with him and the rifle goes bang . I see the guard hairs fly over his heart . He leaps ahead , down the mountain , out of sight , and I can hear his jumps  --  one , two , three , four , five , six , then a pause  --  and then a heavy thud that seems to shake the earth .... // Over the knoll ahead of me , snow hazes down from a pair of quivering spruce trees . I move up quickly and quietly and look downhill . The elk is down . In his dying flight , out of control , he crashed through a dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ones that produced the snow shower . He lies on his left side , his legs flexing . He is big as a horse , umber-colored , touched with cream and dark brown , dying . As I stand there watching him die , the big feeling washes over me again : bigger than guilt and pride , though akin to them , bigger even than love and loss , though their brothers , and I flash on down through time to the men who crawled deep into the earth to paint their prey by torchlight on the wet , cold walls , and then crawled out again to kill meat , their god . // Roger comes over the rise and looks at the dead elk. // " Hey ! " he says . " You got one ! " // The rest of a day like that goes slow , gutting the game , dragging it down through a mile of stumps and gullies and fallen timber . A creature that size takes its own small revenge for its murder , in the form of barked shins and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oldtimers were n't right in their meat-hungry philosophy : eat it as it lays . But all of that is the malaise of anticlimax . At the bottom of the mountain I stopped and lay on my belly in the snow and drank from the stream  --  the water clean and brassy cold . I walked back up to where the bull lay . Steam rose from his open body cavity , sweet in the cold . Mel looked at him , deadpan behind his rusty beard . Harold stroked his own scruffy chin . // " Could n't have picked a nicer bull if you tried , " he said . " He ai n't the biggest , but the rack is perfectly even . You do n't find that too often in a young bull . And the meat will be good eatin ' , which you do n't find in the Boone and Crockett class . You 'll have the head mounted , of course ? " // Of course . And now , with the head on my wall and the meat in my freezer , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of me as the meanest son of a bitch ' in the valley , but I still have my flashes intact : Mel , Harold , Jan , Roger , and a country even meaner than I. A country that , if hammered flat , could cover the whole Pacific Ocean . I hope it never happens .
