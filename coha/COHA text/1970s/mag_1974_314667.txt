As the Nixon Administration sped to its end , Washington correspondents - packed into muggy briefing rooms , scrambling to salvage facts from an avalanche of rumors-might have succumbed to some very human emotions . They might have been gleeful over the final agony of their longtime antagonist , or at least exhilarated to report one of the biggest stories of their time . In fact , exuberance was rare . Said Chicago Daily News Washington Bureau Chief Peter Lisagor : " There was an inexorability to it all , and it turned into a death watch . " CBS Correspondent Dan Rather echoed that mood when he described TV coverage of resignation night as " perhaps a little too funereal . " <P> Somber Mood . Indeed , the solemnity of a presidential abdication masked the hostility that many felt on both sides . Newsmen studiously avoided gloating , and neither Nixon nor his aides renewed their old attacks on the press . Within two hours of the resignation speech , Press Secretary Ronald Ziegler went to the podium of the White House briefing room for the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " of the startled reporters before him . Ziegler had become the unhappy symbol of White House deception , and his paean to the press drew a few titters . But there was none of the rancorous repartee that had marked so many White House briefings during the previous two years . <P> Some of the reporters could not quite understand their own somber mood . Chicago Tribune Correspondent Jim Squires phoned an editor at his home office and said , " I 've been fighting the guy for 18 months , but suddenly I ca n't get excited about his quitting . " At the Washington Post , Executive Editor Ben Bradlee ordered his staff not to talk to outside journalists . The Post , pre-eminent leader in Watergate coverage , had made enough news . The conflict was over and now Bradlee wanted simply to report events . When a Women 's Wear Daily reporter penetrated Bradlee 's office , the executive editor personally ejected her with the admonition : " This is not the place to be writing about . " In Boston , Globe Editor Tom Winship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his newsroom staff , then remarked quietly : " He went out with dignity . " <P> Whatever the personal feelings of reporters and editors , their output last week was enormous . Coverage , both in print and on the air , virtually enveloped the nation , reaching a high point on Thursday night and Friday . <P> Other watershed events-John Kennedy 's assassination and Lyndon Johnson 's renunciation of a second full term , for instance-could not have been predicted . This time there was ample opportunity to prepare . <P> At major newspapers , the wire services and TV networks , executives had been thinking about the possibility of a sudden vacancy in the White House since the first batch of tape transcripts was released April 30 . ABC News President Elmer Lower began looking ahead even earlier : in June 1973 he recommended that outlines of coverage of a Nixon departure be drawn up ; by Jan. 14 of this year , the network 's SEEP ( Special Events Emergency Plan ) was fleshed out on paper . Prepared over several months , the New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pages on the Nixon presidency .
