txt " Is the government going to become the national nanny ? " asked an exasperated Lowell P. Weicker of Connecticut during a recent debate over government regulation . The Republican Senator 's question touched a sensitive spot in Washington these days . Government has moved on a thousand fronts to protect the public from dirty water , dirty air , unsafe cars , dangerous working conditions , unwholesome meat , untested drugs , and even TV ads for candy bars . Meanwhile , statisticians observe that the average bureaucrat , with almost total job security , makes $12,168 a year . In the private sector , the average pay is $11,487 . The less-well-paid appear to support the better-off . Some public servants live better than the people they serve . Even this might be tolerable if the schools were getting better , crime were going down , streets were cleaner . Instead , pollster Louis Harris says his latest surveys show a continuing crisis of public confidence in government . Are things going to far ? Senator Weicker suggests they have . Bureaucratic government has mushroomed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything expected a couple decades ago . A three-part Monitor series , which begins today , notes that heavy government spending at the federal , state , and local levels draws much of the ire of taxpayers . President Carter this year proposed the country 's first half-trillion-dollar budget . But a second big game in Washington today is regulation . There are rules for just about everything . You ca n't paddle a canoe , build a house , repair a car , stuff a pillow , design a bicycle , push a lawnmower , construct a ladder , fly a plane , or dye an Easter egg without running into a federal rule . The American colonists rioted over a tax on tea . Today , Americans pay taxes on just about everything they eat , drink , or wear . The omnivorous Internal Revenue Service looks ahead to even more taxes covering employee " fringe benefits , " such as free parking , store discounts , company picnics , employer-provided child care , and transportation passes . The crisis is hitting home with some leaders in Washington , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maine . They feel the United States must begin to search for ways to control the budget , get rid of useless programs , and achieve more effectiveness in essential government services . The alternative could be a " tax revolt " that may already be under way . First of a series : Page 14
