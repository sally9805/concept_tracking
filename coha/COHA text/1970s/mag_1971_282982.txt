Like an ominous winter fog , labor strikes have spread across much of West Germany . First , 120,000 metal workers stomped out of 82 plants . Then employers counterattacked by locking out another 360,000 workers at more than 500 factories . Six Daimler-Benz and Audi NSU plants were shut down , and the rest of the German auto industry was expected to suspend production . The union demanded a 9% to 11% pay increase , the companies offered 4.5% , and a mediation team proposed 7.5% under a seven-month contract . The union accepted the compromise , but the employers said nein . <P> Germany 's worst strike in eight years is only the latest example of the contagion of labor unrest sweeping Europe . In Britain , strikes have cost 13 million work days this year . In Sweden , a siege of labor trouble affected almost every segment of the work force , including teachers , civil servants and army officers . The situation has been worst of all in Italy where , since the au-tunno caldo ( hot autumn ) of 1969 , total @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become endemic in Italy . Last week 's strikers included tens of thousands of workers in Milan , 50,000 civil servants and some cinema actors and customs inspectors . Even the employees of the Treasury Ministry walked out for two days , creating confusion at the meetings of the Group of Ten and leaving only one Xerox machine in operation for all delegations . <P> Rising Costs . Aside from inconvenience and damage to production , the strikes will have important consequences for the trading relationship between the U.S. and Europe . Reason : labor costs are rising more sharply in most of Europe than in America . At Volkswagen , wages rose 6% in 1969 , 15% in 1970 and another 16% this year . At Daimler-Benz , the ratio of labor costs to total sales has climbed from 21% to 26% in the past decade . Historically , in European industry 's competition for world markets , its lower wages have counteracted the U.S. 's higher productivity , which is a result of many factors , including the quantity and quality of the U.S. 's capital equipment and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gap still exists . Comparisons between U.S. and European pay scales are difficult because of the varying fringe benefits involved ; however , the average Italian auto worker earns about $2.50 an hour , while the average auto assembler in the U.S. makes about $4.40 . But the gap is narrowing . <P> According to the Department of Commerce , U.S. labor costs rose 4.9% last year , while those of Britain increased 10.8% and Italy 's 14% . Germany 's jumped 23% , reflecting not only wage increases but also the fact that in the past two years the mark has been revalued upward by 20% in relation to the dollar . U.S. wages were 104% higher than Sweden 's a decade ago , but today are only 45% higher .
