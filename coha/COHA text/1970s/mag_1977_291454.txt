LANCELOT <P> by WALKER PERCY <P> 257 pages . Farrar , Straus &; Giroux . <P> $8.95 . <P> <P> Although he has been called a novelist of ideas , Walker Percy , 60 , is less a philosopher than a physician to the public weal . Tuberculosis prevented him from using the M.D. he earned in 1941 , but The Moviegoer ( 1962 ) , Percy 's first novel and a National Book Award winner , demonstrated his remarkable diagnostic skill . In it and two later novels , he specialized in asking probing questions : Why are people with every outward trapping of happiness so miserable ? Where and why does it hurt ? <P> Lancelot Andrewes Lamar is Percy 's most painful case to date . A Rhodes scholar and onetime football hero , he goes to seed in classic Southern style . He takes up the law , drink and the care of a rundown showplace home near New Orleans . Only when he suspects the infidelity of his second wife , Margot , a brassy Texan worth $10 million , does Lancelot realize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had done nothing but fiddle at law , fiddle at history , keep up with the news ( why ? ) , watch Mary Tyler Moore , and drink myself into unconsciousness every night . " <P> Flagrante Delicto . Not any longer . Lancelot changes overnight from a catatonic lush into a quixotic detective . Proving Margot 's waywardness is the least of his worries ; her suspected lover is the director of a Hollywood film crew currently making a movie at Lancelot 's picturesque mansion . With unlimited funds and the help of a black M.I.T. student who is an electronics wizard , Lancelot has no trouble assembling incriminating video tapes . But he wants more than to film Margot flagrante delicto . Lancelot is on the trail of evil and an affirmation that it still has meaning . Says he : " ' Evil ' is surely the clue to this age , the only quest appropriate to the age . For everything and everyone 's either wonderful or sick and nothing is evil . " <P> Lancelot 's pursuit of what he calls " the Unholy Grail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He , in turn , is committed to a New Orleans insane asylum , where he has one room with a view of Lafayette Cemetery . There he tells his story to a friend who has become a Catholic priest . But Lancelot 's confession is anything but repentant . It is both a funny and a scarifying jeremiad on the modern age . <P> Lunatics with apocalyptic visions can be wearisome . Thanks to Percy 's inventiveness and rapid pacing , Lancelot is not . In fact , he often sounds like a man playing out a symphony of Dostoyevskian experiences on a kazoo : " Did you know that the South and for all I know the entire U.S.A. is full of demonic women who , driven by as yet unnamed furies , are desperately restoring and preserving places , buildings ? " He tosses off witty remarks about the vacuities of Hollywood and about the strange things that occur when the film crew sets up in his town : " What was nutty was that the movie folk were trafficking in illusions in a real world but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the illusions "
