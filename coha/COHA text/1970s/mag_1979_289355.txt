Two national security cases underline an old dilemma <P> National security and the Bill of Rights , it seems , are almost naturally at odds . How can the Government plug leaks and stop the press from publishing its secrets without muzzling free speech ? How can it take any kind of national security case to court without spilling secrets at a fair and public trial ? The answer has often been that it can not . But last week the Government was back trying in two cases , one involving the Progressive magazine , and the other former FBI Acting Director L. Patrick Gray III . Both cases illustrate the difficulty of keeping secrets in an open society . <P> A fortnight ago , Government lawyers got a ten-day restraining order to stop the Progressive and its editor , Erwin Knoll , from publishing an article describing how an H-bomb is built . At a hearing scheduled for next week , they will argue for permanently prohibiting publication . The Government 's case appears strong : the article is accurate enough , say Government experts , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Atomic Energy Act specifically bans dissemination of secret information about atomic weapons . But if the Government wins , it will be the first time a U.S. court has stopped the press from printing an article because it risks injuring the national security . <P> That is so even though laws have been on the books since 1917 banning intentional disclosure of defense secrets that could harm the U.S. The laws are so broad and so murky that in theory they could be aimed at leakers and the press . In practice , however , they are used only on spies . Part of the reason is the First Amendment . But prosecuting leaks also runs a different risk : confirming that the leaked information is true , and disclosing even more secrets at a trial . This dilemma has vexed the Government for years in conventional espionage cases , but it drew little public attention . That is , until the Government began trying to prosecute its intelligence officials . <P> In the early and mid- ' 70s , a series of scandals rocked the intelligence establishment . The CIA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at home and abroad under the guise of national security . Out of congressional investigations came several indictments : Gray and two other FBI officials . Edward S. Miller and Mark Felt , were charged with conspiring to authorize illegal break-ins to track down members of the radical Weather Underground ; former CIA Director Richard Helms and a pair of ITT officials were charged with lying to a Senate subcommittee in 1973 about plotting to overthrow Chilean President Salvador Allende Gossens . But in late 1977 Helms was allowed to plead no contest to watered-down charges that he misled the Senate , and this winter the Justice Department simply dropped charges against the ITT officials . Now it appears that the FBI case is also in danger of aborting . Why ? National security . Lawyers for the accused insist that their clients can not get a fair trial unless sensitive Government secrets are brought out . Rather than disclose them in court , the Justice Department has been avoiding trial altogether .                   @ @
