" Textbooks are becoming obsolete ; things are happening so quickly . " So says Brian J. Brown , editor of the TIME Education Program , through which 130,000 high school and junior college students are using TIME in the classroom . In addition , their 5,000 teachers receive free each month a bundle of supplementary educational materials-pamphlets , charts and maps-designed to make social science and humanities curriculums as up to the minute as possible . <P> Each month 's packet of materials centers around a theme . " We play editorial roulette , " says Brown . " We try to anticipate what 's going to be hot . " Sometimes it is uncanny how hot the subject can be . A pamphlet entitled " U.S. Prisons : Schools for Crime " was published in September 1971 , just two weeks before the Attica revolt . Other timely topics have been impeachment and women 's liberation , as well as lighter subjects like " body language " and the Beatles ' lyrics . After describing a bloodless coup in Bolivia , one pamphlet suggested that students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were going to stage a coup of their own . <P> Several principals were less than enthusiastic about this game plan , although no successful student takeovers were reported . The supplementary materials prepared by Brown , Researcher Elizabeth Rudulph , and occasionally by TIME writers , are geared toward the teacher , but the pamphlets also contain selections designed to be duplicated and distributed to students as well . A year ago , Brown instituted Fragments , a magazine to which student subscribers contribute poetry , cartoons , and answers to questions like : " Do you agree with a University of Massachusetts professor that ' the grading system is the most destructive , demeaning and pointless thing in American education ' ? " ( Most students agreed heartily . ) <P> Brown , a graduate of St. Francis College in Loretto , Pa. , worked for newspapers , wrote political speeches and made television documentaries before coming to head the TIME Education Program in 1967 . He has also taught English literature at Purdue University and Hunter College . Brown further broadens his background-and rustles up ideas-by visiting students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kids today are just frightening in the extent of their awareness , " he says . " They 're pushing the teachers to talk about topics that were once taboo , like abortion and drugs . " <P> When a class orders ten or more TIME subscriptions ( at a 50% student discount ) , its teacher gets an extra copy plus the monthly selection of teaching aids .
