Ken Rosewall 's drinking is confined to an occasional glass of beer . Stan Smith 's most colorful expression is " Aw , shoot . " Rod Laver does not even smoke . The tennis world has , in fact , sorely lacked an outstanding male player with personality to match since the heyday of dashing , temperamental Pancho Gonzales . Now there is a promising candidate for Pancho 's old role . He is Breezy-Mannered Bachelor Bob Lutz , who last week became the first American in ten years to win the U.S. Professional Tennis Championship . <P> With his shag-style haircut and aquiline nose , 24-year-old Lutz looks like a cross between Actress Jane Fonda and former Baseball Swinger Ken ( " The Hawk " ) Harrelson . His hazel eyes are as adept at staring soulfully at a pretty girl across a crowded room as they are at following a speeding ball across a net . Then there is the Lutz smile , or smirk , that has helped make him the idol of tennis " groupies . " On court , he contends , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of constant expression that can get on an opponent 's nerves , especially if it is backed up by consistently strong strokes . For much of Lutz 's adult playing career , the smile has lacked that kind of support . But not in the pro title matches at the Longwood Cricket Club near Boston . <P> Displaying a devastating assortment of backhand shots , unseeded Lutz vanquished some formidable opponents . He knocked out top-seeded John Newcombe of Australia in the first round , scoring the final point in a tense tie breaker with typically audacious anticipation of a cross-court drive . " Fortune favors daring , " Lutz later explained . Lutz 's other victims , in order , were New Zealander Brian Fairlie , Aussie Laver , South African Cliff Drysdale and Dutchman Tom Okker . Okker was out-hustled in the final by Lutz , who earned $10,000 for his 6-4 , 2-6 , 6-4 , 6-4 triumph . <P> Lutz has been playing tennis since his ninth birthday , when his father gave him a junior-size racket , a certificate for twelve lessons and a pat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he won regional and national singles titles . Then he entered the University of Southern California and became best known as Stan Smith 's doubles partner . The pair won the national collegiate championships in 1967 and 1968 ; also in 1968 they took the U.S. Open and amateur titles and the first of three successive Davis Cup victories . Joining Texas Promoter Lamar Hunt 's pro troupe in 1971 , Lutz was no sudden sensation . In fact , before this month , he had won just one of the troupe 's tournaments . But his Longwood triumph seemed more of a weathervane than a fluke . At a time when some of the established stars appear to be slipping , Lutz seems to be on the climb-despite a loss in the first round of a Cleveland tournament later last week .
