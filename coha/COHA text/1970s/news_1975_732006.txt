txt Labor in Latin America has always been cheap and plentiful . In this capital city of three million people , for example , the minimum wage was raised recently to the equivalent of only $1.33 a day . Some estimates put the rate of unemployment and underemployment high as 30% . Yet a number of companies , including subsidiaries of some American-based multinational concerns , have turned to an even cheaper source of labor that is also strikeproof : Colombia 's prison inmates . In the past several years , prison production lines have been operated by units of Container Corp . of America , a part of Marcor Inc. ; B. F. Goodrich Co. , and others . Prison authorities say the practice is entirely legal . But it has been kept so quiet that even the secretary-general of Colombia 's largest labor federation says he had n't heard about it . Many Colombian and U.S. businessmen and officials also express surprise upon first hearing details of the prison labor projects , some of which started 10 years ago Currently Colombian prison authorities say , about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assembling carboard egg cartons to recycling bottle caps . They are paid , but far less than the average unskilled worker in regular factories , and they do n't get any fringe benefits , which typically amount to 70% to 100% of the cash payroll here . They also have to surrender 10% to 30% of their pay to prison authorities for " administrative expense . " Pew Prisoners Convicted Few of the prisoners working for private companies have been convicted . Rather , they are caught up in the Colombian system of justice , in which the accused usually stays in prison until tried or until he serves time equal to the term he would have received if tried and convicted . Since bail is practically nonexistent , about 75% of the inmates fall into this category . Some have been jailed eight to 10 years without a trial . Now there are plans afoot to turn the entire prison population into " employes " of national and multinational companies . This is a proposal of Action in Colombia , a nonprofit group backed financially by 70 large Colombian and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to local units of Bank of America , Dow Chemical Co. and International Business Machines Corp . So far , an Action official says , Colombian and U.S. businessmen have responded " very favorably " to the plan , which is put forward as a program for rehabilitation and improvement of the prisoners ' lot . But the plan bothers some people , especially when U.S.-based multinational companies are involved . " I suppose there are justifiable reasons for some firms to be involved in this , especially if there is some kind of training or rehabilitation going on , " one American official says . " But it 's one thing for Colombian companies to use Colombian prisoners and quite another for U.S. multinationals to take advantage of this . It could be labeled as exploitation of slave labor for a profit " Fernando Umana , who heads Colombia 's only public-interest law firm , adds , " It 's especially bad for the multinationals to do this in an underdeveloped country . " Prison officials say the program is voluntary , but some observers question the extent to which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One Leary Official Oscar A. Bradford , president of the Colombian-American Chamber of Commerce here , says he had n't heard of the practice , but says , " If I were a corporate executive , I 'd be inclined to look for something a little less controversial . God knows there are enough other areas of social reform in which to apply corporate efforts and resources . " There are n't any indications that any of the U.S. companies involved have ever trumpeted their " social rehabilitation " of Colombian prisoners to the stockholders back home . In fact , moat of the companies approached for this story insisted they wanted to maintain " a low profile , " as one official put it , , and were reluctant to talk . In the U.S. , the use of prison labor by private companies and individuals was outlawed early in this century . The ban followed gross abuses in the South , where wardens often pocketed money to put inmates to work on farms . It is also illegal to import into theU.S. goods that have been made by " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Colombia is " forced , " there is n't any evidence that goods made in Columbian prisons are coming into the U.S. now . In Colombia , Ramiro Carman , the director of prisons , thinks the only problem with private companies using prison labor is that there are n't enough of them . " We need professional businessmen who can tell us things about machinery , production and ? most important  --  organization , " Mr. Carranza says . ' " Many companies that need manual labor can benefit from this even if they are n't doing it for the socially right reasons , " he adds . A Visit to Prison A visit to the Villanueva Prison in Call , a city of one million located in a fertile valley in southwestern ' Colombia , shows the program in action . Off to one side of a long , narrow dirt courtyard , some 50 men are at work in a warehouse-type sructure , gluing and assembling egg cartons , for Carton de Colombia S.A. , which is 67% owned by Marcor'r Container Corp . of America . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
