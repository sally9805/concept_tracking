MY dear Abdullah , I am here , " read the message to the general in beleaguered Dacca . " The game is up . I suggest you give yourself up to me and I 'll look after you . " The author of that soothing appeal was India 's Major General Gandharv Nagra . The recipient was Lieut . General A.A.K. ( " Tiger " ) Niazi , commander of Pakistan 's 60,000 troops in East Bengal and a onetime college classmate of Nagra 's . Minutes before the expiration of India 's cease-fire demand , Niazi last week bowed to the inevitable . By United Nations radio , he informed the Indian command that he was prepared to surrender his army unconditionally . <P> Less than an hour later , Indian troops rode triumphantly into Dacca as Bengalis went delirious with joy . " It was liberation day , " cabled TIME Correspondent Dan Coggin . " Dacca exploded in an ecstasy of hard-won happiness . There was wild gunfire in the air , impromptu parades , hilarity and horn honking , and processions of jammed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red and gold flag of Bangladesh . Bengalis hugged and kissed Indian jawans , stuck marigolds in their gun barrels and showered them with garlands of jasmine . If ' Jai Bangla ! ' ( Victory to Bengal ! ) was screamed once , it was screamed a million times . Even Indian generals got involved . Nagra climbed on the hood of his Jeep and led the shouting of slogans for Bangladesh and its imprisoned leader , Sheik Mujibur Rahman . Brigadier General H.S. Kler lost his patches and almost his turban when the grateful crowd engulfed him . " <P> Late that afternoon as dusk was beginning to fall , General Niazi and Lieut . General Jagjit Singh Aurora , commander of India 's forces in the East , signed the formal surrender of the Pakistani army on the grassy lawn of Dacca 's Race Course . Niazi handed over his revolver to Aurora , and the two men shook hands . Then , as the Pakistani commander was driven away in a Jeep , Aurora was lifted onto the shoulders of the cheering crowd . <P> Thus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the wars between India and Pakistan* came to an end . The surrender also marked the end of the nine-month-old civil war between East and West Pakistan . Next day Pakistan 's President Agha Mohammed Yahya Khan reluctantly accepted India 's cease-fire on the western border . It was a complete and humiliating defeat . The war stripped Pakistan of more than half of its population and , with nearly one-third of its army in captivity , clearly established India 's military dominance of the subcontinent . <P> Considering the magnitude of the victory , New Delhi was surprisingly restrained in its reaction . Mostly , Indian leaders seemed pleased by the relative ease with which they had accomplished their goals-the establishment of Bangladesh and the prospect of an early return to their homeland of the 10 million Bengali refugees who were the cause of the war . In announcing the surrender to the Indian Parliament , Prime Minister Indira Gandhi declared : " Dacca is now the free capital of a free country . We hail the people of Bangladesh in their hour of triumph . All nations who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ milestone in man 's quest for liberty . "
