&gt;The Rt . Rev. John E. Mines , Presiding Bishop of the U.S. Episcopal Church , is a genial , soft-spoken man with a self-deprecating sense of humor . Hines recently startled a meeting of San Francisco priests when he called himself " the worst administrator of any Episcopal Presiding Bishop in history . " Last fortnight his fellow Episcopal bishops got a greater shock in the mail : a letter from Hines outlining his plan to retire as Presiding Bishop in the spring of 1974 , after the triennial general convention next fall can elect a successor . Hines is the first Presiding Bishop in the church 's history to quit early for reasons other than illness , but he may have good cause to step down . His years in office have been marked by factional dissension , especially over a " ' Special Program " which he proposed in 1967 . Adopted in a euphoria of enthusiasm for church involvement in social action , the program has since paid out some $6.5 million in grants for " minority group empowerment . " Some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radical for local Episcopalians . In some cases , congregations retaliated by cutting off contributions to the national church . Church financial receipts have since rebounded , but statistics of the Hines years reveal attrition in other areas . Membership has dropped from 3,616,000 in 1965 to 3,445,000 in 1971 ; church school enrollment is down 24% , confirmations are down 26% , infant baptisms 21% , adult baptisms 44% . Doubtless the statistics reflect the religious uncertainty of the times more than the administration of Bishop Hines . Nevertheless , explained Hines , he feels that the church would be " better served by a younger and more vigorous person . " <P> &gt;For several years now , the Presbyterian Church in the U.S. ( Southern Presbyterians ) has been rumbling with rumors and threats of schism . The mildly liberal majority of the 960,000-member denomination favor a merger with the United Presbyterian Church in the U.S.A. ( Northern Presbyterians ) , which would heal a breach reaching back to the Civil War . Conservatives among the Southern Presbyterians are not only opposed to the merger but also to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evangelism and to a proposed new confession of faith that they consider doctrinally vague . Up to now , the right-wing Southerners have been moving cautiously , but one group among them plans to take a bold step . This month as many as seven conservative congregations from the Presbyterian Church in the U.S. will join five independent Presbyterian congregations to organize a new " Vanguard Presbytery . " The hottest issue of the schism is likely to be property . Any group of believers can take a walk any time they want to , but they have had to leave their church property with the denomination . But courts in Georgia have recently allowed congregations to take their property with them , and now six of the seven defecting Southern Presbyterian congregations ( scattered from Virginia to Alabama ) , are trying to do just that by simply renouncing their ties with the national church . The 843-member West End Church of Hopewell , Va. , however , is going through channels and has petitioned its district presbytery " to dismiss us with our property . "    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
