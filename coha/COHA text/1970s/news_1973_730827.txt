txt " If there were a little more religion in this world , " Clarence Hammes said fiddling with a pair of keys , " my son would n't be dead today , " Hammes , 52 , sat beneath a cross in the kitchen of his South Side Milwaukee home , mourning the death of his son . Four hours earlier he had heard in a news broadcast over his car radio that his son David , 20 , a student at Concordia Teachers College in River Forest , and his roommate Robert Charles Erfourth , 23 , of Lincoln Park , Mich. had been found slain in their Maywood coach house apartment . " I HEARD THAT NEWS and I let out a stream , " Hammes said . " It 's the Lord 's doing and I 'm not bitter , but I just want to find out who did it and I want to take a look at him . " Dave was such a good guy ? he 'd give you the shirt off his back  --  they called he and Robert ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ college because they were always together . " I 've sort of been blaming myself for this because last September I lost my job and it 's hard for an older man to get a job , " Hammes said . " When I finally got one we 'd spent all our money and David had to take two jobs this summer to pay for his senior year . " BOTH DAVID and Hobert had wanted to become teachers and had worked part time as seemly guards at the school to achieve their goal . Hobert , who had graduated a month ago , was " just waiting to go overseas before this hap ' pened. " his **  --  old brother , William said yesterday . " He I wanted to go to Hong Hong Or Australia ? he was a person with a deep interest in the welfare of society . " He wanted to teach in a missionary Lutheran s c h o 01 overseas and he was working in Chicago to save the money and was waiting to hear if he . would be going , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the coach house at the Montessori school where ' they were getting free board in exchange for keeping up the I grounds and caring for a pet lamb ? " something they had I been joking about . " William said . " Our faith in God is the only thing that will carry us Unit this . " the elder Hammes said . motioning toward the family and friends gathered in the ing roam of their modern , onestory ranch style home . In the group was David 's mother . Margaret , and two of four other Hammes children .
