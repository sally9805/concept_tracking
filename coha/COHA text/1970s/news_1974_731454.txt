txt Maryland state police may be able to put an end to the sporadic looting , but Baltimore 's labor problems threaten to paralyze this financially distressed city of 905,700 . Garbage workers started a strike with a wildcat walkout two weeks ago after their leaders had accepted the standard city offer . Other workers and the police joined in later . Leaders for the various workers have resumed negotiations with city officials . These negotiations could lead to a temporary settlement and a return to work shortly ? at least by police . fit n.nt+hlii ' , however , those policemen working with their sergeants and officers in defiance of the union , along with a hard-pressed fire department beset by an unusually high number of vacant house fires ( many smoldering up from the stacks of uncollected refuse ) are reaching the end of their endurance . Vintinclaily , the city reached that point some years ago and has barely been hanging on since . Diminishing returns A month-long teacher strike effectively shut the schools in the spring .

The looting of liquor , grocery , and furniture stores In the hard-core areas and an upswing in vacant-house arson that petered out with the dawn was the extent of the disorders . Mayor Schaefer , meunwhile , must find fiscal help from either the state or the surrounding , virtually all-white middle-class counties , an unlikely prospect at best . To add to the city 's woes , its de facto segregated school system is under federal orders to desegregate ? a move bitterly resisted by the middle-class whites who remain . The city already has enacted its budget , set the property tax rate , and sent out the tax bills all predicted on a 6 percent settlement .
