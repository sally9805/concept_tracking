Montreal loses a daily <P> Managing Editor Ray Heard walked into the paper 's newsroom one afternoon last week and delivered the brutal message : after 110 years of business , the Montreal Star ( circ. 114,000 ) had published its last edition . The evening daily had lost $14.6 million and 50,000 readers as the result of a bitter eight-month pressmen 's strike that ended in February . So the owner , F.P. Publications ( the Toronto Globe and Mail and six other Canadian dailies ) , decided that with the balance sheet red and the broadsheet unread , the Star was better off dead . <P> Long the fat matron of Montreal 's once powerful English-speaking minority , the Star consistently outsold its morning rival , the Gazette ( circ. 168,000 ) , which was founded in 1778 and is owned by the Southam chain ( the Ottawa Citizen and 13 other Canadian dailies ) . But over the past two decades , Toronto has gradually displaced Montreal as the nation 's leading city . English-speaking Montrealers began moving out in even larger numbers after Ren @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1976 . For a while , the Star weathered that exodus well . But during the strike , circulation at the newly lively Gazette soared to roughly what the Star 's had been before the dispute . By the time the Star resumed publication , its readership had plummeted to the Gazette 's old level . ( The French-language La Presse circ. 175,000 also fattened from the strike . ) Said Star Publisher Art Wood after last week 's announcement : " The simple truth is that Montreal could no longer support two independent English-language dailies like the Star and the Gazette , and the people of Montreal chose the Gazette .
