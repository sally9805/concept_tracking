Is pregnancy one more medical disability for which employees should be compensated ? No , said the Supreme Court last week by a vote of 6 to 3 . At issue was a California law that provides payments for private employees who are temporarily disabled but excepts those with disabilities attributable to normal pregnancy . Speaking for the majority , Justice Potter Stewart found no evidence that California 's treatment of pregnant women violated the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment . Concerned with the costs of increasing disability coverage , he wrote : " Nothing requires the state to create a more comprehensive social insurance program than it already has . " <P> Justice William Brennan saw just such a requirement . In his dissenting opinion , he accused California of creating " a double standard for disability compensation " by excluding " a gender-linked disability peculiar to women " while conferring full benefits for such classic male disabilities as prostatectomies and circumcision . The economic effects of pregnancy , wrote Brennan , are " functionally indistinguishable from the effects caused by any other disability . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a clear case of sex discrimination .
