txt THE HEALTH and Hospitals Governing Commission , which runs County Hospital , has been locked in frequent disputes with the Cook County Board since the Commission was created by the Illinois General Assembly eight years ago . The latest fight concerns the commission 's 1978 budget , which was set by the county board . The commission contends it is too small and will require enormous cutbacks and much reorganization . The commission has announced that it is laying off 570 employes but says the quality of hospital care will not be significantly affected . Dr. James G. Haughton is executive director of the commission and , according to county board members , dominates the nine-member governing commission . One county commissioner has called for his resignation . The following is an edited transcript // Houghton defends cuts at County Hospital // of an interview with the controversial Houghton . Q ? Dr. Ifaughton , why Is It necessary to lay off 570 persons to stay within the 1978 budget of $177 million ? The 1978 budget is $7.2 million higher than the one in 1977 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about $170 million in 1977 . But this did not include some $4 million in contractual increases that had not been paid . So by the time the county board approved the 1978 budget in late February , we were already into spending , with inflation , $175 million . You can add to this another $4 million or so caused by new union contracts that must be paid by the end of the year . Remember , we have nine union organizations , all of whose contracts were negotiated before the county board adopted the budget . So , to come back down to anywhere near what we have , we had to reduce the level of expenditures that had already occurred by the time the budget was passed . And if we are going to meet those other contractual increases , we are going to have to pare other millions . The $177 million was $18 million less than we requested , and the increase was only about 41/2 per cent over last year . Q ? Was n't that increase in keeping with the consumer price index ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which went up 15 per cent . Q ? Is it true that you can make these cuts without disturbing medical services to the poor ? A ? That 's not quite correct . We are able to make these cuts without discontinuing services to people . But the services will suffer ; there is no way around it . The notion that health services can function without a strong administration is an improper one . People will wait longer . Medical records may not get to where they are . going as rapidly as they should . We are going to try to make sure that when people do get service from a doctor , nurse , or technician , the service is good . But timeliness is a part of quality , and these reductions are going to have an impact on timeliness . Q ? Does n't it follow mat many of these 570 employes were excess baggage ? A ? I was afraid somebody would say that . People impose disruptions , and then when you try to respond effectively they say , " See , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ win . The fact is that the county board has been talking about top-heavy administration for seven years , and we 've cut and reorganized and pruned , and no organization has that much fat . We are cutting blood and bone and muscle now . Our administrative costs are only about 31/2 per cent of our budget . One county commissioner charged that there are bricklayers on the payroll who  --  have n't laid a brick in years , &; That 's not true : In fact , we . have a smaller staff  --  even without the layoffs ? than we inherited from the , county . The people we have are kept ** you have a building this old , there is always something that has to be done . Q ? The Civic . Federation , a taxpayers watchdog group , has analyzed your budget and soya that salaries are 30 to , 90 per cent higher than are paid to persons in compakable positions in similar . hospitals . What is your response ? A ? That 's nonsense . The federation looks at our budget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theyvpick out titles and compare them with titles in other organizations .. The only Way to compare two jobs is to look at them . Titles do n't tell you anything . For example , it compared our director of purchasing with a hospital purchasing director in the federal government . The purchasing director at a federal h o s p it al writes requisitions against things that someone in the General Services Administration buys . My purchasing director actually buys ? $30 million worth of goods and services every year . , Q ? In this age of taxpayer griping , how do you react to criticism of your salary ? At $81,600 a year , you are the highest-paid public , official in Illinois . A ? I do n't ' believe that it is too high , compared wills what I could earn doing other things . You do n't get a job done , . by underpaying people to do it . And you , do n't decide that my salary is too high by comparing it with thb salaries of people who ? are underpaid . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give me discounts because I am a public employe . Q ? Your ' critics say you live in a grand fashion , being driven about by a chauffeur and wearing $400 suits . A ? Who wears $400 suits ? I do n't . But if I did , so'what ? I work hard for my money  --  about 18 hours a day . As to the chauffeur ? my auto is an extension of my office . I work in it . Oak Forest Hospital ( also governed by the commission is 35 miles away , and I work on the way there and back . My chauffeur is a security officer , because of threats I have received But when I am not mobile , be does n't just sit and wait ? he is pulling a beat like other security officers . Q ? Do you favor a law that would make the governing commission independent of the county board ? A ? Yes . This was first proposed last December by George Dunne . At that time he noted that the commission was created to provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , ' I do n't see why we need politics at all . ' In view of the statement , we started drafting such a proposal . It 's now in the hands of our legislative committee . And although no firm decisions have been reached , we believe that a new law should provide the commission with the power to determine its own levy . We have talked about the possibility of adding five members to the commission , bringing membership to 14 . We are not unaware of the need for accountability , especially in an organization that has taxing authority . And so one option being considered is to have public officials , perhaps elected officials from the city , county , and state levels , as commissioners . I am optimistic that some sort of legislation will be introduced at the next session of the legislature . Q ? What about legislation that would place the institutions under control of the University of Illinois ? A ? Well , it has been my observation that the U. of I. has problems just running its own hospital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who are pro- , ; posing this are talking about turning the " entire financial burden over to the state , and I doubt that this would be very popular with anyone south of Joliet.
