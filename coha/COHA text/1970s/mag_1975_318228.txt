COMMEMORATIONS by HANS HERLIN <P> Translated by ERIC MOSBACHER <P> 293 pages . St. Martin 's Press . $8.95 . <P> <P> When Hans Berlin , 49 , resigned as managing editor of Molden , one of Germany 's largest publishing houses , he wanted to write a novel about Nazi skeletons in the national closet . With questionable taste , he also hoped to make it " entertaining . " The result is this slick , ambiguous thriller . Hans Pikola , 50-year-old world-weary photographer turned hit man , stalks the even more world-weary war criminal , Karl Boettcher . The motive , revealed through flashbacks , provides romantic interest , undertones of incest-plus a gloss of social commentary in the form of industrial conspiracy in a Krupp-like organization . Result : a first novel that is already a bestseller in Germany . <P> Commemorations is a much better book than it has any right to be . Almost despite himself , Herlin has managed to create an indelible cast of minor characters . Among the dozen subtly etched survivors are Pikola 's estranged wife Thea , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ singer who ever appeared on stage to entertain German troops , " and the narrator 's father Ludwig , who earned his living during the war by printing postcards of soldiers who had won the Iron Cross . All the characters are revealed as victims , afflicted by memories of what they suffered or what they inflicted . But there is one more victim of this curious book : the author himself . Berlin 's " entertaining " plot is a kind of strategy for evading the very horrors he has resurrected . The price for that evasion is the Commemorations that is , instead of the major novel that might have been . <P> <P> TERMS OF ENDEARMENT <P> by LARRY McMURTRY 410 pages . Simon &; Schuster. $9.95 . <P> <P> Houston-based Aurora Greenway , 49 , is a transplanted New Englander and an AstroTurf widow . On the rebound from 24 years of marriage to the pallid Rudyard ( " A plant could not have been easier to relate to , or less exciting " ) , Aurora gaily assembles and mistreats a colorful retinue of suitors including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oil millionaire who lives in his white Lincoln . She views their constant proposals of marriage skeptically . " Men have never distinguished themselves for sexual fidelity , " she says . " The poor things have short attention spans . " <P> Although Aurora 's polished dialogue is not without wit , she never sounds much better than the star of a road-company Importance of Being Earnest . As he has demonstrated in novels like The Last Picture Show , Author McMurtry feels most at home with Texas natives , and the odd characters who orbit around his highfalutin heroine regularly upstage her . In the book 's best scene , for example , a jealous and not-too-bright husband tries to find his wife at the J-Bar Korral by driving through it in a truck . Aurora 's plain , long-suffering daughter is as poignant as her mother is flashy , and her grim fate at the novel 's end seems out of keeping with all the earlier slapstick . Yet McMurtry 's skill and compassion all but hide his incongruities . <P> <P> MORTAL STAKES by ROBERT B. PARKER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
