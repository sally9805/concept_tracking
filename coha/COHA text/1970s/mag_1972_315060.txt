Next week is " French Week " in Jerusalem . Its goal is to improve Franco-Israeli relations , which disintegrated after Charles de Gaulle branded Israel an aggressor five years ago and refused to deliver 50 Mirage jets that Israel had already paid for . <P> The path to cordiality is proving thorny . Israel took umbrage when France , in the midst of the planning for French Week , joined Arab and Communist countries in voting for a U.N . Commission on Human Rights resolution that referred to Israeli " war crimes . " The Israelis also demurred when Paris decided to send a political old-timer-Assembly Member Louis Joxe , an ex-Justice Minister-instead of a current Cabinet Minister to next week 's dedication of a maison de France at the Hebrew University . <P> The final insult was France 's refusal to send official representation to the opening of a display of Paris city planning at Jerusalem 's new $2,500,000 municipal theater . Jerusalem Mayor Teddy Kollek will preside , and the Quai d'Orsay felt that sending a delegation would compromise the French position that Jerusalem is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Israelis , a compromise was worked out . Jean Cherioux , president of the municipal council of Paris and thus its unofficial mayor , will attend the theater ceremonies as the city 's representative . Afterward , he , Kollek and other guests will attend a Comdie Franaise performance of Marivaux 's Les Fausses Confidences , which revolves around misunderstandings between lovers .
