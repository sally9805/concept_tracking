Doroteo Arango , who had most of his life as Francisco Villa , was assassinated on . July 20 , 1923 , in the town of Hidalgo del Parral , Mexico . He was forty-five years old . Although he was unable to write and he could not read without saying the words aloud , he had won two revolutions and lost a great civil war . The only invasion of the continental United States in the twentieth century was made by troops under his command . The details of Villa 's life have been obscured by fable or calumny ; depending upon the politics of the writer , Villa is either a drunken bandit or a drunken hero . His Mexican admirers make a Spanish gentleman of him ; a. liritish historian recently announced that Villa was a mulatto ; Hollywood made him into Wallace Beery . He is almost always described as boisterous , foulmouthed , and stupid . In reality , Villa was a teetotaler . He rarely smoked . He so distrusted militarism that he wore his uniform only on great occasions , preferring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a shirt without a collar . His grins were saved for photographers ; he was mystical , Indian , moody , bemused by the complexities of power and politics , married to paranoia by the conditions of his life . One senses the man lingering in the country , a sorrowful ghost , the last great rebel in a line that began with Cuauhtemoc , the defender of Tenochtitlan . Hidalgo del Parral , Chihuahua O N COOL DAYS the campesinos and the old people who come to the center of Hidalgo del Parral sit on the benches in the plaza in front of the cathedral . If they have money , they eat ices saturated with artificial flavoring or roasted ears of corn or ? 42 In E a sticks of pastry made of gnarls of sugar glaze . If they have no money , they sit there nevertheless , pretending that they are neither hungry nor thirsty ; they are careful not to look at those who have the money to comfort themselves with sweets . The etiquette of country poverty is a plan for maintaining one 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to lie away the world and be human in spite of it , the wisdom of pretense . The poorest therefore do not beg and those who have failed most in the worldly accounting have the most to say about how to live . The hero of the plaza and the subEarl Shorris , a contributing editor of Harper 's , is writing a novel based on the tile of Nacho Villa . jcct of much of the conversation is Gen. Francisco Villa . Those who remember him argue about the place where his car stopped ; was it the tree that is now marked with a plaque and ringed with cement or was it ten or fifteen yards up the street ? " I remember . " " I stayed here in the Hotel Fuentes when he was the owner . " " He was light-skinned . " " He was red . " " I saw the troops marching through . " " But I knew the Casas woman ; she told me everything . " " My father and I tried to save Contreras , who had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " There is also agreement : on the morning of July 20 , 1923 , Villa 's closest companions picked him up at the house of a woman named Casas , by whom he had a six-year-old son . They drove past the Plaza Juarez and made a right turn . A vendor , standing in the plaza , shouted " Viva Villa ? " to identify him to a group of assassins who waited in a one-story white house just around the corner . Each of the eight or nine men in the house fired at least a dozen shots into the 1915 Dodge touring car . Villa was shot through the head and chest . His body and the bodies of the men who died with him were carried to a hotel room , where the body of Villa was stripped down to its undershorts and put on display . Photographs of the mutilated body were published as evidence of his death . The assassins escaped , running up the street to a corral where their horses were waiting , saddled and loaded with provisions and water . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , no connection between the government and the lunatic who claimed responsibility for the assassination was ever proved . Three years after his death , Villa 's grave was opened and his head was stolen . It has never been recovered . In many Indian cultures it is said that a dismembered body does not rest in peace . Of course , that is not an acceptable reason for the stealing of Villa 's head , even to the philosophers who come from the mountains to sit in the plaza in front of the cathedral . " I do n't believe this , " one of them said , leaning close and whispering , " but the campesinos say that Villa had a compact with el chantrico ? the devil . " Chihuahua , Chihuahua UZ CORRAL , widow of Villa , LA walks on bent legs , supporting herself with a stick . She is old and wide , a caretaker of disputed glories . Her tomb has been prepared , a dank room with earthen walls beneath a small shrine . When she is dead , the headless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be buried together in the Park of the Revolution . Doha Luz will be the only one of Villa 's five wives to he so honored . She has won him by her tenacity , living out these fifty years since his death on nothing more than the proceeds of his memory . She has made a museum of the last and grandest of Villa 's houses in Chihuahua . Tourists may buy Tarahumara dolls or Navaho bracelets from the showcases near the patio ; a niece will summon Dona Luz to pose for photographs ; the automobile in which Villa was riding when lie was assassinated is displayed in a glass case . The white walls of the patio mirror the sun . Before noon the heat begins to invade the display rooms , the dust smolders in the plush chairs , the leather holsters anticipate another crack , the stocks of the Mausers and Winchesters dry , the photographs fade another day . Across the patio in a smaller room a woman combs the long black hair of a small girl . Bees work among the flowers . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ main house there is au-other courtyard and a honeycomb of apartments in which the relatives of Dona Luz have hung out the wash and turned to cooking . A slight young girl , brown and barefoot , dressed in THE CIRCLE OF REVOLUTION a rose-colored slip , crosses the courtyard carrying a pan of water . The sun casts its silence over the house . Dofia Luz sits in her easy chair beside an old wooden desk and reads the newspaper . She collects donations from the tourists and unlocks the glass doors of the bookcases to sell them books about Pancho Villa . Shc has written no books about him . They knew each other so little . Luz Corral , his blondie , sewed curtains for the headquarters car of his train and married him in a church . There were other women , other wives , but it was the revolution that was his home ; he danced best and dreamed deepest before he went into battle . How well she knew him , how much he spoke to her , can not be known . He lived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life ; he knew horses , bulls , fighting cocks , the intricacies of mountains . What could he have said to a wife in the slow evening before bed ? Lesser men took their women with them to those wars , bedded them beside the railroad tracks and ate the tortillas they cooked over tiny fires on the tops of boxcars . Villa 's railroad car was a meeting place for generals . Dona Luz tells the revolution from a textbook written by a Villista , without detail , making his life as lean as a myth . The bibliophile of Chihuahua stands in his store , which is filled with popular books and hidden mementos of the revolution , and disputes whatever she tells . The guns she displays were not Villa 's , he says ; she sells them and replaces them with others from the same epoch . The car she displays is the fourth 1915 Dodge that has been in the glass case . And the knife ? he smiles and shrugs ? well . Villa did not carry a knife . His clerk sits behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and remembers the time when he saw a mution-picture photographer following Villa out of the city hall . The clerk chews gum and blows pink bubbles . He nods agreement at the calumniation of the widow of Pancho Villa ? as if it mattered , as if history were not invention . The walls that Villa built here in Chihuahua are unmarked , the beef that he butchered was as perishable as the people who ate it . On the hack of the stone marker that celebrates the founding of the city in 1708 there is now a hurriedly stenciled portrait of Che Guevara . Pancho Villa is dead . His soldiers will no longer run the powerhouse or tend to the sanitation problems of the city of Chihuahua . They are spraying kerosene on the mesquite in the great fields north of the city ; when the mesquite dies there will be grass for grazing and then the fields of figs and peaches will come . Chihuahua is a state of forests , mines , and great ranches now becoming farms . The Terrazas and Creel holdings against which Villa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belong to the same families . The descendants of Don Luis Terrazas have no need to make museums or invent history ; they can devote themselves to the killing of mesquite and the marketing of figs . Fur the Tarahumaras , the gentle Indians of the high mountains and incredible canyons , there has been even less change . When they are children , they sing and play their game of soccer with a bone-crushingly heavy ball , they run like no one else in the Americas , and then they settle into the same deprivaton they have always known , remaining too proud to learn Spanish , too proud to beg , too hungry to avoid the city . They walk down to Chihuahua from the mountains , make their trades , inspect the plaza , and return to the mountains . They did not fight with Villa ; they had nothing , they have nothing ; Catholic missionaries defend them from the mestizos and starvation ; no one defends them from the missionaries . They are the wounded innocents , these men in white cotton and women in heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adorning their thick black hair . They live by myths and die at the whim of the city or the mountain . When Villa first came to Chihuahua he was almost as innocent as a Tarahumara , but the abuse of his innocence produced rage instead of meekness ; he had become a bandit . After years in the mountains , he came down to Chihuahua to work in a mine , trying again the life of other men of his class . When his foot had been crushed in an accident and he could no longer work , he sold his saddle and his rifle to pay a doctor who abandoned him when the money ran out . Another doctor offered to amputate the leg , but Villa gave himself instead into the care of two old Indian women who cured him with roots and herbs . He worked again , fled to the mountains when he heard that the federal rural police were coming for him , lived again as a bandit , and then again returned to town , the last time as a butcher and seller of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was Villa the owner of a butcher shop who was taken to see Don Abraham Gonzales , a Freemason and political reformer and the first literate man with whom Villa had ever conversed . Historians say that Villa became a revolutionary during that meeting . It is unlikely ; he was more than thirty years old , he had been to the mines and the fields and the prisons of Mexico under Diaz . It is more likely that Villa , the revolutionary without a program , went to the house of Gonzales and accepted the first plan he had ever heard . For Villa there was flattery in the meeting and there was also a connection between the atavistic dream that was born with him and the possibility that had finally been spelled out for him in the written world . It was not a miraculous conversion ; Villa knew of the killing of striking miners ; he had seen the life of the peon and the campesino ; his father had died when he was seven years old , if that man was his father ; and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the henequen plantations of Yucatan and the hellish tobacco fields of Central Mexico . All of the classic conditions for revolution existed ; he took the first hope and went to war . Later , he carried the bones of the murdered Don Abraham through the city . His beloved artilleryman , General Felipe Angeles , Villa 's choice for president of Mexico , died there too , executed by a firing squad . Chihuahua is a rich town , promising in the contrast of the rich and the people who live and hunger in the unstuccoed adobe houses , good ground for revolution . There is talk again of revolution here , but it is confined mainly to the students . In the cantinas , the men drink at the bar and cross the room to urinate in the trough along the opposite wall . Mariachis play ; the markets are filled with fruit , corn , and meat , while the poor sit outside the shady and sweet-smelling sheds and squat on the broken sidewalk to share a pot of corn gruel . Great trucks bring onions , melons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and even the stink of their diesel engines can not obscure the earthy romance . Burros and horses come too , drawing tiny wagons on bald rubber tires stolen from abandoned cars : they are like ancient singing in the morning streets ; poverty can be the charm of another time floating by in parade . At evening , the contrasts fade , the television programs cover all . In the rows of broken houses , the doors are open , the lights are dim ; there is an empty quart of beer , a plastic table , a torn couch , curtains separating a bedroom and stove , the blue light of television . A breeze stirs the dust , an old woman scolds a dusty child , and then at the same instant laughter comes from every house in the city of Chihuahua . It is after the revolution . Canutillo , Durango FIE R.A.ncu MLST have been a I kind of paradise in the late summer after the rains had come , for then that part of Durango turns green and the little river that separates Canutillo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottom , feeding the fruit trees and gardens of the Hacienda de Canutillo . The summer is not hot at that altitude ; the cattle grow fat and the meat is juicy , corn as its adolescence and wheat is born , beans and chick-peas grow , the grass is sweet , and no gardeners are needed to make the flowers bloom . When Villa no longer believed in war , he accepted the ranch as a settlement from the government and came here to see what he could make of peace . He had been to Las Nieves and Canutillo before ; once to see to the execution of his old friend Tomas Urbina , who had stolen money belonging to the revolution . When he settled here in 1920 , it was to build a model farm for himself and his doradas . He rebuilt the church and the great house , and constructed long rows of apartments for his people . For his entertainment he built a handball court , and for his politics he built a school and started a bank that offered low-cost loans to those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hank . Photographs taken at Canutillo show Villa fattening like a steer in summer , supervising the granary , watching the children at his school , and walking behind a plow . Here he studied the campaigns of Napoleon and the geography of Mexico . He ordered tractors from the United States and lie tried to read Dante . Guests came to dinners presided over by Austreberta Renteria , his newest wife . There was peace , comfort , and pursuit of reflective delights . There were harvests , dances , and children singing . A provincial elegance was being formed ; cigar smoke mingled with fruit blossoms in the gardens . Now it is all a ruin . Pigs root in the broken rooms of the great house , the church is padlocked , the garden that was beyond the stables is overgrown , chaotic . The trees that shaded the front of the house have been chopped down for firewood , garbage that has been picked over by the pigs lies on the hard ground where his famous horse , Siete Leguas ( Seven Leagues ) , was stabled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sun-baked clay and straw become dust . An old man stands in the street that leads up from the river to the hacienda . The houses that line the street are crumbling , the store is rich with flies and empty Pepsi-Cola bottles . " Villa was a big man , " he says , " well reddened by the sun . He was very serious , a man of great temerity . This was his land . And here on this street , these were all the houses of his generals , the escort of Pancho Villa . " The house of a curandero IIIHERE ARE TWO FAMOUS eurari- deros ( healers , medicine men ) in this part of the Sierra Madre Occidental ; one is an ancient Indian who lives in the mountains in a nearly inaccessible place ; the other is his disciple , known as the curandero of the spirit of Pancho Villa . They practice three kinds of medicine ; herbalism , cures through the use of psychedelic drugs , and spiritualism . The herbs they use are those that can be found in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are peyote , jimson weed , and the root of gold ( raiz de aro. ) ; and the spiritualism involves Catholicism and communication with the ( lead . The Spanish-speaking curanderos of Mexico are victims of a broken culture . They lack the art and elegance of Navaho or Huichol med- THE CIRCLE OF REVOLUTION walls are bare , the floor is hard dirt , the door is raised a foot above the level of the ground , distrustful of the rains . The curandero leads me to a small room attached to the hark of the house . It is like an airless box , four feet wide , eight feet long , and five feet high . There are no windows . The only source of light is an electric light bulb fixed to the wall above the chair in which the curandero sits . Beside him is an altar made of stucco , pale green , like the walls and the ceiling . Framed pictures in a photographically unreal style decorate the altar . A benign , pastel Jesus looks out at the patient . Crucifixes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On the wail to the left of the coranderu is a photograph of Pancho Villa leading a cavalry troop . Behind the chair in which the patient sits is a portrait of Villa and a small Mexican flag . The curandero and his patient face each other across the narrowness of the room , each in his wooden chair with a caved-in upholstered seat . The lower part of the carandero 's chair is draped with unbleached cotton cloth that reaches to the floor ; the patient 's chair is unsteady , the rungs have lost their paint , the wood is gray . We smoke , filling the room with the palest blue . He wears sunglasses , he smiles ; his undershirt shifts , revealing the fragility of his yellowing old man 's skin ; his teeth are staggers of brown and yellow , his hands are thick and bending , the fingernails are funereal . The smoke stings . The curandero begins the litany of the life of Pancho Villa with the birth of Doroteo Arango at La Cuyotada . An ordered , accurate history emerges , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long-known truths are told , formally , in rhythms of certainty and sanctification . But the verification of the powers of Pancho Villa is not for me . I have conic for information : What kind of roan was he ? ! ) id you know him ? Did he dream ? Did he laugh ? I know his history , I seek his character . A moment cracked , a system trembled , he breathed and rubbed his dying thigh . " Pancho Villa was a very serious man . He did not drink or smoke or use bad language . He used the root to learn that his spirit was a small bird . " 6 " What nat root ? Peyote ? " " Peyote is not a root . He used the root of gold ( raiz de oro ) to see ( ver ) . " " To see what ? Visions ? To see as in dreams ? " " No . To see . " " The future ? " " No . To see . When a man uses this raiz de oro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he wakes up and he sees clearly . " We looked at each other blankly . There is no Spanish word for insight . " How do you know he used this root ? " " Because of the spirit of the small bird , " he said , and then he began again to tell the history of Villa . While he spoke , I concentrated on his face and his words . In the periphery of the field of vision of my right eye a small black bird appeared . The curandero seemed to know , for he changed the direction of his speech ; the history eased over into the mystical experience . " You can speak to Pancho Villa . His is the greatest power . Well , the greatest power after the power of Our Lord . He will speak through you , the power of him will be in you . " The bird was there , as real as the room , still ; hlack , larger than a crow . I saw its head , its eye , the gleam and the crackling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been entered by the spirit of Pancho Villa , there could be no doubt about it . The picture over my head was a symbol of the position of Villa , he would speak through me . The old man spoke , too . He had removed the sunglasses , his blind crooked eye was turned up in my direction , raised above the cataract , looking at me . " Villa 's spirit will come through you . He will speak from your mouth . it will be expensive . The spirit of Pancho Villa must be paid . Do you have money ? " " Yes , yes , how much ? " " He will tell you . " Everything I saw was true , yet I could not believe it , as I do not truly believe that airplanes fly above the clouds or that men have walked on the moon . We negotiated . We talked of art and insight and the spirit of Pancho Villa . I insisted upon consciousness , he spoke of the world beyond knowing . I watched his crooked eye and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the deerskin bags hung heavy with secrets , the pastel-colored photograph of Villa on Siete Leguas achieved dimension . The bird was gone . The opportunity had disappeared . How had I allowed it to escape me ? The eye stared , the man spoke , but I thought only of the spirit of Pancho Villa . Major men do not have such failures . Literature belongs to the quick . Other failures passed between my eyes and the eye of the curandero : novels written too soon , essays written too late , summer girls of adolescence lost in a phrase . The blind eye was now unbearable ; I could sense the texture of the cataract , the inevitability with which it crawled across his eye . And what was his illness ? He coughed , his face was damp ; typhoid had been reported in northern Mexico . " We are good Catholics , " he said . " We believe in God . God permits man to eat whatever is on this earth . It is not a sin to use peyote or raiz de oro . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one I had heard from peyolists in South Dakota , Montana , California , and Arizona . I was the bored victim of my own skepticism , having learned too late that credulity is a virtue of heroes . Villa , Villa , Villa , what he might have said ; the photograph was smiling as if the bird was now saved from revealing its secrets to me . Stingy fool ! If only I had agreed to pay . The gods of Mexico are insatiable . This one wanted only money ; Huitzilopochtli would have asked for the flesh of my heart . My eyes fell , I could not hear , I watched the feet of the curandero , the toes as tough as hooves , the skin the color of the servant of the sun . Behind the feet the cloth moved . And there was the bird , the spirit of Pancho Villa , caged in cloth beneath an old man 's chair . I gave the curandero a handful of pesos and went away laughing , knowing again that myth is either there or it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than smoke .

We leave this world as we came into it , with nothing . True ? " When she thinks about Pancho Villa , she asks , " Why did the Americans help him ? " " L or the oil . Diaz was giving the contracts to the English and the Rockefellers wanted them . " " So the Americans did help Villa ! But they helped Carranza more . " " Yes , yes , in the end the Americans defeated Villa ; they would not allow him to buy ammunition in America and they allowed Carranza to move his troops from one part of the border to another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why ?

" The government is worse now than before the revolution , " she says . " Then the people should do something about it . " " The people are lazy now , too lazy to fight the government . " " Perhaps not . " " We are too poor . " " How can anyone be too poor to want justice ? " " It can not be explained on this short ride to La Capital .

Doroteo Arango was born here , just outside the town in a place called El Coyote . He came into a mean and grueling life , the son of a doomed sharecropper , destined for peonage ; he even carried a name that belonged more to a woman than a man . His hopes were groundless , his courage was foolishness ; there is no motivation for his strength ; he can not have been a man of his own making mysticism and machismo do not challenge the order of the universe ; he was the dream of his time ; the child of the old woman behind the walls who thinks in her sleep of the golden age of her own youth .

It is difficult to understand how he escaped . The walls of the room in which he was imprisoned are fifteen feet high and made of thick adobe . There is one window near the ceiling , and it is small and barred . The jailer and the sheriff use that room for an office now . They have hung Mauser rifles and branding irons on the wall , souvenirs of the time of Villa , It is a casual jail , as it must have been in Villa 's time ; the main gate is held by a dime-store padlock and an iron bolt that is worked from the inside .

" During the revolution , " he says , " Villa used to come to my grandmother 's house to eat . She liked him ; he was quiet and respectful . But she said he was a strange guest ; he carried his own eating utensils in the breast pocket of his coat and he refused to eat with any others . " Villa , his grandmother , the revolution ; they fill him with sighs . He inflates his fat brown cheeks and blows out resignation .

After two years , they were starving . Then the rich came to them and told then , they would buy the land back for a few pesos , whatever they deigned to pay . The people had to sell .
