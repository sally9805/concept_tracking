THE TALK OF THE TOVN Notes and Comment WE have received a letter from a friend home in bed with a cold : This bed is a real mess  --  mountains of Kleenex , mountains of newspapers . You might say that on an extremely small scale I am fighting for survival , striving to keep from sneezing my precious life away , but between seizures I glance at the papers  --  especially at stories about Cosmos 954 , the Soviet nuclear-reactor satellite that blew a gasket and finally came to rest in the icy reaches of the Canadian north , spreading radioactive contamination over miles and miles  --  and I wonder if it is worthwhile to shake this cold . I mean , I 'll get over the cold , with aspirin , fluids , bed rest , and the holding of many beautiful thoughts , but I am gripped by the fact that the Soviet Union has at least ten nuclear-powered orbs dancing through our skies and that the United States has nine . The newspapers are rather cozy about the matter , some stories saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the orbs to reenter the earth 's atmosphere , and only adding sotto voce that even then the enriched uranium would he extremely radioactive . Another story says there 's nothing to worry about for four hundred years . And another joyously speaks of four thousand years of grace . But are n't all these figures  --  six hundred , four hundred , four thousand  --  mere blinks in the long history of the human race ? If so , I 'm wondering who gave any body permission , either orally or in writing , to tamper with the existence of Man , much less set a theoretical cutoff date for worldwide contamination . One of the few things that have sustained me , through happy years and through sad ones , has been the thought that somewhere , sometime , a vigorous , intelligent , progressive , decent , perhaps freckled **45;5800;TOOLONG would put his or her shoulder to the wheel and roll the heavy stone one inch farther up the hill . Have to stop now . Aspirin time . ? ? Screened AVERSSEN , the owner of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the professional Eastern Basketball Association , takes pride in knowing his personnel . When Mr. Verssen contemplates the players on his team , he likes to say that they are " a very screened group of individuals . " In a way , the same could he said of the fans who come to watch the Dodgers play their home games  --  at Roosevelt Hall , a gymnasium building on the campus of Brooklyn College . In fact , Mr. Verssen , a rotund , bespectacled man in his fifties too short to play competitive basketball but just the right size to own a team  --  himself screens all the individuals who attend the games . He does this while taking tickets at the door . Mr. Verssen recognizes that he is a rara avis among professional-sports moguls . He is his own factotum . " I 'm the guy whose job it is to worry about everything , " he told us one recent Sunday night as he guarded the gate prior to a contest between the Dodgers and the Providence Shooting Stars . Several people got in without paying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's part hut , rather , because he is generous . If someone sidles up to the ticket table and hesitates in an odd way , Mr. Verssen asks in a low voice , " You a friend of anyone ? " In many instances , the fan mentions the name of one of the Dodgers , and the owner admits the friend free of charge . This makes the Brooklyn Dodgers one of the few professional sports organizations around that are run with the coy ambience of a speakeasy . Usually , a couple of hundred paying spectators attend the games . Once , when the Dodgers played the Washington Metros , the gym was loaded to capacity  --  with seven hundred and fifty people . For that occasion , the Dodgers had distributed free tickets in Flathush and Canarsie . The lack of a critical mass deprives the Dodgers of basketball 's proverbial home-court advantage . As it is , the team owner would n't really mind if the Dodgers played all their games on the road , since this would obviate renting the Brooklyn College gymnasium . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out-of-town trips . Last month , however , when the Dodgers flew to Alaska to play the Anchorage Northern Knights  --  the Anchorage team picked up the tab  --  he had to stay behind in New York , because of various other obligations . By day , he teaches mathematics at Monsignor McClancy Memorial High School , in East Ehnhurst . Also , he owns a printing business in Greenpoint . He regrets not making the Alaska journey , even though doing so would have forced him to witness two consecutive losses by the Dodgers. " they were fairly close games , but we still lost them both , " he told us . " I think we ran into some jet-lag problems . " The Dodgers ' roster for the game against Providence listed twelve players , seven of whom actually appeared in uniform . A couple of non-roster players also suited up . Wondering which of his players will or wo n't attend a given game leads Al Verssen to conclude that owning a minor-league basketball team " can place a person in a stressful situation . " In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lists Harold Tonick as head coach and Mr. Verssen as defensive coach . The myriad demands of sole ownership , however , have restricted the time that Mr. Verssen can devote to coaching defense , and he now relies upon Mr. Tonick to handle both jobs . In any event , defense is not an integral part of the game in the Eastern Basketball Association . Not long ago , for example , the Dodgers vanquished the Quincy Chiefs by 169-167 ( no overtime ) . " This is second-chance heaven , " Mr. Tonick told us as we made our way to the sideline with him and Mr. Verssen to watch the Dodgers and the Shooting Stars limber up for the game . " The best players here , the younger ones , have tried without success to make it in the big league , the National Basketball Association , and now they are waiting for a second chance . Some of the others might he a little alder . They realize they 've taken a step down , but they like to play and they need the chance to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some talented and promising players . Jim Bostic , a forward , leads the E.B.A. in rebounds and in scoring . Jackie Dorsey , who while playing for Brooklyn is actually under contract to the Denver Nuggets , of the N.B.A. , leads the E.B.A. in shooting percentage . Mr. Verssen , fur his part , probably leads the league in pained expressions . We noticed as the Dodgers took the floor during the pregame warmup that the team members wore green jackets inscribed " Pros . " These were left over from last season , before the Dodgers were called the Dodgers . We also noticed that one of the Dodgers ' forwards , a former member of the New York Knicks named Ronnie Nunn , wore white shorts , while all his teammates had on green . Harris Parker , the team 's general manager , noticed it , too . " Any chance we can get all these guys in the same kind of shorts ? " he asked . Mr. Verssen ignored the question . Mr. Parker muttered , " We got ta get uniforms in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seven-thirty , but no one seemed to he in a hurry . For one thing , when seven-thirty rolled around , Jackie Dorsey , the star , had not arrived . " Sn where the hell is Dorsey ? " Mr. Verssen asked . " Do n't look at me , " said Mr. Parker . " Last week , he flew in from Atlanta for the last six minutes of our game against the Metros , " Mr. Verssen told us . " He almost pulled it out for us , too . Scored six points . " A few minutes later , a head attached to a six-font-tight-inch body appeared in the doorway . This was Jackie Dorsey . He greeted the owner , the coach , and the general manager and then went off to the dressing room to change . Meanwhile , the public-address announcer , a Brooklyn College student named Ira Klein , had begun the proceedings . " Good evening , and welcome to Roosevelt Hall , home of the Brooklyn Dodgers , " he intoned . " For those of you who are attending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of you who have been here before , you 're here again . " While Mr. Verssen continued to keep an eye nut for prospective ticket buyers , we took a seat in the bleachers , in front of a middle-aged man who was telling his two teen-aged sons , " Yeah , I went to school with Dave DeBusschere . Sure . Do I know him ? Of course I know him . Ve used to play one-on-one together . In fact , a couple of moves he 's got I taught him . " The game began , and after a few missed shots by both teams Providence took the lead on a jump shot by a guard named Erie Ferange . We looked up his name on our program . Although Ferange was listed as six feet two inches tall , he looked as if he could do a much more convincing imitation of someone five feet ten . Within seconds , Brooklyn evened the score , and once Jackie Dorsey had entered the game , about five minutes after it began , the Dodgers seized control and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew it would happen like this , " said Mr. Parker , who had taken a seat next to us . " The Providence team may wear uniforms that match , but we play better . We 'll blow these guys off the court . " At halftime , Brooklyn led , 67-45 . During the intermission , we saw Vinnie Ernst , the Providence coach , standing outside the gym eating a doughnut and drinking coffee . " What 's your strategy for the second half ? " we asked . " Two choices , " he said . " We 're gon na either send seven men onto the court or lock the Dodgers ' dressing-room door . If the whistle blows to begin the second half and they are n't here to play , we win by forfeit . " In the second half , the Dodgers came onto the court on schedule but they had some shaky moments . Most of these , however , were offset by some shaky moments that the Shooting Stars had , and Brooklyn held on to win , 130-113 . Jackie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Afterward , we sought out Mr. Verssen . Victory , we had assumed , would give him a chance to smile , but he had other matters on his mind . For one thing , the players had to he paid . He declined to tell us what the paid attendance had been for the game . " You know , there are two and a half million people living in Brooklyn , " he said . " I figure we should get at least a thousand of them here for each game  --  that 's the break-even point  --  but so far we have n't done it . I might add that no matter whom I talk to  --  politicians , businessmen , people who live in the borough I always get good vibes . No-body is disdainful of the Brooklyn Dodgers . I want you to know that I 'm doing this in the best interests of basketball and the best interests of Brooklyn . " Mulatni AGOOD gypsy violinist , we dis- covered last week , has skills vein , much like those of a good bartender @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Gy6rgy Lakatos , smiling , rather roly-poly thirty-threeyear-old Hungarian with dark , curls hair , who will be performing ever ) , night in midtown Manhattan for tin next six months or so , and who is considered by many music lovers in Hungary to be one of that country 's three or four top gypsy violinists  --  which saying quite a lot , because in grease Budapest alone there are a hundred ant eighty gypsy bands and orchestras play . ing the hotels , restaurants , coffeehouses and taverns every night of the year The good violinist can , like the goo ( bartender , parallel his guests ' moods adjust their feelings , throw light or their problems , or , at least , apply oint ment to their wounds . The bartende does this by listening to you or ignor ing you , by telling you a joke or buy ing you a drink on the house , and tin gypsy violinist also figures out the inns " Y ou 'll be surprised at how little gas it actually guzzles. " ? effective way to get to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resonant , deep , slow tones , or dazzling arpeggios and trills . Lakatos and four sidemen , all of whom are also in their earl ) thirties  --  a clarinettist , a cirnbalom player , a violist , and a double-bass player , which is the traditional configuration of a gypsy band  --  are now the house musicians at Hungaria , a cheerful and comfortable below-ground-level restaurant in the newly opened shopping mail in the Citicorp Center , at Third Avenue and Fifty-fourth . They 're the first imported Hungarian gypsy hand ever In play an extended engagement in the Stales . Vile were able to make our discovery about Lakatos 's method of operation because at Hungaria you can watch the musicians and the barkeep at the same time : one side of the bar extends to within a few feet of the handstand . This seems a friendly gesture , for it means that , despite the fact that Hungaria offers a Hungarian menu not based on goulash ( you 're asked to make do with dishes like bridal soup with fresh vegetables and Snail eggs , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and despite the contention of some scholarly Hungarians that gypsy music is an indispensable and indivisible part of dinner , you do n't have to eat at Hungaria in order to catch the music . Lakatos appears relaxed when he works , and he and his hand pay a lot of attention to one another and to their audience . They play a mixture of traditional gypsy songs , with names like " Fly , My Little Swallow , " " 1 Do Not Owe Anybody Anything , " and " The Left Leg of My Dog Is Aching ; " nineteenth-century encores from the classical repertory , like the MCditation from " Thais ; " and modern pop songs , like " Moscow Nights . " This mixture is in itself traditional ; gypsy music has always been magpie music , adopting what it likes at all times as well as offering what it has to others  --  Haydn , Mozart , Brahms , Liszt , and Schubert all show gypsy influences in their own work . What distinguishes the Lakatos band is that its members , like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ training , and they play a warm but controlled chamber-music style of gypsy music , which has something of the clarity of Lotte Lehmann singing Schubert without losing any of her vocal power . Lakatos can play an audience like a violin , and his music can certainly do anything that drugs or alcohol ever could . By the time the band took a break , after forty-five minutes , it seemed to us that there was more sparkle in the glasses on the tables , more color in the richly embroidered vests the hand was wearing . We felt ready for anything . We mentioned this to a man at a nearby table who had been eating hugely and listening raptly . He said that he was Hungarian and that we were now ready to he Hungarian , too . He explained that nitilohli , the Hungarian verb for " having a good time , " contains the two ideas of passive enjoyment and active participation , and he said that he had seen gypsy music have the same effect on Americans who had never heard it before , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that they listened to nothing but Gregorian chant and rock , and on older Hungarians , most of whom long ago adopted one gypsy song or another as their own personal song28 FEBRUARY 13 , 19 7 8 almost a signature tune . The Hungarian went on , " My opinion is that listening to some of the wailing , slow gypsy pieces will make you live longer , by slowing you down and thus extending your life span , while the fast pieces accelerate your sense of time passing , so that you feel life burning faster during every moment of your now extended lifetime . " A few minutes later , we were talking with the band  --  seven people packed into an alcove off the bar . The seventh person was our interpreter , for after a few weeks in the States the band 's English is limited to " How do you do ? " and " Bye-bye . " Our interpreter was George Lang , the Hungarian-born New York restaurateur who is the author of the encyclopedic cookbook " The Cuisine of Hungary " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and who designed Hungaria and hired the band , after auditioning twenty other gypsy bands in Budapest , and then spent a year and a half negotiating with various authorities , including the Hungarian government and the American Federation of Musicians , for the necessary permissions for the band to work in New York . We asked Lakatos if gypsy music extended people 's lives , and he laughed , took a sip at a bottle of beer , lit a cigarette , and said that he was more interested in the present moment . " By its very nature , gypsy music is either sad or happy , " he said . " What I do is look at an audience to see who is sad and who is happy , and then try to level out the mood , so that everyone will laugh and cry alternately . " The other members of the band smiled and nodded , and George Lang said that this was always the Hungarian experience , because Hungarians cryingly have a good time and laugh when things are bad . All the musicians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hack as anyone can remember . ( Gypsy music is still an all-male business ; there was one famous woman gypsy pr ; mas , or bandleader and solo violinist , who lived two hundred years ago , hot so far no one has followed her example . ) The clarinettist , Sandnr Kecsk6s , who at home is a soloist on Hungarian radio or television almost every week , started playing the instrument very late , at sixteen ; before that , he was interested only in water polo , a game that Hungarians take seriously and play better than anyone else . He uses an East German clarinet , he told us , because he thinks that Willi Bauer , of Leipzig , is the best clarinet-maker in the world . Oszkair Marisa , the cimbalom player ( the cimbalom is a type of dulcimer , descended from the medieval Persian psaltery and played with mallets , like a vibraphone ) , did n't want to be a musician when he was a kid  --  until he heard Istvan Lukics , who played only in gypsy orchestras , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then Morzsa had to learn the instrument . Once he had mastered the cimbalom , he was hired by the Hungarian State Folk Music and Dance Ensemble and played with it for twelve years . He likes to play jazz and Chopin on the cimbalom as well as gypsy music . Lajos SarkOzi , the violist , whose father was a well-known pr ; nitis , started out on the violin but switched over to the viola when he found that he reacted much more strongly to chords and rhythm than to melody . The viola rarely plays a solo in gypsy music , the double bass never . Sindor Kuti , the double-bass player , comes from a family of double-bass players . Lakatos , whose father was also a famous primal , started playing the violin when he was four and his brother Vince Lakatos , now himself a prirrills , was six . " My brother had just been formally enrolled to study the violin , and I used to take his violin and play on it and with it , and break it , so they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I have been practicing ever since , so I ought to he pretty good . " At the age of nine , GyOrgy Laka-tos was admitted to the Barra Insti-tute , the Budapest equivalent of New York 's High School of Music and Art . He was one of nine violinists ac-cepted that year out of twelve hun-dred who auditioned . After graduat-ing , at the age of fifteen , he started playing in a gypsy orchestra and tak-ing private lessons with Professor DersO Rados , one of the most fa-mous violin teachers of the time in Hungary . As Lakatos talked about Rados , it came out that George Lang , who is himself a good violinist , had also studied with Rados , so the two men traded Rados stories . Rados made his ckbut before he was twenty , and re-ceived disastrous re-views . The reviewers agreed that he had no tone , no intonation , no talent . He went into a deep depression , locked himself away for years , and studied everything there was to know about the violin : the psychology of violin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the arm muscles moved . Then he gave another concert , and got even worse re-views . But he knew THE NEW YORKER more about how to play the violin than anyone else in the country , so he became an extraordinary violin teacher ; he was so good that anyone who had studied his method for a certain length of time could always pick up a violin and know that he would he at least a decent player . Both Lakatos and Lang remembered their awe of Rados . At each lesson , he would demand , glaring at the pupil , " How is the tone today : How is the sound sense ? " and he taught that every phrase has its own tone and its own sound sense . " He had a hawklike nose and a chin that pointed upward , " Lang said , " and he gave each lesson in such a spiritual mood that he could make an Indian guru look like a frivolous character from the sixties . " For thirty years , Rados and Professor Le6 Weiner , the most famous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dorati , Eugene Ormandy , Fritz Reiner , Sir Georg So16 , Janos Starker , and Joseph Sziged , played chess every afternoon in front of the same window of the Caf ? Abhazia , in Budapest . Weiner , who always lost , always ended the game by saying , " Well , tomorrow I 'll show you . " In New York , Lakatos likes to drop into jazz clubs after work . ( The hand starts playing at Hungaria at six-thirty and knocks off at eleven-thirty . ) He is a voracious reader , of everything from Shakespeare to Agatha Christie ( in Hungarian , of course ) , and a big sports fan . He 's hoping he 'll run into George Beckenbauer , the German soccer star of the Cosmos , with whom he got to he good friends when his band played an engagement in Munich . Meanwhile , he is drawing enthusiastic audiences at Hungana . The other evening , the violinist Ruggiero Ricci stopped in and , after listening , with mounting excitement , to Lakatos playing a gypsy fantasy for him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paganini 's Twenty-fourth Caprice . ? APosTscraPT about The Market , which is the name of the new Citicorp Center shopping mall , and which occupies three levels of a low-rise building attached to the fifty-nine-story office tower . The center of the mall is a ninety-eight-foot-high atrium filled with tables and chairs and with ficus trees in planters , served by speedy escalators , and surmounted by a skylight . The main tenant of the mall is Conran 's , the housewares store , and most of the other tenants are restaurants and food stores . In addition to Hun- ? garia , there 's an English restaurant called Richoux of London , which is open twenty-four hours a day , features Scotch salmon flown in from London , and has waitresses in black uniforms and white aprons and caps , who look like the waitresses in the better Pall Mall clubs , only slightly younger ; and there 's an oyster-and-clam bar , a Swiss restaurant , a Greek restaurant , a health-food restaurant , a chocolate shop , a French bakery that sells rain au chocolat and coffee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ atrium , and a pltiterie-caf ? , called Small Pleasures , that sells cakes and tortes baked in Hungaria 's kitchen and also open sandwiches , ice cream , espresso , and soft drinks . There 's a branch of Doubleday which features cookbooks , and there will soon he a branch of Alfredo the Original of Rome ( Alfredo calls himself the pasta king ) , a coffeehouse named Slotnick 's Daughter which also sells coffees and teas , a Scandinavian caE , offering herring in mustard sauce and aquavit , and a French restaurant serving rotisserie-style leg of lamb , not to mention fish and pig 's feet . The whole area is brightly lighted by a mixture of sodium-vapor and mercury-vapor lamps which looks a lot like sunlight ; it has a nice , clean , sleek , restrained modern look , and it is pleasant in winter to eat a rain au chocolat at a table in the atrium and look straight up at snow falling silently on a skylight ninety-eight feet overhead . ? There is one thing about The Market which could puzzle New Yorkers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that his company had envisioned the Citicorp Center as " perhaps a symbol of this changing New York  --  a New New York that can solve its problems and set new standards of urban achievement . " New Yorkers who are familiar with 399 Park Avenue , the Citibank building in the Hock adjacent to Citicorp ( 399 , which is nothing much to look at , is just north of the Seagram Building , and , although it was built a few years after the Seagram Building , looks ten years older , having ignored the lessons that the Seagram Building had to offer ) , will probably only be pleased by the whole Citicorp complex : The Market , the triangle-topped , aluminum-covered-steel office tower , and the new polygonal St. Peter 's Lutheran Church . But that " New New York . " Hmm . Then we got it . Nationally , the enclosed shopping mall started out as a cleaned-up taste of New York occupying a small part of the downtown areas of other cities  --  the first one went up in Rochester , New York , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off limits , has lots of gaudy shopping malls , complete with atria , and one hotel with cocktail pods ( tiny lounges suspended over water ) . And now Manhattan , for the first time , has its own taste of New York , but entirely surrounded by New York .
