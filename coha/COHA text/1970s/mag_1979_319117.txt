A COMEDIAN DIES by Simon Brett Scribners ; 160 pages ; $7.95 <P> There have been lawyer-detectives and priest-detectives and even jockey-detectives , but perhaps the most intriguing blend of workaday occupation and avocational sleuthing is Charles Paris , an invention of English Writer Simon Brett . Charles is an actor-detective , perhaps the first and last of his breed . Performers are generally too self-absorbed to be much use in searching other people 's motives . <P> It may be that Charles is so hooked on ratiocination because he is so bad at acting . On the funny side of 50 , Charles is the kind of thespian whose career has been confined to small parts in the big time and big parts in the small time . When he needs a disguise , Charles usually borrows a look or an accent from one of his flops , and Brett wickedly runs in a quote from one of his provincial reviews ( " Had I not known it to be a good play , this production would not have convinced me of its merit " ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one . There is a wife he has not lived with in years , and the odd one-night stands with preoccupied actresses ; but Paris ' routine is as hollow as Philip Marlowe 's : the dismal bedsitter , the bottle of whisky , the nagging creditors . What distinguishes his adventures , of which A Comedian Dies is the fifth , is the author 's wry observations of Britain 's entertainment milieu . Brett has a farceur 's eye for crooked agents and egomaniac stars , for performers elbowing their way up or trying to take the slide back down gracefully , for network nitwits , for creative geniuses unsung by anyone but themselves . <P> In his latest case , Charles , on a reconciliatory week at the seaside with his estranged wife , is present at a variety show when a stand-up comedian literally turns into a live wire : a booby-trapped guitar electrocutes him when he grabs a microphone in the other hand . The hunt for the killer gives Brett a chance to do those set pieces that distinguish his books , notably one in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a deftly counterpunching old comic ( who is an admirably wise and well-developed character ) and another satirizing those ghastly award shows that blight English telly as depressingly as they do our own . <P> The juiced comedian turns out to have been a nasty little sod , so there are plenty of interesting people with good reason to do him ill . As usual , Charles , who can never keep a good deduction to himself , wrongly accuses several people of the crime . This makes good fun , since doggedness rather than courage is his forte . <P> It is Brett 's insider 's knowledge of high-intensity show business - he is a scriptwriter and former BBC radio producer - that makes his witty mysteries go . It looks as if Charles Paris is finally working in a long run . So it 's not Oedipus Rex . <P> It 's honest work and , for the reader , solid entertainment . <P> - Richard Schickel
