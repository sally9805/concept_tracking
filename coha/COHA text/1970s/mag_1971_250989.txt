In the photographs that survive from his last years , Piet Mondrian 's own head began to verge on geometrical abstraction . The domed skull had its remaining hair brushed flat , each strand meticulously parallel to its neighbor ; the two neat creases on the pale forehead ; the paired circles of his spectacle frames , and the thin mouth joined with utmost precision to his beak of a nose by two engraved lines . It was the face of no compromise-austere and possessed by a forbidding moral rectitude . No artist ever looked more like his own work . <P> Mondrian was one of the great lawgivers of modern art . He was born just short of 100 years ago , at Utrecht in 1872 ; he died in New York in 1944 . To mark his centenary , the Guggenheim Museum has assembled a retrospective which later goes to Bern 's Kunstmuseum in Switzerland . The show is a reminder of what " high seriousness " -a quality notably absent from most recent art-can mean in the hands of a master . <P> Mondrian 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been so huge that it tends , if anything , to obscure his own work . He is the father of asymmetrical design , and his progeny are legion . Bastard Mondrians , with their printed grids of black lines and their rectangles of primary blue , red and yellow , turned up on every flat surface that industry made-from tea towels to Courrges dresses , from cigarette packs to apartment faades . <P> Blocks and Dabs . Art needs stamina to survive that kind of diffusion . Mondrian survived triumphantly , though at some cost . The characteristics of industrial reproduction-flatness , harshness , gloss and repetition-became wrongly linked to his work . The idea that Mondrian was a kind of machine painter , all sensuousness barred , is one of the many illusions that the Guggenheim 's exhibition will dispel . <P> The son of a strict Calvinist schoolteacher , Mondrian began his art studies in Holland . In the Guggenheim show , we first meet him around 1890 , painting talented but not remarkable brown Netherlands landscapes and still lifes . Though Mondrian came to detest nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ windmills gave him a set of predilections about form which survived through his career-immeasurably refined and philosophized . <P> The blocks and dabs of red and blue pigment that pulsate across the surface of an early figurative Mondrian like Church at Zoutelande ( 1909-10 ) , record the same reflective delight in the rhythm and energy of particles that he must have felt when painting his last , unfinished canvas , Victory Boogie-Woogie ( 1943-44 ) . The ethical and mystical concerns that underlie Mondrian 's abstracts had become apparent earlier still in such paintings as Passion Flower ( 1901 ) . This Art Nouveau-flavored image had a curiously mundane origin : Mondrian suspected that his model had VD , and painted her face contorted into a St. Teresa-like trance of meditation and repentance.
