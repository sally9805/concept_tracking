txt A " comprehensive energy " program is unlikely until after the 1976 elections . And before Christmas " we'r ? ' going to have people out of jobs " because cit the natural gas-shortage . So runs the assessment of Frank Zarb. th ( nation 's top energy official . Congress , Mr. Zarb told reporters at a breakfast meeting here , recessed without taking steps to alleviate the natural gas shortage . now expected to be " 30 percent greater than the nation endured last year " The immediate need , says the White House . is emergency legislation allowing interstate pipeline companies to buy natural gas at free market prices over a 180-day period to forestall the closing of many factories in the Northeast , Mid-Atlantic , and parts of the Midwest . Natural gas produced and sold entirely within a state costs about $1.50 a thousand cubic feet . Gas moving across state lines is held to 52 cents a thousand cubic feet , by the Federal Power Commission . One result during the cold months ahead . according to Mr. Zarb , will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ S plants , 3.4 million businesses , and more than 40 million homes . Bills introduced to ease this winter 's shortage have become snarled in continuing disagreement over long-term deregulation of natural gas prices . The result is that interstate pipeline companies now lack authority to buy extra gas at market prices . Speaking more broadly , Mr. Zarb , head of the Federal Energy Administration , said there is a " better than even chance we will not // *Zarb asks Prwarganny gas lea " // get Congress to focus on the tough energy issues until after the 1976 election . " This svPssment , said Mr. Zarb , came to him from a number of senators and congressmen . Chief among the " tough issues , " he added , is the future price of oil . , President Ford , meanwhile , told a small group of reporters Tuesday ( Oct. 14 ) at the White House that " in all likelihood " he would veto any congressional tax cut not linked to an equivalent reduction in federal spending . Mr. Ford 's proposal for a $28-billion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $28-billion cut in federal spending for fiscal -- 1977 , faces bitter opposition from the Democrat-controlled Congress . Stressing his " strong personal feeling " about his tax and budget proposals , the President said the tax cuts " would give middle-class taxpayers " a break " they have long deserved . " He finds the " American public very disturbed about federal spending . " It was " opportune " that Congress should be home now " to get this impression " from voters . The Office of Management and Budget ( OMB ) , headed by James T. Lynn , is asking each Cabinet officer " to use his own initiative to come up with budgetary cuts . " Until the OMB results are in , said President Ford , he will not " specify " where budget cuts should be made , though " they would not necessarily involve substantial reductions in social programs . " Some limits to increases might be needed , said Mr. Ford , which would reduce the rate at which social security and other programs now rise automatically . The President also would " remove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " erode " the security of the United States , Mr. Ford sees " some areas in the Defense Department where better management would produce economies . " Mr. Zarb , speaking of the natural gas shortage , cited with approval a bill pending in the Senate , sponsored by Sens . Lloyd Bentsen ( D ) of Texas and James B. Pearson ( R ) of Kansas . This bill , among other things , would grant 180-day authority for interstate pipeline companies short of gas to buy fuel in the intrastate market , and would provide for immediate decontrol of all new natural gas from onshore wells . This last provision , its sponsors hope , would encourage producers to bring more natural gas onstream , in the knowledge they could sell it freely at market prices .
