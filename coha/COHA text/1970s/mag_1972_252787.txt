THE INNOCENTS <P> by MARGERY SHARP 1 83 pages . Little , Brown . $5.95 . <P> <P> Innocent here is a gentle , archaic term for a retarded child . Antoinette Guthrie , aged three , is the daughter of a beautiful English woman and a wealthy American . She is confided to the care of an aging friend in East Anglia while her parents travel on the Continent . World War II interrupts the tour , and the parents must return directly to America , leaving their daughter in England for the duration . After the war , the mother , who has become a New York society figure , returns to England to reclaim her child . <P> Such is only the shell of this wonderful , disarmingly fluty novel , which is Margery Sharp 's 27th book . Antoinette 's foster mother , who tells the story , speaks what at first seems a dithering Dame Margaret Rutherford prose : " As Sir David and I had agreed , summer was wearing on , and after summer one must expect autumn . " Yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the retarded child , whose still , strange presence dominates her life - until the mother returns with blithe hopes and confident of " cur ing " the innocent by psychotherapy . <P> But the child 's only fascination is her foster mother 's garden , with its ambience of witchery , herbs , bullock's-eyes , dead frogs , dog droppings . Sharp is too intelligent to make explicit any metaphorical claims . But her solution , as the society mother is about to take her natural child back to Manhattan 's concrete canyons , is a beautifully delicate stroke of paganism .
