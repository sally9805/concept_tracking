Those dread words New Hampshire are surfacing in the political columns again . Already . In the hot sun , long before the winter snows , Columnist Robert Novak of the team of Evans and Novak has been following George Bush around the state , busy making less ( " It is doubtful he was seen by more than 100 registered Republican voters " ) sound like more ( " . . . could set the foundation for an upset transforming Republican politics in 1980 " ) . <P> A tone of heavy journalistic irony usually suffuses such coverage , as if the reporter , by suggesting that Bush 's dozen trips to New Hampshire so far this year may be a little excessive , hopes to avoid drawing attention to the fact that the reporter 's own early presence on the scene is also much ado about nothing . Paradoxically , the presidential politicking season lengthens while voter interest declines . Much of the old gusto for hitting the campaign trail-which candidates sometimes had to feign and political junkies in the press corps sometimes had to suppress-has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ David S. Broder , the Washington Post 's veteran political writer , wo n't be drawn into it until after Labor Day , convinced that " the process has got out of hand in length and cost . " He thinks the press itself may have " aided and abetted " this overemphasis , because " it 's easier to cover politics than to write about government . " Theodore H. White , who first trooped around New Hampshire with Estes Kefauver back in 1956 , vows to make 1980 his last book-length inquiry into President making . " Why , New Hampshire 's only 26,000 votes ! " Teddy White says . ' ' It 's like analyzing the Harvard graduating class ! It 's only terribly important because of what TV does to it . " <P> Before next February , millions of words will be devoted to how each candidate is thought to be faring in New Hampshire ; after the election , more thousands of words will explain the results . It will be pointed out that New Hampshire is singular for having no urban crises , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be counted first . Even such analysis ( always project ahead ! ) will center on how New Hampshire 's vote may affect the next states to ballot . <P> Journalistic previewing constantly diminishes an event , boring the reader before it happens , making an election either an unsurprising confirmation of what was foretold or else an exercise in judging whether a candidate has done as well " as expected . " This can be unfair , as it was to Senator Edmund Muskie in New Hampshire in 1972 . Long before the primaries , a Boston Globe poll prematurely " gave " Muskie 65% of the vote ; on election day , though Muskie beat George McGovern , 46% to 37% , the press proclaimed McGovern the real winner . <P> A surprising portion of any publication is devoted not so much to what happened as to what presumably is about to . And not just in politics . Us magazine , a celebrity-watching fortnightly from the owners of the New York Times , promises " stories and pictures of what 's going to be happening during the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
