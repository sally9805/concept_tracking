THE 12-YEAR REICH : A SOCIAL HISTORY OF NAZI GERMANY , 1933-1945 by Richard Grunberger. 535 pages . Holt , Rinehart &; Winston . $10 . <P> In The Course of German History , Britain 's A.J.P. Taylor advanced the debatable argument that Germany has always carried with it a special kind of doom , and that the horrors of Third Reich totalitarianism were utterly consistent with the nation 's past . Now , in The 12-Year Reich , Richard Grunberger draws a chilling corollary : Hitler 's accession in 1933 , he contends , wrought no sudden or serious changes in the daily life and social institutions of Germany . Most Germans took to the swastika as naturally as they would to a new hiking path in the Schwarzwald . <P> Grunberger , a Vienna-born historian raised and educated in England , is author of two previous books on Nazism : Germany 1918-1945 and Hitler 's SS . In The 12-Year Reich , he employs a variety of sources to assemble a riveting portrait of the skillful Nazi corruption of an already rotting society . Grunberger even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the jokes that a few dared whisper about Hitler , perhaps the most revelatory of him , and of the Germans , has the Fhrer in a fishing boat with British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain and Mussolini . Chamberlain puts out a line , patiently lights a pipe , and within two hours has landed a respectable catch . Mussolini jumps into the water and grabs a fat pike . Hitler orders the pond drained . As the fish flop about helplessly on the bottom , Chamberlain asks Hitler : " Why do n't you scoop them up ? " Hitler replies : " They have to beg me first . " <P> The book is a mosaic of fascinating vignettes , both ghastly and ridiculous . Railway workers were allowed to abandon the otherwise mandatory Heil Hitler arm salute because it was mistaken for a signal and caused accidents . Goethe 's favorite oak tree near Weimar became the central point around which the Buchenwald extermination camp was built . In one village , a neighbor told a mother that the name of her missing soldier son had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russians . Far from being grateful , the mother thereupon denounced her well-meaning informant to the authorities for listening to Radio Moscow , which had broadcast the list . <P> Grunberger thinks that the pre-Hitler Weimar Republic applied the merest veneer of democracy over what remained basically an authoritarian state . Thus the mass of Germans easily accepted dictatorship . Within a year after Hitler became Chancellor , the birth rate , which is normally a sure index of public confidence , rose by 22% . Crime dropped off noticeably after 1933 . War preparations and economic recovery did away with joblessness . Living standards improved under the peacetime Third Reich ; food shortages did not become severe until 1943 , the fourth year of the war .
