txt Controller Harrison J. Goldin charged yesterday . that " misleading " information from the staff of his predecessor , Abraham D. Beame , had led him to believe that long-standing discrepancies in the city 's bank balances had been resolved before he took office . " They knew about the discrepancy , " he said , " but we did n't know about it . " It was the first such personal accusation in the continuing controversy over audit reports that Mr. Goldin had made public , depicting sloppy corfditions in the Controller 's office under Mr. Beame ? who became the Mayor on the same day that Mr. Goldin became Controller  --  and it drew a prompt counterattack from a mayoral spokesman . 2d Audit Involved " Controller Goldin was not misled intentionally or unintentionally , " the spokesman said . He . went on to charge that Mr. Goldin had known about the bank-account problems despite his assertions that they had come as a surprise to him . The new squabble involves the second of three outside audits commissioned by Mr. Goldin , The auditors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beame moved into City Hall and Mr. Goldin into the Controller 's office , the banks that do business with the city had listed $45-million more to the city 's credit than was reflected in the city 's own records , Various documents that have become available paint an ambiguous picture of who knew what , and when . But from the two sides , which had maintained a gingerly politeness until yesterday , came direct accusations . Even while the rhetoric has remained polite , the political implications have been considerable . Mr. Goldin has won massive favorable attention in an office that anyone rarely notices , and Mr. Beame 's longtime reputation for fiscal expertise has suffered . Letter Is Cited Yesterday , Mr. Goldin told Interviewers that a representative of his , Steven Clifford , had been told by Mr. Beanie 's staff that the bank accounts , which everyone familiar with the office knew had been more or less out of balance for decades , had been " reconciled . " The reconciliation had been affected by taking the final disparity discovered by the Beame ' , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late in 1973 as a separate reserve fund . But , Mr. Goldin was asked , had not Beame assistants told Mr. Clifford how the reconciliation was effected ? " Absolutely not " Mr. Goldin replied . He made available a letter dated Dec. 14 from James D. Carroll , who was Mr. Beame 's first deputy , which said flatly : This office has completed a reconciliation of the City ' Treasury as of June 30 , 1973 . " Presumably the file containing that letter would have spelled out in detail how it had been done . But Mr. Goldin said that the verbal assurances to his representative that there had been a reconciliation had persuaded , him that he need not examine that file immediately . " I did not have to regard the problem as a priority matter because I had been led to believe there was a reconciliation , " he said . When the audit first came out last week , a spoksman for Mr. Goldin said that Mr. Beanie had never told the Controller about the discrepancy , leaving the impression , therefore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a friend of Mr. Beanie 's made available a document to support the belief that Mr. Goldin had known indeed . It was the report on the Controller 's office by the State Charter Study Commission ? written coincidentally by the same Mr. Clifford who had helped handle the Beame-toGoldin transition for Mr. Goldin . That report was not made public until February , but it had been circulating for months before that . The Beame friend showed a photostatic copy of page 43 , with the following sentence underlined : " Although the Controller 's books balance to the penny each year , the fact that they can not be reconciled to the cash in the bank strongly indicates that they are in error . " Mr. Clifford , who still works for the Charter Commission but who was reported on vacation and unavailable yesterday , also wrote a transition study , which the Fund for the City of New York made available to Mr. Goldin . Its report on the bank balance situation could be interpreted in varying ways . But whatever Mr. Clifford wrote , Mr. Goldin said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had done about the reconciliation and they told him that they had effected a reconciliation and there were no problems . " " Looking at it as charitably as possible , I was operating on the assumption that ' reconciliation ' meant one thing and , from another standpoint and assuming good faith , they were operating on an assumption that it meant something else , " Mr. Goldin said . The fact that a disparity remained had not come to his attention , he said , until sometime after the auditors had be-I gun looking into the accounts for him . A mayoral press spokesman , told about the Controller 's comments , made the following reply : " Controller Goldin was not misled intentionally or unintentionally regarding problems of reconciling bank accounts . Information on this matter was openly furnished last year by employes of the former Controller 's office for reports which he received prior to Jan. 1 . Mr. Goldin now admits knowledge of reconciliation problems at the time he took office ? which he has previously publicly denied . "      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
