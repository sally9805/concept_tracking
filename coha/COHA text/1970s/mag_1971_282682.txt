One of the best ways to save decaying cities is to build a " new town " right in the city 's center . Trouble is , such enormous developments are so expensive in land , relocation and construction costs that most cities have to ask Washington for help-and then wait in line perhaps for years to get the necessary federal funds . <P> Last week Philadelphia showed the way to a short cut . Five major local companies announced plans to build a 50-acre , $400 million " Franklin Town " virtually in the shadow of city hall with hardly any governmental aid . The secret is that the companies ( Smith Kline &; French , I-T-E Imperial Corp. , the Korman Corp. , Butcher &; Sherrerd and Philadelphia Electric Co. ) already own 70% of the land , which they now use mostly for parking lots or obsolete factories . The remaining acreage will be bought by Philadelphia 's redevelopment authority when the city approves the project , then sold to the redevelopers for the full cost of acquisition . No public subsidies are sought . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1980s , Franklin Town will include 4,000 housing units in a wide range of prices , plus offices , shops , hotels and parks . By clustering and mixing these activities , Architect-Planners Philip Johnson and John Burgee hope to keep the new town bustling by day and night . Indeed , Johnson describes the urban project as " by far the most exciting in the world today . " <P> One important feature of the plan is a spacious " town square . " Another is a shop-and-theater-lined boulevard cutting diagonally through Philadelphia 's rectangular grid of streets that will act as a sort of glorified main street , a gathering point for the community . Since the boulevard will mainly serve only Franklin Town rather than the whole city , auto traffic will be light . Says Philip Johnson : " The streets must be primarily built for people and secondarily for cars . " To stress that notion , the plan provides a system of pedestrian walkways , called greenways , in the old Philadelphia tradition . <P> " The project will not only be a good neighborhood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ president of Franklin Town Corp . The corporation will relocate at its own expense the 126 families now living in the area and lend technical and financial assistance to help revivify surrounding neighborhoods . In addition , Philadelphia will directly benefit from a 28-fold rise in real estate taxes from the area . The sponsoring companies also firmly intend to find profit in redevelopment . If they succeed , the Franklin Town formula may serve many other U.S. cities where big companies own large plots in the deteriorating core . " The essential ingredient , " says Nathan , " is corporate commitment to the city-not a desire to escape urban problems by fleeing to the suburbs . "
