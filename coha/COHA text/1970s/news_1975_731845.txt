txt JOHN M. LEWIS is putting pizzaz into holding up men 's pants . Four years ago he and his bride , Nancy , then both 20 , were on welfare . Last year they grossed more than $1 million producing belt buckles . Not JUST belt buckles  --  but BELT BUCKLES ! Glorious , gaudy , gosh-all-mighty pewter half-pounders , strapped right there across your middle for all the world to see , at $5 a copy . Today 's secret swashbuckler can swagger proudly down the avenue , invisible sword at his side , and a three-masted galleon sailing across his midsection between Australia and South Africa , carrying precious gold for Livingston Wells &; Co. of London and Paris . Or , if he 's a Wild West shoot-'em-up fan , he can keep his trousers secure with a graphic antiqued brass depiction of the Dalton Gang robbing the Coffeyville Kas. bank on Oct. 5 , 1892 . Lewis ' line includes buckles portraying Buffalo Bill 's Wild West Show , Sitting Bull , Will Photos on the Back Page Rogers , Coca-Cola , Schlitz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rolls-Royce , Superman , MetroGoldwyn-Mayer , Liberty Bonds , Santa Claus , Colorado State Pen , Buster Brown and Tige , Harley-Davidson , Ripple , the Santa Fe , Pop-eye , and Mickey Mouse . The man behind the buckles , John M. Lewis , now 24 , can be found in a new red brick building , with a cardboard sign in the window , at the far end of Woodwork Lane on the western outskirts of northwest suburban Palatine . " HEY . C'm on IN. " says the Lewis Buckle Co. president , getting casually to his feet from his desk behind the glass display counter . " How about a cup of doffee ? " The president has flaming red hair tied in a pony-tail . Flashing blue eyes . Glistening white teeth . Bright red mustache and well-trimmed beard to match . Turtle-neck and faded blue jeans . In the display case are the 194 models of Lewis ' standard line , plus specialties done for private customers . " Here , let me get one out for you . Feel that metal ? Six and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Winchester Repeating Rifle , the first one we made . In two years we 've sold close to 80,000 of them . " Some of these buckles , like . the Budweiser one here , weigh 8 ounces  --  a full half-pound . That 's the actual Bud label , and ? look real close  --  you can read every word of fine print : This is the famous Budweiser Beer . We know of no other brand .. . " Six years ago the Arlington Heights High School paper labeled this young man the " Senior Class Bad Boy " of the graduating class . A LIFELONG resident of the area , Lewis was in " a lot of trouble as a kid  --  cars and all that . The cops all know me . " As a teen-ager they used to pick him up . Today they come around to chat , and maybe buy a big brass " PIG " buckle ? " Patience , Integrity , Guts  --  America 's Finest . " " After Nancy and I got married we went out West because we wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In San Diego , in 1971 , I was on welfare for five months while looking for work . " Then we went to Phoenix and got into leather work . We came back here and did craft work for art fairs . We 'd make leather belts , and buy antique buckles from England for $4 and $5 wholesale , and get $20 to $25 retail over the counter . " We figured , if people are willing to pay that kind of money , why not see if we can reproduce them at a more reasonable cost and sell more of them ? " Two years ago we started playing games with plastic and buckles . In one week I made 1,000 buckles . We did the casting in the in laws ' basement in Arlington Heights , and the packaging in our garage in Palatine . " NOW WE ? MAKE 25,000 buckles a week . Nancy 's at home with our 10-month-old daughter , but she still does the art work . She and her mother design all the buckles and I do the engraving . Mom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nancy just designed our states series , one buckle for each of the 50 states . " Lewis now has up to 35 people working for him , casting pewter buckleS in rubber molds that resemble eight-inch hockey pucks , polishing , brass-plating , packaging , and mailing . His foreman , Dave Grewe , 17 , graduated from high school a year early ; the mold superintendent , Pete Resek , is 18 , and the oldest employe in the shop is 23 . LEWIS SAID HIS main competition is from Bergamot Brass Works , Lake Geneva , Wis. , tho other companies produce buckles as a sideline . The most expensive buckle Lewis has made is for the Minolta Camera Co . It cost $700 to produce the mold for a buckle that looks exactly like a miniature camera , right down to tiny hex-head screws on the front . The company sells the buckle for $10 to private customers . Easiest to produce are the beer brand buckles , which are made from photoengravings of actual labels . " We have no factory representatives , no salesmen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standard buckles are sold in fine stores , like Marshall Field and Evans Furs , thru regular distributors . People want special buckles , they just find us . " A CASE IN POINT : Mike Connor , advertising manager for Firestone Tire &; Rubber Co . In Akron , wanted a souvenir buckle made to commemorate Firestone 's 75th anniversary . He traced a belt buckle ad in a magazine to a New York distributor , who wrote back , " Call Lewis Buckle Co. in Chicago . " Connor assigned his local representative , John Fowler , to the job , and Fowler finally found Lewis Buckle listed in the Lake Zurich phone directory . The operator told him the number was out of service because the firm had moved to larger quarters , and helped him locate the shop in Palatine . " We ship nationwide , and California is our No. 1 customer , " says Lewis . " P eople from Palatine will buy a Lewis buckle in San Francisco , bring it back home , and say , ' Look what I got out West @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trademarks . We pay royalties to Winchester , Colt , Budweiser , and a few others , but most , like Coca-Cola , seem happy to get the free advertising on buckles . " We had to stop making the Blue Nun wine buckle , tho , because the winery in Germany objected . And both Levi and Wells-Fargo wrote us to cease and desist making buckles with their names  --  because they make their own  --  but they were nice enough to let us sell out our inventory . " Then we 've got the Victor dog buckle , where he 's looking into the Victrola horn : His Master 's Voice . Right after that one came out we got a letter from RCA . I " I said , ' Oh , Oh . Another case of cease and I desist . ' But I opened the envelope , and it was an order for 2,500 ! "
