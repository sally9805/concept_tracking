txt Letters to the Editor Letters to the Editor Of Moscow , MIRV and ' Good News ' To the Editor : Your " good news " editorial of Dec. 6 entitled " Moscow 's Submarine MIRV " is surely provocative . It states that the Soviet Union 's first successful test of a submarine-launched ballistic missile armed with MIRV multiple nuclear warheads is " good news " for the United States and the world . The editorial says the Soviets may be willing , as a result of their technological breakthrough , to ' enter into an agreement stabilizing the nuclear balance for a very long time . There are certainly many who would contend that such an argument is illogical when one considers the history of Soviet negotiation attitudes , and one may wish to examine the patterns of other " good news " we have received from the Soviet Union recently . To be consistent with the thought expressed in the editorial , one might then argue that there is even more " good news " : The Soviets have in the past decade built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then there is the good news that they have deployed the Kiev-class aircraft carrier with **27;856;TOOLONG aircraft and the Delta-class submarine with 4,200-mile-range missiles , which can reach every city in the United States from the home waters of the Soviet fleet . And finally , there is the good news that they are developing a civil defense program capable of sheltering a major portion of their urban population while we have done little in this area . To the Editor : Henry Hurwitz Jr . is worried that a hydroelectric project canceled to save the endangered furbish lousewort will result in generating needed electricity with imported oil and that this will cause inflation letter Nov. 21 . Please , Mr. Hurwitz , examine your assumptions : that more electricity will be needed and that a new hydropower plant will not be inflationary . As to the necessity of new generating capacity , we already have more than we need . Presently we are electrified for 13 percent of our energy needs , although electricity is required for only 8 percent of our end-use needs : 4 percent for industrial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electro-chemistry , arc welding , railways , home appliances , etc . The excess 5 percent is wasted for such low-grade purposes as heating and cooling , which could be accomplished more efficiently by a combination of solar technologies , . winddriven heat pumps , combustion of methane generated from wastes and salvaged industrial waste heat . Furthermore , of the present 8 percent end-use electrical requirement , about 3 percent could be cut out by conservation and technical adjustments . As to the second assumption , any Name in the News To the Editor : The handwriting is on the wall . This country is developing a major case of soppy Carterphilia , and the major television networks are distinguishing themselves by their irresponsible reporting of pure , unadulterated mush . A large amount of time on a recent evening 's newcasts was devoted to such topics as " where Amy will be going to school " and " how Barbara Walters whispered to the President-elect that his daughter left her coat in church " ? and the denouement thereof . ' Surely this sort of trivia could be presented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4fter all , there is no dearth of more monumental news . There are- events relating to earthquakes , pesticides , national economies , cold and hot war , famine and cures for disease . Why are the private lives of all of the Carters becoming so important ? Of course , one must give the networks their due . They are profit-making , and I presume they know their market . Do we then conclude that thoughtful people do not watch the news on TV ? F. J. GOULD Chicago , Dec. 1 , 1976 ? How to Stifle the Elderly To the Editor : The hearing called by the Public Service Commission to discuss the New York Telephone Company 's request for a rate increase is a flagrant act of discrimination against all the senior citizens in the five boroughs in the City of New York . Crimes of violence against seniors are at the highest pitch ever in the city , and for the Public Service Pat Warner An excellent argument can be made that as of today our Navy can still carry out its missions with its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Soviet building trends , could with certainty make this statement five or ten years hence ? Today our Navy has 40 percent fewer ships than it had at the time of the attack on Pearl Harbor . Please , no more " good news " until we have had a chance to rebuild our Navy to guarantee into the future our nation 's security . J. WILLIAM MIDDENDORF 2d Secretary of the Navy Pearl Harbor , Dec. 7 , 1976 centralized power facility , fossil-fueled or hydropower , is inflationary . Half of your electric bill in a system of such facilities goes for fixed distribution costs . Generation on a smaller scale , nearer the point of use , preferably using renewable sun , wind or biopower , would cost far less . In October 's Foreign Affairs , Amory Lovins demonstrates further the inflationary nature of the national energy strategy of which the hydroplant in question is a part . This push toward electrification , from our present 13 percent to a level of 20 to 40 percent by the year 2000 , will be stunningly capital-intensive . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the cost of the massive electrification : $1 trillion for the decade 1976-85 alone . Stunned because that $1 trillion is an estimated 75 percent of the cumulative net private domestic investment ( N.P.D.I. ) over the decade . Seventy-five percent to the energy sector leaves only 25 percent of the N.P.D.I. for all other purposes . Inflationary ? If this energy strategy is implemented , I 'd sure hate to be standing in line for a housing loan in 1985 or for money to build a community hospital or to buy agricultural equipment . JEANNE KOSTER Watertown , S.D. , Nov. 29 , 1976 Commission to suggest that seniors who would want to attend this meeting come out after 7 P.M. and stay until the early morning hours is to invite attack against their persons . We strongly urge and recommend that there be a day session for the seniors , and a night session for those who are not able to attend the day session , so that they also may protest a rate in-crease , This action taken by the Public Service Commission is one of utter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HARRISON Chairperson , Senior Summit Coalition New York , Dec. 3 , 1976 ? Of Landlords and Heat To the Editor : In the case of the two landlords arrested for not providing heat , Investigations Commissioner Nicholas Scoppetta has said that landlords who " in good faith try to provide heat and hot water but are unable to for reasonable cause need not worry about the prospect of criminal charges . " I wonder if insufficient rental income would be considered " reasonable cause . " It costs about $450 a year , per apartment , to provide heat . Many apartments in older buildings rent for $35 to $50 a month , which is $420 to $600 a year . At these rentals , it is almost impossible for a landlord to pay for boiler repairs if the boiler breaks down , pay the oil bill and pay the other expenses of running the building . The money is just not there . JESSE BRYANT New York , Dec. 3 , 1976 Kissinger 's World To the Editor : President-elect Carter should take a long , hard look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lest he commit himself by default to the perpetuation of old policies through the appointment of national security managers schooled in the cold-war consensus . I was astonished that The Times ' lead editorial , " Mr .. Carter 's World " ( Nov. 16 ) , discourages such a reappraisal . It recommended to the new Administration Mr. Kissinger 's world view , which has not changed since ' his first published writings in the 1950's. - To take only one example , the editorial repeated an argument from the 1940 's in urging an improvement in Europe 's " economic atmosphere " to prevent an irreversible " drift toward Communist participation in the governments of Italy and France . " Thirty years later , the Italian and French Communist Parties are still- the only widely accepted representatives of the interests and aspirations of organized labor . They have demonstrated moderation in thought and action , lately in rhetoric as well . On critical occasions they aligned themselves in support of order and incremental change , against chaos and revolution . Italy and France 's political malaise can be ended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effective government of the left is impossible without a Communist share in power and responsibility . The United States would be foolish to block a process that can strengthen the legitimacy of democratic institutions , the capacity to govern and the long-term stability of all of Europe . Communist scare talk by respected Europeans may be comparable to recent arguments urging President Ford 's re-election to bar George Meany or Leonard Woodcock from the White House . If Mr. Carter has read David Halberstam 's " The Best and the Brightest , " he will know that ultimate success in foreign affairs  --  giving him political clout to complete his domestic reforms  --  will depend on his key appointments in the next few weeks . He must look beyond fixed guideposts and discount the recommendations of the old guard  --  including Kissinger and Rusk . In far-ranging personal interviews he should be able to ascertain whose world 3iew was formed in the caverns of the cold war and who has the vision to distinguish substance from shadow . CHARLES R. NAF.r Hamilton , N. Y .. Dec. 3 , 1976 ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's criticism of the New York City Sheriff , as reported in The Times of Nov. 26 , for not depositing funds collected by him on execution of judgments in interest-bearing accounts , implies that the city is rightfully entitled to such interest . The Sheriff in substance is acting as fiduciary for the benefit of the judgment creditor for whom he is collecting the judgment and who pays him a fee for this purpose . He is collecting money belonging to someone else  --  not belonging to the city . The interest earned , if any , should rightfully go to the creditor . The Comptroller should not suggest that the city benefit at the expense of such people . BERNARD H. GOLDSTEIN New York , Nov. 26 , 1976 ? To Respect a Cyclist To the Editor : In reference to Lawrence Rothman 's Dec. 2 letter , it is indeed true that being a bicycle rider in New York City necessitates being " crafty . " Though Mr. Rothman regards bicycle riders as moving vehicles , many motorists do not . Their reaction to a bicycle rider is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dangerously , drivers often open car doors without considering the defenseless cyclist , whose option is to be slammed off the bicycle or to steer into the mainstream of traffic . The attitude of pedestrians toward bike riders is equally irritating . Few pedestrians will walk in front of a moving car ; nevertheless , most will not wait for a bicycle to pass , but will expect the rider to stop . Perhaps when given the respect due a vehicle , the cyclist will obey all traffic lights and laws . Until then , it is a matter of survival . MARLA TEPPER Brooklyn , Dec. 2 , 1976 ? On the Loss of Taste To the Editor : We read with Interest your Nov. 22 news article by Claiborne and Rens , ' berger on gourmets and the sense of taste but feel that your readers should he made aware that loss of taste may be a symptom of an underlying illness . Far from being a rare disorder , blunted taste acuity is being recognized with increased frequency as a concomitant , or even a harbinger , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in taste that may occur during an attack of influenza , other conditions , such as liver failure , thermal burns , an underfunctioning thyroid gland and cancer , may be associated with decreased taste . Loss of taste abilities also has been observed after the use of certain antibiotics , anti-thyroid drugs and medications used to treat rheumatoid arthritis . By increasing patient and phyfa cian awareness of possible defects in the sense of taste , we may arr ! ve at a greater understanding of this sensory system and also bring occult diseasea to medical attention more rapidly .
