Pity the poor $2 bill . Reintroduced last April 13- Thomas Jefferson 's birthday- it simply has not caught on . To most banks , it is one more denomination of currency to worry about . Store clerks object to it because few cash registers have enough slots in their cash drawers to handle an additional denomination . Merchants fear that it will lead to mistakes at checkout counters . Some people even consider it unlucky . <P> The Treasury , having printed 400 million $2 bills on the theory that it could then cut down on the cost of printing so many $1 bills , still has more than half of the deuces on hand . One idea is to eliminate the $1 bill by replacing it with a coin . Then the $2 bill would become a welcome relief from the load of silver people would need every day .
