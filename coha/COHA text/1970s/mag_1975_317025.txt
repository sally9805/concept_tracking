While the Communists embarked on a new phase of Vietnamese history , the Americans who left Viet Nam were carrying on a bitter debate about their final hours in Saigon . At issue was Operation Frequent Wind , the massive effort to get U.S. diplomats , businessmen and journalists , along with many of their Vietnamese employees , out of the country in the days and hours before the Communist tanks moved into Saigon . <P> Luckily , the entire program resulted in very few casualties . Two Marines were killed in the Communist rocket attack on Tan Son Nhut Airport , and last week it was learned that their bodies had been left behind at the Seventh Day Adventist Hospital in Saigon . Nonetheless , it was becoming embarrassingly clear that the hastily conceived operation had failed in its objective of evacuating all those Vietnamese whose lives might be endangered after the Communists came to power . U.S. officials conceded that many people had been left behind whose close connections to the Americans made them likely targets of Communist wrath . Others who had far less to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prostitutes , were safely ferried to U.S. ships waiting off the Vietnamese coast . <P> Pet Poodle . The main problems were panic and haste . General contingency plans for the emergency departure of the Americans had been drawn up months in advance , but no definite lists of Vietnamese whose lives might have been endangered by the Communists were drawn up until practically the last minute . Many officers and officials on the evacuation flagship U.S.S. Blue Ridge were openly bitter about Ambassador Graham Martin 's failure to make firm , clear decisions on how the plan would actually be carried out - feelings that were hardly helped by the sight of Nitnoi , Martin 's pet poodle , being given its daily turn about the deck . On evacuation day the emergency plan fell apart , leaving stranded hundreds of Vietnamese employees of the U.S. embassy , USAID and USIS . Some were never called , and buses were too crowded or failed to make their way to designated pickup points . In one shocking instance , a senior member of the embassy 's Mission Council fled his post for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agency 's evacuation program a shambles . <P> " Saigon did n't give a damn for us , " a Foreign Service officer stationed at the U.S. consulate in the Mekong Delta city of Can Tho told TIME Correspondent William Stewart aboard the Blue Ridge . " We were promised Navy choppers , but the only thing we got was a phone call telling us there was an evacuation . Not just Vietnamese were abandoned but Americans too . The embassy was exercising no initiative , no control . We were told , ' We ca n't worry about Delta employees . ' " <P> In the end , no Americans who wanted to get out were left behind in Viet Nam . Many escaped through their own efforts when it became clear that the official program was failing . In Can Tho , for example , notice of the evacuation only came at the very last minute . Since helicopters had been flown to Saigon or commandeered by the CIA , the consulate 's American employees and a small proportion of its Vietnamese staff went by boat down the Mekong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ searching for the ship that was to have met them there , they luckily chanced upon another U.S. vessel , the Pioneer Contender , which brought them to safety .
