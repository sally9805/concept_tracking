txt The United States Air Force and Navy are battling to see which service would play the major role in any new buildup of American strategic arms . The Air Force controls most of the nation 's strategic missile forces . But no one is certain how long that will last . As Pentagon planners look ahead , it is clear the Navy is to take a far more important share of the nuclear arsenal . It is possible the Navy might find itself in a few years with the major share . The Soviets have continued their strategic development , building six to eight ballistic missiles a year and expanding their **34;424;TOOLONG fields with new types of missiles that have caused deep concern among defense strategists here . It is not clear just where the Soviets will stop . And meaningful agreement at the **26;460;TOOLONG talks has proved elusive . Secretary of Defense Melvin R. Laird has said the services are researching and developing a new manned bomber and a new generation of missile submarines . So far there has been no decision to actually move into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussed If the submarine or the bomber were built , however , it would take until the late 1970 's befoie they would enter the strategic inventory . Meanwhile , however , Russian capabilities in strategic weaponry are increasing at such rapid rates that some think it might be necessary to opt for both long-range improvement of the strategic arsenal as well as short-term stopgap measures . // *Air Force , Navy vie for new strategic arms // Because it is unclear just what the Soviets have in mind , Defense Department strategists have not been able to arrive at unanimity over what should be done or how to do it . Consequently , the situation is this : ? The Air Force is seeking approval for the new bomber , the B-1 , so it can join the air fleet before the present B-52 's become intolerably old and decrepit . At the same time , the Air Force is very much interested in building more Minutemen missile squadrons if it is necessary to move quickly . At present , 1,000 Minutemen II and III missiles are available  --  the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be accomplished rather speedily , and some improvements and innovations also might be possible . ? The Navy is pressing for its undersea , long-range missile system ( ULMS ) either to supplant or augment the present fleet of 41 Polaris Poseidon submarines . In addition , naval strategist 's are giving close consideration to a concept involving placing missiles aboard specially equipped merchant ships for deployment in normal sea lanes over much of the world or where the ships could be protected depending upon needs Air Force concern Many in the Air Force are concerned about how their service might fare if there were a new round of strategic arms building . There are growing doubts about the relative vulnerability of the land-based Minuteman system , even if , t were guarded by the antiballistic missile system now being bought . Beyond that is the fact that outside the Air Force and the Pentagon enthusiam for a new bomber appears limited at best . The General Accounting Office has criticized the Pentagon 's handling of the bomber project and has pegged the estimated cost per copy , if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Both points have given additional ammunition to congressional critics who question whether a new bomber is needed and , if so whether a cheaper one might not do . If the Air Force does not get its new bomber , the bomber aspect of the U.S. strategic arsenal will become steadily less important as the B-52 's and the far less capable FB-111 's age . That would leave the Air Force with only the Minuteman as an important shale of the strategic arsenal . Soviet developments , such as huge multiple warheads for the SS-9 missile , have raised the question of the long-range security of the Minuteman . Limited benefit More hardware would give only additional safety time , and only temporarily , as the Soviet missile accuracy and sophistication advance . And a new missile , while better for getting through Soviet defenses , could not necessarily survive a Soviet strike at the American missile fields any more successfully . Thus it is clear the ' U.S. will inevitably lean more toward the Navy for future strategic developments . And the increasing cost of military hardware plus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pentagon might turn toward some concept such as that of missiles aboard surface ships as a cheap , fast way to get more strategic capability . The Joint Chiefs of Staff have approved a Navy request to design a proposed system . And , according to sources outside the Navy , some naval strategists very much would like permission to build a prototype to test . Supporters maintain such ships could survive the necessary number of hours to launch a second strike against Russia . They argue , too , that it would be impossible for the Soviets to spare the ships and men to keep floating missile ships adequately under watch to prevent their use when needed . Beyond that , supporters say . missile ships at sea would be the most likely to survive of any strategic system that could be bought in short order . The ships would be either new or converted merchant ships . With the wiring and equipment necessary to carry missiles , they would cost in the tens of millions of dollars . or in the same range for each ship as each new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not sit well with the Air Force , which argues that bombers are an extremely flexible part of the nuclear arsenal and a very useful part if the U.S. is to maintain a genuinely balanced force .
