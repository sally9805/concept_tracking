From sea to shining sea , the map dotted with the diverse domes of the nation 's statehouses reflected a disaster for the Republicans . The Democrats scored a net gain of at least four governorships , raising their total to 36 , * their highest tally since 1936 . In their sweep , the Democrats captured eight of the nation 's ten most populous states , including the twin coastal bastions of New York and California , and came close to winning Ohio and Michigan . Next year 73% of all Americans will have Democrats as their Governors . <P> Perhaps the most important reason for the Democrats ' success was nothing more complicated than the fact that the party had generally managed to put forward the most attractive and distinctive candidates in a campaign in which many of the gubernatorial rivals were taking remarkably similar positions . Among the winners were Raul Castro , the first Chicano to be elected in Arizona ; Jerry Apodaca , the first Spanish-surnamed candidate to win in New Mexico in 56 years ; and Hawaii 's George Ariyoshi , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's mansion . <P> The Democrats also succeeded far better than the Republicans in selecting candidates who projected the image of being non-politicians at a time when politicians were often scorned . <P> Profiles of some of the key gubernatorial winners : <P> MASSACHUSETTS ' MICHAEL DUKAKIS , 41 , is a new kind of Democratic politician in a state that has seen all breeds and mutations . He is a political technocrat , a bright and self-righteous reformer who declared that upon becoming Governor , " the first thing I 'm going to do is to begin to introduce the idea of productivity and efficiency goals and standards into state government . " Dukakis spent eight energetic years in the legislature , where he sponsored the nation 's first no-fault automobile insurance . Then he burnished his image for two years as the moderator of The Advocates , a program on current issues by the Public Broadcasting Corporation . One obstacle remained : Republican Governor Francis Sargent , 59 , a leading member of the slowly vanishing species of liberal Brahmins who have struggled for generations to control the state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Dukakis took 56% of the vote . <P> TENNESSEE 'S RAY BLANTON , 44 , a roughhewn , former Democratic Congressman in the populist tradition , found himself matched against one of the few attractive young Republicans to emerge in 1974 : Lamar Alexander , 34 , a lawyer who had helped Senator Howard Baker and retiring Governor Winfield Dunn win elections . Alexander 's main problem turned out to be general dissatisfaction with Dunn 's Republican administration , which had doubled the size of the budget to $2 billion and presented the state 's eastern region with a prison instead of the medical school it had wanted . All this , plus a strong Democratic resurgence in what had briefly been a Republican state , was enough to give Blanton the election by a margin of 56% to 44% . But Alexander 's future remains bright .
