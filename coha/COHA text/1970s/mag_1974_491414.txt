Shotgun blasts sliced the air with sizzling hisses that exploded into the night . Other shots followed in rapid succession . " Look , we got one ! Lousy sea otter has had its last meal at our expense , " the man said smugly . The night swallowed up the crime unnoticed . All that was left of it in the morning was the dead body of a yearling sea otter Silence prevailed . Intense were our studies  --  ours of them , and theirs of us . Ron , continuously and ever so slowly , lowered his form over the side of the boat as he held a prickly sea urchin at water 's edge . All heads faced his food offering with a deathly stillness uncommon to the sea . Ron began to cluck a low guttural sound barely audible at first . In just moments , a small otter slid from his kelp bed nest , disappeared underwater , and instantaneously rose above the surface immediately beside Ron 's hand . The little otter , tense and excited , grasped the urchin with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that had accepted food from Ron during the filming for the TV show .

Ron continued to feed him while 1 slipped into my wet suit and lowered myself slowly and silently into the water . Involuntarily , I gasped for breath as I shivered in the liquid cold . How alien human beings are to this world of the sea , I thought , as I moved slowly away from the boat . washing in the surf line on a Monterey , California , beach . Sea otters have been hunted , mass murdered into near extinction , and have even become victims of nuclear explosions . Man 's selfish interests have often disregarded the wants and needs of other living creatures that are incapable of defense against man 's weapons . The sea otter has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea otter has returned from near extinction , but wanton killings of this unique sea animal continue .... The dead sea otter in the Monterey surf line was a personal loss to my husband and me. as well as to a half dozen other divers , who had grown to know , respect and love him . It brought an untimely end to an intelligent , curious and , at times , impish character of the sea ... one who had learned to accept man into his world , who had shared it with him , who had learned to trust man and yet was repaid by a shotgun blast in the stomach . Incredible  --  unreal unbelievable  --  but true . 1 first became acquainted with the sea otters less than three years ago while my husband was filming them for Jacques Cousteau 's TV special " The Unsinkable Sea Otter . " But it was some time later during several diving vacations that I gained real insight into the ways of these marvelous animals of the sea . On my first dive in Monterey 's chilling waters , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end . The gray mist of dawn breathed upon us as our little boat silently drifted toward a pod of sleeping sea otters . We were sure we would disturb none of them by our stealthy approach ; yet , otter heads peeped one by one , chain reaction fashion , high above their floating kelp beds which had moments before concealed their whereabouts . Now eyes like polished black pearls queried us . Several otters paddled off down the coast to high surf . I hung suspended in the otter world of water and kelp . The dawn cast an awesome glow upon the water and showed the otters more clearly to me . I waited ! The wet chill was more penetrating as the minutes clicked on ... ten .. . fifteen ... twenty .... I tried to move my toes but they were held useless in thick rubber booties and giant web fin protrusions . My feet and legs felt as if they were a permanent part of the sea , as if no longer alive and warm-blooded . Ron cautioned me not to move . I held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes passed . In desperation , I called to Ron 's little sea otter . " Come on , little fellow . Come here . " And for no apparent reason , Ron 's little otter began to move toward me . His eyes pierced mine . He was watching every perceptive sign of danger and , I was sure , even the beating of my heart . I held out the urchin . He dove under the thick carpet of kelp that lay sprawled between us . The little form surfaced under a kelp frond some fifty yards from me . He stared at me in frightened silence . I continued my senseless baby chatter to him . " Come on , little fellow , come on . It 's O.K. Sure ... here 's some food . Come on , little baby . " The words seemed to quiet his apprehensions ; he dove . He circled all around me underwater . He broke surface perhaps twenty yards closer and then began to swim slowly towards me ... his nose leading the way like a hound in the hunt . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hand-feeding this timid , sensitive , wild animal that I no longer felt the cold , no longer heard Ron 's instructions , no longer saw the seagulls overhead or any of the other otters about us . At that moment I was aware of nothing else except this exquisite mammal as he approached me . His every sense was tense , alert and cautious . Would I befriend him or turn traitor . His instinct and his long parental training had told him " tobeware of man ... man the killer ... man the mortal enemy . " When he was within ten feet of me , he began to practice his escape tactics , which proved so comical that I nearly burst into laughter . With extended forepaws he would swim toward me and then jet in reverse only inches away from his goal , turning head over heels in his backward somersault retreat . At times his head would be on the same plane as his back flippers which would look like giant ears of " Dumbo " the elephant . Again and again he would make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he practiced his speedy reverse . Then he dove and came up a foot away from me . He studied me closely , his entire framework panting fear . My garbled chatter ceased in a silence that was frightening . A silence unearthly in nature . Even the everpresent roar of the sea was starkly silent . I wanted to coax him farther , but nothing came from my throat . The reality of our meeting was naked before us . We hung motionless as death in the stilled waters . A wet chill swept over me in one brief moment . I knew this was the otter 's last try . He would accept the food or flee in fright and remain a stranger to me . Tensed as a race horse at the starting line of the Kentucky Derby , the perceptive little otter moved in , grasped the urchin between his dextrous paws , and reversed his position instantly . A thrill so exhilarating ignited in me that no words can describe the experience . It must be akin to the thrill the hunter knows at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of acceptance into the world of a strange , wild animal , not the thrill of destruction . In that moment , I thought of the fear and natural in-stinct this animal had to overcome to accept food from me , a stranger , a potential threat or assassin . Only in the last sixty years have sea otters been protected by law . Before then , the sea otters were considered " Sea Gold . " Fur hunters converged upon their natural range from the frozen had been the cause of our otter 's death . It was hard to conceive that man would kill an otter over his ability to get abalone from the sea floor . How this was accomplished was a mystery and our goal photographically . Like many others , we had observed tool use above the water many times , but we wanted to get pictures of such activity underwater , something which had never before been accomplished by anyone to our knowledge . The otter was believed to remove abalone from its secure hold on a rock by the use of a tool . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring it to the surface for a tasty dinner ? Broken shells also indicated that the otters might smash the shell while the abalone is attached to the rock and force it to release its grip . Man uses an abalone iron as a lever to release the abalone 's tenacious hold . Even with this long slender iron shoved under the foot of the abalone , it takes no mean effort to pry the abalone loose . Abalone in the Monterey ( sea otter range ) are scarce , so to acquire photographs of tool use , we had transferred a few abalone on various rocks . But before the abalone would have a chance to clamp down securely , an inquisitive otter would steal it and foil our plans of photographingtool-use . Whenever we located an abalone in its natural location , it would be either too hidden from camera 's view or wedged between rock crevices which were shielding it from possible sea otter poundings . It seemed impossible to transplant an abalone or to photograph one being retrieved in its natural location . Ron struck upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clean beach rock for a few hours until the abalone had securely sealed upon the rock . This we did , and it worked too . We took the rock encrusted with abalone down to the bottom , and thus set up the feeding station . We waited to observe tool use . At long last a large otter came down , felt the abalone on the rock , pulled at them and then picked up the entire rock with all the abalone and went laboriously humping to the surface with the greatest find of his lifetime . . . much to our dismay . Not to be outsmarted by the clever otter , we were off for a bigger rock and more abalone . Several hours later the same experiment was under way . Ron had secured a huge rock that he could hardly carry on board the boat . The abalone were securely sealed , and all was well until Ron tried to get into the water . He tumbled overboard and dropped straight away to the bottom , whichwas fortunately only thirty feet below the boat . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but lie was not about to try to move the rock and defied any otter to surface with it . Ron was back on the surface in an instant . " That was fast , " I chided with a grin as I handed him the cameras and lights . He nodded his head sheepishly and motioned for me to quickly get into the water and play guard over the abalone rock . While Ron was setting up the cameras and lights , I ' sat on the abalone and distracted the otters by feeding them squid and urchins . I felt like I was an underwater mother hen about to hatch a half dozen lumpy abalone . I moved away and down came " White Face , " a beautiful otter with a long white cape . He bristled with enthusiasm at the prospect of the abalone . His whiskers wiggled over the rock repeatedly , his paws clamped onto a large abalone , but it would not yield . We had placed an assortment of different sized rocks all around the abalone . He picked up a small rock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fast as they would recycle . They did not daunt " White Face . " He was too intent upon his food . " Another rock might do it ! " He threw down the first rock and picked up a larger one , then another , and another until he had tried each rock . Much to our chagrin he disappeared , though we did not think " White Face " would give up so easily . We were not disappointed , for he returned within a few seconds with a huge rock about one foot long , three inches thick and six inches wide . A real tool ! Our rocks had not been big enough ; he found his own . With one whack to the abalone , it popped off the rock and into the paws of another otter . White Face could not tolerate this . He was nearly out of breath but tackled the thief with the force of a pro football giant . White Face squeezed the abalone from the intruder just as they reached the surface and left for a well deserved abalone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ underwater , but he must have been down a record time . From that point on we were able to observe and photograph several techniques of tool use underwater . The side technique is the most effec-tive . One blow on the edge will lift the abalone free . The most experienced otters use this approach with a very large rock . Some pound using an upward swing , making contact as the rock is lifted up and under the edge of the abalone . Some will pound straight down and break the shell . One poor little otter investigated the abalone , tried to bite it off and then in complete frustration picked up a rock . He seemed to know that the abalone was food and the rock was for pounding but could not quite put it all together to get the abalone . He placed his nose on the abalone and pounded away at his stomach ! Ele finally gave up as he had to surface for air . Naturally we nicknamed him " Dummy . " Yet the sea otters are far from dumb . They display @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any new situation carefully before deciding what to do . Their relationship with one another shows a high degree of intelligence and respect for their own kind ... the spirit of the chase ... the innovations that are exhibited in their games ... their persistent efforts for dominance in the pursuit of food ... the mother 's ceaseless efforts in caring for her young , All of these traits and their unique tool-using ability made the otters endearing to us . Most of all we loved the otters because they had learned to overcome their instincts which told them to fear man : man the kilter . As we packed our cameras for the last time and left the world of the sea otter , we prayed that none of these little animals would come to harm by those who resent their ability to acquire the abalone . We could only hope that someday man will learn to live with nature , respect her wild animals and allow them their just right to remain a part of the living for future generations to know and to love . Where , indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to enjoy , to know , to love ?
