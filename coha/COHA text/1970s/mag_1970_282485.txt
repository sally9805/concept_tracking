MANY people joke about surgeons leaving assorted instruments in their patients . Not John Everard , 33 , a worker in an airplane factory in Glendale , Calif . Shortly after Everard had undergone a gallbladder operation , he began to feel pains in his lower right abdomen . His physician assured him that his discomfort was normal and would soon disappear . It persisted ; more than two years later , an X ray revealed why : Everard 's surgeon had failed to remove a hemostat , or surgical clamp , which had lodged in his patient 's abdominal cavity . The facts speak for themselves , argued Everard 's attorney . They did indeed . Holding that such a condition could only result from negligence , a court duly awarded the man $12,500 . <P> <P> The issues were less clear-cut in the case of Mrs. Santa Teriaca , 51 , a Cleveland housewife . Bothered by the worsening of a chronic limp , she had an operation for the removal of a small tumor on her spinal cord , and ended up paralyzed from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unfortunate but unavoidable . Mrs. Teriaca replied that she had been unaware of the risks . " The doctors , " she told the court , " only told me that it would be as simple an operation as a tonsillectomy . " The defendants apparently agreed that they should have told her more about the risks involved in the operation . The case was settled out of court for $40,000 . <P> <P> Far more frightening is the case of Louisa Alvaro , 26 . A healthy mother of two , she began to hemorrhage during delivery of normal twins at a New York City hospital . Fifteen hours later she was dead . Doctors and hospital officials contended that her death was the result of a pre-existing liver condition and that everything had been done to save her . Her husband 's attorney proved otherwise . Relying on expert testimony that tests were needed to determine the compatibility of Mrs. Alvaro 's blood with blood administered during a transfusion , he was able to show that no tests were performed and that Mrs. Alvaro was virtually ignored by hospital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . Accepting the lawyer 's contention that Mrs. Alvaro died because " nobody cared , " a jury found the hospital and attending physicians negligent . The final award : $60,000 to the woman 's family .
