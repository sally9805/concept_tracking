In negotiations , the Soviets tend to be blunt , the Chinese insinuating . The Soviets insist on their prerogatives as a great power . The Chinese establish a claim on the basis of universal principles and a demonstration of self-confidence that attempts to make the issue of power seem irrelevant . The Soviets , with all their stormy and occasionally duplicitous behavior , leave an impression of extraordinary psychological insecurity . The Chinese convey an aura of imperviousness to pressure ; indeed , they pre-empt pressure by implying that issues of principle are beyond discussion . Chinese diplomats , at least in their encounters with us , proved meticulously reliable . They never stooped to petty maneuvers ; they did not haggle ; they reached their bottom line quickly , explained it reasonably , and defended it tenaciously . They stuck to the meaning as well as the spirit of their undertakings . As Chou was fond of saying , " Our word counts . " <P> <P> Kissinger had a chance to compare Soviet and Chinese negotiating styles because of a momentous development : the opening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when concept encounters opportunity , " and Nixon realized that the bloody border clashes between Soviet and Chinese troops in the summer of 1969 presented just such an opportunity . Fearful of a pre-emptive attack by Moscow or an all-out war , the Chinese were looking for a counter-threat to Soviet pressure . At that very moment , the U.S. was subtly signaling Peking that it was interested in a fundamental change in their relationship . There followed what Kissinger calls " an intricate minuet , so stylized that neither side needed to bear the onus of an initiative , so elliptical that existing relationships on both sides were not jeopardized . " The complex maneuvers began paying off . In October 1970 , Nixon asked Pakistan 's President Yahya Khan , who was about to visit Peking , to let the Chinese know that the U.S. was ready to improve relations . <P> <P> Head to Head <P> On Dec. 8 , Pakistan 's Ambassador Agha Hilaly said that he had " a message " for me relating to Yahya 's trip . I invited Hilaly to the White House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes after 6 p.m. he produced an envelope containing a handwritten missive on white , blue-lined paper which had been carried to him by hand , Yahya not trusting the security of cable communications . ( This was to be the form for all messages through the Pakistani channel . ) Hilaly said he was not authorized to leave the document with me . <P> He therefore had to dictate it as I copied it down . We did not notice the incongruity of this elegant spokesman of the elite of a country based on an ancient religion dictating a communication from the leader of a militant Asiatic revolutionary nation to a representative of the leader of the Western capitalist world ; or the phenomenon that in an age of instantaneous communication we had returned to the diplomatic methods of the previous century-the handwritten note delivered by messenger and read aloud . <P> The message was not an indirect , subtle signal . It was an authoritative personal message to Richard Nixon from Chou Enlai , who emphasized that he spoke not only for himself but also for Chairman Mao and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
