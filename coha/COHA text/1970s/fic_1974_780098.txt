 | The mine and the billowing smelter on the hill made the arsenic , and it was as hard on people as it was on flowers . The mining smoke made beautiful orange and red and yellow sunsets , and death . But Orlean was not going to let her last geranium die without a battle . That cow was about to be clouted on the rump with all the ferocity an avenging broom could muster . Orlean jerked the door open wide , her broom raised high . But it was n't a cow . It was a young man loaded down with groceries , who was thumping the door with his foot . He had two bulging brown bags under his arms , and a sack of eggs held between his teeth , and he was trying to smile within slight embarrassment . " Oh ! " she murmured in her own sudden and greater embarrassment , quickly lowering the broom and taking the package of eggs from his mouth . That was the first word she ever said to him . And it was also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love . That tiny , inner magic took less than the blink of a fleeting second , and yet the magic was so strong that it lasted always . How such a thing could happen so fast , and so forever , she never really understood , or even tried to figure out . It was like all those other things that you just simply know , and do n't have to bother your mind with . The young man was tall , and overwhelmingly handsome , with a jaunty leather cap angled rakishly down over incredibly bright , sparkling blue eyes that seemed filled with silent , mischievous laughter . Yet there was something else deeper in his eyes . Orlean could see that he would understand about earth and music , and about mean spotted cows , and the crucial importance of one last , red geranium . " I 'm from Swenson 's Groceries ? " He made a question of the words .  | She nodded timidly , quickly backing out of his way with the eggs . He stepped to the kitchen table just as one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he got there in time and put them down safely . Relieved , he turned and took off his cap , smiling . " You were holding that broom like a ball bat . " " ? I thought you were a cow . " As Orlean finished speaking in her shy voice , she wished she 'd said it some other way , but the words were already out . His smile deepened . " One time up in Wyoming a fella mistook me for a mountain lion and took a shot at me , but at least that was at night . " Orlean wanted to explain the whole thing about defending her geranium , and make him understand . But the words she needed just were n't coming to her , and he was already starting back toward the door . Before going out he looked back once more with his skyblue , penetrating eyes and said , " My name 's Clair . Thank you , Miss Bird . " And then he was gone . But he knew her name ! Orlean quickly put the eggs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the window . He was pedaling down the dusty street on Swenson 's delivery bike with the big , bent , wire basket on the back . Then she realized crushingly that he 'd have to know her name , just to know where to make the delivery . Ten thousand things she could have said and should have said , and she had n't said one . Why could n't she be quick and glib like all those other girls who always seemed to have something to say ? Now he turned at the corner and went out of her sight on the bike , still looking handsome , somehow , even from the back . Orlean moved slowly from the window then and silently busied herself sorting the groceries and putting them in the cupboard and icebox.  | While stacking the last cans of beans in the cupboard she finally broke her silence and muttered angrily to herself , " Boy , are you a dumbbell ! " Then , in a higher , self-mocking voice , " Ohhh , kind sir , I thought you were a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear . Why could n't I have told him he did look more like a mountain lion , or Rudolph Valentino or something ? ! " Then she went out into the small back yard and split some kindling at the woodshed , so that she could get a fire started in the stove . By the time Orlean heard the distant clanging of the bell on the Bamburger trolley coming slowly back from Salt Lake , the house was clean , the wash done , and supper was cooking on the glowing hot stove . Her two sisters , Melva and Margaret , had taken the Bamburger to town , and a few minutes later they arrived in the gathering dusk . The twenty-mile trolley trip to Salt Lake cost ten cents per person each way , so a trip to town was something special . And Margaret , a red-headed pixie of a girl a little younger than Orlean , was still filled with the excitement of the big city . " We saw a Rin Tin Tin movie that , honest , you would n't believe ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cliff to save a little boy in a river ! " Melva , the oldest of the sisters , shook her head in amused agreement . " Like the man says , I swear that dog 's just not human . " " Oh , Melva ! " Margaret laughed . There was time before supper , so Melva made some secret coffee and she and Margaret told Orlean all about their day 's trip , and how the city was changing and growing right before your very eyes . The stern-faced Elders in that Mormon town would have been outraged about the church-forbidden coffee . But the  | girls were agreed that what the Elders did n't know could n't curt them . And besides , in some mysterious way it made the coffee taste better . Finally , Orlean mentioned as offhandedly as possible the thing she 'd been waiting anxiously to bring up from the beginning . " ? Swensons , ? has a new delivery man . " " Ile clerks there , too , " Melva said . " We gave him our order this morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , looking at Orlean thoughtfully , she added , " He 's a nicelooking boy . " " Roy ? " Orlean frowned . " He 's a young man . " " What I meant was , " Melva said , " he 's only about your age . " " And that 's not all , " Orlean went on , taking a sip of coffee . When she was alone with the sisters she 'd grown up with , she could sometimes work wonders with words . " He may be kind of young , like you say , but he 's been around a whole lot . Why , he was even in some kind of a shooting scrape up in Wyoming , but got out of it okay . " " That 's awful ! " Margaret 's eyes were wide with delight . " Did he shoot somebody ? ! " " Oh , no . ? I guess he just sort of managed to smooth everything all over , finally . I can tell that he 's just naturally that kind of a strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swell ! " Margaret said . " I 'd like to hear all about it ! " " No ! " Orlean said quickly . " I know for sure he would n't want to talk about it any more . I was just saying he 's a man , not a boy like Melva said . " Melva began pouring what was left of the coffee , splitting it three ways . " Must have took him most of the afternoon to bring in all those groceries . "  | " Oh , no . We just talked for a little while . His name 's Clair . " " Clair ? " Margaret said . " That 's a funny name . " " It 's not either funny , Margaret ! It 's just different . " " What 's really funny , " Melva said , " is that just about nobody 's ever seen him around here before . He 's one of old Frank Huffaker 's sons , and that family 's been here for years . " Margaret 's eyes grew wide again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been in jail ! " " Oh , I doubt it very much ! " Orlean said quickly . " I do n't think it was anything anywhere near all that serious , at all . " " Well , maybe not . " Margaret was still enchanted by her idea . " But where 's a better place to learn to smoke at our age than in jail ? ! " " He smokes ? ! " Though Orlean did n't like even the look of cigarettes , this was a telling point in terms of a young man being adventurous and mature beyond his years . " How do you know ? " Melva asked . " When we left Swenson 's I saw him go out and up and light one , right back there in the alley . " Melva looked down at the table . " Altogether , it looks  --  like he 's pretty fast . " " Well , " Orlean reminded her , " we 're all three of us drinking coffee . We 're fine ones , or that darn Church either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he wants to . " " For heck 's sake , " Margaret said , " nobody 's blaming him for it . " " For that matter , " Orlean went on firmly , " one of these days I 'm going to have a cup of coffee and try a cigarette too . " " When you do it , " Margaret asked , " can I do it with you ? " " You two will get us all thrown out of town , or at least out of the Church . " Melva stood up . " We 'd better start setting table . Al will be home pretty quick . "  | " It 's almost time , " Margaret said in a sudden , excited panic . " I 've got to run to meet Darrell at the Ward . " She hugged and kissed them both and then hurried out . Melva called after her , " Do n't be too late after Ward meeting . " As the other two sisters began to put the plates out , Melva studied Orlean for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little low on salt . " " I thought we had plenty . " " No , I should have ordered another two-pound bag . ? Would you mind going down to Swenson 's for me , ? tomorw , and getting it ? " ( ) rlean hesitated , then put the plate in her hands down on the table and said , " Oh , ? no . " " It 's time you started getting out once in a while , like Margaret does with Darrell . Otherwise , you 'll just waste away around this house and work yourself to death , and wind up the only Old Maid in the family . " They were both starting to smile now , as they worked . " Well , Melva , sixteen 's hardly an Old Maid age . " " It 's as good an age as any to start worrying . " A little later Al came home , walking heavily down the halftoile long , dark path from the huge mill looming high above , and showing deeper black in the sky than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always like this when a mine-shift went off . A seemingly unending , antlike stream of dimly seen , almost invisible men who all looked alike in the dark , each wearing Levi coveralls with suspenders that came up over the back and snapped onto the chest-high bib . And each man was carrying a black , now empty , lunchpail . Al was big and stout , a jolly man who laughed and talked too much and too loudly . But he had a good heart , was a good provider , and a good husband to Melva.  | When Orlean went to sleep in their small back room , Margaret still had n't come home . She went to sleep with music within her playing gently in her mind . The music was , " Pony Boy . "  | NEXT day , after finishing her chores , Orlean heated the iron on the stove , which was still hot from cooking breakfast , and brought out her good dress , the blue polka-dot print with the white lace collar , to press it . She was relieved that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone with Melva . Al would have roared and rocked with laughter and said something like , " All that fussin ' just t ' walk down t ' Main Street ? This is Magna , not fancied-up Salt Lake ! Heck , a gal could walk downtown in a gunnysack , an ' worst 'd happen 's they accidentally sell her f'r a bag a ' grain ! " This was one of his well-meant , repeated jokes , on the few times in the last months that Orlean had built up enough courage to leave the house . But today she was being even more careful , wanted so much more to please . And Melva understood . After brushing her hair a long time , and then tying it in her favorite yellow ribbon , Orlean finally came into the kitchen , ready to go . Melva was drying dishes at the sink , and she turned and said quietly , " ? You sure do look pretty . " Orlean smiled with shy pleasure . " Well , I guess I better go .  --  Anything else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salt . " Orlean took a tin cup of water from the sink and went out the kitchen door to kneel on the step and water the last geranium .  | " Honey , " Melva called from the kitchen . " That flower might look real nice pinned on your dress . " Orlean hesitated with the cup of water , and Melva came to the door to look it over more closely . " You can see that copper mine air 's got to it . It 's still pretty now , but it 'll be dead tomorrow . Might as well wear it . " After a silent moment , Orlean said , " No . " She began to slowly pour the water onto the hard , barren earth in the pot . " It will live another day . " Melva took the empty cup from Orlean 's hand and said , " You do n't need a flower , anyhow . " She smiled . " You 're one all by yourself , little sister . " Their eyes met for a long , warm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was only three short , dusty blocks down to Main Street , but in it 's own way , to Orlean , it seemed more like a thousand miles . She kept to the harder dirt of the sidewalk , thinking of the empty times she 'd tried to make this walk in the last little while , and finally gone back home fighcing down tears . A model T chugged by , belching heavy smoke and dust from its rear end and wheels . After it was gone she passed some children playing kick-the-can in the street and shouting in high , thin voices as the battered can flew here and there . She paused to pat a friendly , panting dog who was sitting on the sidelines of the game . And then she went on to Main Street without seeing anyone else at all . Turning left on Main Street , where the town 's single line of business buildings began , Orlean had the hollow feeling that she could see her whole world , now and forever , and she did n't want to face it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stretch had cement sidewalks , and those short , cemented walks , plus some tall , wooden , electric light poles , were the most up-to- date things in town . Running west , Main Street finally made an abrupt right turn , veering off and down toward the endless gray flats where an immense , low dyke contained the muddy slag from the mine . Otherwise the street would have run right into the steep , battle-scarred mountain with the smoking mine high up on it . Close on her left , the Gem Theater was playing " Her Gilded Cage " with Gloria Swanson . And from there on , business buildings were packed pretty solidly along that side of the street clear to the mountain . But on the right hand side of the dusty street , buildings were older and more scarce , most of them with badly peeling paint and dirty , often cracked windows . All in all , there were about fifteen saloons along the street , four grocery stores , two lumberyards , a combined fire station and sheriff 's office , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sales and Service Shop , and a J.C . Penney . Orlean was starting to get that same feeling again . Just turn around and go back home . But she forced herself to walk on toward Swenson 's Groceries . Thank Heaven it was only half way , and it was on the left side so she did n't have to cross Main Street . She passed the Hi-Ho Bar &; Grill , and heard the clicking of pool balls along with men 's low voices and laughter . That was n't too bad , because somehow they were friendly sounds . A little farther on , Mrs. Gelbert , carrying a pink parasol and wearing a ruffled dress , went by her on the sidewalk . Mrs. Gelbert did n't slow down , but glanced at her briefly and said , " My , do n't the townspeople look fine today . " Orlean had no answer , nor the time to make one anyway , for the old woman had already swept imperiously on by . Mrs. Gelbert lived up on the B &; G Row , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mountain near the mill . The Row was where the mining superintendents and high-up bosses lived . Two more cars went grumbling by , one of them slowing for a gray mongrel scratching its ear in the road . The horn made two or three raspy , irritated noises before the dog got up , and he and the car went their separate ways . And then , finally , Orlean was at Swenson 's . When she entered the store , Mr. Swenson saw her from behind the counter and said , " My goodness , I have n't seen you in a coon 's age . " She nodded and smiled shyly at him , then started looking through the store as though there were many purchases on her mind . She found Clair at the far end of the cereal counter , where he was stacking round boxes of oatmeal . Even without his rakish cap he was as handsome as ever , his black , wavy hair falling down over one eye . He smiled happily and said , " Hey , there . Did I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? no , " she managed . " I , was looking for the salt . " " It 's over this way . " He led her a few steps to where it was and then said , " How much do you want ? " She was relieved to have this answer right at hand . " Two pounds . " " Anything else ? " " No , " she hesitated , " ? I do n't think so . " " Well , sure is real nice seeing you again so soon . " She could feel herself blushing slightly , along with her small , timid smile . " Listen , " he continued . " It 's too hot a day for you to carry this clear home . I could drop it by for you after work . "  | " It 's , ? too much trouble . " " No , it ai n't . I can just wheel by on my new Indian . Do you like motorcycles ? " " ? I suppose so . " " Then I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a honey . " " ? All right . " Orlean took a hesitant step backward , then turned and hurried away . A little later , Wayne came out from behind a nearby stack of shelves that he had been dusting . Wayne was Clair 's younger brother , and the two of them resembled one another to much that they were sometimes mistaken for each other by people who did n't know the family too well . It was Wayne who had persuaded old man Swenson to hire on his big brother , despite the somewhat shady reputation that Clair was rumored to have built up in Wyoming and in Salt Lake . Wayne started dusting the shelves next to where Clair was stacking the boxes of oatmeal . " Boy , you are really somethin ' , " Wayne said in a low voice , so that Swenson would n't hear and think they were loafing on the job . " ? A real lady killer . " " Oh , come on , kid . " " Less'n a week in town , an ' you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Wayne shook out his dust rag . " That one 's name 's Orlean Bird . " Clair said quietly , " I got a feelin ' that she 'd faint dead away if anybody said boo ' to her . " Wayne nodded . " She 's always been sort of tongue-tied , sort of a wallflower kinda gal . Even more that way now , ? , than before . " " Than before what ? " " Before what happened to her Ma and Pa . They both died s year . Pa in January , and Ma in May . One right after the  | other . " Wayne hesitated , thoughtful as he worked . " Some say her Ma went because a ' heartbreak . The other Bird kids got over it okay , an ' more or less normal . But not her . She ai n't hardly showed her face , or said a word if nobody , ever since . " " I guess , maybe , she 's kind a ' easy if hurt hard . " " Yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy layer of dust from a high shelf . " But there 're a whole ton a ' cuties around town that 've been givin ' you the eye , and that 're real high-livin ' sports , Clair . ? Beats me that ya 'd see anything in a quiet , sorta backward little girl like Orlean . " " Well , for one thing , Wayne , " Clair said , " I kinda like the way she wears that yellow ribbon in her hair . "  | The sun was almost going down when Clair roared into Orlean 's yard on his big , scarlet Indian , gunning the engine just the right amount to make the rear wheel spin in a skidding , sharp turn that threw up a cloud of dust behind him . Turning into the sun , he noticed with a certain pleasure that large , scattered chunks of the vast , flaming yellow and red sunset over the western hills were almost exactly the same color as the brilliant scarlet of his cycle . Wayne , the bag of salt in one hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ independent to hold onto his older brother , but staying in place by leg grip and balance alone . Clair parked in the yard , and as they got off Orlean came out of the door toward them , studying both Clair and the powerful machine with wide , slightly awestruck eyes . Melva came out behind her , drying her hands on a dish towel . " Well , there she is , " Clair grinned . " Ai n't she a honey ? " Orlean nodded quietly . " Oh , ? yes . " Clair wiped an imaginary spot off the gleaming red body . " Two-stroke cylinder , thirty horses . Only four years old and good as new . She 'll do sixty on a straightaway , then turn on a dime and give ya change . " " It-certainly is beautiful , " Orlean said . " Would ya like t ' take a ride on ' er sometime ? " Forcing as much enthusiasm as she could manage , Orlean said " Oh , ? yes ! " Melva looked at it suspiciously . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as open , travelin ' caskets. " 29  | " Oh , no , ma'am . " Now facing the older girl , Clair took off his cap . " Not if ya know how t ' handle them . " " One time , " Wayne said proudly , " Clair drove a cycle right smack through a speakeasy in Salt Lake . In the front door and out the back at a real good clip , and he did it so fast and smooth that nobody even spilled a drink . " Then , seeing Clair 's frowning expression he added lamely , " ? He just did it that one time  --  on a bet . Uhh , ? here 's your salt , ma'am . " " Thanks . " Melva took the salt . " I 'd rather get it out here than have you drive through the kitchen with it . " Wayne dropped his eyes slightly . " Yes , ma am . " Do n't be too long , Orlean . ? And do n't go for a ride on that bike . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Never mind about her , " Orlean said . " Her bark 's worse than her bite . " " Oh , shoot , anybody can see that . " Clair grinned easily . " Well , I guess we better be goin ' . " Wishing him to stay , even a few moments longer , Orlean said , " It 's  --  such a beautiful motorcycle . Why do n't you use this , instead of Swenson 's beat-up old bike , to deliver gro-ceries ? " " What ? Use this to deliver groceries ? " Clair was appalled . " Why heck , that 'd be like , ? usin ' a racehorse to pull a plow . That 'd be a terrible thing for a fella to do . " " ? Oh . " Orlean retreated inwardly , distressed at seeming to ! have somehow offended him . " ? Of course , you 're right . " In turn , Clair now sensed her inward retreat , and he smiled suddenly , warmly . " Hey , listen ! Ya want me t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Orlean found herself returning the smile . " Yes , I 'd like that . " " Okay . " He got on the seat and kicked the resting rod back up into place . " Nothin ' too fancy . Just give ya an idea how easy she handles . " He now kicked the engine to low , growling life and gunned it slightly a couple of times . Then , making  | graceful , arcing turn , he drove slowly out of the yard , Orlean and Wayne following him as far as the street . On the long , empty , dusty road , Clair swiftly accelerated , going from almost a stop to a breakneck speed within a hundred feet or so and churning up huge mists of billowing dust . Then abruptly , at full speed , he hit the brakes and swung the front wheel at the same time so that he skidded completely around in a long , spinning turn and came to a sudden dead stop facing back in the direction he 'd come from . Watching his spectacular turn breathlessly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more terrified . But in either case there was an overwhelming and joyous feeling within her of deliciously shared danger and adventure . As he roared back down the street toward where they were standing , Orlean said in a small , thin voice , " Does  --  he always stop that way ? " Wayne shook his head . " Not with me ridin ' in back of him he do n't . I 'd a ' wound up sailin ' about three blocks farther on up the road . " Then , as Clair began at high speed to swerve widely from left to right on his way back down the dusty street , he added , " I got a hunch that , maybe , he 's tendin ' t ' show off just a little bit . " " Ile is ? " This thought delighted Orlean more than she could say . " But  --  he wo n't hurt himself ? " " Nah . He can do anything but backward somersaults on them wheels . " Now Clair cut off into a big , empty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a wide circle once , and then with perfect balance and precision he made three or four swift , constantly narrowing figure eights on the motorcycle , the last one so tight and fast that the front wheel was almost turning around and into the back wheel in a swirling blur of dust . Still hardly breathing , Orlean said , " That 's  --  just unbeliev-able ! "  | Wayne glanced back at the house . " I hope your big sister ai n't watchin ' . She 'd likely have a heart attack . " Clair saved his best trick for last . Finishing the figure eights , he started back across the field toward them with a tremendous burst of speed . And leaning back , at the same time pulling up on the handlebars , he raised the front wheel high off the ground into the air , so that he was traveling on the wildly spinning back wheel only . " My gosh ! " Orlean gasped . " He looks just like he 's on a rearing stallion ! " And then , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But by then Clair was already near the edge of the field and he put the front wheel down , easing off on the gas so that as he crossed the street toward them he was moving slowly and in easy control , the engine idling quietly . " My goodness ! " Orlean stammered . " You could , ? you could go to work for a circus ! " Clair 's smile was broad and delightedly triumphant . " Sure is a grand cycle , ai n't it ? Hotter'n a firecracker ! " With a deft flip of his wrist he gunned the idling engine into a loud roar . But then his smile disappeared instantly as the gunned-up motorcycle stuck at full gas and came to sudden , furious life , snarling forward and thundering past Orlean and Wayne and on by them into the yard . By whirling around swiftly , they were able to see what happened in the next few , shattering seconds . The cycle was hopelessly caught at full gas intake , and within twenty feet it was charging along like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house but somehow managed to pull off at the last moment , so that now he was headed like an unleashed bolt of lightning toward the neighbor 's fence instead . Just before the crudely built and sloppily whitewashed wood fence , there was a small rise in the ground . And when  | the Indian hit that rise it took off like a low-flying airplane , so that Clair and the cycle hit the fence head-on about two feet off the ground , and went right through it in a huge explosion of flying lumber and deafening noise that did n't even slow them down . Orlean realized numbly that Clair was now speeding into the domain of the mean spotted cow that had eaten her two geraniums . The cow realized it at about the same time . Most cows are not noted for their agility , but this particular situation seemed to be somehow inspiring to this particular cow . As the roaring monster that was half machine and half human lunged toward the stunned , spotted cow , it snorted in absolute horror and leaped high onto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he and his motorcycle flashed beneath the upraised forehooves of the rearing cow , and an instant later he and his cycle crashed wildly on through the other side of the fence . The cow , having performed what was without doubt the most fantastic athletic feat of its life , now became totally petrified and fell down on its side , where it lay without moving hardly at all for a long time . Orlean , seeing all of this action in terms of split-second thoughts , was glad that the spotted cow , mean as it was , had n't been hurt . But still , within that brief fraction of time , she remembered her two destroyed geraniums . And for a fleeting moment , in her imagination , it was n't Clair on a motorcycle charging a mean spotted cow . It was St. George on a great stallion , charging an awful dragon . That cow might think twice before breaking out and coming over here again . But these tiny , swift thoughts took place at almost the same instant that Clair went speeding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the fence , and the overpowering fear in her mind was that he might be seriously hurt , or even dead , by now . She and Wayne broke into a run toward the demolished section of fence as Melva appeared in the door . " He 's okay ! " Wayne yelled with more hope than conviction . " The motor 's still running ! " The engine could be heard receding in the distance , and then , far away , it suddenly sputtered and stopped . Melva ran up to them near the broken fence . " What in the name of heaven ? ? ! " She was about to go on , but Orlean suddenly said , " Shhhh , " and she stayed silent . Then the faint noise Orlean had heard came again . It was the distant sound of the engine coming back to life . She and Wayne looked at each other , and both of them became aware of finally starting to breathe again . Half to himself , Wayne said , " He stopped ' er , an ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have happened , Melva said , " Did he kill the cow ? " " The cow 's not dead , " Orlean said . " ? I think it fainted . " The sound of the motorcycle 's engine was growing now , and a little later Clair swung off the street and drove slowly into the yard . He brought the scratched and dented cycle to a stop near them and shut off the motor , still sitting in the seat . The ugly bruise on his right forehead was nothing compared to the look of immense embarrassment and anguish that had replaced the usual smile on his face . " ? Everything got stuck all at once , " he finally said . Then , with a faint shrug , " ? Damn it t ' hell anyway . " Neither Orlean nor Melva was used to such strong language , but it was n't said in a bad way . To Orlean , forgetting the words , it sounded more like a quiet sigh of distress , a sad recognition of one more problem in what might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | " You 're hurt , " she said . " Your forehead is bruised . " He grinned ruefully . " Long as it 's my head , there ai n't much t ' worry about . ? They say it 's made outta iron . " " Boy , " Wayne put in , " you sure did stick on t ' that there machine . Most riders woulda bailed out , or come off , in the first ten feet . " " Well , somebody had t ' stay aboard an ' find out where it was goin ' . " Clair grinned with a little more feeling . " Otherwise , this cycle coulda wiped out half the community up the street . " " If you 'll come in , " Orlean said , " we can soak that bruise with a cold rag . " " That 's right , " Melva nodded . " At least it 'll maybe cut down the swelling . " " No , but I thank you . " Clair now got off the seat and kicked the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I got ta rope that cow t ' hold it for the time bein ' , and then fix up this fence . " " I 'll go explain what happened t ' Mrs. Sheppick , " Wayne said . " It 's her cow , and she 's kinda deaf or she 'd have already been out here . " Mrs. Sheppick was n't too upset about the fence . It was built so poorly that the cow itself had broken out fairly often , just by backing up and scratching its rump on it . She gave them a hammer and nails from a nearby shed . And by the time dark had settled in , the fence was back in better shape than it had been before , and the spotted cow was on its feet , wandering about in a puzzled fashion . Orlean came out of the house , where she and Melva were fixing supper , as Clair and Wayne were getting ready to go . Standing in the yellow light cast from the kitchen window , she said , " I sure am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm mostly glad that you did n't get hurt too much . " " The bike got hurt worse , " Clair said . " But I can fix it okay . "  | " If the two of you would like to stay for supper , Melva says there 's plenty . " " Well , we sure thank you , but I do n't think so . " " ? A glass of water ? " " No , thanks . " " ? My name 's Orlean . " " I know . " He rolled down his sleeves and started to button them . " Kinda like , ? the city of New Orleans . " " Yes . " He smiled . " When ya come t ' think about it , I guess we both got kinda funny names , somehow . " Again she found herself smiling back at him . " I guess so . " " Well  --  I ' 11 be seein ' ya . " " ? I hope so  --  Clair . " " Next time I make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wood fences t ' do it . " She still was n't quick enough , or yet sure enough of herself , to reply in the same light , casual vein . All she could say was what she meant . " Thanks for bringing the salt . ? And what you did on your bike , before it got out of hand , was really graceful and beautiful . " His infectious grin came across his face again and he said , " You got ta admit that it was that last part that was the real lulu . " And then the grin turned into a low laugh . " Maybe what you said about me before is true . " " What ? " " Slammin ' head-on through fences like that , an ' bein ' a laugh-a-minute , maybe I really could go if work for a circus . " He swung onto the seat and Wayne got on behind him with a small , smiling wave to Orlean . They drove out of the yard and away , and it was only when she could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and went back into the house .  | AL HAD put in a hard shift up at the mine that day , and when he got home after dark he was too tired to be his normal , joking self . He washed up and ate in a heavy , unspeaking silence , and then went straight to bed . Margaret hurried in a few minutes later , after a long session of playing Mah-Jongg with friends , gulped a few quick bites and then dashed off to meet Darrell at the Gem Theater . So it was that Melva and Orlean wound up quietly doing the dishes together , Melva washing and Orlean drying . Finally , Orlean said , " ? Do you like him ? " Melva rinsed a plate before answering . " I would n't want t ' go anyplace on a motorcycle with him . " " But is n't he handsome ? " Melva started washing another plate , studying it with frowning thought . " ? Handsome is as handsome does , honey . " " But he does handsome , too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gravy bowl . " Both him and Wayne are fine-looking young men . ? But Clair strikes me as being maybe , maybe too much of a smooth talker , too much of a slicker for a girl like you , despite those innocent blue eyes of his . " " Him a slicker ? " Orlean smiled at the plate she was drying . " He 's hardly the patent-leather hair and waxed moustache kind . " " I 'm just saying that there 's something more to him , - some-   | thing more experienced about him than the other young men around here . And I do n't want you to be hurt . You been hurt a lot more than enough , already . " " No more than you , Melva , ? or the others . " " Yes , more . Somehow , it 's different with you , little sister . " Melva hung up the washcloth as Orlean finished drying the gravy bowl . Then Melva turned and put her arms around Orlean , hugging her gently to her breast . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way they are in this world , honey . I wish , somehow , that I could just reach in and pull the sadness out of you . " She smiled through suddenly damp eyes . " I 'd be like a dentist pulling a sore tooth . It would hurt like fury for a little while , but then the pain would start to go away . " Orlean returned Melva 's hug warmly , laying her head against her big sister . But her eyes , troubled as they were , were still dry . " I 'm fine , Melva . Please do n't worry about me . " Overcome by her own inner feelings , Melva sniffed slightly , almost half a sob , and was instantly impatient with herself for this . " ? It 's a funny thing , " she said , " I 've been with you all your life . And I 've never , ever seen you cry one tear for anything but joy . " " ? I love you , Melva . " They gave each other a final @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forced a small , wry smile . " I do n't know what , if anything , will ever come of it . But I 'm glad you went downtown for that salt today . At least , whether he 's a slicker or not , you finally said a few words to a young man . " " Only when he slowed down on his bike long enough . " Melva 's smile widened . " Well , we 'd better get some sleep . " And then , " I hope that little scamp Margaret is n't out too late . " At the door to her and Margaret 's small back bedroom ,  | Orlean turned briefly . " About that salt , Melva . ? I know we did n't need it . " Melva shrugged slightly . " A little extra salt can always come in handy . Now you go on to bed , young lady . " When she was finally settled in bed , Orlean turned up the kerosene lamp so that it threw a little brighter light . Then she reached under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept the few treasured things she possessed . Opening it , she took out an ancient , faded red rose that had been pressed long ago in the family bible . Her mother had performed a miracle , many years before , by somehow making that rose grow . Of course , the family had been living in Granger then , which was farther away from the mill , toward Salt Lake . But even there the air was still poisonous , and her mother 's one living rosebush had been such a rare and unique thing that people had come from far around to look at it and admire it . There was a round , smooth pebble from the shore of a lake she 'd once visited . She could hold its cool smoothness in her hand and close her eyes , and feel once again the brisk , fresh breeze from the clear water , see once more the tiny , happy whitecaps running and playing with the teasing winds over the nearly sky-blue surface of the lake . There were a few letters and old Christmas cards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that did n't fit anymore . But now she took out the one thing that she was really looking for in the tin box . It was a slightly creased photograph of her mother and father taken just after they were married . Her father with a quiet gentleness in his strength . And her mother with a quiet strength in her gentleness . And now , though they were still young and alive in Orlean 's  | eyes , they were gone . Father , an oak tree of a man , from an unexpected , totally unbelievable heart attack . And then mother , simply because without him at her side , she had no further wish to live . Gently , Orlean replaced the photo and then put the tin box back under the bed . She turned the kerosene lamp far down , so that it was almost completely out , but not quite . Then she lay back to watch the dim , vague shadows from the lamp playing flickering games of hide-and-seek with themselves on the ceiling above . All right then , Orlean silently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why could n't she be happy-go-lucky and full of easygoing fun and laughter , and silly and carefree like everybody else ? Why could n't she cry ? Though it seemed to her just then that somebody had once said something about , ? tears that sometimes flowed backwards . Maybe hers did . Maybe , in some strange way , she cried backwards . In any case , whatever there was inside of her , it sure did hurt a lot . And why was she such a darned coward ? Ever since she could remember , she 'd sat off on the sidelines , dreading the idea of being suddenly and frighteningly brought to the center of attention . In school she 'd even hated spelling bees , and she was a good speller . She hated school dances , and she was a good dancer . Maybe hate was n't the right word . She did n't actually hate anything . Maybe feared was the word . And in that case , softer words like shy and timid were easier to think of and use . But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind once again , and it made her frown briefly at the shadowed ceiling . Was she afraid of things ? Or was she just , somehow , different ?  | She remembered back to the time when she was ten , and she 'd had a giant windfall of an Indian-head nickel from Uncle Charlie . With one penny or two pennies , you just naturally went to the penny-candy store . But with that much money , a whole nickel all at once , there was only one thing to do . You waited impatiently for Saturday , and then you went to the movie at the then brand-new Gem Theater . Orlean had gone in with a lucky few other kids who happened to also be rich on that particular Saturday night . By the time the movie let out it was already dark , and it was a long , lonely walk home to Shield 's Addition , the cluster of small houses on the far edge of Magna where Orlean lived . On the way up the street some of the other kids started acting foolish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other in the dark . Orlean , just walking along by herself , was suddenly stunned and nearly knocked forward to the ground . As her mind gradually cleared , her ears and head began ringing and beating with shrill , throbbing pain , and she realized numbly that she 'd been hit on the back of the head with a rock . A moment later she knew that it had been a very sharp rock . For when she leaned weakly against a fence and put her hand up to the pounding hurt , the hand came back covered with blood . At no time did she cry out in anger , or for help , or even make any small sound of pain . And soon the other children , unknowing , were long gone in the dark , their shouts and calls fading away in the distance . One slow step after the other , often leaning and resting against a dimly seen fence or a shed along the way , Orlean made her painful way toward Shield 's Addition . By the time she saw the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet . But then , finally , she managed to get to the front of the house .  | And at that time , much of her attitude toward the entire scheme of things that would come to pass in her life and in her world , forever , became very clear in a shy and bittersweet way . Her parents had company . Two Mormon Elders were with them in the lighted parlor , talking about something , making points with the movements of their hands . Orlean could n't disturb these important people , embarrass them with her blood-clotted hair , with the fresh blood that was still seeping down onto the back of her dress . So , in respectful silence and with rapidly fading strength , she made her way around one dark side of the house to the back door . Then , as noiselessly as possible , she went into the unlighted kitchen and sat quietly in a chair at the table . That 's all she remembered until she became dimly aware that she was in her mother 's lap . Her mother was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tune as tears ran down her cheeks . The kitchen was lighted by a lamp now , and her father was standing over her , staring down at her with a face of granite sadness . " Thank God , " he whispered as her eyes opened . " ? There you are . " " Oh , baby , " her mother said , swiftly trying to blink back her tears , " why did n't you cry , or let us know you were hurt ? " " I , ? I just did n't want t ' , be a bother if anybody . " " Bother ? ! " Her mother hugged her so fiercely that it hurt . " You almost bled to death before we found you , " " That shyness of yours , " her father said gently , " is a thing that you 'll have if learn t ' get over . There 's times for boldness , Lean . An ' sometimes even a good loud holler for help ai n't outta line . " Orlean could tell that her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw that she had been dressed in her nightgown . Feeling better here in the warmth and security of her parents , she said , " I 'm sorry , Pa . I just , ? hated t ' disturb you , an ' embarrass you an ' Ma with company . " " You funny little dickens , " her mother said , rocking her gently back and forth in her lap . " You just love so awful much , ? that you ca n't help but put all others before you . And you stand back and quiet , an ' never ever complainin ' , ? even when you 're bleedin ' your life blood out . " Then the little , ten-year-old Orlean had gone off to sleep again , safe in her mother 's arms and her father 's presence . Oh , God , she missed those two , the sixteen-year-old Orlean thought to herself now as she stared at the dim , dancing shadows on the ceiling . Melva married . Margaret , from all signs , about to be . The brothers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , gone off and away somewhere to start their own , distant lives . And what was she , Orlean , to do ? She could n't stay with Melva and Al too much longer . They were willing , and kind , but they had to have freedom for themselves , and for their family that would be coming in time . A recurring dream came to Orlean . Horses . Wild horses . Beautiful beyond belief , thundering by swiftly and silently in her mind . To the best of her memory , she 'd first had this dream when she was five . And it came back to her again and again , each time as vivid and wonderful as before . There was this mystical and magic place far away and high up in the mountains . Not just any mountains , and certainly nothing like that stained and scarred mountain with the mill on it . These mountains were green and fertile , with the songs of birds everywhere , and snow-capped peaks on the distant heights . The valleys were verdant , and filled as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of gay and happy wild- flowers . And above all among these other breathlessly lovely things , there were the majestic wild horses , proud , swift , beautiful and invincible . Sometimes , in her dream , the horses would race right up into the sky , and go galloping across the clouds themselves , as though the clouds were great , white , fluffy fields stretching endlessly and forever in the heavens . There was something else in Orlean 's dream , a mysterious and warm presence that she could never quite see or place . Whatever , or whoever , it was , it was protective and good . But it was always just barely out of sight , somewhere beyond the next hill , or hidden from her view at the far end of a green valley below . Finally this dream took Orlean 's mind away from the sorrow of her mother and father . And , at last , she slept .  | CLAIR DROPPED Wayne off in front of the small Huffaker house , where from behind a few scraggly trees faint light from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Wayne said quietly , " ? You ai n't comin ' in ? " Clair shook his head , his face impassive . " Nah. ? I 'll see ya tomorrow . " Understanding , Wayne nodded and clasped his big brother 's shoulder with brief , strong affection . Then he turned and went toward the house . Clair started to turn his cycle around , but Wayne got to the front door first . From inside the house , a strident female voice could be heard demanding , " Why are you so late ? ! Have you been out galavantin ' around with that brother a ' yours again ? ! " Going easy on the throttle , Clair drove slowly back down the street as quietly as possible , his throat thick with a sad , choked feeling . A few minutes later , he turned off the now fairly wideawake Main Street and parked his bike in an alley behind the three-story Panama Hotel , one of the two largest buildings in Magna . The Panama was a combination hotel , speakeasy and whorehouse . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and finally realized that he just could n't stay at his own home with his own family , he 'd gone looking for a room . And they 'd had  | a small place , not much bigger than a closet , in the back of the Panama Hotel . Big Bertha Pearl , the hugely built owner and proprietess of all three businesses under that roof , had taken a liking to Clair and let him have the tiny room . " What can ya afford for it , kid ? , " she asked , her massive face almost hidden by a headband filled with drooping peacock feathers , and her fat , mottled neck completely hidden by countless overlapping strings of pearls . " Nothin ' . ? Ai n't got a job yet . " She could see that the young man was not apologizing , or backing down , but just stating a simple fact . " Well then , what can ya do ? " He took a long breath , thinking hard . " You got a pool table in the speak downstairs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up poolballs for customers over t ' Park City . " Big Bertha Pearl nodded . " Then you got a nighttime job an ' a room , kid . They work out even . " " What hours , ma'am ? " " About ten t ' twelve . B'fore ten they 're too busy drinkin ' t ' shoot pool , an ' after twelve they 're too drunk t ' see what the hell they're.doin ' anyhow . " She twirled a long loop of pearls idly , frowning at him . " An ' I ai n't no ma'am , kid . I 'm Big Bertha Pearl . " Suddenly unsure of quite how to address this formidable woman properly , Clair simply nodded . Big Bertha Pearl now stood up , all six feet and two hundred pounds of her . She and Clair were on the same eye level , but she outweighed him by at least forty pounds . " Now you 're back in town , kid , why ai n't you stayin ' with your family ? " " It 's , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Nineteen . " " Bullshit ! How old 're you ? "  | His young eyes gathered the strength to match hers . " ? All right , I 'm sixteen . Seventeen pretty quick . " She shook her head ponderously , her strings of pearls shifting slightly with the movement . " Jesus Christ ! I 've gone an ' hired myself a goddamn baby ! You best look someplace else . " Clair said very quietly , " I been known t ' settle a few arguments on them pool tables over t ' Park City . An ' I 'm a hard worker . " Something about the quiet confidence of the young man touched a responsive chord in Big Bertha Pearl . " ? Get your room key from the bartender , an ' ya start t'night . " Then she said , as an afterthought , " ? An ' I guess ya can just call me Big Bertha , if ya want to . " Now , going straight up to his tiny room this night , Clair lay down on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a while , his expressionless eyes wide open . Finally , about nine o'clock , he went across the street to the Tip Top Cafe for a lonely , flavorless chicken-fried steak with hard peas and dry mashed potatoes and a lukewarm glass of milk . And then , promptly at ten , he started racking the pool table at The Smokehouse , the speak in the basement of the Panama Hotel . He worked his full two hours , often hiding an almost angry impatience when his practiced , pool-trained eyes would see half-drunk miners trying the wrong shots , or just plain missing so badly that you could n't even tell what they were shooting at in the first place . The two top bootleggers from around there came in . Old Poison Pete and his fat son , Little Pete . They laughed and joked with some friends at the bar , and they bought drinks for everyone around them . Big Bertha Pearl joined them after a while , and Poison Pete playfully slapped her on the butt , which was sort of like hitting a Mack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A little later on , while Clair was racking up a fresh eight- ball game , Sheriff Pistol Pete walked in and joined the others crowded around the bar . Clair could n't help but think just then that it seemed like damnere everyone in this town was named Pete . One thing for damned certain , he decided in silent , grim humor , was that if the Clairs were matched up for general battle against the Petes , the Clairs would sure as hell be in trouble . There was only one of them in the world , and that was him . Poison Pete wandered over to the pool table and offered everyone there a drink . And in his depressed , half-angry frame of mind , Clair accepted along with the others . Big Bertha Pearl frowned , but she did n't say anything against it . It was Poison Pete 's own booze that he offered around , calling it " simple , good old home brew , " and it tasted to Clair like gasoline with a dash of iodine in it for flavor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyone . " The secret a ' Magna havin ' the best booze in Utah is that the water around the mine here 's so goddamn awful that anything ya do to it 's got ta be an improvement ! " Clair finished two of Poison Pete 's drinks , and then Big Bertha Pearl was at his side . " It 's midnight , " she said , " and your work day 's over . ? Maybe you ought t ' turn in . " With a tongue that suddenly felt like an oily radiator cap , Clair muttered , " ? I think , ? maybe y'r right . " Not only feeling sad and exhausted , but painfully drunk , he finally made it upstairs . Luckily , when he fell down , his room was so small that almost the only place he could hit was the bed . He switched off the bare electric light and lay there in the dark for a long moment . Only then , finally , did he come to grip with his real agony . Not his scratched and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pete 's guaranteedto-kill or die-trying whiskey .  | His real agony had to do with the strident voice he had heard from within the house earlier that evening . Clair was fiercely proud of the pioneers he vaguely knew of way back in his family , those early , brave people who had crossed the Great Plains and mountains to settle in Utah . They were men and women he could understand , respect and finally love , even though the passing of time had made them only dimly seen , powerful figures on a vast , much too quickly disappearing landscape . Some of them had even been descendants of Thomas Jefferson . He guessed , then , that he must be too . His forefathers had plowed the very first furrow that had ever broken into the hard , hostile earth of a Utah field . They had started the first printing press that ever tried to give news and hope and wisdom on a printed page to the struggling people of this new , huge land . In his heart , Clair wished he had been born one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than fifty years too late . And born into a family divided , a family that had put him out before he was quite old enough to even know what being put out meant . His mother , for reasons known only to her , perhaps not even really known to her , had decided that Clair should not be born , long before the moment he was born , the fifth child in a family of seven . Clair 's first memories were painful ones , impossible to understand . The older children , Marvin , Sherril , Ken and Evelyn , would come home from kindergarten and grade school at noon for lunch . Clair was still too young for school . All the children would line up hungrily in the back yard and their mother , Enzy , would give them food , usually sandwiches or soup . And wherever he was standing in line , she would ignore Clair , simply leave him standing there with no  | food and , even worse , no word . Marvin , the oldest boy , quickly became aware of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clair behind the garage and try to share his own food with his little brother . Grateful , Clair had taken one bite of Marvin 's jam sandwich the first time it happened . But with the feelings welling up inside of him , he could hardly choke it down , because his mother had n't just given it to him normally , and with love . And after that , he pretended not to be hungry . Or Clair 's first important school holiday , May Day . That year , as school was coming to an end for the summer , the Huffaker family was a little more solvent than usual because Frank had a steady job , selling paint . So that morning mother Enzy Huffaker gave each child down the line , one after the other , an unheard of fortune of thirty-five cents to spend for candy and rides when the school bus delivered them to Liberty Park in Salt Lake City . She gave each child , even little Wayne , a quarter and a dime . Except that she passed by Clair as though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money . No look . No word . Even at sixteen now , Clair could get choked up with bewildered grief wondering what possessed that strange woman , the woman who more than any other he was supposed to love , and wanted to love . His father , Frank , went almost as much against Clair 's ideals about parents as his mother . Frank was overweight and always tired , a vague dreamer of half-dreams whose ideas were never fully formed , or strong . Enzy , in her harsh voice , would tell him to do everything . And Frank would do it . Or plan vaguely on doing it , depending on the energy he had at the time . He was not an unkind or cruel man , but he would never go  | against her , even though a son of his was for no known reason being systematically crucified . He might ask , " Say , how come ya did n't give little Clair thirty-five cents t'day , like the other kids ? " She would answer something like , " I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! An ' I slave my hands t ' the bone all day long tryin ' t ' raise ' em ! Now do n't you go an ' start tryin ' t ' tell me how t ' do it ! Right now , while you 're standin ' here a ' arguin ' , baby Lois 's screamin ' her lungs out f'r her diaper t ' be changed ! " And even though one-year-old Lois might not be making a sound , Frank would feel overwhelming guilt and distress , plus the deep-rooted fearfulness that all long-married husbands have of easily outraged wives . And he would mumble , " Well , a ' course , ? whatever you say , Enzy dear . " Neither one of them would have remembered such a thing as the thirty-five cents any longer than that . But Clair remembered , and it would n't have been any different in his memory , better or worse , if it had been thirtyfive million dollars . He 'd worked all week after school , cleaning up the garage and pulling weeds in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoping for a nickel or maybe even a dime on May Day . When the school bus had pulled into that magic place that was Liberty Park , right in the middle of Salt Lake City , there 'd been more kids there than Clair had ever seen before in his life , so many that at first little Wayne was afraid to get off the bus . All of the schoolkids from every place in Salt Lake County were there . There were acres and acres of tall , spreading trees and lawn , and every kind of ride in the world to go on for a nickel apiece . There was a big lake with an island in it , and you could go for a ride as a passenger in a speed boat , or even hire and take out your own rowboat all  | by yourself . There was a Ferris-wheel and a Loop-the-Loop , and loud , happy music was booming out from a Merry-GoRound that was whirling dizzily around with gaily painted horses going rhythmically up and down , moving proudly on their gleaming brass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low buildings that smelled good , even from the bus , where you could buy everything from hot dogs to any flavor of soda pop , or cotton candy or popcorn or candied apples . Ken rushed off like he 'd been shot from a cannon , but the other kids stayed near Clair , knowing he had no money and wanting to share with him . Wayne even wanted to give Clair his whole quarter and dime , and then just go around with him . But Clair told them no . " Listen , " he said , " I do n't wanta be stuck with all a ' you hangin ' around with me all day . I 'm goin ' off on my own , an ' I 'll meet ya back here at the bus . " And then he turned around and quickly lost himself in the thronging crowds of other school children . At first he was still feeling so sad and hollow-chested that he could n't pay much attention to anything , but just walked on and on , unseeing among the laughing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long time , he finally willed himself to stop feeling sorry for himself and start paying attention to the things that were around him . And he found that there were many things at Liberty Park that were free . There were the beautiful trees and grass , that were unlike anything in Magna . You could sit by the lake , and put your hands in it . There was a huge house with joining squares of clear glass for a roof , where the sun could shine through , and inside were hundreds and hundreds of plants and flowers that he 'd never seen before , or even imagined . And best of all there was a zoo that you could walk  | through without having to pay any money . There were all kinds of birds in it , plus foxes and deer , coyotes and wolves , all in their separate cages . At the far end , there was even a big , brown bear lazing in the sun . Later in the day , Sherril and Wayne finally found him there by the bear cage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holding a partly melted vanilla ice cream cone . " We been lookin ' all over for ya , " Sherril said . " We brought ya this vanilla cone . " " Yeah , " Wayne said . " You must be starvin ' by now . " Sherril thrust the melting cone forward in such a way that ( : lair had to take it , but he just held it in front of him . " Ai n't ya gon na eat it ? " Wayne asked . " Ya better , " Sherril told him , " ' cause we sure ai n't . " " Ya ai n't ? " Clair turned toward the cage and held the cone out . " Hey , you , come ' ere . " The big bear lumbered toward the offered cone , and Clair threw it between the bars so that it landed on some grass near t he bear 's forepaws . With a few throaty rumbles and great delight , the big bear laid down with the cone in its forepaws and started to lick at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the happy beast to Clair with puzzled frowns , so Clair said , " Somehow , I just do n't feel hungry . " Even now , lying in the Panama Hotel only half-awake and with a head that felt like it had been hit with a sledgehammer , Clair was fiercely proud that it was the bear who had got the last nickel 's worth that had ever almost come to him from the tight , pinched face and purse of his mother . Ever since that me he 'd never accepted anything from either his mother or lather , and in his entire life he never would . As a child after  | that May lay , half starving , and with flapping , hole-worn shoes , he 'd tried to run away three or four times . But he was still too young to be taken seriously by anybody , and always some well-meaning person would haul him back to his " home " where Enzy would scream senselessly or slap him while his father mumbled unheard words of advice . The first and only time he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very thinly and told him that she and his father had decided to curb his rebellious ways by sending him to live with relatives in Wyoming . Clair thought briefly of those many times and many places he 'd known since he was first sent away at about the age of seven . They included Evanston , Wyoming , Salt Lake City , and a dozen points in between . But , unexpectedly and beautifully , almost everyone he 'd stayed with had been warm and wonderful to him . Big , fat , loving Aunt Maine . Quiet , uncannily wise Mrs. Legget . And the iron matriarch with the warm sparkle in her eye , Grandma Brown . He 'd always managed to earn his own way , though , wherever he 'd been . Working at jobs ranging from sweeping out stores to lumberjacking . They had turned out to be good , rich experiences . But what with moving around a lot it had n't been an endless piece of cake , especially with that damned name , Clair . Everybody thought it was a girl 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got into ! From Logan to Park City , from Ogden to Strawberry , from Murray clear up to Big Piney . And he was almost always outnumbered , too , just naturally being a loner . There was that running feud with those four tough Mexican kids up in Ogden who decided that they were going to cut him up or kill him . Luckily , when they 'd come upon him in the alley behind where he was going part-time to school , he 'd been prepared . He went among them with a pair of brass knuckles recently acquired from a pawn shop on South Street for a  | dollar-fifty . The knucks had been a good investment , for the first kid he got a good swing at on the jaw , dropped his knife and went down like he 'd been hit with a crowbar . When he leaped back up , his hand on his jaw , blood was spurting like a fountain from his mouth and nose . He 'd rushed off blindly , half-yelling something in Mexican , and the other three followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad . It was only when they had all disappeared down the alley that Clair realized he himself had been cut on his left side and was bleeding too . Another couple of inches in , and he might have been dead . Ile still had that dropped knife , the kind with one long blade that flipped open when you pushed a small button on its side . He kept it next to his brass knuckles in his duffle bag . About a month later he 'd been sent to Salt Lake for the summer , and there he 'd seen the most impressive man he 'd ever known . The man was visiting Grandma Brown and way , way back in time he had been an older friend of Clair 's Grandpa . Clair could n't remember his name , as a mere boy was more than likely never even introduced . But what a big , rugged barn-door of a man ! He had to be well over seventy years old , and he had to weigh nearly two hundred and fifty pounds , yet he still had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light that it looked like he could have jumped clear up into the sky if he 'd wanted to . And his hands ! Big , gnarled branches of wrists ending in wide , hardworked and a thousand-times-hurt fingers . Fingers that had become more and more powerful and beautifully lined with every hard piece of work , and with every hurt . Finally that night , the old giant of a man looked at Clair with those eagle eyes of his and said very quietly , " ? Your Grandpa was one fine man , son . "  | Then he stood up , touched Clair 's shoulder with a massive , gentle hand , and was soon gone , forever . Thinking all of his thoughts about the people , places and times in his life , and wishing not for what was , but for what ought to be , Clair at last went to sleep .  | Two NIGHTS later business was slow at The Smokehouse , and Bull Barstow , boss of the bull gang up at the mill , came over to the pool table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he grumbled . " How ' bout you ? " " I just work here . " " Ai n't nothin ' doin ' anyhow . Say , four bits a game ? " " That 's pretty steep . " " Two bits then . " " Well , I guess one game would n't hurt . " Shortly after midnight , Clair knocked at the door of Big Bertha Pearl 's office and went in . She looked up from some work on her desk and said , " Yeah ? " " Bull Barstow asked me t ' play some pool . " " Well , why not ? It 's quieter'n a Mormon 's confession 1t'night . " " ? I won five dollars off ' im . " " Five bucks ? ! " Big Bertha Pearl studied him for a moment . " You ai n't a hustler ? " " No . Just a pretty good shooter . " " How come ya did n't just pocket the money an ' keep your mouth shut ? " " ? I was on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yours . " " You 're crazy . You won it . "  | " Sure is easy money . " She shrugged . " Ai n't no such thing as easy money , finally . " " Sure seems like it right now . " " ? You wan na shoot sometimes , on slow nights ? " Clair grinned , " If it 's okay , you bet ! " " Okay . But do n't never murder the customers . An ' do n't never bet on the come with money you ai n't got . " That night marked the beginning of some of the happiestgo-lucky , carefree months Clair had ever known . In any given week he never did worse than break even . And nine times out of ten he 'd wind up with some extra dollars , each one seeming the size of a giant , shiny cartwheel , because for the first time in his life he could just up and spend it any old way that he happened to want to , without even thinking twice about it . But he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first windfall from Bull Barstow . The next Sunday , his day off at the grocery store , he drove into Salt Lake with Sherril in his brother 's new Ford Model A Sedan . It was a gloriously warm and sunny day in Salt Lake , and they drove with the canvas top down , the engine tooling along smoothly . " How ' bout if we drive on up t ' The Laughing Lady for a drink or two ? " Sherril suggested . " Good idea . " " Just t ' help stave off the sunstroke , a ' course . " " Boy , " Clair said , fingering the car 's polished dashboard idly and watching some people cross the wide street before them as Sherril stopped for a signal , " this sure is the life . " " It damn sure is . " Sherril took a long , deep breath . " Like bein ' right in the middle a ' that big old Big Rock Candy Mountain itself . " " Well , " Clair grinned , " I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settle for a Lucky Strike ? "  | " Sure will . " Sherril drove on , as Clair lighted up for the two of them . It was dusk when they got back to Magna , and Sherril stopped to drop Clair off in front of Melva and Al 's house . Clair got out with a large brown paper bag under one arm , and started toward the house as Sherril drove away . Clair knocked at the back door and a moment later Melva , still in her go-to-meeting church clothes , answered it . " Well , hello there . " " Evenin ' , ma'am . ? Is Orlean home ? " " We just got back . " Melva raised her voice a little , " It 's for you , ' Lean . " Melva stepped away from the door and Orlean appeared in a pretty yellow and white dress , her eyes widening when she saw who it was . " ? Hello . " And then , " ? Wo n't you come in ? " " No , thanks . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands . " Not groceries this time . Just somethin ' I thought you might like . " She said numbly , " ? Something , ? for me ? " " Yeah . Here , I 'll help ya get it out , but be careful . " She stepped to him and in a moment was holding the gift , staring at it speechlessly . It was a clay pot with four beautiful , already full-grown red geraniums planted in it . All she could finally manage to say was , " ? How , ? could you know ? " Not too sure what she meant , he grinned and shrugged . " Well , that one ya had when I was here b'fore was almost a goner . " " ? You saw it . " From the doorway Melva said , " Those are real , real nice . ? Do you two want t ' sit in the parlor awhile , and talk ? " " No , thanks , " Clair said .  | Orlean put the flowers down , very gently , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd , sort of like to take a little walk . ? If you would . " " Sure . That 'd be swell . " Out of habit with Margaret , Melva almost said , " Do n't be too late . " But instead she said , " ? You both have a nice time , " and closed the door . Quietly strolling through the growing darkness toward Main Street , Orlean said , " No matter how long I live , Clair , I 'll never forget you bringing me those flowers . " " I wish I coulda had ' em wrapped in colored paper , but that place in Salt Lake only had paper bags . " Then he said , " Sure is a nice night for a walk . " " I 'll bet you 've seen all kinds of nights , all over . " " Well , a few . ? I 'm workin ' nights at The Smokehouse , you know . " " That saloon ? " " Speakeasy . It 's not the kind a ' place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No . But any place you liked , I bet I would too . " They were at Main Street now , with its long line of bright lights leading to the dark mountain beyond . " Would you like to go to Turk 's Drugstore for an ice cream ? " Clair asked . " I 'd like that . " Even though the town was in a roaring mood tonight , with big miners crowding the sidewalks and loud laughter , shouting and music blaring from every other doorway , Orlean felt safe and protected with Clair . Instead of an ordeal it was suddenly , somehow , an adventure . They ordered two dishes of vanilla ice cream at Turk 's , and sat in wire-backed chairs at a tiny table to eat it . " How long have you had your , ? Indian ? " she asked , not being able to imagine him ever not having it .  | " About three months . I got a great deal on it from a friend of mine who 's in the state penitentiary now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He held up a gas station . They caught him on his cycle , that Indian , about four blocks away . " Orlean took another bite of ice cream . " I 've read in the magazines about getaway cars . But never about getaway motorcycles . " Clair grinned . " I 'd been savin ' every penny I could to buy a cycle , even goin ' without eating t ' help put a little bit aside . He knew about that , so on his way t ' the pen , he let me have it for the forty-five dollars I 'd saved . He was n't too bad a guy . " Carried along by sincere curiosity , she said , " Have , ? have you ever been in jail ? " Clair laughed . " No . " She was instantly embarrassed by her question , but then Clair asked , " Have you ? " and she started laughing along with him . On the walk back home , Orlean said , " Sometime , would you like to come over and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm not too much on those family sort of things . " " Oh . " " Ya see , I been kinda on my own , all those different places , for nearly ten years . " " It must have been exciting . But , did n't you miss your family ? " " Oh , I guess so , sort of , once in a while . " He added proudly , " But all my big brothers 're doin ' real fine . An ' my big sister , too . Evelyn 's turned out if be a real beauty , an ' I got a hunch you two 'd be good friends in nothin ' flat . " " Wayne 's real nice , a lot like you . Tell me about the others . " " Marvin 's married an ' moved up if Canada on a real good  | job . He 's practically a college graduate in electricity . Builds power plants . An ' Sherril 's just married . He 's a top electrician up at the mill . Right now Ken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he 'll straighten out . " " ? And Evelyn ? " The tone of pride in Clair 's voice became even greater . " Would you believe it , I introduced her to Miles , her husband . " " That 's nice . " " Miles is even older than Evelyn , about twenty-three or so , and we got t ' be friends in Salt Lake last year . So one time when Evelyn came in t ' spend the day , I got them t'gether . " He smiled half to himself . " I just knew they 'd hit it off . " They were at the front of her house now and Orlean turned , smiling back at him in the dim moonlight . " That must make you feel really good . " " Yeah , it sure does . " " ? Well , ? " " I 'll see ya up to the door . " " Thank you . " " Say , " he said as they crossed the dark yard , " you doin ' anything special , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started beating strongly , but she tried to seem as casual as possible . " Do you mean , Sunday after next ? " " Yeah . " " Well , that day , there 's just church , that 's all . " " I got ta warn ya it might go on kinda late . Some of us ' re goin ' out t ' the Salt Palace Pavillion by Smelter Town . " Turning toward him at the door , Orlean felt her heart acting up so much that she was almost afraid Clair would hear its loud beating . " The Salt Palace ? ! " He nodded . " A big place out t'ward the Great Salt Lake . " " Oh , I know ! " She added uncertainly , " It 's just that I 've never ever been there . "  | " Me neither , " Clair shrugged . " But Sherril an ' Miles have , lots of times , an ' we 're all goin ' out cause it 's Sherril 's wife 's birthday . " He hesitated . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , yes ! " " Good . " He smiled and put out his hand . She slowly put her own small hand in his , and he pressed it firmly but gently for a moment , then softly released it . " Well , good night . " " Good night , Clair . " He turned , rather quickly , and walked away with long strides into the dark . When the sounds of his footsteps could no longer be heard , she leaned down and touched the geraniums on the step briefly and gently . Then she opened the door and went in . Melva , Al and Margaret were all at the supper table , and her place was set and waiting for her . " Guess what ? ! " she said , letting loose of some of the excitement within her . " Clair asked me to go to the Salt Palace with him ! " " Wow ! " Margaret said . Orlean looked at Melva . " It 's okay , is n't it ? " " I 've heard that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " ? But of course it 's okay , honey , if you want to . " " I sure do ! " As Orlean sat down and started to put some food on her plate , Al said in a slightly teasing way , " He sure must have real fancy ways , that young man a ' yours . " Orlean could n't stop her cheeks from reddening . " He 's not my young man , ' Al . " " Do n't be too sure a ' that , " Margaret said with intense sincerity . " Darrell 's been my steady beau for five whole months an ' we sure ai n't never been out t ' the Salt Palace Pavillion ! Besides , ' Lean , Melva told me all about them pretty new flowers out on the doorstep . " Al looked up from eating , delighted at this new ammuni- tion . " Flowers ? He brung ya flowers ? ! Was this here dandy by any chance wearin ' spats an ' a silk top hat ? " " Now you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big bully , " Melva said . Later , when Orlean and Margaret were just about to go to bed , Al could n't resist one parting shot . " You know what the man says , ' Lean . It 's okay for a young couple t ' go for a walk t'gether at night , ? as long as they do n't go too far . " And as usual , it was he who burst into loud laughter at his own joke . " Oh , you , Al ! " But Orlean was grinning slightly as she disappeared quickly into the back bedroom . When Melva and Al were alone in the kitchen , he said quietly , " Ya know , honey . T'night 's the first time I ever recall seein ' little ' Lean smilin ' like that . ? Sure is nice . " Melva looked at him warmly . " With all your bluff , an ' corny jokes , ? I guess you 're not the worst husband a girl ever had . " Late the next night Sherril came into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joked with the bartender as he got a drink at the bar , called a happy hello to Big Bertha Pearl , and then took his drink over to the pool table where Clair was racking a game of nine ball . As the players started shooting he said to Clair , " Well , how 'd them posies go over ? " It took Clair a thoughtful moment to quietly answer . " ? It was like , ? well Sherril , you 'd a ' thought I 'd brought ' er the Taj Mahal , ' r somethin ' . " Sherril grinned and said dryly , " I take it she liked ' em okay . " " More'n that . I swear I thought she was almost gon na cry . But after a minute she was okay , an ' we took a little walk . " Sherril took a sip of his drink and made an exaggerated face at the taste of it . " Ya ask her ? "  | Clair nodded . " She said yes . " " That 's sure gon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - tootin ' night , Clair . An ' with her bein ' a little Mormon girl from Magna , ya think she 'll be up t ' that kind of a hot old time , without cryin ' for her momma , or wantin ' t ' go home ? " " She ai n't got no momma , " Clair said , his voice suddenly hard . " An ' it seems t ' me that we 're from Magna , too , Sherril . " Sherril , who lived on fun and laughter and could never stand the idea of hurting anyone , was immediately and painfully sensitive to Clair 's changed tone of voice . " Hey , hold on there , kid brother ! It 's just that it 's gon na be a real special night , an ' I sure do want for you t ' have the best good time that ya can . " " Yeah , I shoulda known that , " Clair said , his quiet voice becoming warm again , soothing Sherril 's hurt feelings . " ? I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a way , she seems t ' be scared a ' her own shadow . But underneath , I got a feelin ' she has more grit , maybe , than both you an ' me put t'gether . " Relieved , Sherril grinned . " Hell , havin ' more grit than me 's the easiest thing in the world . " He finished his drink and said cheerfully to the pool table at large , " What am I wastin ' time here with all you ugly bastards for , when I got that gorgeous redhead a ' mine waitin ' for me with a drink up at home ? " A couple of shooters said things like , " You lucky devil , " and " If she gits tired a ' your homely kisser , send ' er down here . " Clair said , " Give Vivianne my best , " and then Sherril was gone . Toward the middle of the next week Melva came into Swenson 's and ordered a supply of groceries to be delivered . Clair put that delivery off until the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as he was putting the last of the two big bags into the  | wire basket behind Swenson 's bike , Wayne came to the back door giving out onto the alley and said , " Want me if go along with ya ? " " No , thanks . " " Okay . " Disappointed in not being able to go with his big brother , Wayne started to take off the long white apron he wore in the store . As Clair began to pedal away , he called , " See ya in the mornin ' , " and Clair waved back at him , then turned out of Wayne 's sight on Third East . When she heard the faint thumping sound at the kitchen door a few minutes later , Orlean somehow knew that it was Clair , and she hurried to open it . Melva had n't ordered eggs that day , so he only held a large bag in each arm , and there was no sack between his teeth . He smiled and said , " Glad if see no broom , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurried to clear a few things off the table so that he would have enough room to put the heavy bags down . After he 'd put them on the table he turned to her , taking off his cap . " Well , that 's a relief . ? That 's the last delivery I got . " " It is ? " " Yep . " He hesitated . " Means , I 'm kinda off work now , ? for a little while , anyway . " Equally hesitant , Orlean said , " ? Oh , ? well . " And then , almost without thinking , she blurted out , " Would you like a cup of coffee ? " " Coffee ? ! " Clair realized he 'd overreacted , so he shrugged , trying to cover up his surprise . " ? You got any , here in this house ? " " Oh , yes . " Orlean was sudderly aware that she could n't implicate Melva or Margaret , so she added as casually as she could , " I keep it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just as long as the others , ? do n't know . "  | " Well . ? In that case , sure . I 'd like nothin ' better'n a good cup a ' coffee . " A kettle of water was already hot on the stove and Orlean , who 'd made at most a dozen forbidden cups of coffee in her life , could n't help but be pleased with herself by somehow remembering and knowing the two main questions about coffee . " Milk ? " she asked proudly , " ? sugar ? " " Black , thanks , " Clair said . That was a relief . Orlean would n't have ever been able to guess how much of either to put in . Over their two cups of coffee , she finally said , " Clair , do you know , ? what the other girls will be wearing to the Salt Palace Pavillion ? " Clair shook his head . " No . " She toyed with her cup a moment , and then she said quietly , " ? You must know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Salt Lake and all . " " Well , " Clair said , flattered , " I guess I do know a few . " " What I mean is , ? if you wanted , ? to change your mind about taking me ? " Clair thought about that for a moment , perplexed , and then he suddenly grinned and frowned at her at the same time . " I 'm takin ' you , Orlean , and you can wear a tent for all I care . Now is that fairly clear ? " " ? Yes , Clair . " Later , while she was rinsing the coffee cups out , Clair wandered into the front parlor . In one corner , next to the sofa , there was a beaten old guitar leaning against the wall . She came into the parlor then , and he said , " Does anyone play that ? " " I do , " she said . " But not much . " " Could ya , ? play somethin ' ? " " Gee , I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touched it in ages . " She picked the guitar up and touched the strings singly  | and thoughtfully , adjusting the tuning knobs slightly to make the sound right . " I guess I could try , anyway . " Uncertain at first , and then with growing confidence , she started to pick out chords . And finally she began to play , with simple , quiet feeling , " I 'll Take You Home Again Kathleen , " humming the tune in a soft , low voice . She 'd almost finished the song when there were the sounds of approaching voices in the yard , and hearing them she stopped abruptly . " Nothin ' I ever heard ever sounded nicer , " he said . " I always have liked that Kathleen ' song a lot . " She smiled , leaning the guitar back in the corner . " I 'm glad . I always have , too . " Melva and two older , primly dressed church ladies came in the front door as Orlean opened the back , kitchen door for Clair . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said as he went out . A moment later Melva came into the kitchen to make some cocoa for her guests . " Comin ' up t ' the house , I thought for a minute I heard some music . " " I was playing a song for Clair . " Melva got the box of cocoa down from the cupboard . " I was beginnin ' t ' think you 'd never again pick up that old guitar . ? Get me the sugar bowl , will you ? "  | ON SUNDAY , for the first time she could remember , Orlean did n't go to church . Neither the morning nor the evening meeting . She was too busy finishing the new dress she was making , fighting against the seven o'clock deadline while the hands of the clock on the kitchen shelf suddenly seemed to be twirling around as fast as a spinning top . And Melva and Margaret , because of staying to help her , were late even before they started out for the evening meeting . But Orlean was ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands came to a complete stop , now not seeming to move at all . Finally she went into the parlor to sit and wait , her hands folded in her lap . After four or five minutes that were more like four or five hours , there was the sound of a light step on the front porch and a soft knock at the door . For a brief moment , as she hurried to the door , the terrifying thought occurred for the first time to Orlean that they might , just possibly might , be going on Clair 's motorcycle . And the way she was dressed she could n't last on a motorcycle for fifty feet . Opening the door she was immediately relieved to see a sedan parked in the dark before the house , its headlights on and its engine idling quietly . And then Clair stepped into the door 's light . He was wearing dark blue pants and a black jacket , with a gleaming white shirt topped by a dark blue bow tie . The tie was slanted at about the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his leather cap , and it looked much better that way to her , somehow , than if it had been stiffly and properly straight . From Clair 's point of view , he could n't help but think for a fleeting moment that he 'd never before seen the young woman now standing in the doorway . Orlean 's long dark hair was parted in the middle and fell in soft , waterfall waves to her shoulders , gently framing her face and making her wide brown eyes seem even larger , and faintly , heart-tuggingly wistful . She wore a long , simple white dress with a white knitted shawl over her shoulders . And the single color offsetting the white was a long , happy , yellow silk scarf that was loosely tied around her neck , its two ends falling gracefully before her down to below her waist . " Well , " he said , smiling and groping for the right words , but not being able to find them , " ? I see ya decided against wearin ' a tent . " Her welcoming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you are a knockout ! " Her smile returned , wider than before . " I 'm all ready . " " Let 's go . " He shut the front door as she stepped out , then took her elbow to help her to the car . He opened the car door for her to get in , then closed it carefully and went around to get in the driver 's side . As he put the car in gear and started up the street she said , " This is a beautiful automobile . " " It 's Sherril 's . We 're all gettin ' t'gether over at his place . " Then , after a moment , he said , " Listen , Orlean . " " Yes ? " " There 'll be a big crowd at the Pavillion , an ' lots of drinkin ' an ' smokin ' an all , t'night . But I only want you t ' do what ya feel like , an ' not t ' do what ya do n't feel like . " He paused . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't like , just remember that you 're with me. "  | " ? I 'll remember . " A short time later , Clair pulled to a stop before a well-kept house that was freshly painted and had a new white picket fence around it . He helped Orlean from the car and to the front door where a pretty , orange electric light fixture was turned on . Clair knocked but did n't wait for an answer , opening the door for Orlean to go in . She entered and Sherril raised a glass toward her from behind a curved bamboo bar in one corner . " Welcome ! " he smiled . " Come on in an ' make yourself comfortable ! " Wayne and a pretty young girl about his age were seated on a sofa , and as Wayne stood up a little shyly , Sherril said , " I 'm Sherril Huffaker , Orlean . I 've seen you downtown a couple a ' times , but we never met . You know Wayne , an ' that big dummy comin ' in b'hind ya @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Hunter . She 's been puttin ' up with Wayne , off an ' on , for nearly a month now . " Orlean and Guila smiled at each other , and at that moment Vivianne came breezing swiftly out of the kitchen , a drink in one hand and a plate of finger sandwiches in the other . She was a stunning , willowy redhead who exuded good nature and happiness . She was wearing an elegant green dress unlike any that Orlean had ever seen , with shiny silver sequins across the bodice , and a narrow slit that went up to her knee on one side of the skirt . Orlean had heard somewhere that she was from one of the big cities in the state of California , and she probably knew all about the most up-to-date fashions . " You 're Orlean and I 'm Vivianne , " she said , hurrying to put the plate of food on the bamboo bar . " We 're really glad you 're coming with us ! " " Happy birthday , Vivianne , " Orlean said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! From now on I swear I 'm kissin ' out birthdays ! Here Orlean , let me put your shawl in the bedroom . "  | " What 're you two drinkin ' ? " Sherril asked . " Oh , nothing for me , ? yet , " Orlean said . " I 'll take a gin an ' grapefruit juice , " Clair told him . As they sat down on a matching sofa facing the one Wayne and Guila were seated on , Orlean tried not to be too obvious about how interested she was in the unusual furnishings . Almost everything , including the window drapes , seemed to be done in red velvet . Even the soft , deep carpeting on the floor was a rich rust-red . A lamp on the end table near her was particularly fascinating . The lampshade continually , slowly rotated on its base , and the turning shade , with the light within it , was painted all around in different , colorful , forest-fire scenes . So if you looked at it long enough , it actually seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with living flames burning and silently roaring through the painted trees . Vivianne came back in and Orlean said , " Your parlor is just lovely , Vivianne . " " Thanks . " Then with an infectious laugh Vivianne said , " We 're trying our best to make it so modern we can start calling it a living room ! " Sherril brought Clair his drink and Vivianne said , " I might as well take another one , especially since I 've sworn off ever again having another birthday . " " Guess outta pure loyalty I got ta join m ' bride . " Sherril went back behind the bar to start the new drinks . " If you 're gon na keep bringin ' up your birthday like that , " Clair said , " I guess we might as well give ya your present . " He took a small package tied with a ribbon from his pocket . " This is from Wayne an ' me . " Wayne gave him a quick glance , which Clair ignored . " An ' it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' make sure there 's a lot of love with it . " Smiling and excited , Vivianne took the small package . " Oh , thank you ! All of you ! " She untied the ribbon quickly and  | opened it . " It 's gorgeous ! " she exclaimed , taking out a red , enameled pin that was a tiny replica of a ballet dancer . " Well , everything else around here is red , " Clair grinned . " And Sherril 's one big fear is that you just might dance ' im t ' death . " " I 'll wear it tonight ! It 'll be perfect on my green dress . " Sherril handed Vivianne 's drink to her across the bamboo bar . " Somebody might mistake ya for a Christmas tree . " There was another knock on the door and Miles and Evelyn arrived from Murray , carrying a big , pink-ribboned bottle of champagne for Vivianne . " The damn stuff is supposed t ' be imported from France , " Miles said gruffly . " But it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Salt Lake , " Evelyn laughed . As introductions were being made , Orlean began to feel more and more out of place . This was a sophisticated , worldly and unutterably handsome group . Both Clair and young Wayne could easily be mistaken for matinee idols . And Miles and Sherril were finely dressed , prosperous , good-looking men . But Evelyn ! With a sister like her , what would Clair ever be able to see in any other girl ? Vivianne was really stunning in a colorful , flamboyant way , but Evelyn was a true beauty , a dark-haired , dark-eyed princess whose every move and every look was filled with regal grace . She had on a classic , simple black dress with just the right amount of her throat showing to wear one perfect strand of large pearls . But then , when she and Evelyn were introduced , Evelyn came quickly over and hugged her warmly . " I 'm so glad to know you , Orlean . " Orlean found herself saying , and meaning it , " ? I 'm glad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Me an ' Guila got t ' be goin ' , or we 'll be late  | for the movie . Anyway , Vivianne , we just stopped by t ' wish ya happy birthday . " " I want to thank both of you for the pin . " " Well , ? " Wayne hesitated . " It was mostly from Clair . " Shrugging , Clair said , " It 's equal , from all of us . " Wayne and Guila left , and Vivianne said , " We 'll save the champagne for the Salt Palace , but before we go , let 's have one more dash of liquid poison from behind our new bamboo bar . " She smiled at Sherril . " It 's his birthday present to me . " " It really adds to the room , " Evelyn said . " Hell , " Miles snorted , " any bar really adds t ' any room . " " It 's Hawaiian , " Vivianne told them . " Just like they have over there on the beaches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seven dollars a month it costs f'r the next fifty years . " Sherril grinned . " But it sure was a hard hardship comin ' up with that two-dollar cash downpayment . " This time around , Orlean accepted a grapefruit juice , just to have something in her hand , and she noticed that Evelyn only took a tiny bit of gin in hers . Half kidding , Miles said , " Why do n't we take my Packard instead of your Ford , Sherril , an ' go first class ? " But Sherril could n't be baited . He thumped his fist on the bar and said , " Right ! Nothin 's too good f'r Vivianne on her birthday ! We 'll go in your fancy goddamned gold chariot ! " They all got into Miles ' big Packard sedan some time later , and it was after nine o'clock before they at last drove up to the brilliantly lighted entrance to the huge Salt Palace Pavillion beyond Smelter Town . From the rising mountain ground here , as they got out of the car they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dully in the moonlight at a far , dim distance to the north . There were more cars parked here than Orlean had ever thought existed . Long , unending row upon row of cars  | stretched out before them and to both sides until they were lost to sight in the far darknesses around the brightly lighted area . Clair took her hand in his and they walked with the others up a gravel path to the wide stairs leading to the front door . There was a big , hard-faced man in front of the door , but he recognized Sherril and Miles , and waved them all inside with a small , pleasant bow of his head . Orlean had never been in such a gigantic place . There seemed to be , and maybe were , thousands of people swarming about in the huge ballroom , a great many of them laughing and talking at crowded tables , and many others swaying back and forth under a massive chandelier hanging over the dance floor at the other end of the great room , that seemed to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even beyond the dancers under the chandelier , there was a large orchestra playing loud , blaring music that managed impossibly to carry clear to the front door where Orlean could make out vaguely that they were playing " There 's Yes Yes in Your Eyes . " Vivianne , happy and laughing , seemed to know a great many people there , and as they were led to a table she waved the be-ribboned bottle of champagne she 'd brought , and called out gay greetings to friends along the way . The head waiter seated them at a table near a window and not too close to the dance floor . " This table 's a hot decision , " Vivianne approved . And then , to Orlean , " Last time Sherril brought me here we were right by the orchestra , and much as I like music , you could n't hear yourself think . I was almost sittin ' in the drummer 's lap ! " " From the looks he was givin ' ya , " Sherril grinned , " he would n't have minded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take their orders . " Set-ups before dinner ? " he asked .  | " Would you like ginger ale ? " Clair asked Orlean . " Or a juice ? " " Orange juice , I think , " she said . A little later the waiter came back with their set-ups and a silver bucket of ice on a stand to chill Vivianne 's champagne . Orlean was n't sure just what a set-up was , but now it became clear as Clair , Sherril and Miles all took out pocket flasks . The set-up was whatever mix each person wanted served with ice in a glass . Then hard liquor was added from a flask to complete the drink . Clair put his flask out on the table and said , " This is from Big Bertha Pearl 's own private stock of home brew , if anybody wants t ' try some of it . " Sherril said , " You got yourself a customer . Her private stuff 's the best booze in Utah . " " Sounds good to me , " Vivianne smiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Evelyn 'll stick t ' this Scotch . " The two men poured whiskey for themselves and their women , and then Sherril handed Clair back his flask . Clair looked at Orlean , and his question came out sounding more like a statement . " You do n't want any a ' this , do ya ? " She smiled and shook her head . " I think I 'll wait and have some champagne , later , for Vivianne 's birthday . " Clair nodded , starting to pour some whiskey into his ginger ale . " That 's a real fair deal . " " You bet it is , " Vivianne laughed , both her voice and laughter starting to be just a little on the giddy side . " Everybody 's got to at least taste it , since I 've sworn off birthdays forever . " Evelyn raised her glass . " Here 's to a hundred more , " she smiled , " but we 'll keep every one of them a secret . " Vivianne clicked her glass lightly against Evelyn 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tonight , " she giggled , " I just might wind up drinkin ' a toast if each and every one of those next hundred years ! " Then with a quiet look at Sherril , she added , " ? And to spendin ' every one of them with this good man . " At her sudden , unexpected and touching change in mood , there was a warm , silent moment that was felt and shared by everyone at the table . " Hell ! " Sherril finally said . " Up if now I did n't plan t ' live all that long . " He stood up , putting his hand out toward Vivianne . " But if we are goin ' to , we better start gettin ' in shape right now . " " I do believe he 's asking me to dance ! " " An ' nobody in history ever had if ask you twice . " She stood up , her hand in his , and they made their way through the tables toward the dance floor . As they got there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And then , as the leader now started shaking his baton in swift , jerking movements , they began a fast , ear-splittingly loud version of " Ai n't We Got Fun ! " The dance floor erupted in wild movement , and Clair frowned , trying to keep track of Sherril and Vivianne in the frantic crowd . " Boy , if they flap their arms around much faster , " he said , " they may take off just like birds , an ' fly right up if the roof ! " But in the suddenly booming roar of music , no one heard him . So he and Miles shrugged at each other , and they both refreshed their drinks . Evelyn leaned over close to Orlean and said , " I 've been wanting to get a chance to tell you , that I just love your dress . " " Oh , " Orlean smiled , " I 'm so glad ! I just did n't know what to wear ! And Clair was n't too much help . He said I could wear a tent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That sounds like him , " Evelyn laughed . " But whatever he says , tents are definitely out this season . " She touched the end of the sleeve of Orlean 's white dress . " Did you make this yourself ? " Uncertain thoughts rushed swiftly through Orlean 's mind . She was still not at all sure of herself , and still overwhelmed at being here for the first time in the elegant Salt Palace Pavillion . And she would rather lie down and die on the spot than in any way embarrass Clair . Perhaps embarrass him by having not had , and having to make , her own dress for such an important night , and then saying so to this worldly , absolute beauty who was Clair 's older sister . But then she also remembered what Clair had said , about above all her being with him . " ? Yes , I made it . " She smiled and added , " As a matter of fact , I just finally finished it about fifteen minutes before Clair came to get me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Evelyn touched the sleeve of Orlean 's dress , gently , one more time . " It 's much too nice to have been bought at a store . " Then she smiled and said , " I made this dress that I 'm wearing , too . ? Do you like it ? " " I really do , Evelyn . And wearing it with those pearls , I think it 's the prettiest thing I 've ever seen . " They spoke more , suddenly sisters themselves in a quiet way , and Orlean learned that Miles owned trucks and equipment and a gravel pit that helped to make roads all through Salt Lake County . Then , a little breathless , Sherril and Vivianne rejoined them . The menu at the Salt Palace Pavillion was a long , woundup roll of paper that you had to pull down on , so that it came unrolled and you could read it . But with all its elegance , about the only thing listed on it was T-Bone steak , so that 's what they all had .  | Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men came by the table . Orlean was n't used to people who drank , so it came as a small shock to her that the people she was with were just happy and laughingly full of fun and life because of drinking , while for the same reason of drinking these strange men were hostile and arrogant as they stopped and stared openly at the women at the table . In a slurred voice , the biggest man said harshly , " You lucky boys sure got yourselves a purty bunch a ' fillies ! " Sherril grinned at him easily , though he was prepared for anything . " An ' you sure got terrific taste ! How ' bout a drink ? " The big man said , " I 'll just plop m'self down an ' take that drink with this here lady ! " His friends laughing , he started to sit beside Orlean on the arm of her chair . " I would n't do that , " Clair said , standing up . When he was standing near the big man it was obvious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same height , and within his slenderness there was the feeling of tensed , steel cables . " You gon na stop me ? ! " Very quietly , Clair said , " That 's right . " " Listen , buster ! Ya wan na step outside ? ! " " No , " Clair said levelly . " But if you push it , I sure will . " They stared at each other for a long moment . The big man finally shrugged and dropped his eyes . " Ah , the hell with it ! " He and the other men left the table , and Clair sat back down . Orlean put her hand on his and said in a small voice , " ? I was scared . " Clair grinned at her . " ? Me too . " But she did n't believe him .  | " I tell you , " Vivianne said , " I gave the air to parlor snakes like them a long time ago . Just one good bozo , like us three lucky girls got , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the ocean . " Then she smiled and said , " Say , it 's about time t ' open the champagne ! " Sherril opened the bottle with a loud popping sound , and began to pour . Clair looked at Orlean , and she nodded with a faint smile , so he held her glass out for Sherril to fill it along with the others . " Happy birthday again , " Evelyn said as they raised their glasses , and Sherril added laughingly , " Here 's if no pain , with champagne ! " As Orlean sipped and then put her glass down , Clair said , " Do ya like it ? " " ? Yes . " And then she nodded . " Yes , I do . " Clair and Miles lighted cigarettes , and Miles leaned over to light one for Vivianne . Orlean watched Sherril , his hands not too steady , as he began rolling his own cigarette , and Clair grinned and said , " Sherril 's really takin ' to the fancy life t'night . " " Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be fancier than homemade ones . " " Not this kind , " Sherril said . " It 's a real potent tobacco clear from Mexico that I smoke on special occasions . " He added with grinning pride , " It even got me the first half of a nickname a ' mine . " " What 's that ? " Orlean asked . Sherril ran his tongue over the cigarette paper . " Marijuana Huff aker . " Clair said , " It 's hard if tell which hits him hardest , that stuff ' r booze . " Sherril lighted it and took a long drag . " ? Do n't never do nothin ' if me. "  | " Not much . After a couple a ' them smokes , he always starts t ' get cross-eyed . " Sherril took another deep puff . " Not me . ? But sometimes the rest a ' the world starts t ' get a little cross-eyed . " " Either way you handsome brute , maybe we 'd better get in a couple of dances while we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 're two of me ! " " You 're on ! " Sherril stood up . " God knows just one redhead like you is enough t ' handle . " They left as the other two men stood up , and Miles said , " Well , how ' bout you an ' me doin ' the same , Ev ? " She smiled up at him . " I was beginning to think you 'd never ask . " As they also left now , Orlean looked up at Clair , but at the moment he seemed to be looking vaguely somewhere else , and he sat back down beside her . He made an unconsciously rather elaborate ceremony of lighting another cigarette , and then finally said , " I , ? I sure am glad you like that champagne . " " I am too . ? I 'd have had some anyway , to celebrate with Vivianne . ? But it really is good . " " Would , ? you like some more ? " " Yes , a little , thank you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount of the whiskey from his flask into the glass of mix before him . Orlean 's eyes went past him to the couples quickly gyrating on the dance floor to the loud music . " Sherril and Vivianne , and Miles and Evelyn , sure seem to be having a nice time out there , dancing . " " Yeah , they sure do . " Clair glanced at the dancers and then back at the glass before him . " I  --  was never too much for them fast , modern steps . "  | Orlean studied him a thoughtful moment and then said , " I agree with you , Clair . " " You do ? " " Um-hmm . Take that Charleston they 're doing now . It 's a lot better sort of dance for a girl , than for a man . " " Yeah , " Clair nodded , relaxing , " I always did favor the good old steps . " Then , as though the orchestra was reading Clair 's mind , the fast music suddenly stopped , and they started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Clair . " ? Like a waltz ? " Orlean said . Clair gripped his glass as though its very weight would make it impossible for him to stand up . " Well , ? t ' tell the truth , I ai n't even waltzed , ? in quite awhile . " " Why do n't we try ? " she asked hopefully . " I can remind you how it goes , and it 's real easy . " " Well , ? " Clair hesitated . " Besides , they 're playing a song we both like , " she encouraged . Still not recognizing or hardly even hearing the music , Clair managed to say , " ? Okay . " IIc stood up and held Orlean 's hand in his own suddenly damp palm to take her to the dance floor . The first few moments were sheer , sweating agony for Clair as he realized for the first time how hard it was to fake a waltz . Trying to grin slightly , he mumbled , " I 'm the only fella I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But I can tell that it 's all starting to come back to you , " Orlean said , gently leading him . " Just remember the rhythm . One , two , three . One , two , three . " After a short while Clair said , " I think I 'm gettin ' the hang of it . ? Again . " A little later Clair became so confident that he now began  | to lead Orlean , who was as light as a leaf in his arms , and seemed to know every move he was going to make before he knew himself . Soon Clair felt as though the dance floor had changed from an overheated torture chamber to a great , happy and carefree place to be . And relaxing , he started really hearing for the first time the music they were playing . " Hey ! " he said . " That song 's I ' 11 Take You Home Again , Kathleen ! ' The same thing you hummed an ' played on the guitar ! " She nodded , smiling up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for this dance , ? because I really love that song , and the name Kathleen . " " If ya think about it , " he said , smiling back at her in his new-found confidence , " it could just about be named after you . " " It could ? " " Sure . Orlean and Kathleen sound a whole lot alike , t ' me . " As the music now reached the right point , he spoke in a halfsinging voice along with it , " I 'll take you home again , ( ) clean . " Laughing , she said , " Well , I sure hope sooner or later , that 'll be true of tonight , at least . " " If I got a choice , " he grinned , " I 'll hold out for later . " The music stopped and the band then struck up a blasting rendition of " Do n't Bring Lulu . " Suddenly hesitant again , Clair said loudly enough to make himself heard , " That 's pretty rambunctious . " Understanding , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their table . " Whew ! " she at last said , sitting down , " I was ready for another sip of my champagne , anyway ! " " If you 're not used t ' that stuff , " Clair told her in a gentle voice , " it can kinda sneak up on ya . "  | " Should n't I have any more ? " " Well , I guess if you just finish that second glass it wo n't hurt . " " All right . " She frowned in quiet thought . " ? But I really do like it . " Miles and Evelyn came back to the table , and later Sherril and Vivianne returned , both of them flushed and gaily excited from their dancing . Over newly-made drinks they all joked and laughed together happily for a long while , and then Evelyn finally said , " Clair , you and Orlean looked just wonderful out there on the dance floor . I did n't know you danced . " " He 's a very good dancer , " Orlean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shook his head slowly . " Sherril , you an ' Viv can keep on goin ' forever . You ought t ' join the marathon dance t'night , an ' easy win yourselves that goddamned five-hundred-dollar prize money ! " " No  --  sirree ! " Vivianne gave Sherril a hug with one arm , raising a glass in her free hand . " Real dancin 's got t ' be only for the love of it , an ' not ever for any prize . " " Unless the prize is a redhead , " Sherril said , " in which case I 'd , ? dance on m ' hands on the ceilin ' . " " Well , hell , " Miles shrugged . " I just think ya could win it , is all . " Orlean finished the last few drops of champagne in her glass . And then , hardly realizing it , she said , " I know what Vivianne means . " Everyone looked at her , waiting for her to go on , and she was suddenly at a hopeless loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instantly thundering into a roof-shaking roar of jazz that made conversation nearly impossible through the entire Salt Palace Pavillion . Laughing and inexhaustible , Sherril and Vivianne quickly headed for the dance floor , and soon after Miles and Evelyn  | followed them . Clair called a waiter over , and Orlean realized that he was trying to pay the bill . But she gathered from his shrugging frown that it had already somehow been taken care of by Sherril . After the last , crashing sound of music , a new , smaller orchestra started to replace the first one . It was after midnight , and the marathon was now about to begin . Orlean saw that the new dancers were being given large numbers on pieces of cardboard to wear around their necks . And what a difference there was between them and the happy , other couples who were now coming off the floor . Most of the newcomers were shabbily dressed , but more than that their faces and even their spirits seemed somehow to be shabby and wan , each pair of eyes filled with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that this was the time to go , and when she looked at Clair she saw that he understood it too . On the drive back to Sherril 's all three of the men , and Vivianne too , had a few drinks from the flasks . Finally after late goodbyes , while the others were having a nightcap at Sherril 's and Vivianne 's house , Clair drove her back home in the Model A sedan . But when he parked quietly in front of Melva 's house , despite the unheard of hour , she did n't feel like getting out of the car . Clair sensed her feeling , and shared it , and not knowing quite what else to do he lighted a cigarette . " ? I hope ya  --  had a good time . " " Oh , I did ! " " I 'm sorry , ? about that fella tryin ' t ' sit beside ya . " She smiled in the darkness of the front seat that was lighted only dimly by the tiny , glowing tip of his cigarette . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so afraid , about dancing . "  | " I 've run inta ' bullies before , " he said . " But t ' be really honest , Orlean , I never did get out an ' dance , b'fore . " " I know that . " She could feel his sudden , probing look in the dark , and she said , " But you really are good at it . All you have to do , is to not be afraid of dancing . " He was silent for so long that Orlean thought he might not speak again . But then he said , " You told us you knew what Vivianne meant , about not dancin ' for a prize . ? What was it you were thinkin ' ? " Choosing her words as carefully as she could , she said , " ? In a way , dancing is kind of , ? like life itself . " She paused , trying to explain exactly how she felt . " With either one , you have to do it because you just plain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not because of some kind of a prize that somebody might maybe hand you say , at the end of the road . " Clair thought about this and then took a long breath that was like a sigh . " ? I guess I better take you in . " " I guess so . " They walked to the front door where a lamp had been left just barely burning inside of it to give a tiny light . At the door , Orlean turned and asked quietly , " Was tonight , the first time , that you ever danced with a girl ? ? Really ? " " Well . " Clair was glad it was dark , so she could n't see the plain truth on his face . " ? Pretty darn close to it . " But she knew the truth , even in the dark . " I 'm glad . ? And I was probably more scared tonight than you were . " " You ? Scared ? " " Melva and Margaret have tried to teach me a little bit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with , too . " " Well , I 'll be damned , " he said very quietly . " You sure had me fooled on that score . "  | " ? Will I see you then , again ? " Her large eyes were softly luminous and sweetly wistful as she looked at him in the dim moonlight cast from above . " If I got anything at all t ' say about it , you sure will . " He paused , and then a few good and right-sounding words came to him . " ? I do n't know why , Orlean . But every time I see you , it 's like the first time that I ever did see you , and it 's somehow like something happening , ? all over again . " She smiled , then reached up to kiss him quickly on the cheek . And in the next moment she was gone , swiftly disappearing through the front door and into the house . After a long , quiet moment , Clair turned and walked slowly back to the Model @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drive away on the dark , dusty street .  | THERE WAS a brief , briskly-cool Indian summer that year , and on three or four Sundays Clair took Orlean out past the tiny settlement of Bacchus and far up on the no longer used , rough and pitted old wagon trail into Starley 's Canyon . Melva disapproved of these Sunday trips for two reasons . One , Orlean was missing church more and more , and even worse did n't seem to mind it at all . And two , they went on Clair 's motorcycle , which Melva still could n't help but consider a minor work of the devil . But both of her disapprovals were held back , shown only with a slightly raised eyebrow , or voiced only by an occasional , faint sigh . Because , still and always , the far most important thing was Orlean 's happiness . And Melva had never in her life seen her little sister so happy as she was now . Even her confidence had grown , and while she was still shy , it was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Orlean 's point of view , that first ride behind Clair had taken more courage and blind faith than she 'd ever known she had . But he 'd driven slowly and carefully , feeling her frightened arms holding tightly around him , until gradually she 'd become more relaxed and secure . It was n't too long , as a matter of fact , before Orlean started urging him to higher speeds and tricky turns , but he would never try anything with the slightest risk to it while she was aboard . On the last of their trips to Starley 's Canyon , the brisk  | Indian summer was already giving way to the cold threat of a bitter , hard winter coming down from the high , northern mountains . Orlean was wearing an old pair of Levis that Wayne had outgrown and given to her for her cycle riding . She had on a warm jacket , and the rakish , leather cap that Clair had gotten into the habit of loaning her for the rides . On the two-mile , deserted straightaway between Magna and Bacchus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she held onto him , Orlean 's long , dark-brown hair trailed out gracefully behind her from underneath the leather cap . And finally , as they mounted farther up into Starley 's Canyon , it became , as always , like entering a whole new world . Gone were the flat , dull grays and blacks that made up Magna and the barren mining-mountain beside it . Here there was a happy , breezy battle of endless color between the thickly growing trees dressed in their shimmering , deep-autumn leaves . There were even large clumps of hardy , green grass , and here and there vivid , eye-stunning patches of yellow , red and blue wild flowers . And the air ! Since the very first time Clair had brought her up here , Orlean had compared each breath she took with the light , invigorating taste of the champagne she 'd tried at the Salt Palace Pavillion . There was a clean , cool , refreshing similarity , but it was this air , finally , that tasted better . They stopped at a high meadow with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of many birds singing from within the trees . Orlean got out some sandwiches and hard-boiled eggs she 'd brought along in the saddlebag of the motorcycle , and they sat next to each other by the small stream to eat . " ? Do you know ? " she said . " We 're only a few mountains away from Magna , and the mine . " " Yeah ? "  | " An eagle could fly from here to there , ? in ten minutes . " " Never talked to an eagle about it , but I guess that 's about the time it 'd take . " Then he added , " ? It sure is different here , all right . " " I just wish we could , ? just stay right here , forever . " " Be kinda hard , with winter comin ' on , " he grinned . " Unless we took up trappin ' for a livin ' . " " I 'd be willing . " " A big , hungry bear 'd git ya , for sure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said abruptly , " Do you still , ? know , ? many of the other girls , from all the other places you 've been before ? " " You sure can change a subject fast . " He hesitated . " No . I only ever really knew a couple , anyway . An ' not for long . " He paused again . " I guess , ? you 're the only one I ever sorta just , started goin ' around with , ? in a kinda , regular way . " " Do you know why ? " " No . " He thought a moment . " It 's just a somehow natural thing . " She moved closer to him . " That 's nice . " Clair put his arm around her . " It sure seems like it t ' me . " After its few , beginning threats against the brief Indian summer , winter suddenly roared in with swift , white fury , its howling winds bringing one freezing blizzard after another . With ashes from stoves , and salt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cloaking whiteness , the dark , poisonous smoke from the mill and the smelter helping to turn the snow there into brackish and shrunken , heavy black sludge . No car was without snow chains on its tires , and even with them they often became hopelessly stuck in the deep snow or icy sludge , or a combination of both . In these hard winter times travel was limited , and for a  | young couple to simply and vaguely go outside of an evening was impossible . So under these conditions , Clair finally agreed to having supper now and then with Orlean , at Melva and Al 's . But Clair would never come without bringing a gift . The first time it was a bottle of Big Bertha Pearl 's best wine , which in a Mormon home was a mistake . It was accepted with mumbled appreciation by Melva , who then quietly put it out of sight in a cupboard . In his own loud , good-natured way , Al helped by clapping Clair on the shoulder and saying , " We 'll keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , Clair brought other things , usually a box of chocolates . And even though they were " family " evenings he enjoyed them , especially when Margaret and Darrell , happy and carefree in their bubbling young , and obvious love for each other , were there too . And sometimes , best of all , they would go into the parlor after supper , where Orlean would strum the guitar and sing for them , a thing she had n't done for a long time . The high point of that first part of winter was when Sherril and Vivianne decided to go on an overnight trip to Wendover , and asked Clair and Orlean to go with them . That was a great hardship for Melva , because Orlean had never in her life spent a night without being with someone in her family . When finally it was made clear to Melva that Vivianne would personally look out for Orlean , and that the late November roads to Nevada were n't too bad , she at last , although still reluctantly , agreed . Wendover was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nevada . Half of it was in one state , and half in the other . And when they got there , Clair explained to Orlean how to gamble . With his explanations in mind , Orlean gambled his quarters on blackjack , and then at roulette , and at about midnight she was seven dollars ahead . In the meantime he 'd only lost two dollars , so they came out five dollars  | ahead , which was enough for them to take Sherril and Vivianne to a good dinner . There was an all-night photograph place there , and Clair thought the two of them ought to have their picture taken . So they did , and that picture was the one souvenir that Orlean brought with her when she got home late the next day . A very relieved Melva and she were alone in the kitchen , having a secret cup of coffee together , when she took out the photo envelope and handed it to her big sisfer . " A picture ? " Orlean nodded soberly . " ? Taken last night . " Melva @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh , my God ! " What she was looking at was a very clear photograph of both Clair and Orlean locked up in a jail cell together . Both of them were holding bottles in their hands and had obviously just been arrested . Clair was frowning angrily , while Orlean looked unutterably innocent despite the bottle in her hands , casting her anguished eyes upwards , as though asking personal guidance from the Dear Lord to help her get out of this awful predicament . " What happened ? ! " Melva cried . But Orlean was already laughing , so that Melva knew it was n't as bad as it seemed to be . " It 's just a joke ! They can take your picture so that it looks like anything ! We could have been fat people in funny swimming suits on the beach , or standing in front of the Eiffel Tower ! ? Or we could have even been pirates , or about to be hanged as horse thieves , if we wanted to ! " Melva took a long , relieved breath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them imprisoned . " ? Well ! " She took a sip of coffee and coughed a little so that she would have a moment to catch up with her little sister . " ? Which pictures ,  | in all of them different , crazy things , did you most want t ' be in ? " " Just any one of them . Or maybe even all of them , " Orlean said . And then she shrugged thoughtfully . " You know , Melva , none of them could ever be anything but right , ? just as long as Clair was there beside me . " Christmas seemed to come that year as suddenly as winter itself . On Christmas Eve , Clair nosed his motorcycle slowly through the snow and eased it up to park it near the dimly lighted kitchen door . Orlean opened the door and let him in , flushed with happiness and excitement . She was there alone . Margaret had gone with Darrell to an early church meeting , and Melva and Al were stopping off before church to visit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want coffee ? " she asked . " Well , " he nodded , " that sounds ? " " First come and see our Christmas tree ! " Taking his hand , she led him quickly through the kitchen to the parlor , where a few candles on a tiny tree in a corner shed dim light through the room . There were strands of popcorn draped around it and its candles , and some colorful pieces of cut-out paper in the shapes of pointed stars and quarter and half-moons and jagged-edged suns tried , with surprising success , to make a small universe of that even smaller tree . " That really is pretty , " Clair said . " See this ? " Orlean touched the largest , silvery-metallic star that gleamed brightly at the top of the small tree , gaily reflecting the lights of the burning candles below . " Yeah . ? It really is nice . "  | " I made it . " She grinned mischievously . " And everybody in the church ward thinks it 's the prettiest star around . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mischief on her face . " Why should n't they ? " Her grin turned into a small , happy giggle . " I made it from the best thing I could find , Clair . It 's the bottom of an old coffee can ! " He smiled , shaking his head , and then started laughing along with her . " I 'm surprised ya did n't politely offer them all a drink of that wine hidden in the kitchen . " " Oh , darn ! " She snapped her fingers . " I knew I 'd go and forget something ! " " You sure are in a good mood . " He hugged her warmly . " But first of all , little girl , you , Merry Christmas . " They kissed for a long moment , and then she stood back , smiling . " I think I finally got your present right ! " " Got it right ? " " Just in the nick of time ! Let 's go back into the kitchen ! " She quickly put out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , adding with a shake of her head , " It seems like I 'm always just barely finishing things in the nick of time ! " Sitting at the kitchen table , Clair frowned and repeated to himself , " ? You finally got it right ? ? I know ! You 've knitted me a purple pair of socks . " Making their coffee at the stove she said , " No . " " Then , ? a purple pair of mittens ? " " All those things are wrong . I ca n't knit . " " You ca n't ? " He frowned again . " ? You did n't , by any chance , make me a bracelet out of the tin left over from that old can ? " " You 'll never guess ! " " Well , at least , I know ya got it right . "  | Orlean could hardly wait to empty her cup , and then she said eagerly , " I know it 's still not Christmas , but can I give it to you now ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clair started to get up , but Orlean said , " No , not at the tree ! You have to see it in here , where there 's good light ! " She hurried into the parlor and returned with her hands behind her back . Then , at the last moment she stopped a step away from Clair , suddenly uncertain and hesitant . " ? I , ? maybe , it is n't right , ? after all . " Clair reached out and touched her arm gently . " ? Hey , you , " he said with soft patience . " ? Can I please have my Christmas present ? " She nodded slightly , then slowly brought her arms around from behind her holding a beautifully wrapped package about the size and shape of an oversized but very thin book . Smiling , he said , " It 's got t ' be a book a ' dancin ' instructions . " Orlean shook her head very slightly and handed it to him . Now holding it , Clair said thoughtfully and seriously , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Clair opened it and looked at it . For a long moment he did n't speak . And then finally , in a very low voice , he said , " ? My God . " It was a large , magnificent pen-and-ink drawing of a proud rider on a splendid , rearing stallion . It was so lifelike that he could almost hear the great stallion snorting defiance , could almost feel its mighty hoofs thundering against the earth . And though it took him a moment more to realize it , Clair at last saw that it was he himself who was that proud rider . As though it were someone else speaking , Clair heard his own voice say , " ? You , ? did this ? " Orlean nodded a little , standing beside him , and then at last said , " ? Do you like it ? "  | Still holding the drawing in one hand to look at it , he put his other arm around her , his tight hug wordlessly telling her the answer . After a long silence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within its wrapping paper . Then , with his other arm still around Orlean , he pulled her gently down onto his lap . In a low voice , and with the shadow of a grin , he said , " Well , little girl , you sure have gone an ' wrecked me . " " I have ? " " Yep . After that present a ' yours , ? there ai n't nothin ' I can ever give ya back . " " Well , ? you could try . " " Okay . " He sighed and took a small package wrapped in yellow paper and tied with a yellow ribbon from his pocket . " This is the very best item that ' Woolworth 's had t ' offer . " Quickly Orlean unwrapped a small box and then opened the box . " ? Oh ! " she murmured , taking out a finely-made , delicate gold necklace with a gold , heart-shaped locket on it , and holding it to the light . " Oh , Clair ! " she went on breathlessly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " This must have cost you a fortune ! " " The heart part opens , " he said . She hesitated before opening it . " ? Is it a picture of you ? " " Funny , " he smiled . " That 's the same question I asked you before . ? In both cases the answer 's , no . " She opened the locket . Inscribed on one side of the heart was the name " Orlean . " And on the other was " Clair . " Slowly , unable to speak , she closed the locket . Then , when she finally thought she might be able to at least whisper without her voice betraying her , she turned in Clair 's lap , handed him the necklace , and asked , " ? Would you , ? put it on me ? "  | Later , with the Christmas tree candles burning low , they sat in each other 's arms on the sofa , watching the flickering candle-flames dimly lighting the shadowy parlor . At last Orlean shifted slightly in Clair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What are you thinking ? " " Oh , ? " He leaned down and kissed her on the forehead . " Lots a ' things . Like , maybe , goin ' t ' some kinda school , so I could get a really good job . " She laid her head close against his chest . " You could do anything you ever wanted to . " " Hmmm ! " He grinned in the shadows . " You should talk , ? drawin ' the way you do . " " You did n't mind ? ? Being on a horse , instead of a motor-cycle ? " " Had n't thought about it . ? But I like it best , just the way you did it . " She kissed his shirt softly . " ? I 'm glad . " After a long moment , he said quietly , " Orlean ? " " Hmmm ? " Then , after another long silence , he said very carefully , " I guess I 'm going to have to be the first one to say this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Her small body against his became absolutely still , as though everything within her had suddenly stopped in the middle of a breath , and only the warmth of her remained . Then , after an eternity of stillness , Clair faintly felt her begin to breathe again . In a small child 's simple , questioning way , she said , " ? Why , Clair ? " " I do n't know . ? I just do . " She looked up at him in the shadows , soft tears glistening dimly in her eyes . " ? I 've loved you , ever since the very first time that I ever saw you . " He raised her in his arms slightly , so that he could kiss the  | tears in her eyes . And then , as he hugged her gently back and forth in his embracing arms , he said quietly , " I guess , maybe , I felt that same way you did , at that same time . " " No , " she said gently , blinking and smiling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kissed away . " It took you longer , Clair . " He shrugged . " ? Might be , a little bit . " " And  --  I was afraid , you 'd never feel , the way I do . " " ? Afraid ? " " ? I would n't know what to do , anymore , without you , Clair . " " Then , ? do n't be afraid , " he said , holding her close . " Tell me a thing , " she said . " ? How do you start to depend on a man even more than your life itself , ? and yet not want to make him feel unhappy , or responsible for all that ? " " Easy , " he said , holding her closer and warmer . " The man makes himself responsible , if he 's any man at all . " After a minute , Orlean said , " Those candles are burning pretty low on the tree . " " I 'll get them . " Clair left the sofa and crossed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he returned to sit beside her , the room was now totally dark , except for a tiny patch of yellow coming from beneath the closed door to the kitchen . Curling up in his arms again , she said , " ? Can I be your girl , then ? " " I 'll take it under consideration . " He drew her closer to him . " ? Even if you ca n't knit . "  | CLAIR AND Orlean spent all the time they could together during the holidays , and they even stayed up all night on New Year 's at a small party at Sherril and Vivianne 's , so that it was daylight before Clair finally got her back to Melva 's kitchen door . " Good night , " he said . " Or good mornin ' , dependin ' on how ya look at it . " " I like both . " " Yeah . They do both have a natural ring to ' em , ? said b'tween us . " " I 'll see you here for supper ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm practically livin ' here , these days . " " Melva and Al do n't mind . " She smiled , " And I sure do n't . ? Besides , they 're going out tonight after supper , anyway . " " That 's nice of ' em . " She stood on tiptoe and kissed him . " ? If you behave , you can help me with the dishes . " He kissed her back . " And if I do n't behave ? " " In that case , " she smiled , " we 'll probably forget all about the dishes . " Then , still smiling , she turned and hurried into the house . And through the coming weeks , it was the same . Whatever time Clair had off from his two jobs was spent with Orlean . They went to a few movies at the Gem Theater , and one  | night , he even took her to what he called " a smoker , " along with Sherril and Vivianne . " What 's a smoker ? " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smokes . " " ? Oh . " He laughed . " Maybe you 'll like it and maybe you wo n't , but it 's something that everybody ought to at least try once . " " All right , ? if you say so , Clair . " Both Clair and Sherril were prepared for the night with flasks and some cigars . They drove to a big building on the outskirts of Salt Lake . Inside , it was crowded and deafeningly noisy , with the smoke of a thousand cigars making the air an almost solid blue haze . There were long , packed rows of benches set up around a raised , brightly lighted and two bloody prize fights before , finally and mercifully , it was time to go . On the drive back to Magna , Clair said , " Did you really hate it as much as it looked like you did ? " " Ohhh ! " She shuddered slightly . " More . " " Well , " Clair shrugged . " I guess it 's all a part of learning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , " Tell ya what . You were a good sport t'night . So the next thing we do will be anything you want to . " " ? Anything ? " " Absolutely . " " Good . " She grinned faintly in the dark back seat of the car . " ? We 'll go to church . " After a long , quiet moment , he said , " ? Church ? " " Church . " And then she added , " ? It 's all a part of learning about life . " They 'd gone to church and Clair had suffered silently through the seemingly endless meeting .  | Afterwards , walking back to Melva 's , Orlean clung to Clair 's arm on an icy stretch of road , and smiled up at him . " Did you hate it as much as it looked like you did ? " " I just loved it . " He grinned down at her . " And believe it or not , I even saw the light . ? I ai n't never again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On a darkly overcast Thursday evening , with the heavy threat of a coming , hard snowfall in the air , Clair finished his last delivery of groceries and returned the bicycle to the alley behind Swenson 's . Then he gunned his Indian to life and drove through the growing dark to Melva 's place . Orlean heard the motorcycle 's engine and opened the kitchen door , calling out before Clair got to it . " Come on in ! Boy , it 's going to be a cold night ! " " Anybody else home ? " " No . " She helped him off with his chilly-feeling leather jacket . " Not for an hour or so . " As almost always now , when they were alone , they had coffee together at the kitchen table . There was a soft , warm silence as they sipped their coffee , and then Clair said rather suddenly , " For a long time now , I been meanin ' to ask you somethin ' . " Orlean looked up with slightly startled eyes . " What ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' scare ya . " Then he said , " But how come you never buy any coffee , and yet always have it on hand ? " She smiled at the question , almost with relief . " I guess it 's okay to let the cat out of the bag . Melva and Margaret drink it , too . So , every now and then , when anyone 's in Salt Lake , they pick up one or two cans . " " Well , I 'll be darned , " Clair grinned . " This innocent- lookin ' place is just one step away from bein ' a Chinese opium den . " Orlean smiled at him slightly , her eyes faintly troubled . " Hey , " he said , frowning a little . " ? I promise never t ' tell , ? no matter how much they torture me . " Her smile widened , but her eyes were still not smiling with her lips . Suddenly very serious , Clair said , " ? What is it , Orlean ? " He waited a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somethin ' on your mind . I been feelin ' it for a little while , now . " But still she did n't answer . She looked at him with warm , loving eyes , and then her eyes lowered to quietly study the top of the table between them . Still frowning slightly , Clair took another sip of coffee . " Do n't ya think ya could , tell me ? ? Hell , honey , the way it ' ' s gotten t ' be , I 'm practically a member of the family . " At these words , she looked back up at him , trying vainly to muster a faint smile . " That , ? sort of , touches on it , Clair . " " What does ? " She tried again , without much success , to smile at him . " The family part . ? I 'm going to have a baby . " There was a sudden , deafening silence in the kitchen , and for a long moment the only thing Clair was really aware of was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left temple . Finally , as though with someone else 's very quiet voice , he said , " If I heard you right . And I think I did . What you meant if say is , ? we 're going to have a baby . ' " For the first time now , listening to the quiet words that Clair was saying to her , faint tears began to dampen Orlean 's eyes . " ? We are ? " Clair nodded and reached his hand across the table to place it gently down on the top of hers . " ? But from what little bit I know , ? you 'll wind up doin ' the lion 's share . "  | She turned her hand under his and clasped it , their palms touching together with a sudden , tight , almost fierce warmth , and their eyes meeting with silent , level love across the table . Finally , Clair said , " That 's been a heavy burden f'r you t ' carry all alone . Why did n't ya tell me ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her eyes with her free hand . " At first I did n't know , for sure . And then , ? I do n't know . " " You are sure though , now ? " She nodded . " I guess I 've been afraid of , ? well , do n't you feel mad , Clair , or scared , or kind of , ? trapped ? " He squeezed her hand and managed a small grin to help offset his answer . " I sure do . " " ? Which one ? " " All three . " He put his other hand out to now clasp her small hand between both of his . " But mostly I feel like , say sometime next week , gettin ' married . ? If ya will . " Orlean just barely managed to hold back a small sob . " That 's a terrible reason for you to have to ask me to marry you ! " Clair stood and pulled her up into his warmly embracing arms . " Hell , honey , it 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ born outta pure , simple love , an ' that 's sure the best way . " He kissed both of her cheeks gently , and then grinned lovingly down at her . " B'sides , any old excuse t ' do it is as good as another , if ya really feel like spendin ' the rest of your life with one special person , in the first place . " " But you were thinking of going to school , of learning , of ? " " Hey , " he interrupted quietly . " It seems t ' me I just asked you t ' marry me , and somehow got cut off there with no answer . " She hugged him hard , her head against his chest . " Oh , yes ! But you know that ! "  | Gently , he raised her face up toward his , and they kissed for a long , soft moment . Then he sighed a long , slow sigh , and smiled . " ? I never did get engaged t ' be married , b'fore . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ? feel like celebratin ' , just now . " " Me too . " Suddenly she smiled beamingly up at him . " And we can , right here ! " Orlean hurried to the cupboard and reached high up to get the unopened bottle of wine that Clair had brought to the house long before . " Well , I 'll be , ? " Clair said . " I 'm marryin ' a very good provider . " They opened the bottle and Clair poured two glasses of wine at the table . And then they lifted their glasses , looking at each other without yet drinking . " What can ya drink to , at a time like this ? " Clair said in a low voice . " ? I do n't know . " Moving his glass gently from side to side in his fingers , slightly shifting the suddenly precious and meaningful wine within it , Clair said , " I do n't , either . ? Do ya drink t ' life , or happiness , or a good marriage ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long haul up there , in front of us . ? The way the world goes , hard an ' cruel sometimes darlin ' , I 'd guess there 'll be some times when both of us would be willin ' t ' drink t ' just not hurtin ' so much , anymore . " He paused for a moment , and then his infectious grin started to show itself on his face . " But t ' hell with whatever them tough times there are ahead , that 'll just naturally be comin ' our way . " His grin broadened . " You an ' me just bein ' there t'gether will , ? will make everything a thousand times worth anything . " Clair took a long breath . " That 's my wish , for this celebratin ' wine . " And then he said , " Before we drink , ? have you got one ? "  | Orlean hesitated , thinking deeply of what Clair had said . And then , finally , she spoke quietly . " Yes . I do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought of it , when you brought me back here on New Year 's , and it was already daylight . " She stopped and smiled shyly at Clair . " ? Some words came to my mind then , that I ca n't explain , but that I ca n't get out of my mind . ? When we walked to the door , and when you kissed me. ? " " ? Yes ? " " Those words , and the way I felt just then , keep coming back to me . ? And right now , I 'd like to drink both to what you just said , ? and to those words that I ca n't forget . " They both raised their glasses , and Orlean said very quietly , " ? One time , ? I saw morning come home . " Later , Melva suddenly came from out of the bitter night and into the warm kitchen with a great gust of cold , blizzard wind , quickly forcing the door shut behind her . Shaking snow from her coat , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Orlean at the table with the open bottle of wine and two glasses before them . Orlean moved to help her , as Clair stood up . Orlean took the package as Melva shrugged out of her coat . " Wine has never been on that table before , " she said . " Did both of you get snake-bit at the same time ? " " Melva , " Clair said . " I asked Orlean to marry me , and she said she would . " " Well . " Melva hung her coat on a coat-hanger in the corner and said a little brusquely , " I think it 's about time . " Then , her back to them , she went to the window , seemingly looking out into the dark for something that was n't there . " ? Are you glad , Melva ? " Orlean finally asked .  | Still turned to the window , Melva said , " ? If there 's another glass , I 'll have a small drink of that wine with the two of you , before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came into the light a moment later , to join them at the table , that Clair and Orlean saw the tears on her cheeks . Before starting to work at The Smokehouse that night , Clair went to see Big Bertha Pearl in her office . She could see that he had something crucially important on his mind , and she frowned up at him from behind her desk , shifting the massive strings of pearls around her neck . " You look like ya been hit over the head with a twelve-pound sledgehammer . " " I 'm , ? gettin ' married . " She hesitated just long enough to blink once , before answering . " Man usually gets about that same look you got , either way . You better sit down , ' r you 'll never last long enough t ' make it . " He sat on an overstuffed chair as she came around the desk to sit facing him thoughtfully on a nearby sofa . " I guess , ? the whole idea 's just startin ' t ' sink in , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " You sure ya want to , Clair ? Because , ? if certain things 're forcin ' a marriage that ai n't wanted , there 's ways if get around it . " Clair felt his forehead become warmer . " ? There 's nothin ' I ever wanted so much in my life . " Big Bertha was silent for a moment , and then said , " She the one who drew that picture a ' you , ya got hangin ' up in your room ? " Clair nodded . " Did n't know ya 'd seen it . " " Well , I did . An ' just judgin ' from that alone , I can double guarantee she sure does think the world a ' you . " Big Bertha  | hesitated . " ? Maybe , almost , even more'n she ought to , Clair . " He looked at her , his eyes faintly surprised and questioning . " lIell , " Big Bertha smiled , " that little girl drew you like a perfect goddamned conquerin ' hero , ? a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Holy Grails . " She paused again . " That 's a hard measurement t ' live up to . " " The best I can do , ? is my best . " For the first and only time , Big Bertha leaned forward and patted Clair 's hand twice with her own , heavily bejeweled fingers . " I guess that 's just about exactly what you will do . " Then she leaned back and was suddenly her normal , businessike self again . " You came t ' see me for two reasons . The cond part is t ' tell me you 're quittin ' . " " ? I 'm sorry about leavin ' . But I do have if get a real job , ow . " " Sure ya do . " With such a tiny hint of sadness in her voice that Clair did n't hear it , she went on , " No more time f'r you t ' just kick around like a kid anymore , an ' sorta gradually figure out just what the hell direction y'r goin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on her neck . " Right now it 's gettin ' a job , an ' full speed ahead . What ya got in mind ? " Clair said , " They ai n't hirin ' much these days , but I guess I'Il try up at the mine t'morrow . " For a moment , Big Bertha looked down silently at the flowered carpet on the floor . " Well , looks like every man ever born around here winds up goin ' t ' work at that mine , sooner r ' later . ? Ya sure that 's what you want , Clair ? " " What else is there ? " " Yeah , " she sighed . " I guess it is just about the only game in town . " She went back to her desk and quickly wrote a short note on a piece of paper , then put it in an envelope and sealed it .  | " When ya go up there t'morrow ask if see Ray Gorman , an ' give him this . " " Ray Corman ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An ' do n't let nobody else open the envelope . " She handed it to him . " Need any money , Clair ? " " No . " " ? Did n't think ya would . An ' workin ' here or not , go ahead an ' use your room as long as ya need , or ya want . " He put the envelope back on her desk . " You 're probably the best lady I ever ran into . But the way I am , I ca n't take nothin ' from nobody . " He started from her office , then turned and said , " Thanks , anyway . " She came to him and held out the envelope once more . " You take this , an ' take care a ' yourself . " Still , he hesitated . " ? An ' mostly , Clair , you take good care a ' the girl who drew that picture . " At these last words , Clair finally nodded , and then took the envelope . " I 'll do m @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time off from Mr. Swenson and walked up the long , steep path to the mine , where he asked the man at the check-in point how to find the Administration Office . It was a gray , one-story building just above the two facing lines of fine houses that made up the B &; G Row , and slightly below the vast , metal work-buildings , smokegrimed and noisy , looming higher up on the side of the mountain . On a board hanging from a wall in the entrance of the Administration Building , Clair read down the list of names until he came to " Corman , R. ( Supt. ) Room 125 . " Finding  | the door numbered 125 , he hesitated before it briefly , and then knocked . From within a loud , impatient voice called , " Yeah ? ! It ai n't locked ! " Clair entered the room , taking off his leather cap and closing the door behind him . It was a small room with a plain wooden desk , a few filing cabinets along one wall . Seated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was a heavy , surly looking man wearing a white shirt with a tie loosened at his throat . " Well ? " " Mr. Corman ? " " Yeah ? What ya want ? ! " " I 'm lookin ' for a job . " " You 're wastin ' your time . We ai n't hirin ' . " Clair paused , almost ready to turn and leave . Then he stepped to the desk and put the sealed envelope on it . " I was told t ' give ya this . " Corman frowned , then ripped it open and read the short note , his frown deepening . After a silent moment , he very systematically and carefully tore both the note and the envelope into very tiny shreds and dropped them into his wastepaper basket . Finally looking back at Clair he said , " ? Maybe , if we tried , we could find somethin ' . " " I 'm willing if start at any job ya got up here in the mine . " " This here ai n't the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the mill . The mine 's thirty miles north , up t ' Bingham . An ' the smelter 's off over t'ward Garfield an ' Smelter Town . " " Well , yeah ? " " An ' they 're all joined t'gether by our own railroad , which I 'm super of . How d ' ya feel about railroads ? " " Good. ? Real good . " " You got any school ? " " Eighth , nearly ninth grade . I can read an ' write , an ' there  | ai n't many arithmetic problems I ca n't figure out pretty quick . " " Maybe , just maybe , we could use another electrician 's helper on them tracks . " He nodded to himself , still locked within his constant frown . " Guess we might could put ya on sometime next week . " " Well , Mr. Corman , that sure does sound good t ' me . " During the next hectic week everything seemed to happen , and have to be done , at once . Clair explained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It 's seven days a week , an ' long days . But it pays twenty-four dollars a week ! " " That 's almost a hundred dollars a month ! " " An ' I think I found us a house we can live in . " " A whole house ? ! " " Well , the house has only got one room , but it 's a nice room . It 's got a good stove in it . And even runnin ' water inside . " Slightly worried , she said , " How much is it ? " " Nineteen dollars a month . That might be a little high , but I think we can fix it up real nice . An ' I told ' em it was no deal until you 'd seen it . " She saw it , and liked it , and then there were a thousand more decisions to make and things to do . Clair did n't want a church wedding , but compromised at the idea of being married by a Mormon bishop named Hartkee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helped Orlean work on her wedding dress , mostly just changing and simplifying her white , earlier Salt Palace Pavillion dress . Her two sisters also tried to help Orlean get the small , one-room house cleaned and partly furnished and as ready as possible . The first time she and Melva went there , Margaret said , " House ? Melva , this ai n't a house . It 's a garage with the garage door sealed up . "  | " Do n't you never say that t ' nobody else , " Melva told her . " An ' give me a hand with this curtain for the window . " Sherril and Wayne worked with Clair over the weekend to get the rusted old potbellied stove in one corner of the room , with its smudged , wire-held tin chimney sticking up through t he ceiling , working again . And both Clair and Orlean bought a very few , needed things for the house . Finally , on the evening that they were to be married , Clair picked Orlean up at seven o'clock , wearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Vivianne were waiting for them in the car on the street as Orlean opened the front door , her eyes radiant . Wetting his lips slightly , Clair said , " ? You ready t ' go ? " She nodded wordlessly , and a few minutes later the four of them entered the parlor of Bishop Hartkee 's home . The bishop and his wife were a warm , down-to-earth couple in their fifties . Both of them hugged Orlean and I lartkee shook hands with Clair , nodding cordially toward Sherril and Vivianne . " Well , well , " he said , " I baptized this little girl , Orlean Bird , never dreamin ' I 'd also have the privilcge and honor of goin ' on an ' j oinin ' her in Holy Matrimony . " He smiled at Sherril . " Well , Sherril , we do n't seem t ' lee each other too much these days , but I reckon this very pretty lady beside you is your new bride , Vivianne , and sure as shootin ' this nervous young fella @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Sherril nodded . " That 's right , Bishop . " " He 's my best man , Bishop , " Clair said . " Well , you just make yourselves all comfortable and relax . I never lost nobody yet at a weddin ' ceremony . Here , let me take your coats . " " Would any of you , " Mrs. Hartkee asked , " care for a freshmade cranberry juice cocktail , in view of the occasion ? " It seemed the only right thing to do , so they all accepted . And a moment later , cranberry juice in hand , Clair got  | Orlean a little away from the others and said in a low voice , " Listen , I do n't want you t ' worry about it , but I 'm busted . " Her eyes widening in distress , she touched the gold-heart locket she was wearing around her throat and whispered , " I was afraid you spent too much on this . " " No , that was worth more than anything . But after buyin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plates , an ' some knives an ' forks , an ' that second-hand table an ' bed we had t ' get , it all sure adds up . " " Oh , I know ! " " I only got seven dollars left . Two ones , an ' a five . But with them givin ' us cranberry juice an ' all , I sure hope it 'll add up all right . " " Oh , Clair , " she said , grave concern in her eyes . " I 'd rather die than for you to be embarrassed . " " Guess all we can do is see what happens . " He managed a small grin . " Right now we 'll get married . An ' then if it turns out we could n't afford it in the first place , we 'll grab the marriage license and make a run for it . " Bishop Hartkee came over to them with two small paper forms to fill out . " This is nothin ' , " he said easily . " Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an ' like that . Why do n't ya sit at the table here ? You 'll find pens in the drawer . " Part way through the forms , as the others talked a little off to the side , Clair glanced over at what Orlean was writing and suddenly reacted with a sharp , deep breath . " What ? " she asked him quietly . " You 're two months older than I am ! " he whispered . " Me ? ! " She looked over to make sure of what he had written . " Well , we 're both just getting started into seventeen . ? Do two months really matter ? " " ? No . It 's just a surprise , an ' , ? " " In any real and true way , Clair , you 're a hundred years older , and smarter , than me. "  | " ? Well , " he grinned , " we both just survived the shock , so I guess it 's okay . " When Bishop Hartkee was ready for the small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the warm parlor , with a Book of Mormon and a Bible that the bishop placed on that same table . 1 le read some written words from each of his two Good Boolcs . Then , very sincerely , he quietly spoke his own words about Marriage , about Life and Happiness , about Forsaking All Others , and about being Together in Sickness and Health . And finally , most important , he spoke of Loving and Cherishing , until Death Shall You Part . Though they simply felt each other and their nearness so much that they did n't really hear most of the quiet words , Clair and Orlean both managed to murmur " I do " at the right time . " With this ring , I do thee wed . " Sherril gave Clair the simple gold ring they 'd bought at the last minute in Salt Lake , and Clair put it on Orlean 's finger . It seemed to fit easily and securely , and to belong there . " I now pronounce you Man and Wife . You may kiss the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And then it was done . While Bishop Hartkee 's wife was trying unsuccessfully to persuade Sherril and Vivianne into having another glass of cranberry juice , Clair spoke to the bishop . " ? How much , do I owe you , sir ? " " The marriage license itself costs two dollars . " " I see . " Clair paid him the two dollars . Then , with a glance at ( ) rlean , he said , " But , ? there 's got t ' be some cost t ' you , sir . " Bishop Hartkee shrugged , looking vaguely down toward the table . " Well , in cases of marriages like this , here in my  | home , I usually just charge the new husband a minimum fee of five dollars . " Clair and Orlean looked at each other , and Clair slowly took out his very last remaining money , the five-dollar bill , and handed it to him . " It  --  was worth more , sir . " Bishop Hartkee took the five-dollar bill and said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There 's another thing that I usually do at a time like this . " " Yes , sir ? " Clair said . " I also usually give that same five dollars to the new bride , as her first wedding present . " He pushed the bill into Orlean 's hand . " Now both of you go on and get out of here . It 's gettin ' late for a Mormon bishop . And God bless the two of you . " They drove to Sherril 's where there was a party already started . Melva and Margaret had walked up with Al and Darrell , the four of them bringing a cake Melva had baked . Miles and Evelyn had driven in , and Wayne and Guila were there . And tonight , there were two bottles of champagne , though Orlean 's sisters , and Al , settled for soft drinks . Orlean was so happily and explosively filled up with the idea of having just been married to Clair that she did n't even quite know or care where she was , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glass of champagne that was poured for her . All she knew was that at one point she turned to Clair and said softly , " Can we go home ? " And he said equally softly , " Yes . " Sherril took them down , and left with a small wave of his hand as he drove away up the street . They walked toward the door through some new-fallen snow , its hardening surface crunching back coldly at them under the weight of their steps .  | At the door she stopped and quietly said , " ? I 've never , ? gone into a home , like this , before . " " ? Neither have I. I 'm supposed t ' carry ya , I guess . " " Do you want to ? " " Well , ? yes . If I can do it without slippin ' on the ice out here , an ' injurin ' us both on our wedding night . " He opened the door , lifted her easily and stepped inside , then kissed her gently and put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lamp on the table . As the light glowed higher , Orlean shut the door against the cold and looked around her . There was one frostbitten window near a small sink . The old potbellied stove was giving a small hint of faint yellow heat glowing bravely and dimly from the uneven cracks of the stove 's square door . A small bed , a wobbly table and two chairs were in the center of the room . And other than that , only the Icerosene lamp on the table , that Clair had just lighted . " It sure still ai n't much . " He shook out the match as it started to burn his fingers . " Clair , " she said , softly . " Yeah ? " " ? I 've never loved any place as much as this , in my life . "  | IN TIME , spring began to make its gentle but irresistible advances toward the icy giant of winter . And then , almost as though it had all magically happened in one day , winter was gone , leaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reminder that it was never defeated forever . And then summer was suddenly there , balancing the past winter 's freezing cold and ice with its newly arrived blistering heat and dust . The time was passing so quickly for Clair and Orlean that they hardly noticed it . Neither of them had ever been so happy or so busy in their lives . And September , the time the baby was due , seemed to be rushing toward them with unbe-lievable speed . With Clair working seven days a week , usually about a ten-hour day , they did n't have much time together , but the time they did have was constantly new and warm and rich . From his very first day of working on the railroad , Clair had begun to study any books on electricity and railroading that he could find , as often as he could at night by the light of the kerosene lamp on the table . And whenever he could , Sherril , a master electrician , would stop by to help him in his learning . One night while she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sudden , inner movement for the first time in her swollen stomach and almost dropped the plate in her hands . " Clair ! " she said . " The baby moved ! "  | Looking up with startled eyes from where he was studying at the table , he really did drop the book in his hands , and hurried anxiously to her . " Are you all right ? ! Does it hurt ? ! " " ? No . " She put her hand to her stomach . " It just , ? surprised the dickens out of me . " " Here , sit down . " " No , honestly I 'm fine . " " You sure ? " " Yes , just fine . " After a moment he took a deep breath . " ? What did it feel like ? " She paused thoughtfully . " It felt like a hiccup , ? only farther down . " Finally , both convinced and relieved , Clair grinned . " Do you think it was you , or the baby , who hiccupped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Let me finish the dishes . " She turned to the sink and he went back to his book . Working with her back to him , she said quietly , " Clair ? " " Yeah ? " " ? It wo n't be long , now . " " No , it sure wo n't . " Then she continued , still quietly . " I saw your mother today , on Main Street . " He lowered the book and looked toward where she was drying dishes , her back still to him . " ? Oh ? " " She crossed the street , so we would n't pass by each other . " " Maybe , she just did n't see you , or even know who you were . But , ? she does act in , kinda funny ways , sometimes . " Orlean finished drying the last cup and put it on the sink before turning slowly toward him . " Clair , why have n't we ever been in their home ? Why , ? were n't they even at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honey . Through Wayne . "  | " Oh . ? I 've always known , of course , that there 's something terribly wrong between you . And a lot of times I 've had to bite my tongue to keep from asking you to tell me about it . " He shrugged , frowning sadly . " I , ? would n't even really know , quite where , ' r how t ' begin . " " Oh , darling ! " she said quickly and gently . " I 'm not asking you now , either ! But , they 're about to become grandparents for the first time in their lives . And , ? they 'll be the only grandparents our child will have . " She paused briefly . " It would be so unfair for them not to have a chance to know and love each other . " Clair nodded silently at her words , but Orlean could see the look of deep , thoughtful sadness in his eyes . So she smiled at him , her smile dismissing the subject , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " ? Well then , dear husband , have you learned very much sitting here with these books , while I 've been slaving over a hot sink ? " A faint grin began to toy at the edges of Clair 's mouth . " ? At this point , dear wife , there is no question but what I know everything there is in the world to know about electricity . " " Everything ? " " Absolutely . I have now finally even figured out how t ' spell electricity , ' which is , generally , considered t ' be the hardest part of all . " " ? Wow . " She nodded gravely . " How come , with all you know about electricity , dear husband , we are still sitting here with a kerosene lamp ? " " Because with all I know , dear wife , it 's safer . " Orlean picked up a slender blue notebook that Clair had been writing in , and opening it read , " Clair Huffaker . Signal Department . ' " She tilted her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good , so far . " " Thought you 'd like it . "  | Then , with a growing frown , she continued reading . " Thickness Gauge of Relay . ? Ten-thousandths to Twelvethousandths of Trunion Play . ? Fifteen-thousandths from Armature to Cores . ? Ten-thousandths in Wipe from Pickup to Normal . ' " " It gets even more fascinatin ' , " Clair told her . She shook her head slightly and continued reading . " Thirtythousandths between Carbon and Contact on Polar Relay . ? Polish Trunions and Adjust Carbons . ' " Then she closed the notebook and put it down . " ? I think I 've learned enough for one night . " Clair 's grin had become broad and easy . " At least ya know what I really am , now . I 'm an official Carbon-Adjuster an ' Trunion-Polisher . " " It certainly is an honor to meet you . " " Do n't let it go t ' your head . " About a month later , fairly late in his workday , Clair got an order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tracks to the mine at Bingham and repair a relay signal that had been reported out of order . This was the part of his job that Clair liked best . The One-man was a small , completely open , gas-powered inspection and emergency vehicle that could literally fly along the tracks when it was opened up to its top speed . Except for its four , small iron wheels , it looked almost like a Model A Sedan with the car 's body taken off and its seats removed . It was just big enough to carry a limited amount of emergency equipment in the front and one or sometimes two men standing at the back and driving it . Clair signed out for the tools he 'd need and walked up the path with them to the sidetracks where a One-man was waiting . He checked the gas and oil , and then started the engine , idling it at first .  | A little later he was speeding up the gradually sloping railroad tracks toward far-off Bingham , the cooling September air playing with his hair under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was a warning signal of a train coming down toward him , and he pulled his One-man off onto a spur to wait for it to pass . A few minutes later there was a growing thunder in the distance , and the earth began to tremble slightly . Then the ore train came roaring into sight through a rocky canyon on its swift , downhill trip to the mill at Magna . Behind the big , powerful locomotive there were about fifty huge iron cars , each loaded high with large boulders of rough , rock ore from the mine that were to be broken down , crushed and processed at the mill . As the massive train rumbled by , now shaking the earth so strongly that the One-man 's engine stalled , Clair waved off toward it , and the fireman and engineer on the passing locomotive waved back . And then , in a final , receding thunder of sound and speed , the train had gone by and the way was clear again . Clair backed his One-man off the spur onto the main track @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later , he entered the first tunnel , the entrance signals telling him that it was all clear . It was a long , dark tunnel , running from one end to the other about five miles under a high ridge of mountains . He came out of it , briefly , into the daylight at the top part of the town of Bingham . Here , steep , high cliffs fell almost straight down into a razor-like narrowness at the bottom of the long canyon , where often there was only room between the cliffs for one small , mountain-hanging house and the tiny road itself winding patiently up toward the hidden mine above . Clair had heard that Bingham was the longest , skinniest town in the world , and from this present point of view there was every reason to believe it was true . Soon he was into the second , shorter tunnel . And when he  | emerged from it , the world suddenly , instantly became a thousand times larger to his eyes . He came out on the " Pit , " the largest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , gigantic hole , huge enough to have taken mountains out of the way , that over the years had been dug into the earth . On any one of its countless , down-reaching , railroaded levels , an entire ore train at the far side of the Pit looked tiny enough to pick up in one hand . An immense , ore-dislodging and mountain-shattering blast of dynamite could be set off at the other end of the Pit , and it could only be recognized by a finger-tip puff of quickly disappearing white smoke and , seconds later , a vague , distant sensation that was more of a faint curiosity than a sound . Clair drove his One-man down to the seventh level and found the faulty signal , a yellow-flasher indicating caution . The problem was simply a wire dangling away from its contact , probably jarred loose by the millions of tons of ore trains constantly lumbering by . Clair had it fixed in minutes , and started his One-man just in time to get up the track and out of the way of a huge ore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the now working yellow-flasher . By the time Clair got back down through the five-milelong tunnel , where it was eternally pitch-black night , the sun had set and daylight was almost gone . And he at last brought his One-man to a stop at the mill in the full darkness of night . He walked down to the Signal Office and filled out his report , then went out to the nearby toolshed to check in his equipment . Old man Kilmer , who ran the toolshed , carefully and methodically checked in Clair 's gear . He then , almost as an afterthought , said , " Oh , say , Huffaker . There was a message come in f'r you . " " Yeah ? " " Yeah . ? Seems like y'r wife 's havin ' a baby . " " Goddamnit , why did n't ya tell me ? ! "  | " I just did . " But by then Clair was already gone . He raced headlong down the long , dark path toward the dim lights of Magna in the distance below @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was heating at the inside of his chest savagely , and his heavy , rapid breaths were burning and choking against each other in his throat . But still he kept on running , and the few people he passed on Main Street looked at him curiously . A little later he turned up on Fourth East , and finally , almost ready to fall down , he arrived at his small home . Melva was standing just outside the door , and light was coming from the window . Clair came to a stop in front of her and managed to say , " ? How is she ? " " She looks a lot better than you do . " Melva smiled . " ? It 's a boy . " The door opened and Dr. Sloan came out , ready to leave . " Fine boy , Clair . Why do n't you go on in ? " Both he and Melva walked away , and Clair , taking off his cap , opened the door and stepped inside . Orlean smiled quietly up at him from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life wrapped in a blanket in her arms . Cap in hand , Clair stepped slowly over to the bed . And finally , in a low voice he said , " ? Well . " " ? Everything 's just fine , " she said . " ? Would you like to meet your son ? " Clair reached down and touched the sleeping boy 's forehead gently . " ? I guess we 'll have t ' teach ' im t ' shake hands . " She smiled again . " Melva was here all the time , and then the doctor came . It was a lot easier than I 'd thought it would be . " Clair nodded slightly , still a little exhausted and dazed . " ? How old is he ? " " About two hours . "  | He leaned down and kissed her softly . Then he said , " Could ya drink some coffee , if I made it ? " " Sure . " A little later they were sipping coffee , and Clair had pulled a chair up beside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said , " now that we know its gender , we 'll have t ' give the little rascal a name . Actually , I 've thought of at least a hundred . But I kinda think Wayne ' would be nice . " " Clair , " she said . " Yeah ? " " No , I mean the name Clair . ' That 's the name I want to give him . " Frowning and deadly serious , he said , " You got t ' be jokin ' , honey . That 'd be a terrible thing t ' do to a two-hour-old kid . " She just smiled slightly , without answering . " Listen , " Clair went on . " D ' you know how much trouble a kid can get into with a sissy name like that ? Without even tryin ' ? " There was still no answer . " B'sides , even worse , that 'd make him a Junior . An ' I do n't want no kid a ' mine t ' have t ' go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Junior ' on top a ' that . " He hesitated . " How ' bout John , ' r Robert , ? ' r Chester ? " " Darling , " she said softly and quietly . " You can call him whatever you want . ? But I 'm going to call him Clair . " " Well , " he said with a faint , slightly defeated grin , " that could get t ' be kinda confusin ' for ' im . " " And being your son , he 'll never be a Junior ' to anybody . ? Except to one man . You . " Clair reached over and touched the still sleeping baby 's forehead once more . " ? T , : e size he is right now , I guess the name Little Clair ' would n't be too far wrong . "  | She blinked back the beginning of a tear . " ? Then , it 's all right , with you ? " " Yeah . ? Sure it is . " " ? Thank you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his . " ? Ya know , honey . ? If they made butterflies outta iron , ? you 'd sure be one of ' em . " I Two months later , Melva stopped by in the early evening on one of her daily visits . Orlean was wearing her good blue dress with the white polka dots on it . Her hair was richly brushed and held softly with a yellow ribbon . She was getting Little Clair ready for something special , putting a red , knitted cap on the boy that Evelyn had made for him . " Well , " Melva said , " it looks like he 's gettin ' ready for his first big night out on the town . " Orlean adjusted the red-knit cap at a rakish angle on his head and said , " As soon as Clair gets home , the three of us are all going to go meet his parents . ? This little tyke 's grandparents . " " That 's nice , ' Lean . " " flair 's really excited . " Orlean 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wayne sort of had to make an appointment for us to go see them . " " Well , it 's not too hard t ' see , that Clair and his folks are n't all that close . " Orlean tickled the baby under his chubby cheek , making a face at him , and he grinned back in toothless appreciation . " You 'll make them get back together , wo n't you ! " Clair got home a few minutes after Melva had left , and he was not only excited and nervous , but exuberantly happy about something . He kissed Orlean , then growled into the baby 's ear until it was giggling convulsively .  | Finally Orlean found herself laughing helplessly along with the contagious laughter of the boy , and then she at last managed to say , " ? Are you going to go on growling at that poor child all night ? " " My dear woman , " Clair said , kissing the boy 's ear and standing up . " You are not speaking to an Electrician 's Helper anymore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my experience , " he grinned , " I have found that life comes in two flavors , good and bad , ? with maybe a dash of pistachio in-between . " " When did you make that up ? " " Just now . " He hugged her , sweeping her slightly off her feet . " Honey , I 'm an Electrician 's Assistant ! And I 'm not making twenty-four dollars a week anymore , but twenty-eight ! " " Oh ! " she said , hugging him back . " And what a wonderful time for it to happen ! Your parents will be so proud of you tonight ! " " ? I hope so . " Clair hugged her again , then washed quickly and changed into his blue J.C . Penney suit . " You sure are getting fancy , " Orlean said . " Have to , t ' keep up with the two a ' you . " They walked the eight or nine zigzagging blocks across town to where Clair 's parents lived . Clair carried the baby all the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he handed the small bundle of sleeping life to Orlean . Then , neither hard nor soft , but just firmly , he knocked at the door . Mr. Huffaker answered the door , paunchy and uneasy , and smiling at the same time in his shirt sleeves . " Well , well , well , just come right on in and make yourselves right at home . You 'll be little Orlean . I 've known your family for years . What a cute little fella ya got there . "  | " How are you , Dad ? " Clair said . " Oh , just fine , just fine ! Enzy 'll be out in just a minute , now . " And then , suddenly , he seemed to run out of any other words to say . They were all standing in the middle of the parlor , now wrapped in the middle of the sudden silence . Orlean finally smiled and said , " ? I 'll just put the baby down , Mr. Huffaker . " She went to the sofa and laid him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pillow that was there . And then Enzy came into the room . The first thing that she seemed to see was the baby on the sofa . She walked directly to the child , ignoring everything else , leaned down and jerked the pillow out from under its head . " He 'll dirty it ! And this is my good pillow from San Diego ! " She glared at her husband . " You should know better than let her put him on it , Frank ! " " Well , I did n't think , ? " " You did n't think ! " She turned , and leaving the room said , " I 'll go get him an old one ! " In the stunned silence , Orlean picked the baby up and said very quietly , " ? Let 's go , Clair . " Clair looked at his father and said , " It 's best , Dad . " The older man 's heavy-lidded gaze fell to the floor . " ? Maybe so . " On the walk home , Clair took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arm , walking close to him on the dark street . " Honey , " he said . " ? I 'm sorry . " " ? Do n't feel too bad , Clair . " " I 'm fine . ? Just , kinda worried about you . " She held his arm tighter , walking even closer to him on the deeply shadowed street . " Somehow , tonight made me think of some words that come from way back in my memory , and make me know more about why you 're as strong as you are . "  | " What are the words ? " " ? I asked God for strength , ? and He gave me problems . " And then , soon , they were home . Another winter , and then another , came and went , and all the seasons were filled with rich , warm times . The boy learned to walk early , and soon after that decided that the only way to get from one place to another was at a dead run . Soon he was talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his words came out of him on a dead run also , excited and mispronounced and spilling swiftly out of him in an eager stream of enthusiasm . In the spring following that second winter , two important things happened . First , the savings they 'd been putting aside reached the unheard of sum of three-hundred dollars , enough for a downpayment toward buying a two , or maybe even a three-room house . And second , Orlean became pregnant again . To celebrate , they left Little Clair with Melva one night and went with Sherril and Vivianne to the Hotel Utah in Salt Lake for dinner . On the way home , Orlean was half dozing against Clair 's arm in the back seat of the car when he leaned down and touched her forehead with his lips . " Honey ? " " ? Mmm ? " " Try t ' make it a girl this time . " " Why ? " " I 'd sure hate if have another guy named Clair , all in one family . " " ? I 'll try . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next morning Clair got another order for an emergency repair job at the Bingham mine . " What 's the trouble ? " he asked the dispatcher.  | " Hell , I ai n't real sure . Looks like there 's about three signals ai n't workin ' up t ' the Pit . Might be a whole series a ' relays on the blink . " He shrugged . " Just go on up t ' the Pit an ' check ' er out , if it takes ya all day . " " Okay . " A little later Clair was speeding up the sunny , windswept tracks on his One-man . About fifteen miles along the way a signal warned of an approaching train , and he drove off onto a spur . Soon the giant locomotive and its quarter-mile-long trail of huge ore cars thundered swiftly and deafeningly by , shaking the earth as it passed . Clair and the engineer waved to each other , and within a few minutes Clair was flying up along the tracks again on his One-man . Still making good time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the five-mile tunnel . The signal showed the tunnel was clear , so he sped into the entrance and was almost instantly surrounded by the eternal , black night within t he long , narrow tunnel . Clair switched on the single , small headlight on the Onem an . Not that it did much good , but he could at least see a few yards of the gradually winding track before him , and could make out the darkly-damp , glistening walls rushing by a few feet to each side of him . It was hard to estimate time and space within this unchanging , endless darkness , but Clair guessed he was about halfway through the tunnel when , for no knowable reason , he had a chilling , terrifying premonition of something being in the tunnel before him . Perhaps it was the tiniest hint of a faintly changing rhythm and feeling of the rails beneath the small iron wheels of the One-man . But by then it was too late . And what happened next took place in less than ten seconds .  | Now the earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noise , a million crashing thunderbolts of screaming noise from the darkness ahead striking Clair with such force that it seemed the incredible power of sound itself would tear away his fiercely straining grip on the One-man and hurl him off of it . An instant later there was the light . A giant , dazzling ball of flaming white light that suddenly loomed into sight and sped toward him hugely and blindingly from around the curving track ahead . In a brief moment of icy , calm clarity that grimly accepted inescapable death thundering down upon him , Clair realized that the signal relay problems were not at the Pit only , but that they extended many miles down the track , to and including the warning signal at the tunnel entrance . And as the locomotive hurtled toward him , he realized in that same instant that not only was there no time to jump , but with the tunnel walls so close to each side of him , there was no place to jump . And then there was the horrendous crash . Yet to Clair , suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His world simply went violently , soundlessly and , mercifully , painlessly insane . He was flying and spinning wildly through the air , smashing up against the tunnel ceiling , then smashing again crushingly against the side of a giant , speeding ore car , then careening off and : crashing into the wall of the tunnel . And then , oblivion . In the cab of the huge , speeding locomotive , there had only been the vague sensation of a faint , brief thumping . Cupping his hand against the engineer 's ear , and shouting as loud as he could to be heard , the fireman yelled , " You feel somethin ' , just then ? ! "  | The engineer nodded and shouted back , " Last train musts dropped a big rock off onta the rail ! " Somehow , lying on his back , Clair opened his eyes numbly and saw monstrous ore cars thundering above him , their giant iron wheels sparking and screeching by so close to his shoulder and head that he could have reached out and touched them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it belonged to someone else , he noticed that one of his legs was lying across the track , being run over again and again by the huge , screaming iron wheels . With one hand , he tugged weakly at the bloody pants encasing what was left of his leg , finally pulling it from the track . Looking up at the ore cars roaring overhead , Clair wondered vaguely if one of the big , high-loaded boulders would fall off and crush him . And then , again , oblivion .  | THERE WAS a loud , fast knocking at the door , and Orlea crossed the room , from where she was taking a loaf of fresh baked bread from the stove , to answer it . Sherril was standing in the dark there , the muscles in hi usually smiling face held so tight that he almost looked like stranger . Wayne was just behind him , eyes already red , bu fighting bravely against further tears . " What is it ? " Orlean asked quietly , though the look c them almost made her heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say . Already Orlean was feeling those bitter , stinging tears tha flow backward , but her eyes stayed dry and her voice wa calm . " Is he dead ? " Sherril wet his lips . " Do n't know . ? He had a real ba accident in the main tunnel . They just told me and I come ar got Wayne , an ' you . " " Where is he ? " " Ambulance is takin ' him t ' Saint Mark 's in Salt Lake . Y better get ready as fast as ya can . " " I 'm ready . " Orlean scooped up Little Clair from his cri and grabbed a blanket to wrap him in on her way out th door . They walked quickly to Sherril 's Model A seda : parked in the street with its motor still running . Wayne helped Orlean into the front seat with Little Clai in her lap , then hurried to get into the back seat as Sherr : shifted into gear and sped away . ISI  | Arranging the blanket warmingly around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and quiet voice , " ? Do you know what happened ? " " Not a whole lot . " Sherril slowed very slightly , and then sped on through a stop sign . " Him an ' his One-man got run into by a ore-train comin ' down outta Bingham . " He rubbed the back of his hand roughly against his cheek . " Nobody even knew about it for a damn long time . It was a goddamned miracle that he was still alive when they finally found ' im . " Orlean said in a low voice , " ? He 's awfully strong . " Speeding along , Sherril glanced briefly at Orlean , then turned his attention back to the road ahead . " ? You know I sure do love you , Orlean . And all that any of us can do right now is t ' hope . ? But from what I been told , chances 're awful slim of him even makin ' it t ' the hospital . " He hesitated and cleared his throat slightly . " ? Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all I 'm tryin ' t ' say , honey . " Again she said , in a low voice , " ? He 's awful strong . " And nothing more was said until they got to the Hospital of Saint Mark in Salt Lake . Sherril and Wayne each held one of the main double-doors open to let Orlean carry her sleeping boy into the hospital entrance , where there was the instant , heavy and nauseating smell of chloroform . Sherril whispered briefly to the stiffly starched nurse at the reception desk , and then he told Orlean and Wayne in a hushed voice , " He 's here . ? He 's still alive . " Sherril took a deep breath . " He 's bein ' operated on right now . " Orlean seemed to only be able to say one single thing , and she now repeated it quietly for the third time . " ? He 's very strong . " " Nurse says there 's a waitin ' room , " Sherril said . " Up on the third floor . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window and a few straight-backed chairs in it . And here the  | constant odor of chloroform in the air was even more sickening . Orlean sat down with Little Clair in her lap , and the men sat near her . " Can I , ? ya want me t ' hold him awhile ? " Wayne asked . She shook her head silently . It was a long , almost wordless night . Sherril chain-smoked cigarettes , and once in a while he walked down the hall to whisper to a night nurse sitting there , but she never seemed to know anything . Sometime after midnight he said softly . " ? I guess no news is good news . He must be holdin ' on . " And then , " ? You okay , ' Lean ? " She nodded , but still said nothing . Daylight was beginning to show faintly through the single window when a haggard , slender man of about fifty , wearing a rumpled gray smock , quietly entered the room . " Mrs. Huffaker ? " he asked . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as can be expected . " He hesitated . " But there is a , ? problem . " At their voices , or perhaps the slightly increased tension in Orlcan 's arms , the little boy began to wake up . Orlean handed him toward Wayne and said , " Please . " Realizing that she did n't want the child to hear , and perhaps understand , Wayne took him gently , and Orlean and Sherril went out of the room with the other man . In the corridor he turned to them , briefly rubbing his exhausted eyes with one hand . " I 'm Dr. Hughes . " " Will he live ? " she asked . " It 's too early to know for certain . Frankly , it 's a miracle that he 's survived through the night . We 've had to give him enormous amounts of blood , but he seems to be reacting well to it . He has a concussion , and several fractures . " Orlean took a long , deep breath . " ? The problem ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should come to my office and sit down . " " I 'm all right , Doctor . " " Very well . ? His right leg is practically completely severed , a few inches below the knee . I 'm afraid we 'll have to remove it . " After a moment , she said , " ? There must be some chance of saving it , ? is n't there ? " " Mrs. Huffaker , I have to be honest with you . It is n't a ? clean severance . It 's rather as though three or four inches of the bone and muscle tissue have been completely pulverized and crushed . I believe one or more train wheels passed over it . There 's a very real danger of gangrene , or blood poisoning . Not to even mention countless months in the hospital , plus the huge expenses . And given only one remote chance in a million of saving it , amputation is medically the only possible answer . " She looked at him quietly . " ? Is it my decision ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ? Try to save his leg . " There was a long moment of silence that was finally broken by a short , frightened wail from the child in the waiting room behind them , who now awakened and was bewildered by his strange surroundings . Orlean turned and went back in to comfort him . Sherril said , " I 'm his brother , Doctor . ? How come , in the name a ' God , did n't he bleed t ' death all that time he was in the tunnel ? " " He would have , except that his pantleg somehow became twisted around his thigh tightly enough to form an accidental but fairly effective tourniquet . " Sherril shook his head at this and exhaled a long , hard breath . " Boy , seems ya sure ca n't never tell what this old world 's got t ' offer , good or bad , at any damn minute . "  | Dr. Hughes nodded very faintly and tiredly . " His concussion alone could have been fatal . Your brother has an incredible will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ briefly back toward the waiting room , where Orlean had now soothed the frightened child . " That 's all she said the whole night . ? About him bein ' so strong . " I ) r . Hughes looked toward the room with thoughtful eyes . " I low old is that little girl he 's married to ? " " Nineteen , I think . " " ? Your brother 's not the only strong one in that young family . " Then he turned and walked slowly away , down the long hospital corridor . A few minutes later , while it was still before sunup , Melva and Margaret came into the waiting room . They 'd just learned about the accident from Al , who had dropped them at the hospital and gone on in the car he 'd borrowed from a friend to tell Miles and Evelyn . As Sherril started to quietly tell them about how Clair was , Melva gently took Little Clair into her own lap , and Margaret began to unwrap a still-warm bowl of oatmeal that they 'd brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring herself to listen one more time right now , to spoken words telling again of what had happened to her Clair . She stood up , faintly aware of the muscles in her back aching from the long night of sitting in the straight-backed chair . " Can Wayne or me go an ' get ya somethin ' , ' Lean ? " Sherril asked quietly . " No thanks , " she murmured . " I 'll just walk down the hall , for a little bit . " As she approached the desk on the third floor , the night nurse said , " Mrs. Huffaker ? "  | " Yes ? " " I just got a paper that you have to sign . " Orlean took the piece of paper , but could n't make herself concentrate on the finely printed wording . " ? What is it ? " " It 's a regular form , holding the hospital and doctors blameless in case any problems should develop with your husband , later . " " I 'm sorry , " Orlean said numbly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The nurse took the form back from her and studied it for a moment . " What it 's mostly about is right here . ? ill-advised medical procedure , due to the high contingent possibility of gangrenous infection . ' " She glanced at Orlean quietly , and then read a little more , explaining to Orlean . " ? You wo n't let them perform an operation that they think they should . And as the patient 's next of kin , you 've got final say . " " Yes ? " " If you do n't sign this , they 'll go ahead with  --  the surgery . And if you do sign it , ? then the full responsibility for whatever happens , is yours . " She looked at Orlean with troubled eyes . " Usually these here form things are about an outbreak of chicken pox or something . But this one 's so important , ? I wish I had n't even been the one that read it to you . ? You ought to talk to somebody , to friends , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they ca n't cut his leg off . Is that right ? " " That 's right . But they 're good men , afraid of gangrene , and ? " Orlean took the paper and picked up a pen from the desk . With a trembling hand she signed it , and then handed it hack to the nurse . Perhaps not meaning to , the nurse caused one more , final pang of fear and doubt . She said quietly , " ? Did you ever see a man with gangrene ? " And Orlean , with the very last of her emotional strength ,  | said , " No . But you never saw my Clair on a motorcycle , or waltzing. " loving away from any more talk , Orlean walked at another angle in the hospital . She came to a staircase and went down it , and then down another , and then there was a door . She went out and found herself alone at the back of the building . There was no one near , and no one in the stands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And the growing brightness of sun had still not yet come up over the mountains to t he east , so that there was a calm , darkish-gray light in the sky above . The half-moon was still there , pale and timid , ready to retreat before the coming light . And here and there around it , tiny sparks of stars struggled bravely to survive a moment longer . Alone and very afraid , she looked into that strange , morning sky , knowing that she had never seen another quite like it , nur ever would again . " ? Please , God , " she said , gazing into the high-above heavens and speaking only in her mind . " Let him be well . " The stars winked back at her with small , twinkling and winking promises , but no real answers , and the dim , silver moon said nothing at all . So she looked at the deeper void , in between the lights . " Please God , " she said again , speaking once more only in 0 her mind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ? that I love more than you ? I do n't know , but t fiat must be a good thing on a God level . To be able to make something better , or more loved than yourself . " Right now , he 's dying upstairs . ? Please , Dear Lord , do n't let him die . " I 'm a good Mormon , God , and he 's not . And I 'm willing to trade me for him , so it would probably be a pretty fair thing for you , if you 'd like to consider that .  | " But your stars and the moon are n't paying attention to anything I 'm trying to say , and maybe you do n't have the time to , either . They 're starting to go away . " I 'll tell you one last thing , God . ? If you decide to let him live , you wo n't be sorry . I 'll promise to come with him , when you choose the time , and then you 'll have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The twinkling stars were now long dimmed and gone , and the moon was fading away as the sun started to top the eastern mountains . And now , finally , Orlean stopped speaking within herself to her suddenly very near God . Never before , even in church , had she felt His presence so invisibly close and so real as it was out here under the softly , slowly changing sky . After a long moment , she turned and went quietly back into the hospital . For nearly a week Clair stayed near the thin border between life and death , sometimes weakening , then fighting back with some feeble inner strength , though in all that time he never regained consciousness . Finally , Dr. Hughes came by the waiting room and said to Orlean , " If you do n't get a little rest , I 'll have to hospitalize you too . " " ? I 'm fine . " " I doubt if you 've had more than two hours ' sleep a night , if that . ? What about your little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of him . " Dr. Hughes sighed and bit his lip slightly . " Look , young lady , will you promise me to go home and get a good , long sleep , if I break a regulation or two , and let you see your husband ? " Orlean stood up quickly . " Oh , yes . "  | They walked farther back along the corridors than Orlean had ever been before , and a nurse on duty near some double doors frowned up at them , but seeing Dr. Hughes , said nothing . Before entering a final room , the doctor said , " We can only stay a minute , and be very quiet . " They went inside silently . There were many beds in the long room , most of them hidden from sight by surrounding cloth drapes that fell from the ceiling to the floor . Nurses and a few doctors were moving about with nearly soundless efficiency . Dr. Hughes separated the fourth curtain on the right , and they entered the small cubicle it formed . Clair was lying flat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face and one arm exposed . A thin tube led down from an overhanging bottle to a needle in that arm . His forehead was wrapped in a bandage that went completely around his head . And though his right leg could n't be seen , the swelling of the sheet there showed how heavily bandaged it was . His breathing was almost inaudible , and irregular . Silently , Orlean stepped a little closer to look down at his face . It was so pale , and heartbreakingly weak . She stood there looking down at him for a long , silent moment . And then with no warning , no other movement of his face or lips , Clair 's eyes opened for the first time , and he looked up at Orlean . Dr. Hughes inhaled sharply , in his sudden surprise . Clair 's eyes stayed open for only two or three seconds , studying Orlean with totally clear awareness . But that brief time was long enough for him to see her quick smile . And then his eyes finally , slowly , closed again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved away . The moment they were out and starting back down the  | corridor , Dr. Hughes shook his head wonderingly , " My God ! " " He woke up ! " Orlean said happily . " He knew me ! " " But it happened just at that very moment when you were standing by him for the first time . " The doctor shook his head again . " My colleagues might consider me certifiably insane , but it looked to me as though , somehow , in some unexplainable way , he simply felt that you were standing there near him . " She thought about this for a quiet moment and then said , " ? Doctor ? ? Is n't his waking up , even for just that little while , a real good sign ? " " Ye. , , it is . It 's not a guarantee of anything , most certainly including his bad leg . But it is very encouraging . " They arrived near the waiting room , and he added , " You promised to get some sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ? And then I 've got an awful lot to do . " She touched his arm softly . " Thank you , Doctor . " In the next three weeks Orlean could only see Clair twice , and each time for just a few seconds . Once he slept through the brief visit . On the other visit his eyes opened , but he was too weak to speak . All he could do was smile faintly when she touched his hand with hers . And then finally , early one evening , Dr. Hughes came into the waiting room and said , " I 've just been talking to him . " " You have ? " He nodded . " Your husband seems to think , all of a sudden , that he 's a healthy young lion . We 've moved him into another ward , where less intensive care is needed , and visitation privileges are better . " " Can I see him ? ? Talk to him ? " He nodded again . " For perhaps ten or fifteen minutes . But if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . "  | A few minutes later , her heart pounding with quick eagerness , she walked up to beside Clair 's bed . He looked at her and grinned faintly . " ? Hey , there . " She sat silently near the bed and took his left hand in her own , a warm , good dampness growing in her eyes . After a moment he grinned again . " ? Us Trunion Polishers , ? sure can tend t ' be , kinda clumsy , ? sometimes . " She squeezed his hand very gently . " ? Even downright reckless , sometimes , ? if you ask me . " His weak hand squeezed back faintly . " I do n't know , because of all that stuff wrapped around it . But they tell me my right leg , ? might not be too handy , anymore . " " Oh , Clair ! " She lifted his hand and leaned forward to kiss it , tears suddenly coming down her cheeks . " It 'll be all right ! You 'll be just fine ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the pillow . " Hey ! ? You 're the one  --  ai n't supposed t ' cry , unless you 're happy . " " I 'm crying because I 'm finally talking to you ! " " I know that , honey . " His voice now became a little stronger . " An ' I can tell ya for sure that I 'm gon na live all right . But what with Little Clair , an ' the next baby comin ' , I got t ' get up an ' movin ' around , one way or another . ? I ai n't at all sure that we c'n afford the luxury a ' tryin ' t ' hold onto my goddamned , beat-up old right leg . " " Do n't say anything like that , " she said quietly . " Do n't even think it . " " The doctor told me the odds , honey , an ' the likely costs . ? We got t ' think a ' the family first . " She squeezed his hand hard this time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make the whole thing work . We 've got that three hundred dollars saved . And the Copper Company is paying you fifteen dollars a week compensation while you 're here . " " They are ? "  | " They did n't want to , but Sherril went with me to the State Industrial Commission , and they have to . " " Well , I 'll be damned . " " And I 've moved close to you in Salt Lake , and got a job . " " You 've what ? ! " He almost lifted his head from the pillow . " They 're getting more telephones here in town every day , and they need operators . I took a two-day course , and I 'm earning between twelve and fourteen dollars a week . " After a frowning , stunned silence , he said , " What about Little Clair ? " " Your Grandma Brown offered to take care of him while I 'm working . ? And she did a pretty darn good job of taking care of you , when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he muttered . " ? There nothin ' you ai n't thought of ? " " Not much , " she said . " ? I 'm terrific . " He looked at her for a long time . " I guess you knew I would n't be too happy about that leg bein ' cut off . And if this works out  --  I guess , maybe , I 'll owe you a dance . " Smiling at him , she said , " Could the music be , I 'll Take You Home Again , Kathleen ' ? " Suddenly , and very quickly , he was beginning to tire . " ? You 're forgettin ' , " he said , " ? for us it 's  --  I 'll Take You Home Again  --  Orlean . ' " " ? I 've never forgotten , darling . " His eyes starting to close , but a tiny grin working at the edges of his mouth , he muttered , " While you 're out doin ' all them things , ? there 's just one helpful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this hospital , ? that you ca n't do . " " What 's that ? " she asked softly . " I c'n , ? take up knittin ' . " And then he drifted away , falling into a deep , heavy sleep . But his breathing was strong and evenly measured . She gently put his hand back down on the bed . Then she stood up and walked quietly from the room .  | CLAIR HAD never known until now what a deadly enemy time can be , or what a cruel prison a hospital bed can be . Long , endless weeks finally became deadly months , and then even spanned the seasons themselves , until a cold , deep winter had come and was now almost gone . It was nearly a year later , on a dreary , late afternoon , when Clair raised up in bed and struggled to arrange a pillow behind him . Then , finally sitting upright and leaning back against the pillow , he reached for a cigarette on the nightstand near him and lighted it . Sometime , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Inhaling deeply , he closed his eyes hard against the bitter thought of another failure . Jesus ! Damnere a full year of being a goddamned , helpless cripple ! And it had to have been just as tough , maybe worse , on Orlean , working and worrying about him endlessly , one damn long day after the other . Hell , it would have been a whole lot better for her if he 'd just been killed , clean and outright , in the first place . The Copper Company would have given her a little money , at least , for him dying on the job . And a girl like Orlean could have already gotten married again , easy , instead of being saddled forever with a hopeless , bedridden half of a shell of a man like him . Goddamn his pantleg for twisting around him in the tunnel and stopping the bleeding . Why could n't his goddamn pants have minded their own goddamned business , , anyway ? 165  | It just was n't fair for her . Though it went against everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jumping out of the window , so that he 'd stop being such a problem . But he could n't have made it to the window , and he was now in a ward on the second floor anyway . " Hell , " he 'd told himself grimly . " You dumb sonofabitch , you 'd just wind up breakin ' your other goddamned leg , too . " So , damnit , there was n't a thing he could do about it . Especially while those doctors kept rebreaking his goddamned crooked leg , over and over again . He inhaled again , knowing even with his eyes shut that his hand was trembling slightly . Maybe this time , today . Maybe , finally , the leg would be right . But it sure as hell never had been , yet . Smoking and waiting with closed eyes , he thought back over the foreverness of time he 'd been here . Their second baby , a little girl that they 'd named Delores , had been born . And Wayne and Guila had gone off and got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clair thought about the idea , Clair had suggested that maybe his little brother was too young . But then Wayne had gently pointed out that he was now the same age as Clair had been when he married Orlean , so that had been that . Soon after , Darrell and Margaret had gone and taken the same step , and Margaret and Guila were as happy as kids at Christmas time fixing up the little places they 'd moved into . In those endless months , Clair 's father had once come to see him , heavy-jowled and uncomfortable . He 'd sat and folded his hands before him , and made a big point of clearing his throat . " ? Uhh , Enzy , y'r mother , sends ya her love . ? She 's just been so danged busy , ? lately . " " Sure , Dad , " Clair said quietly . " ? I understand . " The older man studied his chubby fingers that he 'd folded  | together in his lap before him as though to give each of them a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just may go in the furniture business , ? out t ' Magna , ? but I du n no yet , f'r sure . " " That sounds real nice , Dad . " " Well , ? I just wanted t ' stop by , ? an ' make sure you 're doin ' okay . " Clair could n't find it in him to mention that for a long time he 'd been in agony , and near death . He just said , " ? Thanks , Dad . " " Got ta go , now . Y'r brother Ken 's waitin ' down in the car . " The old man unfolded his fat fingers and stood up . " Ken says hers sorry he ai n't seen ya yet . But he 's been purty busy , too . An ' right now there 's , ? kind of a parkin ' problem downstairs . " " ? Sure , Dad . ? Thanks for stoppin ' by . " The old man had nodded vaguely , without quite looking in Clair 's direction , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if to offset that , a few days later Big Bertha Pearl had paid him a visit . She came in , her pearls swinging at her throat , and frowned down at him without sitting in a chair . In a voice that was almost a whisper for her , she said , " You dumb sonofabitch . Why do n't ya look where you 're goin ' ? " " Well , I did look . " " That 's no goddamned excuse at all ! " She touched his hand with her big fingers , all loaded with massive rings , and spoke with quiet sincerity . " Listen , kid , I 'm in a hurry with a long ways if go , and I got money . Tell me ,  --  what d ' ya need ? " " Nothin ' , thanks , Big Bertha . " " That 's all you ever need , is nothin ' ! " " Well , ? " " An ' here ya are , all whacked out , an ' down on your luck , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say ya do n't need nothin ' ! "  | " Hell , " he grinned , " do n't lose y'r temper at me . ? I ai n't well ! " She took a long , resigned breath . " I been keepin ' close track of ya , through Sherril an ' all . " " ? Wish ya was n't goin ' away ? " " Got m ' reasons . ? I likely wo n't see ya again . " " Well , ? thanks f'r gettin ' me that job , up t ' the mill . " " Sure . Look where it 's got ya . " She lowered her eyes , blinking as though something were caught in them , and turned quickly away , her pearls swinging on her neck . Then she turned quickly back and said , " ? I 'd ever had a kid , maybe kinda like you , ? I would n't a ' been too disappointed . " And then she was gone . Clair now lighted a second cigarette from the glowing butt of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Outside , the dim , gray afternoon light was fading . Anytime , now . He did n't know if he could stand the idea of them breaking his leg once more . The way they did it made it seem more like he was in a torture chamber than a hospital . Carefully arranging his leg just so . Raising that big , ugly , heavy iron-ball slowly up high above it . And then , suddenly letting it fall . Five times now they 'd done that , ? and five times the bone had started to grow back together more crooked and impossible to use than before . And each of those times it had seemed a crueler way to do it , and was harder for him to face all over again . " Hell , " Clair muttered to himself , shrugging slightly against his fear . " Guess there just ai n't no real polite way if bust a fella 's leg . " Then he tried to force himself to think of something else . A nurse turned on the lights in the ward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him softly before sitting near  | the bed . He could see at once that she was as nervous as he was , but was pretending not to be . " Well , " he grinned . " Fancy meetin ' you here . " " I just thought I 'd drop by , " she smiled . " ? Since there was n't anything better to do . " Then , as casually as possible , she added , " Guess there 's , ? no news yet ? " " No , not yet , " he said easily . " Doctor spent most a ' the morning ' takin ' off the cast , an ' takin ' X rays an ' all . " He grinned and shook his head . " Damn leg musta been photographed as much as Charlie Chaplin by now . ? But I ai n't at all sure whether it 's his pictures ' r mine that come out the funniest . " Her eyes dropped from his and he said quickly , " Hey , honey , I was just kiddin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I got a feelin ' that it really will , at last . " She now slowly raised her eyes to meet his , nodding and smiling faintly . And then Dr. Hughes came quickly to the side of the bed , holding some reports in his hand . In a strained , unusually low voice , he said , " ? It worked . " It was still a few more weeks before Clair could leave Saint Mark 's , weeks in which he spent every waking hour moving about more and more , at first with the help of crutches , gradually building up both his own normal strength and the strength of his leg , and relearning his lost sense of balance in walking . Toward the end of that time , Orlean became faintly vague and mysterious about everything except how well the children were doing . But Clair was usually so exhausted during her visits by his efforts to build his weakened body up , that he was hardly aware of her elusiveness . All he knew was that she was quitting her job , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part-time job for him , and that they were moving back to Magna . Then , finally , there was the sunny , clear spring day when Orlean and Sherril came to take him from the hospital . In the lobby , Dr. Hughes came over to them and handed Clair a small , shiny piece of curved , flat steel about the size of the bottom of a man 's foot . It looked like a large spoon on one end , joined to an even larger spoon on the other . " Going away present , " he said . " If your leg or foot starts to get tired , put this in your shoe . " " Sure is nice , ? but what is it ? " " Arch support . The arch in your right foot is almost nonexistent . " Trying to find some words to thank him for everything , Clair said , " Doctor  --  I , ? " But then his voice started to break , so he made his voice stronger and said , " Sure hate t ' wind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Mercury had funny feet , " Dr. Hughes said . " They had wings on them , and he was the fastest runner in Roman mythology . " Clair looked at the flatly curved piece of steel in his hand . " ? Thanks for the wing , Doctor . " The doctor kissed Orlean on the cheek , and walked quickly away . Then Sherril went to bring his car around , and Clair and Orlean got into it . On the road back to Magna , Clair frowned and said , " We did n't pay nothin ' on our way out of Saint Mark 's . How come ? " Sherril said , " ? Paid , beforehand . " " How the hell ? ? " Clair paused briefly . " We had t ' be short . " " We covered most of it , Clair , " Orlean explained . " Dr. i  | Hughes worked for practically nothing . And we only owed two hundred dollars more . " Clair frowned from one of them to the other . " Where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars ? " " Easy , " Sherril said . " I finally sold your Indian . " " My cycle ? " Clair asked . " Yeah . " " Much as I love them wheels , " Clair said , " they was n't worth half that . ? Who the hell did ya ever find who was dumb enough t ' buy it for two hundred ? " Sherril drove into the growing dusk of Magna and made a right-hand turn . Then he said , " ? Me . ? I bought it . " After a time Clair said , " ? You dumb sonofabitch . You really got gypped . " " Well , hell , nobody ever accused me a ' bein ' too smart . " Clair touched Sherril 's shoulder in the shadows . " You ai n't only not too smart , but you 're goin ' in the wrong direction t ' our place . " " Oh , no ! " Orlean said . " It 's the right direction , now . " Unable to hold back at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You 'll see ! " And just then Sherril pulled up into Louise Avenue , a tiny , curved street off the main dirt road , where there were seven or eight nicely built , slightly separated houses . He stopped at the third house , where there were lights inside and three cars in the small driveway . " This is some nice place , " Clair said . " It 's ours ! " Orlean said with another hug . " And it has two rooms ! ? Come and see ! " " Also , " Sherril added , " we 're havin ' a comin ' home party for ya . So try an ' behave . " Inside , the small front room was filled with people who overflowed into the second room behind it . Vivianne , Evelyn  | and Margaret were serving small sandwiches and soft drinks , while Guila was quickly rinsing and drying glasses . Miles had set up a small bar on the table in the front room , and was making hard drinks for those who wanted them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What 'd the doc say about booze ? ! " " He warned me only t ' drink with m ' right hand . " There were friends from up at the mine , and from town , gathering around and shaking hands , welcoming Clair back . Bull Barstow was there , and even old man Swenson put in an appearance , drinking a strawberry pop and making one of his rare jokes by telling Clair he should have stayed at his grocery store , where there was n't quite so much danger of locomotives . Over the next two or three hours , there must have been almost thirty people who came in and out , and then it started to quiet down . There was only family left , when Ken showed up with a skinny , thin-faced girl . " Jeez , brother , " Sherril said . " I 'll bet you 're late for your own funeral . " " One thing an ' another . ? Got held up . " " Better late than never , " Clair said . He held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ya , Ken . " Ken shook the offered hand briefly and limply before gesturing vaguely toward the girl . " This here 's Lauretta , from over if Big Sandy . " Orlean stepped toward the other girl , smiling . " I 'm Orlean , Lauretta . Can I take your coat ? " " No . We ai n't stayin ' long . " " Sherril , " Ken said . " C'n I talk to ya , outside ? " " Sure . " They went out , and Miles said from his table-bar , " How ' bout a drink , Lauretta ? "  | " I never touch it . " Miles grinned . " ? Lips that touch mine , huh ? " She did n't answer him , and a moment later Sherril and Ken came back in . " Well , we got ta go , " Ken mumbled to no one in particular . " Okay , Ken , " Clair said . " I 'm glad ya got a chance t ' stop by , at least . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and left , and there was a brief silence in the room . Miles shrugged philosophically at their abrupt exit , and made himself another drink . Clair said quietly , " I sure am glad he got a chance t ' come by . " Sherril handed his glass to Miles for a refill and said , " How many times he visit ya in the hospital ? " " ? I heard he was kinda , ? busy . " Sherril took his refill from Miles and downed a deep drink of it . " Doin ' what ? " " ? Never got mentioned . " Sherril took another drink from his glass . " Hell , I guess it do n't matter . But it sure beats me how a fella c'n have a brother like you , an ' Old Wayne here , an ' Marvin up in Canada , ? an ' then luck out with one like him . " " Sherril , " Wayne said in a low voice , " Ken did come t ' welcome Clair home . " " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard on the table . " He come t ' borrow ten bucks is what he come for . " " Maybe , " Vivianne said , " it was both . " " ? Maybe , " Sherril said , pouring himself another drink . " But he sure cut out fast with the tenner . " " Not many people , " Vivianne continued softly , " know or feel as much about , ? love , and loyalty , ? as you do . "  | " Everybody does . " Sherril raised his glass in a slightly wavering , drinking salute . " Everybody , ? here gathered , does . Sure as hell the people who live here , Clair an ' Orlean , sure goddamn well do . " He raised his glass a little higher . " He 'd a ' ruther been dead , than give her some kind of a rough time . ? And she 'd a ' ruther been dead , than have him have some kind of a rough time . ? An ' that 's the beautiful kinda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some of them drank with him , and when Sherril put his glass down , Clair lowered his own drink and said , " Orlean an ' me gratefully accept all that deadness , an ' the other nice things ya said . ? But now we 're all here alone , ? will somebody please tell me , finally , what a flat-broke , outta work guy like me is doin ' sittin ' here in a two-room house ? " Orlean 's eagerness suddenly won out over her normal shyness . " Can I answer ? ! " " Sure , " Clair said . " Sherril and some friends got you an even better job up on the hill ! " " Thirty dollars a week , " Sherril said . " Thirty dollars ? ! " Sherril nodded . " You got a supervisory job on Railroad Signal Maintenance . ? Guess they figure you 're the only livin ' , bona fide expert on the hazards a ' that there tunnel . " " And Clair ! " Orlean went on . " Everybody here helped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are furnished nice ! We 've got a stove , and a sink , and a couch ! Just about everything ! Even two kerosene lamps , one for each room ! " Clair lowered his head , and it was his sister Evelyn who said quietly to him , " ? The rest of us did n't do too much . ? Orlean almost killed herself doing it , and we just helped her , a little bit . "  | Clair looked back up , but just then did n't seem to be able to say anything , except with his warm eyes . " Well , hell , " Miles said gruffly , " we got a long haul home . " " Vivianne an ' me are only a mile away , " Sherril muttered , " but in my shape , that 's a longer haul than yours . " " Us too , " Darrell said quietly . " Got ta get a move on , or Margaret 'll fall asleep where she 's sittin ' there . " Wayne and Guila were the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said to Clair , " ? Ken meant good . " " You bet he did , " Clair said . " I 'm sure glad he came . " And then at last , Clair and Orlean were by themselves . They hugged each other , alone in the front room , and Clair said , " One last question , very pretty lady who is a princess of some very special kind . " Still hugging her , he leaned back and said , " What have you done with our two children ? Sold them into slavery ? " She frowned and looked with suspicious eyes from right to left . " I left them in the care of the Wicked Witch of Fifth Last , who is my evil sister Melva , who would rather have come to the party , but got stuck with the kids . " " Then this whole castle is ours , tonight ? " " The whole two rooms . " And then he hugged her so hard that she could n't breathe . ? But she did n't care at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could figure out just how Sherril and his friends had managed to get him this new job . He was a signal dispatcher , and not only was his office job easier and the pay better , but the hours were shorter . He rarely had to work more than a nine-hour day , which gave him more time with ( ) rlean and the children , and also more time to try to improve himself by studying at home . One night after supper , when Little Clair and Delores were already sleeping , he said to Orlean , " I 've decided the field of electricity 's not f'r me . " " Oh ? " " Guess I kinda got sucked in t ' that because they called me an electrician 's helper . But I do n't like electricity . ? It has a habit of spittin ' at ya . " " That 's not very nice of it . " " An ' I sure do n't want if work up there on the hill forever , like most fellas around here . No matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a boss over ya . ? An ' sooner or later , I want if be my own boss . " She studied him quietly . " Have you decided what to do ? " " Yep . I 'm goin ' t ' be the world 's number-one , highest-paid , absolutely best supersalesman . " " Good for you . ? Selling what ? " " I was afraid you 'd get around if that detail , " he grinned . " ' Cause I ai n't got no idea , yet . But it do n't really matter .  | They 've got these Spenser mail-order courses , with books and everything . What they do , they just teach ya  --  plain , basic salesmanship . An ' then with a good job like mine , ya can save a little money an ' start y'r own business sellin ' anything , from  --  from pencils t ' , ? ocean liners . " " I like the ocean liners best . " " Okay . But maybe we 'll start , ? with a rowboat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she shrugged , " as long as we get a sea voyage out of it . " Somewhat to Clair 's own surprise , the Spenser mail-order course was thorough and tough , and hard to pass . There was a difficult part on Basic English . They even had a section on penmanship , which they called , " The vitally important , written measure and mark of a salesman , " and another section on " Sales Psychology , " involving different ways of dealing with various clients , and under what circumstances to use a " hard " or a " soft " selling approach . Four months later , when he received his " Spenser Diploma of Salesmanship , " he was proud enough of it to stop by The Smokehouse after work and show it to Sherril . His brother was on the late shift , and he and Vivianne had stopped in here for a drink or two before he went on up the hill to work . They were at a corner table , and Clair went over to sit down with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What 'll ya have ? " " Whatever you 're drinkin ' suits me . " Sherril waved to the new owner , a small , sullen man whose swarthy face did n't seem to match up at all with his nickname , " Dutch . " Sherril ordered drinks for the three of them , and when Dutch had left , Vivianne said , " Place 's sure never been the same since Big Bertha Pearl left . " " Yeah , " Sherril agreed . " But at least it 's still some kind of a  | hangout . An ' in this old world , ya always got ta try t ' be a philosopher . " He looked at Clair . " Right , kid brother ? " Clair frowned thoughtfully and said , " I 'm not at all sure that you 're really equipped t ' talk t ' me on that kind of a high level . " " Oh ? " Sherril nodded faintly . " Pray tell , how the hell come ? " " Because I 'd overwhelm ya . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " This paper proves how smart I am . " " That sure does need some kinda proof . " Sherril took the diploma out and studied it . " ? Goddamn . I was n't never too sure whether you really could actually read ' r write . " Vivianne said eagerly , " Let me see , " and Sherril handed it to her . Then he grinned at Clair . " Soon as ya get rich , will ya do like it says in The Big Rock Candy Mountain ? ' " " What part ? " " Have a lake , a ' stew , an ' a whiskey too , ? for when I come t ' visit . " " I 'll have ' em installed directly . " " How ' bout if this comin ' weekend we all have dinner at our place if celebrate you not bein ' quite so dumb as ya look ? " " You bet . ? Can I buy us another ? " " Nope . " Sherril stood up . " Duty calls . Car 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sure . " Vivianne looked up from the diploma . " This is really great ! " Sherril leaned down and kissed her lightly on the cheek . " Insult the kid as much as ya can . ? Good f'r his ego . " She smiled and returned his light kiss . " Now stop being jealous of how smart he is . And hurry home . " Walking through the growing night up the long , steep path  | to the mill , Sherril found himself whistling a happy , tuneless melody . And he still was whistling a little later , as dark fell and he got to the Electrician 's Shop . His young assistant of four years , Joe Wolfson , was already there . " You 're pretty cheerful , " Joe said . " I feel good . " " That 's the trouble with you . Ya always feel good . I think you 're a nut . " " Anything doin ' ? " " Nah . " Joe was checking some meters , making notes . " Got a report that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chemical Storage , early on . But they did n't go out , an ' the juice seems okay over there now . " " That 's funny . " " What 's funny ? " " Lights dimmin ' in Chemical Storage . That buildin 's hooked up on the same circuit as the Ore Crusher . Forty thousand volts . ? Should be enough power there t ' light all a ' Salt Lake . " " Well , " Joe shrugged . " It 's okay now , anyway . " Sherril went carefully over the daily reports on his desk , and then started to examine Joe 's meter readings while Joe went out to make his field spot checks . Sometime later Joe was back . " Damnit , " he said , slightly irritated . " Them lights over in Chemical started actin ' up again . " " Yeah ? Well , let 's go take a look . " They crossed the dark hundred yards or so to the big Chemical Storage building where the lights inside flickered and dimmed , but never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there were relaxing , having smokes . " Rotten electricians we got around here , " one joked .  | " We 're here t ' rescue you dumb bastards , " Sherril said . " Ya ought a be grateful . " Inside the single , huge room , there were long , high rows of stacked boxes , wooden crates and metal containers . The electric panel and main switch were located on the far side of the building from the entrance , and they had to wind their way ( between the tall stacks of containers to finally get to it . They were a few steps from the large electric panel when the lights suddenly went out totally , plunging the building into complete darkness . Much worse , the sudden , hideous smell of furiously smoldering heat and melting rubber came ltiirshly to Sherril 's nostrils . Flicking on his flashlight and leaping toward the electric panel , Sherril yelled , " Get outta here Joe ! Throw the main switch up at the shop ! " He burned his hand badly , snatching open the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was a small , concent rated hell of flashing , sizzling electricity gone crazy . Still he t tied desperately to throw the switch here , but the incredible heat had already seared it in place . Then , at some point behind him , the swiftly growing electric heat touched off a container of volatile chemical that exploded like a bomb , showering fiercely burning flames over most of the large building . Sherril ran back , twisting and turning between the stacked chemicals and the quickly spreading , searing flames . Some men were already gathering outside the door as he burst out , his clothes smoking . Glancing at them , he yelled . " Where 's Joe ? ! " " Nobody but you come out ! " someone shouted . " He 's still in there ! " another voice called . A couple of men yelled , " No ! " and " You 're crazy ! " as Sherril spun around and ran back into the swiftly growing inferno.  | With the crackling roar of angry flames all around him , the heat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joe sprawled face down on the floor , the back of his jacket already starting to burn . Sherril picked him up and , struggling with Joe 's dead weight , started back for the door as fast as he could make it . Then , between them and the door , a solid wall of fire suddenly erupted into thundering existence , forcing Sherril into a backward , off-balance step or two . But there was no other way out . And the thought never even occurred to Sherril to drop his friend and sprint through the flames by himself . Instead , he took as much of a half-breath as he could , the oven-hot air scorching his lungs , and staggered through the roaring wall of fire with Joe in his arms . Just outside the door Sherril collapsed and other men , braving the intense heat even here , dragged the two men farther away , frantically beating the flames from their clothing and hair . " They 're still alive , " someone said . " Jesus ! " another man muttered , gasping for breath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It was five days later when the doctors finally let two people see Sherril , and then only one at a time . Vivianne came out in tears , unable to speak , and Clair was the second one to go in . Almost all of Sherril 's body was bandaged , including his entire face except for his lips and his eyes , which were clear and showed faint humor lurking in them . Looking up at Clair , he said , " Well , I spent enough time lookin ' down at you . Guess turnabout 's fair play . " " Did they tell ya , yet ? ? You saved Joe 's life . "  | " Yeah , I heard , " Sherril said quietly . " An ' I sure am glad . " " That , ? sure was somethin ' , " Clair said in an equally quiet voice . " ? Goin ' back in after ' im . " Sherril forced a tiny grin . " Hell , I did n't have no other choice . ? Joe owed me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head slightly . " That 's my brother , " he n i i i rinured . " Just as money-mad as ever . " " Is Vivianne , ? okay ? She did n't have much t ' say . " " Sure . She 's a brick . But she 's been goin ' half crazy , wvorryin ' about ya . " Sherril was silent for a moment . Then , again , he forced the tiny smile . " Chances are , ? I may 've lost a little bit of m ' beauty . " Clair touched him gently on his thickly gauze-encased arm . " I tell , not much t ' lose on that count , ? you bein ' s ' damn homely in the first place . " Again that tiny , irrepressible smile came to Sherril 's lips . " You always did see the bright side a ' things . " And then , suddenly , he was asleep . Miles and Evelyn took the still-unspeaking Vivianne to stay with them , and Clair drove Wayne and Guila back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dropping them off , he continued on through the night to his own home . Orlean had supper waiting for him , but he only wanted coffee . She brought it to him , then sat silently near him at the table . At last he said , " I saw him . ? He 's gon na be okay . " " Well , thank God , " she murmured . " But then , what 's wrong , Clair ? " Ile took a sip of coffee . " ? Vivianne . She ca n't even talk . " After a moment Orlean said , " She 's in shock , Clair . Nothing like this has ever happened in her life . " " No kiddin ' ? " Clair said in a hard voice , though his eyes  | looked at Orlean gently . " Then tell me . How many times ' ve you ever had y'r husband get run over by a goddamned train ? " " Well , " she hesitated . " I 'm glad to say , only once . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talked , and talked damn good , I 'd be walkin ' around here with a fourteen-inch limp . " Orlean said nothing , and Clair took another drink of coffee almost angrily . " Sure he 's gon na be scarred up a little , but right now he needs all the help he can get . An ' she ca n't even talk to ' im , or comfort ' im . She 's scared t ' death before they even take his goddamned bandages off . An ' ya know what that means ? " " ? No . " " It means the difference b'tween you an ' her . " He reached over and gripped her hand so hard that it hurt . " You always just worried about me . ? She 's worried about herself . " " I 'm not sure that 's fair to her , and ? " " I am . " His grip remained fiercely tight . " It 's all a matter of spirit . An ' that 's what you are , honey . A hundred an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by this , and correcting him softly , she said , " A hundred and fifteen pounds . ? And you 're hurting my hand . " " I 'm sorry . " He released it , then held it again gently . Very seriously , she said , " He 'll be all right . " " Thank you , more than ever just right now , at this minute , for being my girl . " " ? You 're welcome . " The way it turned out , Sherril was all right . But much of the small world he lived in was not . When he was released from the hospital he was the same gentle person , with the same warm sense of humor and kindness . But his face was  | scarred , and his body . And in a strange way , perhaps the worst thing of all was that he 'd lost all of his hair , and even his eyebrows and eyelashes would n't grow back . Vivianne soon left him , and in his grief some of the wits around The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took to spending more and more time at Clair and ( ) rlean 's home . One day , playing with the baby Delores , who was just learning to speak , he bounced her on his knee for a long , galloping pony ride . And then , as she was giggling wildly at the exciting ride , he said , " Hey , you ! We do have some pretty good old times t'gether , do n't we ? ! " Still laughing uncontrollably , she beamed up at him and said her first full sentence . " You beaut-ful , Uncle Sherrill " Very gently and very slowly he put her down , and then walked outside . That night , after supper , he sat with Clair on the edge of the small front porch and said , " ? Think I 'm gon na bust outta here f'r a while . " " What for ? " " Just f'r the hell of it . " ( ) rlean had finished the dishes now , and she came out to sit with them , drying her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darkness Clair said , " ? Sherril 's thinkin ' a ' takin ' off . " In the faint , starry light , she managed a half-smile toward them . " I hope it 's not because of my cooking . " " No . Your cookin 's great , except ya overdo the meat a little . " " f you 'll stay , " Orlean said , her voice very low and controlled , " I 'll just wave it over the stove a couple of times . " " No , " Sherril said . " I 'm goin ' . M ' house is about even , so I 'll just leave that t ' the bank . Car 's paid for , an ' I 'll use that t ' 111 188 One Time , I Saw Morning Come Home  | move on in . " He hesitated . " Just leaves the Indian , an ' that cycle 's yours anyway , Clair . " " No , it ai n't . It 's yours . " " You stubborn , pardon me Orlean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , t ' Wayne . " " Done . " Clair nodded in the dim starlight . " But where the hell ya gon na go ? " " Read someplace , ? that beauty 's in the beholder 's eye . You two sure as hell are beholders , just like that little girl a ' yours , Delores . " Sherril stood up from the edge of the porch , and his voice suddenly was n't quite as strong as he wanted it to be . " ? I 'm gon na go see if I can find me somebody , somewhere in this world , ? who wo n't see me quite as ugly as I am . " " Sherril ? " Orlean stood up and hugged him , and his rough , ' ' IIII scarred cheek moved softly against hers in a gentle embrace . " Take care a ' this dumb kid brother a ' mine , " he said . ti " I will . " Clair was now standing near them , and Sherril looked quietly at him before touching his shoulder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just consider me an explorer , lookin ' for a goddamned beholder . ? There 's got ta be one , someThen he walked quickly to his car and drove away . It was long , long after the sound of the car had gone that they turned silently in the dim starlight and went back into their home . About a month later , with early winter upon them , Margaret came into Orlean 's house . She came in the front door and patted Little Clair on the head , then tickled Delores on her way to the back room where Orlean was hurrying back and forth between the hot stove and the sink where there were several bottles and two bushels of tomatoes .  | " What ya doin ' ? " she asked . " Putting up tomatoes , I think ! " And then she added , " I hope ! Nothing 's working right ! " " Can I help ? " " Yes ! Peel some tomatoes ! It looks like it only works if they 're peeled ! " Quickly taking a paring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hey , d ' you know what a stock market crash is ? " Struggling with a heavy pot of steaming water , Orlean said , " No . " " Well , we had one . " " We did ? " " I guess . ? Back if New York City , in a place called Wall St reet . ? It 's like , somehow , everything 's gone crazy , an ' everybody 's broke . " Margaret handed her two fresh-peeled tomatoes . " Darrell told me , an ' then he went off t ' see some friends . ? It sounds like it could , maybe be kind a ' serious . " ( ) rlean wiped some sweat from her forehead and said , " Clair will know about it when he comes home . We 'll see . " Clair came home and said that as far as he knew those big business problems back East could n't hurt the rest of the country too much . Though it still did n't sound good to him . And then , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the now deep winter snow , and for a time he did n't v ant to talk . Finally he sat at the table , and she silently brought coffee for them both . " Orlean , " he said , " ? I got laid off , t'day . " " What for ? You 've been doing so good on your job . " " ? They laid off half the town . Seniority 's all that matters , : in ' they only could keep on the old-timers . ? I guess that 's fair . " She nodded quietly . " ? What do you think we should do ? "  | " I do n't know . ? I sure as hell do n't know . " Orlean smiled briefly and said , " You 're so darn smart . You said before we got married , that there 'd be tough times up ahead . " " Hell , I did n't have no idea they 'd be as tough as they 're turnin ' out ' t be . " He got up tiredly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she joined him there , putting her arms around him , he said , " ? Seems t ' me , I sure have let you down . " " You sure have , " she agreed . " Here we are , twenty years old , and our whole life behind us . " " Goddamnit , you 're makin ' fun a ' me . " " I am not . " She tried to make a fake , imitation sob . " But all that I can think of is how great everything was before , when we were young . And how terrible it is , now that we 're old . " " You are makin ' fun a ' me ! " " Is that so ? " She tickled him a little bit . " Yes , it is ! " He tickled her more , until they were both laughing . And finally , much later , after a warm , quiet silence , he at last said in a low voice , " ? Quite a lot 's happened , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she whispered . " Quite a lot . " " Are you sorry , ? or happy about them ? " " I would n't trade any one day of those years for a whole other lifetime . " She hugged him so fiercely that Clair almost lost his breath . And then , holding each other tightly and closely on the sofa , they became silently and warmly lost in their embrace .  | ONE SATURDAY night Clair got home from Salt Lake in the darkening evening before Orlean had heard the distant , familiar bell of the Bamburger trolley . She could see by his face that he had n't had any luck in finding a job , so she did n't ask . She just helped him off with his ice-speckled jacket and then gave him a hug . He kissed her and said , " Boy , is it cold out there . " " How did you beat the trolley home ? " " Easy . " But before explaining , Clair crossed to where Little ( lair was toying with the last few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ' candy , kid . But finish y'r supper first . " He handed his son a black jawbreaker and the boy grinned up at him ww ith wide-eyed gratitude . Then Clair went to the stove to warm his hands , rubbing them briskly together over it . " Damn , it 's cold . " " That 's why I put Delores to bed early , " Orlean said . " rven in the house , it 's warmer in bed . " She started to dish up some beans from the pot on the stove . " Well then , how did you beat the trolley ? " " Well , I got t ' thinkin ' . I 've been wastin ' twenty cents a day on the train , every time I go t ' town t ' look for a job . So I invented a new thing , called hitchhikin ' . " " In this weather ? " " Well , it sure is refreshin ' , " he shrugged . " An ' just now I got home even earlier . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there was now the dim , distant sound of the trolley bell . " See , " he smiled . " You 've now had the pleasure of about ten extra minutes more of m ' company . " Orlean now put Little Clair to bed , as he was happily sucking on his jawbreaker . And then , just before the boy went to sleep , she took it out so that he would n't choke on it , stored it by his bedside for the morning , and rejoined Clair in the front room . " ? Do you think that kind of candy is good for Little Clair ? " " Not those jawbreakers , " he said as he ate . " Somebody musta figured out some way t ' put a sugar taste in a round , solid rock . ? But kids go for ' em . An ' just the way he grinned at me made it worthwhile . " " I do n't like you standing out on the road in this kind of weather . " " ? I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But it seems t ' work , an ' it does save money . " " Your coat had ice on it . You could freeze to death . " " Oh , come on . It ai n't all that bad , an ' if I hitch in an ' outta Salt Lake , we 'll be savin ' over a dollar a week . An ' so that 's just plain that , pretty lady . " III She could see that there was no possible way to argue with him , so she waited a quiet moment and then said , " Melva and Margaret are coming by with Al and Darrell to visit for a while . " " Good . " He finished his beans and smiled at her with his eyes . " Then we can talk about somethin ' besides penny jawbreakers an ' hitchhikin ' . Both a ' which , if I judge right , you do n't approve of a whole damn lot . " " There are a few things I do approve of . " Her eyes smiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Margaret is pregnant . " " Great . "  | " That 's why they 're coming over . Sort of a celebration . " Orlean 's two sisters and their husbands came in shuddering with cold and taking off their coats that were lightly covered with newly falling snow . As Orlean and Clair hugged Margaret , congratulating her , Al snorted , " That dang weather ! It 's bad enough out there t ' freeze a witch 's broomstick ! " Orlean served them hot cocoa , except for Clair and Darrell , who elected for drinks out of Clair 's last bottle of home brew , and they sat around the small front room , their combined bodies making it warm , even away from the stove . Darrell had been laid off a couple of weeks after Clair , and now Al sipped his cocoa thoughtfully and said , " Well , I just joined you two fellas in the ranks a ' the unemployed . ? Axe fell t'day . " " Good hell , " Clair said . " You got better'n ten years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " but there 's others up there got twenty years an ' more , ? an ' they 're even lettin ' most a ' them go , too . " Melva said , " Al 's been hearin ' about a thing called the CIO , that he thinks might help us all outta this fix . " " Sure , " her husband nodded . " Them CIO organizers say this whole d'pression thing 's a big , phony deal t ' force the workin ' man right down on t ' his knees , ? so that finally he 'll be willin ' t ' go back t ' work f'r anything , even f'r starvation wages . They say that if enough of us stick t'gether , we c'n force the mill an ' the mine t ' open back up an ' hire us all back on at fair wages . " " Do n't see how they can open back up , " Clair said , " when there ai n't nobody around t ' buy their copper . ? An ' there ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else , till people start workin ' again so they c'n afford t ' start buyin ' things again . " le grinned wryly . " It sure as hell is one vicious damn circle . "  | " I 'm tellin ' ya ! " Al insisted . " It 's them big shots that 're trickin ' us . They 're b'hind this whole thing . " " Well , if that 's so , " Clair said , " they 're sure doin ' one fine job a ' foolin ' me . I was in half a dozen job lines in Salt Lake t'day , an ' there was ex-big shots standin ' b'side me in every line . A doctor , a couple lawyers . " " No ! " Al grumbled , " I mean them back-East business big shots ! Them Rock'fellers , an such ! It 's all their doin ' ! " Not wanting to argue with Al , and seeing that he was deeply upset about losing his job , Clair shrugged and said , " ? Maybe you 're right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Me , I got a whole other thing in mind , just t'day , " Darrell said . " I got this brother that 's got himself this of dump truck . But he 's laid up an ' ca n't drive ' er . So we 're goin ' in partners , me drivin ' his truck an ' doin ' the work , an ' we 'll split all we make fifty-fifty . " " Swell , " Al grunted . " All ya need if do now , is find somebody who wants if hire a dump truck , an ' can afford it . ? Ya gon na take your truck under y'r arm , from door if door , like them kids sellin ' Liberty magazine ? " The younger man was at a loss to answer Al , and Orlean said in a quiet voice , " Maybe , Darrell , you ought to drive over and talk to Miles . That 's in his line and he might have some ideas , or maybe even hire you himself , sometimes . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a real good idea . " For the first time now , Margaret spoke , her voice small and a little frightened . " ? We 're all of us down if a few dollars  --  or less . ? What if none a ' this works ? Al 's CIO , Darrell 's truck , Clair 's lookin ' for a job . What happens , when ya just plain run outta anything if eat , or if ya just plain run outta coal in bad weather like this ? " She looked from one of them to the other . " ? What happens then ? " There was a silence . And then Melva looked at her little  | sister and said , " Honey ? ? What happens if there 's an earthquake tomorrow , ? or if the Day of Judgment comes ? ? No matter what comes to pass in this life , why you just go on , and you do the best you can . " After a moment , Margaret nodded silently . Melva smiled at her and said gently , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' more often than not , that tends t ' make a girl sort of on edge . " But still Margaret could n't quite let go of her question . " Maybe aybe I am edgy , an ' what you said was real good , Melva . But I ai n't talkin ' about earthquakes ' r Judgment Day . I 'm tall:in ' about , ? when everything you 've got , or ya need , just plain an ' simple runs out . " She glanced at Orlean , including her in the question . " How do ya feed your kids , if there ai n't nothin ' t ' eat ? " " We 'll always help each other , " Orlean said . " And one of us is always bound to have something . " " Sure , " Melva agreed . " An ' if worse comes t ' worst , there 's always the relief , too . Maybe the gover'ment might help a I i t t i e . An ' the church 's got relief , too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kinda , ? like beggin ' f'r help , ai n't it ? " " No ! " Al said . " Be it Uncle Sam or the Mormons , they both been paid for it up front , either with taxes ' r with church tithin 's . T ' go on honest relief sure ai n't takin ' no kinda handout . " " Iley ! " Clair said . " This here kinda talk is gettin ' us all down . " He grinned and shook his head . " Hell , we 're sittin ' around plannin ' a big , fancy funeral b'fore anybody even died ! Personally , I got a strong hunch that there ' r all kinds a ' good times just up ahead of us ! An ' furthermore , " he raised his glass in a small salute , " there 's even one a ' them damn good times right here , an ' right now ! "  | Darrell returned the raised-glass salute . " By golly , I 'll drink with ya t ' that ! " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " As long as you 're all drinking to something , " Orlean said , " it seems to me you could at least include Margaret 's coming baby . " " Darn right ! " Darrell agreed . " Here 's t ' the baby bein ' triplets ! " " Triplets ? ! " Margaret laughed a little now , through a puzzled frown . " Why ? ! " Very pleased with the joke he had in mind , Darrell forced back his own growing smile . " ? Think a ' all the work that 'd save me , havin ' t ' make them next two kids with ya . " It took Margaret a brief moment to understand . Then she slapped Darrell on the shoulder and as he leaned away from her , laughing , she said , " Oh , ? you ! " And when the four of them left a little later , they were all still in a happy mood , their laughter growing dimmer as they walked away on the cold night street . Now alone with Clair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hug , stretching up to kiss him lightly on the cheek . " You sure did good , dear husband . " " Hmm ? " " You know what I mean . You turned tonight from a sad , scared time to a good , happy time . " " Yeah , ? maybe so . " He ran his fingers gently through her hair , his eyes looking vaguely , thoughtfully somewhere off over her shoulder . " ? You really did , " she said in a low voice . " Thing is , ? I do n't know how much of what I said I believe . " She hesitated . " You-were just trying to make Margaret feel better ? "  | He nodded . " And Al , and everybody , maybe even includin ' you an ' me , honey . " " Well , you sure did do a good job . " She hugged him once more , softly . " ? Tell me what else there is . " " Couple a ' things . One is this . " His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard . " Whatever happens , I ai n't just about t ' accept ' r t ' take no kind of relief from nobody , under no circumstances . ? It just , ai n't a part a ' my nature . " " I know , " she said . " I understand . " " Second . If times do turn real hard , I ai n't about t ' let you an ' the kids go without . " Reading the strength in his troubled , far-seeing eyes , Orlean felt a moment of great fear . Taking his hand , she sat slowly down on the sofa , her own hand gently coaxing him to sit down beside her . " What are you talking about , Clair ? " His eyes finally met hers and he said firmly , " Real simple . ? If I ca n't get honest work , ? then there 's lots of  --  other things . " She squeezed his hand and managed to come up with a very faint smile . " ? My husband , the bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was deadly serious . " This depression ai n't even hardly begun yet . An ' however in hell I have t ' go about ( loin ' it , I 'm gon na damn well see you an ' our kids through it. , , " That kind of talk , ? scares me , Clair . " Now it was he who gripped her small hand firmly , reassuringly . " Do n't be scared . If things get s ' rough that I have t ' go in t ' bein ' a crook , I 'll only go up against big , rich outfits that wo n't really feel the dent . You know darn well I 'd never take one penny from a regular person , or even ever dream a ' hurtin ' anybody . " " But , ? if you ever did try that kind of risky thing , ? you could be hurt . "  | He grinned at her , but there was grimness rather than humor within him . " ? Tell me , then , about locomotives comin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about chemical fires . " After a moment of silence , she said quietly , " Clair , I love you in all ways . ? But this is a way I never saw before . " Trying to make it easier for her , he said lightly , " Still scared half t ' death a ' the new me ? " " ? Well , ? of what the new you could do . " He took a long , deep breath and exhaled slowly . " All it boils down to , honey , is that we 're down t ' four dollars an ' twenty-eight cents . An ' I 'm gon na make damn sure that you an ' them two kids get through these times okay , come hell , ? ' r come high water . " She moved down from the sofa , kneeling before him and resting her arms and her head lightly on his knees . " ? I know you mean that . " " You bet your boots I do , honey . " " Then , ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He rubbed her hair again , gently . " While y'r at it , tell ' im t ' hurry up , an ' with all this rotten weather we got , ask ' im for a job in sunny California . " Two days later , hitching another ride , Clair arrived home from Salt Lake in the late afternoon , his face shining from far more than the bitter cold , and with three gaily wrapped packages under his arm . Knowing that good things must have happened , even before Clair spoke , Orlean left the children playing at the table and moved toward him . " You 're just in time to help us draw some more kittens , with crayons . " " Are they good ? " He kicked the door shut behind him . " Considering that most of them are purple and green . ? I 'm not too sure about Little Clair 's sense of color . "  | Putting his packages down , Clair struggled out of his coat . " Anybody can draw a normal kitten . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a real special artist . Right , kid ? " Little Clair nodded in agreement and called out , " Right , Daddy ! ? But Delores keeps makin ' the ears too big . Her kittens all look like rabbits ! " Still drawing , Delores looked up with an angry frown . " They do not ! " Their small disagreement was forgotten now , as Clair brought over the two presents he had for them . " Here , kid . ? An ' this one 's for you , pretty little girl . " Little Clair 's quickly unwrapped gift was a wooden , handcarved pony , a black-and-white pinto that could just barely stand up when the boy placed it carefully on the table . " Do n't move , " he whispered to no one in particular , " or it c'n fall , an ' git itself hurt . " Delores now tore through the wrapping paper covering her present , and opened the box . " A dolly ! " she cried out . Pulling it from the box , she cradled it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a roughly prone position , its eyes suddenly went closed . Delighted , Delores almost screamed , " It sweeps ! " Orlean gently rearranged the doll more naturally in her daughter 's arms . " It sleeps , ' " she said quietly . Delores held the doll very closely to her . " That 's why I wuv it , Mommy , " she explained . " Because it sweeps ! " When the two children were finally in bed , Clair handed Orlean the last of the three gift packages . " ? Hope ya like it . " She started to unwrap it and then he put his hand out , covering both of her hands , and stopping her . " Listen , " he said quietly , " maybe I ought a tell ya somethin ' , first . " Looking up at him nearly in tears , she tried as much as she  | could to make her voice sound very tough . " Okay , Legs . Which bank job ya runnin ' away from this time ? " " Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ceiling , and then looked back down at her . " I 'm happy t ' report t ' you that I 'm still not up there on the Ten Most Wanted list . What you got , there , is just a natural present . " It was a white wool robe , covered with red flowers . She stood up and held it close against her , feeling its warmth . And then she saw the paper below , in the bottom of the box . " There 's more ? That ? " " You bet . " She took it out and just glancing through it she somehow knew instantly that it was a life insurance paper on Clair , and somebody had typed in that he was worth two thousand dollars . " I do n't know how you got this , " she said . " But I do n't want it . ? It 's insurance against your life . " " No , it ai n't , " he said . " It 's insurance that makes sure you an ' the kids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't like it . " She let the paper fall back onto the table . " What it says is , that sometime , you 'll be dead . " " Goddamnit , honey , " he said , " I thought that it was a fair present . ? All it means is just that you an ' the kids got some kinda security , ? with or without me . " " We do n't ever want any piece of paper . We want you . " " Okay . " Clair picked up the paper she 'd dropped . He slowly folded it into three very careful folds , putting it back into an envelope as he spoke . " This was part of my goddamn deal , damn it . ? Plus twenty bucks in advance . Your prayers come out half-way , Orlean . I got me a job . Not out in sunny California , but in frozen Omaha , Nebraska . " " How did you get a job ? " " That Spenser Diploma ' really came in handy t'day . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like I graduated from Oxford , over there t ' England , ' r somethin ' . " " It did ? " Orlean poured Clair the last of the home brew , and moved to the stove to make herself a cup of coffee . " Then , are we selling pencils , or rowboats , or ocean liners ? " " Turns out there 's no big market for boats a ' any kinda size in Nebraska just now , " Clair said . " An ' the consensus is there ai n't enough people there yet who can read ' r write if make it a real , red-hot pencil market for us . " Then what ? " " People seem if still have if sit down , ' r lay down , ' r have some kind of a place if talk around . ? That 's chairs , an ' beds , an ' tables . " He shrugged . " That 's why my deal could let me afford them three presents for us , on a twenty-dollar advance . ? I 'll be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? is something everybody needs . " " You bet they do , honey ! Everybody 's got if have some stuff if live with . " She grinned at him faintly . " The more you think about it , the truer it gets . " He touched her shoulder , then held it gently . " The rest a'the deal I made is , they loan me a car that runs , an ' twencydollars-a-week commission , against what I c'n sell . An ' we got ta be in Omaha by next Monday . " She looked at him for a long moment . " Clair , " she finally said , " I 'm really so very , very proud of you . " He looked down , and then moved his hands in a short , almost apologetic gesture . " ? I just went out an ' got me a job , ? is all . " She went to him and held his face gently in her two hands , looking softly up at him . " What you did , Clair , getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Well . " He raised his eyes at last to look warmly down at  | her . " We 'll go an ' see how long the world works , and how good it turns out t ' be , back there in Omaha . " " It 'll be good , " she said , putting her head against his chest . " And the world will last , forever . " Hugging her to him , he said , " How c'n a little girl like you claim that the world 'll last forever ? " " ? Because , it already has . " Suddenly exhausted , she looked at him and said , " Can we go to sleep ? " He said quietly , " You bet we can . "  | CLAIR AND Orlean divided their furniture and household things between Melva , Margaret and ' Wayne , for safekeeping . And two days later , on a drizzling , bitter-cold morning , they were ready to go . The car that Clair brought home that morning , on loan from " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nebraska , " was a I924 Ford sedan that had seen better days and had a roof that leaked . " It ai n't exactly a fancy Packard , ' r a Cadillac , " Clair said . " But it do n't leak too bad , and she 'll get us where we 're goin ' . " " ? Our first car ! " Orlean said , touching the shiny radiator cap almost reverently . " Well , not yet , exactly . But if the job works out , it will be our first car , in a year ' r so . " He grinned at her . " I was thinkin ' that , maybe , right at the last minute , you 'd be kinda nervous about makin ' this trip . ? But you 're as excited as the kids are . " " You bet I am ! ? Maybe you can teach me to drive , so I can spell you off sometimes ? ! " " We 'll see . ? But generally , honey , it 's just in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ B'sides , I honestly happen t ' really love drivin ' . " They put Little Clair on top of their clothing  --  piled high in the back seat , where he would have a good view of the 207  | passing world , and with Orlean holding Delores in her lap Clair started the car and they were on their way . Beyond Salt Lake , Orlean finally said , " We 're already farther away from Magna than I 've ever been ! " Then she added , " ? Are n't we going north ? " " Uh-huh . " " But , I thought Omaha was sort of somewhere back east . " " It is . But this car 'd have t ' be part mountain goat t ' make it over the mountains out that way . We got ta go up north an ' then cut back east through the bottom part a ' Wyomin ' . An ' then head kinda southeast on down an ' over t'ward Omaha . " " ? Oh . " After a thoughtful , frowning moment she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the driving , Clair . " The trip took four days . They had three flats , two of them on the same rear tire . But Clair knew how to patch them and fill them up again with the hand pump , so they were n't too much of a bother . And twice the car started steaming up front , but in both cases it only needed some more water added to the radiator to make it stop . Two of the nights they just pulled off the road and slept as best they could in blankets in the car . And the other two nights they splurged , paying the fifty cents it cost to rent one of the small , single-room cabins in the trailer courts that lined the road here and there along the way . When they were finally driving across the endless flats of Nebraska on the last day of the trip , Orlean said quietly , " Clair , ? there 's something funny . " He glanced at her . " You okay ? " " Yes . I feel fine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dizzy , or offbalance , somehow . "  | After a moment , he nodded . " Yeah . I kinda feel that same way , too . ? Maybe it 's a touch a ' that thing they call carsickness . " Two or three minutes later she said in sudden astonishment , " Clair ! I know what it is ! " Slightly startled , he said , " What ? ! " " No mountains ! There are n't any mountains anywhere ! " " Well , I 'll be damned , " he muttered . " That 's it ! Ya c'n look off forever , an ' still not see nothin ' ! ' ? An ' all this here big emptiness just kinda snuck up on us . " " Well , at least now that we know what it is , we can start trying to get used to it . " " I guess we better , " he grinned . " It 'd sure as hell be too damn much effort t ' go all the way back an ' haul us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They got to Omaha late that evening , and though it was too dark to see very much , the city managed to give the feeling of being gigantic . Clair had been given the address of a rooming house , and he at last found the two-story building on the corner of a shadowy , quiet block . Carrying the two sleeping children , they went to the front door . Mrs. Sheen , a soft-spoken , elderly woman , showed them a large , clean , furnished room on the first floor . " I 've roomed to many Hatfield Furniture folks , " she smiled . " They 've always been very fine tenants . " " This is real nice , " Orlean said . Clair nodded and asked , " How much is the rent , ma'am ? " " Seventy-five cents by the day . Four dollars by the week . By the week you save a dollar twenty-five . " " ? We 'll take it by the week . " " Good . I 'm glad . " Mrs. Sheen stepped toward Orlean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're all four of you  | exhausted , " she said . " So let 's see about getting you all settled in comfortably . " They stayed with Mrs. Sheen for nearly six months , and in that time Clair did better and better at Hatfield . His sales territory gradually expanded to include furniture stores in both Lincoln and Beatrice , and often he was gone on the road for as long as two or three days at a time . His weekly commissions were never less than twenty dollars , and sometimes ran as high as thirty dollars , or even more . Mr. Hatfield himself called Clair his " crack salesman , " and was so pleased that he at last arranged to get rid of Clair 's old Ford and replace it with a shiny and much newer 1929 Oldsmobile . To celebrate the new car , they drove the children and Mrs. Sheen to Omaha Park on Sunday and had a picnic near the bank of the river . It was a perfect day , except that Little Clair got lost and wandered off in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attendant found him and brought him tearfully back , weeping more out of pained embarrassment than fear . Their Sunday outings in the car became an almost weekly occasion . And unless Clair was away on the road , they went to one or another park , or to a museum , or simply for a happy , carefree drive out into the country . Then , near the end of those six months , Clair came home to their room from a sales trip to Lincoln late one night and found Orlean strumming very quietly on her guitar . She put a finger on her lips to ask for silence , so he shut the door slowly behind him . She crossed the room softly and kissed him . " I was just singing some songs to the children , " she whispered . " That always puts them right off to sleep. ? But it does n't say much for my musical talent . "  | Whispering back , he said , " Think ya got enough talent left over t ' make some coffee , without wakin " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she smiled , " is my really big talent . " As they drank their coffee , she said in a low voice , " ? Mrs. Sheen says she wants us to move . " " What ? ! " he whispered loudly . She smiled again , making him know that it was n't a bad thing . " And maybe she 's right . You 're doing real well , and ? she thinks we should have a bigger place , with more room , so that we wo n't have to whisper like this everytime the children are asleep . " " ? Oh . But , would n't Mrs. Sheen kinda miss you an ' the kids ? " " We 'd only be a few minutes away , " Orlean said with growing eagerness . " She showed me a big apartment house where for only two dollars a week more we can get three nice rooms , and there 's even a little balcony ! " " All that f'r only six dollars ? " " Yes . But , ? there is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " They 're not furnished rooms . And getting all the things we 'd need would be a big expense . Do , ? you think we could afford to take on something like that ? " " Hell , " he grinned , " furniture 's right down my alley . Sure we can ! " " Good ! " She gripped his hand in a quick , happy squeeze . " And we 'll even be on the third floor ! ? How 's that for moving up in the world ? ! " " How ' bout that ? First time we 'll ever ' ve really gotten off the ground . " They moved into the five-story Belvedere Apartments with only essential furnishings , and then began gradually adding to them , usually buying on time and finally even getting what was advertised as " The Epitome of Elegance , " a big Zenith console radio .  | But it was during their first few days at the Belvedere that Orlean learned one terrifying disadvantage to living in a thirdfloor apartment . Little Clair came into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mom . ? D'lores . " He said it so very quietly that Orlean felt an instant , grim foreboding even before she 'd stepped quickly into the living room . Out on the balcony , the baby Delores had somehow managed to climb up onto the top of the three-inch-wide balcony railing , and she was standing there on it now , balanced precariously three floors above the cement driveway below . Turning slightly , she saw her mother and called out happily , " Wook at me ! " Fighting down both her sheer terror and the almost overpowering impulse to rush out swiftly and grab her skittish , capricious little girl , Orlean forced herself to speak casually . " Hi there , are you having fun ? " " Oh , yes ! " " That 's nice . " Knowing that any quick or unexpected movement on her part could cause her daughter to retreat in quick panic , to lose her balance and go over the edge , Orlean smiled quietly and stepped slowly toward her , picking up a doll from a chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your dolly to play with out there ? " " Sure , Mommy ! " " All right , honey . ? I 'll bring it out to you . " Still smiling , Orlean crossed the balcony in an unhurried way , holding the doll out toward Delores . And then , at the very last moment , she suddenly grabbed the little girl in her arms with such swift strength that Delores gave a small shriek of startled , breathless shock . Her heart now beginning to pound thunderously within her , Orlean carried her daughter back into the living room on unsteady legs that almost gave way beneath her . Regaining her breath , Delores said , " Mommy ! You hurt ! "  | Finally , Orlean managed to say quietly , " ? I 'm  --  sorry , honey . " That night , after they 'd eaten supper and put the children to bed , Orlean was still shaken and frightened . " Good Lord , Clair ! It  --  it 's just impossible for her to have climbed up on that railin- She ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hey , darlin ' . She 's okay , an ' that 's what finally matters . " He touched her cheek soothingly , then grinned , trying to calm her . " She always has seemed t ' be part monkey . ? Probably from my side a ' the family . " " Oh , Clair , it 's just , ? " She took a long breath . " If it had n't been for Little Clair coming and telling me , ? " " Listen , I 've got a pint in the kitchen . Ya think maybe a stiff drink 'd help ya relax ? " " No . " " Then , ? I think , maybe , I 'll just have m'self one , anyhow . " She managed a very faint shadow of a grin . " You sure are a big phony . ? The whole thing scared you almost as much as me . " Then she said , " I 'll just lock up that door to the balcony , and then I 'll nail it shut too , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drink and adding some water to it , he said softly , " Now c'm on , little girl , that 'd be kinda silly . That 's a darn nice balcony , an ' also with that door shut , an ' no air movin ' , it gets hotter'n a pistol in here . " " I ca n't help it , Clair . Since I saw her standing there , the very idea of that balcony scares me to death . " He sipped his drink and they sat down at the kitchen table . " First thing in the mornin ' , I 'll go an ' get some stuff over t ' the hardware store . An ' I 'll build us a gate across that door with a lock that only you an ' me can open . That way , the kids 'll only be able t ' play out there when one of us is with ' em . " He grinned at her . " Honey , I 'll build that gate s ' high an ' s ' strong that neither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can climb it ' r bust through it . "  | Finally she nodded slightly . " ? Maybe . " " Damn right . " He became quietly serious . " Ca n't go through our lives nailin ' off nice balconies , ' r nailin ' off any other good things , just outta worryin ' about what might happen . Ya always take sensible care , but ya still enjoy them good things . ? Hell , that 'd be like turnin ' in our Olds , an ' givin ' up all them fine times we have in it , just b'cause there 's a chance a ' runnin ' into a telephone pole ' r somethin ' . " At last she looked at him and said , " Of course the gate 's the best idea , Clair . ? I guess , for a while there , I was just still too plain scared about Delores to think straight . " He studied her with quiet , thoughtful eyes . " ? You tell me about you bein ' scared an ' not thinkin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how ya got all the way from the kitchen door if the balcony railin ' without spookin ' Delores . Anybody makes a fast move t'ward that kid , an ' she 's off in the other direction like a scalded cat . " " I sort of  --  fooled her a little bit , with her doll . " She smiled faintly . " ? The one that ? sweeps . ' " He nodded . " Thought it was kinda like that . " Then he took a long drink from his glass . " ? Boy , Orlean , when somethin ' really counts , you sure ai n't never too far away . " Winter came and brought a rich , warm Christmas with it . Clair gave Orlean a delicate , silver Waltham watch , and she gave him a handsome silver cigarette case , both of the gifts flowerly engraved with each other 's first name . Delores was ecstatic over her new doll that not only opened and closed its eyes but actually cried a small baby 's cry when it was put down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expensive " Lindbergh Flying Uniform " that included warm gloves and a leather jacket , topped off by a leather flying cap complete  | not only with ear straps that buckled under his chin , but also with big , impressive goggles that he could pull down over his eyes . It was a good time , and so were the seasons that then followed , coming and going so quickly that it was hard to keep track of them . But in the middle of autumn Delores , who was now three , almost gave Orlean another heart failure . Her son and daughter had been out playing with some other children in the field behind the Belvedere , when Little Clair , now six , came into the apartment where Orlean was sewing and said casually , " Mom ? Can ya freeze t ' death in an old icebox that somebody 's thrown away ? " " No . " " Well , it 's okay , then . I guess I 'll go play some more . " He turned to go back out of the apartment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from her work . " What 's okay ? " " Delores wo n't freeze . " He turned again to go . " Clair ! " She put her work quickly aside . " Just what are you talking about ? ! " " Nothin ' , Mom , " he shrugged . " Delores just got in t ' an old icebox an ' pulled the door shut b'hind her . " " What ? ! " She was on her feet in an instant . " Where ? ! " Startled by her tone of voice , he said , " In the field ! " " Show me where ! Run ! " Now genuinely frightened , the boy dashed away down the hall and then down the stairs , Orlean running swiftly after him . Outside , they sped past some playing children and on across the wide field behind the apartment house , finally coming to a deep gully where there was an abandoned icebox leaning partially on its side against the far bank . Orlean raced down the steep slope before her and ran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | Crouched inside , her face beginning to turn faintly bluish , Delores said with great disappointment , " You found me ! " " Come out of there ! " Panting , Orlean helped the little girl down out of the box and to the ground . " What in the world were you doing ? ! " " Just hide-'n ' - seek , Mommy . " Kneeling before her , Orlean rubbed the little girl 's wrists briskly , and then her face , bringing color back into it . " Do you feel all right ? " Delores nodded , then made a face . " But the air inside that of thing was sure startin ' t ' taste awful . " That night , after he 'd learned what happened , Clair silently took a hammer and a flashlight and went out to the gully where he broke the door off the icebox . " Thank God you did that , " Orlean told him when he came back . Finally speaking , he said , " One thing I 'd a whole lot rather break @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' the guy who put it there . " A day or two later , he and a couple of his friends from the apartment house hauled the icebox away to the nearest junkyard . Then winter was on them again , filled with drives to the country and fierce , laughing , snowball fights , and a huge , community-built snowman in the front yard of the Belvedere Apartments . And then , finally , an early spring started taking away the snow and ice with its warm weapons of sunshine and light rains . On a Monday afternoon , Orlean had taken her two children to a Tom Mix movie . Little Clair had been particularly  | impressed by a sequence where a ten-year-old boy , grieved by the death of his horse , had lain down on the tracks in front of an onrushing train . Tom Mix had just got there in the nick of time to snatch his young friend from the murderous , oncoming wheels . She wondered if , perhaps , her young son still had memories remaining from his even younger life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he 'd been almost deliriously overjoyed , even leaping to his feet , when at the last split second , the train had n't hurt anyone . She 'd left the two children to play with some of their friends down in front of the Belvedere Apartments and was just starting to peel some potatoes , getting ready to make supper , when Delores and her brother came into the kitchen , both of them looking slightly troubled . " Why are n't you two playing ? " she asked . " Clair made me stop playin ' , " Delores muttered , frowning . " Why ? " " Well , " Little Clair said , " ' Cause it seems t ' me , we maybe got , ? kind of a problem . " " What problem ? " " Well , a big piece a ' somethin ' burnin ' come up outta the chimney . " " Yes ? " " An ' , it came down an ' landed on the roof . " " Still burning ? ! " " Yeah , Mom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by bringing her possibly bad news . " The roof 's on fire . " " Are you sure ? ! " " Pretty sure . It was startin ' t ' go like nobody 's business . " Orlean picked Delores up and grabbed her son by his hand as she rushed to the hall and down the stairs . Bursting out of  | the front door , she ran into the yard to where she could look up at the fifth-floor roof . A large section of the roof was in flames , and she could already begin to hear from high above the hissing and crackling of the growing fire . Nov other people began pouring out of the apartment house , and there were the frantic , screaming sounds of swiftly approaching fire engines . Everything started happening too fast to really know about , and yet in Orlean 's mind it seemed that everything and everyone was moving in a terrifying , slowed-up dream . The fire grew with a roaring , screeching life all of its own , suddenly leaping like a giant , flaming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the fifth floor , and then the fourth floor . Fire engines and crowding people were suddenly all around them . And now , the third floor would be the next to go . Orlean knelt beside her children and said , " Stay here . I 'll be back . " And then she ran toward the blazing apartment house . Two big firemen tried to stop her , but she shouted something they could n't hear , wrested free from them and plunged on into the burning building . Little Clair and Delores saw this , and with tears streaming down his face the boy picked up the garden hose and turned it on full blast to help put out the flames . But the firemen 's engines and their big hoses had taken up the entire water pressure , and all that the nozzle in the boy 's trembling hands could do toward fighting the raging blaze was to put out a few , helpless drops of water that fell hopelessly at his feet , along with his tears . The flaming spider of fire now dropped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engulfing it within seconds . And it was then that Orlean rushed back out of the front  | door and ran to her two weeping children . " It 's all right , " she said , hugging them breathlessly . " I did n't mean to scare you , but it 's all right . " It was after midnight two days later when Clair , totally exhausted from a trip to both Lincoln and Beatrice , parked his Olds in the dark , a half block away from the Belvedere . Hardly able to stay awake , and mostly staring down at the familiar sidewalk , he turned into the front yard of the Belvedere Apartments and walked almost completely to the front door before he looked up and suddenly realized it was n't there . All that was before him was a concrete foundation filled with a mass of charred wood . At first he could n't believe it , thinking that somehow he 'd made a terrible mistake , arriving in the wrong town , or on the wrong block or the wrong street . But then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he knew overwhelmingly that this charred wreckage had been his home . Holding his stunned horror and fear within him as much as possible , he went back to his car and did the only thing he could think of to do . He drove the few blocks to Mrs. Sheen 's . She opened the door in a bathrobe and seeing his face said quickly , " They 're all right , Clair ! " Then , a few minutes later , he was alone with Orlean in their same old room , and she was bringing him coffee , being careful not to wake the two sleeping children . " Was  --  anybody hurt ? " he asked quietly , lifting his cup with a slightly trembling hand . " No . Everybody lost just about everything , but they all got out in time . " He inhaled deeply , and then let his breath out slowly , in a long sigh . " ? Sure did scare me , quite a little bit . "  | " The paper said it was one of the fastest spreading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to let you know about it . We left a message with Mr. Hatfield , and even tried a telephone call once , to Beatrice . But you 'd already left the store there , and no one knew where you were going next . " He sighed again , still trying to get his emotional balance back . " ? Well , we just got all the apartment stuff finally paid off , an ' now here we are , right back where we started . ? But with you all windin ' up okay , nothin ' else matters a damn . " She smiled . " ? Broke again . " He grinned back at her . " Broke again , flat . ? But hell , I got the job , an ' the Olds 's almost paid for , an ' we 'll sure as shootin ' make ' er all over again . " She touched her cup against his in a small , almost soundless salute . " You bet we will . " They sipped coffee to her words , and then Clair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard ya went runnin ' back in t ' that big bonfire . " His low voice now came out with quiet , rumbling anger . " ? What the hell did ya go an ' do that for ? " " Are you mad ? " " ? It 's just that I still kinda remember Sherril doin ' somethin ' like that . ? Why the hell did you do it , too ? " Orlean 's eyes fell to the top of the table . " I , ? had to go back in , ? for just one thing . " " Jesus , honey , " he murmured quietly . " What ? " She got up and went to the bureau , where she pulled the top drawer out gently . Taking something out , she closed the drawer silently and sat back down at the table , handing Clair a folded piece of paper . After studying it a moment , Clair frowned up at her and said , " Goddamnit , honey . All this is , is just our goddamned weddin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is. "  | Both angry and puzzled , he tried to keep his voice down . " ? An ' you risked your life f'r this ? ! " " Well , " she said , " I just could n't stand the idea of it being burned . " Very slowly , he refolded the paper and handed it back to Orlean . " ? I am much too tired right now if even begin if tell ya what a dumb nut ya are . " " But do you like me ? " He leaned over and kissed her and said , " ? A little bit . " Three weeks later , on one of those sunny-cool spring days when nothing can be wrong , Clair came home in the early afternoon with something slightly glazed and wrong in his expression . Orlean was sitting on the floor , playing a new game called " Gas Station " with the children . She had a tiny toy car on the large , cardboard station , and was about to order five gallons of gas from Delores , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll take five gallons and drive to Kansas City , " she said , getting up . " You two go ahead , and do n't bother your dad and me . " She went into the kitchen with Clair , and he closed the door behind them before saying in a low , tight voice , " I been fired . " " ? Why ? " He poured himself a drink and said , " Nothin ' t ' do with Mr. Hatfield , or with me f'r that matter . Company just up an ' went bust , is all . " " You mean , whole big companies can go broke , just out of the clear blue , ? like people can ? " " Looks like . ? An ' if a fella was smart enough , maybe he coulda seen it comin ' . " He took a small drink and tried to grin 222 One Time , I Saw Morning Come Home at her , though he could n't manage to bring humor up into his eyes . " Anyhow , Hatfield an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but their shirts in just these last few days ' r so . " He paused , frowning down absently at the drink in his hand . " ? Nobody seems t ' know exactly the why ' r wherefore of it all . ? But hell , guys that 've been high-up bosses an ' even owners , ' r all of a sudden out on the streets lookin ' for jobs , an ' even them not havin ' any luck . " " Oh , Clair , " she said in a small voice . " You were trying so hard , and doing so well . ? I 'm sorry , for both you and Mr. Hatfield . " " Yeah . " He took another sip and shook his head slowly . " Poor old sunofagun was damnere cryin ' when he told me there was no way I could even have our Olds . He wanted me t ' have it , an ' there was only seven damn weeks ' more payments due on it . But ? " he shrugged . She leaned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Clair , what do you think is the best thing for us to do ? " " We 've got about thirty-six dollars . Fella I know , name of Ralph , is drivin ' out t ' California , an ' we c'n get a ride back t ' Utah with him , by payin ' f'r the gas . Your two sisters ' r there . " He hesitated . " ? An ' with them around , you an ' the kids 'll get along , somehow an ' whatever . " " What do you mean by that ? " " They 're a kind of a last resort . ? But nobody 's gon na go hungry , an ' nobody 's not gon na have no place t ' live , as long as I 'm around t ' make things work . " " Who ever said you 're not going to be around ? ! " " I mean just what I said b'fore , honey . I wo n't never stand by an ' let you an ' the kids go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very firmly down on the table , but when he spoke to her , he spoke gently . " Darlin ' , it 's a time when already hard times ' r gettin ' harder . An ' I ai n't never forgot that ? In My Merry Oldsmobile 223 that thought a ' doin ' whatever I have to , if need be , t ' make things work out all right f'r the three a ' you . " After a moment , Orlean somehow managed to grin slightly and even shake her head a little . " ? Every time things start getting bumpy , my husband decides to become the new John Dillinger of the U.S.A. " " That ai n't too bad an idea , " he nodded , grinning faintly back at her . " All that fella 's got that I ai n't , is a Thompson submachine gun . " " There 's a little bit more , " she said quietly . " And that is that you do n't have one mean bone in your whole body , you big , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " He laughed quietly . " Oh , yeah ? Well , I just killed one in a l ) oardin ' house two nights ago , or at least injured it severely . " I le paused , and then became serious . " You know I wo n't do anything wrong in this world , just as long as there 's some possible way t ' take care of you . " And then he became even more serious . " ? But if worse comes t ' worst in these here harsh an ' rugged times , then the devil 'll sure have t ' take the hindmost . ? B'cause it just ai n't nowhere in my nature t ' let you an ' them two kids git hungry , or not have no home , or for you t ' be hurtin ' in any kind a ' way . " " But , as long as you can get a job ? " she said . " As long as it 's a survival job . " " ? And , if you ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he said , " Then that there pussycat Dillinger will have if start takin ' some lessons . " She managed to smile at his half-joke , and tried to gently draw him further out of himself . " You really and surely do sound like a very frightening person . " He smiled back at her , but his troubled eyes stayed strong and level . " ? It 's just , when it comes if takin ' care of you an ' them two , I 'll always try if be as close in there as ten strong tigers . "
