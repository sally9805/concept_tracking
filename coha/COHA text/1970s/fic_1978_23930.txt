WELCOME TO THE ARROW CATCHERS FAIR A short story HE USUAL LONG BANNER with red lettering had been strung from tree to tree on the pasture 's edge : WELCOME TO THE ARROW CATCHER FAIR . The Indian was shooting arrows , first from a small straight bow of hardwood , then from stronger , surer bows , and the Arrow Catcher was catching them . A crowd of spectators had gathered , but not so large a crowd as would congregate later . Miss Golden RondeIle , the Arrow Catcher 's sister , cursed softly the two of them . " You low-lifed fugitive from the Indian Removal Bill , Redboy , if you shoot one more arrow at that sweet child , gotdoggit , I 'll .... " And , still softly , " Arrow Catcher , I swear before the tomb of Tishomingo I wish I 'd never paid for your shock therapy , you dried up little schizophrenic fart , you .... " There were a few snickers from the nearest spectators , but not many . Her voice was soft , and this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years longer than three-quarters of a century , a curse spanning all those years since , in a wooded glen of wild pecan and tupelo and sweet gum , a fiveyear-old child at the turning of the century caught his first arrow and became the Arrow Catcher . Of the three the Arrow Catcher was youngest , the baby : he was eighty-three . The fairgrounds covered a five-acre tract of flat but various ground , the well-mown bank of Roebuck Lake . Chickasaws in dugouts once floated upon these cypress-darkened waters past the single white-man 's cabin and , pointing , named the spot in their own tongue , biccauhggli , a word that once meant perhaps " home in the woods " and later became the name of the town standing upon this site , Big Ugly , Mississippi . There were camp tables and card tables and sawhorses laid with clean boards and covered with white tablecloths . Women set out hot casseroles and bowls of steaming vegetables and platters of sliced meats and fruit . There were Methodist folding chairs and Baptist coffee urns , there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were stacks of paper plates and boxes of plastic forks . There was a bluegrass band from Memphis , and theby Lewis Nordan community 's Bicentennial flag was flying . Charles Kuralt was rumored to be in town . There were bows and arrows everywhere , straight bows , recurved bows , hardwoods , fiber glass , laminations , longbows of yew , flat bows of lemonwood , steel bows with metal sights , stabilized bows , twins , monos , balls , and outriggers . There were all manner of archers , young and old , blind and sighted , crippled and crazy , those in uniforms and those near naked , Robin Hoods and college girls , snap shooters and practitioners of Zen , wheelchair archers and power archers , all of them in teams of two , an archer and a catcher , and in each team at least one who was willing to kill for the right to enter this competition and at least one willing to be killed for that right . Or so most of them probably told themselves , though it was not true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and while an arrow from a strong bow could knock a man down , injuries were rare . Most " misses ' . never touched the catcher , since a proper catch required at least a partial turning of the body , and arrow burns on the palms and fingers were the most common injury . Resin helped prevent blisters . The Arrow Catcher Fair was , all agreed , no threat to the health of Mississippians ; the true threat , according to local wags , was the annual Snuff Dipping Convention in Grenada . T HE FIRST ELIMINATION TRIALS were over . Last year 's champion had been put away early , an arrow catcher of about sixty-five and his archer grand-son . A youthful team from Montana made the first and second cuts and was as impressive as the rumors that preceded it here . There were other hopefuls as well , including a number of local teams . The crowds grew larger , most of their number only spectators . Couples and families gathered on the grounds , a sweet hint of marijuana smoke hung in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foot in the cool lake 's edge ; there clustered a family beneath a spreading cottonwood . The women 's competition was al-ready finished ; mixed team competition was in its last round . Charles Kuralt 's CBS van had been spotted for certain , and zo another rumor had it  --  the governor of the state was on the grounds again this year . The Montana team continued to practice , the archer standing at some forty yards ' distance from his catcher . The archer drew and the arrow was gone . The catcher did not watch the arrow because he could not , he watched only a furrow in the atmosphere where he knew it flew . He did not feel his body turn left at thirty degrees because now the turning was reflexive , he did not know how he knew to make his sudden move toward the colored density which was the arrow because that too was reflex , he did not know how he plucked the arrow from the air and held it vibrating in his astonished hand . There was a small , desultory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standing nearby . The Montana catcher tossed the arrow aside and waited for the next . T HE SCENE WAS REPEATED many times throughout the little fairgrounds , archers and catchers performing for each other . But it was not these moments of practice or even the more tense moments of competition that were the true center of the day . The center was the blood and flesh of the three ancients who were the original of this celebration , Redboy , Arrow Catcher , and Miss Golden , launching and catching and cursing , the first three human hearts to have quickened when the first wobbly arrow flew , a sharpened stick merely , almost fourscore years before from the Indian 's homemade bow . Golden 's brother lost his real name at the age of five when he became the Arrow Catcher , and though Golden remembered her brother 's birth that summer long ago on the mosquito-loud sleeping porch of their home where her schizophrenic helpless mother lay upon a mattress stuffed with the down of fowls killed and plucked by Golden herself and beneath a clean comforter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war , she was not certain she remembered her brother 's name . It might have been Gilbert . He had been the Arrow Catcher too long to remember . She remembered her father as a quiet , gentle ghost who long ago slipped away from her mother 's bedside and madness and was forgotten , who left before Arrow Catcher was born , and she remembered her mother only in bed , usually crying . Her memories survived from a time when the railroad came to Big Ugly . Her mother , beautiful and schizophrenic for manyyears before Mississippi even had a name for the problem , lay abed and wept and believed from the year 1894 until the day of her death that she herself was the train for which tracks were being laid near their home . " Chuffachuffa. " that sick woman called during hard labor . " Ch00000 ch0000000 , " she had cried in childbirth . She believed also that in the large old drafty house in which she lay there were narrow-gage rails on which in time of emergency she might fit her wheels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , both of which she expected almost daily . As a girl Golden sought and sought the tracks that her mother supposed lay upon their floors and never found them . For this folly she hated her mother . " Clickety-clack , clickety-clack , " the poor woman said , considering her escape . Golden hid in a cedar wardrobe and wished she understood . " Clickety-clack , elicketyclack . " Golden hated the railroad , the real one , the felling of the trees and the raising of great blackened timbers from which bark had been hacked for depot shingles , the timbers that would become the columns for the trestle across Roebuck , the iron and the hammers that made and laid the rails , the section gangs of bare-chested men , white and black , the oak that became the cross-ties and the rock that became the ballast , where in the clash and clatter and clutter and enormity of its building her mother 's mind would steal quietly out of town and never be heard from again and in which her brother would catch his first arrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the years of the railroad 's construction that Golden would first curse the Indian . " Listen to me , you no-count redskin , " the child-woman would say , cursing above the trundle and thunder of construction , the clink of steel upon steel chiming in her brain as the rails went down , the first arrow from the first little willow bow already in flight as she spoke , and yet hardly an arrow at all , a sharpened branch of wild pecan in wobbly career toward the little white boy 's bare frail breast , " if one of those pecan arrows hits my little brother , son , " she would say on that morning of a leafy-warm mid-June when the Mississippi Delta air was already dense and heavy and sweet with humidity and honeysuckle , " you wo n't be able to trade your greasy scalp and nappy ass together for a handful of strung beads , so gotdoggit , Redboy , just be careful . " The five-year-old boy , her brother , already at so early an age beginning to withdraw like his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else , except perhaps the Indian , successfully entered , picked the arrow from the air like a bursting-ripe wild plum from a laden tree , and became in that moment the Arrow Catcher . The red boy , older than the others but no one knew how old except that he was old enough to smell worse than the white children and most of the black ones , fitted another crude barreled shaft of pecan onto his bowstring and loosed a second shot . Golden Rondelle cursed him again . " You useless low-class wild Indian salvage bastard , " she cried , " shame on your shameful red ass shooting sticks at that sweet little child , you are shameful and useless as fits on a boar hog shooting arrows at that child . " The quiet small hand of the Arrow Catcher collected the second speeding shaft from the air as easily as he might a fat late-summer firefly lazy with August . The Indian child , handing his bow and a little clutch of arrows to Golden Rondelle , unhitched and took down his tattered filthy breeches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Goldie , " he said . " I got to dreen my lizard . " R EDBOY NO LONGER STANK , and his clothes were neither tattered nor dirty . Today at the Arrow Catcher Fair he was a quiet ancient little man , almost black and no more than five-feet-fourinches tall , the tight mahogany of his skin rendering his face almost invisible in contrast to the brilliance of his false teeth . He wore a carefully tailored sport jacket of a fashionable cut , deep burgundy in color . The lenses of his sunglasses were also shaded burgundy . In his hands he held his best bow , a recurved composite with an ebony grip and a fifty-five-pound draw weight . A leather ground-quiver of new arrows was stuck by its spike into the earth nearby . " Arrow Catcher , " said Golden Rondelle , trying again to remember whether they had named the child Gilbert and remembering only the down mattress and the unbleached muslin sheets and the comforter and remembering also the perfect little child , her brother , who had issued from her mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up from the cistern in a zinc bucket , remembering also the midwife , whom Golden called the granny-woman , the near-blind black woman who made the delivery , and remembering the clean glass jar of afterbirth and the placenta , which frightened her because she did not know what it was , and the strong white thread that cut the fleshy cord from her brother 's body , " that renegade is going to shoot a hole throughyou one of these days big enough for a hen turkey to jump through and where please tell me will you be then ? Dead is where so do n't bother to make reply , I do n't want to know . " " Hush up now , Miss Sister , " the Arrow Catcher said , or might have said if he still spoke , as he had not for sixty-five years , but saying as much to Golden in his unspeaking as other men said with a million words , speaking perhaps through his beatific smile . " Hush now , Miss Sister , it 's all right . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you were blessed from birth with the lowest blood pressure on the planet Earth and not enough sense to crap in a hole . " " Step back , Goldie , " the Indian said , polite as always . " You do n't want to give the boy reservations . " " Do n't you get ironical with me , Redboy , " she said , " because I have no reservations whatsoever about turning your hide into a Chickasaw hook rug and selling it in Oklahoma . And do n't shoot another arrow at that white boy until I say so , do you understand me , or I 'll make you think the Trail of Tears was the Amtrak Special to Miami , Gotdog . I ca n't stand an aboriginal . " The Indian chose an arrow from the ground quiver and inspected its fletching . Real feathers , four of them , and thick enough to slow the arrow drastically upon its leaving the bow . He liked to give the Arrow Catcher a few of these first , once he had started using the heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plastic fletching would come later . Then he would alternate a few , some slow arrows among the swiftest . Therein lay the Arrow Catcher 's true genius and mastery of time and space and the bodily organs . There was the reason the competition halted when the Arrow Catcher began work , and there was the reason the Arrow Catcher and the Indian were never a part of the competition and were never expected to be . Therein lay the artistry to which young men whose aspirations lay in the field of arrow catching aspired . He held the shaft lovingly in his hand , turning it . The blade  --  and this also was a difference between the Arrow Catcher and the rest the blade that the Indian held and that the Arrow Catcher would catch was a bodkin , a triple-edged hunters ' blade , solid sharp steel . " Do n't you do it . Redboy , do n't you even think about it . Do n't lay one more arrow on that string . " " Aw Goldie , come on now , hell , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think . " " Move back , Miss Sister , " the Arrow Catcher might have said , though there was no sound , " move back , please 'm . " " If you shoot that arrow , Redboy ... " The arrow was already gone . The bow from whose string the arrow flew was a precision instrument , a slender core of cedar laminated with fiber glass , and the arrow was not hardwood but a twenty-eight-inch tube of aluminum , a flu-flu arrow with three red fat turkey feathers and a yellow cock feather , an ariel ? hunting shaft , slow but with this bow faster than anything he had yet shot today . The arrow was in flight as the curse organized itself in Golden Rondelle 's brain and upon her lips . " ... 1 ' 11 fix you so ... " In near-invisible flight the arrow traveled the thirty brief yards that it would travel between its anchor point at the Indian 's chin and its destination in the Arrow Catcher 's hand or heart , the thick fletching bustling and ruffling against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorghum . LC ... your scalp wo n't sell for low-grade dog food ... " ... not even quite visible , the shaft of aluminum , merely a disturbance of the atmosphere , not only to Golden Rondelle but to her brother the Arrow Catcher , who both saw and did not see , heard and did not hear the flurry and hustle and rush and flutter of tumultuous gossiping feathers , and yet not invisible quite , something there in the sun , metallic and swift and formless , a thickening ... " ... I 'll sell your scalp to a chiropractor with Ohio license plates ... " ... and the Arrow Catcher , now as she watched him , seeing and not seeing , hearing for the first time distinctly the shaft bearing preening down upon him , turned , only slightly , to his left , dropping his shoulder , the left shoulder , ever so slightly , and grasped in a perfect marriage of firmness and gentleness , as one lifts a warm speckled egg from beneath an old hen , in the smallest portion of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no longer the whispering whistling lustering mystery it had been one second earlier in the air . It was a quick momentary hum and drone upon his hand 's flesh and in his ear wand then nothing , a shaft of aluminum , a bodkin , four bright feathers . He tossed the arrow aside . Golden was finished . Not all of the curse that passed through her mind was ever actually formed upon her tongue ; there had been no time . The curse faltered and sputtered to a halt , stopped . Her little brother was safe . " Let 's go grab us a bite of that chicken and potato salad , " said the Indian . " I 'm not eating fried chicken with an aboriginal , I can guarantee you that , Little Beaver , " said Golden Rondelle . T HEY STOPPED NOW and ate without speaking . The crowd around them began to disperse . On the public ad- dress there was an announcement for qualifiers in the late rounds and then another announcement concerning novelty events . The Arrow Catcher and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no coffee or tea , no stimulants . They rested and said nothing . Miss Golden sat apart from them , as she always did when the Indian was near , but in a position to see them both . She ate two helpings of bean salad with red onions . The final arrows of the competition were shot and caught , the young Montana team progressing through the final round but losing , as expected , to an experienced pair of brothers from Bellafontaine . The bluegrass group was better than last year 's , an energetic combination of banjos and harmonicas and guitars and a very tall younc , man with a washboard of elaborate design . young was the name printed on the drums . Later the lieutenant governor was introduced from the bandstand and was helped up to the microphone . He was received with polite applause , and when the microphone and speakers stopped squealing he began his annual address , " Welcome , friends , welcome to the Arrow Catcher Fair . " As it became clear to the audience that the band was taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around and moving away from the platform to other parts of the grounds . Still , some remained , and there was something about the speech that caught the ear of Miss Golden Rondelle . At first she could not hear well , so she turned and stood up , moving away from the Indian and the Arrow Catcher toward the speaker . She dropped the rest of the bean salad into a trash barrel . A few others had begun to listen as well , more than a few , a great many , though they had not intended to listen . The crowd moved back to the places where they had stood or sat for Bisquick and could not believe what they were seeing and hearing . The lieutenant governor was drunk and , whatever his subject , he was warming to it quickly . Charles Kuralt and CBS were filming and taping . The lieutenant governor pointed across the fairgrounds at the raised flag of the Bicentennial . He spoke of the people of this great and solemn state  --  sovereign state , illhe had meant to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying solemn again and again . Miss Golden was at last close enough to hear , and now the noises of the crowd were " The crowd was dumbstruck . They were both moved to laughter and unable to laugh . They were silent and horrified , they were mass silence masking hysteria . " quieting rapidly . The lieutenant governor had found his proper distance from the microphone and his voice rocked the Arrow Catcher Fair like a calliope . Many were listening now , and others were on their way . The speech continued , wildly , the lieutenant governor borrow . ing freely from the Sermon on the Mount and Lincoln 's Gettysburg Address and anything else that came to mind . " Hernando by-God de Soto , " she heard him say . " Hernando buggering de Soto , " he was saying , " great spic founder of this solemn state ... " This was not the first time the lieutenant governor had embarrassed the state but it was the first time on national television and , as everyone must correctly have supposed , it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for could there be any doubt that the governor would have him executed ? " ... led a band of eccentric white men through this stinking buckshot and gumbo shithole that tries to pass for the real world and began , " he said , " by mating with the abominable Chickasaw and Choctaw to people our solemn shores with lunatics , made these alluvial fields and pastures and piney woods and swamps and bearcats and all our abominations of geography America 's first and last rich stronghold of lunacy and feeble-mindedness and dwarfism in a proud and unhappy land ... " The crowd was dumbstruck . They were both moved to laughter and unable to laugh . They were silent and horrified , they were mass silence masking hysteria . Every man and woman among them was scandalized and stood in dread of some unnamed impending doom about to fall like acid rain upon the state and this pasture . Those who liked the lieutenant governor and those who despised him were equally scandalized and horrified , those who voted for him and those who had threatened him with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Catcher Fair . ... proud of our individualism in Mississippi , " he was saying , " individually , man for man , woman for woman , child for child , the most individually obscene and corrupt populace and geography , save only Los Angeles and Gary , Indiana , in an entire obscene civilization ... " To all who watched and listened , it was finally clear : this was no ordinary drunken scene at a fair . This was no ordinary exhibition of a failed man and a ruined rummy politician . This was the ugly deliberate song of a mortally wounded political swan , a deliberate humiliation of the governor and of the entire state . " This is Charles Kuralt " was the phrase which in this crowd every mind 's ear heardupon every mind 's evening news , " on the road . Welcome to the Arrow Catcher Fair . " Someone rushed from the crowd to find out whether the governor had yet left the fairgrounds . A large red-haired , red-faced man stood reduced to tears , begging Charles Kuralt please to stop the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying , " of our individualism , proud of our pain , we are proud of our neurotic romanticism and our feelings of inferiority , proud of our pathetic apologies and of our pathetic failures to apologize , proud of the bloody stains of our guilt , we are proud of our psychotic rage never to question or wonder and always to justify and create ... " A shout came from the crowd . The governor was on his way , someone cried . Make way for the governor . There was a sudden release of the silent storm inside the crowd , a partial release anyway , a flurry of whispers and uncertain movement and coughing . " Come on down , Lee , " an older man at the foot of the platform said to the speaker , " come on down , man , that said again , pointing again irrationally at the flag and again no less careless of historical accuracy , " to have become inhabitants of this blessed land of perversity , founded by an insane Spaniard in his insane and successful discovery of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , potent puissant pregnant pointless pissant stream ! That very snakish flood in which God 's own unholy self of the Holy Ghost resides , yea verily I say unto you , even unto this day in the form of an alligator gar , molded from the Mississippi clay by God 's own mighty hand upon Christ 's eternal wheel in prescient anticipation of our present governor 's mind and soul and face , I have a dream , brothers and sisters , I have a dream ... " Two state troopers in uniform mounted the bandstand and tried to lead him gently away . He would not be led . Both troopers , trying not to face the whirring cameras , were embarrassed literally to tears . They tugged at him and he would not move . There was a scuffle , a brief struggle , which the lieutenant governor won because the troopers were unsure what to do , how much force to use . " Turn off the camera , Mr. Kuralt , please Jesus just turn it off . " one of the troopers begged , directly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unnoticed , across the pasture , the Indian and the Arrow Catcher had begun work again , shooting arrows and catching them . Golden Rondelle , in these first stirrings of a recog-nition of the futility of her own bitterness , had forgotten to watch out for her brother . She was not there to curse them . 44 . . ? I have a dream , " said the lieutenant governor , kicking at those who would restrain him , " of the scaly , snouted gar-God and life-giver and life-destroyer of all Mississippians submerged in the bloody rivers of our lands ? and hearts ... " He held the microphone in a passionate triumphant death-grip , the state troopers tugging hopelessly at his shirt . The governor of the state , a handsome man in a white Prince Albert suit , mounted the platform , grappling with the lieutenant governor for the microphone , but in the confusion could not wrest it from him . One of the troopers , suddenly feeling sorry for the lieutenant governor , began to fight on his side . Fists flew , none @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eternal sustainer of our inherited alluvial madness and more green-headed mallard drakes in the rice brakes than you can shake a shitty stick at , hand me up that Co-Cola bottle , sonny , I got to dreench my weasle ... " His words were becoming incoherent now and crazy and something in them and behind them  --  it was the distant but very real sound of a diesel freight which Golden did not know yet that she heard  --  made her remember what she had forgotten , the Indian and her little brother . Frantic , she looked behind her , far across the astonished flood of faces , and saw the two of them . " Arrow Catcher ! " she screamed , already pushing through the crowd . " Redboy ! " People stepped aside for her , she bumped against them roughly , making her way . " Red-boy , do n't do it ! Arrow Catcher ! This is the hour of your death ! " On the bandstand there was a second , more violent struggle , and this time the speaker was subdued . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cursing . The microphone crashed to the earth , the amplifier screaming , the lieutenant governor grabbing for it and pulling it to him where he lay . Several men fell on top of the downed lieutenant governor , the two troopers and the governor among them , scuffling and scratching and punching . " Goddamn this very delta earth beneath our feet , " boomed the calliope voice of the amplifiers , " goddamn these spreading trees , goddamn these matchless Mississippi blue skies . " These were the last words audible in the struggle . The train was approaching the trestle . Gold-en 's only thought was of death ; she could not say why . " It is the hour of your death , dear Lincoln , " she cried to her brother . " Do n't re-lease the arrow , Redboy , or Lincoln will die ! " So that was the child-man 's name , she thought , her brother 's name . Lincoln , not Gilbert . She had remembered . It seemed impossible that she should ever have forgotten . She shoved and jostled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but slowly . Lincoln had caught two arrows since she started making her way toward him . At last she broke through the unsteady crust of the crowd 's edge and began running , as fast as she could , old woman with the yellow hoot and rumble of the diesel in her ears , across the pasture , straight for her brother . She was still screaming . Lincoln had caught another arrow . T HERE WAS TIME somehow to wonder at the coincidence of the lieutenant governor 's insane speech and the approach of the train to the trestle . She wondered whether it was really a coincidence at all that these two things should happen just as she remembered her brother 's name . She believed rather that on this instant she had suddenly become old enough and wise enough and bitter enough to swim beyond her lost childhood and bitterness and to take all the earth 's available phenomena , natural , mechanical , and political , and shape them into meaning . The speech from the platform had made her old enough ; the approach of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the voice of memory . She ran toward her brother , screaming . She reached him , calling his name , Lincoln Lincoln Lincoln . She touched him . As she did , as her hand felt the soft fabric of his shirt and felt through the fabric the tense little muscles of her brother 's shoulder , she thought , Uh-oh . She thought , I should n't have done this . Redboy has not seen me , he sees nothing but his target . He hears nothing . An arrow will be leaving his bow soon and my hand on this little shoulder may distract , may prevent my brother from catching it . She wondered if the arrow would hit her brother , or if it would hit herself . It could scarcely be hoped to miss both of them . Or could it ? He had never missed before , not once in decades . But he had never been touched upon the shoulder while trying . Oh dear , oh shit . Too late the Indian saw Golden Rondelle move into the tunnel of his pinpoint-focused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the concentrated entirety of his attention . Too late he saw that the bowstring was no longer in his fingertips , that the arrow was already inexorably launched . " Too late the Indian saw Golden Rondelle move into the tunnel of his pinpoint-focused vision , the narrow squinty line of sight that was the concentrated entirety of his attention . " The arrow carried a broadhead , a razor-sharp hunting blade of triangular shape , and the fletching was sleek swift plastic . She thought , though there was no time for thought , that the sound of the train , both the remembered steam engine in her mind and the yellow diesel not forty yards away on the trestle , was the sound of her pathetic mother 's voice : " Chuffa-chuffa. " during labor . " Ch000000 ch0000000 , " during birth . " Clickety-clack , " in her imagined escape from fire and flood and probably from everything else that this handkerchief-sized spot of earth had meant to her . As the train approached the trestle , Golden thought that not far from here where we stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If children were today . the same as they had been so many years ago , they were hiding in the great ditch bordering the tracks , waiting in lespedeza and Johnson grass and wild chinaberries , children black and white and even red , boys and girls , waiting for the train to slow almost to stopping before it crossed the Roebuck trestle . There were children , she thought , at this moment waiting until the last possible second to rush from their hiding to grab the cold ladder of a boxcar , to pull themselves shrieking and squealing and swinging aboard . These children would , as Golden and Redboy and Lincoln had done , ride the train across the trestle triumphant and then , like the lieutenant governor , jump suicidal to safety before the train took speed again on the other side . The voice of the train was the voice of her mother naming rivers , as sometimes for hours she would do , the rivers and tributaries of Mississippi , most of them with Chickasaw and Choctaw names , the rivers she would cross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowed to roll free at last from the bed of her affliction and confusion and from the geography that had confused her .

" faster and faster , into the final register , crossing at full tilt the mighty river at Greenville , not even bothering to slow down for the trestle , " Tallahatchie Tallahatchie Mississippi Mississippi Mississippi , wh00000 wh0000000 ! " headed west , westward westward forever and away . And if there are children there today , she thought , - waiting in their secret ditch for thetrain , this yellow diesel , was there not also in the reeds among them a little girl , as once she had been , whose mother was too sick ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reedy ditch or on the boxcar 's rusty ladder one who , like Golden Rondelle , reared her mother and was not reared by her ? who reared her brother and forgot her father and forgot her brother 's name ? and before that a child who watched , still holding the zinc bucket so heavy with sweet water that it cut into her little palm , her brother 's painful emergence like that of a train from a tunnel unimaginably deep and dangerous ? a child whom first she would protect as a man-child and then , as he joined his mother , and somehow also the Indian , in a netherworld in which he might escape his original emergence , protect him as a child-man ? Was there a child in the blackberry vines this moment as the arrow flew who found for so many years no source from which to draw either strength or sweetness and so drew it from within herself , from the deep cistern of heart behind the sweet face which no mother ever told her was beautiful , though then it was and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , drawing from this deep but finite source , unreplenished and unreplenishable , until she became almost as crazy as her mother and brother ? And yet a child who , after so long , did love her brother and loved , at least in this insane moment , the strange memory of her strange sick mother and felt , painfully , an emotion for the Indian that she had carried inside her for so long and which even now in its sweetness she found impossible to give a name , knowing , however , something of that emotion because for so many years she had seen it shared between Lincoln and the Indian in their dangerous necessary game of habitual love made possible by death 's terrible , sweet omnipresence . Golden watched , though there was no time to watch , and saw , though even the slow arrows were invisible , the loosed arrow as it left its place upon the bow and string , this fastest and most dangerous of arrows . It seemed to bend upon the bow , first right then left , then to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a deadly arrow and , as it slammed shut the distance between the archer and the catcher and as her fingers ' grip tightened upon her brother 's shoulder , she remembered that the Indian 's name was Gilbert . So , she thought , that was why she had been mixed up . So Gilbert is the Indian 's name , she thought . Hmm . Well , it 's not a bad name , not at all . It 's a nice name . But it 's a damn strange name for an Indian .
