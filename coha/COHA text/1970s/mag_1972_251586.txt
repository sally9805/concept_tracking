" Joshua , Joshua , " shouted the crowd of 75,000 at an agricultural fair west of Kingston last week , as the tall , ramrod-straight politician with the familiar features began to speak . Many Jamaicans once regarded their former Prime Minister , Norman Manley-who died in 1969-as a kind of Moses who helped lead them to the promised land of independence ten years ago . Now they see his son as an appropriate successor . Addressing the massive rally . Prime Minister Michael Manley , 48 , set forth what has become a chief theme of his young government : " What freedom really confers is the opportunity to be totally responsible for one 's own fate . " <P> Energetic and articulate , " young Michael " Manley has brought new confidence , style and warmth to the traditionally conservative island politics . Swept to a landslide victory over the Labor Party last February on a platform of " love power , " he has used his office to persuade his countrymen to shed some of the unhappier legacies of British rule . " One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he told TIME 'S Bernard Diederich , " is the tendency to come out of a dependent situation with a psychology of dependence . " To help make the point , Manley has broken with the British shirt-and-tie tradition by wearing a kareba-a short-sleeved , open-neck jacket and matching pants outfit-in Parliament . He even wore one at his wedding last June to Radio and Television Announcer Beverly Anderson . <P> Manley has set himself no less a task than that of freeing his countrymen from the colonial assumption that " somebody else is going to do it all for me . " When workmen in Kingston recently balked at cleaning drainage ditches , Manley himself took up a shovel and began to dig . " All sorts of people who had refused to work later joined me , " he recalled . " But if I had gone down in jacket and tie and made a great speech about the dignity of labor , they would have said : ' That 's for the birds , ' and they would have been right . " <P> Jamaica , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unholy trinity of poverty , malnutrition and unemployment . The islands ' economies are often tied to single crops-sugar and bananas - that fetch low prices on world markets . They can not mechanize agriculture to cut costs and raise incomes because that would only aggravate unemployment , which runs as high as 25% in Jamaica . The result is low productivity and per capita incomes that range from about $65 a year in Haiti to $555 in Jamaica , one of the more prosperous of the Caribbean islands .
