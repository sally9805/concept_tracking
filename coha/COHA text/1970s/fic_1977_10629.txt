right sometimes , and the successes were what kept the staff to their dedication , kept them working through failure after failure . This child was almost-right , and this time David Holland was relieved of the necessity of signing the red-bordered slip that meant cancellation of a failed experiment . Over the years there bad been many times when he had been forced to initial such an order . Each time the burden of following guilt seemed unbearable , until it seemed as though he could not bear anotherstroke laid to his personal torment . One of these times , lie knew , he would break .. . He thought again of his son , dedicated to bringing another race to the stars at the time when man was in danger of losing them for himself . Would Clay 's work be more successful than his father 's ? David Holland had always known that the probability of success in his program was scant at best , and long ago had opted against escape . Suicide would be an easy way out , but his moral construction was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was a most terrible burden , for it was almostcertain that the survival of human intelligence , of the race as rational , thinking organisms , depended on the work of this one Project ... . A Project outlawed for three centuries . Holland tried to shake off depression . This child would live to successful adulthood , and in a week there would be another birthing . One birth a week was not enough , but it was all they could manage at present  --  until they proved success . The black mood refused to lift . The burden of guilt was too great to ease his conscience from the long series of high crimes against his own race . Without David Holland , man might indeedsink into the morass . . . With him , the race might well die.  |p19Clay  woke to the dying ebb of a headache that seemed to have spread over his entire body . He lay still a moment , afraid to open his eyes , and decided that no , the aching was confined to his bones , his skeletal structure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and new pain exploded through the soft parts of his body . Air rushed from his lips as he swallowed a scream , his hands clawing at an unyielding surface . He opened his eyes . He was staring at a ceiling that seemed to be made of rushes , although light was feeble . But as he dragged one foot up toward his midbody , twisting his trunk again , the first pain diminished , becamealmost bearable . He gulped chilled air through open lips , his stomach suddenlygrowling and rolling . The hunger pang was sharp ; he was completely empty , which meant that he had been out for at least twelve hours . He turned his head to look at the opposite wall . IIe was lying on a high pallet that was barely long enough for him , covered by a single rough-textured blanket . The room was no more than a slot in the thick wall , two meters wide , three metersdeep , three meters tall . Crudely dyed hangings covered the door , and the only illumination came from a smoking oil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than a padded wooden slab . The only other furnishing in the room was a tall pedestal bearing a washbowl . Clay sat up , feet dangling over the edge of the pallet but still centimeters from touching the floor . His outer robes had beenp20stripped away , leaving him wearing only the short tunic that was the standard off-worlder 's protection against the rough nativefabric , preventing constant chafing and crotch itch . The ambient air temperature was no more than fifteen degreesabove the freezing point , and he shivered . But before he could do anything the hangings were swept back and a young woman in the robes of a temple servitor entered . She carried a silver tray that bore a steaming bowl . " Good day , " she said , her voice musical . " Good day , " he returned  --  and then Clay realized that she spoke in Standard . She was short , and looked like a native . As such , she was an attractive specimen of her race . If she were Terran , however , an agent like himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm cold , " Clay said . " Where are my clothes ? " " The night winds from the plains are always cold , " said the girl , placing the tray at the foot of the pallet . She bent to bring his robe from a shelf beneath the bed . " Night ? " Clay seized on the word , comparing it with his physical state . " How long have I been here ? " " More than a day . I was not on duty when they carried you in , but I understand that it was at evening services . Perhaps thirty hours . " He digested the information , dropping to the floor  --  and immediatelyregretted the movement . The stone blocks of the floor seemed coated with hoarfrost . He danced a bit as he slipped into the robe , then found his fleece-lined boots on the same shelf . The girl laughed , gently , as he jumped back onto the pallet to finish dressing . " Winter is almost upon us , " she said . " Fortunately the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me ? " asked Clay , picking up the bowl containing his breakfast . It appeared to be a plain meal cereal , but when he brought the spoon to his lips he found the taste sweetened , nutlike . It was pleasant , satisfying to his empty stomach , and he ate quickly.  | " You were felled by the subsonics generated by the Sanctum during call to evening service , " said the girl . The thief . " My filters were stolen . " " More than that , " she said . " Your shield transplants were never activated . They were shut off when the doctor checked you . Clay touched the large bone behind his right ear , pressing gently . He could feel the outline of the tiny box that had replaced a circular centimeter chip of bone . The box contained a communicator good over a short range , perhaps a dozen kilometers . A similar transplant behind his left ear contained the shield , which was supposed to protect against the sonic generatorsthat were the only ancient scientific device known on Karyllia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the source , the shield needed supplementation ; thus the filters . There was no question now that this girl was a fellow agent . No Karyllian would have been privy to the secrets of the shield transplant , although natives were used wherever possible as servantsand servitors , masking the underlying secrets of the temple . " The shields checked out on Earth , " said Clay . The girl shrugged . " They were n't defective  --  they just were not switched on . " The shields worked before he left Academy , taking ship to Karyllia . The switches were electronic rather than mechanical  --  which meant that deactivation could only have taken place during the weeks he spent at the space station in final orientation . It must have been done during one of the medical or equipment checks  --  but deliberately ? or by accident ? It must be the latter , Clay decided . Why would anyone wish him harm ? " I 'm in the temple ? " he asked , although the answer was obvious . The girl smiled , a motherly creature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year or so older than Clay . He tried to remember anyone like her at Academy , but could not . " Martin managed to bring you within the temple screen , al/though he threw out his back in the effort . It is quite fortunate for you that his appearance belies his ability . " She picked up the now empty bowl , placed it back on the tray , and started to leave . Clay jumped to the floor again , protesting . " Hey , do n't just walk off ! " She seemed amused . " You 'll have another visitor soon enough . " She backed through the hangings as Clay realized that she had n't given him her name . He pushed through after her to find that he was in a low-ceilinged corridor . This side was lined with a long row of cubicles just like the one he had just left , but the other wall was blank . There was no sign of the girl , although it did not seem possiblethat she could have disappeared so quickly . He held up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were all in darkness , apparently empty . The light level in the corridor was almost as bad as in the littleroom , illumination coming only from smoking torches in iron brackets , some of which had exhausted their oil soakings . Clay moved along the corridor for perhaps fifty paces , the first pain of awakening now diminished to where it could be ignored . The corridor bent sharply to the right , although not at a ninety-degree angle . When Clay looked down the new length , it seemed to be exactly like the section he had just left . Not ready to start an exploration of the building on his own , he returned to his cubicle . There he looked the little cell over carefully , but saw nothing more obvious than that noticed earlier . The long shelf beneath the bed now held nothing more than two native blankets and a lidded oval pottery container . He lifted the lid and smelled disinfectant , but it was several minutes before he realized the importance of the chamber pot . The place seemed to be exactly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was not under constant monitoring , but he lacked the instruments with which to make even the simplest sweep of the room . His curiosity not satisfied but his explorations completed for the moment , Clay pulled himselfp23back onto the bed to await the coming of the promised visitor . Clay was instantly aware , watching from hooded eyes , as a priest entered the cell . Like himself , the man was far taller than the average native , although most of the Earthmen on the planet had been selected , like the girl he had met earlier , to blend in with the local races . But the supply of trained agents was not sufficient to permit a total adherence to the ideal . The newcomer was cowled , unusual here within the temple proper , Clay knew . Then he recognized something familiar about the form , even though the face remained hidden . He stiffened in surprise . " Peter ? " The cowl was swept back , the man revealed smiling . " I should have known better than to try to fool you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you were back on Earth . " Peter Stone shrugged ; he was a close friend of Clay 's parents . All of Clay 's memories of childhood included Stone as a part of the family grouping , with the Hollands more often than not . " I assure you that I 'm not here because of my insatiable desire for field duty , " said Stone . " However , certain matters appearto be coming to a head , and there are those on Earth who thought the place to counteract them was here on Karyllia . " " That makes no sense , " said Clay . " It does to a politician . Come , let 's get out of here , to some place warmer if not more comfortable . " Clay jumped down from the pallet , wincing . " Are all the beds here this hard ? " " Eh . Oh no  --  not quite . I believe it was the medic 's decision to leave you on the slab . You can have a tick tonight , though you 'll scarcely find it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the corridor and through a maze of twists and turns and clips , although very shortly he could not have said whether they were descending into the depths of the building or rising into the walls . They passed apparentnatives dressed in servitors ' robes , who bowed theirp24heads in respect as they saw Stone 's priestly robes . None of them spoke , however , and Clay could not guess whether they were natives or agents . Then they descended a long flight of steps , coming out at last into a large common room . It was filled with rough tables , the walls lined with both upholstered and plain benches ; a few priests lounged in the area . Stone paused to speak to a man at a small table by the entrance , then led Clay farther , into an office that was little more than another cell , although much larger . " None of the comforts of home , Clay , " said Stone , sitting behind a rough-hewn table . He motioned the youth to a crude wooden chair , and leaned back . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Clay shrugged . " Unless you have reason to keep me igno-rant . " Stone chuckled , then said , " What do you know of the presentpolitical situation back on Earth , Clay ? " Clay blinked , the question taking him by surprise . He shook his head . " Little enough  --  what we 've been taught in sociometrics , and what I 've picked up from the entertainment tapes , I suppose . " " Historically , " said Stone , " politics has been a game , althoughone played by a very dirty set of rules . Politicians heed the call to power , although few of them can properly handle it . Some years back the psychometricians ran a test program on the entire council , and found that every member of it was sociologicallyunsuited to a position of control . Needless to say , that report was never published . " Clay listened intently , comfortable in Stone 's presence . As a child he had early turned his eyes to the stars , but his first ambitionhad been toward the probe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew that the man across the desk had been instrumental in turning him to his present field , although he could not recall at what age he had decided to becomea Guide Agent . Stone had always been connected with Academy , and there had been two periods of more than a year each when he hadp25vanished from sight . He had never made explanations for his absences , but now Clay realized that he had been on field duty on either Karyllia or Locane . The boy grew used to the interludes , Stone suddenly absent and then perhaps fifteen months later suddenly back . " What do you know of the Reformationists ? " Clay shrugged . " Capital libertarians , some such nonsense . Are n't they the ones who wish to restore the rights of individualsto hold property ? " " That is one of their stated goals . " " They 're very noisy , " said Clay , recalling news tapes . " They seem to like stirring up the drones , always disrupting public meetings  --  usually those which are none of their business . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not been Declassified . " " There are powerful men among them , " said Stone . " The Reformationists are winning many adherents among the producingclasses , and it seems likely that they will be naming the new government after the next elections . What do you know of the Humanity Firsters ? " " Crackpots , " said Clay , without hesitation . " Opposed to star flight , the Guided Worlds policy , and , I suppose , rain on Sunday . " Stone smiled . " Close enough  --  in fact , a very good description of their public activity . The Firsters would appear to be classic aginers , the outs as opposed to the elitist ins . " He shifted in his chair , crossing his legs and folding his hands over his knees . " The Firsters may very well be crackpots in nature , Clay , but they are also dangerous . More important , and more dangerous , they are very closely allied to the Reformationistparty . " " That lacks logic , " said Clay . " Nevertheless , it is true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exists . The Firsters are the front for the true aim of the Reformationists . Even though you think the Reformationistsare noisy , the Firsters are the activists  --  the Reforma/tionists are the planners . Together they wish to create a new order in the human-dominated worlds of the galaxy . " " Except for the colonies , there are no such worlds , " said Clay . " They count Karyllia and Locane with the colonies , " said Stone . " Mm . " Clay thought over Stone 's words . " What effect does that have on us , on our role here ? The Agency is forbidden by the Compact from being involved with the internal matters of Earth . " " The Agency is restricted , Clay , but we as individuals have not lost our rights as citizens . Ours is a free society to those competent enough to win and hold the franchise , and any citizenis free to engage in political activity . Karyllia is of the utmostimportance , I assure you , to the plans of both the Reformationistsand the Firsters . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the younger man . " The Firsters are not just spouting rhetoric , Clay  --  they mean what they say in their proclamations . They very much believethat there is room in the galaxy for only one race of man  --  Earthman . It is their intention to destroy every intelligence that threatens competition with Earth 's dominance . " Stone seemed suddenly aged . " The Firsters do not want Contact between the races . They will not  --  can not  --  permit us to succeed here , or on Locane . They are not gentle in their opposition  --  evennow they are planning a bloodbath that will scourge the face of both guided planets . "  |p27David  Holland felt a gentle touch on his arm and shifted , pulling away . Sleep still held him lightly as the touch came again , and he refused the summons , eyes still closed tightly . He turned on his side , reaching for his pillow to pull it over his head . " David ! " The touch was more insistent , tugging , and now the smell of Janice 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called him again . " Uff ! Go ' way ! What time is it ? " Rolland screwed up one eye , but from this position could n't see a clock . " Seventeen hundred , " replied Janice . " We 've slept half the clock away , David . " It had been nearly 0500 when they finally made it to bed this morning ; this was the first time in weeks that Holland had managed a complete sleep cycle without interruption . The extra five hours were an unexpected bonus , and now he felt lazy . " I like it here , " he said . " I 'm not going to get up until next week . " " Oh yes you are , " said Janice . " We have to be at the Letermeistersin an hour for the buffet , and you know how Charles is when people are late . " " Umm . " He acknowledged the statement by throwing back the cover , but it was a minute before he sat up . " Another politicalaffair  --  you know how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " All of Charles 's affairs are political , David . Now hurry and shower , and you can have ten min/utes on the table . I 've already keyed it  --  a massage will do you good . " Holland felt good as he stood , stretching the last sleep from his body . The sense of well-being was rare , but if a single satisfyingsleep could produce it he 'd have to try and reorder his routine to permit it more often . The problems of the lab and the Project seemed far away at the moment . A stiff evening breeze was blowing the curtains into the room . Holland made his way around his side of the bed , his movements automatic as he avoided the articles of furniture intruding into the limited area . He paused by the glass doors to the balcony , leaning to grasp the rail , his eyes sweeping out across the Bay of Fundy . The air was unusually clear as autumn evening approached ; he could see the hazy line that was Nova Scotia , fifty-five kilometers away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the white sand beach except the ten-meter wall that cut off the noncitizens of New Brunswick from the pleasures of the water . The beach had been painstakingly built to serve the privileged classes of the district only . As holders of the yellow , David and Janice Holland were of the very highest citizen class and entitled to such special privilegesas this exclusive apartment , which contained nearly thirty square meters in its three rooms . When Clay had entered school his father opted to pay the extra tax and keep the boy 's room as a study . It was a decision he occasionally regretted , for during the years he had rarely been able to enjoy the private space . Only the most highly placed members of the government ranked higher than holders of the yellow , and even they had no more personal space than the Hollands . David went into the ' fresher to dial his shower . A quick cycle of hot , cold , and then gentle warm , and he came out of the needle spray feeling years younger . A sharp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the table and let the robot fingers begin the massage , he sniffed , hungrily . Then it was gone , and he decided that he must have been wrong . His stom/ach reminded him that he had not eaten before going to bed , however , and when he came out of the ' fresher the was pleased to see Janice setting two places at the small table at the foot of the bed . Then the aroma hit him again , and he grinned happily . " Coffee ! Real coffee  --  have you been trading on the black market ? " " I 've been hoarding a half-kilo , " she replied , pouring his cup full . " For how long ? " he demanded . She smiled . " Long enough . I ca n't think of a better time to use it , David . The stimulant will help us keep our wits tonight , and I think perhaps I should bring it down to the lab . We 'll certainly need it this next week , during the sweep . " Holland sat down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouthful . It had been years since there had been a decent coffee crop  --  it was one of the plants that refused to adapt to conditions in space , so that it was now strictly a high luxury item . He recalled hearing that there was only one plantationleft now , which probably meant that the crop was reserved for government officials . " Is this all ? " he said , dismayed , as he surveyed the single soya cutlet on his plate and the small glass of citric blend . " I 'm hungry , Janice ! " " You 'll be nibbling all evening at the buffet , " she said , firmly . " You always have food in your fingers at these affairs . " " A defense mechanism , " he said , after draining the glass and while cutting the cutlet . " If my mouth is full , I do n't have to make idiot conversation . " " You should make more conversation , " said his wife . " It wo n't hurt to have friends at court . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is my friend . " " Fortunately for the Project , yes . However , be is also Commissionerof Science , and holds a seat at the President 's Table . Charles Letermeister is only one man , and it would help to have some of the other commissioners on our side . " It was an old argument , and one that Holland now shruggedp30off . He rose , wiping his lips , and started to dress for the evening , the breeze uncomfortably cool on his naked skin as the sun started to set . Janice had changed while he was in the ' fresher ; now she cleared the table , made final adjustments to her make-up and coiffure , and was ready as her husband summonedtheir evening capes from the closet . He called for an aircar and they took the lifttube to the roof . Another couple was waiting in the pavilion ; Holland vaguely recognized them , thought the fellow was a factory manager or something of the sort . If so , he held no higher than green , and that meant that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a view over the city of St. John rather than the bay . Holland nodded , and a moment later they were gone in their aircar . Janice shook her head . " They think we 're terrible snobs , David . " " Eh ? Why ? We 've given them no reason to think that . " " No , and no reason to think otherwise . At the buffet try not to consider every stranger automatically an enemy , please . For me , if not for yourself . " IIe shrugged , agreeing , thinking that he had little time for social amenities , and even less interest . Then the car was there and they climbed in , Holland presenting his ID and the addressto the robot controller . A moment later they were moving over the towers of the city toward Government Center . As soon as she was seated Janice reached to turn on the citizen'schannel on the communicator . A bored young woman was reading the district weather forecast ; Holland scarcely glanced at the screen . It had been years since he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ busy to have time for leisure activities of even a sedentary nature . But he felt good now . He looked at his wife , saying , " I think your idea of a general holiday is a good one . It 's been years since I 've had the chance to do any skiing  --  what say we apply for passes to the Andes ? " She smiled , patting his hand . " If you like , David . " Holland glanced at the screen again , distracted by the switchp31to a news reader , a man . He disappeared a moment later , replaced by another woman . They all seemed to possess the same droning monotone . At that , though , it was better than listening to the mindless pap spewing out of the public channel . The drivel for the drones poured twenty-four hours a day out of the main communication satellite , for even as the approaching night brought lights out to a district 's barracks , eight hours to the east another district was waking to the same mindless pacifier . The sun was nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city deep in darkness ; only the highest towers were still touched by the rapidly vanishing rays . Then the screen suddenly switched to a street location , where a torchlight demonstration was being held . The camera was far back , but the sound of the crowd 's yells was a steady background roar to the commentator'svoice . " It 's the Humanity Firsters , " said Janice . " They 're at GovernmentCenter , David . " Holland grunted . " From the looks of the crowd , the Firsters ' goons must have swept the nearest barracks clean . Turn it off . " " We should hear what they 're saying , " his wife protested . " They 're screaming what they always scream , " said her husband . " Simpletons , the lot of them . " The question became moot as the car passed over the protectivescreen around the government building complex and settledtoward the roof port . For a moment David could see the crowd in the street , and then they were in darkness . As he and Janice stepped out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that might have been the crowd 's roar . Holland shrugged , steeling himself for the ordeal ahead as he took Janice 's cape and handed the two outer garments to a robot checker , accepting a claim button in return . Then they went into the drop shafts , coming out some twenty floors below where the main reception hall was located . The lobby was broad and high-ceilinged , the tiled floor sprouting innumerabletall pots of greenery . There was a human greeting the guests at the entrance to thep32reception suite , a holder of the lowest classification of citizenship , the blue . There were millions as qualified in the barracks , although few were needed to do the minimum amount of work that required human hands but no particular intelligence . The rewards of the blue were small compared to the benefices of the upper classes , but still a giant leap above the dismal life of the drones . Most of the workers on Holland 's staff were technicians , and entitled to the rose cards , which in status were only just above the blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machinery of society running , and for those qualified enough , or adept enough at politics , there was the chance to rise through the classes to the green and even the yellow . Janice had started as a rose , while Holland himself had been an orange , picked out at birth for indicated potential that proved itself quickly when he finally entered school . He was a born administrator , and had served in several capacities while still very young . For the past thirty years , however , he had been in charge of the Project , placed there by his friendship with Charles Letermeister . Who came forward to greet them now . He bowed low in a courtly manner , taking Janice 's hand in his own and touching his other fingers to the back of it . " Janice , David . So happy you could come . " " As though we had a choice , Charles , " said Janice , smiling . Letermeister shrugged . " Do any of us have a choice , ever ? Wiley is already here . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hollands followed the gesture to see the tall , patrician head of Senator Wiley in the middle of an active group . He was looking their way , and nodded , smiling . Then he turned away , his attention caught by one of those about him . " The senator 's staff have been pressing my department , " said Letermeister . " The old fox has wind of something , you may be sure . " " About the Project ? " Janice asked , quickly . " I wish I knew . " He shrugged again , and then his eye wasp33caught by newer arrivals . " Excuse me . We 'll find time to talk later , David , under the shield . " He was gone then , and Holland found himself in the midst of a drifting mass of humanity . There were several hundred alreadypresent , and more arriving every moment ; it was beginning to seem as though everyone in the district above the rose had been invited . He moved toward the buffet tables as Janice had known he would , filling a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greetings at acquaintances and faces that seemed familiar . Janice was more animated , joining in a numberof conversations , drifting away for a few moments . Then she came back , her eyes glowing with excitement . " They 're going to dance patterns . Please  --  come with me ! " He shook his head . " Sorry , my love , but you know that I am completely lacking in co-ordination for such adventures . Here 's Charles , he 'll dance with you . " Their host came up again , aware that he was the subject of the conversation . When David explained , he nodded and offered his arm to Janice . " Of course , an honor and a privilege , m ' dear . " " Thank you , Charles . " She placed her hand on the back of his wrist and he covered it formally with his other fingers . Music was pouring out of the adjoining ballroom as perhaps half of the people began to move in that direction . Already the first template of the pattern was forming , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colors of the men blending together until an observer from above would have seen only a kaleidoscopic explosion of constantly changing fragments of brilliance . Rolland drifted through the crowd , stopping for a few momentson the fringe of a crowd listening raptly to a minor senatorfrom Sumatra or someplace similar . The bombast was only a drone in David 's ears as he studied the faces of the audience , amused by the human capacity for total suspension of credibility . It was too bad that these were not the senator 's constituents ; his re-election would have been assured in a landslide.  |p34He  moved on , was caught for a few minutes by one of Letermcister'sassistants , a fellow hoping to make undercommissionerand therefore glad-handing any and all who seemed close to his superior . For some inexplicable reason he wanted to tell David about his family , and when Holland finally escaped he rushed to the buffet to refill his plate . Two women and a man drifted near , the most voluble expoundingon the near-religious ecstasy of her recent conversion to the Reformationist movement . The others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar group , which blended with the first . At last the excitable woman looked towardDavid , stabbing a finger . " You , sir  --  are n't you Dr. David Holland ? " Iie nodded . " You have the advantage of me , madam . " She ignored the parry . " You 're in charge of the program which supposedly is studying birth defects as caused by the naturalmother carrying the fetus to full term . " " Simplified , yes , that is one of the causes presently under in-vestigation . " He looked about , saw Janice staggering slightly as she came out of the ballroom . The man with her was a youngster , and he helped her find a chair , the two of them laughing at some privateamusement . He turned to snag drinks from a passing waiter , the robot cart obediently slowing until its dim-witted sensors decided that it was no longer wanted . " Is n't that the truth , Doctor . " " Mmm ? I beg your pardon , madam ? " He blinked , looking back at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the truth of the matter completely different , that in reality your program is devoted to investigations that have been forbidden , Doctor , by world compact for nearly three centuries ! Is n't it the truth , Dr. Holland , that far from being concerned with the problems of childbirth , you are creatingandroids ? " The forbidden word stabbed through the small audience , moving swiftly beyond to catch other ears . People were turningp35now , staring in open curiosity as those within earshot began to move closer . " Well , Doctor ? " she persisted . " Ca n't you answer  --  or is it that you do n't dare answer ? " Stunned by the woman 's words , Holland fumbled for an answer , stumbling over his own tongue . " That statement . . . is utterly preposterous , madam , " he managed finally . " Are you insinuating that the Commission of Science would be engaged in illegal research  --  more , that such research could continue , supported by public funds , for a periodof thirty years ? " He glanced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rescuehim . He did n't like dealing with strangers in the best of circumstances , and now he wished that Janice was here . She knew how to blunt the obvious wrath behind such a blatant attack . " You 're avoiding my question , Doctor . " " No , madam . " He shook his head . " Not avoiding  --  simply unable to countenance that it would even be asked . The answer is no , unequivocally and absolutely . My Project is not engaged in android research . " " Dr. Holland , I believe you are lying . " The challenge was cold , causing another ripple of excitement . David stared at her , perplexed ; what was the witch trying to do , provoke a duel ? " You will note , Doctor , " she added at that point , " that I have simply stated an opinion . I have not slandered you , sir . " At that she turned , moving off . Seconds later more than a dozen of the fascinated audience hurried to join her again , their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stared at David a moment , then moved off themselves . Feeling a touch of panic , Holland started toward his wife . Before he was more than halfway there Charles Letermeister appeared again , stopping to talk to Janice . They looked up as David arrived . " Well , here he is now , " said Janice . " With an empty plate , as usual . How many times have you refilled it this evening , David ? "  |p36He  ignored her jibe , setting the plate on the nearest empty chair . " Charles , we must talk now  --  and under the shield . Now ! " " Of course , David . We can go up to the President 's Table . Not even Senator Wiley can disturb us there . " Janice saw the expression on her husband 's face and immediatelystood . There was no question of her not accompanying them  --  she was as much the heart of the Project as her husband was its brain center . She caught his arm and started to steer him through the press , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , making her way through a thick group around Senator Wiley . He raised his hand , and the crowd parted ; they conversed , the senator nodding . He looked in their direction , saw the Hollands with the commissioner , and smiled . He came toward them , intercepting them before they could reach the door . " Ah , the Doctors Holland ! A pleasure , dear madam , dear sir . I 'm so glad to see you here tonight  --  but then , you would never miss an affair hosted by dear Charles , would you ? " " Good evening , Senator , " said Janice , taking the lead . " You 're looking well . " " Thank you , madam , " he said , smiling deeply . Wiley 's hair was completely white , his face seamed gently with the lines of age . On his features , the effect was one of an endowed wisdom . " Tell me , " he continued , " are you ready to receive my audi-tors ? " " We are always ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ records are open . " " Excellent , Doctor , excellent . Let 's see . . . " He glanced at his watch . " Twenty-two thirty , yes . The team should be arrivingat your quarters just about now . I do hope your night-duty technician is awake to admit them . " Holland stared , unblinking . " Now ? " " Yes , Doctor , quite probably at this very minute . I know that you were expecting the sweep next week , but I believe thatp37it 's best to come when not expected . Not that you have anything to hide , of course ... " He chuckled , deprecating his own words . " Well , I suppose you 'll want to return to your office now . I think I may just come along myself  --  may I offer you a lift in my car ? " Again stunned , Holland felt Janice 's fingers digging deep into the flesh of his arm . He covered her hand as he shook his head . " No , Senator . Thank you , but we would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is a fatal weakness , Doctor . " The senator wagged a long , bony finger . " I always impose . Good night . " Holland closed his eyes in pain as Wiley moved away . Then Charles touched his arm . " David , you have nothing to worry about  --  they ca n't find anything they should n't . Come  --  let 's go under the shield . " He shook his head again . " It 's too late , Charles . They alreadyknow. "  |p38On  the third day after his arrival at the temple the medic pronounced Clay fit to return to full duty . There was still a littletenderness in his joints , but the constant aching had left his bones and his strength had returned to nearly normal . " You 'll live , this time . " The medic returned his instruments to a much-scarred double-boundleather trunk in the corner of the chilly room ; the modern equipment seemed incongruously alien in the primitive setting . The only heat in the temple came from great open fireplaces , which were few in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The first could warm the front side while iciclesformed on the back , while the second might have been effective for warming beds if there were some acceptable-toKarylliaway of preventing the fire from consuming the furniture . Clay shivered as he adjusted his robes , glad to have even the native coverings . The weather had changed during the past forty-eight hours , a freezing wind now sweeping from the north , losing none of its fury as it crossed the open plains . Clay had thought winter was threatening , and then was informed that such aberrations were typical of the region . The wind could turn again at any moment , and there would be summer heat . The space station gathered weather information from a series of satellites , but even after fifty years the knowledge of the planet 's idiosyncrasies was insufficient to make prediction more than a series of wild guesses.  | " Thank you , " said Clay , standing . " I 'll try not to let it happena second time . " The medic grunted . " Your shield is working now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Snakes  --  at least , not with their sonics . " He snapped a huge padlock shut through the trunk 's iron hasp . The true locks , of course , were concealed within the construction , and any attempt to force the trunk by someone with no more than a Karyllian knowledge of locking systems would meet with instant disaster . Should more sophisticated knowledgebe applied , the trunk could protect itself to a point , and then would self-destruct . . . taking with it the assaulters . All of the Terran equipment was similarly protected , concealedwithin articles of native manufacture . There was surprisinglylittle in the way of technological support for the mission , however ; the agents made do wherever possible with Karyllian equipment . Thus the furnishings of the temple , and of the other Terran outposts on the planet , were strictly as the natives could best produce . Even the necessary communication equipment , to maintain contact with the space station and with the agents on detached duty , took up far less space than the medical locker . Those items of self-defense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extremity were carefully concealed within prosaic articles of clothing . At the moment Clay was not particularly armed , but his boots carried a supply of grenades  --  gas in the left , explosive in the right . Other nasties were concealed within his belt and its buckle . In the field , an agent was a walking arsenal  --  but woe unto the man who used his weaponry in a manner not later approvedby his superiors . Most of the Terrans on the planet were in the field , of course ; there were outposts of the temple in the larger cities , while a certain number of missionaries were traveling the highwaysin a constant movement that crisscrossed the continent . The number was limited , of course , and over-all a single remote village might not see a priest more often than at harvest time.  |p40Traveling  missionary was the role that Clay would shortly be playing , serving as Peter Stone 's private double agent . " I do n't know who I can trust , " Stone had said . " I only know that our ranks are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their recruiting , swearing all off-Earth adherentsto total secrecy . Yet they do have to recruit , and so there is some overt activity . " " I Tow many arc against you ? " asked Clay . Stone shrugged . " I ca n't even guess . The rot may completely undermine our structure here , it may be contained to a relative few . I have to pretend that I have no knowledge of their activitics  --  Ido n't dare force them into the open . Not yet . I fear they 'll break out sooner than we want in any event . " " Are you certain of any of their members ? " " I suspect everyone , Clay . " Stone forced a wry smile . " Even you . But I 'm staking my life on you . If you are against me , the game is lost now . " For a moment Clay said nothing . The man sitting across the table was as close to him as his own parents , the ties as strong as family blood . The silence quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Of course , I suspect some more than others  --  Martin , for one . " " He saved my life , " said Clay . " IIe does n't know who you are , Clay . " He shrugged . " I know Martin is trying to earn my confidence , he 's been working his way to me from the day I arrived . Of course , the man may only be a sycophant by nature , but I wish I could probe him  --  probe them all . " " There must be probe equipment on the station . " " And a strong possibility that the operator is a Reformationist , or at least a sympathizer . " " If things are so dangerous , should we be talking now ? Is this room secure ? They must know that you came to greet me as soon as I came to . " " This room is under my personal shield  --  I swept it myself just before I went to get you . Oh , there are spy bugs enough ,  |p41but  they do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They 'd need the power of a navy cruiser , at the least . " He stretched , easing the tension in his back . " As to my greetingyou , I 've made it my practice to meet every new man as soon as he comes to the temple . I also bring them here for an extensive personal interview ; most of them think it 's a terrible bore , telling the old man about their families back home and their ambitions . They think I 'm dotty , but it serves as an excellentcover . " He rubbed his neck . " I 'm tired , Clay  --  I 'm too old for field duty . I need a soft bed at night , somebody warm to hold on to . I hate the cold , the intrigue  --  when this affair is over I think I 'll retire . Assuming the option is left to me . " Clay had been carefully considering the various statements made by the other , all of which had been shocking in one degreeor another . It was a minute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , his surprise showing . " Retire ? You ? " How old was Peter Stone ? He did n't appear to be out of his seventies , but on the other hand , Clay could never remember him as being any younger . The facial lines had always been there , but the weariness was marked now in the way the eyes seemed to sag in their sockets , the constant droop to the corner of his mouth . " The Reformationists know that I am their enemy , " said Stone , ignoring Clay 's shocked question . " I 'm a clear target , and thus must walk carefully . I , on the other hand , ca n't even see them , do n't know their location , their military abilities , even the number of their forces . I jump at shadows , swing at the darkness . I work at night without benefit of moon or infraredscanners . Yet I must fight them , must stop them . I need your help . " Clay shrugged . " What can I do ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Martin . Talk to the man , Clay , get to know him . Be sympathetic with the Reformationistcause , be disdainful of the Guided Worlds policy . Bep42fruit ripened on the vine , ready to be plucked . If we are really lucky , he may try to proselytize you to the cause . " Clay remembered Martin 's conversation as they hurried through the streets of Ahd-Abbor , and now he repeated it for Stone 's benefit . The agent nodded . " Still not proof , but helpful . I want to know what Martin does away from the temple  --  if he tries to contact other agents , what he says to them . Even the way he treats the natives . A push is coming , Clay , I feel it . I want to know in advance when it is ready . " " A bloodbath , " said Clay . " Do you expect an invasion from Earth ? " " It 's possible , but I doubt it . The logistics would be terribly expensive , even if the Reformationists do manage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easier to subvert a single ship , or even a few men on it , and seed the planet with biologicals . It would be completely safe , and guarantee at least a 90 per cent wipe of the native population . In the cities , with other natural diseases released , the toll would be complete . " Clay shuddered . " It sounds so callous . I ca n't really believe that men would do that to anyone . " " It 's only one possibility , " said Stone . " They may have decided to exploit the local populations through slave labor programs . I do n't know , Clay ; that is the problem ! " Stone rose again , Clay following suit as the older man held out both hands . The youth clasped wrists with him , holding tight for a moment . " You 're my only weapon , Clay , " said Peter Stone . " I 'm going to use you to stir the hornet 's nest into activity . I hope that you do n't get stung too badly in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ join them ? " asked Clay . " What do I do ? " " Accept , of course . " Stone smiled . " With alacrity . " The mission was set . Clay and Martin would leave the next day at first light while the Terrans in the temple welcomed the rising sun . The dawn ceremony was the most important in thep43new religion , and with luck , there would be an increase of a score or so natives among the few hundred Karyllian converts to the off-world pantheon . Clay stood in a side passage looking out at the open space of the main temple now , wondering how many of the natives were there because of religious fervor and how many because of the generous soup kitchen operated by the agents . It made little difference whether they were interested in their stomachs or their souls , as long as their renunciation of the Sanctum was genuine . A large percentage , however , made both the dawn service with the Eternal Light and the twilight service with the Sanctum . There were half a dozen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bench before the main altar . The Eternal Light did not demand a generous measure of discomfortand genuine suffering with its worship . In turns , one priest at a time got up and chanted at a lectern . On another , lower bench at the side of the altar were three servitors , the assistants whose role Clay would assume when he accompanied Martin . There was a small constant movement across the floor of the temple , which was void of any furniture other than the altar benches . The high-arched ceiling caught the chanting voice of the priest and sent it echoing into every corner . The natives crossing the floor were intent on the kitchen at the far side ; some of them glanced toward the chanter , but few stopped to listen or went closer to the altar . Clay moved on , to the entrance , walking out to stand at the top of the steps . His attention was riveted as always on the nativeSanctum directly opposite ; he had come here a dozen times each day and during the evening to stare at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bulked little higher than the surrounding houses , but sheer massiveness gave it added stature . Like the Terran competition , the Sanctum was built of solid blocks of basalt . But the front of the building was sheathed with obsidian plates , each a man 's arm length in diameter . The plates had been polishedp44and burnished by generations of willing hands until now the stone shone as though alive . The central third of the temple was the portal , extending out over the square . The stones were fitted so close together that they seemed to be a single giant block which had been carved into the glowering , malignant head of a thrusting snake . The jaws gaped wide so that the worshipers passed between them , the fangs raised to strike , dripping slow drops of venom as servitorsfed them from within . The great drops were colored a poisonousyellow , and when the breeze blew across the square it carried the odor of ancient death . The effect of living malevolence was heightened by burning cauldrons set into the eye sockets ; at night they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he was unable to control a tremor in his gut . " Some researchers think it 's a Lost Race artifact . " Clay looked up in surprise ; Martin had come out behind him . " Do you believe in the Lost Race ? " " I believe in nothing , " said the other . " Even what I can see  --  it may all be nothing but a holograph . That 's why you never see me touching , Holland . I 'm afraid I might fall through . " " The temple is . .. astounding , " said Clay . " Frightening . There really are no words to describe it . " " It does appear to be the oldest structure on the planet , " said Martin . " Except for the citadel , of course . Now those searching for the Lost Race should start there , for my money . According to the Snakes , the Sanctum was created in one instantby the Lord of Outer Darkness . " Staring at it even in the light of midafternoon , Clay could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evening Stone called Clay and Martin together to his office for a final briefing , a perfunctory reminder of instructions and expectations . He clasped wrists with Clay no longer than with the other  --  but only the youth felt the strength of his grip . Clay spent a restless night mulling the morrow , not falling asleep until just a few hours before he was awakened by thep45same girl he had seen at his first awakening . Several times since he had tried to strike up a conversation with her , to no avail . lder smile was always ready , but she knew every twist and turn in the maze the Terrans had constructed in their temple to confuse and mystify the Karyllians . Clay tried to pursue her , but she ahvays managed to elude him before he had turned half a dozen corners . She was gone now as quickly as she had come , this time her hands empty ; Clay managed to wash in cold water , making his way to the common room to join Martin for breakfast . As the first rays of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the older agent made their way to the stables at the rear of the building . Their mounts were ready for them , native hakyar , cousins to the dak . To Clay , they resembled a crossing of the worst features of the Terran camel and horse , with all of the disgusting habits of the former and none of the attractivenessof the latter . The beasts were already saddled , high-backed things that crested a fatty hump , while the agents ' packs were tied down between their legs . The hakyar kneeled to permit mounting , swaying alarmingly as they rose to all fours again , Clay nearly losing his balance despite the safety strap about his middle . Martin hid a smile , kicking his mount into movement . The hakyar began to shamble out of the stable at a pace surprisingly fast as Clay followed suit ; they were neither running nor trotting , but they were certainly moving faster than a man could walk . At first it seemed that every step of the beast would dislodge Clay as they moved through the awakening city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to lean against the swaying motions , and he settled back against the saddle , thankfulthat the back was as high as a chair 's , even supporting his head . Before they were out of the city he was even dozing in his seat , although from time to time he had to shift the doublepointednative sword that was their most obvious armament into a position where the guard would stop digging into his ribs.  |p46The  hakyar rolled through the dusty plains , the early morningchill disappearing as the sun rose higher in the sky . The weather was obviously due for one of its unpredictable changes , and Clay knew that before noon he 'd regret the extra tunic he was wearing beneath his robes . It had seemed a good idea at the time , but already the cloth was too heavy for comfort . An hour away from the city and Ahd-Abbor had dwindled behind them to a low hulking mass that barely peaked above the horizon . An hour after that and it was gone completely . They were still in the capital district , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of traffic that moved toward the city . Twice they passed dal ( caravans , the dull creaturesslowing the hakyar in the manner of stupid herd animals on every planet . At first there was a constant stream of farm wagons , piled high with produce or skins and usually pulled by a hakyar . More than once , however , the farmer and his wife and even their oldest children were between the traces , laboring to move the product of their land to what they hoped would be a profitable market . The natives never looked up as they tugged at the heavy wooden two-wheeled carts . By the time the sun was at its zenith even the traffic was sparse , and now the road was much narrower , barely a single track that began to rise with the land . There was no longer room for the two men to ride abreast , Martin moving into the lead . " How much farther to the first village ? " called Clay , conscious of a growing hunger that was accompanied by a growing queasiness . He had seen Martin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now he followed suit , washing it down with cool water from his canteen . The filling food settled his stomach'sprotest . " It 's another three or four hours , " said Martin , not botheringto turn . " There 'll be a celebration for us tonight , Holland . " " Why ? " " The rurals actually like us , although they pay their tribute to the Snake tax collector when he comes through . But thisp47place is ours , heart and soul  --  they even cleaned out their Sanctumand turned it into a Temple of the Eternal Light . " " What sort of celebration ? " asked Clay , a moment later . " Traditional , as on every intelligent planet  --  plenty of wine , women , and song , all of the native sort , of course . Too much , really , particularly of the women . " " The Snakes let the villagers alone to join the temple ? " said Clay . " I thought they did n't like our competition . " " There is a witch-doctor type , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ willing to share in the goodies we bring . Some of these people really do n't take their religion too strong . " The countryside was actually becoming hilly , at least as compared to the plains , although they were moving parallel to the northern mountains . The hakyar crested a rise together , pausingthere before plunging down the much steeper grade on the other side . They had passed the last of the farms in the capital district nearly an hour back . There had been isolated habitations since , but they were self-contained , cut off from distant communication . There was scattered woodland now , and the few houses they did see were usually protected by thick trees . As they passed , Clay had the uncomfortable feeling that they were being watched , although there were no natives in sight and no signs of life in the huts . Until now the road had been hard-packed , but this soil was looser , of a more sandy composition . The hakyar 's footpads pluffed where they had plopped , although there was no discernibledifference in the ride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; they crested another steep hill and saw before them a shallow valley that was filled with a ragged series of wooded copses , the twisted needle-bearing trees conifers for the most part . Clay yawned , shifting his sword again . He glanced down at the doublepoints , the one really a hook to grab an opponent and pull him off balance . The other point was more of a cutting edge , excellent design for decapitation , according to the Master ofp48Arms back at Academy  --  providing the victim 's head was already on the block . Clay was dozing when Martin suddenly halted his beast , the second animal stopping as well by necessity . He sat up , looking around  --  and then saw the other man staring at the scene of a small but furious battle at the edge of the next woods . Four or five hakyar were circling a single rider , who was putting up a valiant but losing fight . " Bandits ! " said Martin , excited . " Are you game to play hero , Holland ? " Before Clay could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , forcing the hakyar into a run . Clay 's mount followed the lead of the other , both shifting into high gear that had Clay clutching wildly for the reins , his feet kickinghigher than his head . Martin plunged into the melee , his sword circling his head in great swoops . Clay was almost upon the trouble before he regainedhis balance and managed to draw his own weapon . The bandits turned from playing with their victim , shocked by the intrusion , as the agents ' swords tasted first blood . Clay was astonished when the man nearest him fell in a heap to be trampled by his own plunging mount . He stared dumbfoundedat the red stain coloring the first thirty centimeters of the slashing edge  --  then raised the sword to parry a tremendous sweep from another of the bandits . Instinct took control of his muscles as he forgot everything he had learned in weapons training about the fine point of the Karyllian two-pointed sword  --  indeed , about swordplay at all . He chopped at his attacker , then yanked the sword @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the other 's robe and pulling him along . The man tried to stab at Clay , but Martin 's slashing edge came down across his neck and he tumbled into the dust , severed arteries spouting blood although his head was still barely connected to his shoulders . Before Clay could let his eyes drop to follow the man another bandit was there ; he was forced to parry again , then drove the slashing point down into the other 's midriff , spilling his guts.  |p49Suddenly  the final two bandits were fleeing , leaving their fellows dead . The riderless hakyar had moved away from the battle as soon as their saddles lightened , and were now croppingthe grass at the side of the road . There were three bodies in the dust , all trampled now , although it made no difference to the souls that had once inhabited them . Clay wiped his mouth with the back of his hand , and then saw the lone Karyllian who had been trying to stave off the attackerslying beside the road . He untied his safety belt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one corner of his mind how the natives had managed to keep their seats without belts . Martin reached the victim first , kneeling to press two fingers against the native 's neck . " He 's alive , " he said , loosening the robes to check for sign of sword damage . " Correction  --  she 's all right . " " A woman ? " " None other . It 's obvious why she 's wearing the robes of a man  --  a woman riding alone would n't have made an hour out of the city . Assuming she came from there  --  she is wearing market cloth , not homespun . " Martin stretched the woman out into a more comfortable position as Clay came closer , then stood as the youth stared down at the face . Although it had been dark when he last saw its owner , he recognized it immediately . It was the little thief who had tried to steal his purse.  | " We ca n't talk here ! " The Commissioner of Science grabbed the Hollands by their elbows and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignored the glances of idle curiosity thrown their way , but David Holland was uncomfortably aware of the growing level of interest as they passed from the great room . They crossed the lobby to the drop shafts , but Letermeister steered them into a closed elevator instead . " Security , " he said . " The shafts do n't open onto the presidentiallevels , where the Table is located . " Letermeister seemed to relax a bit as the doors closed and the cage began to rise , although Holland felt uncomfortable in the completely enclosed space as he felt the surge of accelerationin his legs . He glanced at Janice , but she seemed unperturbedby the method of transport , and so he kept his silence . The elevator slowed , gravity reacting a second late to overcomethe energy of the rise as their organs shifted in strange fashion in their body cavities . The door opened , and they stepped out before the eyes of a naval guard , who stiffened to attention as he recognized the person of the commissioner . There was no one else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leading off it were closed . The walls were hung with a long row of naturalistic portraits . " The President 's suite is n't on this level , is it ? " asked Janice , interested despite the seriousness of their present situation . " No , no , " said Letermeister . " Just the Table , Here . " He stopped before a pair of doors that seemed no different than the others in the ranks and pressed his palm to the recog/nition plate . The door swung open , and he stood aside , letting the Hollands enter a plush conference room before him . Highbackedchairs surrounded a long wooden table in the exact centerof the room , while heavy draperies covered almost all of the four walls . There were no windows to the world outside , their footsteps hushed as they crossed the carpeting . " A silence generator , " said Letermeister , his voice sounding muted now that he was inside . He closed the doors and sealed them , then turned back to face them . " Now we 're under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cover this level and the President 's own suite . Now , what did Wiley say to make you think he knows about the android program ? " " It was n't Wiley himself , Charles . " He told them about the confrontation with the Reformationistwoman , Janice and Letermeister listening intently as he described her and those who had clustered about her . The commissionernodded . " Oh , it was Wiley , David , " he said when Holland finished . " It 's his mark , none other . The question now is how much do they really know . The Project is covered , is n't it ? What can the sweep uncover ? " Holland shrugged , sitting tiredly in a chair that molded itself to his form . His back was aching , but as he leaned back the robot sensors in the chair diagnosed the tension and began a gentle massaging action that was wonderfully relaxing . He sighed with momentary contentment . " On the surface , nothing , Charles . It depends on how far they are willing to dig . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the budget restrictions have meant . " " They 'll dig deep , " said the other . " If they have the scent of android , they 'll go as far as necessary . This will be the greatest publicity coup they could have asked  --  no , there 'll be no lack of willingness to pursue the inquiry . But can they prove their charges ? " " If they know exactly what to look for , certainly . " Holland looked at this wife , who still stood close to the corn/missioner . Letermeister unconsciously put out his arm , drawing her close , as Janice chewed on her lower lip  --  a sure sign that she was close to exploding . She felt the weight of the arm and looked up into Letermeister 's eyes , then down at her husband , as though to give him a reassurance that she did not herself feel . She moved to David 's side , sat down in the chair next to his . " Tell me the worst , " said Letermeister , hardly aware that she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ briefings have passed over my head , David  --  I 'm sure you were aware of the fact . " He smiled . " I make no pretenses as to my abilities . Like yourself , I am an administrator . Tell me exactly what I should expect in the way of accusations . Exactly what can they prove ? " " The blood tests are our most vulnerable point , " said Janice , taking over now that they had moved to the technology of the program . " If they compare the supposed donors with the actual children , the game is up . " " Were n't they compatible ? " Letermeister asked , incredulous . " That seems the very simplest precaution , one even I would have taken into consideration . " " Of course , " said Janice . " And the parents were compatible , always . However , the cost of developing blood types to match each of the parent-pairs was beyond our ability , Charles . It greatly simplified our work to have all of the children share the same blood grouping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the donors to the general type ? " " Not at the beginning , " said Holland , bitterly . " We did n't think of it then , " Janice explained . " Remember , Charles , thirty years ago there was no strong exogenetic drive , no Reformationists , no Humanity Firsters . We all knew that we were engaged in illegal research , but the risks simply did not seem that great . " " You 're right , " said the commissioner . " I 'm sorry , Janice . Sometimes it seems as though there never was a time before these last few years , never was a period of peace . Continue . " " For the past twelve years the matching has been compatiblep53in every possible way , but the first graduates of the program have no better than a statistical chance of matching blood type with the supposed parents . " " Twelve years , " mused Letermeister . " If they audit no fartherback , we may still be all right . " He had forgotten his own pessimism of a moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't stop there , " said Holland . " I tell you , they know ! Wiley is not going to be satisfied with any audit , Charles . He 's going to demand a complete examination of the history of the entire Project . " " Are you saying that we can do nothing ? " Holland slowly shook his head , looking at Janice . " I do n't see what , Charles . " The commissioner sighed , and there was a moment of shared silence as each was momentarily lost in thought . Then Letermeistershifted position . " Well , the carrousel is moving , and it seems as though we 're along for the ride . I suppose that we had best try to hold to our seats for as long as possible . However , I have the feeling that we 're about to be thrown off . " " It 's a little late to be concerned for our own skins , is n't it ? " asked Janice . She looked again at her husband . " We knew there would be tremendous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what would happen if word got out before the program succeeded . I 'm worried now about the children , what will happen to them . " " Yes , the rewards of the enterprise . " Letermeister nodded . " The future promise of the human race . Tell me , Janice  --  now that they 're writing us into the black pages of history 's ledger , do you still think the rewards worth the price we 've paid ? " " Always , " she said , softly , then repeated the word . " Always . " " You know Wiley , " said David . " What does he really want , apart from power ? What do you think his gang of hoodlums will demand from us ? " " Who can say ? " The commissioner shrugged . " Perhaps they 'll be lenient , now that you 've secured the election forp54them . Banishment , perhaps  --  perhaps no more than forced re-tirement . " Janice said the word they had all been dreading . " De-classification ? " " Not without a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , David , if they wish to bring charges . It depends on how much Wiley feels he needs to milk the affair . It is a possibility , yes . " " You 're protected , Charles , " said Janice . " There is nothing to tie you to the actual program . " " There is always guilt by association , " said the old man , showing his age . " It may be sufficient . Officially , of course , I shall be shocked at Wiley 's announcement of your traitorous activities . I will do everything I can to support you here at the Table , although it will be little enough , I fear . " He passed his hand across his forehead , then looked up , blinking as though in pain . Janice noticed the tiny shudder that passed over Letermeister 's spine , looked at her husband to see if David had seen it as well . He gave no sign that he had . " All we can do now is wait and hope , " said Letermeister . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old man blinked . " Yes . And pray , if that is your conviction . Perhaps an understanding intelligence is listening and can intervene . " He turned to the door , breaking the seal as David and Janice stood , standing aside to let them precede him into the corridor . He followed them to the elevator . The guard was still standing at rigid attention , the commissionerhaving failed to release him from his stance . Janice saw the poor fellow 's discomfort and tugged at Letermeister 's sleeve . " Mm ? " He followed her glance . " Oh yes . Relax , young man . Stand easy , whatever it is you do . " The guard relaxed , his grateful expression following Janice as the door closed , cutting off her view . They rose to the roof , where David reclaimed their wraps from the robot while Letermeistersummoned an aircar . When Holland turned around hep55saw that it was the commissioner 's official vehicle , humanchauffeured . The old man handed Janice into the car , then turned to clasp wrists with David @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Thank you , Charles , " said David . " We 'll need it , in great measure . " The car lifted , carrying them out across the city 's darkness . The street before government center was empty now , the demonstrationlong since ended . They passed in silence over the night , neither the man nor the woman wishing to express themselves in the company of the blue driver . Minutes later the car dropped again , into the secluded park district which housed the Project 's building . The grassy lawn before the steps of the building seemed crowded with parked aircars as the chauffeur got out to hand Janice and then David down to the ground . The man never spoke , and as Janice passed and looked into his eyes , his gaze was fixed on a point well beyond . Wiley 's senatorial limousine was one of the aircars , also attended by a blue . Two vehicles were marked with the insignia of the citizen 's channel , but there were at least three or four other cars as well . The ground lights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the actual number . But it seemed as though an invasion in force had been mounted against the Project . They hurried up the steps , Nathan moving out of the shadowsat the side of the door to greet them . The technician 's hair was tousled , as though he had been roused from sleep , and Janice remembered that he had the night watch this week . At all times one of the staff slept in the lab , in case of malfunction in any of the complex equipment supporting the thirty-six developinglives . Thirty-five now , since the one unit had dischargedits placenta yesterday , and as yet a new one had not been started . They stopped on the steps to talk to Nathan , the technician rubbing tension from his neck.  | " The first thing they asked for was the donor lists . " " Current ? " asked Janice . Nathan shook his head . " Complete . " Only a sinking feeling in his gut made David Holland realize that for a moment his hopes had been raised . Now he sighed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're looking for . " " How did they find out ? " the younger man demanded . " What source told them ? It must have been someone connected to the Project ! " Holland shrugged . " It could be anyone ; it does n't matter now . The Reformationists are drawing their sympathizers from every level of citizen , Nathan , and this can only help them grow stronger . For us , the damage has been done . All we can do is try to pick up the pieces . " They moved on into the building 's tiny lobby , which was filled to overcrowding now with half a dozen of Wiley 's hangers-on . The senator himself was standing in the center of the group , listening attentively to an apparently complicated question being asked by a reporter . Holland saw at least three cameramen , one poking his instrument into every corner of the lobby and opening any door that was not locked , as though the secrets of the Project were waiting to be discovered in a closet . " Ah , Dr. Holland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Wiley had spotted them , of course , and now he was waving a hand in their direction . One of the cameramen immediately swung around to focus on the new point of interest , responding to the tiny voice that spoke inside his left ear . He zoomed in on David and Janice as the reporter reluctantly turned from the senator . A look of distaste came over her face as she saw the directorof the Project . " You will forgive the upset , " said the senator , moving closer . " I 'm afraid the sherlocks have taken over your office , Doctor , but they 'll be moving out in the morning , as soon as their own librarian units can be brought in . I hope this does n't inconvenience you unduly , but perhaps you can find space for them . "  | " Of course , " said David , stiffly , determined to play the charadeaccording to the other 's rules . " I have nothing to hide , Senator . " " Nothing ? " The reporter captured his words , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ challenge . " Do you deny , Dr. Holland , the rumors that your Project has been engaged in forbidden research  --  thatindeed , it has been so engaged from the moment that it was established ? " Holland chose his words carefully . " I find it incredible that such accusations have been made . " " Then you claim that you are not engaged in android research ? " pressed the girl . " You say that you have not been constructingandroids in your laboratories ? " Each time she said the word the distaste returned to her expression . Holland forced a smile , turning slightly to look directly into the camera . " This is scarcely a factory . We are not making anything . At present we are engaged in carrying out several different studies into the entire problem of birth defects . I 'm sure that everyone listening knows the seriousness of this matter . Ever since the Bad Years the incidence of unviable mutation has been steadily increasing in natural childbirth . Our work here is of the utmost importance if we are ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " You are not making androids , then . " " We are researching human life . " " Human life  --  not artificial ? " " I 'm sure I do n't know what you mean by artificial life . Perhapsyou refer to the new techniques in robotic prosthesis , but that is scarcely something that interests us here . " The reporter switched tactics . " Your assistant has refused our information crew access to your laboratories , Dr. Holland . What is it that you are trying to conceal from the citizens of Earth ? " " Absolutely nothing , " said David , spreading his hands . " We have no secrets here , I assure you  --  apart from those natural se/crets that as yet have not surrendered to our research techniques . At this moment the staff is not here to answer your questions  --  after all , I am only the administrator . Please , come back tomorrow and we will show you anything and everything you want to see . " The reporter paused briefly , listening to her inner voice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standing by during her inquisition . His eyes twinkled , the smile apparently in permanentposition . The girl nodded , looked back to David . " Without limitation , Doctor ? " " No limits . We just ask that you limit the crowd so that nothing fragile is broken in the crush . " " Ten hundred hours , Doctor . We 'll have a full crew waiting . " Holland nodded his acquiescence . " We 'll be here first , to welcome you . " The girl turned away again , suddenly silent , obviously cut off from her audience . The senator cleared his throat , capturing the attention again . " Well , Doctor , everything here seems to be well in hand , I suppose I may as well run along home and get some sleep . It looks as though tomorrow will prove to be a busy day for all of us , so good night . " He bobbed his head once and then was gone , the lobby emptyingas his people and the reporter followed . Even the cameramengave off their snooping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of the pack . In a moment only the Hollands and Nathan remained . David stared toward the now-vacant entrance , most of the cars gone from the lawn . At least two remained , however , transportfor the team of sherlocks . He glanced toward his office , where the door was ajar , and saw someone at his desk , obviouslyworking hard . He wondered if they had searched his drawers and his personal files as yet . Not that they would find anything incriminating , but the invasion of his privacy rankled , made him feel sour.  | " Well . It 's started , David . We always knew that it would someday happen . " Janice lifted a hand , the fabric of her gown drifting gently with the movement . She seemed strangely out of place in the setting , dressed as usual in her favorite blue . She seemed more a courtesan , the creamy lines of her body visible in sudden surges as her dress shifted its hanging lines with each gesture . " But nothing terrible has happened yet , has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself nicely worked up for disaster , but they have n't done anything to us . To this point I must confess my disappointment . " Suddenly she sagged , Holland reaching out to grab her a moment before Nathan could react . Together they helped her to a leather sofa , David sitting beside her as she stretched out . " I 'm all right , " she said , forcing a smile . " But I am very tired , David . Call a car and take me home , please . " Letermeister 's sedan had vanished . David pushed into his own office , his look of rage enough to still the objection rising in the man behind his desk . As Holland stared the man slowly rose , then moved out of the way . Then he decided to step out of the room . Using the communicator , Holland summoned a private car , then went back to Janice . A few minutes later he supported her as they walked down the steps , her weight heavy against his arm . They entered the car and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the darkness covering the park area . Only David saw the security car that had been hovering overheadwhile they were inside , after following them from GovernmentCenter . Now it broke free to accompany them home.  |p60The  woman was not unattractive beneath the grime that coated her features , although it was necessary for Clay to look twice to be sure . Her hair was braided in the male fashion and wound tight into a knot on top of her head . Her body lines were not the lush fullness at the moment so popular on both Earth and Karyllia , but for all of their slimness promised a certaingrace and suppleness . Clay stifled his first exclamation as he recognized her ; he glanced sideways to see if the other agent had done the same . But Martin showed no sign of recognition as he stared in obvioussurprise at his prize package . Almost immediately the woman groaned , reaching up with the back of her hand to touch the queen-sized lump that had sprouted on her forehead . She yelped at the contact , her eyes flying open as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two agents standing over her . " Holy ... " Her first sound was a croak as she recognized Martin 's robes ; she squinted against the noon sun and shielded her eyes with her hand as she stared up at him . The older agent went to his beast and returned with his canteen , kneeling . He cupped water into his hand and let her drink from it , then stood again . " Well , madam ? " His voice was sardonic , showing none of the kindness of his actions . " What brings a woman alone to travel this road of bandits ? " " Ahhhhh ! Thank y ' , Holy , thank y ' ! " She bobbed her head , wiping her mouth before answering as she tried to sit up ; she could n't make it until Clay offered his hand for support . Wincing again , she pulled herself to her feet ,  |p61leaning  against the younger man a moment until she found her balance . Her weight was no more than a child 's  --  but her hand was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pain . She knew that Clay had recognized her . Her eyes , however , were on Martin as she made her explanation , her voice now softer than the first gasped word  --  and less grating than it had been during the street confrontation . " I travel to Turok 's village , Holy  --  home of my father 's house . I am a new widow , and my husband 's family are all dead in the last plague . Lacking a protector , his creditors seized all of his property , leaving me penniless . I have only what I could bear away from our house on my person before they came with the warders to throw me out . " Martin nodded in interest rather than sympathy . " It was enough to buy that miserable beast and this filthy robe , but no more . I thank y ' again , Holy . You saved my worthlesslife . But I 've nothing left with which to reward you . . . exceptm'self . " Martin waved a hand . " No reward is necessary , woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature and generous in deed . What is your name ? " " Garlan , Holy . " She hung her head as though in shame . " Your father  --  he still lives in the village ? " She shrugged , the gesture eloquent . " I do not know , Holy . But where else can I go ? I 'm not woman enough to attract a decent man . . . I 've been spurned by some almost as good as you . " " No doubt , " he said . He glanced at Clay , slipping into Standard . " A convincing story , quite possibly the truth . In any event we seem to be in for company on the last of our ride  --  we go to the same village . " That news brought Clay around to stare sharply at the woman again . He had been debating the advisability of telling the other man that this was not their first meeting with her , but now decided to hold his silence . But there were questions he would ask at the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considering her chosen occupation , he saw little reason to be gentle in pressing his queries . Was this second encounter only coincidence ? After the disclosuresof Peter Stone , Clay found it hard to give credence to the possibility . " Are you fit to travel ? " demanded Martin of the woman . She glanced toward the hakyar , and Clay thought that she winced . " I 'll keep m ' seat , Holy . " " Then let 's ride . I want to reach the village while we still have the Light to guide us . " He whistled and clapped his cupped hands , the hakyar lookingup . A repeat of the signal , and all of the beasts ambled toward them , including those of the dead bandits . A double handclap brought them to their knees so that the three could mount . Clay fastened his belt tightly , secretly pleased to see that the woman used one , too . It was satisfying to know that even a nativeneed not be expert in the handling of the treacherous balance . Then he reflected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had had little chance to practicethe male arts . Although she was fast enough when it came to cutting a purse . . . . What other proficiencies did she have with the thieves ' weaponry ? " What about them ? " he asked , indicating the corpses that were already attracting interested insects and small flesh eaters . " Leave them , " said Martin . " They died without the Light , so let Darkness claim them . " He kicked his beast into rising and then into moving out , once again taking the lead . The other two hakyar fell behind in single file , the native woman in the middle . Clay studied her without her knowledge as she leaned back in the saddle , her eyes closing against the brightness of the sun . Occasionally she winced as the pain jarred anew ; then her features relaxed as she fell into a doze , soothed by the rocking gait of her beast . After a time Clay did likewise.  |p63The  afternoon passed slowly , Clay wishing for the watch he had left on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Academy had set his subconscious clock to an accuracyas great . Garlan slept for more than an hour , coming awake instantly only a moment after Clay had opened his eyes . She blinked , staring ahead at Martin ; then looked around at Clay . She touched her beast and it slowed , dropping back to take up position beside Clay 's mount . " You show proficiency with the sword , sir . " It was not necessary to show him the same respect demanded by Martin 's priestly robes . " What is your name ? " Clay told her , and she shaped the sound , making it almost two syllables . " Clahyh ; a most peculiar name . You come not from Ahd-Abbor . Where is your home ? " " In the mountains , " he said , giving the simple explanation of every agent . " Urn . And that is where you joined up with the wearers of the white robes ? " She nodded . " There are many mountain men in their service . They must be very powerful in your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Light . " " And the Light serves them , " she said , the sarcasm suddenly biting . But as she said it she glanced ahead to see if Martin-aspriesthad heard . Her relief was obvious when he did not turn around . " You have no faith ? " asked Clay . " Faith enough in what my own hand can accomplish , " she returned , holding it up with muscle flexed . " You should visit the Temple of Eternal Light . " " Oh , I 've been there , " she replied . " I 've seen the free food for the belly and the free place out of the cold wind at night . When you 're hungry it 's a fair enough exchange , listenin ' to the sanctimony . " " You must admit that it 's more than the Sanctum will do . The priests of Darkness do nothing but bleed the populace , take their last crusts , take their houses when it suits them . What is right in that ? "  | " I never said anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ilim  --  puff-breast there . What is his name ? " When Clay repeated it , she shaped it with her tongue . " Mah-tan . Anotherman of the mountains , I suppose . " " As a fact , we come from the same valley . " " Why did you all leave ? Too cold for decent farming ? " " To serve the Light . " She glanced at him quickly , as though suspecting that he was pulling her leg ; then spat to the other side . A moment later she dug her heels into the sides of her hakyar , the beast shambling ahead to take up its center position in the file again . They had moved into hills high enough to make a noticeable change in the ambient air temperature , Clay 's heavy underclothingno longer so uncomfortable . Now they crested a barrenrock ridge , and saw below a long narrow valley , marked through the middle by the silver stripe of a stream . The valley was wooded at this end , but halfway along turned into open fields . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were in the forest , the trees tall and leafy , blocking the sun from the trail . The world seemed absolutely still except for the sound of the hakyar 's pads moving through the leaf mold that now covered the road . Clay kept glancing nervously to either side , a feeling of something impending tightening the muscles across his shoulders . There should have been the sound of insects , the call of birds , the chittering of small animals ; but there was nothing at all . He looked ahead , saw that both Garlan and Martin were alert . But the older agent did nothing to encourage his beast to move faster  --  and then Clay was sure he saw movement from the corner of his eye . He turned quickly , his hand going to his sword rather than to one of his concealed weapons in deference to the presence of the native woman . But there was nothing . He convinced himself that it had been an animal , and after a few hundred meters managed to relax slightly . There was no feeling of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , foreboding . After a time he felt clammy , andp65touched his forehead to find a cold sweat beading . He shivered as he wiped it away . He touched the sword again , recalling now the strange sensationthat had come over him as he used it to draw native blood . Awkward in appearance , it balanced well to his hand , the productof a Terran machine shop rather than a native forge . The steel was far stronger than any native manufacture , singing in his hand as it cut through air and flesh alike . It had been a good feeling , he realized now , feeling embarrassment at the touch of blood lust . And then they were coming out of the woods without incidentand moving through the cultivated fields . Another half hour brought them to the village , built on top of a knoll to take advantage of the natural drainage . A naked child playing in the dust saw them first ; its outcry brought the attention of several older children no more dressed , who immediately scattered to bring the word to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little hill Clay studied the half-hundred mud-walled , thatched-roofed huts that were scatteredacross the knoll in an arrangement without order . Then they were among the huts and surrounded by perhaps three times as many adults as there were houses . Martin brought the procession to a halt , looking around as Clay saw a blackened circle to one side , in the midst of which were half a dozen stubbled remains of more huts . Then the villageheadman was coming from his house , a graybeard who leaned heavily on his staff of office for support . He stumped through his people , pushing to where he could look up into Martin 's face . " Holy ? We have seen your face before . " " At last harvest , Turok . Does everything go well with your lands and your people ? " " The tax collector was here a ten-days or so ago , but he left us enough to plant new crops , perhaps even to feed our bellies through the winter . " Martin nodded . " It is good . Are we welcome ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the priests of the Eternal Light will always be welcome . " " It is good , " said Martin again , signaling his beast to kneel . Clay and Garlan followed suit , the two agents staggering slightly as they adjusted to solid ground again , fighting for balance . The youth noted with jealousy that the native woman had no problem . " We have brought one of your daughters with us , " said the older agent now , and Turok squinted , looking first at Clay . " Huh ? Who ? " IIe moved closer to Garlan , peering into her face . " She wears the robes of a city man  --  a woman ! I know her not . " " My father was Ilaslak , " said Garlan as the headman shook his head , obviously disgusted . " He sold me at the age of eight to a caravan master , who sold me again as a bride in AhdAbbor . Now my husband is dead . " " Haslak , huh ! " Turok shrugged . " Stupid man . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had no one to take care of him when he got sick . He 's long time dead . " He turned away , waving a limp hand . " She can stay while she 's with you , Holy . Now we will have feast tonight ! " He clapped his hands and a half-grown youth came running . Despite the great difference in age , the family resemblance was marked . " Tell Mura to give his house to the Holy , then take a strong young dak to Tessuk to butcher . " " Thank you , Turok , " said Martin . " You are a good man . " Turok grunted , " Only good , only good , " then shambled off , leaving the agents to ponder the meaning of his words . Clay watched him disappear , then glanced swiftly at Garlan . The native 's expression was unreadable , the news of her father'sdeath not even registering . Of course , she had been sold into slavery as a child , so there was no reason for her to have affection for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave no indicationthat her future seemed bleak . " What will happen to her now ? " he asked , slipping into Standard . Martin shrugged.  | " If she 's lucky , a bandit will capture her and make her a wife . Or a slave ; it makes little difference . " " And if unlucky ? " pressed the youth . " When her money runs out and she has no property left to barter for food , she 'll starve . " The thought was chilling . Clay watched as Garlan unloaded her hakyar of a meager pack and disappeared between two of the huts . Knowing her so briefly , he was willing to bet that she would never starve . Or end as a slave to some bandit chieftain . The youth returned from Turok 's errand . " Mura 's house is yours now , Holy , " he said . Martin nodded . " Help my servant with the baggage , boy . " He strode off without looking to see that his command was obeyed . Apparently Mura had been the hapless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enter the second-best hut on the knoll top . When Clay followed a moment later , he found the older agent stretched out on a bed of springy furcoveredboughs . " There 's vermin enough for both of us , Holland , but you may as well get used to it now . Your own stink will help some , for we strangers are n't as tasty to the bugs as the natives . Better prepare yourself for itching , though . " He sighed , kicking off his boots and closing his eyes . While Clay was still arranging their baggage a soft snore came from his drooping mouth . There were half a dozen of the beds scattered about the open interior of the hut , but nothing else in the way of furnishings . The floor was hard-packed dirt , with a fire pit in its center that Clay knew was used for heating only ; all cooking was done over the community fires in front of Turok 's hut . The stripped saplingsthat made up the framework of the buildings sprouted limb stubs in various positions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meager possessions of the villagers . The only light in the room was that which filtered through the door opening , although there were several small stone lamps of the same type Clay had seen in the temple resting about the floor . Most of them seemed filled with rancid fatp68that stank even now when they were not lit . There was a hole in the peak of the roof to let out the smoke of the fire ; rain was kept out by means of a flap that could be pulled over the hole . Choke or soak seemed to be the only alternatives . There was a snuffling noise outside the hut , spinning Clay around in sudden alert apprehension . The noise continued , following the curve of the wall , and then a shoat poked its snout through the door , sniffing the alien odor of the agents . It pushed in , curious . " Go on ! Scat ! " Clay picked up the nearest object , a half-woven sandal , and shied it at the animal . The shoat squealed , spinning around to bang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The walls shuddered , dislodging a shower of dust and straw from the cracks . " There 'll be others . " Clay spun , to see Martin with both eyes opened . The agent scratched beneath his arm . " This is probably his house  --  his , along with the rest of Mura 's livestock . At night they 'll be ambling home , so you 'll have to make the most of it . You can throw out the human inhabitantsof the place , but you ca n't dislodge the animals . " " I thought the place smelled like a stable . " " No  --  like a low-culture agricultural habitat . The separation of the two functions comes much higher on the cultural ladder . I 'll wager the temple is the only structure in Ahd-Abbor to keep p the animals the out of t1 community quarters . " He closed his eyes again , and almost immediately the soft snoring resumed . Clay finished his small task of housekeeping and looked longingly toward the other beds . After so many hours in the saddle his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cots looked far more comfortable than the pallet at the temple . Then Martin dug at another worrisome itch on his side , not opening his eyes . The older agent snorted , and turned on his side , presenting Clay with a view of his back . The youth opted against following his example and ducked out of the entrance . The adult population of the village had disappeared once thep69upset of the agents ' arrival was finished . Clay walked through several of the huts without seeing anyone other than the same naked child . Then he looked down the knoll into a field of ripened grain and saw a flash of dark color . A moment later there was another as several of the villagers moved through the stalks , tending to their roots . Clay stopped where he was to watch . Beyond the field was a wild orchard , and between the two wandered a small stream . The setting seemed ideally pastoral as he spotted several of the daks meandering between the fruit trees , eating falls from the ground . But this was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from ideal . Turok was a crippled graybeard , probably the oldest man in the village ; but Clay knew it was doubtful that Turok had seen as many as forty winters . Even discounting the astronomical infant mortality , the average life span for those who survived their fifth birthday was only twenty-seven Standard years . Karyllia in no way could be considered a paradise . The people were ill-housed , overworked , underfed  --  and oppressed by the priests of the Sanctum . The villagers made up 98 per cent of the planet 's population , drawn together in close clan relationships . As headman , Turok was both all-powerful and the abject slave of his fellows ; so long as he could protect them and feed them in time of famine , he could be absolute ruler . Let him fail once , however , even in a small way , and a blunt instrumentwould crush his skull to make way for a new Turok . Clay found it difficult at the moment to relate these deprived ciphers with the ancestors of his own race . Yet man on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towardthe stars . Human history on Earth was barely ten millenniaold , but in that time men had clawed their way from the first crude agricultural settlement to the mastery of stellar space . Karyllia was several thousand years along that same path already ... but left to themselves , would they break the planetbondsas the Earthmen had done ? Why force hundreds of gen/erations to suffer needlessly , when the older and wiser race could offer secret guidance that would short-cut those thousands of years that otherwise lay before them . Was there a universallaw proclaiming that each planet must experience the long path of error and suffering for itself , making the same mistakes , learning the lessons of a history already ancient on Earth ? It did n't seem right that such be the case . There were only three known intelligences in this region of the galaxy , all of them following parallel lines of evolution that had brought them at last to the form of man . It was staggering to the imaginationthat such be no more than coincidence . The men of one planet could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawing them together was unmistakableto any eye that could look and see . One superior intelligentform , taking shape everywhere that advanced life was possible . It was natural , it was the order of the universe . Clay could not understand the hatred of the Humanity Firsters , the force that claimed superiority for Earth simply becauseits branch had been fortunate enough to evolve to culture a few thousand years earlier than Karyllia and Locane . They were misguided zealots to be so blind . . . never realizing that he was a zealot himself . He stirred , an aching in his neck muscles telling him that he had been standing in one position too long . He rubbed his neck and swiveled his head several times to loosen the vertebrae , then interlaced his fingers to crack the knuckles . He knew from his weariness that it was time to follow Martin 's exampleand sleep away the remaining hours of the afternoon . He turned to retrace his path through the huts , a winding way that nearly doubled the distance to the house of the unfortunateMura . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Turok 's  --  and stopped . A small figure was slipping furtivelyalong the same path , taking shelter in the lee of each wall . Garlan started to glance back , and Clay flattened himselfp71against the nearest wall . When he looked cautiously around the curvature again , she was gone . IIe followed , catching sight of her again as she repeated the same sly movements . Then she was at the hut presently shared by the off-worlders , and ducking slightly to slip through the door . Something glinted in her hand ... something black , like the thieves ' knife she knew so well . . .  |p72The  demonstrations began the next morning , a score of pickets already in place when the Hollands arrived before 0730 . This was no spontaneous affair of homemade boards and hasty anger ; the Firsters were well prepared for the confrontation . Several of the signs contained crawl messages while at least two others featured fifteen-second animated cartoons . " How long have they been here , David ? " asked his wife . " It 's only the first morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I suppose . " He was relieved to see a security car parked on the lawn before the main entrance , and two guards standing before the door . Their company of last night was still trailing them , however , and as their aircar settled to the ground it took up the same hovering position as before . David wondered if Janice had seen it . The instant the door opened the sound washed over them from the pickets and their signs , deafening for such a limited group . Janice shuddered and hurried up the steps into the building as David followed , turning on the top step to look down at the protestors . " Monster makers ! " shouted one woman , shaking her fist . " No androids on Earth ! " boomed one of the signs . " No androids on Earth ! " " Criminals ! Declassification is too good for you ! " " Put ' em to death with their monsters ! " " Traitors ! " " No androids on Earth ! " Holland hurried through the door then , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He saw Nathan , waiting , along with his personal secretary , Jenny , here an hour before her usual time . " That has been going on since dawn , " said Nathan . " The day is early yet , " said David . " There 'll be more of them as soon as the cameras arrive . No androids on Earth '  --  do you suppose it 's all right to have them on other planets , even the moon ? " " Certainly not on the Guided Worlds , " said the technician , smiling weakly . " I think that one 's a mistake that will be caught as soon as someone in authority shows . Usually the key phrases are more carefully constructed . " " The sherlock in your office asked me to arrange quarters for a dozen auditors , David , " said Jenny . " The staff lounge is the only room big enough . The fellows have already cleared out the tables and the couches . " " I doubt that anyone will find much time to relax during the sweep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Waiting for you in the lab , " said Nathan . " Then we may as well go down and see what can be done to keep things running during this upset . " The crowd out front grew larger when several buses arrived , discharging hundreds of passengers and departing immediately , only to return again with another contingent as Senator Wiley 's limousine settled gracefully to the ground . By that time Holland had requested additional security guards , after fighting his way through a surly duty officer finally to reach the district commandant . He felt drained when he finally turned away from the communicator and closed his eyes , letting the robot sensors in his chair set a soft relaxing vibration . " Ah , Doctor ! Resting ? " He opened them to see the senator standing in the doorway , a cameraman crouched against the wall of the cramped office quarters to get both of them into his focus . As always , Wiley seemed pleased with the way things were going  --  and with himself.  | " Scarcely resting , sir . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No , I think I 'll be returning to my office now . After all , the duties of government do not stop merely because of one investigation . " He started to leave , turned back . " Oh , there is one thing , Doctor . My committee is scheduling a hearing on this matter in five days . You 'll be Commanded to appear , of course . In fact , your entire staff will be Commanded to appear . " With that he was gone , leaving Holland to stare moodily at the space he had occupied . The cameraman scurried away . That was the first day . The next days were little different . The crowd outside stabilizedat nearly a thousand . Three-quarters of the bodies were drones , swept from the nearest barracks and rewarded with an extra ration of happy juice . They showed their enthusiasm vocally , loud enough to penetrate the sound conditioning of the building . It was a low muted roar that frequently increased in volume , but never seemed to diminish . Auditors , reporters , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their duties in the lab . On the third day Nathan came to Holland early in the morning , worried . " David , ten eighty-three is showing signs of prematurity . " " Ilow old is she ? " Odd numbers in the series were female ; even , male . " Thirty-five weeks , four days , " replied the technician . " The computer recommends that we let her come to full term immediately . Several of the late-terms are showing signs of emotional distress , David . " " Did you run a trace on ten eighty-three ? " " Back to conception . The record shows double 0 balance all the way , so it is not the system . " As in natural-host birthing , the gestation period of the developingfetuses was approximately nine months ; but also as in natural patterns , the time was not exact ; it could vary by a normalthree to five days . Occasionally , however , a child wouldp75come to term in considerably less than normal . More rarely a fetus would cling to its artificial womb for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studies of the program was to try and determine the cause of such variations . To this moment there was a great deal of data but not a single conclusion as the computers kept demanding additional information . The following day Nathan was back with another problem . " David , the entire staff has been Commanded to appear at Wiley 's hearing  --  everyone ! We have no cadre to stay on watch over the life support systems , and right now it looks as though ten eighty-three is going to decide to be born right about the moment the gavel drops . " Holland sighed and tried to call the senator . He found himselfunable to penetrate the outermost barricade , a supercilious assistant demanding his name and identity number , as though he were not now familiar to every citizen on the planet . ' When David complied , the information was recorded in a manner implyingboth boredom and contempt . Ile put an urgent summons to Letermeister , the Commissionerof Science coming on the screen in a matter of minutes . " It 's still an official government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nature of Nathan 's plight . " At least , until the sledgehammers begin their smashing . " " Of course , David . Even a Senate committee can not force a halt to an official function before malfeasance has been proven . At the moment he has n't even filed formal charges . I 'll speak directly to the President if Wiley refuses my personal call . " " Janice heard a report that says he is favoring the Reformationists , " said Holland . " Nonsense ! " Letermeister 's outrage was the natural shield of a man who had spent his entire life in appointive service , as had the President . " What good would it do him , facing ten years mandatory retirement from public position when his term expires ? " The head of the government was a position largely ceremonial , as it had been for most of the past century . Occasionally ap76strong-willed man came to the office , however , and during his six-year term took effective control of the machinery that operatedevery aspect of the social structure of the planet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forces and the Navy . " Incidentally , " said Letermeister , " I too have been Commandedto appear . At my convenience , of course . Should I refuse , David ? " " Is there anything to gain or lose by taking either position ? " " I suppose not . " The commissioner sighed . " I really did not expect to retire so soon , David . I find the very thought of inactivityappalling . I 've no idea how I shall ever manage to sur-vive . " " Perhaps we can find mutual interests to stir our intellects , Charles . Unless I 'm reassigned to managing one of the southernsewage reclamation districts or desalination plants . That would be even worse . " " It is a possibility , " said Letermeister , soberly , ending the conversation . Not since the first confrontation with Wiley four days earlier had anyone connected with the Project mentioned the possibility of the ultimate penalty : Declassification . It was too frightening to contemplate . An altered Order of Commandment appeared the next day , permitting the necessary number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Holland noted that it was signed by a minor member of the committee , rather than by Wiley himself . He feared that it was an indication of the man 's pettiness . That night Janice produced a half-liter of brandy from the same mysterious hoard that guarded the coffee . They shared the intoxicant , although even with the alcohol filtering into his bloodstream David felt remarkably sober . They went to bed early and held each other close through the night . And then it was the day and the hour appointed for the hearingbefore Senator Wiley 's committee . It was a chill October morning when they reached the roof pavilion to find their aircaralready waiting . David shivered as he handed Janice intop77the car , the cold cutting into his mouth as he took a breath . And then the brief exposure to the elements was ended , the interior of the car conditioned to comfort level . At Government Center it was unnecessary to expose their skin during the transferto the building . Senate hearings were normally held in limited quarters , but the interest in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audience was surprisingly large , several hundred people ; David recognized many of them as being high in governmentservice . There were even a dozen other senators , evidence of the high-level interest in the proceedings . Every seat was filled , most of them with citizens above even yellow rank . The summoned witnesses were sequestered before their appearancesin a room apart . Letermeister was not among them , although there were several that David did not recognize . They were strangers to Janice and the staff as well , sitting apart from the pariahs of the Project . " Prosecution supporters , " Janice suggested . ' This is n't a trial , " said her husband , stiffly . " It 's only a formalenquiry . " " Please , darling . " Pained , she placed one hand over his . " Do n't belabor the obvious . " The preliminaries were concluding now , the last member of the panel settling into his place . Wiley was neither first nor last to arrive , smiling genially at his fellows and at the audience when he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aides and assistants , far more than accompanied any of the other senators . The focus switched to the table occupied by the Speaker for the Committee , a young man with legal training and political ambitions . He cleared his throat and stood , looking at the panel assembled , although he was obviously aware of the camerafollowing his every movement . " Senators . " He bobbed his head once in greeting ; there were nine on the panel , seven women and one other man besides Wiley . " We wish to begin these proceedings by laying groundworkfor the inquiries to follow . The subject is one of generalp78anathema to the citizens of Earth today as it has been histori-cally . " He paused for emphasis , aware that his audience was locked on every word . Just those with access to the citizen 's channel were watching , of course ; the only time the drone entertainmentswere interrupted was to address polemics keyed to emotionalresponses . " As a result , " continued the Speaker , " there is limited knowledge of the subject matter among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ witness Dr. Lathen Tarlfin , a geneticist , and an expert who can fill in the background for us before we proceed with this enquiry into the forbidden android research . " There was a stir through the audience as the outrageous word was finally mentioned , although David Holland and his staff had grown so used to the recorded pejorations of the hired demonstrators the past several days that the word had lost all shock value . In the Project itself , of course , the word was never mentioned , even obliquely . David tried to recall the last time it had been voiced , and decided that he had n't heard it since the day thirty years ago when Letermeister had tapped him to be administrator of the new Project . At the time Janice was brought in to be team leader , the positionheld by Nathan for the past three years . She had already established her reputation as a researcher into the medical aspectsof human mutation , and it was a simple matter for her to make the adjustment to the new focus . Working closely with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Project , most of them young and enthusiasticworkers chosen because they were not bound to the accepted areas of scientific development . Later most of them had advanced to other programs  --  apart from Janice and David Holland , only Letermeister remained as a link to the Project 's beginnings . Talented , the early staff had quickly risen through the ranks and colors of citizenship , earning positions of influence throughout the scientific community on Earth . Nathan had come in seven or eight years ago , quickly show/ing that he was as good as any of his predecessors . In the longtermprogram Holland had already tagged the younger man to be Janice 's successor , and eventually perhaps even his own . CertainlyNathan 's administrative abilities were as strong as his technician 's qualifications . David had not heard from most of the former Project workers in the years since their replacement . Now he wondered if perhaps Wiley 's source lay in that direction . Perhaps one of them had undergone a personality change , now sought only personal advancement or power . Janice 's testing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but in time anyonecould change . At the moment he hoped that his speculation was correct . He certainly did not want to think that the source could be someone still connected with the Project . Holland had few remaining illusions , but he wanted to think that he could trust the people that were as close to him as though they were his own family . As the Speaker called out the name one of the strangers in the witness room stood , adjusting his tunic and unconsciously running a hand over the back of his hair . Holland and the others watched with interest as a marshal opened the door and the witness walked out to be picked up by the camera , immediatelyappearing on the screen larger than life . He took the witnesschair and was sworn in , then crossed his knees and laced his fingers together . " Dr. Tarlfin , you are a geneticist connected with the ResearchInstitute for Geriatric Diseases ? " " Yes . " He nodded . " As such , Doctor , you are familiar with gene and chromosomqconstruction techniques ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basic to the study of human diseases . " " What exactly , Doctor , is an android ? " " Well . " He rubbed an ear , his professorial manner obvious as he prepared to lecture . " Classically , an android is a synthetic human being , created from chemicals . The term comes fromp80the Greek , androeides , meaning manlike . The term first gained wide circulation during the twentieth century , in fantastic ro-mances . " " Yes , well , that 's quite interesting , Doctor . As the term is understoodtoday , what is an android ? " The witness spread his hands , smiling . " A human being born without benefit of natural parents . " " I see . The human reproductive system is in no way in-volved ? " " None whatsoever . " " Well , then , how is an android brought to life ? " The legs shifted , crossed again . " It is a chemical process , involvingthe most extremely detailed genetic construction . Startingwith the basic nucleotides , you proceed to build the genes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is not necessary to actually duplicate the spermatozoa , although the early techniquesdid so . The male chromosomes can be directly applied to the ovum . The fertilized ovum is then raised in a host environmentthrough the normal period of gestation . " He smiled again . " This is of course a simplification of a most complicated process , but in essence it covers the process fol-lowed . " " Then successful androids have been created before ? " " Oh yes  --  during the twenty-first century . The most successfulexperiments were carried out in the Chinoamerican Coalitionbefore the Great Dictatorship was toppled , when it was feared that great armies of mindless automatons would overwhelmthe free world nations . " " Yes , well , we all know , Doctor , that further experiments into android creation were outlawed by the Compact . Is such an army possible  --  androids built to serve specialized functions only ? " " It is possible , yes . " " Thank you , Doctor . " The Speaker looked at the committee . " Are there any questions , Senators ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may an android be distinguishedfrom a person born naturally ? "  | " Well , it would be a difficult matter to establish . One possibilitywould be to do a gene comparison against the supposed true parents . If even one gene could be located in the offspring that could not be matched against either of the parent-pair , then the parenthood claim is false . " " But how can the android be identified as artificial ? " the woman insisted . " There is no way , madam . " " Then anyone could be android ? " " If the construction program could be proven to have been carried on over a long enough period , yes . " There was a moment 's silence as the impact of that statementsank in . Holland was watching Wiley 's reaction , the senatormaking a signal to another of the panel . That woman indicated a question and was given the floor . " Why would anyone consider an android desirable ? " Wiley nodded as the witness again shifted his position , quite obviously aware that he was the center @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfect conditions , apart from those of specialized uses , an android would be an ideal realized . The creation would suffer none of the failings of normal-horn humans , for there would be none of the genetic faults to which all normal people are heirs . He would be better in every way , in intelligence , in ability , in health . " " You are speaking of superman , " said the woman . " Of homo superior , certainly . It was recognized at the time of the Compact that normal births could never compete with the laboratory product . That is why androids were outlawed . " " Can androids breed true ? " asked another , without waiting for recognition . " I do n't know . I know of no reason why not , but it certainly would not be necessary . There is no need for parenthood when life can be created in the laboratory  --  or the factory . " " Are there any more questions , Senators ? " The Speaker looked at each in turn . " Thank you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. David Holland to the stand . "  |p82Janice  caught his hand again , squeezing hard . " David , it 's not too late to change your mind ... " He shook his head . " No . There 's no point to it . The whole story has to come out , and this is the best place for it to happen . They 'll have to listen . " He held to her fingers as he rose in answer to the marshal 's summons , Janice clinging as long as she could . Then he was moving through the door and onto the stage of the auditorium , blinking at the change in light level . One of the cameramen scurried close to focus on him as he walked to the witness stand and turned to face the Speaker . " Dr. Holland , you are aware that this is an official enquiry of the World Senate , and that you are presently within the field of equipment that is testing your emotional and physical reactionswith a 95 per cent probability , given your psychological profile and pathology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " The words came out in one long breath , leaving the Speaker to gulp in replacement air as David nodded his head . " I am . " " Then be seated , please . " He rubbed his thumb and forefinger against his chin for several seconds before fixing David with his stare . Even then he did not speak , the tension rising , until another twenty seconds had passed . " Dr. Holland , it has been said that you are now and have been for a period of many years engaged in illegal research into the production of androids . Is there any truth to that state-ment ? " " There are half-truths in the statement . " " Sir ? " The Speaker seemed astonished . " Half-truths ? What do you mean ? I ask you again , and directly  --  are you engaged in android research and construction ? " Holland swallowed , closing his eyes for the briefest of intervals . Then he looked straight at his inquisitor . " I am , sir . " Mere was instant bedlam throughout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear the worst but expectedp83him to lie his way out of it . Wiley was on his feet now , smiling sardonically as the uproar momentarily drowned out the rest of David 's statement . Holland was also on his feet , leaning forward to grip the rail around the witness box , shouting . " You must listen ! Listen to me ! No one has asked why we did it ! You must understand ! " The audience bedlam was easing considerably , but now Holland'swords were falling flat before they could even touch the ears of the committee members . Only the Speaker could hear him . " You may as well save your voice , Doctor . " He beckoned severalof the guards , and as soon as they were within the cone of the silence generator , said , " Arrest him . "  |p84The  hut swallowed the Karyllian woman , leaving Clay to cast quick glances around to see if anyone else was audience to what was happening . There was a raucous cry from elsewhere in the village as a tethered egg-layer reached the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clay could see one of the blue-skinned dogs lazing in the sun , snout upon its forepaws . Then the shoat came snuffling again between Mura 's house and its nearest neighbor . But there was no sign of human life nearer than the distant fields . He crossed the space between the huts in a crouching run , coming up against the wall of the hut to listen . After a few secondshe made out a soft air-gulping snore that could only be Martin . It came again at regular intervals ; to this point the other Earthman was all right . Clay bent to release a gas grenade from his heel , then thought better of it . He slipped the thumbnail grenade into his robes , his hand then moving to the hilt of the thieves ' blade taken from Garlan in the city . The Karyllian sword had been laid aside as soon as the agents ' baggage was moved into the hut . He went into a crouch again , preparing to rush through the door  --  when suddenly Garlan was coming out . For an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clay to throw his knife-bearing hand around her middle and lift her into the air . Instantly his arms were filled with forty kilos of fighting hellcatas the native woman raked at him with her nails , her heels raining hard-edged sandal blows to his shins and cracking hisp85kneecap . Clay yelped once in pain and fury as her elbows pummeledhis midriff repeatedly , and then she was trying to claw his eyes and attempting to sink her teeth into the unprotected hollow of his throat . The cords in his neck stood out as Clay gasped with the effort of trying to control the fury of the little female . Althoughhis mass was twice Garlan 's , her strength seemed nearly as great as his own as she continued to twist and turn in his grasp . All of his concentration held to keeping her still , his hand locked now about the wrist holding the knife as she cracked her head against his chin , bringing stars to his eyes . BeforeClay could recover she brought her foot up in a rear kick between his legs , almost reaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foot , crouching automatically as her fingers caught in his hair and yanked , pain stabbing all of the way through his braid and into a saucer-sized circle of the skin covering the top of his skull . Her fingers twined into the greasy strands and yanked again while she did her best to catch his nose in her teeth , ready to grind it into sausage . She missed , but her forehead banged painfully against his chin , driving his lower lip against his own teeth and bringing the taste of blood to his mouth . " Stop it ! " he hissed , still trying to use the strength of his arms to control her . It was a futile effort . " Pig ! " hissed Garlan in guttef dialect . " Off-world carrion scum ! For touching me , you 'll die ! " Seconds later the sense of her , words penetrated the concentrationand Clay went taut in surprise . He stared down at the native 's squirming head , wondering if he had heard wrong . But the meaning of her words was unmistakable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threw himself forward , putting as much energy into the action as he could . They fell together , Clay landing heavily atop the little native and knocking the breath from her . Then he planted one knee in her back , twisting her arm painfully . " Be still ! " he said , angry . " I 'll break it off ! "  |p86She  called him obscenities in dialects that were new to his ears , the meaning unmistakable by the tone , and made a tentativetry at twisting free . But she was securely pinned , and she subsided , recognizing a condition unchangeable by physical exertion . " Stop ! " warned Clay after the tirade had continued for the best part of a minute . " Stop the nonsense now ! " " Kill me ! " she retorted . " Go ahead , scum ! Kill me with my own knife like the dishonorable carrion you are ! " " A thief talks of honor ? " he said . " Thieving is an honorable profession  --  unlike yours , which skulks behind the robes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not very good at it . This makes twice now you 've been caught . What were you doing in the hut ? " As he said it , he glanced toward the entrance . The hanging over the door was hooked back to let in the daylight , and he could see Martin still stretched out on the bed . It seemed incrediblethat the uproar had not awakened the man , and now Clay was sure that the woman had killed him  --  but as he watched , Martin stretched and turned over to a new position , never opening his eyes . Now Clay realized that the entire battle had been carried out in whispers , his voice hoarse with the effort as each had tried not to arouse other interest . They had succeeded ; apart from the once-sleeping dog , which was now on its feet , watching them closely , none of the villagers had heard . The shoat had been frightened away , leaving the arena clear . Fortunately none of the other huts opened on this particular space . " Who are you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retorted the woman , " looking for something that belongs to me ! " " This ? " He held the knife in front of her eyes , which glittereddangerously . But she did not answer . Clay eased the pressure on her arm , shifting his weight so that his knee no longer pressed so heavily against her spine . " Give me your word there will be no more nonsense and I 'll let you up . "  |p87Garlan  bit her lip but again did not answer . After perhaps twenty seconds Clay released her and stood up . She looked more than ever like a small child as , after a few more seconds , she rolled over , rubbing the twisted wrist and flexing the injuredshoulder . She continued to stare up as the many pains she had inflicted on Clay 's body began to score their toll in separatelyidentifiable complaints . " Who are you ? " he asked again . " What are you doing here ? " " You have my name , " she said , wincing as she sat up . " I told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe  --  the rest of it , no . You 're no thief . " " I won my blade in the alleyways and marketplace ! " she said , insulted . " Fool ! " " Twice caught , you call me fool ? " Clay shook his head . " Unlessyou wanted to be caught ... " There was no answer to that , and he asked , " You took something else of value from me that night . Where is it ? " Garlan seemed puzzled by the charge , although the look was fleeting , her face quickly returning to impassiveness . She shook her head . " I took only your purse , which you had back fast enough . " " More , " he insisted , fumbling in his robes for the new filters that had been given him in Ahd-Abbor . The little electronic plugs were sheathed in magnetized metal that clung tightly together . " These . " Garlan stared at the plugs as Clay held them in his fingers , again shaking her head . " No , I took nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to search every pocket and fold ? On a dead man or a drunk , but not someone on his feet and moving , no matter how stupid he may be . " The taunt stung ; only Martin 's alertness had made Clay aware of his loss . He had never felt the woman 's fleeting fingers , had barely been conscious of the brushing contact that gave her opportunity . But it was obvious that lies and deceit were the normal pattern of existence to her ; he filed her denial under pending enquiries that could wait for their answers ; there were more important questions to be asked  | " What do you know of off-worlders ? " Again the blank look , although Clay could have sworn that a fleeting emotion had shone from her eyes . This time , though , she did not deny her knowledge as Clay grew impatient . " You spoke the word ! " he said , sharply . " I know curses in a dozen tongues , pig ! " she countered . " You misheard . I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a loathsome disease that will make your flesh rot and your fingers and toes and sex fall off ! " Clay surrendered , but returned to his first question . " What were you doing in the hut ? What were you looking for ? This time the truth ! " " I wanted my blade , " she said . " It is me . . . mine . My soul is locked in it . . . without it I die . If it breaks , except in honor , I die . " " That is why you are here ? " She nodded , eagerly . " Yes ! " " But how did you know we were coming this way ? " he asked , his voice suddenly softer in tone , even though they had been talking quietly . " You were waiting for us , not behind us . " " I followed you from Ahd-Abbor until I saw you take the western road . Once away from the settled country this is the first village . I cut across the fields and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except for the accursed bandits ! " Her story was plausible ; it was possible that she had skulked about the temple , looking for an opportunity to regain her weapon . There was no control over the natives who came to take advantage of the Light 's charity , and Clay 's movements had been in no way restricted . Dressed in nondescript and keeping her distance , Garlan could easily have passed for just another proselyte . Only the single misspoken word showed that she was something more , but how to get the truth from her , lacking the mind probe or drugs ? " Your soul , eh ? " Clay studied the knife , tossing it loosely in his hand . " I think I 'll keep it , woman  --  that way I 'll know exactly where you are . "  |p89He  was ready for her lunge , meeting her with a stiff arm that sent her tumbling backward in a tangled somersault . Before she could recover he had placed the blade across a small rock , his foot balanced across the arch . " Stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she came to her feet , ready to rush him again . " There 'll be no honor in this , Garlan ! " Hatred burned fierce in her eyes , but she stopped , time suspendedfor an instant , her hands out for the attack . Then she spat to one side and turned , moving swiftly between the huts . Clay was astonished by the sudden change , and by the time he retrieved the blade and slipped it within his robes to follow her , Garlan had disappeared . Clay stopped , frustrated ; she could have vanished into any of the huts , or slipped completely away from the village . He started to bend , to enter the nearest hut , then realized the foolishnessof the idea . Apart from disturbing the villagers , the outcry of his invasion would warn her long before he could come upon the right place , giving her plenty of opportunity to escape again . He returned to Mura 's hut to find Martin still sleeping soundly , his rest undisturbed . Shaking his head at the man 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door , securingall three ties on each side . He started to sit down on the nearest unoccupied bed , which was against the wall  --  and changed his mind in mid-squat . The hut walls were flimsy , no protection against the quick thrust of a sword . Instead , he moved to a cot that was more than a meter away from the wall , settling at last . Another mystery had been injected into an already confused situation : who was Garlan ? For a moment the idea that she might be another agent  --  or at least a Terran  --  had appealed to him , but examination now forced him to reject that conclusion . She must be a native of Karyllia ; a woman that small in stature could never have passed the entrance qualifications to be admitted to Academy . She could n't be more than 129 centimeters or so.  |p90Could  she somehow be an agent of the Reformationists ? If so , how could she have arrived on the planet ? This area was under routine surveillance and space flight was strictly controlled . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Guided Worlds . If on the other hand she had been recruited on the planet , then someone had broken the Compact . In Clay 's knowledge , such simply did not occur . The Compact was the strongest set of laws ever to have ruled Earth . There might be crimes against property and person , but the Compact was above such considerations . It was a moral force without the seedings of religion . The idea that it could be brokenwas unthinkable . He closed his eyes , resting , although sleep was still far away . And then Martin was touching his shoulder , shaking him awake . " Huh ? What  --  " Clay started to come off the bed , reaching for Garlan 's knife . Then he made out the older agent 's form in the gloom and relaxed , yawning and cracking his jaw . He did the same with his knuckles . He arched his back  --  and then became aware of a score or more places where his bedmates had decided to sample his flesh and his blood . He made a face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bringing out a dead something between thumb and forefinger . The agent made a face of his own , dropping it into the fire pit . " Time to be moving , Holland . " He indicated the roof hole , where dusk was gathering over the sky . " Our hosts will be ready to hoorah us as soon as the last light is gone . " Clay rubbed his chin , feeling the stubble of his beard , growingagain under hormone treatments now that he had stopped using depilatories . The natives shaved to a man , and a beardless man was unknown , quite probably would have been a pariah . Tomorrow he would have to hack again with the naked razor , a task he hated . He wished he could wash , but such was not to be unless they came upon a brook or lake , until they reached the temple in Des-Abbor , the seaport that was their last scheduled port of call on this mission . Oh , the natives knew enough to scrub thep91dirt from their faces and hands , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cults in the area . As Clay pulled on his boots , Martin dug for another visitor , disposing of it in the same manner as the last . " The thing I hate most is the delousing when we check into the nearest temple . You were bathed while you were unconscious , Holland , so you have no idea of the pleasures in store . " He started on the ties and by the time Clay joined him at the door Martin had the night flap pulled back . They went out to where a red glow could be seen dancing off the walls of the nearer huts , coming from the cooking pits . The strong odor of scorched meat came from the same direction , and Clay 's stomachflip-flopped , even though he had been aware of hunger since awakening . They made their way to the space before Turok 's hut , where the women of the village were preparing the feast . The dak was slowly turning on a spit , turned by a half-grown girl who had to strain to reach the handle when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been given to the handle when the beast was run through ; it was off balance just enough so that it was heaviest at that time and required a great deal of effort to turn . There were other , smaller spits over the fires as well ; the menu would not be limited to the single meat dish . Other girls were stirring great clay pots , the sweat from the fires drenching their simple shifts . The women bossed them constantly , barkingorders that frequently contradicted one another . Turok came out of his hut , grunting and scratching and still leaning heavily on his staff . He moved toward a circular arena a dozen meters across that had been scraped out in the dirt in the middle of the central space . A bed had been brought out for him , and now he lowered himself to it heavily , muttering curses at the weakness of his own body as he at last managed to cross his legs . Furs were brought out now and folded into pillows , then placed on the ground before either end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invitation , lowering himself inp92the same fashion as Turok but without complaint . Clay took the other . Despite his height advantage over the natives , when he looked up he was still a head lower than Turok . Other men of the village joined the circle now , sitting on the bare ground . Several of the women appeared with jugs , offered to Turok first . The headman swallowed deeply , then spat , spraying both Clay and Martin with his spittle . " Ahhhhhh ! The warm death is good tonight , Holy . It goes straight to the heart . " Clay found a jug pressed into his hands and immediately smelled sour beer . His stomach protested again , and for a moment he thought that he was going to be sick . But the immunizationsinjected while he was on the space station worked , and he forced himself to drink sparingly as he watched Martin draw as deeply as Turok . Once the first round of drinking was done , the jugs passed from neighbor to neighbor until drained , it was time to begin serving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obviously too important for the girls who had done the work of preparing the various plates . Great wooden trenchers were brought first to Turok , a tiny slice cut for him to gobble down and nod approvingly ; then the meat made the rounds . A woven grass plate was shoved into Clay 's hands , greasy from former uses . Before he could protest it was filled with dak and other unidentifiable flesh , and then a large roast tuber was plunked in the center of the mess . " Eat up , Holland ! " said Martin , jovially . He was already digginghis fingers into the mess . " This is Karyllian hospitality at its best ! " Clay ate slowly , every time his fingers became empty a jug of beer shoved into them from his right side . It was impolitic as well as impolite to pass without drinking , and so the beer continued to filter into his system , the level of alcohol in his bloodstreamgrowing so high that the immunization was unable to prevent intoxication . His head was beginning to buzz and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known intoxicants ,  |p93which  were frowned upon although not forbidden by the Compact . As the feast progressed there was entertainment , although it was difficult to make out the near-grown wrestlers who took the circle first with the only illumination that which came from the cooking fires . It was impossible for Clay to determine which player was which , although from their groans as they rolled about the circle they were entering into the spirit of the occasionwith the greatest of enthusiasms . Then one was jumping up , aiming a vicious kick at the other 's head , and presumably declared the winner . The other pulled himself to his feet and they staggered from the circle together , the audience hooting with appreciation . The center of the ring was taken next by a pair of sword wielders , Clay at first interested as the native blades slashed about with alarming swiftness . The metal caught the fire glow , gleaming dully red . Then he saw blood spout from a severed arteryand knew that this was no game . He looked at Martin , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started to say something to him , but the injured man lost his footing at that moment , tumbling forward to end nearly in Clay 's lap . The victor helped him from the circle , and that section of the entertainment was finished . Now several of the men in the circle were getting up to leave momentarily , an idea that appealed to Clay after the quantity of beer he had drunk . He got up to follow , but saw them returning , having left for a reason different from the one he supposed . They had gone no farther than the ring of women who were standing a dozen meters behind the men , and now each was dragging a giggling conquest back to the circle . " All , yes . " Martin wiped his mouth as he spoke in Standard , his humor high . " We 've had what passes for the wine , Holland , and what passes for the song . Now it 's time for the native version of , you must forgive the expression , women . " " Have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This had never been mentioned in the tapes at Academy . " None that we would recognize . Choose , lad  --  but take myp94advice and try to find one with a really repulsive stink . The chances are her bug infestation will be less than that of her mates . " " Not me ! Oh no ! " " You must , or Turok will be grievously insulted . " " What about you ? " he countered . " You 're not picking . " " Ah , but I 'm exempt . While I was here last year I managed to convince good Turok that certain priests are sworn to special vows . They can lie with women only in the great temple and only at the most propitious times . The old fellow is impressed by any priesthood ; he believed me . " Although the term would not have been familiar to him , Clay 's education was highly Puritan in its morals . He stared at the mating going on about him , wondering in panic how he could escape . Martin was chuckling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offered no help . Then a small figure was standing beside him , slight in build but attractive in a gown that certainly had never seen loom in this village . It was city stuff , fine and expensive , clinging to the lines of her figure . Her fine hair had been combed out until it seemed to billow in the soft light of the sinking fires , floating about her shoulders and half covering her arms . Her hand touched his shoulder , and she smiled  --  and with further shock , Clay recognized Garlan . After a few seconds he scrambled to his feet , tongue-tied . She laughed , her voice musically soft as she reached up to touch his face . There was none of the harsh thief now , nor of the hellcat of this afternoon . Clay stared down at her sharply delineated cheekbones , saw the way nostrils cleansed of grime flared over full red lips . There was a gentle odor as well , perfumerather than unwashed body , the scent tantalizingly familiaryet almost exotic in its strangeness . " Who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exertingcruel pressure with his thumbs . The native woman wincedbut did not try to draw away as her perfume seemed to exercisea hypnotic effect on the youth . Gradually the pressure relaxed . " I am Garlan , " she said . " Daughter of Ilaslak of Turok 's vil/Inc , member of the Thieves ' Guild , exile from my home . I am a woman alone in the world who must make her way as best she can . " " No . " Clay shook his head , conscious that this woman was beautiful even if alien . " You 're more , much more  --  that dress ! Where did you get it ? " " It was one of the few miserable pieces I managed to rescue from the greed of my dead husband 's creditors . " " No street woman nor merchant 's wife ever owned a dress like that ! It belongs to a courtesan , to the consort of a war lord . What are you , Garlan ? " Her words had been whispered , heard no farther than Clay 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the effects of the beer had finally overcome him . He leaned back against Turok 's bed , his hands hanging straight at his sides and his head droopingwhile a snore issued from his throat . " I am Garlan , " she said again , " woman of Karyllia . I am going to save your life , Earthman ... "  |p96David  Holland stared at the approaching security guards , tears of frustration stinging the corners of his eyes as his words fell unheard a scant meter away . This was not the way it was supposed to be  --  by the Compact they even now claimed to honor , they were supposed to hear him out , listen to why he had committed his supposed great crime . Janice had been right ; she said they would n't listen , and they were following her predicted pattern to the final degree . The guards were at either side of him now , one clamping something about his wrist  --  and then a shock stabbed through his body , causing his hair to stand with electricity , his muscles to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a second , but when it left he felt as though he were encased in ice . The guard tugged at his wrist and he moved out of the box in movements that were stiff and jerky . Holland tried to turn his head , intending to look toward Wiley , but independent movement was impossible . His body was completely under the control of the guard and whatever the instrument was that was attached to his wrist . From the corner of his eye he saw that several of the senators were standing , but Wiley was n't in his field of vision . Then even that much was gone as he reached a door and was led out . As the door started to close behind him he thought frantically of his wife , still in the witness room . What were they doing to her , to the others ? The next twenty minutes were nightmare as he continued under the control of the guard 's device . They moved through endless corridors and elevators , and finally Holland was pushedp97through a door . There the device was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control . Before he could recover , he heard the door click locked behind him . He spun around , staggering still as his body adjusted to free control again , to see an absolutely blank door panel , devoid of any control mechanism . A sudden shout made him spin to his right : a small screen built into the wall was showing the public entertainment channel , at the moment a gory scene of battle with slashing swords and great splashes of blood spattering through the air . Wincing , he moved forward to silence the screen ... but like the door , there was no available control system . He was in a tiny room . A narrow bed occupied most of the room , a single chair locked to the floor at its foot . A table shelf was partially slid into the wall below the screen , while a single narrow locker , also built-in , offered storage space . Opposite the room 's door was a small ' fresher , a single shower stall that could be entered only by sidling around the stool . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stool . The room was quite the smallest Holland had ever seen , although it was as large as any blue tubby . Even married blues did not receive double the space allotment , although their quarters had to be large enough to contain a bed big enough for two and an extra chair and locker . David had visited the quarters of his technicians several times over the years  --  they at least had room enough to turn around in , and shelf space for prized personal possessions . This was obviously a detention center , considering the lack of controls on door and screen . He winced as he glanced at the latter again , the noise pounding in waves of increasing passion calculated to stimulate the emotions of the watching drones and blues . It was succeeding only in giving him a headache . " Shut it off , please ! " he begged , knowing that someone must be listening . But the request was ignored . The screen was mounted flush with the wall , making it impossible to cover with his tunic . He sank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was a vacant sensation in the back of his throat as he lay back , the bed adjusting to him ; it read the tensionin his body and began a gentle massage as Holland felt very much like crying . He knew the response was anything but mature , but at the moment maturity seemed an attribute withoutvalue . Where was Janice ? Nathan ? The rest of the staff ? What was happening at the Project ? Was his the only arrest , or had they all been taken ? There were no answers to any of the questions without contact with the outside world . And at this moment he was sealed off completely from such contact . He closed his eyes , recognizingthat excitement was useless , and that questioning the unknowable was pointless . Sleep did not come . His eyes opened ; his thoughts were too chaotic to permit relaxation and none of the control techniques he tried were effective . The sound of the public channel nagged incessantly at his ear , even when he turned on his side away from it . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in undiminished volume . There was no way to escape the onslaught , lacking the filters that had been designed for the agents on Karyllia as protection against the sonics of the native religion . Karyllia . He thought of his son for the first time in days . Clay must be in action by now  --  how much had Peter Stone found it necessary to reveal to the boy ? The knowledge of the race 's deterioration was held to only a few at the highest level , but now that Wiley had forced the issue it would have to be made public . The crisis was real , was the reason for the Project , could no longer be hidden . Perhaps it should never have been hidden . Time passed with excruciating slowness as Holland waited for something , anything , to happen . The entertainments on the public channel shifted periodically , timed to the normal attentionspan of the intended audience . Unable to find release in the wanted sleep , he at last began to watch , wondering what minds had created this confusion in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be shell-hardened to normal sensitivities . It was obvious that most of the actors were drawn from the ranks of the blue , although their work earned them special privileges that gave them position just below the yellow . Holland consulted his watch regularly , saw that most of the entertainments lasted no more than thirty minutes . It was two hours past noon ; had they forgotten him entirely ? Despite his dark mood , his body knew hunger . There was an interruption then , the door sliding open to reveala gloomy-faced young man no older than the Speaker of the Committee who had assured his political future this morning . The man carried a portfolio , which he placed in his lap as he took the single chair in the room , the door sliding shut behind him . There had been no sign of anyone else in the corridoroutside . " I am Pel Maslan , Dr. Holland . I have been appointed your public defender . " Holland sat up . " My wife ? " he demanded . Maslan shrugged . " I really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hearing this morning , Doctor . Is your wife a fellow conspirator ? " " No ! " He tried to control his anger . " Neither of us are conspirators , sir  --  not in the sense you mean . " " Of course . " His mouth pursed . " However , she has been associated with you for a long time , has she not ? " Holland nodded . " She has . " " The public charges against you have just been read  --  I have a copy here for you . " He opened his portfolio and took out a sheaf of legal documents . Holland accepted them dully , glancingbriefly at the first page . " These were prepared quickly enough . " Once more came the other 's shrug . " I really have nothing to do with those matters , Doctor . " It was obvious that he was not pleased with his position . There was no glory on this side of the Holland affair . Holland stared at the man a moment , the silence growingp100awkward , until at last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It is not necessary that there be a trial , " he said . " Further publicity may be avoided , further unpleasantness , if you simply plead guilty to the charges as broadcast . " " And if I do ? " " Well , the matter ends there , of course . The decision will be made on the basis of your plea . " " And what happens to me then ? " Maslan spread his hands . " That depends on the tribune , of course . I 'm sure you were aware of the penalties when you began your illegal research . " The defender obviously was avoiding unpleasantness by refusing to give them voice . Holland felt a sour humor convulse his stomach as he stared the man into fidgeting with the handleof the portfolio . At last he shook his head . " I want my story told . I want the citizens to understand why I did what I did  --  why it was necessary for the Project to follow the paths that carried us into android research . I still have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Very well , Dr. Holland . " The portfolio produced a recorder . " Please state all relevant facts so that I may prepare an official plea for clemency . " Holland gathered his thoughts for a moment , eyes closed in pain as he recalled the circumstances which led Charles Letermeisterthirty years ago to establish the android project in violation of all of Earth 's laws . The matter seemed so serious and yet so frightening in its public implications that the President of the time agreed that secrecy was necessary . Even then Janice had argued that the citizens should be told what was happening , but she was overruled by the psychometricians opted to the original study . The government expert had been wrong in making it sound to those listening this morning as though android construction was an easy matter . Many difficulties made it seem as though they were following blind trails , perhaps purposely laid by the world 's leaders at the time when androids were first outlawed.  |p101Yet  androids had been successfully created then , and the laws of nature had not changed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right trail , and another three before the first android infant was born a success . There had been many failures during those three years , and many others that were at best partial successes , before a completely viable child was produced with every evidence of adherence to the ideal . In the twenty years since there had been other failures , although the rate had grown smaller over the course as they learned the mistakes they had made in the beginning , and knew as much what errors to avoid . No more than io per cent of the children tested out ideal , although there was none of the recession of intelligence in the android births that could be charted in human creches over the same period of time . Whateverrecessive gene was responsible for the deterioration had not been duplicated in the android banks . As yet the oldest of the androids were still years away from the social norm or marriage , but according to every test Holland'stechnicians had been able to devise , they could breed true  --  they would breed true . The problem now was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ androids born  --  from one a week to one a minute . Letermeister had been planningthe finances of the stepped-up need .. . The problem now .. . After perhaps twenty minutes Holland 's words ran dry , and his mouth closed ; he stared at the young defender as though expectingsome visible transformation with an understanding of the crisis facing the race . He was disappointed ; Maslan blinked once , and stirred . " Is that all , Doctor ? " " Is that all ? " repeated Holland , incredulous . " Have n't you been listening ? Have n't you heard a word I said ? " " Of course . It is a very pretty fantasy , Doctor , but of course you do n't really expect anyone to believe such a paranoid nightmare . The race most certainly is not regressing  --  look at the progress we are making in the stars . Historically the trend ofp102the human race is ever upward . Society has most certainly not come to a standstill , is most certainly not deterioriating around us now . Not unless you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But it is ! " he insisted . " You ca n't see it from the middle , any more than the Romans of the fifth , sixth , or seventh centuriescould see that darkness was falling about them . But it happened  --  it is happening , now ! " Well , I shall have to be one with the Romans , Doctor . " Maslan stood . " I shall come again as soon as I hear the results of the plea , although I fear it will do little good to prepare for this trial . Public anger is very great , and any judge who might be assigned has to be swayed by the emotionalism of the people . Still , it will be an exercise in technique , if nothing more . Good day , Doctor . " " Wait ! " said David , coming to his feet . " I must see the Commissioner of Science ! " " I will certainly relay your request . " The door opened then , proving that the room was under constant monitoring , and Maslan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could move toward it , and before he caught more than a glimpse of the bare corridor wall opposite . He sank down onto the bed again , lost in his own gloom . Some time later the door slid open again , without warning , a blue guard standing there with a robot waiter . The man lifted a tray from the receptacle , there not being room enough for the waiter to maneuver around the furniture . " Pull out the table , happy ! " the guard ordered . " Whatcha waitin ' for ? " Holland did as he was commanded , forced once again to stare at the screen . As the guard set the tray before him , he asked , " Ca n't you shut that thing off ? Or at least turn it to the citizen 's channel ? " " Ca n't do that , happy , " the blue said , cheerfully , dropping into the chair . It was obvious that he was going to keep the prisoner company during the meal . " Never shuts off , goes all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's wunna my fav'rites ! "  |p103As  Holland worked at his ration he was forced to listen to a running story line of the entertainment . " Y'see , Doc Arkohey , he 's a doe like you ! Well , anyways , he has this thing for pretty slicks , but they got ta be young , see . He pretends he loves em , but what he really wants to do is take ' em home an ' do em in so 's he c'n cook ' em ! He 's wunna them watcha call cannobballs , an ' he likes to eat pretty slicks best of all . There , lie 's doin ' it t ' her now ! Yeah , slice that slickie , make her scream , Doc ! Hey , I wun n't min ' tastin ' some o ' that myself , huh ! " Holland looked at his plate and felt suddenly ill ; he pushed it away . By lowering his eyes he could avoid the scene on the screen , but there was no way to cut out the sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scream was still dying away . " Do n't they ever , ah , catch the villain ? " he asked . " Naw ! What they wan na do that for ? All the fun 's in watchin ' im slice those slickies . They catch of Arko there wo n't be no more fun left . " He spotted the abandoned tray and unwound himself from about the chair , not too disappointed that the entertainment was over for the moment . There would always be another episodeand another dismemberment to cheer him up again . Once again Holland was alone , the questions he had intended to ask the guard driven out by the grisly horror on the screen . Another just as bloody had taken its place , however , and he lay down on the bed again , turning toward the wall so that he at least would n't have to look at what was transpiring on the screen . The sound was bad enough . With only his thoughts to keep him company , the evening passed as painfully slow as the afternoon , his hunger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had not finished his meal . It would undoubtedly be a long time until breakfast . He was at last at the point of dozing off when the door clicked again , and he turned over to see Letermeister . " Charles ! " He scrambled to his feet , hands out to greet his friend . " It took you long enough to get here . " Letermeister touched hands lightly , dropping into the chairp104as though his age had suddenly caught up with him . His eyes closed in momentary pain . " The President asked for my resignation tonight , David . He agreed to let me withhold it a few hours , to make this my last official function . He can wait no longer , however ; the pressure from the Reformationists is the greatest ever . Wiley is demandingthat the President call a general election . " " Janice ? Where is she ? " " Arrested . In a room a few doors down . " " Nathan ? The others ? " " All arrested , David . " He sighed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Everything is sacked . " " The fetuses ? The embryos ? " " Aborted , all of them . There were no medical technicians on hand , not that it would have done any good . The late-terms that could survive were ... murdered . " Holland slumped , wincing with pain ; thirty-five lives lost . Some would not have survived in any circumstance , because there had recently been problems that caused Janice 's suggestionto tear down the network and rebuild it from scratch . ' They had been trying to eliminate the last possibilities of error in the system , planning for the day when they could move into full-scale activity . All dead . He felt every loss completely . " I 'll be seeing Janice when I leave you , David . I 'll see them all . It 's the least I can do ... the last I can do . " " Do n't tell her about the destruction , " said Holland . " Keep that much from her . " Letermeister nodded . " There 's a witch hunt going on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ androids , uncover their hiding places . " " Most of them are only children . They do n't know that they are android . " " It makes no difference . It 's mostly the blues , so far , although they 've swept the barracks in a few of the districts , turning the drones loose as well . They have the smell of blood ... several have been caught already , those they could provep105came from the Project . The Firsters have the list and they 've been broadcasting it ever since the morning . " " Thank Wiley for that , I suppose . " Letermeister sat straighter . " Wiley is only a tool , David . The forces are greater , perhaps even natural . He thinks he sees the way to quick power , but he is really only responding to the demands of the populace . " " They do n't want to hear the truth . " He told the other about the visit from the defender . Letermeister nodded . " The world is in for another time of madness , David @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with us again . I at least can retire . .. " It was not necessary to finish the thought . The commissioner stood , offered his hands . " I 'm very sorry that I brought you into this , David . I wo n't see you again after this , I 'm afraid . So this must be good-by . " " Good  --  " David bit his lip , unable to finish the word . " Will I see Janice at the trial ? " Letermeister shook his head . " No , David . You 'll never see her again . " He turned to face the door , which quickly opened . Holland watched as his closest friend stepped out without looking back and started away . The panel closed quickly , leaving Holland with the noise of the public channel and his own private grief . But not for himself ; his grief was for the unborn children murdered this clay , for the others who would be destroyed while still in childhood . It was a terrible burden , one that weighed most heavily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . From the beginning the possibility of discovery before they were ready had been known and planned for . As many of the infants as possible were smuggledinto life , their identities buried deep in false records , their lives swapped for natural stillbirths without the knowledge of the supposed parents . There were several hundred of them by now  --  not enough ; not by any means enough . But the time of insanity would pass again , would have to pass again , and their chance would come.  |p106He  spent a restless night , sleeping in fitful dozes that left him heavy with fatigue when a blue brought breakfast in the morning . Despite his hunger , he picked listlessly at his food , then followed the guard 's advice and used the facilities of the ' fresher . Apparently it was considered essential for prisoners to be clean for their trials . The public defender returned an hour later , Pel Maslan still holding to his portfolio . He did not bother to sit down . " They are ready for your trial , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Holland stood , shrugging . " Then there 's no real point to this affair , is there ? " " You may still plead guilty , " said Maslan . " But it wo n't affect the results . " The other shook his head . " Then I 'll make them earn their citizens ' allowance by doing the whole job . " Two of the guards appeared at the door and Maslan stepped out . Holland started to follow , when one of the guards approachedwith a wrist device . He tried to fend the man off . " That is n't necessary . " " Regulations , happy , " replied the guard , snapping the controlin place . He activated it , and Holland was dragged forth , once again an automaton . The trial was to be held on this floor , which saved him a measure of agony ; when the control was removed he found himself standing in a witness box in a small court , the tribune already behind the bench . The only other person in the room was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down from nearsighted eyes . " You have heard the charges as broadcast . How do you plead ? " " Not guilty , " he said , standing , although it was n't necessary . The judge looked at Maslan . " The evidence of your statement at the enquiry yesterday contradicts your plea . Do you now have counterproof evidence to indicate that the original statement was false ? "  |p107Maslan  shook his head . " No , mercy , we do not . " " What about my statement ? " cried Holland . " What about my reasons for doing what had to be done ? You must listen  --  the world must listen ! " " A trial is a private matter between the accused and the government , " said the judge . " No outside witness may be privy to what occurs in these chambers , under the terms of the Compact . Extenuating circumstances have been adjudged not to exist in this case , David Holland ; you have already admitted to the truth of the charges . Therefore there can only be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picking up his ancient symbol of office and rapping it sharply on the little wooden block . The ceremony done , he lay the gavel down on his bench and folded his hands . With his bristly topknot , he seemed the caricature of a petty government official , one enjoying this moment of personal power even if there were no audience to share his pleasure . " David Holland , in the absence of extenuating circumstances , the penalty for violation of the Compact is clear and compelling . The court may in its wisdom temper the administration of justice by casing the degree of punishment , but in this case sees no reason for leniency . Because of your crimes against the Compact and the citizens of the world , you are hereby Declassified to the ranks of the unclassified , and will be transported from this district at the first opportune moment . " With the pronouncement the shield that separated the bench from the witness box went opaque , the first intimation that Holland had had of its existence . He turned to Maslan , but the defender @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ papers so that he would not have to meet Holland 's gaze . David started to speak , then thought better of it . What use to force an issue on an obviously unwilling audience ? The man was performing his own function under compulsion , so let him escape . The door slid open and the two guards were there , the samep108one advancing with the wrist control . Before the shock could stab through him once more , Holland had time for one last clear thought : triumph . He knew that they would never find all of the androids . They were too well hidden , well covered .. . particularly his own son . Clay Holland . . . android !  |p109Clay  was aware that they were beginning to attract attention from the villagers , the men in the circle staring openly . Even Turok sensed something happening and raised his besotted head , mumbling something unintelligible . Nothing like Garlan'sdress had ever been seen in this village , and no woman like this one had stirred the lust urge basic in the males . The women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine ; a stir of excitement swept around the little arena . " Reject me , " said Garlan , softly , " and Turok will take me first . When he 's done , the others can have their sport . " Clay knew that his ears were flaming with embarrassment as he stared deep into the Karyllian woman 's eyes . They burned with strong fires , were nothing like the eyes she had worn earlier . Was the woman a witch , able to change form and parts at will ? " What should I do ? " he asked , nearly choking . " First put your arms around me . " It was necessary to release her wrists first , Clay sure that she was laughing at him as he did so . A rage against her boldness fo-med deep in his chest as he complied with her instructions . He did know what to do with a woman ... but he had never expected to be called upon to perform the social graces in so unusual a place . Garlan was not the first female @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself as he placed his suddenly oversize hands against her back , gathering her into an awkward embrace . There had been others , even a public woman who had taught him the final meaning of the words " male " and " female . "  |p110Why  then was it disconcerting to discover that despite the wide variance in their size and physical structure , she fitted well , even comfortably , against him ? His robes prevented Clay from feeling the lines of her body as they melded with his own , but her scent was stronger now in his nostrils , her grip as forcefulas it had been this afternoon when she wrapped both hands around his neck . " Well ? " She was laughing at him . " Kiss me . " Clay did as she ordered , his lips barely brushing hers , the pressure so light that he did n't realize her mouth was parting . He tried to pull away then , but Garlan held him close , whisperinginto his ear . Beneath the perfume her scent was clean , and he wondered how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her words were further instruction . " Tell Turok that you 're taking me to your bed , Clahyh . But watch Mah-tan ! " Clay looked around the circle , the men dropping their eyes even though it would have been near impossible for him to see them staring in the dim light of the now-banked cooking fires . A few of the villagers had left the circle with their choices , althoughmost had returned to their place in the group . There was giggling as many of the men busied themselves pleasing the women in an attempt to hide their new focus of interest . Martin was still slumped in his stupor , the snore that was his trademark issuing from his gaping mouth . Clay broke free from Garlan 's embrace to capture the headman 's attention . " You ! Great Turok ! " The old man peered from beneath heavy lids , one eye nearly closed in an obscene wink . " I choose this one for tonight . We go now to the hut . " Turok mumbled something that Clay took to be reluctant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , perhaps remembering and regretting his rejection of the afternoon . Garlan 's wrist was pressing against the circle of Clay 's thumb and forefinger . He had the presence of mind to close the circle and pull her away from the gathering , feeling the jealous eyes of the villagers drilling deep into his back.  | " Turok is planning how to take me , " said Garlan as soon as they were beyond the nearest but . " He knows now he made a mistake , and he does n't like that . He 's thinking he 's been made a fool . " " What can they do ? " " Seek to avenge the insult . " " Against you ? " She laughed , stopping now to look back , as though expecting pursuit . " Against a woman ? He would lose all honor . No , he will strike against you . " She started to move on through the darkness , but Clay caught her wrist , pulling her back . He again caught her arms . " This has gone far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explanations , Garlan . Again I ask  --  who are you , and what are you ? " " We 've no time for words now , Clahyh . We must move swiftly . I 've two hakyar already saddled with our baggage . If we ride fast , we can be four granyar away before the Light comes back . " " No . " He shook his head . " Answers now ! " " Clahyh , you must leave the village now ! If Turok and his men do n't kill you , Mah-tan will ! " Clay stared , uncertain for a moment that he had heard correctly . Her statement was preposterous . .. but Peter Stone had said that Martin was a probable enemy . Were the Reformationistsaware of Clay 's own role in this matter ? The mission was as much to determine the other agent 's true loyalties as for any other reason . Still , Clay found it difficult to believe that another Earthman would have reason to kill him . Such things happened only on the public channel . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " How do you know ? " he demanded . Garlan saw that she must humor him . " Mah-tan himself told me . " Clay felt trapped in ancient slapstick , which was currently undergoing a revival in the citizen 's entertainment media . The matter was becoming more and more ludicrous , each time thatp112Garlan spoke her words pummeling him further with the airfilledbladder . There was no real pain for the actor , yet there was hurt that could not be ignored . But if this were slapstick , where was the audience ... and the laughter ? He closed his eyes , concentrating on his dilemma ... and then his ears separated a single sound from the night background , one made forever recognizable through years of field exercises on Earth . Every cadet schooling to be an agent had been caught by that sound again and again , until a special neural pathway was burned deep into the patterns of the brain . One lesson of stinging eyes and heaving belly was enough to ensure alertness during training techniques ; repeated a score of times , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remainedfunctioning at any near-normal level . There was only the single soft pop as the plastic shell of the gas grenade self-destructed , but Clay reacted instinctively , dropping to the ground and pulling the native woman down with him . His hand went over her mouth for an instant while he wasted precious oxygen of his own on a single warning . " Do n't breathe ! " Then he was scrabbling away on knees and elbows , his hand still tugging her wrist and forcing her to follow as best she could . Garlan understood the significance of Clay 's actions , locking her lungs and rolling with him , ignoring the damage the ground was doing to the dress . They covered perhaps ten meters and rolled against the next hut , then Clay was up in a crouching run , putting distance between them and the small cloud of death that was even now dissipating , rising into the air where it could harm no one but a chance night bird after its unsuspecting dinner . They wove through the haphazard arrangement of huts , not stopping until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the grassy verge of the knoll . Clay let himself fall back then , gasping in deep lungfuls of clean air as his eyes saw red sparks dancing from the temporary oxygen starvation . " What is it , Clahyh ? " " Gas . " He looked toward her , saw that Garlan was on herp113hands and knees , watching the direction from which they had just come . He sensed the perplexed expression , her features ghostly pale as the bright moon started to appear over the ring of hills to the east . " Poison that moves through the air , " he said now . " You ca n't see it and once you smell it , you 're dead . " The gas in the grenades carried by agents in the field was not the regurgitant used against the unsuspecting cadets . It killed silently and swiftly , the invisible cloud catching the air in the lungs and the voice in the throat . Even while it choked it was filtering through the pores , traveling through the bloodstream to freeze the heart in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , reading the fright in his voice . " What devil 's death is this ? " " It had to be Martin , " he said , resigned . " It could be no one else . " " I warned you ! " said Garlan , excited . " Mal-tan was only pretending to be drunk , Clahyh . Give me my knife  --  my soul must have the taste of his blood ! " " We 've got to get away . Where are the hakyar ? " " We ca n't run now , Clahyh . It 's too late for escape . We must kill Mah-tan before he can summon help from the villagers . Give me my knife ! " The hatred was sharp in her voice , seemed almost an aura visible about her body . On her knees now , she held out both hands to him , beseeching . " My knife ! " He felt within his robe and touched the hilt of the obsidian blade , caressing it briefly . Then he brought the thieves ' badge out , reluctantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he feel that he could trust her  --  hut at the moment there seemed to be no one else but Garlan to trust . " Your bootlace , " she said . " I need it . " It was clear that the native woman was far more familiar with this situation than Clay , even with his training for the bizarrerealities of alien planets . He bent to do as she said , thep114top of his boot flapping wide open as he unwound the leather thong . She took it , measured a short piece , and cut it with her knife , giving him back the lesser part . " Use this to tie the top of your boot so it does n't hinder your movements . " He did as instructed , and while still bending , released three of the gas grenades from his own cache . After a second thought he added three of the explosives from the other heel , their cases brittle enough to enable differentiation from the gas grenades without his having to look . If Martin was going to violate the Compact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same weapons available . At the moment , however , this was still an affair of silence , the explosives only a last resort . He started to touch Garlan 's shoulder to show that he was ready , and saw that the native woman was bunching her skirt about her waist , tying it out of the way with the remains of his bootlace . Her movements now unencumbered , she nodded to him , and they moved together back among the huts . Where was Martin ? Clay remembered his decision to give up the search for Garlan this afternoon , futile with so many open hiding places ; it was much worse now with darkness covering the huts , making them impenetrable . No lamps were lit , all of the villagers either around the arena or lost in lust that needed no lighting . Only one thing made their task easier : Martin must also be searching for them , to finish what he had failed to do with the gas attack . Clay wished for a glowtoreb in his pocket , but such items were restricted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of alien technology should they be discovered . It was impossible to conceal a functioning atomic light in the presence of the natives , and so the agents were forbidden its comfortseven when locked away in their private fortresses , lest one should accidentally be distributed in the wrong place . Thcy were forced to get along with the illumination available at this technological stage of Karyllia 's development , bad as itp115was . Nor could they suddenly introduce incandescent lamps or even arc lighting ; electricity was still many technological generationsin the future . The bright moon made it easier to slip between the huts , but made it more difficult for them to hide in the shadows that were now sharply delineated across the ground . At first Clay found himself confused in their present location ; then his naturalsense of place let him mark out the direction of Mura 's hut , to their right . " Where are the hakyar ? " he asked , whispering . Garlan looked at his face , saw no intent to flee ; her sharp retortevaporated . " On the other side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Any danger they 'll be discovered ? " " No . They 're tethered well away from the others . " He nodded , satisfied , and started toward the center of the village . But before they had covered half the distance there was a sudden outcry , voices raised in anger and outrage . " Mah-tan ! " said Garlan , softly . " He 's told the others . " There was a great deal of drunken cursing , Turok 's bellow prominent in the uproar . Clay froze , wondering again if it would not be best to retreat now , deal with Martin later . He could return to Ahd-Abbor , summon help from the temple . But Garlan was moving ahead , toward the commotion . Angry , Clay thought nasty words to describe the woman 's idiocy . But he knew he could n't leave her to her own devices ; as competent as she had proven herself , she was no match against the strength of the village men . He moved after her , caught her as she crouched by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulder , watching the scene of total confusion . Turok was on his feet , shouting curses , while Martin was moving around the circle , kicking the village men into movement . But they were too drunk to respond as he wanted , staggeringwhen they tried to stand , many of them falling over or slowly folding back to the ground . The agent was cursing him/self , in Standard and in the gutter dialect of the district , his words no more effective than his blows . " Turok ! " he shouted . " What useless dak-beasts do you hide in the skins of your men ? " The insult was terrible , but the response was no greater than before . The last of the villagers sat down , his legs out straight before him , his hands between his thighs . He stared up at the angry Earthman , giggling foolishly . Then in slow motion he fell over on his side , snoring . With a final kick at the hapless man , Martin strode from the arena into the darkness . There was nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the problem of Martin  --  and heard a muffled cursingin his inner ear as the agent stumbled against something in darkness and activated his communicator . There were other sounds , soft rustlings and a sudden intake of breath that made him think the other to be in one of the huts . Clay touched his own skull , tracing the shape of the implant but careful not to activate the transmitter as another sharp curse came , Martin bumping into something else . There were fifty huts , but only one logical choice as Martin 's location . Clay moved swiftly toward Mura 's but , covering the distance in less than a minute , fearful that Martin would come out again . But the sounds continued in the communicator , as though the other were searching for something . Clay 's pack , alreadyremoved by Garlan ? " Holland , where is it ? " Clay stiffened as the question came sharp in his car . But it became obvious that Martin was only talking to himself , lamentinghis failure to locate whatever it was . If he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was some item of off-world technology . What could he have smuggled from the temple ? Mura 's but was before him , the thatched roof silvery in the bright moonlight . Clay stared , crouching , his fingers touching the ground as he planned his next move . Then his eyes made out bulk in the shadow against the but wall which after twentyp117seconds of concentration resolved into the shape of Garlan . The unusual shape of her tied-up skirt made the first recognitionuncertain . The shadow moved , straightened , a brief flash of paler color as her face turned toward Clay and he knew that she was aware of his presence . Then she was crouching again , moving toward the door , the knife a black shape in her hand as she moved out of the shadow . Was she fool enough to try slipping into the hut ? Martin would be sure to see her outlined against the entrance . It was foolhardy , and he could think of only one way to stop her . He touched the implant and pressed with two fingers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He spoke loud enough for Garlan to hear his voice ; she stopped , looking toward him , angry . In his ear Clay heard anothersharp intake of breath , the other agent unaware that his own words could be heard . Martin was listening . " I know where you are , " said Clay . " You ca n't get away . I know why you are doing this , Martin , but it is n't going to work . You 've failed . " Still no answer ; Clay could hear the blood pounding in Martin'sskull as the other man stopped breathing . " I do n't want to kill you ! Come out now ! " Garlan was moving back into the deeper shadows , Clay distractedfrom the but entrance for an instant as he tried to follow her movement . He quickly returned his attention to the door , alert for anything the other agent might decide to do . " Martin . " He tried again . " Come out now ! " A spark flared in the shadows and Clay quickly looked that way again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , holding it against the hanging thatch . There were several more sparks , and then one landed on a straw , found fuel to feed its growth . Several seconds passed without apparent change , and then suddenly there was a worm of red coal several centimeters long . It flamed , and the fire licked hungrily at the material of the roof . Seconds later it flared again , and then was racing , a ravenous beast , through the straw thatching.  |p118Clay  heard Martin breathe sharply again , but for a minute he did nothing . Then the agent choked and coughed as smoke started to fill the interior of the but . The stuff trickled into his lungs , sending him into a wracking spasm , and now Clay could hear him crashing about without the aid of the communicator . " Martin ! " he said , sharply . " You fool ! Get out now while there 's still time . Move ! " For another twenty seconds there was no response as the flames spread rapidly over the cone of the roof . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first section suddenly caving in and sending a shower of sparks into the sky . Clay watched in horror , not knowing what to do , as he saw Garlan move around the wall of the but again , her knife once more ready . There was another deep coughing , audible clearly in both the communicator and from the hut ; and then Martin started toward the door , bending low at the waist to crash through the entrance .. . Where Garlan was waiting , her knife slashing in a long upwardstroke as the Earthman 's arms flailed wildly . His impetus was enough to carry him half a dozen steps from the burning hut , and then he stumbled to his knee , his hand grasping the hilt of the blade that still quivered in his belly . Even as Clay rushed to him he fell forward , dead.  |p119The  pain burned deep through David Holland 's neural system , permanently etched as a reminder of horror before the wrist device was finally released . He trembled violently as his body was returned to the control of his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been the impression of elevators , corridors , cars , a long trip someplace in an enclosed vehicle , never once a release from the control mechanism . They were in a large room with a long counter , manned by two blues at the moment ; a bored technician sat in a chair that was tilted back against the wall , a portable tape reader competing with the blaring public channel on a wall screen . He looked up briefly as Holland was brought in , but the distraction was not important enough to cause him to stop the tape . The first violent reaction to release was easing now , but the tremor held steady , Holland 's hands shaking as he held them out before him . He was aware now of bladder pressure , painfullystabbing , and tried to speak . But his voice was only a croak , his tongue swollen in dry mouth . He touched it against his lips , mouth opening to relieve the pressure , and found that they were cracking . How long had he been under control ? From the condition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours . " Come on , happy ! Get movin ! " One of the two blue guards who had brought him grabbed his elbow , forcing him to face the counter . " New fish for ya , locker . Big ' un . " One of the two men behind the counter came over , catching the small folio of documents as it was tossed . He broke the pressure seal , dumping the records and tapes out in a haphaz/and pile that he stirred with his fingers . David recognized his personal records in the lot , the ID card that had been a part of him since his elevation to yellow . The man spotted it , picked it up , holding it between two fingers so his fellow could see . " Ghee ! A yellow . " He grinned , showing discolored teeth that made Holland glance away . " We du n't see lotta these down here , do we , Harky ? Knock ' em alla way clown , smartass yel-low ! " The technician heard the exchange , looked up to stare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his chair thumped on the floor and he was coming over to take the card from the blue 's fingers . He studied Holland as he slipped the card into the reader on the counter , then let his eyes flick quickly over the transcribed information . His expression never changed as he finished , giving the card back to the blue and returning to his chair . The chair back thunked against the wall again , a line of white chewed through the painted plaster where it struck , and the tape reader went back into service . " He ai n't yellow no more , " said the guard . " C'm on , blue , make ' em happy so 's we c'n get . " The ID card was fed into a small machine attached to the side of the reader , and a moment later a duplicate popped out  --  a duplicate with several differences . The new card was featurelessgray with a cord perhaps fifteen centimeters long attached to one corner . The yellow original was fed into the maw of another slot , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powder a yellow , " said the locker , grinningagain . " Okay , happy , shuck ' em . " Holland stared blankly , and the man grew irritated . " Wotcher , empty in the ears , happy ? Bare ass it , now ! " The guard chuckled . " Mebbe he thinks you 're gon na bedboy'em for a nickel , locker . " " Nah ! " The man hacked and started to spit , then cast a quick look at the technician . He saw that he was being watched with a disapproving eye , so swallowed his phlegm , shaking his head . " He 's too old . Bedboys got ta be pretty as slickies. "  |p121Holland  understood the order at last and began unsealing his clothing . He found no particular embarrassment in nudity , but the circumstances were so degrading that his ears flamed . He worked slowly , his fingers fumbling with the seam locks , but at last everything was in a small pile . It was not much , as the remains of what had once been a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gesture from the locker , David placed his garments on the counter . The man placed the gray card in the reader and keyed instructions , and in another half minute parcels began popping up from the counter : a one-piece coverall , underwear , socks , heavy shoes that looked uncomfortable . He went along the counter , assembling the items into a single pile which he slapped down before Holland . " Gim me your wrist , happy . Not that one , your left one , empty ! Doncher know your left from your right ? " Holland held out the demanded hand and the cord of the gray card was snapped in place , the end sealing itself seamlessly against the body . The locker tested it a time or two , David wincing as his hand was held tight and the cord cut into the flesh , a white line appearing . " Lose it an ' y ' lose a week 's joy juice , " said the locker . " Get dressed , empty ! " Holland reached for the pile of new clothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would permit . The clothing was correct in size , but the cut was unfamiliar and felt strange as it slid over his skin . The shoes were heavy and awkwardon his feet . " Harky , this'un 's ready . Take'em down to 34M . " Harky opened a flap in the counter and came out ; he had been observing in silence through the ceremonies . Now he spoke his first word . " Move . " It came out painfully , his brow knotting . Holland waited for amplification , but nothing more came ; at last he started toward the door through which he had apparently entered . It was the correct choice , Harky coming after him . Thep122man was a plodder , moving slowly , but Holland was too weak to move any faster himself . He waited in the corridor until Harky led him down a ramp three levels deep and out into another corridor . There were double doors spaced at long intervals , all of them closed . Harky led the way past several , and then turned , although there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open to the guard and the bedlam of a public channel at peak volume exploded from within . Holland staggeredunder the noise level , his head immediately throbbing ; he stumbled through and into a large room that seemed filled withi hundreds of men , all dressed in clothing like his own . Most ofthem were slumped in rows of plastic chairs that were fixed to the floor , but a few circled the walls in constant motion while others sat on the floor itself . Most of the latter seemed to be ignoringthe outsized screen that took most of the wall space at the front of the room . Once in the midst of the maelstrom , the sound level was no longer quite so unbearable . Harky ignored it completely as he moved toward a small plastic desk in one corner that was manned by another blue . The man looked up as they approached , his attention torn from the screen . " New fish or changer ? " asked the blue , standing . Harky 's brow furrowed in concentration , and the man waved the questionoff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy . Where you from ? " " I , uh , am new , " said David . " Please ! I have to use the toilet ! " " Gim me your card first . Yeah , do what you 're told , happy , an ' you 'll be happy . " The card went into the reader , recording the safe arrival of the new man , the blue frowning as a slip of plastic popped out . He stared in intense concentration , his mouth shaping the symbolson the card . " Okay , happy . We 'll fin ' your bed now an ' you 'll be all set . C'm on . " " I ca n't ! " begged David . " Please ! "  |p123The  blue was at first irritated , and then amused . " Okay , happy . Do n't pee your pants  --  do it in there . " He laughed loudly as he pointed toward an open door , the joke going past the limited intelligence of Harky . Holland had no chance to share the emotion ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over now in his agony . When he made it through the door he was disturbed to find no private stalls , but any embarrassment was lost in his need . He was still in pain when he finished adjusting his clothing and washed , but the intensity was no longer agonizing . He found drinking water at the end of the row of sinks and greedilytook it in too fast , was sick almost instantly . When he again managed to wipe his mouth he took just enough of the water to ease the dryness , letting it soak in . The blue had returned to watching the screen when David at last came out ; he looked up , perplexed , as Holland shuffled to a halt before the desk . " Wotcher want , happy  --  oh ! You 're the new fish . Wotcher want ? " " My bed , " David said , patiently . " You said you 'd show it to me . " " I did ! Wotcher , empty in the ears ? Wan na lose your joy juice , stupid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slip of plastic still on the desk . " I can read . I 'll find it myself . " The blue stared in sullen anger , but after a moment he pushed the slip across to David . " Awright ! Don ' bother me no more today ! Empty in the ears . .. " He continued to mutter to himself as David took the slip and turned away , but his attention soon returned to the entertainment . Holland looked around the large room ; at the back were long rows of tables with fixed backless stools . Two other large doorways opened off the main space , one to the right and one beyond the dining area . He chose the nearest one , which turned out to be the dormitory . He stood in the doorway , staring ; there were four rows ofp124bunks , tiered three high , the rows stretching away end to end for fifty meters or more . The card in his fingers said B-24-2 ; the end of each row was marked with a large letter , and there were numbers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off until he reached 24 , which was one from the far end ; a was the middle tier , chest high . He leaned against it , eyes closing as the trembling suddenly became stronger . For a moment he continued to shake as his forehead rested against the mattress . Visions of the rows of bunks danced across his closed eyes in unending numbers : four rows , twenty-five beds to each , three tiers high . Three hundred beds in this dormitory , three hundred drones to share quarters with , when he had never in his life shared space with more than his parents , later Janice and his son . With Janice only for fifteen years now . " You ca n't go to bed now , happy " He looked up ; an old man was standing there , a bent figure shaken by a palsy stronger than Holland 's own . His hands were held before him , the tips of the fingers barely touching as they shook against each other , and now he shuffled a step closer . " Blue catches you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to-night . " " I 'm sick , " David explained . " Makes no diff'rence . " He shook his head . " Go out in the court an ' lay down there . Medic check before breakfas ' only , ' less you 're screamin ' . You 'll scream more if it ai n't serious . " The old man peered from rheumy eyes that were clouded . " You ai n't a changer . You been Declassified ? " Holland nodded . " Yes . " " Thought so . Un always tell . These Nappies are empty in the ears , all of ' em . I was green . Green all the way . Had wife , gon na have kid ... both gone . " A tear was forming in the corner of his eye . " All gone . No more green no more . They put me here put me here . " David was embarrassed by the sudden deterioration in the old man as he turned away , shuffling off , muttering to himself as his head bobbed back and forth. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped , turned , blinked in surprise . " Name ? Happy they call me , blue an ' blue . " He held up his dangling gray card . " No name no more , jus ' this an ' happy . Bruno it was , but no more . No more no green . " He turned again and was gone , leaving Holland to find the strength to move away from the bunk . He wanted only to sleep , to rest , to put his head down someplace ... but he also knew better than to cause trouble his first hour in the barracks . At last he retraced his steps to the door to the dayroom , looking out at his barracks mates ; perhaps two-thirds of the chairs were full , and the sight of  --  the nearest empty one tempting . But the blare of the screen was too much to contend against . The old man had said to go into the court ; he looked toward the only other door , and saw that there was another large room beyond . He started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lean against the dining tables when he reached them . There was further pressure from his bladder as his body adjusted to the recent evacuation , the organ shaping itself again to a normal level ; but he could not fight the journey to the facility again . The row of stools was tempting also , but they were circular and spaced far enough apart that he knew there would be no rest for his aching back if he did lay across them . Then he was standing in the entrance to the court without remembering the last dozen steps . The court was a room as large as the other two , but totally devoid of furnishings or contents , other than the fifty or sixty men standing , walking , and lying about . The light source came from the ceiling , not bright enough to be distracting . He moved in , wondering how those bodies lying in the centerof the space could stand the obviously hard material of the floor . The chairs before the screen would be better . Then he saw that the composition of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he tested the new area , it yielded beneath his weight . Holland sank to his knees , pain darting through them ; thenp126put his hands out to cushion the blow as his body fell under the no longer bearable strain of its own weight . He rolled , landingon his side with his knees drawn up ; then rolled again , onto his back , the floor actually comfortable even though there was no pillow . He shifted again , stretching out flat as his eyes closed in completeexhaustion and sleep finally .. . Holland blinked , staring up at the ceiling , for a few seconds not remembering where he was . He started to glance at his wrist , but in place of his watch was only the gray Ill card , dangling from its cord . The sight brought back awareness . The other men in the room were moving toward the entrancein answer to the summons that had brought him from sleep . He tried to sit up , struggling to get his hands behind him for support , making it with an effort . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nerve-ending , but at the same time the terrible fatigue was diminished . " Supper , happy . " Old Bruno was standing just inside the entrance . " You do n't eat it now , some other empty 'll grab it . Long time till breakfas ' . " Bruno turned after delivering his message and was gone beforeHolland could come to his feet . His balance was unsteady for the first few steps , and then he was able to move faster . He saw the others lining up before a row of robot vendors he had not noticed before ; others were moving toward the toilet , so obviouslythere was time enough to relieve the pressure before joining the lines . As he came back to the lines , his hands and face at least feelingclean , he saw the first men presenting their cards to a panel atop the vendors . Each was served with a tray , which was taken to the nearest table . By the time Holland received his own he had to weave through the rows of tables to find a vacant stool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old man , but that table was filled . At last he settled for a spot between two greedy eaters who shoveled the food into their mouths as fast as possible.  |p127He  stared at his tray before picking up his implement ; the menu was basic ration , nourishing though not particularly interesting . He began to cat as the man on his left picked up his tray to lick away the last traces of the food . Then the space was empty , giving him more elbow room and less disgust to work on his own meal . The food did make him feel better physically . He had never imagined the conditions in a barracks , never even wondered at the life led by the drones . They were there at the bottom of the scale , the consumers who were fed and housed and entertained , but until this moment David Holland had no concept of what those three words could cover at the far end of the scale . He finished , returning his tray to the vendor . There was a different blue on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six hours . He started to return to the court , to escape some of the bedlam , when Bruno appeared before him . " Juice time pretty soon . " Apparently the old man had adopted him , a relationship David did n't mind . Bruno had information that he needed , could get no place else . " I do n't want any joy juice , " he said . The old man immediatelybecame cunning , casting conspiratorial glances to either side . " Gi ' it to me ! I wan ' it ! " " Fair enough  --  but I want some information . You help me and I 'll give you my juice . " Bruno 's head bobbed eagerly . " ' s fair deal yes . Rots your brain terrible stuff yes . I was green . What you wan na know ? " David closed his eyes , thinking . " Do they ever let us out of here ? Sweep the barracks ? " " Naw , not these empties . Dumbheads dumb . Sweep the busters , they got smarts . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head . " Bad trouble yes . No good no good no good . No go there bust ass . Nonono ! " " All right . " Holland held up his hands . " There must be some times when we get to go out . Think ! "  | " Novo . " He shook his head again . " No never . No go out everythin ' here . No . " " What about the women ? There are only men here  --  when do they let us see the females ? " Bruno giggled ; his tremor increased with his excitement . " No women , not empties like these . I was green ; had wife , had kid . They 're too dumb . Use bedboys , them that 's smart enough to know what to do with ' em ! " " There must be something  --  sick call ! You said medic check was before breakfast . They ca n't keep the sick here ; where do they take them ? " " Shot in ass , kick in head . Go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was green now I 'm stupid . Rotten juice rotten brain . Nonono . " His eyes were tearing again . " The hospital ! " David insisted . " Where is it ? Tell me , Bruno . " The old man was lost in feeling sorry for himself . He shuffled away , everything but his own loss forgotten . David stared after him in frustration , wanting to ask a dozen more questions . It was obvious that Bruno would have to be peeled slowly , the informationextracted in small bits and pieces . Escape . The thought had been there at the back of his mind even before his arrest , the eventuality considered and carefully walled away from his conscious mental activity . But he was here now , and knew already that it would be only a matter of time before he was as insane as Bruno if he was forced to stay in the barracks . A sudden scream came from the screen ; good of Doc Arko was at it again , he of the never-mentioned circus . Holland glanced that way just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to an instant range ; seconds later Arko was indulging himself in his favorite food while his latest victim still pleaded for mercy . Repulsed , Holland looked away again ; he had never heard of the ancient pornographic meaning of the word circus , would not have understood the attraction of those who could be entrancedby such sexual spectacle . Holland was a man of his own time , a well-adjusted individual who concentrated almost com/pletely on his life 's work . He knew affection for Janice , perhaps even love since they had married ; the same emotion went to their adopted android son . But his strong feelings had been reserved for the Project , for the work being done to rescue the human race from complete degeneration to the level of the men around him . These were tomorrow , and the thought was frightening . " Juice time ! " The blue bellowed the words , bringing instant reaction ; it seemed as though every man in the barracks was on his feet and lining up . David remembered his promise to Bruno ; he joined one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first men to present their cards . The plastic bottles popped out and were carried away quickly , sonic hugging the precious cargo close , others ripping away the tops and letting the effervescent narcotic gush into their greedy mouths . The line moved quickly . Suddenly the blue stopped one man as he was about to grab his bottle . " Not you , empty ! You was stupid las ' night . I tol ' you not to be stupid las ' night . No juice for you . " He grabbed the bottle away as the man stared , perplexed . At last he shook his head and moved away , the blue shoving the confiscated prize into his own shirt . A minute later lie did it again , Holland noting that he picked on only the least intelligent ; presumably he also knew that they would not protest or fight back . By the time David had the promised bottle for Bruno the blue had half a dozen of the confiscated treasures , going back to the desk to stow them in the drawer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a deep suck , then wiping his mouth with obvious pleasure . Many of the men were moving toward the dormitory , climbinginto their beds to slip eagerly into the narcotic dreams induced by the juice . The ones David could see were not bothering to undress , even their shoes . The restrictions were obviouslyoff now , and the idea of bed was the most temptingp130thought of the day ; but first be looked around for Bruno to deliver the bribe . Just as he saw the old man and moved toward him to press his bottle into his hands , the door to the corridor opened , admittinga pair of blues . They stopped to glance around the barracks , idly curious ; then moved to the desk to give the attendanta slip . He studied it , then stood up . " Hollan ' ! Where you at , you dumb empty ? " David ignored the implied insult , moving as quickly as he could toward the summons . " I 'm Holland . " " Yeah ? Gim me y'r card . " It was pressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attendant puzzled out the comparison of names on the slip and the ID card . At last he released David 's arm . " Yeah , you Hollan ' . You real smartass , huh ? You in trouble now . " His heart sank as the blue leered in triumph , wondering what further undisclosed regulation he had trespassed . The blues made no attempt to explain the rules to the newcomers , assuming that they were drones from a lifetime of experience and should know what not to do . The brief thought of planningescape disappeared again . " Okay , Holland . " One of the newcomers took his elbow . " You belong to us now . Let 's go . " He stumbled as he tried to keep up with them , expecting a curse ; but the blues immediately slowed their own pace to match . Then they were through the doors and into the corridor , and the bedlam of the screen was cut off . There was a roaringin his ears as his aural sense adjusted to the absence of clamagingsound , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . He shook his head , swallowing , but the whine was there , making their footsteps in the corridor sound strangely distant . They rose a level . This corridor was much the same as the one just left , with a rank of doors exactly like the others . Assumingthat they were more of the dormitories , he was not surprised when his escorts stopped before doors no more visiblyp131marked than any of the others . His brow furrowed as he tightenedagainst the expected resurge of the sound storm as one of the blues pressed his palm against the key ; he winced as the door slid back .. . It was another complex like the last , but there was no rush of sound to overwhelm his senses again ; the public channel was playing , but the sound level was turned down to a bearable and even reasonable level . As he followed the blues into the dayroom , he saw much the same arrangement already familiar , but there were immediate differences . The gray-uniformed men here were of an obviously higher level of intelligence ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formations , eyes dulled from inability to understand the complex world around them , no brains rotted from the narcotic that made barracks life bearable . " All right , Holland . We have to check you in . " David looked at the man , saw that he was smiling . Yet it was not the sadistic grin of the warders he had seen to this point , no hint in the clear blue of the pupils that the mind looking out was planning to swing out in cruelty , catching an unsuspectingdefective with sudden pain . Except for the cut of their uniforms , which marked their rank , these two men could have been citizens of any rank . He followed the blue to the corner desk , presenting the card on his wrist to the man on duty . The attendant nodded a greeting , taking David 's hand and guiding the card to the reader , rather than grabbing it and tugging , forcing the cord to cut into the flesh . Puzzled , he turned to survey the large room . Now he saw that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close , many of them obviously under the effects of the narcotic . But even those with lost eyes and vacant smiles were clearly not the low-grade defectives inhabiting the other ward . There were a number of groups clustered around the dining tables . There were several card games going , and more than one chessboard in use ; others were only talking , quietly and intently . One of them seemed familiar ..  | " Nathan ! " The technician heard his name called , rising and turning as Holland moved toward him eagerly , arms out to greet him . He came forward , a caricature of himself in the awkward-fitting drone coverall . His bony wrists protruded from the sleeves . . . and as they clasped arms , Holland saw that despite his clothes , he did not wear the dangling gray mark of the drone.  |p133Garlan  moved quickly , reaching the fallen Martin seconds before Clay . She rolled the body onto its side , the knees drawingup in a horrible cartoon of the fetal position . The hands gripped the belly , the edge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to avoid death , the fingers of one hand nearly sliced off . Before Clay could give voice to his horror the little Karyllian was withdrawing the blade , wiping it on the bleached fabric of the priest robes . In the moonlight the stains on the cloth were black . " Come now , Clahyh ! " She rose to her feet , looking toward the center of the village for an instant , then back at Holland . " We must leave . " " And leave him ? " Surprise showed on her face . " And why not ? Would you carry the meat with you ? Let the carrion sweeps take him , he 'll feel no pain for it . " " Why did you kill him ? " he demanded . Amusement briefly curled her lips . " You would rather be dead in his place ? You said yourself not ten minutes ago that he was trying to kill us . Come ! There 's no more time to prattle . You may have no great liking for your skin , Clahyh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even as she spoke , the last words coming over her shoulder , she was leaving , her feet gliding softly across the packed ground . Clay could not make out the tiny noise of her footsteps  --  but the dead man 's skull picked up the vibration of the movements , sending it through the still-activated corn/municator . It seemed to explode into his ear , a horrifying sushswishthat was a mockery of death 's leaving . He stepped back , the thicker thudding of his heels also clearly audible . It was too much ; he turned and fled , following the lead of the little woman . They met no human obstacle as they continued through the darkness , the fire as yet not seen by those around the arena . Garlan reached the hakyar first and clapped her hands sharply in signal for them to kneel . Clay glanced up the knoll as he settledinto the saddle , fastening his belt tightly ; the huts were a cluster of dark shapes around the growing fire . He could not understand the failure of the villagers to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sky , almost black themselves as they passed against the orb of the bright moon . They were fallingback now , a gentle shower of pretty flakes that carried death as they settled onto other roofs . There was a scream then in the night , and then a flare as anotherthatching caught suddenly ; an instant later a third was blossoming the orange death-bloom , and the fire-beast was free to rage across the village in its entirety as an evening breeze suddenly gusted strong . There were other screams now , and an uproar of shouting as Garlan urged her beast forward . Clay 's mount followed automatically , the hakyar shifting gear under the woman 's kicks to lurch into a semblance of a run . " Garlan ! " The rush of their own wind tore the word away from his lips as Clay fought to maintain his balance , the belt about his waist not enough to hold him securely in place . The towering saddle lurched wildly from side to side with each long loping stride of the running beast . Clay was holding to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when a sudden jolt would throw him back , his head cracking painfully against the back rest . Certain that the saddle lashes were about to tear free , Clay concentrated on falling , looking for the split-second warning that he was being tossed . The shock of Martin 's death had been buried by the need to concentrate on this immediate mo/ment , the questions that had started to rise in his mind shoved aside to fester by themselves . Since the first shout of the woman 's name there had been no breath in his aching lungs to spare for words . The speculations were there , but would have to wait . The village was well behind them now as the hakyar rushed over night-blind road . Clay prayed that the animals would not meet some obstacle in their path to cause them to stumble and fall , although the first mad rush had slowed somewhat . But there were no accidents ; perhaps the beasts had night vision instantly adaptable to the changing luminance . They flashed briefly into the open , a meadow silver-pale in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were in woods once more as the road continued to rise toward the south . They were coming to the end of the valley , and the pace of the hakyar slowed under the strain of the hill . Then they were on the crest of the circling ridge and Garlan was at last signaling her beast to stop , reining back as her mount seemed to dance sideways a few steps until Clay came up to her . She looked back . " They 'll not come after us now . " She seemed satisfied as she watched the distant fire storm spreading through the huts of Turok 's village . The circle was widening , a ring now , the center smoldering into darkness as the scant fuel of the huts construction material was quickly exhausted by the hungry flames . There were new flares of brightness coming from the very edge of the cluster , the village now a pyre that could be seen as dying even while the last new flares were touching off . " What of the villagers ? " asked Clay . " Did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " She shrugged , unconcerned . " If they had their wits about them . Who is fool enough to stay in the midst of certain death ? " " They are of your blood ! " Clay said , shocked again by her callousness . " There are no strong blood ties among such , Clahyh . My fa/ther sold me into slavery without protest from the others , as was his right . Not one , not even Turok , cared what might be my fate , so why should I now care for them ? " Clay was silent , having no answer . Yet he hoped that the villagershad managed to escape . He closed his eyes , trying not to think . Garlan read his mood and let him be , and when he looked again the ring of fire was noticeably lower , burning down . He could bear to watch it no more . He turned away , catching an expression of excitement on the woman 's face as she watched the final results of her work . He was sure that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moonlight although it was not bright enough to bring color to her skin . There was another fire in her eyes that seemed to burn fiercely , if only the reflection of the distant flames . He swallowed , uncomfortably aware of the tightness in his chest , knowing that he was tensed by an emotion that he did not clearly understand . " Now ! " The word exploded from his lips . " Tell me why this was done , Garlan  --  tell me all ! " She smiled , again touched by a secret amusement ; but there was no irony in her expression despite her following words . " You mean the men from heaven do not hold all of the secretsof the stars , Clahyh ? " She seemed much younger as their eyes met , locked ; he wondered how old she could be . Sold into slavery and marriage at eight . . . yet there was no indication that the body was anything more than a devilish child , black grime marking her face again , her dress in tatters . " You are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changed in an instant to anger . " Born on this planet your Mah-tan called a stinking mudball ! " she said , fiercely . " What do you know of other planets ? Of Earth ? " " Only that there are worlds as great as Karyllia circling many of the stars visible in the heavens  --  that Karyllia itself circles the sun , rather than the other way about as is known in the wisdom of the ages . You come from a world so far distant thatp137its sun is scarce a noticeable point in the night sky of Karyllia 's bottom . " " And of Earthmen ? " Now wonder tinged her voice , as though she could not encompassthe majesty of the universe but was now dealing with something close to her own understanding . " You are men of magic , able to do marvels at a whim .. . and yet I have seen you close , Clahyh , and know that you are no more than men . You have enemies , even each other . You fight among your own tribes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Clay , quietly . " Earth is a planet of peace  --  there have been no wars among Earthmen for three centuries now . All are joined together in one great tribe , GarIan , one great city . None suffer from lack of anything needed to make life possible or comfortable . " " No enemies ? " Garlan laughed in contempt . " Then why did Mah-tan hate you ? You were his enemy , Clahyh , though you knew it not . He always intended that you be killed . " " He was greedy . Even in the best of worlds there are men hungry for power , for riches . But how do you know these things , Garlan ? " " He sent me to rob you in the city . " Another shocking statement ; Clay frowned . " Of the filters ? " There was a blank look on her face , and then she remembered his earlier question . " The talisman you showed me ? I know it not , Clahyh . I was waiting for you when Mah-tan brought you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caravan to Ahd-Abbor . You were never from my sight , even in your temple . " Clay had paid little attention to the dak herders and the other natives who traveled with the caravan ; now he felt embarrassmentat his lack of alertness . Perhaps there had been other clues he should have seen , telling him that Martin was an enemy before Peter Stone 's revelations . As an observer for the trapped Stone , he was a poor choice , having failed miserably from the moment of his arrival on the planet 's surface . But . . . why ? How could Martin have known that Clay wasp138here for a reason other than normal service , when he did n't know himself ? " Why rob me ? " he demanded . " To delay you . Mah-tan wanted you in the great square when the call came to evening services . I know not why , but he thought you would die then . He was angered greatly to discover that you still lived when he carried you into the temple . " The natives of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conics of the Sanctum ; for them the subaural sounds served only as a hypnotic compulsion . Martin must also have been responsible for the deactivation of Clay 's shield .. . which meant that he had allies on the space station , for it could never have happened on the planet . He must also have stolen the filters . Indeed , the man must have been angered to find that he was not delivering a corpse to the temple medics . But . . . how time it so carefully ? They could easily have arrivedduring the earlier hours of the day , which would have knocked that particular plan of assassination silly . " How did he know that I would be in the square at the right moment ? " " He planned well , Clahyh . From the time you came down from the mountains he was seeking to delay the hour of your arrival . That was why you joined the caravan . He knew that the dak herders always came to the river in the late hours of the afternoon . Once across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the streets of Ahd-Abbor  --  a distance a man on foot should have covered in less than half the time he spent gulling you . He was leading you into trouble at every turn , Clahyh , and when he saw that time was still not dying fast enough , he signaled me to come against you for your purse . " Again Clay 's ears flamed . But that explained how Martin knew that Garlan had been at work when the youth had not been aware of her touch . " Why were you part of the affair  --  why now his enemy , Garlan ? Something must have happened during the week that I was in the temple . . . what ? "  |p139The  little woman was suddenly bitter , the lines of her face now harsh as her expression darkened . She sat straighter , the sudden movement causing the hakyar to shy away . Garlan pattedthe beast 's neck while her eyes continued to bum against Clay 's . " He came to the thieves  --  not Mah-tan , but one of those with them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that the Temple of Light was a false religion churched only to swindle the true Karyllians out of their very world . He said he was friend , the others in their priest robes , enemy who would kill us all . " Her voice continued harsh with her hatred as the native woman told of the men who had pretended friendship to Karyllia , all the while planning the very course ascribed to the others . " How did you learn that they lied ? " asked Clay . She slipped her hand into her pack , brought forth a small package , holding it up for Clay 's inspection ; he recognized a communicator powerful enough to reach the space station , and thus have its messages relayed to any point on the surface of the planet . " I have heard Mah-tan speak to one of these boxes in the tongue of the Earthmen . They did not know that I understood their words , but they came among the thieves while I was being sold into slavery . When two of them talked together , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard by the guild . In time we began to place meaning to their words , now we understand enough to know when the talk is of betrayal ! They are the ones who would take Karyllia , kill us in our trust ! They think us fools ! " " This happened since I came to Ahd-Abbor ? " " Not three days ago . I summoned a council of the guild , told them what I had heard . It is clear to us that Mah-tan and his kind are the enemy ; therefore you must be friend , Clahyh . You must be friend . . . else we shall have to kill you all ! " There were still a dozen questions , more , tumbling to the center of his thoughts , each demanding attention , immediatep140explanation . He shook his head , then pressed the tips of his fingers against his temples to still the confusion . A few seconds later he looked at her again . " You 're a woman . Why did Martin choose you to work against me ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I am also inconspicuous ; I can pass among a crowd as a boy , a man . Among thieves , it makes no difference what gender the gods gave you at birth . In the guild , only honor matters . And ability . I am a good thief . " " I 'm sure you are , " he said , dryly , knowing that her first discoveryhad been intentional . The second , earlier this afternoon , was only bad timing , the fortunes of chance . " Where did you get that ? " He indicated the communicator , surprised when she tossed it to him . He barely managed to catch it , juggling it for a second or two . " I took it from Mah-tan 's baggage this afternoon , " said GarIan . This then had been the object of his search after the grenadeattack  --  to summon help ? " Are only the thieves aware of the plot against Karyllia ? " he asked . " We need no others to help us crush an enemy , Clahyh . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these village fools ! " She spat to one side , showing her contempt as she had this afternoon . Now Clay understood the reason for her earlier actions . " Why were you on the road before us ? Did you know that our path lay this way ? " " I followed you from Ahd-Abbor . The western road leads only through this valley , Clahyh , and when I became certain that that was your path , I cut across country to be ahead . Tarok 's is the first village on the road , so it was certain that you were heading there . " " The bandits ? What charade were they ? " " None , " she said . " They were genuine . I did not expect to live to see your arrival , once they began to circle in . But theyp141were playing with me , intending my death to be sweet enough for a singer of lays . " Martin 's response must have also been genuine , although his motive could have been no more than boredom with the ride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sympathy or affection for a victim of bandits ... but his shock must have been genuine to find that it was Garlan that he had rescued . There had been no opportunity for him to speak to her once they were in the village , so his curiosity must have been burning . Until he saw the two of them leave the circle together . Unless , of course , Garlan was now lying . Clay studied her , closed his eyes to let the aura of her being penetrate his consciousness . It was a trick that sometimes worked when he was at Academy , when conditions were ideal . Now there was no indication as to whether he was receiving her emotional broadcast or not ... but he had decided to trust her . She had been right about Martin 's intentions . " What now ? " he asked . He turned to look back again , but the burning village was visible as only a column of pale smoke rising against the bright moon . " We must return to Ahd-Abbor , " said the woman . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mah-tan was to return with your dead body , Clahyh , and the road will be watched . " Again questions ! " But why ? " he asked . " What good would my death do him ? " " I do not understand the reasons . You were to be a symbol , Clahyh , a signal for Mah-tan and his fellows to rise against the people and destroy them . " The bloodbath forecast by Peter Stone . " How many of the Earthmen are with Martin and the others ? " " I know some from seeing them together , but I do not know them all . Others in the guild must know more , although many by face , not name . " Clay juggled the communicator , debating . Call Stone and warn him ? The broadcast could be heard by others , who mightp142be  --  probably were  --  of the enemy . He rejected the thought , slipping the communicator within his robes . " If we ca n't return by the main road , how are we to get back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said . " The road splits , not too many granyar from here , and we will go to the seaport . There we can take a barge up the river , slip through the walls un-seen . " " That will take clays , " he objected . " Two days , no more , if we ride all night . Come ! We have wasted enough time in chatter , Clahyh . " But even as she said it she was signaling her hakyar to kneel , untying the belt and slipping from the saddle . She tugged at the lace holding up her skirts , tossing it back to Clay ; then shrugged the dress over her head . Her naked body was gamin in the moonlight , looking like that of a young boy at one angle ; then she turned slightly , and the shape of her small breasts was accented , lifting up strongly . Then she was pulling the robes she had worn earlier from her baggage , balling the dress and throwing it to the side of the road . She dressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beast into rising again . Her heels dug into the animal 's side , and once again they were moving . Dawn found them well on the road to Des-Abbor , the land about them marshy now , the crop in the fields lining the road a water grain . They had been riding for hours when Garlan suddenlyswung into a small settlement , a dozen houses set to one side of the now-broad road . There was other traffic , of the same sort that had been heading toward Ahd-Abbor from its surroundingdistrict . Clay took a deep drink from his canteen while Garlan argued with a boy tending a dozen shoat . Iie looked up , measuring the agent 's form , and shook his head strongly . A coin was produced , bringing interest ; a second ceased the argument . With the third he went into the largest house , coming out with ap143woman who repeated his negative examination of the Earthman . The same three coins were enough to send her back inside , appearing several minutes later with an armload of clothing . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to kneel . " Those robes mark you a tool of the priests , Clahyh . You cannotwear them into Des-Abbor . " He was glad of the chance to get out of the saddle , but he took the new garments with an expression of distrust . They had obviously known many wearings , and he wondered how many natives of Karyllia they harbored now . " Hurry ! " the little woman said , impatiently . The farm wife was standing by impassively , watching with something that certainly was not interest . " The tide will turn soon , and if we miss it we will lose the clay ! " Uncomfortable with the audience , Clay stripped off his robes and donned the replacements . They were small , chafing in uncomfortableregions , and smelling of the former ownership . As he discarded his own , the farm wife picked them up one by one , and when the exchange was complete , disappeared with them into the house . They remounted , Clay 's skin crawling with the anticipation of being a Karyllian insect 's meal ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side as they continued onward . Des-Abbor was a city perhaps a tenth the size of the capital , built on a broad delta . The river Greyat broke up into hundreds of little streams that meandered through the mud flats , flooded when the rising tide sent salt water far upstream . As they neared the city Clay saw that go per cent of its houses were little more than huts , built on high stilts against the tidal flooding . The buildings that were solid were on massive pilings and deep stone foundations . The main road they were traveling was built up now , pitchcoatedpilings driven deep into the mud , the roadbed nearly ten meters above the flats . There were only a few branching streets , narrower , most of the farmer traffic turning off onto ap144broad stone-walled plaza short of the city 's center . It had obviouslybeen built over a period of thousands of years , to serve as marketplace . In the distance Clay could see the masts of sailing ships , but they did not approach the harbor . Garlan turned her hakyar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beasts to a dealer . The man was prepared to argue strongly about the price until the little woman suddenly had the point of her soul-blade touching the hollow of his throat . The merchant gulped , eyes popping , and quickly paid out her first demand . There were several larger tributaries pushing through the flats as Garlan and Clay splashed through the puddles toward a group of small barges . The water was visibly rising , the boatmenpreparing to cast off for the free ride that would carry them two-thirds of the way to Ahd-Abbor . " Would n't a sloop be wiser ? " Clay asked as Garlan approached a barge that seemed less loaded with cargo than the others . She shook her head . " They will be watched too closely by Mali-tan 's friends . By now his death must be known  --  he was supposed to report to them with the magic-voice at certain hours . We will take a barge . There are too many of them to watch . " The boatman seemed eager for passengers to supplement his cargo , but pressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clay saw that Garlan was impatient ; but there was time yet before the water would carry them from the mooring . She indulged the man , both keeping a close eye on the rising stream . The bargaining broke off , a figure agreed upon , at the exact moment when the level was high enough for the ropes to be cast free . The rising sun was bright in a cloudless sky , glaring down as the incoming tide swirled through the flats , turning the area into first a lake and then an extension of the sea . An awning had been erected over the rear half of the boat ; a young boy in the stern tended to the rudder . Clay and Garlan watched the other traffic moving into the mouth of the river for a time , then crawled beneath the shelter , finding scant space to sitp145among the cargo . They were crowded together by lack of room , Garlan 's back pressing against Clay 's ; after a moment she lay down , Clay following suit , to seek the sleep that had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's eyes opened it was night ; the late tide was running with them . There were uncountable aches and pains in his body from the uncomfortable position and from the native inhabitants of his clothing , and at some point he had shifted to his back . Garlan was pressed against his side , curled like a child , innocence in her face when he glanced down that made it difficult to recall the glee with which she had sunk the knife into Martin 's belly . She sensed his alertness , opened her eyes to the compromisingposition . She smiled , but did not move , only her eyes going to the bow where the boy was heating a fish stew over a small brazier . Several minutes passed , during which Clay felt almost at peace ; then the meal was shared out , and it was necessary to sit up to accept it . They moved quietly through the night , the only occasional sound that of a night amphibian along the shore and the constantchorus of insects over the water . There were other barges on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be silence duringthe hours of darkness . Clay dozed , then awoke to see the boy with his pole again . He shifted position slightly , Garlan 's head hurting against his upper arm , cutting off the circulation . This time he stayed awake for a long time before sleep once more captured him . Dawn found them beneath the walls of Alid-Abbor , moving through thick traffic that was heading as much south as north . Garlan was sitting up beneath the shelter , alert to the other craft and then to the shore as they came into the area of wharves . The boatman moved toward a rickety wooden clock that extended its narrow runway well out into the river , finding a place near the end to tie up . Before the boat had stopped drifting the boy was scampering up the ladder . The two passengers started out from beneath the shelter , when suddenly Garlan caught Clay 's arm , holding him back.  | " Look ! " she commanded . He followed her pointing finger to the quay , where a man in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ casually watching the river traffic , from time to time moving a few paces farther along . " I know him ! " she said . " He is one of those with Mah-tan ! "  | " David ! " Nathan was smiling , but even as he spoke Holland'sname the look on his face turned to concern as he took in the sunken eyes , the tremor in his body . " Are you all right ? " " I do n't know , " he admitted . " Let me sit . " The technician guided him to the nearest stool , one of the men vacating it for him . Nathan was shocked by the appearance of Holland , who seemed to have aged half a lifetime since the moment of his arrest . " What did they do to you , David ? " he asked . Holland held his hands apart , his head shaking ; tears were forming in his eyes , and he felt shame . But the reaction was beyond his control . He blinked , and the first tears broke free to trail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Where are we ... where is Janice ? " " In St. John , of course . Janice is safe . David , what have they done ? " A man across the table spoke : " Left him in restraint , I 'd say . How long was the cuff on you , Dr. Holland ? " He lifted a hand , let it drop . " From the moment of the trial until they brought me here this afternoon . How long was that ? " " Twenty hours or more ! " The man cursed . " And full power , from the looks of you . Somebody wants you dead ! " Holland 's eyes closed as he gave in to the weakness that washed across his body . He began to sway , then hands were grabbing either arm , helping him up . They were carrying his weight now as he passed into unconsciousness.  |p148He  opened his eyes to find a stranger seated beside his bed , booktape in hand . The slight movement as Holland turned his head caught his attention , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . How are you feeling ? " " Weak . Terribly weak . " " That 's quite understandable . You 're suffering from exhaustion , dehydration , and electrical shock . I really do n't understand how you managed to make it up from the zoo on your own . " " Where is Nathan ? " He saw that he was in a dormitory . " He 'll be back soon . " The man bent , came up with a medicalkit , putting it in position over Holland 's bare chest . There was a cool tingle as the kit read his vital signs and injected medication . " Thirsty , " said Holland . The man nodded as he removed the kit and sealed it , then reached below David 's line of vision to come up with a sealed bottle from which a straw protruded . He held it to Holland 's lips , letting him suck eagerly . " Electrolytes , Doctor . Now try to get some more sleep . " He complied , eyes closing immediately to sink into a dreamless rest . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but empty ; before he could move , Nathan and the medic came into the dormitory . They were smiling . " Feeling better , David ? " asked the technician . He blinked , checking the responses of his body . " Yes  --  much better , " he said , surprised . " You can sit up now , " said the medic . " In fact , please do , Doctor . " Their hands were there unnecessarily to help him . David shrugged them off , swinging his feet to the floor and bending forward to avoid cracking his head on the bunk above . He held out his hands , and saw that there was barely the faintest tremor . Then he stood . " Sleep is always the best medication , " said the medic , bend/ing to pick up his kit . Now David realized that he was not dressed in the drone coverall . " I 'll check in this evening , " the medic said , more to Nathan than to his patient . " I 'm sure there 'll be no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harron . " Holland waited until the man was gone , then turned anxiouslyto the technician . " Where is Janice ? " " Smuggled to safety , David . At least for the time being . We were preparing to do the same for you , but they moved too quickly after the trial . You were gone , and it was not until the next day when they delivered you here that we knew what had happened . " Holland remembered the interminable ride as a measure of the horror of the cuff . Was it all a sham ? Perhaps they had actuallysent him to another district , then returned him for some reason of their own . " How did you find me ? " " The technician in receiving sent through the word as soon as he came off duty . " " I do n't understand . This ... any of this . This is a barracks , but these men are nothing like those where they first put me . " " Wiley 's sadism , David . You were with defectives , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barracks for those unable to care for themselves at all , the incontinent and the mindless . " " But the blue warders seemed no better than the others ! " " For the most part , they are n't ; it 's not a popular assignment . The blues are after all drawn from the general drone population , David . For the most part they are no better than the masses . The exceptions have been carefully selected . " He saw the lack of comprehension and sighed . " David , you were born too high and selected too high . Sit down ; it 's time you learned the truth of our marvelous twenty-fourth-century world . " Holland did as the younger man directed , listening intently , and then with astonishment as Nathan explained the facts of modern life . " Over half Earth 's population is in the barracks , David  --  ap150total waste of not only what natural abilities might exist , but of life itself . It 's true that many of them are well below the norm of intelligence , but except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yet how many citizens do you know who have brought more than one child into the world  --  how many have brought none ? " He thought of Janice , and felt a vague guilt . There was no reason for them not to have a natural child , but the subject had never come up . They had married to provide shelter for Clay , their first successful android . Perhaps marriage would have come anyway , considering the closeness of their association ; but it had originally been a matter of convenience to their work , nothing more . " That is the reason for the regression in intelligence , David  --  nothing more ! Bad breeds bad , the defective genes multiplyingand reinforcing each other , driving out the good . If only the best were allowed to breed , you 'd see an immediate reversal of the trend . " " Population control was outlawed by the Compact , " said Holland , automatically . " Whether to have children or not is a matter of personal conscience . " " Yes , " said Nathan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the Compact was drawn . There was no population pressure to force an unpopular and distasteful weeding out of the unfit . But that no longer holds true . Unless a program is put into effect within this generation , the situation may be irre-versible . " " The androids ... " " A race of their own , David , as different from the natural race as the hominids of Karyllia and Locane ! They are men , but they do not share our ancestry  --  only the prejudices of our history . There are four races of men now , perhaps more on worlds yet to be discovered . They can co-operate  --  must cooperate , for their mutual interests  --  yet they must also remain separate and distinct , to develop their own potential without help and without hindrance . " " You 're saying the Guided Worlds policy is wrong ? "  | " It is . " He began to pace now in his animation , six short steps and then a reverse turn . " Not . for the reasons claimed by the Firsters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the right to freedom . We made a mistake fifty years ago when we began the policy . " " We ? " Holland raised an eyebrow . " Are you speaking personally , Nathan ? " " Who do you think runs the world , David ? Not the politicians ; they only govern , fill the service slots that require bureaucraticinertia to function properly . No , Earth is run by the technicians  --  hasbeen since the clays of the twentieth century . Without us , the machinery would come to a stop ; nothing would function . " " You support the technology , yes ... but do you also claim actual power ? " " We created the Reformation ists , David . And the Humanity Firsters . " The statement was the most shocking of all . Holland stared at him a moment , then shook his head . " What do you mean ? In what way did you create ' them ? " " I do n't speak of myself , " said Nathan . " Of course not , David  --  I'mnot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time of the Compact , puppet masters , if you wish . We pull the strings , people like Wiley respond . Few of us have high position , for we do n't wish to become obvious in our control . The puppets might revolt . " " The Reformationists are founded in madness , " said Holland , slowly . " Why are they necessary ? " " Because the Compact is strangling Earth ! For three centuriesthe planet has been bound by the provisions of that long ago agreement which was based upon the political necessities that came from the Bad Years . Earth has changed in those centuries , David . Our needs are different from those of the men who wrote the Compact and sealed it . Yet in those three centuriesnot one word of the original has been changed . New sectionshave been added to deal with new situations that did notp152then exist , but the social structure of the planet has been straitjacketedfor three hundred years . " " The Compact must be changed ? " " Not changed , David  --  scrapped ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is necessary to plant the seed of change early . That is why the android project was proposed to the President thirty years ago . Even then it was obviously a blind alley , but it was a small violation that could lead the way to greater changes . " Wiley is our man completely , " he said , sitting on the edge of the bed . Ten seconds later he was up again , and pacing . " Once the Reformationists take over the government he will introduce a resolution to study the genetic defects of the race . From that , it is just a step to the course that has been needed from the beginning . " Holland felt a sinking sensation in his gut . He reached out to grab Nathan 's arm , forcing the younger man to stop , to meet his eyes . " Did you reveal the Project to Wiley ? " " No , David . But if it had been necessary , I would have . 11ie President saved me from the betrayal . He has been studying the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foolish enough to record the details of the Project . Perhaps each new President should have been informed , but it was n't felt necessary . Shocked by the violation of the Compact , he called in Wiley . " It was n't much , but it was a personal satisfaction . Still , it was tempered by the knowledge that thirty years of his life had been spent in a charade devised by others . " What happens now ... to me ? " " Tor the moment you are safe here , David . We use this ward as a cover  --  nearly a hundred of the men work for us , knowing that in time they 'll be selected as blues . It is n't much , but it 's better than a lifetime in the barracks . " He shook his head . " Waste ! Over a billion human beings , useless no matter what their abilities . The planet is too small , David , and we ca n't send more than a fraction of them intep153space . The population must be cut in half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; if so , then it will be cut again . It will be , David ; it must be ! If Earth collapses into barbarism , the planet can not support another climb from the beginning . Only technology can support continued superior life . " " I want to see Janice , " said Holland . " Can you make the ar-rangements ? " " Tomorrow . There will be a sweep for another Firster dem-onstration . " David nodded , satisfied . " What of my future ? What plans do you have for me ? I do n't want to spend the rest of my years here . " " So long as the Reformationists hold the government you will have to remain hidden . Once the Compact is set aside , things may change , but for now it will be best to get you off the planet entirely . " Holland thought that his capacity for surprise had been filled to surfeit by Nathan 's revelations , but this new idea made him blink . " Leave Earth ? " " Karyllia would be best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ managed to put down the Reformationists . " He seemed embarrassed . " In this instance we appear to have created a Frankenstein 's monster , David . The psychometricians miscalculated the level of xenophobia present in the human mind . Originally it was a survival instinct , but the gene passing it has never been isolated . " " Clay is on Karyllia . " " I know , David . " His voice softened . " I also know that lie was the first successful android . " " Only Janice knew that . There are times when I forget myself . He is my son , Nathan , no matter what the means of his birth . Our son . " " You ca n't force his future , David . You ca n't make him sometinng that he is not . Ile must be told , and lie must choose for himself . " Nathan placed his hand on Holland 's shoulder . " The secretp154of Clay 's birth was in the diaries released to Wiley , David . The Firsters know what he is . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter what happens on Karyllia . It is best that you and Janice join him there . " " If he lives , " Holland said , bitterly . The next morning the word passed quickly through the barracksof the upcoming sweep . Holland was reminded of a childhoodouting he 'd once taken with a group of other children in his school class , the eagerness and anticipation as great . The emotion was one he shared now . They were marched in a group to the drop shafts , for the first time an inkling of his location revealed . They had been high in the tower ; it took a long time for the shaft to deliver them to ground level , where they were loaded in buses and lifted into the air . He craned to see out of the window , orientinghimself to the city ; the barracks were north of Government Center , site of the demonstration . They were not the first to arrive ; already there were more than a thousand drones assembled , receiving final instructions as team leaders passed among them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nathan , for Janice , for any familiar face ; but there were only those who had come with him in the sweep . At last they were ready , assembled into a form of order . The signal was given , and they marched toward the government buildings several blocks distant . The sign in David 's hand was a flasher , its alternating red and green proclaiming " Earth for Earthmen ! " over and over . He felt hemmed in by the mass of humanity as they moved closer to their goal ; even the barracks had n't been this bad . Then they were there , a sound car moving slowly ahead of them  --  slowly enough that they managed to overtake it . In five minutes David was abreast of it , glancing idly at the sealed windows . The door beside him irised opened , the interior darkened so that he could see only a vague shape in the far corner as hep155glanced in . He started to pass by , when suddenly the person spoke . " David ! " He stopped , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been anticipating her voice . A quick glance around showed that the team leader was concentrating on something ahead ; he ducked through the door , which immediatelyclosed again , the interior lights coming on . " Janice ! " She smiled , holding out her hands . He moved forward , then realized that he was still holding the picket . It was impossible to ignore as both sides flashed the message , but lie shoved it into the corner , then embraced his wife . " Thirty years wasted ! " he said , a moment later . " Not wasted , David . It served a very important purpose . Even if it had not , the idea of research in itself has high value . The Project did solve the problem it was given . " " You knew from the beginning ? " " Yes . I was one of the committee that originally proposed the Project . We fed it to Charles , let him carry it to the Presi-dent . " " Did he know the real purpose of the charade ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything to show him the necessity of our program . " " Then I was the only fool ! " He slumped back into the seat , staring at his hands as they fell between his knees . Janice reached to touch him , gently . " You are not a fool , David . Never a fool . You were given the information necessary to develop a program that could lead to the ending of the Compact , and you served with the highest ability . " They were silent together for a moment , hands meeting , the contact between flesh and flesh reassuring to the man . But Holland could not forget that he had lived thirty years of blind service to a falsehood . " Knowing the reason for the regression , " he said , " why did you never have a child of our own , Janice ? "  | " I tried , " she said , her voice so low that it was difficult to hear over the rush of sound surrounding the conditioned car . " Tor years I tried , David @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failures . In time I stopped trying . Clay may be android , but he is our son . That will never change . " The car lurched to a stop , throwing them both forward . He helped her catch her balance , and then held her close again . When they at last parted he saw the tears in her eyes , touched them with his finger . " They want us to leave Earth , Janice . " She smiled again , blinking . " Why stay ? Our work here is done . If we can go to Karyllia , we 'll have a whole new planet with nothing but projects that need directing , David . The futureis there now , at least for us . " It was a comforting thought , spoiled only by his knowledge that , unlike themselves , Clay was in danger of his life .. . If he still lived.  |p157Clay  studied the white-robed Terran a moment , recognizing his face . The man was unmistakably watching the water traffic , his eyes passing with apparent idleness over every boat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arm , pointing farther along the quay to where another white robe was standing . " How do we get by them ? " he asked . " Wait , Clahyh . " The boatman watched curiously as she slipped from beneath the awning , moving as agilely as the boy before her . The priest saw her head appear over the dock , watching without recognitionas she finished the climb and sauntered slowly toward him . Then she was past , disappearing into a narrow alley . As the minutes passed slowly Clay saw the boatman 's boy returning with a factor in tow , the man obviously bored by the whole affair of trading . He came out to the end of the clock , standing there while the boy scrambled back down the ladder to begin a desultory conversation with the boatman . They began to argue back and forth , neither showing that his heart was in it , while the boy pulled samples out of the various piles . Clay listened for a few minutes , but grew bored . He looked back at the wharf and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tugging at his robe  --  and Clay recognized Garlan in another change of clothing , her pigtail now dangling sloppily over one ear . The priest glanced down , annoyed , as Garlan 's head bobbed animatedly . A question was asked , and she pointed toward the alley ; even from the boat Clay saw the suspicion on the agent'sp158face . He looked toward his fellow just within his sight while Garlan renewed her plea . At last he shrugged , and turned to follow her scampering lead . They reached the alley , the agent stopping to bark another question at Garlan , who was already slipping into the narrow and dark way . She said something that angered the man ; he started to reach for her , moving into the alley a pace or two ... and from nowhere two men appeared behind him , their shoulders jerking with a sudden violent movement . The Earthman started to turn , his head snapping back in shock ... and then he was sagging , caught before he could collapseand dragged farther into the alley by the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glances in each direction ; satisfied that the deed had been unobserved by anyoneon the quay , she came toward the dock , Clay already on the ladder . He stopped halfway up when the communicator spoke in his ear : " Barrett ? Is that you , Barrett ? " Garlan had stopped when she saw him emerge . Now he came up to peer carefully over the top of the clock . The other agent was taking an uncertain step this way as he slipped over , shrugging and stooping to minimize his height . " Barrett ! Answer me , man ! Where are you ? " Garlan had turned , was a dozen paces ahead of him when Clay reached the quay . He caught her at the mouth of a street , pausing there just long enough to glance at the Earthman , who was a few steps closer , looking about in confusion . He was payingthem no particular attention , however , even when he made up his mind and began to walk that way . He would find the dead man in another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? There was no sign of the assassins . " Fellow thieves ? " asked Clay . " A summons from the soul-blade can not be denied , " she said . They pushed through streets as narrow as the alley , the way as twisting and turning as when Martin had led him on a merryp159chase . Several times they saw white robes , some of whom Garlanrecognized as Martin 's fellows . When that happened they ducked back , taking another way . Clay kept his attention on the communicator , but there was no outcry from the dock area . " I must reach the leader of all priests , " he said once when they had ducked through a bazaar , stopping for a moment in a shaded garden court that seemed peaceful and still . Then the owner 's servant appeared at the door , shrilling at them to be away . " Mah-tan 's fellows are everywhere , " she said . " You can not dare the temple . " " I must see him ! " he insisted . Doubtful , she asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I will bring him to you . " It was said with such assurance that he did not doubt her . But obviously she had changed her mind about the course they were following ; now they cut through side streets , coming at last to a seedy tavern in a district best described as disreputable . There were a score of idlers lounging about the tables as they entered , all of them ugly , none of them in pleasant mood . They stared at the newcomers as Garlan moved to the kitchen to speak to the innkeeper . Then she gestured , and Clay followed her through the tavern to the back of the building where rickety outside steps led to the upper stories . She started up , the wood creaking and shaking alarmingly when Clay put his weight on the first step . But it held , and he followed her . The second story was obviously of a different construction than the first , and the third and fourth of other periods yet . There was no landing , just a door opening off the stairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slipped in behind her . The room was windowless , lit only by a few smoking oil lamps . Clay blinked at the change , making out a few more of the tavern tables and vague shapes around them . Then as his eyes adjusted , he made out their features . He started to speak , but Garlan turned swiftly , her hand going across his face.  | " Here you will be silent , Clahyh , until invited to speak ! " " A stranger ? " asked a voice from the darkest corner . Then he cursed : " He is one of them ! " He came to his feet , burly for a Karyllian and broader through the shoulder than Clay . But he was half a head shorter , his legs bowed widely as he moved , his hand bringing out his knife . " No ! " cried Garlan . " This is the one they hate  --  the one they call android . " For a moment the word passed Clay 's notice , distracted by the other problems . Then his ears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it out . Android ? What did they mean ? Androids were forbidden under the Compact . Tension held for a moment , and then the burly one sheathed his weapon . " You should not have brought him here , Garlan . It is too dangerous . " " He can help , " she said , strongly . " Not all of the white robes are enemy , Burrus . " " Then why do they hide in their false robes behind their false gods ? What do they want ? " Clay watched Garlan look at him , the deep wells of her eyes catching the flickering lamplight and sending it back . At the moment she seemed very much a woman , despite her clothes and despite her surroundings . He wondered which element was strongest now ... woman , or thief ? " Can you answer ? " she asked . He chose his words carefully , trying to find phrases that would not antagonize the short-tempered audience . There was doubt in their attitude , the natives unable to understand the idea of philanthropy for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and at last the burly man shrugged . " You speak of fools , android . We thieves have fattened on fools since the first purse was worn . " " Martin and the others enlisted your help for the promise of treasure ... a treasure you would never enjoy . I offer you life ! " " Which we have now . " " And which you can lose in darkness , never knowing death isp161near until your lungs choke , your food no longer nourishes you , the water you drink poisons you ! " " We must help them ! " said Garlan . " I do not wish to die without honor , Burrus ! " The other argued for another ten minutes , but at last he was beaten down . He retired to his corner , dismissing her from his presence . " Do as you must , Garlan . Any foolish enough may join you , but I think you 're mad . " Satisfied , she began to strip out of her clothing , going naked to a large chest in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watching her body as she grunted against the plank lid of the chest , finally raising it ; then she dived into the haphazard bundles of clothing within , coming up with a dress that would let her pass muster as a temple servitor . She smiled at Clay as she donned it , then combed out her hair . He saw her slip her knife into place beneath the clothing , and then an old woman 's cowled cloak hid the dress from pryingeyes . A moment later she was gone , leaving Clay in the company of the thieves . Who ignored him . Which left him nothing but his thoughts as occupation . After a time he activated the communicator , increasing the gain , but could pick up no hint of activity in the streets outside . Even when lie brought out the instrument Garlan had confiscated from Martin , he could get nothing . The temple and the space station were silent . Now the tag she had given him came back to taunt . Clay dredged his mind for the information it held about androids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact that they had been outlawed by the Compact . There was something terrible in the connotation , but he knew no more . He certainly was n't android ! An hour dragged slowly , each minute ticked off on his mentalclock ; and then a second . The best part of the third was gone as well before a change occurred . During that time severalp162of the men in the room had left , singly , while others had come in . All ignored him . When the door opened again he glanced up , expecting no more than another of the thieves . There were other women in the room now ; for a time they had been in the majority . Then he recognized Garlan and sat up straight as she brought in a street beggar whose robes were barely more than rags . The beggar blinked against the dimness , but Clay had alreadyrecognized Stone . He jumped to his feet , moving to greet him . " Clay ! It is you  --  this woman said Martin is dead ! " He nodded , looked at Garlan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Only that you were here , Clahyh . And in danger . " " Then you 'd better sit down , Peter . " Stone followed the suggestion , listening intently to everythingClay said . When the youth finished the man turned to Garlan . " All thieves are in alliance with the Reformationists ? " She stared blankly , and he added , " Martin and his fellows ? " Garlan looked to Burrus , who had gone out twice during her absence , each time returning after a few minutes . Now she was deferring to his position . " We hold no alliances , " he said gruffly . " You aided them , " pointed out Stone . " We served for pay , no more . We owe them nothing . " " We owe them our soul-blades ! " the little woman said , fiercely . " Phey lied to us , Burrus ! Will you lie down in the street to be trampled by their hakyar ? " The thief-leader scowled , Clay wondering if she had puncturedhis pride too deeply . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at her , when Stone put another question that distracted his anger . " How many thieves are there in Ahd-Abbor ? " Burrus blinked , looked quickly at several of the other men . " As many as there are stars in the sky ! " " I doubt that , " Stone said , calmly . The night sky of Karyllia was far richer than Earth 's in stellar census . " Nor do I carep163what crimes your people may have committed against the citizensof this city . You have worked with the men who plot to destroy your race , Burrus  --  not just some , not even many , but all Karyllians will die if they have their way ! Thieves among them ! " He bent suddenly , touching the heel of his boot , then straightened to toss something against the wall . Clay was on his feet in horror , crying out . " No , do n't ! " The grenade bounced off the wall , hitting on the floor , at last self-destructing . A little cloud of white vapor boiled up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breath and rushed forward to sweep Garlan away . But the gas moved swiftly , the thieves coughing and hacking and pawing at their eyes . Stone stood , back of his hand over his face , and moved to open the door . Tears stung Clay 's eyes as he saw that the thieves still lived , the gas only one of the training samples . It lacked even the regurgitant . " That is what will happen to you , Burrus , if the Reformationistsare not stopped . Except they will not use something mild enough to bring only tears . " Clay thought the thieves were ready to tear Stone apart , but the other knew what he was doing . The example was graphic , penetrated instantly in a way that they could not argue away as they had with Clay 's earlier words . " If we help you , you will give us the poison clouds ? " Burrus asked , warily . " To use against your innocent fellows ? " Stone shook his head . " No , Burrus . You 've protection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reward you , however  --  if life itself is not reward enough . What pay were you promised by the others ? " " The riches of the temple , after you were all dead . " It was Stone 's turn to blink , but his face remained impassive . " Do you believe now that they intend to reward you in the way they promised ? " Again scowling , Burrus glanced at Garlan , then at several ofp164the others , seeking support . The little woman was fiercely on the side of the Earthmen ; the others showed their uncertainty by looking away . " What will you give ? " " Riches enough to keep you in comfort the rest of your days . Treasure to make you a man among the greatest men of AhdAbbor . For your people , a thousand measures of silver . " " Each ? " he insisted . " Of course . " He nodded . " Very well , man of another world . Seal it in blood . " He drew his knife , drawing a line from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forearm . For an instant the line was white against his flesh ; then the blood welled up dark and rich . He wiped his hand through it as Stone drew a knife of his own , repeatingthe operation , his face impassive . He followed the Karyllian in every way , reaching out to clasp hands with him . Burrus ground their palms together , mixing their blood , then held his hand up to show the red smear . Again Stone did the same . " The others also swore in blood , " said Burrus , softly . " You know that they lied . What is the price of breaking the oath ? " " Death ! " It was barely a whisper . " I care not for your riches , Earthman . A thief can steal the riches he needs . I have tested you only because this one insists that there are men of honor among you despite the evidence . " He indicated Garlan with a twist of his head . " If she is wrong  --  if you also lie  --  then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life of every thief ! " Clay was conscious that he had been holding his breath . He let it out with a rush , clasping Stone 's shoulder in relief . " Good ! We 're in agreement with the guild , Peter  --  but what do we do ? How will we take them without alerting the lot ? " He guild will do it for us , " said Stone . It was night when they reached the central square , whichp165was lit now only by the torches in front of the Terran temple and the ancient citadel . The fire cauldrons burned balefully in the eyes of the Sanctum , but there was no illumination from that source . Despite the darkness there was much traffic circulating through the square . Clay was reassured by the knowledge that much of it was there in support of him , but he felt foolhardy nevertheless as they moved toward the temple , Stone and Garlanwith him . The two Earthmen paused fifty meters short of the steps as they saw a white-robed priest come out of the temple , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burning at the other end of the square . IIe paid no attention to the natives drifting by , knowing that mendicants were being bedded down for the night on the floor . " Do you know him , Garlan ? " asked Stone , softly . She shrugged . " I think so . " She moved toward the steps , hurryingup them to stand just below the priest , tugging at his robe . He glanced down , irritated . " If your belly is empty , boy , the kitchen is still open . " " Mah-tan is dead ! " she said . " ' Meat ? " He reached out to grab her shoulder . " Show me your badge ! " She slipped her knife out so that he could see the blade , and he nodded . " The other did it , " she added . " The one they call android . " " Where is he now ? " he demanded . But Garlan had turned , was hurrying back the way she had come . The agent cursed , started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind , following her . Clay held his breath , expecting to hear a warning cry over the communicator ; but there was nothing , even when he reached the bottom step and moved out . Suddenly there was a knife at the priest 's ear , the point pushingthrough the tiny circle to shatter the communicator before it could be activated . Clay thought lie heard the briefest part of an in-drawn breath , but it might only have been his own.  |p166A  dozen natives were around the agent now , bearing him down , other knives threatening any movement to protect himself . They were stripping his robes away , pulling his boots from his feet , a woman bundling them together and wrapping them in a cloth to cover the white . She hurried off , brushing past Clay and Stone as they converged on an alley toward which the naked agent was now being hurried . They met him there , carryinghim into darkness ... but not before he saw their faces . " Now ! " Stone touched Burrus ' shoulder and the tip of the thief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agent 's throat . " You 'll talk , Worrel , or you 'll never see the light of anothermorning . " The man choked . " You 're insane ! The Compact ! " " No , the insanity is elsewhere . And the Compact is dead , destroyedby your scheming . The Reformationists may have Earth , but they will not have Karyllia ! I honored the Compact , but Martin is dead and there will be more if you fail to answer my questions . Burrus ! " Again the point of the blade pressed farther , causing blood to spurt ; it trickled warmly down the agent 's throat . He knew that he was as close to death as he would ever be while still breathing . " How many of the agents are Reformationists ? " " Less than half .. . I do n't know the exact number ! " His eyes were rolled toward the thief master . " Most of them are out in the field , not here . " " How many in the temple ? Their names ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at first and then more , after several pauses , until he had called off a dozen in all . Barrett was one of them ; Clay wondered if the man 's body would ever be found . " That 's all . .. all I can remember . Ahhhh ! " Now Garlan 's knife was touching him , moving to the most tender place . She twisted the blade , exerting pressure , Burrus never letting up on his own . " If he lies , let him live  --  as less than a man ! "  | " Please , no ! " He was begging Stone now . " Please , I 've told you the truth . What more do you want from me ? " Clay was sickened by this deed as the man continued to blubber , pleading for mercy . He started to turn away , but Stone had more questions . " How many on the space station , Worrel ? " There were fewer names this time , no more than a few of the hundred manning the station . Most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ named Clay recognized only two as coming from that rank . One of them , however , was the medic who had given him the final check before releasing him to the surface . Stone was satisfied . " I think he is telling the truth , Clay . Lacking the probe , though , there 's only one way to test his story . " Burrus grunted . " You are finished with this one ? " " Not yet . Worrel , what signal do you have to warn each other of danger , and what will signal the attack on the native population ? " Worrel gasped again , once more feeling pressure from both blades . " The signal is Come First ! ' As to the attack , word is expected on the next ship from Earth . " Stone was startled . " Due within hours ! " " Yes  --  aggghhhh ! Please , Stone , make them stop ! " " What means ? " " A plague strain , distributed into the water supplies of the various districts . It will generate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immunized against it . " " Where is the agent ? " " Already distributed to the various districts , but I do n't know who in each area has charge  --  I do n't ! I 'm not assigned to that part . Maybe the medic  --  I named him , did n't I ? " " It makes sense . " Stone looked at Clay , nodding . " A viral reagent , and there 's no better place to store biologicals than with other biologicals . The medic is almost always the only one to know what he carries in his kit . " He looked back to the hapless captive . " All right , Worrel ,  |p168you  're going on ice . You should be thankful to be alive  --  you wo n't be , if we find that you have in any way lied . " " I have n't , Stone ! So help me ! " " We are ... even though it 's more than you people seem willing to do for the Karyllians . " He sighed , turning away , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of guilt weighing him down . Burrus let his eyes flick from the captive to Stone . " Now you 're through ? " he asked . " Yes . " " Good ! " Burrus pressed his point farther , the razor-sharp obsidianslicing through cartilage , arteries , and veins alike . The blood spurted freely , the dead man giving a final gurgle as the last air trapped in his lungs escaped through the new opening in his windpipe . Before the convulsive final shudder was through , the natives holding the corpse let it drop , the halfseveredhead hitting the cobblestones like an overripe melon . " Was that necessary ? " demanded Stone , horrified . The only answer to come from Burrus was another grunt , contemptuous . He turned toward the mouth of the alley , the temple visible only a short distance beyond . Now they had to enter it.  |p169As  David Holland returned to the barracks with his fellow drones he carried his wife 's final words , a warning that it would not be safe for them to meet again until Nathan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the safest place for him was in the barracks . " And you ? " be asked . " I 'm staying in a rose tower . " She smiled . " It 's like being young again , David . I 'd forgotten the inconveniences and adjustmentsyou have to make . But I 'm doing all right for a spoiled old rich lady . " Nathan was there as well , new ID covering most of the staff ; be was the only one who found it necessary to travel . When David asked for the same , he was told that his face was too well known , thanks to the trial , which had concentrated on him almost to the exclusion of his tools . There was n't time to arrange a facial restructuring , and if he was spotted by a citizen it would double the difficulties for everyone . " Besides , " said Nathan , " there are worse punishments than the barracks , David . " " I ca n't imagine them . " " The Jovian moons , for one . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minds go first , and they almost always suicide . " " I 've considered the idea , " said Holland . " Do n't . Your life is not over . Whichever side wins on Karyllia , the Guided Worlds policy is as dead as the Compact . There 's work for you there  --  why , man , there 's need for a thousandprojects ! "  | " And if the Reformationists win ? " " Then there are the colonies . A man with your qualifications would be welcomed anywhere , even if you were a multiple ax murderer . " And so he settled into the routine of barracks life , each day exactly like that which had preceded , a foretaste of that to follow . There were the booktapes , although he had never developed the habit of reading as an end in itself , for no other reason than pleasure . There were also men intelligent enough to stimulate the conversations , although he found out soon enough that their life experiences were so different there were almost no common meeting grounds . It was as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ routine was beneficial as he adjusted to a regularschedule , rising each day at a certain hour , eating at regulartimes , retiring each night at the same moment . Janice had always made sure that his meals were balanced , that all essentialswere included ; but now mealtime became an event of inportance , each a break in the monotony . The food was always basic ration , unimaginatively prepared , but he managed to savor the most commonplace tastes , finding in each a depth of experience that required exploration . He had to explore ; it helped consume a few more of the gray minutes . There were other sweeps , the Firsters stepping up the level of their activity as the government 's position became shakier ; soon they would be able to force the new election that they wanted . But David was told to stay behind , lest one of his former antagonistsspot his presence . None of the activity spilled over onto the public channel , which varied not a bit in its bloody activities . On Nathan 's next visit David asked why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public channel , " was the reply . " We want to keep the drones in control , not hype them up to where they march against the government . It is possible to stampede even sheep with the proper stimulus , David . "  | " Why this constant exposure to violence ? " he shuddered as Doc Arko sliced up another nubile young female . " A safety valve . A psychometrician could give you the technicalwords , but surrogate violence releases sexual tension and stems the growth of emotional overcharges . " " But what is to prevent them from acting out what they have seen ? " " Nothing , I suppose . It just does n't work that way . The repressedpersonality , the true ax-murderer type , is the one who has no such outlet . Since the drones are under what amounts to a lifetime of repression , they are given a strong dose in their en-tertainments . " Sex was another matter that was carefully regulated , scheduledweekly . Held under the cover of a social meeting , David went along with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eagerly at the blue warder 's announcement to be ready . The fifty or sixty who opted against socializing were far gone in their narcotic fantasies as they suckled their joy juice bottles . They were marched to one of the female wards on this same level , where more than half of the men immediately paired off with women who were obviously old weekly friends . There was music , and the dining tables were lined with the sort of snacks Holland remembered from childhood picnics ; but few of the visitors were interested in food at that point . Almost immediatelythe dormitory was in use . Holland wandered for most of the three hours of the meeting , finding that sitting was an invitation to an approach from one of the unpaired women . A few of them were pleasant enough to look upon , but they were placid , even bovine . After a lifetime with Janice he found them as dreary as the rest of the drone existence . It was a relief to escape back to his own ward when the signalcame , even though most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went again . The routine became familiar , became a way of life that was almost normal as the days slid into weeks , and even the weeks slid by with a crashing sameness . He lost track of the date veryp172quickly , forced to ask Nathan on his rare visits . Each time he asked also if there was news from Karyllia , and each time the technician shook his head . It was a deadening existence for a man whose entire life had been his work . Holland had never even thought about the fourhouror six-hour work period that was normal for most of the world . He spent as much time as necessary at his tasks , relaxing briefly only while making the necessary adjustment to a new problem . For him and Janice , socializing had been almost entirelypolitical , their only friends the people working on the Project , or hangovers from early life such as Letermeister and a handful of others . He could not play games ; there was no challengein defeating someone else in a contest that had no meaningin real life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his life . The weeks became a month , and then a second , and he missed Janice with a pain that was growing almost unbearable . He found himself watching the programming on the public channel not with interest , but at least as something to distract his mind ; he even began to plan ways for Doc Arko to improve his record of carnage . . . Nathan came one evening , seeming unusually harried ; his eyes kept glancing nervously from face to face , even to the screen . " We 've unleashed the hurricane , David , and it does not seem that it can be brought under control . Even Wiley and his people are scared  --  the Firsters are almost completely out of hand . It may be that we 'll have to cut off space flight for a few years . " " Why ? " " To stop the Firsters from taking over the ships and sending nukes to the star worlds . " " What about our own people ? " " There will be no problem with Karyllia and Locane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nicely . The colonies will not have so easy a time of it . They depend on Earth , al/though we 're studying now to see if we can support them from Karyllia . " He slumped in a chair , utterly weary , running a hand through already rumpled hair . For a moment his eyes closed , his features lined with pain . When he opened them again it was to blink , as though in his exhaustion he had forgotten where he was . " We do n't have much time , David  --  a week ; perhaps even less . All starships will be dispatched from Prime Station as soon as the technicians ' council has the data to permit a final decision . We 're going to have to move you and Janice to Prime Station  --  probably within the next twenty-four hours . I may not be the one to come for you , so be ready for whatever happens . " " Have you heard from Karyllia ? " he demanded . " Yes ...  |p174The  thieves went first , Clay and Stone holding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those of the guild who had preceded them earlier . The two agents stayed in the shadows along the walls , moving in the direction of the kitchen with Burrus . There was only one white robe in the area , loungingagainst the wall in apparent disinterest although his eyes continually flicked toward the entrance . After a moment he straightened , started casually in that direction as Stone touched Clay 's arm to signal that the man was one of those named by Worrel . Suddenly Garlan came darting from the side , brushing past the white-robed priest just as he reached the entrance , glancing off his side . Startled , the man cursed , turning to scream at her ... as three of the thieves came from behind to strike at the same instant , their soul-blades drinking vital blood . They caught him before he could fall and carried hirn to the darkest corner , covering him with a native robe as curious eyes followed them briefly , then quickly became disinterested . In no more than ten seconds the dead man was one among scores of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Stone muttered , almost to himself . " I do n't like it . " " They 're asleep , " said Clay . " They should n't be . " They moved into the corridor that circled through the walls of the building , Garlan slipping off her own outer robe to becomeonce more a servitor . Clay found his cell . He ducked in to find his belongings , which he had stored on the shelf be/neath the bed when he left on his trip with Martin . He quickly changed , becoming once more one of the servants to the white robes , pulling the cowl over his head . He saw Stone slip grenadesfrom each heel and did the same . They slipped back into the corridor , only the three of them now ; Burrus and the others were waiting in the main temple , the guild leader with Martin 's communicator already tuned . At a signal from Stone or Clay they would invade the lower regionsin full force . Clay saw a white robe round the turn of the passageway and stiffened ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nodding at the agent-in-charge as he passed . Still the youth 's spine was crawling with the anticipation of a strike from unexpected quarters . A moment later they were descending , following the twists and turns designed to confuse , both Clay and Stone now wishingthat the precautions had been simpler . Several of the passagesdoubled back upon themselves , while others became culde-sacsunexpectedly . Stone hoped Burrus could remember the detailed instructions lie had given . Another priest turned a comer , coming toward them with furrowed brow . He glanced at Stone without a word  --  then recognizedClay even with the cowl over his head . Startled , he stopped . " Holland ! I did n't know you were due back . Where is Martin ? " " In his cell , " said Clay , hoping that his voice sounded casual . " He twisted his ankle ; I 'm going to send the medic to him now . " The explanation was accepted , although the lines remained in the man 's face . He started past them with a nod , Stone turning to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the base of the man 's skull in a chop that sent him sprawling . Immediately Garlan was upon him , her knife ready to slice across his throat .. , until Stone caught her , pulled her away.
