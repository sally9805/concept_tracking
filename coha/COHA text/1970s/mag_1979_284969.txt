When Dick Serafin left his TIME office in Chicago , the weather reports were forecasting only a light snowfall . <P> That prospect did not faze him at all . As TIME 'S Chicago production and distribution manager , he is used to coping with the challenges of his city 's winters . But Serafin awoke the next morning to find nearly a foot of snow on the ground , with more coming . " It was snowing so heavily , " he recalls , " that I could n't see the end of my block . I was completely surprised-and very worried . " <P> Understandably so . Every weekend the pages of TIME are composed on film at Chicago 's R.R. Donnelley &; Sons Co. printing plant , and a set of negatives is flown to each of our other seven printing plants throughout the U.S. and seven more scattered around the world . If the film packets leave Chicago late , special efforts must be made to overcome the delay . What 's more , some four-color ad pages are printed in Chicago and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final copies . <P> As the storm worsened , Serafin ordered five trailer trucks to leave for their destinations ahead of schedule . Then he and his staff chartered three Learjets for Sunday in case the blizzard knocked out the regular commercial airlines that normally carry the films of the editorial pages . It did . When the blizzard finally blew itself out , there were 30 in. of snow on the ground and O'Hare International Airport was closed . <P> But Pal-Waukee Airport , 30 miles away , began operating Sunday afternoon , and so did Meigs Field , a small facility on Chicago 's lakefront . Serafin had a helicopter leased at Meigs and flew the film to Pal-Waukee , where the waiting Learjets immediately departed . Serafin was also finally able to get the ads through by truck , and the Jan. 22 issues , bearing the cover picture of Soviet Party Chief Leonid Brezhnev , rolled off the presses on schedule nearly everywhere . <P> It had been a close call , the closest that Serafin , a 13-year veteran of TIME , or his fellow workers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the magazine would come out , " he says . " We were just too determined to succeed . " <P> Such feats of improvisation , however , will soon be the stuff of nostalgia , tales to be recounted around a warm computer on a snowy weekend . Later this year TIME will start transmitting text and pictures electronically to its printing plants , a technological advance that will help our readers get the latest fast-breaking news , no matter how much it may storm in Chicago or anywhere around the world .
