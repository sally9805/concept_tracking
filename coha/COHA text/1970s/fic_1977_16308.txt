TWO QUOTES TWO QUOTES PRE-CREDITS Film opens with two FADE-IN FADE-OUT quotes : white letters against a black field . There is NO SOUND . FIRST QUOTE In the first two years after repatriation , 53.4 percent of the deaths of WWII ex-POWs held in the Orient were attributed to violent causes : murder , suicide , in the act of crime or on the highway . This was a violent death rate four times the normal expectancy .  - -  From the report by the Committee on Veterans Medical Problems , September , 1954 SECOND QUOTE Our returning prisoners-of-war are examples of the high moral fiber. . . which will help make this a nation . . . free from crime .  - -  Richard M.

" Go Hide John " is an upbeat , hard-driving song , full of violence and vengeance . In the song Sovine , a sixtiesh redneck singer with a sandpaper voice , belts out the anger of a returning soldier . When he sings " But I 'm alive ! " his voice literally ripples with defiance . The credits are interspersed in a long emotional sequence and hopefully we 'll be able to play all of the lyrics of " Go Hide John " ( the song runs 2:45 ) . In any event , the lyrics are worth listening to : " GO HIDE JOHN " " Thank you , Operator . ( a beat ) Hello , Marie ? It 's me . I 'm back . Go Hide John . I 'm gon na get him .

A cluster of high-ranking AF anxiously stand by . A pushing crowd of wives , children and relatives strains for the first glimpse of the returning prisoners . Some are nervously talkative , some are impatiently silent ; all are nearing a frenzy of anticipation . Home-made SIGNS are sprinkled through the crowd . They read : WELCOME HOME BEAUTIFUL MEN ! WE 'RE ALL PROUD OF YOU JESUS LOVES YOU OUR HEROES ! Finally , the giant steel door slowly opens . A CHEER goes up . A POW cautiously sticks his head out of the plane . The crowd , as if through some secret signal , begins singing , " God Bless America " in unison . The first POW walks down the ramp . He is greeted enthusiastically by the AF representative .

" The returning POWs look gaunt , worn , but in good health . Then , stepping off the plane , appears LT . COLONEL CHARLES RANE , " our hero . " He instantly catches our eye . Tough , individualistic , unsmiling . About 35-45 . He makes apologies to no man . Passing through the reception line he is enthusiastically greeted by his wife JANET and twelve-year-old son MARK . Janet quickly introduces Mark and Rane , since they do not instantly recognize each other . CLIFF , wearing a policeman 's uniform , stands in the crowd watching them closely .

END CREDITS CUT TO :  --  6  --  Section Details THE INTERVIEW THE INTERVIEW Charles Rane and AF Colonel WILLIAM MAXWELL are seated behind microphones on a long interview table . A banner behind their heads reads : CORPUS CHRISTI WELCOMES HOME LT . COL . CHARLES RANE Name plates on the table identify Rane and Maxwell . Rane 's sky-blue uniform is draped with a multi-colored assortment of medals and decorations . More medals are placed in an orderly row on the table before him . Col. Maxwell acts only in an advisory capacity . As Rane 's Air Force psychiatrist , he is assigned to help " talk him down " during this transition period . The CAMERA remains STATIC throughout the interview . It does not pan or zoom ; we do not see the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throughout the interview . He tries to be cooperative but really is n't equipped to handle these kind of intellectual questions yet . He seems to have lost the knack of normal conversation . The unmoving camera emphasizes his uneasiness . Questions jump out of nowhere , anonymous TV cameras grind behind banks of lights , flashbulbs pop erratically . The tenor of the interview indicates that Rane has been back home at least a couple weeks . &nbsp; REPORTER 1 ( O.S. ) How the folks in Corpus been treating you , Colonel Rane ? Rane has a delayed reaction . It seems to take him a few extra seconds to respond to anything . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL CHARLES RANEGood . Yeah . Good . &nbsp; REPORTER 2 ( O.S. ) How does it feel to be back home after seven years in Hanoi ? &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL CHARLES RANE ( pause ) Nice .

Jack Abel told reporters that you were strung upside down for three days by the North Vietnamese . Is that true ? Col.

That was just another fiction . &nbsp; REPORTER 8 ( O.S. ) Do you blame the GIs who made anti-war statements ? Rane hesitates for a moment and looks at Col. Maxwell . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL CHARLES RANEWell , I do n't know what to say about that . I only did what I felt I must . ( looks back at Maxwell ) But some other fellers hold a grudge , I 'll tell you that . &nbsp; REPORTER 9 ( O.S. ) Jane Fonda said recently that the POWs lied when they said they had been tortured because they were obviously in good physical condition . . . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL CHARLES RANE ( interrupting ) That bitc . . .

Rane calms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what do you think of Ms. Fonda 's statement ? &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL CHARLES RANE ( hack-coughing ) People like that only made our mountain higher to climb .

He brought us Peace With Honor . I love this country and nobody could make me say different . &nbsp; REPORTER 11 ( O.S. ) Getting back to your treatment under the North Vietnamese . Is it true that before 1969 , when the conditions improved somewhat , you were beaten , given electric shocks , forced to crawl through latrines filled with excrement . . . ? &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL CHARLES RANE ( looks toward Maxwell ) I 'd rather not talk about it , you know . When we talk too much about it we either get angry or just cry . &nbsp; REPORTER 11 ( O.S. ) But surely you men , being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( interrupting ) You do n't understand . I never did anything heroic . I survived . All the heroes died . &nbsp; REPORTER 12 ( O.S. ) Is it true you and your wife have filed for divorce ? &nbsp; MAXWELLNo it is n't true and I think that question is entirely out of order . &nbsp; REPORTER 13 ( O.S. ) The businessmen of Corpus Christi , we have been told , have given you a brand new Cadillac . Plus you have received a color TV and many other gifts . In addition the government recently gave you a $124,000 check for back pay for hazardous duty . What are you going to do with all this money ?  --  10  --  &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL CHARLES RANE ( determined ) Well I ai n't gon na put it in no bank , that 's for sure .

Maxwell stands up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem too pleased with the outcome , but Rane is relieved . CAMERA follows Maxwell and Rane as they work through the crowd of reporters , photographers and onlookers toward the exit . Janet and Mark , surrounded by AF personnel , wait by the exit . As Maxwell and Rane elbow through the crowd , a statuesque TEXAS GIRL wearing yellow slacks and stacks of blond hair walks toward Charlie . She keeps her physical assets up front where everybody can see them . She brushes herself into Rane ; he looks back , somewhat startled . Thrusting her breasts into his medals , she wraps her arms around him and says : &nbsp; TEXAS GIRLOh , you men are so brave . Flashbulbs pop as photographers catch the scene . Rane smiles awkwardly and the Texas Girl disappears into the crowd . After she leaves , Rane realizes she has put a piece of paper into his hand . He glances at it . It reads : Linda Forchet TR4-3265 He slips the paper into his pocket and greets his wife and son at the doorway .

Mark and Rane lead the way as they walk up the sidewalk . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL CHARLES RANEChange your clothes and we 'll throw a football around , okay ? &nbsp; MARKSure . Rane and his son have little in common but blood . In seven years they have developed very different sensibilities . Mark wears his hair shoulder-length and dreams of being Mick Jagger ; Charlie assumes all young boys idolize baseball players and astronauts . They walk into INT . LIVING ROOM . Mark goes into his room to change and Rane wanders out into the back yard . The press conference is still unreeling in his mind . Maxwell and Janet stand in the living room and talk . Behind Janet , above the Scotchguard sofa , is Janet and Mark 's " Memory Wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pictures of Charles Rane taken before and during his capture .

All her instincts are kind and generous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simultaneously . &nbsp; JANETAs long as he needs me . A couple more weeks , a month if necessary .

There 's no need to rush . &nbsp; MAXWELLWe 'll have to have a long talk about this in a couple days . There 'll have to be some sort of statement to the press . Everybody 's interested in Charlie . ( excusing himself ) I 've got to run . I 'll just say goodbye to Charlie . Maxwell gives Janet a polite kiss and walks out back .  --  13  --  Maxwell walks across EXT .

He turns as he hears Maxwell walking toward him : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've got to keep moving , Rane .

I see the Doc regular . Maxwell nods . Mark , dressed in sneakers , jeans and a sweatshirt , walks toward them with a football . &nbsp; MAXWELL ( to Mark ) Gon na throw some football , Mark ? &nbsp; MARKIt ai n't even football season . &nbsp; MAXWELLYou do n't have to have seasons for everything . &nbsp; MARKI 'd rather be a surfer . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL CHARLES RANE ( stepping back ) Throw it here , Mark . &nbsp; MAXWELL ( excusing self ) See you later . Mark hurls the football awkwardly at his father . Mark is n't much of a Quarterback and the ball wobbles in Rane 's general direction  --  but then Charlie is n't much of an End either , and he stabs at the football @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maxwell exits , Rane , holding the football , stands and looks at his son , not quite knowing what to do next . CUT TO :  --  15  --  Section Details A GUEST FOR DINNER A GUEST FOR DINNER SUPPERTIME , that same day . Janet , Charlie , Mark and Cliff sit around the small kitchen table . Cliff , Janet 's future husband , is wearing his policeman 's uniform . He is about thirty and handsome in an average sort of way . His sharply starched blue uniform gives him a sexiness he would not normally have . They pass around bowls of mashed potatoes , peas and roast beef . For the moment each seems more interested in eating than talking . On the wall behind Rane is a grease-spattered map of Viet Nam with certain strategic locations circled with a red Magic Marker . Finally Charlie breaks the silence : &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL CHARLES RANEHow is that new team they have in Houston , the Astros ? &nbsp; CLIFF ( looking up ) I went to one of their games last year . &nbsp; MARKThey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . &nbsp; CLIFF ( to Mark ) At least they 're better than those Wahoos up in Dallas , the Texas Rangers . Washington D.C. 's rejects . Mark giggles : there is an obvious rapport between he and Cliff . &nbsp; JANETCorpus ai n't part of Texas anyway . Janet is referring to a private joke between Cliff and Mark , who respond with short chuckles . They do n't mean to cut Charlie out of their little jokes  --  they just do n't know how to get him in . &nbsp; CLIFFIf they try to give us some of their loser teams , we should succede from the state .  --  16  --  &nbsp; JANETNothing succeeds like succession . They all giggle again . There 's a guest for dinner all right , but it is n't Cliff  --  it 's Charlie . It 's as if he inadvertently walked in on somebody else 's family . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL CHARLES RANEThey did n't even have that Astro team when I was here before . &nbsp; CLIFFTexas was the better for it , too . Mark giggles again ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is another awkward silence . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL CHARLES RANE ( looking around ) I think I 'll have a drink . You want a drink , Cliff ? &nbsp; CLIFF ( eating ) No , not yet , Charlie . Charlie reaches over to a nearby cabinet and pulls out a quart of J&amp;B . Janet looks on disapprovingly as he pours himself several fingers . Taking a healthy swig , he feels the ripples of relaxation move through his body . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL CHARLES RANEI kinda like to see them Astros play , you know ?

Charles Rane sits in a large padded chair talking with Col. Maxwell . It is a psychiatrist-patient relationship , a relationship somewhat complicated by the fact , however , that they are both wearing their uniforms . Rane rambles on , speaking as if to no one but himself : &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL CHARLES RANEYou know , Bill , it took me three days just to figure out how to tie my damn shoes . I feel like such an ass . &nbsp; MAXWELLSeven years is a long time . I 'd be happy if I knew which shoe went where . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL CHARLES RANEAh , comeon , Bill .

Do you think that , Charlie ? &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL CHARLES RANE ( irritated ) Of course not . But their money do n't solve everything either . Sometimes I think they sent back an empty body and I was n't in it . Just another coffin . I 'm sick of being a hero . I 'm sick of being all locked in . &nbsp; MAXWELLMaybe it 's sex .

But last night I had a dream and I was screwing Tammy Wynette on a stairs . She was leaning back against the stairs , wearing this sort of fluffy yellow dress without underpants . I was wearing my uniform with my pants half-way down . Miss Tammy sort of had her dress hoisted above her waist .

I kept thinking , " Wow , this is got ta be Miss Tammy Wynette . " She did n't even sing . &nbsp; MAXWELLDo you like her singing ?  --  20  --  &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL CHARLES RANEOh , yeah .

Under his brown velvet suitcoat are the shredded remnants of a Cardin shirt , and , under that , a sleeveless undershirt . He notices a brown Ford station wagon ( the kind with fake wood on the side ) in the driveway as he walks past , but pays it no mind . Three of the license plate numbers are " RFD . " Rane opens the door and walks into the house . As Rane steps into the LIVING ROOM he feels the presence of someone behind him . The steel blue barrel of a .38 revolver is raised to the back of his head . A raspy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hero . Sit down . Rane walks slowly across the room and sits on the sofa underneath the Memory Wall . To his right is the new color TV ; some of the presents atop it have been opened . Among the presents we notice some cologne and  --  of all things  --  Barry Sadler 's 1969 " Green Berets " album . Rane surveys the room : A fortyish MEXICAN in a Robert Hall suit stands before him with a .38 in his hand . Two young Texas thugs stand against the far wall . They wear cowboy boots , faded jeans , western shirts , Stetsons and shit-eating grins . They also carry revolvers . The door to Mark 's bedroom is ajar . Janet and Mark , frightened , sit on the edge of the bed watching someone out of Rane 's view . &nbsp; MEXICANWe hear you got some money hid , hero . We 'd like to have it . Rane says nothing . &nbsp; MEXICANYou might as well talk up now , hero , cause you 're going to talk sooner or later and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to later .  --  28  --  Rane opens his mouth : words come out . He speaks in an empty monotone : &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL CHARLES RANEThat money is all I got to show for seven years . I will never give it up . &nbsp; MEXICANYou will give it up , gringo . You know that . CAMERA CLOSES IN on Rane : he says nothing . The Mexican motions to the two thugs . He speaks in a tired professional tone of voice : &nbsp; MEXICANAll right , T-Bird , bust heem . Pegale . T-BIRD , the first Texan , walks over to Rane and clips him across the chin with the barrel of his gun . Blood appears on Charlie 's lower cheek . T-Bird aims his revolver point blank at Rane 's left eye . The SECOND TEXAN , a hulking young man , walks around the other side of Rane and puts a knife to his throat . A drop of blood trickles down his neck . &nbsp; MEXICANTe duele , hero ? ( pauses ) Look , I do n't want to fool around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you do n't tell us where that 124 Gs is hid , you are going to be dead very soon . Janet 's SOBS can be heard from the bedroom . CAMREA CLOSES IN on Rane again , and all of a sudden we realize how he survived seven years of torture : It is as if Charles Rane has removed his mind from his body . It does n't matter what anybody does to his body because he is no longer in it . These men are torturing an empty body . Rane 's awkwardness and uneasiness are suddenly gone . His face is blank , calm , distant ; he is now in a world he totally understands . He is more experienced at being tortured than his torturers are at torturing.  --  29  --  He really does n't have the choice whether to tell them where the money is hidden or not . He could not tell if he wanted to . He has lost his capacity to give in . As the Mexican 's boots step toward Rane , we notice they are made from multi-colored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulls a gold butane lighter from his pocket . Igniting it , the Mexican runs the lighter up and down Charlie 's cheek . Even though he is not tied or held down , Rane does not resist . &nbsp; MEXICANCome on , hero , comeon . Where de mangos hid , hey ? The Mexican pulls his lighter away from Rane 's blistered cheek . &nbsp; T-BIRDMan , that usually does it . &nbsp; SECOND TEXANSheeit , that old boy is a tough un . ( chortles ) The Second Texan is obviously a low grade intelligence . The Mexican looks at him a moment . Thinking , the Mexican pulls out a cigarette and lights it with his lighter . Suddenly  --  angry and exasperated  --  the Mexican chucks down his cigarette and lighter and grabs Rane by his brown velvet lapels . &nbsp; MEXICANCabron ! I can make this damn Texican talk . The Mexican hauls Charlie into the KITCHEN and the Texans follow . Passing in front of the grease-spattered map of Viet Nam , the Mexican grabs Charlie by the left wrist and leads him over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then flips the switch : we hear the familiar grinding sound . Holding Charlie 's hand above the disposal , the Mexican yells : &nbsp; MEXICANTalk now , hero ! Rane says nothing .  --  30  --  The Mexican thrusts Charlie 's hand into the disposal . We hear a hideous grinding sound . Rane 's face is blitzed with pain . &nbsp; MEXICANCabron , gringo . Me cago en la leche de tu puta madre . Maricon . Concha . Bizocho . The Mexican pulls Rane 's hand out of the disposal and examines it ( we do not see the hand ) . &nbsp; T-BIRD ( with admiration ) Es un tio barbaro . &nbsp; MEXICAN ( to Rane ) Talk ! Rane says nothing . The Mexican rethrusts Charlie 's hand into the disposal . This time the Mexican does not remove it so quickly . We here the GRINDING of flesh and bones as we watch Rane 's agonized , stoic face . His body cries out for him to break down but he can not . When the Mexican finally does remove Rane 's hand and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fleetingly ) that the fingers have been ground away . The Mexican walks back toward the living room . T-Bird follows . The Second Texan grabs a kitchen towel and wraps up the bloody mess under Rane 's left cuff . &nbsp; T-BIRDI do n't think we 're going to get it , jefe . &nbsp; MEXICANMaybe not . But we got one more chance . As they enter the LIVING ROOM the Mexican calls into Mark 's bedroom : &nbsp; MEXICANMelio . Traigame son esposo . The Second Texan brings Charlie back into the living room and sets him down on the sofa . Rane looks up at the Mexican .  --  31  --  MELIO , a young Mexican hood wearing tight green pants , brings Janet in from the bedroom . Janet tries to scream when she sees Charlie but the only thing that comes from her mouth is a pathetic croaking sound . The Mexican gestures and Melio forces Janet to her knees in front of Charlie . Melio puts his small .32 automatic to her temples . &nbsp; MEXICANMano , in another time and place I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . so macho . But now I am going to have to kill your wife if you do not tell me where that money is hid right away . You know I am telling the truth . Your wife is very close to death . CAMERA CLOSES IN on Rane 's face : there is no emotion . CAMERA stays on Rane 's face as we hear three voice tracks simultaneously . One voice is Janet 's , another the Mexican 's , and the third  --  and dominant  --  is Charlie 's own narrative VOICE OVER . It is an excerpt from something he has told Maxwell : a reminiscence from Hanoi . &nbsp; JANET O.S. Tell them , Charlie ! Oh please , please , please tell them ! It 's not worth it . Oh , Charlie , tell them . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL CHARLES RANE V.O. They would walk into my cell , two of them , the one we called Oil Can Harry and Ap Chong , his assistant .

Ten seconds . Talk . Five seconds . Talk , hero . All these voices abrupt HALT when we hear the sharp sound of a .32 automatic discharging . BAAM ! There is an ABBREVIATED SCREAM , a SILENCE , and the THUD of a body slumping to the floor . Rane 's face is as calm and placid as the distant sea . We hear Mark 's SCREAMING VOICE and CAMERA CUTS to him running from the bedroom :  --  32  --  &nbsp; MARKI know where the money 's hid . I know where . It 's in the barn . Out back . Under the tools . I saw him hide it . Even this draws no emotion from Rane . &nbsp; MEXICAN ( softly ) Menos mal . Show him where , kid . Go on . The Second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his assistants look at the money briefly as the Second Texan opens the sack on the chair . Rane sits unmoving , Janet 's body at his feet .

Still the same plan . &nbsp; MEXICANYou and T-Bird take the wagon and we 'll meet at Big Ed 's in Acuna . The Mexican stoops beside Janet 's body to pick up his gold butane lighter . Melio packs up the money and starts out the front door . T-Bird gestures toward Mark and Rane : &nbsp; T-BIRDWhat about them ? &nbsp; MEXICANWe 'll have to stop them , of course . There 's no stopping now . ( looks at Rane ) Yeah . Kill the poor son of a bitch .  --  33  --  T-Bird raises his revolver arm 's length and shoots Mark in the head .

In the BEDROOM , he removes a stack of twenty dollar bills which had been hidden under the dresser . There appears to be about $500 . When he slips the wad of bills into his pants pocket , Charlie feels something unusual there . Fishing around in his pocket , he comes out with a piece of paper .

Rane , who had been lying back against the front seat staring at the heavens , turns and looks at Linda cuddled up beside him . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL CHARLES RANEYes ? &nbsp; LINDAWhatcha doing ?  --  79  --  &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL CHARLES RANEThinking . &nbsp; LINDAOh .

CAR : Linda , her pullover spread across her breasts , feels a JOLT and wakes up . She looks out the back window and sees Charlie jacking up the car . The trunk door is closed . Dressing quickly , Linda gets out and walks around back . &nbsp; LINDA'Morning , ugly . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL CHARLES RANE ( smiles ) Same to you , beautiful . She embraces his shoulders . They exchange a short kiss . TIMECUT : Rane pounds the hubcap on the new tire . He opens the trunk and hefts the old tire and jack into it with his good hand . Linda stares in shock as she sees the row upon row of guns carefully placed in the trunk . Rane says nothing . TIMECUT : The Cadillac ( top down ) speeds down U.S. 90 . TIMECUT : Rane pulls into an ECONO-GAS station . Linda gets out and heads toward the Ladies Room . Charlie says something to the station attendant . Next to the Econo-Gas station stands FRED DOBB 'S @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with hand-painted signs and pictures . The pictures , painted against a red backdrop like a carnival sideshow , depict various animal mutants : a two-headed calf , Siamese twin sheep , a one-eyed horse and a five-legged dog . Homemade sideshows of this sort are not unusual in this part of Texas . Charlie meets Linda as she emerges from the Ladies Room . Throughout the last day , Linda 's immaculately conceived plastic snuff look has slowly been unraveling.  --  81  --  Her hair hangs about her neck , her pullover and skirt are hopelessly wrinkled , her makeup is faint and uneven . She grows more beautiful by the hour . Linda 's demeanor indicates she wants to have a " talk " with Rane . They stand before Fred Dobb 's colorful panoply of mutants : &nbsp; LINDAAh , Charlie , I 've been thinking . About this trip and all . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL CHARLES RANEYeah ? &nbsp; LINDADo n't you think it 's going a little too far , huh ? Should n't we be going back to Corpus ? They 're bound to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppose they are . &nbsp; LINDAWo n't the doctors want to see you ? &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL CHARLES RANEI suppose they would . &nbsp; LINDAI want to go back . I should get back . Let 's go . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL CHARLES RANEOkay . &nbsp; LINDA ( takes his arm ) Great . They start walking toward the car . Reaching in his pocket , Rane pulls out the wad of twenties . Pulling off several hundred dollars , he gives them to her . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL CHARLES RANEYou can take a cab back with this . &nbsp; LINDANo , we were going to go back together . Rane nods his head silently " No " and holds out the money for her .  --  82  --  &nbsp; LINDAIt is n't right . I should n't take your money . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL CHARLES RANETake it , Linda . I wo n't need it where I 'm going . &nbsp; LINDAWo n't you come back with me ? &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL CHARLES RANEIt 's too late . I 'm only pointed in one direction now . I have no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward the Cadillac . Rane hands Linda her overnight bag from the back seat and pays the station attendant . They exchange a long kiss . The station boy looks on . &nbsp; LINDAI ai n't sorry I done this , you know . Charlie looks pained . He says nothing . &nbsp; LINDAIt was real though , huh ? &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL CHARLES RANEWas n't it ? Rane climbs into the front seat and starts the engine . They glance at each other a moment , each hoping the other will relent . Neither does . Rane slips the car into gear and pulls out of the station . Linda calls after him : &nbsp; LINDACharlie ! Charlie ! Wait for me ! Charlie slams the Cadillac to a stop and backs to where Linda is standing . The station attendant stares in amazement . Rane , relieved , smiles as Linda gets in . He notices the station attendant watching : &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL CHARLES RANEHey , station boy ! Come here .  --  83  --  The station boy walks over . Rane digs a medal out of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LIEUTENANT COLONEL CHARLES RANEHere . This is for you . The station boy examines the medal . &nbsp; STATION ATTENDANTWow . A Purple Heart . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL CHARLES RANE ( expansive ) It 's a present from my lady friend here . &nbsp; STATION ATTENDANT ( to Linda ) Thank you , ma'am . Linda smiles , and as she does . . . Rane tromps on the accelerator and the huge red Cadillac lurches forward in a burst of exhaust and spitting gravel . A quarter mile down the highway one could still hear the squealing tires . CUT TO : pp. 42-61 &nbsp; pp. 84-103 FOREPLAY TO GUNPLAY FOREPLAY TO GUNPLAY It is about 11:00 a.m. when Charlie and Linda drive their Cadillac ( top down ) through the streets of El Paso . They both look worn and exhausted . Charlie 's uniform is soiled and wrinkled ; there are still bloodstains on his left leg . Linda is disheveled . They drive slowly through the bustling streets , looking about as if oddly surprised to find civilization still exists . Rane spots a clean middle-class motel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having checked in , trudge to their room . Linda does n't bother to bring her overnight bag . INSIDE the MOTEL ROOM , Rane walks directly to the bathroom and begins freshening up . He strips to the waist . Dampening a washcloth , he begins to wash his upper torso . Lying on the king-size bed , Linda watches Charlie silently . Looking into the mirror , Rane runs his hand over his day-old beard . He turns back toward Linda : &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL CHARLES RANEDid you bring your razor , Linda ? I forgot mine . She does not answer . Charlie walks into the bedroom . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL CHARLES RANEDid you ? Bring a razor ? Linda speaks softly but forcefully : &nbsp; LINDAWhere are you going , Charlie ? &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL CHARLES RANEEl Paso . Peacock . &nbsp; LINDANo , you 're not . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL CHARLES RANEI 'm not ?  --  85  --  &nbsp; LINDANo . Not yet at least . You 're coming to bed with me . You 're sleepy and need rest . You 're still sick . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Linda says nothing . Charlie looks wistfully at his waiting Cadillac . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL CHARLES RANEYou got the razor , though ? &nbsp; LINDAYeah . I got the razor . Charlie sits on the bed and Linda runs her hand across his tight stomach and chest . &nbsp; LINDAYou know you do n't have to go at all if you do n't want to . He begins undressing her . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL CHARLES RANEHow am I going to get any sleep if you do n't open the bed ? Linda pulls off her top and opens the bed . &nbsp; LINDAYou always sleep with your shoes on ? Charlie flops his feet on the bed . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL CHARLES RANEOnly when I 'm too tired to take them off . Charlie and Linda look at each other a moment . They embrace . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL CHARLES RANEOh , darling . &nbsp; LINDAI love you , too , Charlie .  --  86  --  TIMECUT : two hours later . Linda , naked , sits up in bed . Charlie , dressed and shaved , sits at the small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ map of El Paso and three guns  --  the two nickel-plated .45s and the Browning Double Barrel . Rane inspects , hefts and tests the guns . He loads them . Hearing Linda rustle in the bed , he turns around and smiles at her . &nbsp; LINDA ( pause ) I was serious about what I said , Charlie . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL CHARLES RANEWhat was that ? &nbsp; LINDAAbout not having to go . You do n't have to , you know . Rane says nothing . He gathers up his map and guns . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL CHARLES RANEI know . Rane starts toward the door : &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL CHARLES RANEIf I 'm not back by morning , get out of town . Catch a plane , ride the hound , do what you need . There 's money in the drawer there . ( gestures ) Linda looks at him a second then says playfully : &nbsp; LINDA " Roses are red , Violets are blue , A pie 's got a crust , And so do you .

CUT TO :  --  87  --  STAKEOUT Watching the street signs , Rane pulls up to the corner of Peacock and Arroyo and turns slowly down Peacock . It is an old wealthy section of town . Driving slowly down the street , Rane examines the houses on both sides of the street . In the rear of a large brick house , Rane spots the brown wood-paneled Ford station wagon . The letters " RFD " appear on the license plate . Rane parks his car at a safe distance and waits . After a while , someone walks out onto the front porch and walks back in . T-Bird . Rane waits some more . He fishes around in the glove compartment , comes out with a brown-bagged pint of J&amp;B . He pulls the paper back , unscrews the cap and takes a hit . Then down the street comes a long white Lincoln Continental . A large pair of steer horns is mounted on the hood . A young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Texan dressed in a flashy lime green cowboy outfit , and , next to him , sits the Mexican in a new black suit with a red tie . Rane slouches in the front seat and watches them pass . The Continental pulls up in front of the Wayne House and HONKS its horn . After a moment , several men come walking out of the front door and step down the steps . We recognize : T-Bird , the Second Texan and Melio , now wearing tight orange pants . They all squeeze into the Continental . We overhear a few snatches of conversation : &nbsp; T-BIRDHot damndeddy . We gon na have a time ! Estupendo ! &nbsp; SECOND TEXANChiquita banana , here I come ! ( chortles ) The Mexican lights up a cigarette with his butane lighter .  --  88  --  There is laughter as the Continental pulls away from the curb . Rane turns his car around and follows them at a distance . Rane follows the Continental south through El Paso until it reaches the Stanton Street Bridge . Rane waits as the Continental passes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The BORDER GUARD waves him over . &nbsp; BORDER GUARDWhere you going , soldier ? &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL CHARLES RANEJuarez . &nbsp; BORDER GUARDHow long will you be there ? Rane tries to keep one eye on the vanishing Continental : &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL CHARLES RANEA couple hours . &nbsp; BORDER GUARD ( handing him card ) This is a 24-hour entry permit . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL CHARLES RANEThanks . Rane starts to pull away . The Guard calls after him : &nbsp; BORDER GUARDHey , wait ! Rane stops the car . The Border Guard walks up . He looks at Charlie 's artificial hand . &nbsp; BORDER GUARDAre n't you Charles Rane , that POW ? The Continental is completely gone from sight , lost in the maze of Mexican streets . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL CHARLES RANE ( wary ) Yeah ? &nbsp; BORDER GUARDYou 're real famous . I 've been reading all about you in the paper .  --  89  --  Rane shrugs . &nbsp; BORDER GUARDHey , do you mind if I have my picture taken with you ? My wife talks about you all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Continental . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL CHARLES RANE ( resigned ) Sure . The Border Guard goes back into the Customs Office and re-emerges with a SECRETARY and a Brownie Starflex . The Border Guard poses beside the car as the Secretary snaps the picture . Just before the camera clicks , Charlie lets out with his big beaming officious smile . &nbsp; BORDER GUARDHey , thanks a lot . Rane reaches into his back pocket and pulls out another medal . He gives it to the Border Guard . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL CHARLES RANEHere , this is a present . The Border Guard seems puzzled as he looks at the medal . Rane SQUEALS off . Rane now wanders through the side streets of Juarez . He has lost the trail . The Continental is not to be found anywhere . TIMECUT : an hour later . Rane , driving down a side street in the red light district , sees the white Continental with the steer-horn hood ornament . He slows down and parks . One large stucco house seems to be the focus of all the activity on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watches for a moment . Melio walks out on the front porch with a drink in his hand . After a moment , a Mexican girl joins him and they sit on the old porch sofa together . They cuddle and share drinks from his glass like a couple of high school sweethearts . Very touching .  --  90  --  Rane looks down at the seat beside him . There , lying against the red leather , is a nickel-plated .45 automatic . TIMECUT : Rane is still sitting in the front seat . Melio and the Mexican girl have gone in the house . Rane looks down at the .45 then up at the brothel . He thinks a moment , tucks the gun under the front seat , starts up the engine and drives away . CUT TO :  --  91  --  Section Details DREAMS OF BUNNIES DREAMS OF BUNNIES About 5:30 p.m .

Johnny Vohden , about 26 , lean , handsome ( we saw him in the credits ) , sits sandwiched on the sofa between his wife and sister .

We have ample opportunity to study the layout of the brothel . When he reaches the top of the stairs , Johnny hears the LOUD VOICES of several men . We recognize one of the voices : T-Bird . Candy walks one way down the carpeted corridor , while Johnny intentionally walks the other way . Candy calls him back : &nbsp; CANDYHey , gringo ! Johnny peeks into one room and sees a pair of multicolored suede patches boots on the floor . Love-making sounds come from within the room . &nbsp; VOHDEN ( to Candy ) No rooms here ? &nbsp; CANDYThis way . ( gestures ) Johnny listens in on the next room he passes .

A young MEXICAN-AMERICAN stands guard by a rear stairway . Setting his shotgun down , Rane walks over to the Mexican . Before the Mexican can reach for his small revolver , Charlie claps his hand . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL CHARLES RANEListen , amigo , why do n't you just scram ? All hell 's gon na break out inside there and you ai n't gon na wan na be around . The Mexican-American seems confused . &nbsp; MEXICAN-AMERICANI guard here . No one comes in . Rane puts his hand on the Mexican-American 's face as if he were giving him a benediction . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL CHARLES RANEI 'm not fooling , son . If you do n't leave you 'll be dead . Rane pushes his face away .  --  108  --  The young Mexican-American does not take his advice ; instead he reaches for his revolver . Rane wrenches the Mexican-American 's arm behind his back , spins him around and , reaching around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Mexican-American gurgles a moment , then falls over . Charlie walks back to pick up his shotgun . CUT TO : CANDY 'S ROOM . Johnny sits on the edge of the bed , his ears cocked : waiting , listening . Strains of " La Golondrina " can be heard in the background . &nbsp; CANDYYou just sit there ? &nbsp; VOHDENI ai n't got much energy left , baby . You 're going to have to help me . With a sigh of resignation , Candy walks over to the bed and begins unbuttoning Johnny 's AF shirt . Johnny 's ears are perked , listening for even the slightest sound . CUT TO : EXT . STAIRWAY . Carrying the Browning shotgun , Rane stealthily walks up the rear stairs . The two nickel-plated .45s in his waistband glimmer in the moonlight . Reaching the top of the stairs , Charlie peeks into the corridor . It is empty . He enters . Rane tiptoes down the carpeted corridor , listening and looking as he goes . CUT TO : CANDY 'S ROOM . Candy , having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pulls them off . The socks follow . Listening closely , Johnny hears Charlie 's footsteps coming down the hall . He is all ears now . As Candy reaches for Johnny 's belt buckle his hand drops down toward his duffle bag , revealing the guns . Rane 's FOOTSTEPS tiptoe down the hall . Candy loosens Johnny 's belt . She puts her hand in his waistband.  --  109  --  CU : Johnny 's hand slips into the duffle bag and clasps the handle of the .45 . CUT TO : CORRIDOR . Charlie looks through an ajar door : he sees the patched suede boots sitting on the floor . Hoisting the huge Browning B-SS waist level , he poises himself and slowly kicks the door open . The door slowly opens : inside , the Mexican lies rutting with a whore . Rane waits for the Mexican to notice him . The Mexican 's eyes look up and recognize Charlie . Rane says softly : &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL CHARLES RANEStand up , amigo . Die on your feet . The Mexican slowly gets up . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . &nbsp; MEXICANAh , Texican , you are such a macho . Rane discharges both barrels of the Browning , blowing both the Mexican and his whore into the wallpaper . CUT : CANDY 'S ROOM . Johnny hears the blast , grabs his .45 out of the duffle bag and smashes Candy across the face with it . She reels against the far wall . &nbsp; VOHDENBitch ! Johnny reaches into the duffle bag with his other hand and pulls out the sawed-off pump shotgun . Candy SCREAMS . Carrying a gun in each hand , Johnny bursts out of Candy 's room and jumps into the CORRIDOR . He arrives in time to see Charlie chucking down the Browning B-SS and pulling one of the nickel-plated .45s from his waistband . Their eyes meet . The brothel is filled with the sounds of SCREAMING and PANIC . No more " La Golondrina. "  --  110  --  &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL CHARLES RANEJohnny ! &nbsp; VOHDENCharlie ! Johnny tucks his .45 into his waist and they each move toward a door . A door opens : a drunken T-Bird is looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scrambles for a gun . The Second Texan holds a long knife . &nbsp; T-BIRDHot damn . &nbsp; SECOND TEXANSheeit . Three successive blasts from Johnny 's 12 gauge pump shotgun send the poker players flying in every direction . We notice a bit of T-Bird here , a bit of Melio ( in orange pants ) there . The bodies of a couple women join the melee . The Second Texan , SCREAMING , covered with blood and holding his knife , charges toward Johnny . Another blast from the Winchester sends him spinning backwards . Rane pushes open his door and finds there an innocent American businessman cowering under the bed and a frightened whore cowering atop it . Rane is too keyed up to stop now : he plugs them both with the .45 , first the American , then the whore . Rane steps back into the corridor next to Johnny . There is the SOUND of running feet from the end of the corridor . Charlie turns and fires . Candy 's bloody body rolls down the carpet . There is a sharp RETORT from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spreads from a bullet wound in his side . Johnny wheels around and sees Big Ed standing behind Charlie with a smoking .38 in his hand . Big Ed is wearing his unbuttoned lime green Western shirt with the rhinestone wagon wheels on it . Two blasts from Johnny 's shotgun send Big Ed bouncing on his butt down the hall . Johnny throws down the shotgun and pulls his .45.  --  111  --  One door remains unopened on the second floor . Johnny and Charlie approach it with their .45s drawn at arm 's length . Two young half-naked Mexicans , one of them Big Ed 's chauffeur , burst out of the room firing their revolvers . They are cut down in the crossfire of .45 slugs . Johnny catches a surface wound in his right forearm . Johnny ducks down , crossing in front of the opening at the top of the stairs . A bullet flies past his head as he runs . He notices several Mexican thugs standing at the foot of the stairs out of the corner of his eyes . They have drawn guns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest a moment , looking at each other across the bannister opening . It is possible for them to retreat out the back stairs , but they do not . Charlie drops his .45 and pulls a freshly loaded one from his waist . His shirt is soaked with blood . Johnny discharges the spent clip from his .45 and inserts a fresh one from his pocket . They look at each other a moment , deciding what to do . Charlie yells to Johnny in Vietnamese : &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL CHARLES RANEChung ta di di ! Johnny replies : &nbsp; VOHDENDeath ! Da Nang ! Hanoi ! They jump into the bannister opening and rapidly discharge their automatics down the stairs . A Mexican falls at the foot of the stairs . Charlie catches another bullet in the chest and falls down the stairs . Johnny calls to him as he falls : &nbsp; VOHDENCharlie ! Charlie !  --  112  --  Johnny is hit in the upper shoulder with a .38 . He is stopped but for a second , then comes back firing . Another Mexican falls . Only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Charlie yanks the 357 out of his back , pulls himself up on the bannister and blasts the remaining Mex across the blood-spattered room . Simultaneously , Charlie catches a slug in his throat . Trying to speak , he gurgles blood and dies . Though Charlie 's killer is already dead , Johnny plugs him again . And again . There are no more men at the foot of the stairs . Only bloody bodies , scared whores and a discarded guitar . The CAMERA SLOWLY PANS up the stairs from Charlie 's dead body to Johnny still standing at the top of the stairs . He stands bareback in bare feet , his belt hanging loose . Blood covers his right breast and left forearm . Contorted bodies lie on the floor behind him . There is a .45 in his hand . He is SCREAMING at the top of his lungs . His gun is empty but Johnny can not stop firing it . His finger manickly pulls the trigger : CLICK , CLICK , CLICK , CLICK , CLICK , CLICK . The image FREEZE FRAME @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his mouth frozen open in a never-ending scream . Keyed-up , ready to go . A force in motion , unable to stop . Pure energy . The FREEZE FRAME HOLDS as we hear only the SOUND of ROLLING THUNDER . THE END pp. 84-103 &nbsp;
