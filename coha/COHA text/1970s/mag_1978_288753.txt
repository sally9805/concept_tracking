Berner eyes Kennecott cash <P> Takeover artists are often suspected of wanting to tap the till of the target company , but hardly any ever admit it-let alone boast about it . An exception is T. Roland Berner , chairman of Curtiss-Wright , who is campaigning to unseat directors of Kennecott Copper and install his own board in a shareholder election May 2 . In the most unusual proxy statement in recent years , Berner last week vowed that if Curtiss-Wright gets control , it will distribute some $660 million of Kennecott 's assets to stockholders-who prominently include Curtiss-Wright . It owns 3.3 million Kennecott shares , or nearly 10% of the total . <P> Curtiss-Wright told Kennecott 's shareholders that it would raise most of the money by having Kennecott sell Carborundum , for $567 million or a bit less . Berner would make up the rest by dipping into Kennecott 's $140 million in cash and securities , and perhaps by having Kennecott borrow against a $400 million promissory note . <P> Money in hand , Curtiss-Wright might have Kennecott make a cash distribution of some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case , Curtiss-Wright would get back $66 million on Kennecott stock that it paid around $77 million to buy . Berner 's preferred alternative is to have Kennecott buy back half its 33.1 million outstanding shares for about $40 each-including half the stock that Curtiss-Wright bought for an average $23.42 a share . Other Kennecott stockholders might find Berner 's plans attractive . Kennecott management is sure to find them a tempting target for that old pejorative : raid .
