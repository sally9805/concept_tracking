txt The Douse Judiciary Commit tee today formally began its most extraordinary task ? considering the , impeachment of the President of the United States . Against a background of murmuring v o I c es and the clicking of camera shutters , Committee Chairman Peter Bodies D. , N. J.I and ranking Republican Edward Hutchinson Mich. each read an opening statement . " We understand our high constitutional responsibility , " Rodino said . " We will faithfully live up to it . " THEN , AFTER some parliamentary wrangling , the committee went into executive session . The cameras which had carried the brief proceedings over live television were shut off , and the reporters were forced to leave . Behind closed doors , the committee mem b ers were scheduled to begin hearing a summary of their staff 's information about President Nixon 's role , if any , in the Watergate break-in and ? coverup . WHEN THE closed meeting ended about three hours later , Rodino said the day 's summary concerned events leading up to the June 17 , 1972 , Watergate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the White House staff , the President 's 1972 campaign organization , and G. Gordon Liddy 's political espionage plans . Liddy was convicted in the Watergate burglary . Rodino refused to discuss details of the evidence , but others indicated that there had been no major revelations . Rep. Delbert Latta R. , Ohio described the information as " everything you 've already read in the paper . " The committee members were permitted to take home today 's evidence and the voluminous index of all the Watergate evidence . Under the committee 's rules , they are not permitted to discuss the evidence wills anyone . These executive hearings will continue next week , Rodino said , when the 38 committee members will hear portions of the 19 taped White House conversations the committee has . EXCEPT FOR Rodino and Hutchinson , no member of the committee has heard these tapes . They have been in the hands of the inquiry staff under strict rules of confidentiality . In their opening statements , both Rodino and Hutchinson underscored the historic importance of what they were doing , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which has not been directed against a President since 1861 " I do n't need , " Rodino said , " to stress again the importance of our undertaking and the wisdom , decency , and principle which we must bring to it . " HUTCHINSON NOTED that impeachment was " the most awesome power constitutionally vested in the House of Representatives . " Despite these lofty phrases , the opening hearing lacked the air of history In the making . Both Rodino and Hutchinson delivered thek talks in conversational tones , in a room painted the light-green color often found in county courthouses . Even tho it has a huge , gold eagle carved onto the back wall , room 2141 of the Rayburn House Office Building does not seem a likely setting for a crisis of the U. S. Constitution . FLUORESCENT lights covered by plastic mesh illuminate the room from the high ceiling . and a green rug with stars and symbols covers the floor . The room appears much like a corporate hoard room . Hints of both the interparty and intraparty problems which may plague Rodino @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rodino said the committee is operating under the rules of the House and " technical rules of evidence do not apply . But Hutchinson took a stricter view . The Republican leader aunted from a 1776 English law dic:lottery which said " the same evidence is required in an impeachment ... as in the ordinary courts of justice . " And he said the House should not vote to impeach with " a finding of criminal culpability on the part of the President himself , measured according to criminal law . " A FEW MINUTES later . some of the more avowedly anti-Nixon Democrats on the committee opposed the Rodinohacked motion to close the hearing to the press . They were led by Rep. John Conyers of Michigan , win : dietribtied a statement calling for ' the searchlight of full covertge on our activities . Citing parliamentary rules , Rodino would not allow Conyers to read his statement at : he hearing . Five other Demor at es voted with Conyers against closing the meeting . After the first four closed hearings , scheduled to end next week , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ c t public hearings where witnesses will be questioned . WITHIN LIMITS , President Nixon 's counsel , James St. Clair , . will be allowed to crossexamine these witnesses and to raise objections . St. Clair was at today 's hearing , accom- , panied by aides John A. McCahill and Mac Howard . Ile said he was there to listen and not to speak , unless asked . Rodino said that the White House lawyers will be bound by the same rules of confidentiality as the staff and committee members . After the committee finishes examining the Watergate breakin and coverup , it will move on to the other allegations made against Nixon . AMONG THESE are : ? That the President raised milk price support levels in return for campaign fund contributions by the dairy industry . ? That he interfered with government prosecution of an antitrust case against I. T. T. in return for a large campaign gift from that corporate conglomerate . ? That he took fradulent income tax deductions on his 1969 return . Some of the deductions taken by Nixon have already been disallowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of f r a u d . Nixon has made a total back payment of $467,000 f o r improper deductions for 1968 thru 1971 . ? THE COMMITTEE , 21 Democrats and 17 Republicans , has been planning for these hearings since last December , shortly after impeachment resolutions were introduced in the House . In February , the House , by a vote of 410 to 4 , passed a resolution giving the committee full power to make the Investigation . Since then , the committee has been seeking evidence and working out its rules of procedure , and the staff has been conducting an extensive investigation of the charges . The evidence which the staff will transmit to the committee includes the satchel-full of tapes and documents given the committee by the Watergate special prosecutor 's office , on orders of Federal Judge John Shies . The committee also has the report on Nixon 's tax re urns written by the staff of the Joint Congressional Committee on Internal Revenue Taxation and documents from court cases In which scandal-related figures have been tried or sued .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
