A story by C. W. Gusewelle THE WAY TO PRAGUE T HE MACHINE STOPPED , simply stopped without notice . Waclaw turned the engine , but there was nothing . Then he remembered to show the lights , quickly , and behind us in the dark there was the huge grinding of two miles of medium tanks stopping on the road . The bearded colonel came back from his car ahead . Poor Waclaw was beating on the wheel in a fit of helplessness . " What is it ? " the colonel asked him . " My truck is stopped . " " Man . I see that . For what ? " " For nothing that I can tell . The gas is good . There is electricity . " " Take it off the road . " " Maybe it is something with the fuel line . " Greatly excited , Waclaw was turning the engine again . " It must be either ? " And the colonel , with irritation : " For one truck you would stop a division ? " " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the side , then . But take care for the ditch . " ( To me now , leaning across . ) " And when it is fixed come to us . Good ? The road is well marked . " The bearded colonel , hatless , went forward again to his car . Gabriel and the others climbed out through the rear canvas and together we pushed it off onto the dirt . The light ahead blinked and the line started up again . Waclaw lifted the truck 's bonnet and stood beside it , watching the tanks go by . As if hoping someone might yet notice and pity and stop for him , after all . The force and bulk of their passage made the speed appear greater , but really it was quite slow . We heard the sound for a long time . And then only crickets in the night . M ORNING FOUND US at the head of a long , golden valley . Along it the road ran out to a fine line and curved from sight .

He had struck his head and there was new grease , opaque orange , in his pointed cap of hair . His truck was a slattern , a perversity . " We might leave it and walk , " Gabriel suggested . " It 's such a nice place here for walking . " Waclaw 's shoulders bunched up against what passed for his neck . " If it is not the gas . " He pinched the fingers of one hand in turn , starting with the thumb . " And if it is not the battery . And if there is spark . And if ? " " Who else cares to walk ? " Gabriel said . " You , Zenon ? Rozek ? " Waclaw , a stone , ignored them . He was repeating on his fingers . " Pity . Then I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of taking his kit and his weapon from the back of the truck . " I am a man of war , " he said . " And I have an appointment with my duty . " We had to laugh . It was his way . Gabriel I knew a long time from school . He was a tailor 's son and not made for the army . Not at all . " These others are nothing , " he told Waclaw . " It 's you , light spirit , I hate to leave . Come with me , wo n't you ?

" You there , " Waclaw called , but the woman went inside a doorway . He looked after her . " Rude damned people , " he said . " Or timid , " Gabriel told him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ display of force . " Even Waclaw laughed at that : six men and a broken truck . We found a boy , a simpleton , who fetched a man , and the man  --  sullenly , I thought  --  brought us finally to a mechanic . The garage was in the rear , a vaulted , stone-floored room poorly lighted from the open door . " He says he will look at it , " Gabriel told Waclaw . " But it will be tomorrow or maybe the next day . Today , he says , he is occupied . " I objected , but the mechanic stared back vacantly . Whether ignorant or only stubborn , he would have himself spoken to in no language but his own . He had come from his breakfast , eyes crusted and a napkin forgotten in his belt . Plainly , though , the garage was empty of other machines . So I said to Gabriel , " Tell him tomorrow is not soon enough . Tonight we must be in the capital . " " It 's his duty , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was some discussion . The mechanic shrugged . " He says that if we order him to  --  if he has no choice  --  he might look at it . " So the truck was brought and the man took down a soiled canvas smock which he put on over his breakfast napkin . And the others went for food . " Some bread will do , " Gabriel said . " And something to drink , for afternoon , " Waclaw told them . " Bring some wine or beer . They 'll give it to us , I think . " Boleslaw went , with Zenon and Jerzy Rozek . If there were food Boleslaw would find it , with or without words . Gabriel we needed to deal about the truck . " Ask him how the liberation progresses , " I said . The man had turned the starter and now grunted something as he climbed down and opened the bonnet . " He has no radio . " " He has heard , though ? " The mechanic put his face into the machine . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of white bristles . His answer was to the engine . " He says he will look at the truck but will not discuss politics . " The fault was with the carburetor . A broken part . No , the piece could not be repaired . No , it was unlike any he kept . " He 'll have to make one , then , " Waclaw said . Gabriel repeated , and the man smiled coolly at Waclaw with broken teeth . " Or take one from another machine . Not the piece , the whole assembly . " Explanation . Discussion . Another shrug . " He says he can look , " Gabriel said . " From a tractor , perhaps , he will find one that fits . He can only take this one and see . " Two hours it was , and then three . And while we waited for him to finish another man came to us . An absurd little man  --  tiny , really  --  with a farmer 's coarse hands , a spaniel 's eyes behind wire glasses , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ village , he said , speaking to us in Russian , the mutual tongue . " Eduard here is getting you fixed , I see . " " In his own time , " grumbled Waclaw . " Yes , he 's a good man . Very careful . " He walked around to the back of the truck and looked between the flaps . " You seem to be provided for . " " It 's only bread and some cheese , " Boleslaw told him . " We had nothing to pay . " " Never mind . Men get hungry , do n't they ? " His hand explored the box . " And the wine ? " " The same , " Boleslaw said . " The fellow sent us to another place . A woman had to go for it , but she gave it willingly . " " I 'm sure . " He let the truck flap fall . " And where was that place ? " " The name ? I do n't know , " Boleslaw told him . " It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the committeeman said . " That 's a pleasant woman . " He came around the truck , limping , and sat down on a low bench with his cane across his knees . " And when your truck is repaired ? " I saw no harm to say . " To the capital . Our unit was going there . " " I see . " His hands opened and closed around the cane . " To the capital , of course , is a long journey . But back to the border is only a little way . " " Go home ? " I thought I had misheard him . " The machine ? " he looked at the truck " ? perhaps it is weak . Who can say ? If it were to stop again you might be less lucky . And you are how many ? Six ? " " Haw ! " Waclaw shouted . " He would have us go home ! " " We all know , " said Gabriel , " that the army is very understanding . " " As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I only suggest it . " " I 'm going to the capital , " Boleslaw declared . " There will be parades and afterward maybe girls . " " Look , if all went home , " I said , " who would defend you ? If there were no need , why would we be here ? " " Have you listened to the radio ? " he asked me . " We have none . " " A pity . " He stood . " You would be interested to hear it , I think . Anyway , " he said , " you may remember that I suggested . " And his cane made a wooden clicking on the stones . " We 're told the road is marked , " Waclaw called after him . The man answered without turning . " Plainly . " L ATE AFTERNOON , THEN-still of that first day . The road became a lane , the lane a track , the track a litter of boulders rolled up against a ruined bridge . It was cool in that high place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stream water was pleasant in the boots . " Well ? " Waclaw said . " No road , " I told him , wading back across . " After the bridge , nothing at all . " Boleslaw came from emptying his bladder in the bushes . He had opened the wine . " Where are the girls ? " he said . " I do n't see them . " Gabriel sat smoking beside a tree . " What kind of driver are you ? " he said to Waclaw . " All right , all right ! " " ? to be stopped by the absence of a road ? " " Never mind , " I told them . " The question is how we went wrong . Which place ? Do you know that ? " " It has been too long , " said Gabriel . " I was just a boy . But it was no road like this . " " How many turns did we make ? Three ? " " Four , I think , " Waclaw said . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gabriel . " Well , I would trust a sign before a smart Jew . " " Good for you . " The evening on the mountain yellowed as the sun fell below the trees . We had lost the day . " Turn it around , then , " I told Waclaw . " We 'll go back  --  what else ? " " There was a farm , " he said . " I think no more than a few kilometers back . " " Farm girls are best , " said Boleslaw . He was happy to be lost . " How is the wine ? " Gabriel asked him . " Foul . But very strong . " " Keep it . I 'll have water , " Gabriel said , and drank from the cold stream as the truck was backed and turned . In fact it was nearly thirteen kilometers , the last of those in failing light , and then the place was empty  --  not a farm at all but a ruined forester 's hut . As I recalled , the road beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Waclaw said . And was answered by tapping on the window behind . It was Gabriel . " Are we stopping ? " he asked . " Get out if you like , " Waclaw told him . " We have a sick man . " " Boleslaw , is it ? How much did he drink ? " I asked . " The bottle . He cramps and can not sit . " " Shut it off , then , Waclaw . Here is as good as any place . " And we went in and dragged fallen boards from the floor and made a place in the but for some of us . For myself , I preferred the open , among the trees . Boleslaw suffered too publicly . By now , I judged , the liberation would have been accomplished . And we had missed it all  --  the denouncing of reactionaries , the people 's rejoicing . To see the thanks in the faces of the people , that would have been the best . Hearing accounts of it would be a poor substitute . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rode above the trees . A cold dew came down . I noticed that Boleslaw 's moaning had stopped and I went to him inside . He was resting comfortably but awake . " It 's better , then ? " " The hurt is gone . " His voice , although relieved , was still a dry whisper . " You drank too much , you know . " " Not too much . Too rancid . " " The same result , " I told him . I felt obliged to sound stern , and it impressed him . He licked his lips . " Will there be consequences ? " " Probably . " " For me ? " " For all of us , I think . " He let out his breath tiredly . " Never mind , " I told him . " The fault was n't yours . We had missed it already . " " Yes , I remember . We took the wrong road . " He was reassured . " Anyway , we 'll go tomorrow . " " Too late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Taken ? " He laughed thinly . " Who do you think ? The girls . " We slept then , chilly on the mountain . Once I woke to put on my boots but found them still wet . So I wrapped my feet in my coat . And then , again later , I dreamed my name was spoken , dreamed a hand on my arm . Mercifully it was Gabriel . I could not have found my weapon in any case . " He 's blind , " Gabriel said . And I lay down . It was a dream after all . " Jozef ? " The hand shook me . " Do you 80 hear ? I believe Boleslaw is blind . " " It 's night  --  dark , " I said . " He called , I went to him . I struck a light to look at him . Held it to his face . " " Yes ? " " He asked if anyone was there . " w E HAD TAKEN the wrong way . Inexplicably , for the marker was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And past that a short distance was another village , smaller than the one of yesterday . We asked them for a doctor and they came with a midwife . " You 're going where ? " she asked . " To the capital ? It 's better that you ask there , I think . I have no remedy . " " How far ? " Gabriel asked her . " Some few hours . " " On this road , is it ? " " Ask the men . " Gabriel spoke to one of with a kerchief knotted at was some conversation . asked the man at the answer . " He says it is not the best road , but it is a road . He has gone there this way . " " Will the truck pass on it ? " Waclaw asked . " He says so . " " Ask him if any tanks have come this way , " I said . " I did , " Gabriel told me . " And he said yes , but it has been thirty years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no discomfort now , but deeply affected . Because the way was rough , we stopped often to look to him . He was able to do nothing for himself , and made requests of us in a small and whining voice . One could imagine his horror , and yet it tried the patience . The road led northward through a young forest and past an open pit mine , unworked . And down , then , across a pitch of grass to a long reedy meadow that became immediately a marsh into which the truck , with a slow side-ward lurch from the slippery track , settled down onto its undercarriage . Waclaw , his hands on the wheel , stared blankly out through the front glass . I shut off the engine and got down . Gabriel was out already . " So , " he said . " We did as well as the tanks . " Across the nodding crest of reeds there was a rusted turret . And beyond it another . " The track must go to someplace , " I said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " From up above  --  did you see it ? ? there was another going to the left ahead . " I raised the canvas at the back . " You , Zenon , and Jerzy . Go with Gabriel , eh ? We will find someone to pull this out . " " And him ? " Jerzy looked at Boleslaw , who lay in delicate stillness , as though by pretending death he might escape its notice . " Boleslaw can watch the truck  --  stay with it , I mean . " He moved his hand in a little flutter . " You are no worse ? " I asked him . The hand fell back . " The same . " Waclaw came out , too , then . Broken-spirited , past being angry . " What now ? " he said . " We 'll pull it out . " " But how ? " He was hopeless . " With a tractor , of course . " " Well , maybe . But I do n't think so . " " Of course we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go on one track and you and I on the other . We 'll find someone . " And did . Beyond the marsh a boy was pull . ing a wagon of straw . He unhitched the wagon , and left it there , and turned down the track with Waclaw and me standing beside him inside the tractor 's tires . And Waclaw , without any excitement , said to me , " Look , now . They 're burning my truck . " From across the reeds a column of oily smoke stood against the trees behind . " Probably the others have found someone and lit a fire to tell us . " " A fire like that ? " he said . A ball of flame leaped up into the smoke . There came to us , over the tractor 's noise , a heavy , windy sound as of a rug being shaken . With a fright I remembered Boleslaw . The boy stopped the tractor and we ran ahead . And , yes , it was the truck . But Boleslaw lay on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . " They took me out . " " Who did ? " He shook his head , fingers fluttering limply in front of his closed eyes . " I had not even smelled smoke . I might have burned with it , " he said . " It 's lucky for me they passed . " Waclaw snorted and turned away . " What did they say to you ? " I asked . Boleslaw shook his head again . " Just lifted me out and put me here . Very considerately . " " How admirable , " Waclaw said . Quickly the burning was finished . The metal made sounds as it began to cool . " Well , " Gabriel said , " who cares to go walking with me now ? " The others looked at him . " Walk where ? " I asked him . " Home , I think . Where else ? " " The thing is to find another car , " I said , " and continue on . " 82 " As you like , Jozef @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and no joke this time . " " Without arms ? " Zenon said . Their weapons in the truck had been taken or burned . There was only my pistol now . " It ca n't be helped , " Gabriel told him , and shrugged . He smiled . " I have this honest face . " Jerzy Rozek , too , was tempted . " But which way ? " he said . " We 're lost , I think . " " Not lost , " said Gabriel . " We only took the wrong roads . We came to the west , so to the east  --  as we 're facing  --  must be the long valley again . And to the right will be the frontier . There can be no mistake about that . " " It is deserting , " I told him . " You will report me , eh ? You , Jozef ? " " What do I care ? No . But it will surely be discovered , " I said . " I will report myself , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they will commend me for my intelligence , I think . " So the three of them went , Gabriel small in front . Whistling , striding gaily , he led them down the wet track between the reeds past one of the ruined tanks and out of the world . " I would like to go , " said Boleslaw . Envy stirred in him . " Tonight they will be drinking beer . " And perhaps they were , but it was not in this life . I THINK IT MUST BE a most remarkable thing to find a gun pointed at oneself . But no less extraordinary I may tell you  --  in case you have not had the experience  --  to do the pointing . Indeed , the man in the car seemed quite composed  --  more curious , I thought , than frightened . He stepped out , leaving the door open behind him , and looked at the piles of stones we had rolled onto the road . " What 's this ? " he said . In the back of the car there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who leaned across . " Are they robbing us ? " she asked . " I do n't know yet . " " Well , ask them . " He was impatient . " If you please ! It 's what I 'm doing . " She made a little gasp . " Is that one hurt ? " Boleslaw had bound a white handkerchief around his upper face  --  uselessly , of course , but with much dramatic effect . " Yes , madam , " I told her . " He 's lost his eyes . " " Lost them ! " " The use of them . " " Dear , dear , " she said , and clucked her tongue . And still , as nearly as I could tell , neither of them had really noticed the pistol . " We want your car , " I told the man . " What is it ? " she called from the other side . " They want the automobile . " " But that 's impossible . Do n't give it to them . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Tell them they ca n't have it . " The man threw up his hands suddenly and I nearly shot him . But he only turned his back and paced a step away . You should give it gladly , " I told him . " Then why are you pointing that ? " So he had seen the gun , after all . " I do n't know , " I told him , and it was true . In my innocence , it still was true . " What would you have us do ? " the man said . " Well , when we have gone you can roll the stones across again . Someone will stop , and may take you . " " And my car ? " I had n't considered . " Suppose we leave it with the police in the capital . " " Please , then . You will give me a paper saying that you have taken it . " And he wrote it out , with scritching pen , on the back of an envelope . " Sign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He insisted that it was necessary to lie down . Waclaw started the motor . " You must use the brake like this , " the man said , leaning in to Waclaw . He pumped twice with the flat of his hand . " Yes . " " And sometimes the second gear will not go . Please do not grind it . " " All right . All right . " Behind us , as we went , the woman was gesturing furiously . The man sat on one of the larger stones and was not looking at her . T HE ROAD BORE DOWN upon a small river , dark-bordered with trees , where a cable ferry nosed to the bank . On the near side was the ferryman 's house and , before that , a small guard 's but with a hinged barrier across the road . The soldier came out sleepily , his rifle slung at his back , and yawned as Waclaw braked the car . He looked inside at Boleslaw on the seat . " An accident ? " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had no papers , of course . Nor was there any frontier . " For the car , " he said . " It is a customs post . " At least this soldier had had some schooling , so that , as with the man on the road , it was possible to converse . 1 explained about the truck , and that the machine was borrowed . " One minute , please . " He went inside and turned the arm of a telephone , spoke into it , and then came out again . The ferryman had arrived , too , from the house  --  an old man in boots and country clothes , with yellow hanging mustache . " Where is there food on this road ? " Waclaw asked the soldier . It was past noon . The guard looked at the old man . " Ahead what is it ? One hour ? More , I think . Nearer two . " " A long time , " said Waclaw. disappointed . " 1 think so . " " Unless . . . " Waclaw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Unless this fellow could give us food . What do you say , eh ? " The old man looked at his shoes . " You have a wife , do n't you ? Ask her , then . " " We ca n't pay , " I told the old man . He turned to the house . " It can be anything , " Waclaw called after him . " Just something small between bread . Anything that fills . " The ferryman said nothing , but went with slow resentment . I looked to Boleslaw , then . His coat was rolled beneath his head and his legs were curled to fit the seat . I asked if he slept . " Would you ? " he said , whining . His voice was like a bird 's . I left him . Waclaw was telling the soldier about the truck  --  how we had come to lose it . " But they ca n't blame me , " he said . " You agree , do n't you ? " The guard raised his eyebrows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say ? " " I know , " Waclaw conceded . " In the army , who can say . " The old man came back with a sack . " Do you carry weapons ? " the soldier asked . " Only this pistol , " I told him . " The others burned . " , " May I see it , please . " He turned it in his hand . " Seven millimeter ? " " Yes . " " And the papers for this ? " " Papers ? " I said . " What papers ? It is the army 's . " " I see . " He looked at it and seemed uncertain . " One minute . " He went in the but and rang the telephone again . When he came out he did not have my pistol , and his own rifle was unslung . " Pass now , " he said . " It 's all right . " " My gun . " " That stays . It 's the regulation . " The barrel of his rifle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't make the orders , do I ? " As Waclaw had observed , one army was much like another . " So , " he said , " if you will get in the car you may cross . " Waclaw took the sack from the ferryman and was opening it . " Cross first and eat beyond , " the soldier said . " It is nicer there . Besides , the old man has come from his own meal . " He raised the barrier and Waclaw rolled the car down onto the narrow platform . It was a ferry for one car . The gasoline engine started , fuming blue , and the ferry swung out on its cable . The flow was gentle and quite clear . Below , among the bent weeds , fish fled the shadow of the boat . Waclaw got back behind the wheel and drove up the embankment to a level place of grass . " We 'll be there tonight , you think ? " he asked . " Probably . " I was worrying about the gun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no hurry . " He took the sack from between his feet and got out . " It was foolish to let him hold it , " I thought aloud . " What difference ? " Waclaw said . " We 'll say it burned with the others . Man , what is a gun , anyway . When we 've lost a truck . " That was true . The little ferry nosed across to the far bank , the racket of the engine stopping with a final breath of blue smoke that passed slowly down across the water . The old man made fast his rope and started to the house . We sat Boleslaw against a tire of the car , where a spot of sun fell pleasantly through the leaves , not hot at all for the season . The place was very still , with the river passing . Waclaw gave a sudden little cry . " See it , will you ! Do you see what is between the bread ? " It was the turd of a dog . White , calcified nearly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water 's edge , screamed at them . Howled at them . Most remarkable sounds . " Do n't complain , " sad Boleslaw told him . " Be thankful you have eyes to see to eat . " " They hear me , " Waclaw said finally , panting . But no one appeared . W ACLAW , IT WAS , who wanted to stop . I preferred to continue through , and spoke against it , but his appetite consumed him . We sat a quarter of an hour at the table beside the window while the woman carried foaming beers to the others . Finally Waclaw slapped with his open hand on the wood of the table . Loudly . " For me , " he told her , " the pork . " She shook her head . " Finished , the pork ? This cabbage , then . " " Finished , " she said . Everything was finished . It was suddenly quiet in the room . " And the beer ? " Waclaw said . The taverner had just put four glasses on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curtain . " Is that finished , too ? " The taverner nodded . " The last , these . Finished . " He had dropped his hands below the counter and looked out levelly , a man prepared . In such a circumstance , one leaves as one must ? politely . Outside , a boy was crouched beside the car tire , beginning something . Waclaw jerked him up by the shirt and the boy 's knife clattered on the street . " Go ahead ! " the boy cried at him , weeping and laughing together , rolling his terrified eyes . A stone struck Waclaw in the small of his back and , turning , he dropped the boy with a grunt . Another stone bloodied his mouth . The next went past my head . Schoolboys , book-straps on their shoulders , advanced in a skirmishers ' line . The windscreen of the car shattered inward . The machine leaped forward under Waclaw 's foot . The skirmishers let go a last volley , then skipped aside . Except one . His small arm went up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car . He nearly fell in upon us . hung on a few yards , snagged on the windscreen , then slipped back across the car 's top . I turned to see him rolling after us over the stone , a limp thing . " Hnnnnn , " said Waclaw , his voice rising in his nose . " Was there something in the road ? " asked Boleslaw . The last houses of the village rushed past . " Faster , " I told Waclaw . " You saw , Jozef ! He jumped in front . " " Never mind . Go faster , " I told him . But to no point . When you race a car against a telephone , the wire will always win . " What now ? " said Boleslaw in his little voice . We were stopped on a rise . Very far ahead in the deepening afternoon were the roofs of a town . And , nearer , objects on the road . " Binocular ? " Waclaw said . But mine had burned . " In my kit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wheel and adjusted the glass . " Carts , " he said . " Two carts . And men with them . " He gave me the binocular . The tines of their hay forks shone dully in the failing light . I counted only two guns  --  old guns , for shooting birds . Waclaw backed the car down over the rise . " Maybe we can ask them to direct us , " Boleslaw said . " Shut up , " Waclaw told him . " We 'll have to go back , " I said . " To where ? I watched  --  it 's the only road , " said Waclaw . " But we can go through , I think . " " Through ? " " They are only carts . Wooden ones . Why not ? " In the truck , yes , I would have tried . Might have . But in so small a car ? " Please yourself , " Waclaw said . His face glistened with sudden sweat . Boleslaw let me help him from the seat , making himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tile pipe where a dry stream passed out of a field and under the road . " What if they have dogs ? " Waclaw said . " Maybe they wo n't . Soon it 's dark . " I put Boleslaw , complaining , in the tile , making him leave a place for me . And then went up to the top again and lay with the binocular . Surely Waclaw meant to do it . Quickly the distance closed . Far away , and entirely without sound , the one gun put out a white smoke . And then the other . He was through them , then , the car holding true on the road . But slowing , stopping finally a quarter of a kilometer past . I saw him roll out onto his knees . The men were running . I went back to- the tile and crawled under the road with Boleslaw to wait for night . " Waclaw passed through them ? " he asked . His voice was loud in the pipe . " No , I do n't think so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Just some people , " I told him . " Only the people ? You see ! We should have gone with Waclaw . What difference if we had been stopped ? " Already it was dark inside the tile . I lay sweating too , now , begging God there would be no dogs . " How did they greet him ? " Boleslaw asked . In mercy 's name , I saw no cause to tell . T HREE DAYS MORE we were traveling . On the second Boleslaw claimed to see light and dark . That night , it seemed , he crept with less support . And in the morning he could indeed see , if only shadows . His old spirit returned . " The girls are waiting , " he said . " For me . " And was impatient with lying in the bushes . I had to steal a chicken , finally . We had come to that . I took it from its roost before dawn on the low branch of a tree too near afarmer 's house . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Running , frightened , I stumbled in the grass and let it make a mess of me . After light , when our fire would be less noticed , we cooked the chicken under a bridge and ate it there and slept . At least Boleslaw slept . I was trying to think how we might pass safely into the city . We could perhaps remove our shirts and go as laborers . " For what ? " he said , when I suggested it . The dust stuck in the chicken grease made a brown circle of his mouth . " Our enemies will be finished now , " Boles-law said . " Surely so . " " They are all the enemy , " 1 told him . But of course he would not believe . " Call them anything , " he said . " Tomorrow by this time I will be between the legs of one of them . " That night we followed a main road , staying well out in the field beside it , until the light of the city seemed quite near . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little grove above the road . There , unwisely , I slept , and on waking saw that it was morning and that Boleslaw stood plainly in the road below . In the road . Smiling . Calling to them . I rose to save him . And would have , except that there were bicycles approaching . Many men on bicycles . I made myself small on the ground between the trees to see . But the bicycles only parted and passed around . A military car came then  --  not one of ours . It stopped ; the soldiers got out . They looked up into the grove . Boleslaw fool or betrayer  --  was bring-ing them to inc . There was no time to run . I lay face down in the leaves and the dirt , tasting decayed things , being small . Waiting for the shots and trying not , as my last act among men , to foul myself . Hands turned me over . The enemy 's face was near , but I dared not look . " This one is shot ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurt . Such blood ! " They lifted me , carried me . I thought I fainted . ND FOR ALT , OF THIS We were covered with honor . In absolute truth , armies can not be explained . But many medals were given during that time , and the reasons for them will not be remembered . Suffice , finally , that they were given . So why refuse a bit of brass if it is offered ? That is Boleslaw 's view of it , and Boles-law is a realist , " Keep a medal long enough , " he says , " and the glory will come . " ?
