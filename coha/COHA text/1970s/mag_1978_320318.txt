<P> Over the past eight years the World Council of Churches has given $2,640,000 to groups that oppose " racism . " More than half went to black organizations in southern Africa that have used guerrilla violence in trying to overthrow white minority regimes . The revolutionary grants program began when the W.C.C. general secretary was Eugene Carson Blake , a liberal U.S. Presbyterian with a flair for politics . It was controversial from the start , but the W.C.C. easily lined up enough backing from its 293 Protestant and Orthodox member denominations to fend off critics . <P> Now the Program to Combat Racism is in hot water again . Reason : a recent grant of $85,000 to the radical Patriotic Front , which is seeking to bring down Rhodesia 's tottering biracial government and has been involved in ugly killings of unarmed civilians . The W.C.C. has been hit with a fierce wave of church protest . <P> Last week the council 's Executive Committee conferred at the Hanasaari Conference Center near Helsinki . After closed-door sessions , the jittery officials issued a terse endorsement of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intense debate over a further statement to be issued this week , and about a bold plan to grant another $85,000 to the Patriotic Front . <P> That would inflame an already tense ecumenical situation . The Salvation Army has quit the W.C.C. , at least temporarily , to protest the grant . There has been an " enormous disturbance " in British churches , says one Executive Committee member . As for West Germany-which now provides 42% of the budget for the financially pressed W.C.C.-official protests are muted , but one top churchman reports " bitter reaction in our churches . " At the recent meeting of the world 's Anglican bishops , a routine W.C.C. support motion got through only with an antiviolence rider attached . In the U.S. , important elements in such W.C.C. member groups as the United Methodist Church , the United Church of Christ and the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese are upset . <P> A standard , but erroneous , defense of the grant is that it was meant not to offer a " political judgment , " as London 's Sunday Times put it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are cared for just beyond Rhodesia 's borders by the revolutionary Patriotic Front . Opponents of the guerrillas argue that many of the refugees were forced to flee Rhodesia by Patriotic Front troops . Even if that is true , there is no doubt that many women and children in the camps are in a pitiable state and that their need for Christian charity is overwhelming . <P> Traditional W.C.C. refugee assistance , though , is provided by the council 's nonpartisan and respected relief commission . Funds are given through the antiracism program to make a political statement . In an explanatory document , the World Council attacked Rhodesia 's so-called internal settlement between blacks and whites , arguing that it " leaves the illegal white minority regime in effective control and gives it a veto over real change for the next decade . " As it happens , two of the four leaders of the Rhodesian regime are W.C.C.-related black clergymen , Bishop Abel Muzorewa and Ndabaningi Sithole , themselves recipients of past grants .               @ @ @ @ @ @
