Unfashionable as it has become , the word charisma may have to be revived to describe Arkansas ' new Senator Dale Bumpers , 49 . He is so charismatic , in fact , that a lot of people , to their sorrow , have had trouble taking him seriously . " Dandy Dale " they have called him , " the man with one speech , a shoeshine and a smile . " But the smile has turned out to be deadly for his opponents , who never quite knew what hit them , so disarming was the weapon . Today , Bumpers is considered the most promising politician in the South-a region that , as it moderates its once extremist politics , is fast rejoining the mainstream of the Democratic Party . <P> Coming from political nowhere in 1970 , the likable lawyer from the hills of Arkansas surprised everybody by defeating former Governor Orval Faubus in the Democratic gubernatorial primary . He then trounced the Republican incumbent , the late Winthrop Rockefeller . He easily won a second term in 1972 and then toppled the Senate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last spring . He collected 85% of the vote last week against his outclassed G.O.P. opponent , John Harris Jones . <P> Bumpers ' campaign style is awesome , even in the tall-tale-loving , flesh-pressing South . He did not just shake a voter 's hand and pass on . He found out the man 's name , rolled it over his tongue a few times , inquired about his relatives and , more often than not , produced a better-than-average anecdote about a mutual acquaintance . He was careful to stick to his political ground rules : never attack an opponent , never start an argument , never take a stand on an issue when it can be avoided . <P> With this breezy approach to his political duties , Bumpers might be expected to be an indifferent administrator . On the contrary , he compiled one of the best records as Governor in Arkansas history . During his two terms , he reorganized the state government into more efficient cabinet units at a saving of $235 million . At the same time , he raised teachers ' salaries by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increased the number of blacks employed by the state government from 7.4% to 19% . <P> Bumpers decided to run for the Senate partly for financial reasons . He and his wife Betty have three children ; one daughter has a serious spinal condition . As a Senator he will make $42,500 a year instead of the penurious Arkansas Governor 's salary of $10,000 . Beyond that , he is intensely ambitious , and it is presumed that he wants to be nothing less than President . A few years ago , that would have been an impossible dream for a Southerner , but no longer .
