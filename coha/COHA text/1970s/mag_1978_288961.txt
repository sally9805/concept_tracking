NGU , the most common VD <P> To most people , venereal disease means either syphilis or gonorrhea . But , in fact , the most common venereal disease in America today is one that has been so overlooked by both the public and doctors that a British expert has dubbed it " the Cinderella of sexually transmissible infections . " The clinical name of the Cinderella disease : nongonococcal urethritis , or NGU . <P> Urethritis is an inflammation of the urethra , the channel carrying urine from the bladder . In gonorrhea victims , it is caused by the gonococcus bacterium . But in a majority of cases of NGU , no gonococcus can be found-hence the name nongonococcal urethritis . Though the cause of NGU can not always be determined , researchers have in recent years identified a culprit in about half the cases : a tiny bacterium called Chlamydia trachomatis , the same microbe that causes trachoma , an eye disease . <P> Chlamydial infections usually produce mild but recognizable symptoms in men : pain during urination and a clear , watery mucoid discharge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; chlamydia can remain unnoticed in the cervix , producing no apparent symptoms . Left untreated , the infection may lead to serious complications . Men can develop inflammation of the epididymis , which carries sperm from the testis . In women , inflammation may occur in the cervix or the fallopian tubes ( which can become blocked , causing sterility ) and other pelvic areas . Even worse , the infection can be passed on to babies during birth , causing eye infections and pneumonia . Says Epidemiologist Julius Schachter of the University of California at San Francisco : " Five percent , at a minimum , of all newborn infants are exposed to these organisms . Forty percent to 50% of all babies passing through an infected cervix acquire chlamydial infection . " <P> Public health experts say that NGU is increasing at an epidemic rate , far faster than gonorrhea . It is now the most common sexually transmitted disease in developed countries . Though the true incidence of NGU is unknown in the U.S. , in part because physicians here are not required to report cases , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 9 million Americans are afflicted . NGU is noted most often in young , single , sexually active whites from the middle and upper classes . Says Dr. William McCormack of Harvard Medical School : " Almost all of the urethritis that is seen in college health services and in private practice is nongonococcal . " <P> Despite the NGU epidemic , gonorrhea , which generally attacks the poor , blacks and other less privileged members of society , receives swifter and more comprehensive care . The reason , in part , is that the symptoms of NGU , though uncomfortable , are generally relatively mild compared with those of gonorrhea ; male victims sometimes feel they can defer medical attention . Women are usually unaware that they are infected . Doctors , too , are at fault . Some still are not familiar with NGU and confuse it with gonorrhea , resulting in inappropriate treatment .
