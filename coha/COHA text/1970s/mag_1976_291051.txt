He is the prototypical Midwesterner - big , bluff , hearty , unassuming , everyone 's favorite neighbor . Gerald Rudolph Ford Jr. - Eagle Scout , football hero , Yale Law School alumnus , 13-term Congressman , House minority leader , accidental President - never aspired to the office he inherited . Since Aug. 9 , 1974 , his strengths and faults have been on public display . If what makes Jimmy Carter tick still remains obscure to millions of Americans , Ford is no secret to anyone . <P> At this stage , Ford is unlikely to change his basic careful , conservative philosophy , but he has grown in office . He is less narrowly partisan than he was . Exposure to national and international problems has broadened his perspective . He no longer feels uncomfortable in the presence of such world leaders as West Germany 's Helmut Schmidt and the Soviet Union 's Leonid Brezhnev . <P> Ford is not often angry , but he is more easily irritated now than he was two years ago . He has realized the neccessity of rationing his time ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his pipe firmly in his teeth-a sign of smoldering irritation . His infrequent outbursts are set off by issues that challenge his convictions . He startled an aide a few months ago by denouncing , in barracks-room language , Congressmen seeking to abolish covert activities of the CIA abroad . <P> Still , the friendly man from Grand Rapids has not let the White House go to his head . He would never experiment-as Richard Nixon briefly did - with dressing up the guards in comic-opera uniforms in the hope of evoking grandeur in the European manner . <P> If Ford is perceived as an honest and forthright man , a majority of Americans still do not feel he is a strong leader . After two years as President , he remains the slight underdog in a struggle with a man-all but unknown a year ago-who has no national record at all . Ford is not a dynamic President . He is sound , solid and steady-a known quantity . If his caution prevents him from providing exciting leadership , it also minimizes the risks . His composure is unlikely to crack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while handling the celebrated Mayaguez affair . " We 've got a little crisis , " he said casually to some visitors in the Oval Office . " I do n't know why it is , but these crises always seem to occur on Monday . " <P> But that does not mean he fails to show emotion . On the day that Army I , the presidential helicopter , lifted Richard Nixon away from the White House for the last time , Ford had to struggle to maintain his composure while he watched from the end of the red carpet on the lawn . During the hearings before his confirmation as Vice President , Ford testified in effect that it would not be proper for him-if he became President-to pardon Nixon . When Ford did just that by granting the pardon , he ended his honeymoon with the American people . But he and Nixon had worked out no " deal . " Ford granted the pardon in part to get the Watergate mess out of the way and also because , quite simply , he felt it was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of compassion for the disgraced President .
