<P> Shortly before his assassination in 1968 , Martin Luther King Jr . told his constant alter ego and right-hand man , the Rev. Ralph Abernathy , " Ralph , whatever happens , keep the team together . " Last week , his shoulders sagging and his voice an emotion-charged bass , Abernathy stood before King 's tomb on Auburn Avenue in Atlanta and spoke to his fallen mentor : " I did what you asked . I tried to keep the team together . I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me for resigning this day . I 'll see you in the morning . " <P> After five frustrating years of trying to sustain an activist organization with a rambling , country-preacher leadership style , Abernathy had resigned as president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference . His reason : lack of financial support . <P> In its heyday , King 's S.C.L.C. could raise as much as $2,000,000 for one year 's operating expenses , primarily by skillful use of one of the country 's best mailing lists ( 208,000 names @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public interest in civil rights waned , and this year , after radical staff cuts and a sharp paring of field projects , S.C.L.C. was trying to operate on a budget of $500,000 . Last week Abernathy announced that the organization was $50,000 in debt . He blamed the deficit largely on indifferent middle-class blacks who " feel that they have ' arrived ' simply because they now occupy high positions , but will not support S.C.L.C. financially . " He added : " It is hard to ask for money from white people because you ca n't beg a man and fight him at the same time . " <P> Abernathy also disclosed a rift between King 's widow and the organization he left behind . Coretta Scott King has devoted most of her considerable drawing power as a fund raiser to gathering donations for the Martin Luther King Jr . Center for Social Change , a research library and memorial to her slain husband . A modern four-block complex to be built only two blocks from the dilapidated S.C.L.C. headquarters on Auburn Avenue , the center is expected to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unwilling to share funds with his strapped civil rights organization . King 's onetime firebrand protg , Hosea Williams , criticized her for not sharing $67,000 raised earlier this year at an Atlanta benefit concert featuring Flip Wilson and Jos Feliciano and recorded by RCA Records , with a $50,000 advance to the King Center . <P> At next month 's national convention , S.C.L.C. must name Abernathy 's successor , and already a logical choice looms : Coretta Scott King . <P>
