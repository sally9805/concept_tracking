THE CANDIDATE <P> Directed by MICHAEL RITCHIE Screenplay by JEREMY LARNER <P> California Lawyer Bill McKay ( Robert Redford ) is for clean air , clean water , clean beaches and clean politics . When Lucas , the state 's Democratic kingmaker , discovers him , McKay is in his blue denim shirtsleeves down among the poor , trying to lend a helping hand with some everyday legal wrangles . Lucas ( Peter Boyle ) watches him in action for a while , then makes his move : Would McKay like to run for the U.S. Senate ? <P> McKay has almost impeccable credentials for the job . His ecology speeches and civil liberties record do him credit . He has the good name of his father , redoubtable former Governor John J. McKay ( Melvyn Douglas ) . Furthermore , a visit to Republican Incumbent Crocker Jarmon 's campaign picnic convinces him that Jarmon ( Don Porter ) is an affable fake . <P> With Lucas oiling up the electoral machine , McKay takes his primary contest handily . In the election he gets so caught up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lucas ' tutorials in Realpolitik that he begins gaining points on Jarmon by compromising his principles . At the outset of the campaign , when reporters ask " What about property taxes ? " he replies , " I do n't know . " Later he has learned to refer questioners to complex , five-point position papers prepared by his staff , and to give cagey , vague answers during televised debates . <P> Eventually he trounces Jarmon on the strength of his charisma alone . The last scene of the movie shows him looking conscience-stricken as he rummages about for his shattered ideals . <P> The Candidate might have been a cool and cynical analysis of the contemporary political process . Scenarist Larner was a speechwriter for Eugene McCarthy in 1968 . He knows all the intricacies of political infighting , and the movie deals with such matters competently enough . But Larner never makes McKay believable as a man . All we know about him is that he has something of a communication problem with his father . <P> Director Michael Ritchie borrows heavily from the work of John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ television monitors come straight out of The Manchurian Candidate , where they looked and worked better . Most of The Candidate is constructed around press conferences , windswept campaign speeches and sweaty conferences in back rooms and back seats of limousines , giving the viewer the impression that he is looking at unused footage from a television documentary . <P> Ritchie and Larner stack the cards by making all McKay supporters well-fed suburban liberals or eager youths with a renewed faith in the electoral process . Jarmon 's people are loud , right-wing , wrong-thinking rednecks who are not even photogenic . Neither the authentic political atmosphere nor canny performances by Redford , Boyle and Porter go far to cut through the basic glibness of the film . Ritchie incorporates numerous television political commercials and makes a point of their smooth dishonesty and wily distortion . None , however have less substance than The Candidate .
