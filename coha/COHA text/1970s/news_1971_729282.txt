txt As the Mideast peace initiative launched last month by United Nations middleman Gunnar Jarring marks time , Israel is under increasing pressure to do its part ( as most observers here see it ) to prevent the move trom stalling corniiletely . But whether this is possible is a moot point here . If not , it is widely feared in UN circles that not only will Dr. Jarring 's overall peace mission suffer a serious setback , but also that the danger of a flare-up across the Suez Canal will grow . As seen here , the moment of decision for the Israelis has come . The letters sent by Ambassador Jarring to both Jerusalem and Cairo in early February contained in ques tion form what amounted to a two-pronged peace initiative . ? Egypt in effect was asked to accept the principle of signing a peace treaty with Israel . ? Israel was asked to commit itself to withdrawal to the international boundary between former British-mandated Palestine and Egypt  --  provided satisfactory arrangements could be worked out for Sharm el Sheikh , demilitarized zones , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tieaty and the commitment to withdraw were intended to be simultaneous and reciprocal Frustration to mount ? The danger which UN circles see ahead Ices in the possibility of accumulating frustration in Egypt . both within the current administration and among those young Army officers compelled to passively confront Israeli forces along the Suez Canal . ? lost observers agiee that the Egyptian leaders went out on a limb by committing themselves to signing a peace treaty with Israel -- something former President Nasser never conceded . How lorg can they remain in this exposed position . it is asked , if they gain nothing from it ? // *Israelis pressed on withdrawal proposal Israel 's defenders vigorously dissent from this analysis . They point to Tel Aviv 's welcome to the Egyptian peace-treaty commitment ; they affirm Israel 's readiness to enter into talks on secure and recognized boundaries : but they deride what they see as an attempt by Cairo to insist on a prior commitment to total withdrawal . Concessions claimed It is asserted that Israel has made several major concessions , including : accepting the UN resolution of November @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the method of indirect talks through Dr. Jarring ; going along with the principle of withdrawal from occupied territories . In the long perspective , observers here grant these to be notable steps of progress . But few hide their disappointment that no map with specific proposals for withdrawals is yet forthcoming from Tel Aviv . These critics point out that the Jarring proposal for withdrawal to international boundaries would leave the Gaza Strip on the Israeli side of the line . Egypt , it is said , was dismayed by this , and by the lack of reference to the refugee problem , but nonetheless came forward with its side of the commitment . Now , it is hoped , Israeli Prime minister Golda Meir will still prove willing to take the political risk of " drawing a map " of Israeli ideas on withdrawal . Big Four agree  --  but . . . Meanwhile , Israel has been subjected to heavy verbal pressure , in Secretary-General U Thant 's words , to " respond favorably to Ambassador Jarring 's initiative . " It is known that the Big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the cease-fire , were in agreement on approving Dr. Jarring 's initiative as well as Egypt 's response , and were ready to call upon Israel to be similarly forthcoming . It appears , however , that President Sadat 's pressure on the Russians ( he visited Moscow for two days last week ) persuaded them to pull back from any endorsement of continued quiet across the canal . This effectively torpedoed a joint Big Four communiqu ? . It also underlined Cairo 's determination not to go along with a ceasefire whose main function , from its point of view , was to cement an intolerable status quo along the canal . Chance thrown away ? Thus , while Ambassador Jarring tries to get his initiative under way again , there is widespread disappointment at the triple setback which came to a climax last weekend : the apparent unresponsiveness of Israel , followed by the failure of the Big Four to agree on a constructive precease-fire-expiry communiqu ? , capped by the nonextension by Egypt of the cease-fire . " By their intransigence the Israelis may have thrown away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one somewhat bitter comment . Seasoned Mideast hands are less hasty . They allow several more months for Dr. Jarring to produce results . They point to numerous positive factors ? to both sides ' increasing awareness of the waste of semi-war , to the Egyptian leadership 's seeming determination to readdress itself to Egypt 's internal problems , to the disarray of the Palestinian guerrillas , to the apparently helpful influence of the Soviets ( who would , no doubt , welcome a reopening of the canal ) , to improved Egyptian-American relations . Some are even prepared to look cautiously toward a time when Israel and Egypt are sufficiently far down the road toward agreement for serious talking to begin on the Jordanian , Syrian , and Lebanese parts of the package . All agree that the key to Mideast peace lies with an Egyptian-Israeli agreement . Without it , nothing can be achieved . But it remains only a first step toward achieving a complete peace package . And , at present , momentum toward that first step is seeping away as each side waits for the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
