 | It Pays to Increase Your Worry Power @# F OR YEARS I was just an ordinary , run-of-the-mill circular worrier , like everyone else . No plan , no organization , pick up a worry here , drop another there , never getting anywhere , worry-wise . I 'd head for the grocery store , let 's say , my mind clear as a bell , all ready to plunge into those tricky decisions between the Giant Economy Size at 97 cents and the Super Savings Size at two for 83 . But the car would wheeze windily as it started , which would make me think of the cost of new cars ( high ) and the state of my bank account ( low ) . Thinking about cars would bring on dark concern about the pollution problem , which would lead to fretting about the kind of world we 'll be turning over to the young . By the time I got to the store I could hardly remember why I came , much less divide 11 %Z ounces of tomatoes into 43 cents . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Golden Age of Worry . Worry is everywhere these days , piling up ? more solid , non-bio-degradable worry than most people can dispose of . It 's a kind of mental pollution , and we 're all showing the strain . But then one day I began to discover that , like pollution experts finding ways to turn trash into treasure , I could turn my worry into work . After all , Ben Franklin found electric power at the end of a kite string . James Watt saw steam power in his mother 's teakettle . So there 's 1 IT PAYS TO INCREASE YOUR WORRY POWER rrq  | really nothing unusual in finding Worry Power in the odds and ends of worries hanging around the house . Here is what I 've learned : Concentrate your worrying . Worry power , like steam power , works only when you put a lid on it . I discovered this by accident the day my eldest son got his driving permit . I 'd had a pretty busy summer , worry-wise . Between the state of the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machine kept making , my young daughter 's teeth and my husband 's waistline , I just had n't got around to worrying about my son 's starting to drive . So it was n't until they pulled away from the curb , my six-foot baby boy at the wheel , his father at his side , that the worry hit me . All at once . Talk about Watt 's teapot blowing its top ! I went back in to start my chores , concentrating heavily on faulty brakes , tire blowouts and other things that could happen . Before I 'd run through them all , I 'd waxed and polished all the floors . Then , tensely , I began to review automobile accidents I 'd heard or read about , as I cleaned three closets and my husband 's bureau drawers . Then I turned to special hazards like drunken drivers , jackknifing trailer trucks , and icy patches on the road . ( It was summertime , but worry knows no season . ) When they came back , I had an immaculate house ? and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He 's going to be really good , " my husband reported matter-of-factly . " He 's got the touch . " Then he looked around . " Wow ! It 's the Waldorf ! What got into you ? " Worry power ! It 's the housewife 's greatest help since somebody decided to pipe water right into the house . Worry creatively . Worry does n't have to furrow your brow and wear you out . Used imaginatively it can refresh and restore your strength . My husband took a plane trip recently . An ordinary , foolish fretter would have sat rigidly throughout the trip , listening to the shrieking argument in his brain : " This plane is going to crash . . . . Do n't be silly , of course it wo n't . . . . It will co But my husband , a master at creative worrying , did it differently . Even before he was airborne , he spotted a large rivet which he could easily believe held the whole wing together . It was n't hard to imagine the bolt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thus forcing a crash landing at sea . ( The flight was entirely over land , which just shows you how creative a man he is . ) Such an emergency would demand that some brave , quick-witted passenger ( guess who ? ) would open the emergency door , thereby saving all the passengers ' lives and earning the affectionate gratitude of the friendly stewardess , with whom he would then float cozily in a life raft just big enough for two until ? well , until his plane landed in Toledo . By the time he deplaned , he was ready  | to lick his weight in corporate vice presidents . If we can just break away from the " No it wo n't . . . Yes it will " pattern , imaginative worrying can make heroes of us all . Do n't call it worry if it 's only procrastination . Once , in the middle of the night , I woke up coughing . I realized that I 'd been coughing for weeks . " I wonder if I 'm smoking too much , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm a mess in there . " Through the days that followed , I tried in vain to turn this into worry power , to use it , for example , to help me through two weeks ' back ironing . But I simply stood weakly at the board , moving the iron slowly , slowly , as cigarette ashes fell on the clothes . I finally confided to a sympathetic friend , my fingers shaking just a little as I struck another match , " I 'm so worried that I 'm smoking too much . " " Then quit , " she said . She was right , of course . Whenever you find yourself agonizing over something you can actually do something about , you 're not worrying ? you 're just kidding yourself . Make a list . Most of us walk around with a large , foggy cloud of worries hanging over our heads , some of them old friends , some of them near strangers . If you sit down , make a list and really examine them , you may be surprised . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son , who was camping the Canadian woods . Finally , when I wrote all the faceless worries dow I discovered that " appendicitis a tack " was in the crowd . Since lie ' had his appendix out years ago , discarded that one ? along with " ty phoon , " because you do n't really g many typhoons in the Canadia woods . As I read down the list , kept lightening my pack and feeling better . Another day , weighed down with concerns , I made a two-column list : Worries , and What to Do About Them . My list of worries was a long one , ranging from " war " and " pollution " to " Jeannie 's teeth . " Then opposite each I entered something that was in my power to do immediately : " Write Congressman today " ; " Call Boy Scouts about old newspapers " ; and even that terrifying phrase , " Call orthodontist 's office . " The major worries I carried still , even after the small gallant actions had actually been taken . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into worry power . If we can get our worries working for us , instead of the other way around , we may eventually find ourselves having less worry to work with . But let 's not worry about that until the time comes . @#
