The first TAP Airline jumbo jets begin arriving at Lisbon 's Portela de Sacavm International Airport at 7:55 in the morning . By 10 o'clock customs and immigration offices are overflowing : upper-middle-class professional men with their well-dressed families " on holiday , " civil servants " on extended leave , " students looking for places at Lisbon University , shopkeepers , farmers , nuns , Asians , mulattoes and frightened old people . Pushing a cart piled high with 14 suitcases and carrying a bicycle , Joao Tudo Bern , a civil servant from the Angolan capital of Luanda expressed the prevailing sentiment : " I have six months vacation now , but I will go back and work for the new government-if they do n't throw us out . " <P> No Brass Bands . At Lisbon 's port , the scene was much the same last week as the troopship Niassa arrived , carrying 1,400 soldiers from Guinea-Bissau . There were no brass bands , nor for that matter were there any high-ranking government officials . One by one , as the soldiers were demobilized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cardboard boxes or cheap suitcases with their belongings . Many sported T shuts with pictures of Amilcar Cabral , the assassinated Guinea liberation leader against whose cause they had so recently been fighting . Some , but by no means all , were enthusiastic about returning home . Says Joaquim Pinedo Martins , 22 : " The war was a fascist disaster , but I do n't plan to emigrate . I will find my future in Portugal . " <P> The reverse diaspora from newly independent Guinea-Bissau and the soon-to-be-freed Portuguese territories of Angola and Mozambique could well amount to half a million people before it ends . In addition to thousands of white colonials who are fleeing the territories for fear of violence in the transitional months while political power is being transferred to the liberation movements , 150,000 Portuguese troops are slated to come home over the next two years . <P> Work Force . Their future in Portugal is very much in doubt . The home-bound exodus could hardly have occurred at a worse time for the country 's faltering economy . The country 's work force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rising rapidly . Hundreds of small businesses have closed , and large companies are not expanding . Says one Lisbon businessman with companies in Africa : " We could not employ in Portugal more than a fraction of our people from down there who have asked us for jobs . " <P> Nor will it be easy to find work elsewhere . France and Germany have been tightening up on immigration from countries outside the Common Market . The government is giving top priority to finding jobs for returning soldiers , but , says one economist , " after the first few weeks of euphoria , the soldiers who returned home as heroes will start looking for jobs and finding there are n't any . "
