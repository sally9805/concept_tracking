Now that cigarette commercials are banned from radio as well as TV , some tobacco men are examining a device that can deliver a recorded 20-second commercial from cigarette vending machines . Called ACMRU ( Audio Commercial Message Repeating Unit ) , the new product sits atop a cigarette machine and resembles an illuminated advertising sign the size of two shoe boxes placed end to end . When an unsuspecting smoker puts his first coin in the slot , ACMRU can launch into any one of 16 to 20 spoken messages or singing jingles from a cassette tape player concealed inside . <P> Developed by Castagna Electronics of Brooklyn , N.Y. , the squawk box will sell for about $100 . A. Frederick Greenberg , president of Castagna , is counting on fervid competition among the tobacco companies to equip as many cigarette machines as possible with ACMRUs that will broadcast messages . After all , vending machines dispense an average of 22 competing brands . Greenberg says that ACMRU is aimed at the 250,000 vending machines in " prime high-traffic areas " - mostly offices , factories and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 20 ft. but Greenberg does not think that they will be annoying . " Well , " he says , " you do n't have to stand there and listen to it . "
