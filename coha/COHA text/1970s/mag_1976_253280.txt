A presidential candidate who expects to be taken seriously must convince voters that he has at least a plausible prescription for prosperity . So , no presidential campaign is complete these days without a network of economists to feed the candidate ideas on how to deal with unemployment , inflation and economic growth . The technical ability and political insights of these experts can make or break a campaign-as illustrated by George McGovern 's 1972 economic program that turned into a vote-losing albatross . Moreover , the ideas of the economists who advise the eventual winner can shape the way Americans live and work for years after the election-especially if , as can happen , the candidate 's campaign advisers become the policymakers of a new Administration . <P> The candidate best supplied , in quantity at least , with economic advice is , of course , President Ford , who can draw on the whole policymaking apparatus of the Government . Currently , Ford 's aides are reporting that the recovery from recession is picking up enough speed to weaken what the Democrats had expected to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Other candidates , lacking the power of the White House , must get their advice wherever they can find it-generally from economists at universities and research organizations who have time to ponder major public issues . <P> The candidates seek as broad a spectrum of advice as they can get and choose what they want or what they believe will sell . Frequently economists will advise more than one candidate-indeed , sometimes just about anybody who asks . For example , Robert Nathan , a private Washington consultant and member of TIME 'S Board of Economists , considers himself a regular adviser to Hubert Humphrey , who might well emerge from a brokered convention with the Democratic nomination . But Nathan also has sent papers to at least two of Humphrey 's actively campaigning rivals , Henry Jackson and Morris Udall . Says Nathan : " You help as many as you can . " <P> At this stage of the campaign , most of the candidates are talking economic generalities rather than presenting detailed programs , and their economists are staying in the background . Hardly any have yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they offer their tutelage in a variety of ways : sometimes by frequent personal meetings with the candidate , often through staff members and sometimes only in an occasional phone conversation , memo or quick chat . Nonetheless , their views of the issues-and of the candidates-provide a preview of the fall debate and possibly even some intriguing hints of the economic tone , mood and direction of the next Administration . A brief rundown on the ideas of the leading candidates and the men behind them , starting with the Democrats :
