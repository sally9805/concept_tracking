txt Washington is agog over publication of parts of an extraordinary Pentagon study of the history of United States involvement in Vietnam . But the June 16 Senate vote on the Hatfield-McGovern amendment is not likely to be affected . Secretary of Defense Melvin R. Laird says he has asked the Justice Department to find out how the secret study fell into the hands of the New York Times . Missouri Sen. Stuart Symington , a former Secretary of the Air Force , calls publication of sections of the study by the Times " shocking . " He says the Pentagon twice has refused requests by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , of which he is a member , to see the study , which Secretary Laird says contains some " highly classified " documents . But publication of information contained in the massive study is not expected to influence results of this week 's major congressional vote on the Vietnam war . The Hatfield-McGovern amendment would cut off funds for the war in Indo-China by the end of 1971 . Early this week aides to Sen. Mark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ count no more than 40 firm votes for the amendment ? the same number they were quoting 10 days previously . Observers considered it virtually certain to be defeated . Defeat indicated Several sources actively working for approval of the amendment note indications that several senators likely to vole against the amendment actually are quite flexible in their thinking . They might have been persuaded , this line of reasoning goes , by widespread public insistence on adoption of the amendment . But though there has been some public lobbying , the broad clamor has been absent . " Too much apathy , " sighs one source . Even if the public were to be stirred by the Times articles , and were to conclude from them that senators must be lobbied to approve the Hatfield-McGovern amendment , there was not enough time between the June if initial article and the June 16 vote for any possible groundswell to develop . Thus , it is considered here , the articles would not affect the outcome of the voting . Nevertheless , the articles themselves are causing a sensation throughout high government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ *No change seen in Senate vote // The Pentagon study is a 40-volume , 3,000-page analysis of the growing American involvement in Indo-China from the days of the Truman administration through the spring of 1968 . It was commissioned in 1967 by Robert S. McNamara , then Secretary of Defense . Aid decision related According to the reports in the Times , the Pentagon study concludes that the United States became " directly involved " in Vietnam when the administration of former President Harry S. Truman decided to give military aid to France in its battle with the Viet Minh to retain colonial Indo-China . The study says this decision " set " the path of American policy . The study traces the deepening American involvement through the Kennedy administration 's changing of a policy of " limited-risk gamble " to " broad commitment " ? which gave the administration of President Johnson , the choice between a bigger war or withdrawal . The Times reports that the Johnson administration stepped up the clandestine warfare against North Vietnam , and , early in 1964 ? prior to the North Vietnamese PT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  began planning to wage open warfare . Speedy passage cited The Times began publication of parts of the study June 13 . More than six pages were devoted to articles and what the Times identified as " key texts from the Pentagon 's Vietnam study . " The Times said that " the months from the beginning of 1964 to the Tonkin Gulf incident in August were a pivotal period . " It said that what the Pentagon study called " an elaborate program of covert military operations " against North Vietnam began Feb . J. , 1964 . During this same period , the Times sal. , the Johnson administration was " planning to obtain a congressional resolution that the administration regarded as the equivalent of a declaration of war . " It said that when the Tokin Gulf attack occurred , the Johnson administration obtained quick congressional passage of the " previously prepared " Gulf of Tonkin resolution , without making public that the clandestine attacks against North Vietnam had been occurring .                @ @ @ @ @
