Time , as the afternoon pressed .1 on , was the big factor . Even Texans are n't accustomed to hauling around $2.4 million in literature without a time schedule . The climate was hot and sultry in New York . It was June 21 , 1978 , the day that the University of Texas bought its very own Gutenberg Bible , after making sure that such a fee did little more than dent its oil-rich treasury . To transport the Gutenberg to the Austin , Texas , campus , UT dispatched then Chancellor Charles A. LeMaistre and his executive assistant , Arthur Dilly . University regents had obviously heard that Texas saying about not sending a boy to do a man 's job . The time was 1:45 p.m . The tall , gray-haired man did n't seem nervous as he stood in the small shop on 42nd Street . Because of his slow talk , the clerk probably guessed where he was from as he pointed to the two zippered tote bags priced $12.50 each . Maybe Arthur Dilly did seem in a hurry  --  after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flight to Texas did leave JFK at 4:30 . And there was that mid-afternoon city traffic to fight . As Dilly rushed upstairs with his purchases , he could n't help but ponder the significance of it all  --  historic for Texas , for book and art lovers everywhere , and for all students of education 's progress throughout the world . Not only did these two volumes fulfill a dream of the late UT chancellor , Harry Hunt Ransom , but the $2.4 million seemed a bargain . Of the 200 Gutenbergs printed in the fifteenth century , only 48 are believed in existence . Of those 48 , only 20 ? including the one that came to Texas  --  are complete and in perfect condition . Of the 12 Gutenberg Bibles in the United States , the only perfect ones are at UT , Harvard , Yale , the J. Pierpont Morgan Library in New York City , and the Library of Congress in Washington , D.C. Reposing in the James A. Michener Galleries of the Ransom Humanities Research Center on the southwest corner of the UT campus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bible between the East and West coasts have naturally provoked stimulating comment . Dr. William Burton Todd , UT professor of English and consultant for the Humanities Research Center , feels the Bible stresses the role of the 4 million-volume UT library , as " an oasis in a vast intellectual desert . " LeMaistre and Dilly , now UT director for development and assistant to Chancellor Don Walker , brought the Gutenberg to Texas in a cloak-and-dagger operation rivaling the CIA , the FBI , and even a James Bond thriller . A coldly practical man , Dilly uses one phrase to describe the Gutenberg and its impact ? " instant ivy . " ( Just who coined the phrase is n't clear , since oilman Ralph Spence of Tyler , chairman of the executive committee of the Chancellor 's Council , describes it the same way . ) Today , the Gutenberg draws a steady stream of visitors . Under constant guard , it is spotlighted in a plexiglass case which will be lifted through the years only to turn a page , so that lights will not dim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bibles in Mainz , Germany , during the 1450 's . Even the casual observer marvels at the color , the quality of the rag paper , and the burnished leather cover  --  thought to be the third binding for this particular Bible but itself dating from the sixteenth century . The thought behind such an acquisition by UT is irrevocably tied to UT Chancellor Harry Hunt Ransom , who died in 1973 . A scholar and bibliographer , Dr. Ransom often expressed to Dr. Todd and others his hopes for a rare book cache at the university , and part of his dream was to have a Gutenberg Bible on the campus . He viewed it , as does Dr. Todd , as " a landmark of Western civilization . " Understandably , you do not search for a Gutenberg quietly . Among book collectors and in the market places it must be known  --  almost unobtrusively advertised  --  that a buyer exists who has the money , or who can raise it . The following is how it happened for the University of Texas . On December 1 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chairman of the UT Board of Regents , that a Guten- Tribute to the Father of Printing By Fleur Brennan While $2.4 million  --  the sum the University of Texas paid for its original Gutenberg Bible  --  may seem prohibitive for most budgets , a reissue of the world 's first printed book will soon be available for $87,000 . The facsimile is an ironic tribute to the incredible achievement of its creator , Johannes Gutenberg , who dedicated his life to the invention of printing 500 years ago . The poignant story surrounding the father of printing is seared with greed and ruthlessness , for the genius whose invention opened the magical world of books to millions died a ruined man , cheated by his patron and bankrupted by his innovation , the printing press . Last year German printers began working to reissue the fabulous facsimile , printed by a new photographic process on costly vellum pages made from calf hide . Their earlier plans to print it with metal type using Gutenberg 's original method proved so expensive they had to be dropped , and the issue was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Koehler of Mainz and Idion of Munich have ensured that they will not follow Gutenberg 's tragic path to bankruptcy , because they are also printing 895 profitable facsimiles on paper for only $4,000 each . Dr. Helmut Presser , director of the Gutenberg Museum in Mainz , welcomes the new edition , which will give people a chance to see the beauties of the Gutenberg Bible in libraries and museums the world over . For 500 years , this book has been the crowning memorial to its creator . The details of Gutenberg 's life story have been forgotten with the passage of the ages , but his invention of printing and his Bible have made his name immortal . Born in 1400 , son of a scribe in Mainz , Germany , Johannes spent his boyhood watching his father hunched over his grueling work , painstakingly copying manuscript books for nobles , churchmen , and lawyers . A single Bible took many months to copy . As he watched , the young Johannes found growing in his mind a vision of being able to produce hundreds of pages in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but without the errors that inevitably appeared in the handwritten manuscripts . Like many other fifteenth century craftsmen , he began to search for a way to realize the dream of printing . When he was 28 the Gutenberg family was forced to move to Strasbourg in temporary exile after the Guilds of Mainz succeeded in ousting the patricians . Johannes was by now working on methods of printing and had already sunk a large part of his personal fortune into his experiments . Unable to find fresh capital to finance more work , Gutenberg had to return to Mainz in 1444 . Not guessing that the world would hail printing as a leap forward for civilization , he felt his book had to exceed the beauty of handwritten Continued on page 61 berg was for sale in New York City at the Carl and Lilly Pforzheimer Foundation . Incredibly , three Gutenberg Bibles were known to be for sale at the time , unprecedented in the annals of historic bookdom . The asking price for the Pforzheimer book : $2.7 million . Carl Pforzheimer , who had visited the Austin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harry Hunt Ransom , had died in the intervening years , and the foundation was operated by his son and grandson , who decided to dispose of some of their collection . A short time later , when the price was reduced to $2.5 million , Dr. Todd saw the Bible in New York City and was impressed with its quality . It was generally known among UT faculty , alumni , and other individuals interested in the university that the Chancellor 's Council wanted to do something to memorialize the late chancellor . It was in the summer of 1977 that Dr. Todd appeared before the 45-member executive committee of the Chancellor 's Council , meeting in the Dallas home of Mr. and Mrs. Trammell Crow . As a result , Dr. Todd and his wife , Mrs. Ann Bowden ( who has retained her own name for professional reasons ) , went to New York City in August of 1977 and spent two days examining the Pforzheimer book . " Each of us spent seven hours examining the Gutenberg , " Dr. Todd said . " We looked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of each of the 641 leaves . You know , each page is worth about $6,000 . " The first order of business , then , was for them to report back to the Chancellor 's Council , and the matter did not come up for final , decisive action until the regular Board of Regents meeting in Austin on June 9 of last year . By that time , enough had been going on in the background for Dr. Todd and the others to be encouraged . Ralph Spence had already appeared before the Board of Regents in the spring . He was present again June 9 to tell the regents the Pforzheimer book was a " premier copy . " By this time , the price was down to $2.4 million . At this significant Austin meeting on June 9 , at 1:06 p.m. , the UT Board of Regents gave $2.4 million to buy the Bible ? $1 million outright and $1.4 million to be repaid . The university 's option to buy expired at 4:00 p.m. that same day ! ( Spence is still leading the drive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that same day , Chancellor LeMaistre telephoned Pforzheimer , closing the deal . Then the special problems had to be considered . " Naturally , we wondered how to physically get the Bible to Austin , " Dilly said . " We knew it had to be insured for the trip , so we telephoned the insurance company the university does business with . " The university wanted to know if it could buy travel insurance from 2:00 p.m . June 21 to 9:00 p.m. that same day . They vaguely explained what it was for , then added that they would be leaving New York City from JFK Airport on Braniff International with one stop in Washington and would need the insurance for the value of the baggage only . " That was arranged , and then we knew we would need a bill of sale , " Dilly said . " How do you get a bill of sale for a book worth $2.4 million ? " Attorneys arranged that , too , and when everything seemed pointing to the June 21 culmination of the sale , Mr. and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the acquisition . Then , finally , it was June 21 . Carl Pforzheimer III ( his father was in Europe at the time ) took the foundation 's general counsel , Chancellor LeMaistre , and Dilly to lunch at the Harvard Club , a sedate spot where talk might easily be about rare books , millions of dollars , and things like that . " From the club , we walked with our luggage to a 42nd Street building and took an elevator to the eighth floor , " Dilly said . " To no one 's surprise , a peephole opened and we went in . We signed our names and were led into a 15 by 30-foot room , sort of like . a study . The Bible was on a long , antique table , and once more the pages were counted . It took me about 40 minutes . " Dilly had two checks in his pocket  --  one a State of Texas check for $1 million , signed by State Treasurer Warren G. Harding , and the other a certified check on UT Austin local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the checks , the expected happened . He was incredulous when he saw the million-dollar check signed by Warren G. Harding , Treasurer of the State of Texas . Continued on page 126 manuscripts . This became his ultimate goal . He toiled on to perfect print of staggering beauty and improvise an effective press . At the same time , he had to conceive and build a unique new technique , a technique that had eluded all the medieval inventors until then , of casting individual typographical characters out of metal . This feat Gutenberg achieved by cutting each letter out of steel so that a raised stamp was produced . This stamp was beaten into a softer metal , a block of copper , to form the mold , which was dropped into the base of an ingenious hand-casting instrument . This was closed and filled with soft alloy to make an individual piece of type . The tiny alloy characters , arranged in lines and columns , were kept secure for the printing process by being locked into a " forme , " a rectangle of wood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the type to be broken down and used for another page . By 1448 his credit was so impaired that Gutenberg had to find a relative to stand surety for repayment for him , although the loan amounted to only 150 guilders . However , his powers of persuasion were far from being exhausted , and in the following year he entered into his fateful association with a wealthy Mainz lawyer , Johann Fust . In 1449 Gutenberg received from Fust a loan of 800 guilders , carrying interest of six percent , to be used in completing his work on his apparatus , which was pledged to Fust as security . The typographical process on which he had so long and persistently worked was at last a completely practical proposition . He had already tried his hand at printing pamphlets , leaflets , and indulgences . Now he was ready to begin the most ambitious project of his life  --  the printing of the first book . For the 188 Bibles he planned to produce , 8,000 calf skins were needed for the 30 vellum copies and 100,000 sheets of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ materials , he had to borrow another huge sum from Fust . By now , Fust must have been fully aware of the prime importance of the work , and he consented to the further loan of 800 guilders only if he were taken into partnership and given a share of the profits . At last , in 1452 , the dream became reality and a new era was born . Led by his foreman , Peter Schoeffer , Gutenberg 's enthusiastic employees threw themselves into the task of producing the Bibles . His workshops were humming with activity . Six presses ran simultaneously . The printed pages produced from the presses were everything Gutenberg had ever envisioned . But so insidious was the greed surround- Continued on page 126 Gutenberg Bible continued from page 61 " I had half-way imagined what his reaction would be , " Dilly said . " So we laughed a moment and then laughed even more when I told him he was lucky we did n't buy the Bible a year or so ago . The treasurer then was Jesse James . " Things were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one complication . " The Chancellor and I had figured we 'd be very casual about it all and would fit the two volumes of the Gutenberg in two pieces of luggage under the seats in front of us  --  just like they tell you to do with carry-on luggage , " Dilly said . But the Pforzheimer people had carefully wrapped corrugated cardboard and brown paper around each volume , so much that the Bible would n't fit in the travelers ' luggage . It was 1:45 p.m. , and by previous arrangement three Wells-Fargo men were to be waiting in front of the building on 42nd Street  --  in an unmarked car  --  in just half an hour . The firm on the ground floor of the building probably had not had such a hurried customer in weeks . Dilly knew he had to have two pieces of lightweight luggage quickly , so he bought the first things he saw that were not bulky . The very usual-looking zippered totes were perfect . And now it was time to go . The unmarked Plymouth four-door blue sedan was waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man was in the building , one was outside at the car , and a third was just across the street  --  all in plain clothes . " It was like an adventure movie , " Dilly recalls . " But the traffic was so heavy that no robbers could have gotten to the car , once we got going . Of course , I knew the value of our cargo , but I really was n't worried . " Braniff security took over the job at JFK , ushering the Texans and their two pieces of carry-on luggage to the airline 's private club where they waited to board the plane . The luggage rested right at their feet , and while LeMaistre and Dilly sipped coffee , an incredible thing happened . Dr. H. H. ( Herb ) Woodson , director of the UT Center for Energy Studies and an electrical engineering professorf had been in New York on business and casually walked into the BI club to wait for his plane  --  the same flight . Naturally , he rushed toward LeMaistre and Dilly to greet them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Braniff security men came out of the woodwork , from everywhere . They surrounded Woodson before he knew what it was all about . In fact , he never did know what it was all about until we got to Austin . We just had to be vague about what we were doing in New York . " It seemed like a few days rather than a few hours , and the intrepid travelers had no security at all on the plane . At the Austin airport they were met by Donald R. Cannon , chief of the UT Austin police force , and two other UT officers , all in plain clothes . Casually carrying the two tote bags , Dilly and LeMaistre were taken to UT police head quarters in Memorial Stadium . There , they were met by John Payne , then acting director of the Humanities Research Center . After Payne , too , had counted the pages , the Gutenberg was stored in a vault until security could be assured in Michener Galleries . It went on display in mid-October and can be seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and from 2:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. on Sundays . There is no admission charge . Tribute continued from page 61 ing him , even within his own workshop , that , with almost operatic tragedy , he was denied his moment of triumph . When all but three of the stunningly beautiful Bibles were completed , after four years of printing , Fust foreclosed on the loan . To this day it is a mystery why Fust chose to ruin his partner at the moment when financial success was assured . There was obviously no love lost between the two men . The case against the great printer was heard in the refectory of the Barefooted Friars , Mainz , on November 6 , 1455 . At the outset , Fust demanded from Gutenberg a massive 2,026 guilders . Giving evidence for Gutenberg were two of his trusted printers , Berthold Ruppel and Heinrich Kefer . Through them the court heard that Gutenberg was expecting Fust to provide 300 guilders a year for expenses and also advance him workmen 's wages , rent , vellum , paper , ink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the written contract , he was to pay six percent interest , Gutenberg claimed that Fust had told him he would not insist on this interest . But Fust testified that he himself had had to borrow the money at six percent to finance Gutenberg .
