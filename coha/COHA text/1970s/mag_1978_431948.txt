 | " IAdvertised for a Wife " Can a tall , good-looking , 35-year-old bachelor find lasting love and romance in the New York City subway ? So far , Michael Block has spent $3,100 to get the answer to that rather odd question . Last July , Michael advertised for a wife on the illuminated signs next to the clocks in eleven New York City subway stations . His message and the half-smiling photo he chose to accompany it are above . The real Michael is cleanshaven . " I grew the beard as a disguise , " he confesses . " If the idea of the ad was a flop , I could shave off the beard , walk away from the whole thing and tell people that the nut in the subway was some other guy named Michael . " Was the idea a flop ? Far from it . Michael got 4,000 letters from women eager to ease his loneliness ? and their own . The writers ranged in age from 15 to 50 and included stewardesses , nurses , lawyers , teachers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secretaries and young mothers . Their letters came from all over the world . Nearly all were typed or neatly handwritten . Their tone ranged from straightforward ( " 1 like your spunk ? I hope we meet " ) , to desperate ( " 1 'm ashamed to have to write this kind of letter , but maybe you will understand how awful it is to be alone night after night " ) , to gently self-mocking ( " I feel as if I 'm competing for Miss America , but do n't worry , I 'm not that pretty " ) . The enclosed p graphs , except for a handful of coyly posed n and a few weirdos in bizarre outfits , reflected , overwhelmingly , the nice young woman next door single , divorced , widowed , perhaps with a your child or two . Sweet smiles . Good figures . Wistful eyes . An almost-palpable desire to please . But the outpouring of mail was n't all that Mich got . The ad changed his life . He 's been interview on national network television and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ page and he appeared for 20 hours on a Jerry Lewis tei thon . As a result , he 's become an instant celebn. and has been asked to lecture to singles ' grou participate in panel discussions of love , marriage and life-style , and write a book . And , oh yes , he 's lost his job . Michael had been employed as an advertising salesman for the company that handles the light subway signs on which he so loudly and clearly announced his urge for matrimony . " Your aspirations are now elsewhere , " his boss told him in farewell ? a rather curious reward for a young man who 'd just proved that it does , indeed , pay to advertise in the subway . What about Michael 's quest for a wife ? He ' ' dated about two dozen of the eager applicants for his continued on page 30 @#  | hand , but so far he is still a " But I 've learned an awf he says . " This experience has been an eye-opener . " He learned , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stories they their futile search for love a panionship have a hearth sameness . He learned , for another , appeal touched a raw nerve men and women that released a of denunciations of the sing where lonely city dwellers ga hating the places , yet ret again and again for lack of less cruel , meeting grounds . He learned further that w and men , too , applaud his I for marriage and for the secu a long-term relationship . " love the fact that I believe in riage , " Michael says , looking ished at his discovery . " I 'm a mantic . I think the old values still work . And can you bell it ? people agree with me ! " And finally he learned that if you have too many choices , it 's almost as hard to find a mate a you do n't have any at all . T he thousands of letters in response to his ad pile up on oak dining-room table . They over onto the floor and are sta in bags in the ample closets of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a knockout , with sweeping views and down the East River . He shares it with a frisky , lovable Belgian sheep dog and a shiny new mo for two . " But what good is all of It . Michael asks , flinging out his ar in a dramatic gesture of futility . I do n't have someone to share with ? " Note the theatrical overtones both the gesture and the question because that 's where you get a clue a to Michael and his curious quest . The theater is in his blood . It v. his first choice for a career . H mother was a model and singer b gave it up when Michael , her on ! . child , was born . His parents were divorced when he was 13 . Michael studied acting at the American Theatre Wing school but , when his father refused to support a job hunt on Broadway , he decided eating came before acting . Michael went on to college a : night , tried out a variety of jobs . continued on page 33 @#  | spent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Israel and finally settled into a career in advertising . Along the way , he fell deeply in love twice , but one young woman could n't make up her mind between Michael and her husband and the other proved too Bohemian in her outlook " Those two experiences were terribly important to me , " Michael says . They taught me that I like to be with someone who really cares about me . I want to be loved and to love back . ' But where do you find someone to love you back ? In New in dozens of other cities , where the extended family , the church social , the junior prom and the corner drugstore have failed in their traditional function of matchmaking , young people by the thousands turn to singles bars . Michael made the bar scene for twelve years . He did extremely well at it . And why not ? Tall , personable , well-groomed , dressed in three-piece tweed suits , self-confident , skillful at small talk and well armed with cash and credit cards , he could zero in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walk out with her ? to another bar , to her place , to his place , wherever . " And what did it get me ? " he asks with another of those dramatic gestures . " Somehow , it was never the right girl , never the right feelings , never anything solid or real . " Three events made him decide to go public in his search for a wife . When he joined the subway-advertising firm , his colleagues at his previous job gave him a Dior tie as a farewell gift . Michael was intrigued by the fact that the designer 's name boosted the price of the tie . He began wondering how he could market his own name . The idea stayed with him ? a rebirth of his old dream of seeing his name up in lights . Then he went through an arduous weekend of self-examination in a sensitivity training marathon of the variety known as EST ( Erhard Seminars Training ) . He came out of his self-searching confirmed in continued on page 34 @# @#  | his decision to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telling me how lucky I was . around with a different girl night , " he recalls .

On a sun-warmed Can beach , he realized that now , if he had to change directions . And as if by magic , all the ments suddenly came together head . His daily work involved subway signs . He 'd always w to see his name in lights . He ed a wife . Of course ! Put himself and beliefs up in lights in the subway .

But Mira did not bee Michael 's wife ; neither did Adrie Lisa , Patty , Barbara , Pam , or am the other 20 young women dated so far . " They 're lovely , all them , " he says gallantly , " but right for me . " Who will be right ? " I 'll know , she 'll know , we 'll both know , " says Michael with the shakable assurance of a deep-dyed romantic . ' And we 'll find each other ? do n't worry . " Some would-be wives sent Mich flip replies . A woman in Flo wrote , " I 'll never burn your me because I do n't know how to cook and I wo n't darn your socks ? I just paint your feet to match .
