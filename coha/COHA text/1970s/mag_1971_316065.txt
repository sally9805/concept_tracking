LOVE IN THE RUINS by Walker Percy . 403 pages . Farrar , Straus &; Giroux. $7.95 . <P> Ten years ago , when he published The Moviegoer , it was clear that Walker Percy had emerged as the first major Southern voice in 30 years entirely free of the Faulknerian inflection . That in itself was good news . Yet the particular glories of the book were a tone of voice that combined modern dryness and irony with an almost wanton tenderness , and a languid young hero who drifted from years of daydreaming about love to a gradual awareness of the real thing . Percy 's second novel , The Last Gentleman ( 1966 ) , was also about a vague young man , this one afflicted with occasional amnesia . <P> Subtitled " The Adventures of a Bad Catholic at a Time Near the End of the World , " Percy 's new novel is a rather abrupt departure from the past .

In Love in the Ruins , the population is split into small enclaves of like-minded dissidents : blacks v. whites , knotheads ( conservatives ) v. liberals . Even the Catholic Church has become a trinity of antagonistic sects . Because no one wants to be a repairman , everything has broken down . Superhighways and shopping centers are enjoying a true " greening " ; they are overgrown with weeds . <P> The bad Catholic of the subtitle is Dr. Thomas More , a collateral descendant of the saint . He is also alcoholic , and , at 45 , his health and equilibrium have become very shaky . " At the time that I developed liberal anxiety , " he mourns , " I also contracted conservative rage and large-bowel complaints . " Much of his time is spent mooning over three dizzy young girls whom he loves equally in a rather abstracted way . Deeply skeptical of human solutions , he nevertheless deludes himself that he can heal the modern soul with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Descartes focusing on the pineal gland as seat of the human soul , More constructs a machine that isolates and measures areas of psychic imbalance in the brain .
