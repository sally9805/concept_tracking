Early one morning last week , a Manhattan patrolman walked up to a taxi parked across the street from Central Park . The driver sat slumped over the wheel , apparently asleep . Trying to arouse him , the policeman discovered that Benjamin Rivera , 44 , was dying from a bullet wound close to his heart . The motive for Rivera 's slaying was clear : his changemaker was missing . <P> Rivera was the seventh New York cabby killed by holdup men so far this year , another victim of an increasing number of taxi robberies occurring across the nation . Within hours after Rivera 's murder , Mayor John Lindsay announced a plan-already being tested in San Francisco , Oakland and Los Angeles-to make New York taxis less tempting targets for holdup men . Sturdy , locked cashboxes will be welded to the frames of New York 's 11,700 cabs . All fares will be promptly deposited in the boxes , which the drivers can not unlock . There the money will remain until the boxes are opened at the taxi garage . Drivers will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cab riders educated to have exact-or near-exact - amounts of money available to pay for their rides . Thus , according to proponents of the scheme , holdup men will soon realize that a cab stickup will net them only a few dollars at best , and begin losing interest in taxis . <P> Protected Profits . There is evidence that the lockbox works . In Oakland , where all Yellow Cabs have the boxes , robberies are off by 25% . In Los Angeles , where 758 Yellow Cabs were equipped with strongboxes in July , stickups have dropped by 50% . Philadelphia 's Yellow Cab Co. will soon test the system . <P> Taxi riders , especially those rushing to an appointment or to catch a commuter train with only a $20 bill in their pockets , are bound to be inconvenienced . But surprisingly enough , many cabbies also dislike the strongbox concept . " Now the junkies will hit you on the head and drive somewhere and break open the box , " says New York Hackie Milt Pashkin . San Francisco cabbies refuse to use cashboxes already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are unlocked at the garage . Other cabbies feel that even the lure of a $5 haul is enough for an addict desperate for a fix . Or , as a New York cabby put it , " they might beat up the driver because he 's not carrying enough money . Lockboxes are fine for the owners because they protect the profits . No wonder owners are all for the idea , even though the cabby is n't protected . " <P> Fringe Benefit . Real security , most drivers agree , will come only when all cabs are equipped with immovable , bulletproof screens between driver and passengers ( payment would be made via a tray that would slide between cabby and passenger ) , as well as driver control over back-seat door locks . New York 's experience with the slide-open screen has not been too successful . " On a hot summer night , " says a police spokesman , " what 's a cabby supposed to do-drive with his window shut ?
