I am not what you would call a " man of mystery . " WHEN CANDIDATE LIKES ID pride himself on that . LI As a matter of strategy , as much as of personal style , George McGovern wants what he says and does , even what he thinks , to be just as open as a prairie sky , as plain as Dakota wheat . Instant " knowability " is one of those qualities ( along with " courage " and " honesty " ) that McGovern believes sets him apart from the ordinary run of politician . And one does not have to be around George McGovern long to discover that . mild-mannered or no , McGovern does not consider himself ordinary at all . It is his words that give him away . " People look to George McGovern for honesty , " he will say . Or , " George McGovern is not going to deceive anyone . " McGovern says it so unashamedly ? as if courage , honesty , and knowability were self-evident marks of grace that only a fool or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at first at any rate , to seriously dispute him . Especially when he adds in the next breath that Richard Nixon is sorely lacking in all three of those departments . Again , it is hard to dispute him . Mystery is Nixon , the unknowable Agonistes . George McGovern ? Why , everyone knows George McGovern . Until he became the Democratic nominee , and the country suddenly began wondering just what it had wrought . There really did n't seem too much to know . The man and his life seemed rather one-dimensional ; a relatively straightforward progression up the electoral ladder of success , aided , to be sure . by a formida ble sense of organization and an even more phenomenal streak of luck . Add to that a twanginess of speech , a smattering of radical politics , faint suggestions of soaking the rich , an even clearer implication of " America , First , " and , quicker than you could say " public image . " out stepped the Prairie Populist . Plain ? Honest ? God , he was plain to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be able to say about him was that he was too " nice " a guy to win . No one worries about McGovern 's being too nice anymore ? not since Tom Eaglcton . In a single stroke , the Eagleton affair obliterated that reputation and , in the process , swept away much of the credibility of a man who , in announcing his candidacy , had damned " the old rhetoric , the unmet promise , the image-makers. the practitioners of the expedient . " " I make one pledge above all others . " McGovern had said , backwhen he was riding at 2 per cent in the polls , " to speak and seek the truth . " Now , as the nominee of his party , his first move had been to back his beleaguered running mate " 1,000 per cent , " and then almost as quickly begin clumsily to pull the rug out from under him . The Eagleton fiasco is not the first time McGovern 's rhetoric has gotten him into trouble , nor is it likely to he the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems incapable of delicate phrase ? making , which , while perhaps not disastrous in itself , leads to the impression that he is similarly incapable of delicate judgment . McGovern , after all , is the candidate who would rather " beg than bomb . " He is also , lest anyone forget ( and there is slight chance of that ) , the candidate whc promised everyone in the country a thousand dollars , adding , almost parenthetically , that he was n't at all sure how much that particular scheme would cost . That sort of " candor " can be disarming , but as McGovern has discovered to his considerable regret , it can also be dangerous . For , under pres. sure , even the most " courageous " and " honest ' . politician can be forced to backtrack , and or a number of familiar issues McGovern has back tracked at flank speed . An unkind observer would say that McGovern has opened his own credibility gap . Even a friend would have to admit that a crack or two have appeared . Before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know McGovern ; with the election only weeks away , nobody seems at all sure what to make of him . How certainty gave way to uncertainty and for many . outright distrust says as much about ourselves and the way we judge our leaders a : it does about McGovern . For all the talk of the end of image politics , the presence of McGoverr shows that it is still very much with us . Be cause McGovern seemed so plain , because of the way he talked ( like Liberace , someone said ) because , even , he came from South Dakota , WE seemed to assume that , as a man , he was als ( plain and uncomplex . Which was our usual mis take . McGovern , whatever he might say abou not being a man of mystery , has always been at enigma , a complex maze of principle and expedi ency , who has startled , dismayed , and ultimatel ' confused his friends and followers since the da , he entered public life . cIlE FINAL UNRAVELING of the tangled weave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and , on that score , there is little doubt : McGovern does know himself . He has resolved not wily all his doubts , mundane and existential , but the seeming contradictions in his behavior . He does not seem at all troubled by appearing to be naively idealistic one moment and ruthlessly pragmatic the next ? except , of course , for the political difficulty that his schizoid behavior causes him . It can be said that this is true of any politician , but McGovern , if only because of his oft-stated pretensions to idealism , is a special case . While he may worry , sometimes too much , about what other people think of him , he does not brood about what he thinks of himself . McGovern made up his mind on that subject and a number of others , from the existence of God to the ideal American foreign policy ? nearly three decades ago , while still a graduatestudent at Northwestern University . Since then , he has been more or less a finished product , both personally and ideologically . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and matured . But at base level McGovern remains the same . As one of McGovern 's classmates of twenty-five years ago puts it : " We all started off like George : liberal , idealistic , really confident in the possibilities of life . The funny thing is , though , that of all of us , George is really the only one who remained that way . " That statement is either a powerful indictment of someone who stopped growing even before he got out of school or an awed tribute to someone whose vision so outstripped his contemporaries that he has been merely waiting all these years for them to catch up . McGovern , naturally , prefers to think the latter , and there is compelling evidence to support him , especially in the history of the Cold War and , of course , Viet- Pcberr Prior nam . Being so " right " so often for so long has , inevitably , made McGovern so confident of his powers of prescience that he comes off at times ( usually more in private conversations than in public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your typical , well-adjusted , quiet-spoken egomaniac . " Egotism , of course . is the natural condition of all politicians . But McGovern 's particular self-confidence is breathtaking . What is more , he frankly acknowledges it , even can find virtue in it . When an interviewer asked him once , for instance , whether it did n't require almost a power neurosis to seek the highest office in the land , McGovern did n't hesitate a moment . " I do n't think it requires a power neurosis , " he replied evenly . " As a matter of fact , I would say that anyone in a position to acquire a reasonable understanding of what needs to he done . and who backs away from it . that he is a neurotic . Seeking the Presidency may he facing reality , a willingness to do what is responsible and courageous . " That is more than ordinary ego , even more than ordinary ambition . Behind his words , underlying his entire personality , is an extraordinary sense of righteousness , which not only motivates him but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has to stoop to the chicanery of the working politician . " George likes the money and the fame that comes from being in the public eye as much as anyone , " says one of McGovern 's oldest friends . " But that is not what keeps him going . He thinks he has a message to deliver , and by God , he 's going to do whatever he has to so people can hear it . " Another way of putting it is simpler . McGovern is a moralist . Moral pretensions 11 N SO BEING , McGovern , superficially , at least , is not unlike every President and candidate for President who has preceded him . They were all moralists . Of course , the moralism of some , like Woodrow Wilson ( who , significantly , is the j , President that McGovern most admires , or , indeed , even Richard Nixon ( who , in a remarkable exercise in doublethink , refuses to stop bombing Vietnam because it would be " immoral " to abandon our allies to a " Communist bloodbath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Although their creeds may differ , from religiously defending American idealism one moment to safeguarding the temple of American business the next , the essential moral thrust of their words , if not always their deeds , remains the same . Even so determined a pragmatic realist as John Kennedy could not escape it . Read today , the words of his Inaugural ( " Here on earth , God 's work must truly be our own . . . " ) seem not so much a political program , or even a listing of goals for the nation , as a moral rallying cry ( " Now the trumpet summons us again . . . " ) for a partic ularly chosen people . Americans have always regarded themselves as singularly blessed and destined . And , out a this conviction , they have come to expect Ebel political leaders to be the same ? not ordinar3 men , not even extraordinarily gifted men , bu the embodiment of a fictional American ideal somehow purer , more idealistic , braver , better stronger ? even , and perhaps especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some mo ments in the past 200 years , men have come for ward who fit this description , or , more accu rately , are made , in the public 's mind , to fit this description . The apotheosis of John Kennedy is but the most recent example . Most Presidents , and candidates for Presi dent , never quite meet our expectations , how ever- hard we hope . Nor should it be surprising since , without extraordinary myth-making , the ; are impossible to fulfill . The candidate with pre tensions to moralism , such as McGovern , faces z. double difficulty . While what he promises tria. be literally attainable , and while he may ever do everything he says he will do , he can never ? simply because he must live and operate in real , hard , amoral world ? act with the constan moral courage of his pretensions . The moralist in sum , is doomed by his very moralism to fail The moralism of George McGovern is a specia kind , one that is new to Presidential politics , yet at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has gone before it . Where a traditiona moralist like Nixon makes a great , and appar ently genuine , display of his religious faith , con verting the East Room of the White House int ( a weekly interdenominational chapel , embracinj such well-known churchmen as Billy Graham am Norman Vincent Peale , and even , on one occa sion. addressing a huge outdoor revival , Mc Govern rarely goes to church . His faith is more a free-form sort of humanism than it is a rec ognizable religious creed . McGovern likes a goo drink and is not above laughing at a dirty joke or , indeed , telling one of his own . As the womei around him can testify , he is hardly a prude . Yet McGovern , far more than Nixon , is moralist . Some of the signs are obvious , like th small , hand-engraved plaque in McGovern 's Ser ate office , listing his five favorite passages fror Scripture. * Or the long , often obscure Biblica *They are : " Whosoever shall save his life shall lose it , and wh4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " " What firth the Lord requite of thee , but to d justly , and to love mercy , and to walk humbly with th God . " " Inasmuch as you have done it unto the least of m brethren , ye have done it unto me . " " He who is without sin among you , let him cast tt first stone . " " And as you would that men should do to you , do also to them likewise . " references that choke his speech texts . Indeed . the speeches , more than anything else , give McGovern 's moralism away . The sublime example is the " Come Home , America " acceptance address at the Democratic National Convention . " Come home , America , from Saigon , " the litany begins , " from the evils of racism . . . from the hunger of little children , from the loneliness of the aging poor , from the despair of the homeless , the jobless , the uncared-for sick ... Come home , prodigal America . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the time , the smell of sulphur in those words . But , then , hellfire and brimstone have always been very much a part of George McGovern 's life . His father . who McGovern claims was the most influential person in his life , was a prairie preacher of Wesleyan Methodism , a Bible-banging fundamentalist offshoot of Regular Methodism . The Wesleyan creed was a hard and disciplined one , and Reverend McGovern enforced it with a firm hand . " There were Bible readings in the morning and again at night , and on Sundays George and the other McGovern children went to church not once but four times . Sinful pursuits like dancing , smoking , drinking , going to movies , and wearing lipstick were unheard of . McGovern himself never had much use for Wesleyanisrn 's social strictures , and some , namely the prohibition against movie-going , h ignored entirely . Before he was twenty-five McGovern abandoned Wesleyanism altogether Never , however , did he forsake the uncoil : promising simplicity of its principles , which unlike most fundamentalist theologies , had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

The German philosopher seemed present the best of both worlds : the ethics values of the East , where society overshadowe , the individual , and the more familiar rugged individualism of the West . " George was quit taken with Hegel , " McAninch once said . " H had the wholeness McGovern was looking for . ' Interestingly , liking Hegel and being infatuate , with the Hegelian concept of history never le , McGovern , as it did so many Hegelians , to like wise love Marx . The reason is instructive " George could never buy something like Conn munism , " said McAninch . " He thought it wa too materialistic , " Instead , McGovern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for the Methodist ministry McGovcrn 's intention was to preach the socia gospel of Walter Rauschenhusch , and in th. middle and late Forties McGovern felt there wa plenty to preach about . Though never a pacifist he had been sickened by his wartime experiene. as a bomber pilot and , on his return , deeply dis turned to discover that American foreign policy at least as he perceived it ( " We seem to hav , taken it upon ourselves to run the world , " h , wrote in a letter in 1951 ) , seemed to be offer ing more war , not less . McGovern 's politica moralism was evident in a prizewinning speed he delivered in 1946 for the South Dakota ileac. oratory contest . Called " From Cave to Cave , " i sounds remarkably like some of McGovern ' stump speeches today , both in tone and rhetoric and , like them too , it sometimes resembles sermon more than a speech .

Jesus said John 15:5 , Wit out me you can do nothing . ' Read that 15 ch. of S John and think on those words . Read the 23rd Psal. often and meditate on it . " twenty-four-year-old George McGovern . In place of the " practical men , who scoff at idealism , at spirituality , " and seem interested merely in " the notion of expediency and of material gain , " McGovern proposed a program of " applied Christian idealism . " McGovern never found the idealism he was looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he gave up his studies for the ministry , discouraged . in part , by the worldliness of fellow ministers jockeying for assignments to wealthy congregations . McGovern next turned to Northwestern University and graduate studies in history . As a teacher , he told one of his professors , he felt he might be able to reach a larger audience with a liberal message than he might as a minister . For several years , McGovern found apparent contentment , studying under liberal professors and working in even more liberal political campaigns , including Henry Wallace 's Progressive party bid for the Presidency in 1948 . NE THING that most definitely did not change 11 for McGovern was his peculiar political moralism . One evening , not long after McGovern left Northwestern , one of his professors , a veteran in the campus political wars with him , asked bluntly : " George , what makes you tick ? " McGovern thought for a moment before replying , then finally answered , by quoting a passage from St. Mark , " Whosoever shall save his life shall lose it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall find it . " The credo stayed with McGovern in politics , first as a Congressman , then through the Sixties as director of Food for Peace and later as Senator from South Dakota . In a memo dictated to himself before his successful 1962 quest for the Senate , McGovern wrote : " Make a pact with self ms 1962 campaign ? the highest and most edue ational , inspiring , friendly , and Xtian Christian I can make it with complete Xtian resign ation , in a happy warrior spirit as to the outcome . No tears or joy , win or loose sic and no concern aver possible outcome ? except high-mindedness and inspire as many S. Dakotans as possible . " Such sentiments could be jarring to the more practical men who had to work with him and who found that his high-mindedness often substituted for guud sense . " There was in him an element of childish trust in events or people . " said a former aide from Food for Peace . " He was of the school that the wish is the father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fortune in the belief that goodness would Win out . " Once in the Senate , McGovern was asked in 1970 to write a blurb for Charles Reich 's The Greening of Americo . McGovern gladly complied , composing an effusive endorsement for abook that was being lambasted by serious critics from coast to coast . In a private memo to his staff , McGovern betrayed a somewhat different feeling about Reich 's apologia for the youth culture , one , however , completely in keeping with his personality . " What it boils down to are the simple old values that my father and my Sunday school teachers taught me 40 years ago , " wrote McGovern . " It 's the best of the Judeo-Christian ethic , out of which come the American Declaration of Independence and the Bill of Rights , and I have n't found a new idea in the book . It 's an exciting book , one of the most exciting I 've read . It 's exciting to me because it is what I have believed all my life .... It 's all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affirming the self , but also loving others as much as you do yourself . No more than that ? the Bible never taught me anything more than that . " To hear McGovern talk , one gets the distinct impression that the Bible taught him just about everything , and what it did not say directly , it certainly implied . McGovern , for instance , is most comfortable with issues in which he can discern an almost Old Testament " rightness " and " wrongness , " like the war in Vietnam.Vietnam , of course , is McGovern 's big issue , the one on which he has staked his major claim to credibility and political prescience , and it is not surprising that it should be . For Vietnam is instantly reducible to stark , moral terms , and that is precisely how McGovern likes to understand it : with the armies of right drawn up on one side and the armies of ignorance summoned up on the other . When McGovern is able to frame an issue in those terms , he will act with extraordinary energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one subject on which they never had any difficulty inducing McGovern to do his homework . Invariably , he had done it , and better than any of them . Vietnam was also one of the few topics on which McGovern wrote all his own speeches . He was detailed and , what is more unusual for him , accurate in his facts and statistics . The problem is that when the moral dimension is missing . as it is on most issues , it is difficult to arouse McGovern 's interest , much less his sensibilities . Until recently , lie had a terrible time coming to grips with the complexities of economics for precisely this reason . His major accomplishment in the field was the perennial authorship , since 1963 , of " economic conversion " legislation designed to shift war industries to peacetime use . As issues go , it is hard to name many , with the exception of ending the war itself , that are more important than that . But , even here , McGovern 's interest always seemed to he more about the war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to advise McGovern on conversion says he was never sure just how deeply McGovern believed in the principle or whether he had fastened on to it simply because it seemed worthwhile politically . In any case , the adviser said , " the legislation McGovern proposed was never adequate . " Lately , McGovern has conic , if only out of necessity , to recognize the importance of economies . Still , the going has been labored , as evinced by the confusion over his original tax proposals . The fiasco over the thousand dollars a year for everybody ( which , in concept , was a better idea than McGovern explained it 1 was wholly avoidable . The figures were available , and McGovern had been fully briefed on their complexity . But that was the sticking point . They were too complex . McGovern , by his own admission , likes the broad brushstrokes of policy , not the fine details , The situation became so had near the end of the primary campaigns that McGovern 's economic advisers were specifically instructed to withhold working figures from the candidate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is certainly not one of intelligence . In briefings , McGovern asks good , often pointed questions , though mainly on the political impact of a given option . What seems to be lacking is personal interest . In plainest terms , the subject bores McGovern . Paper does n't bleed HE QUESTION ONE HAS TO ASK is whether such L1 a man makes a good President . McGovern may well be . as Arthur Schlesinger puts it , " the best listener in American politics . " But , as President , McGovern will have neither the time nor the opportunity to 11 manize " every question of policy . Paper , to quote Hemingway 's memorable phrase , " does n't bleed . " and it is paper , very important paper , with which McGovern will almost always have to deal . Then there is the further question of how McGovern will resolve questions to which there is no immediately recognizable " good " and " had " side . A leading liberal theoretician , who has known and worked closely with McGovern for nearly a decade , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his reputation on ? Vietnam , defense spending , hunger , even tax reform ? are easy things , " he notes . " The choices , to a humanist like McGovern , are not difficult . But most things , certainly most things with which a President must deal , often are not a question of choosing between a good and a bad , but two goods or two bads . Frankly , I am not sure how McGovern will do in that situation . " A good argument might be made that , as President , McGovern could leave the technical expertise , what he considers the dull , unimportant work , to his subordinates . But again a potential problem arises . For one of the marks of a great Presidency is the ability to choose subordinates wisely and , once they are chosen , todelegate authority to them judiciously , so it is left for the President to administer the results of their work . On this score , McGovern 's performance has been woefully uneven . On the one hand , he assembled one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On the other . McGovern 's conduct during the Eagleton episode and the subsequent search for a suitable replacement can only he described as tragicomic farce . If the Eagleton matter were merely an isolated instance , a freakish deviation from the steady norm , then McGovern might be excused . But there is every indication that the Eagleton affair , far from being an exception , is part of a continuing pattern . Since he was a freshman Congressman , McGovern has always had difficulty picking good subordinates , even worse problems getting rid of bad ones . For years , his staff was riddled with intellectually weak sisters whom McGovern consistently refused to fire . His own explanation was that their loyalty so and so would " lie down in front of a truck for me , " he would say ? far outweighed their incompetence . The reasons were more complex than that , and , as always , McGovern 's moralism ? his decency , as it is more popularly called ? was at the base of them . Then , as well as now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact , do almost anything to avoid it . Good Christian that he is , McGovern is also a believer in redemption , not only divine but temporal . These two factors , combined with an academic 's distaste for office drudgery , have , to be kind about it , made McGovern something less than the model of the compleat administrator . " I used to think McGovern simply did n't like administering . " said one of his key staffers in the aftermath of the Eagleton fiasco . " Now I think he has a positive bias against any administration at all . " Poor administration explains part of McGovern 's confusing behavior during the Eagle-ton crisis , but far from all of it . At the root of the disaster lay a fatal miscalculation , an assumption born of arrogance and contradicted by every available fact . that when the moment came he , McGovern , could convince Ted Kennedy to do what Kennedy had been saying for more than two years he would not do . When Kennedy called McGovern the night of his nomination and confirmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serve as his running mate . McGovern was left if not speechless then totally hapless . So sure that Kennedy could riot possibly refuse him , McGovern had literally not considered another possibility until the call came in from Hyannis-port . His reaction was completely characteristic . " Oh , hell , " he muttered , " I guess ask Gaylord Nelson , Senator from Wisconsin and McGovern 's closest friend in the Senate if he wants it . " It was when Nelson refused ( because he had promised his wife never to seek higher office than the Senate ) that the real scrambling began . Despite the brave face he tried to put on the affair , McGovern never for a moment doubted that the Eagleton revelations had been politically disastrous , perhaps irreparable , and that the overwhelming odds were that Eaglcton would have to go . What kept McGovern hack from dispatching Eagleton then and there was riot so much the hope that somehow they could " bull it through , " as has generally been reported , but a very real concern fur the effect the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may seem , there , in the midst of the worst troubles of his political career , McGovern 's first worry was fur someone else . An inability to deceive True it also is that two years later ( after he had voted for the Gulf of Tonkin resolution 1 , McGovern was lauding President Johnson for his " restraint " and " moderation , " and lashing demonstrators for " serving no useful purpose . " McGovern continued that way for the next two years . alternately criticizing the war and voting for the funds to keep it going . As McGovern 's biographer , I had always been puzzled by his behavior and in my own mind had written it off to the supposition that McGovern. while dubious about the war , had . like so many other doves , given Johnson a period of grace in which to wrap it up . Despite talking to McGovern on the subject at some length , I never fully understood McGovern 's ambivalence , on Vietnam and a lot of other things , until the moment , riding on his plane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the aisle , leaned over to my seat and delivered a quiet lecture on the Vietnam chapter of the book , which Hubert Humphrey had lately been quoting as proof that St. George was riot quite the shining knight he appeared . " You know , " McGovern said , " I was always dead set against that war . There was never a moment when I did n't think it was terrible and immoral . But I had to work on Johnson , and you ca n't do that unless you are credible . You treat Vietnam as if it 's a principle . You have to remember , I am a politician . " Exactly . And therein is the root of McGovern 's ? and all moralists ' ? problem . They can not have it both ways . Vietnam either is a principle . or it is n't . One can not , as McGovern insists h ? can , talk about Vietnam , or for that matter any other issue , in terms of moral Armageddon , whil ( dealing with it in a classically expedient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ credible " ? political style . Not if one expects to be long believed McGovern 's mistake is not in being a months ? but in rationalizing obviously amoral hehavica in moral terms . For when of necessity McGoverr is compelled to say and do the things politicians have to say and do , the contradiction with tho accepted public image of idealistic decency 1 : shattering . What makes it more shattering i : that McGovern , for all his demonstrated skill : as a politician , has never acquired that mos prized political gift : the ability to deceive . Ho seems , in fact , wholly incapable of it . As he say : himself , in utter candor , he is no mystery . Am because he is n't , when his pragmatic self get the better of him , the transformation of Georg McGovern , moralist , to George McGovern , political cian , is completely transparent . One might almost say that what has happenei to George McGovern is what happened to th emperor when the little boy said he wore n clothes . Only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people who cheered him an watched him who created the myth . Georg McGovern never pretended that he did .
