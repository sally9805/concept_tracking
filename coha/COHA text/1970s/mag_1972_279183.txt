IT has become a universal nightmare . Terrorists strike without warning . Innocent persons-a diplomat , a businessman , a planeload of tourists , a team of Olympic athletes-suddenly become hostages , pawns in a parochial struggle that may be blazing half a world away . The " nonnegotiable " demands are issued-for the release of political prisoners , for money , or for passage to another country . Lights go on in the ministries , and the agonizing begins . Is the safety of the hostages to be secured at any cost ? Or must their lives be risked to discourage other terrorists and save future victims ? <P> As the recriminations that followed the Munich massacre suggest , the answers are far from clear . While Israel 's Premier Golda Meir was thanking Bonn for its desperate efforts , other Israelis were vehemently agreeing with the Tel Aviv daily Hatzofeh that the whole tragedy might have been avoided had West Germany not " surrendered " in the past to the demands of terrorists ; last February , Bonn delivered a cool $5,000,000 cash ransom to Palestinian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 186 passengers and crew members and diverted the plane to Aden . For their part , German officials complained that Israel 's refusal to release any Arab prisoners had made the botched rescue a vain effort from the start . <P> Guerrilla groups , bandits and freelance psychopaths in unpredictable varieties have been staging ever more spectacular outrages since 1968 , when some enterprising Palestinians pioneered modern-day political extortion by forcing an El Al jet down in Algeria and negotiating the release of 16 Arabs from Israeli jails in return for the lives of twelve Israeli hostages . During the past five years , Palestinian terrorists , Latin American guerrilleros , Viet Nam War protesters and common criminals in Europe and the Americas have been responsible for roughly 260 skyjackings and political kidnapings . Their bold forays have brought a Dark Ages gloom to travel and diplomacy in much of the 20th century world . What has been learned about how to deal with them ? <P> Forced to confront the problem through heavy overlays of politics , emotion and history , different countries have found different answers . None have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it found itself squeezed between Israeli determination and the weight of its own Nazi past , West Germany has seemed most comfortable with the acquiescent approach . Bonn has not forgotten the 1970 kidnaping of its ambassador to Guatemala , Count Karl von Spreti ; he was summarily executed when a one-month-old Guatemalan government that was determined to strike a tough law-and-order posture refused to release 22 jailed Guatemalan terrorists and to allow Germany to pay a $700,000 ransom .
