Official Washington has a way with words-a god-awful way . This month 's special is " cricon , " a contraction of crisis confrontation . It was apparently coined because apparatchiks and mandarins alike considered the words crisis and confrontation to be badly overused . <P> Among the more practiced perpetrators of mayhem on the English language are members of the U.S. intelligence community . Already they have flattened the phrase communications intelligence ( the fruits of electronic surveillance or code breaking ) into " comint " and reshaped human intelligence ( information from spies ) into " humint . " <P> The White House also does its share . <P> President Carter 's National Security Adviser , Zbigniew Brzezinski , was about to replace the Ford Administration 's NSSMs ( National Security Study Memoranda ) with PSMs ( Presidential Study Memoranda ) - until he realized it might be awkward trying to pronounce that particular acronym . Brzezinski quickly rechristened the reports PRMs ( Presidential Review Memoranda ) , and voila , a new acronym was born-pronounced prims-and certain soon to become among Washington 's best-admired bureaucratic mots. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
