A short story by Gilbert Rogin 1 ( lit rJ J J4 N THE PREFACE to The Tragic Muse , Henry James says that all we see of the artist in triumph " is the back he turns to us as he bends over his work . " But what is our view of him in anything less than that state ? Albert lubricates the male ferrule with sebum from the side of his nose , and puts his spinning rod together . He fits the reel foot into the rod seat , twists the retainer rings and screws them down tight . Then he strips out the seventeen-pound test mono , gently threads it through the guides , and checks the line for frays and nicks . He slips the line through a one-ounce egg sinker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five times , passes it through the loop formed by the first twist , and draws it tight . Next he opens the swivel and slips the snell loop of a wire-snelled 7/0 long-shank bluefish hook into the swivel and snaps it shut . He fixes the hook in an envelope upon which " Compliments of Mr. Al E. Mohny " is written and goes to his bedroom window . Opening the bail , he lowers the rig into the garden three stories below , where Violet , his ex-wife , is sitting with Skippy Mountjoy , her first ex-husband . Paying out the line , Albert reflects on the contingencies awaiting all of us . For example , having recently purchased his first pair of reading glasses , he discovered the other night that he had inadvertently worn them while masturbating . HEN SHE HAS CALMED DOWN , the Human Dynamo , Albert 's twenty-eight-year-old girlfriend , declares that the only conceivable reason Albert told Violet the garden apartment was available was that he had run out of material . She tells this to him on the telephone toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Because the Human Dynamo lives in New Canaan and Albert in New York , they talk on the phone nearly every night , largely about what she had for dinner and whether he needs to bring bread . In the winter , Albert visits the Human Dynamo Wednesdays , because she skis weekends ; in the summer , he visits her Saturdays , because on weekdays she plays tennis after work until it is too dark to see the ball . When he tells her their relationship is absurd , she says , " Why do n't you take up tennis or skiing , so we could have fun together ? " Do you know Donatello 's Dead Christ with Angels ? One of the piteous , attending cherubs has clapped a chubby hand to its cheek  --  nowadays , curiously , a gesture associated with Jewish people , as the Human Dynamo calls us . This is Albert 's attitude when he is told he should take up tennis ( or skiing ) at forty-six . Because the Human Dynamo does n't eat bread , she considers it extravagant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for breakfast on Thursday ( winter ) or Sunday ( summer ) . If she goes to . her parents for dinner , she filches a slice for him ; otherwise , he has to bring one with him on the train , wrapping it in foil and slipping it into his jacket pocket . Like other clandestine acts , carrying a concealed slice of bread is to a degree thrilling and invests the bearer with a sense of mission , self-importance , and romance . Returning to his office from the Y one Wednesday afternoon , Albert reckons he may be the only person walking the streets of New York with a slice of Sprouted Wheat in his pocket . Chances are that at that very moment more bombs are being conveyed in this fashion , and with the terrorist , Albert shares the unendurable need to let someone in on the secret . " Excuse me , sir . Perhaps you 've noticed this slight bulge in my pocket . Pat it for a moment and see if you can guess what I have in here ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eight-track of the Grateful Dead ? " " Uh-uh . " " A very small ant farm ? " When Albert informs the Human Dynamo that as a consequence of reminding him to bring bread or , for example , asking him to solve such moral dilemmas as whether she ha the right to insist that Kurt , a BMW deale and former beau with whom she is dickering for a new car , throw in cocoa mats , his phone bills are averaging more than $100 a month , she says , " I 'm worth it . You give her $500 a month . " A LBERT ALSO GIVES VIOLET his dying quince . Unlike the alimony checks , he does n't lower the branches from his window on fishing line , but carefully carries them downstairs , avoiding the sprinkler system , as though he were participating in a multilevel production of Macbeth , so they wo n't shed petals all over the runner . Violet has told him she ca n't afford fresh flowers because her lawyer let Albert 's lawyer  --  his father , her ex-father-in-law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact that she has to pay taxes on her alimony , so that instead of getting $500 a month , she only gets $283.33 . Whatever , Albert recalls that when he was married to her , the apartment would be full of moribund chrysanthemums and asters standing in dark , faintly fetid water . Albert often wondered why she did n't get rid of them . Was it because of neglect or because of a yearning for the wild , rank , and tangled associated with her rural upbringing ? " Willows , old rotten planks , slimy posts and brickwork ? I love such things . " Constable was another such fancier . Once Albert threw out several boughs that were so ancient they had come to resemble antlers , being covered with a velvetlike growth . When Violet learned what he had done , she burst into tears : the branches were from the magnolia that grew beside the house in which she had been born , and she had broken them off for a memento when it was put up for sale . Their marriage had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her parents . Following Violet 's appearance on the kitchen table , upon which stage her nine older brothers and sisters had previously made their entrances , the midwife , piqued that Violet 's father had been so heedless as to make his wife suffer through ten pregnancies one right after the other , thrust the afterbirth at him , which he flung in the fireplace . Albert has tried to imagine what his father 's reaction would have been if he had been handed Albert 's afterbirth . To make up for putting the magnolia down the incinerator , Albert bought Violet a print if a sprig of small magnolia , or white bay . This now hangs with other floral prints above ier bed . Whenever Albert comes bearing his ) 1d quince  --  or , at other seasons , forsythia , logwood , pendulous , ashen lilacs  --  and putsthe branches in a vase by her fireplace , Scotch-taping them to the mantelpiece so they wo n't tip the vase over , he notices anew that the prints are hanging crooked . This disarray is especially poignant . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pictures straight ; now their obliquity seems to him symbolic of her inability to cope without him and gives rise to tender sentiments , though she might very well be unaware that the prints are dazzlingly crooked , considering rectitude unimportant . This last reflection gives Albert pause . He visualizes himself going critically about his apartment , nudging prints of walruses , flounders , and orioles into line ; making sure the telephone sits squarely on the telephone table , but a little off center to improve the composition ; and arranging the overlapping magazines on the coffee table so that they describe a gentle , jagged arc . In the right angles he recognizes his father 's influence , in the curves his mother 's . During the eleven years of his marriage , Albert tried to instill in his stepchildren this sense of order and fitness , this artistic vision , if you will . He believed he had failed , as he had in inculcating his store of practical and moral precepts , until the other evening when his twenty-three-year-old stepdaughter came to dinner . While waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she wandered about the living room . " Your dictionary is open to P , " she suddenly announced . Although her tone was gloating , Albert had the impulse to take her in his arms . How many times had he told her and her brother to leave the dictionary open to M after looking something up ? It had sunk in ! Solicitously kneading her ice cream with a tablespoon , which keeps getting bent out of shape , so that he has to keep straightening it ( surely a parallel can be drawn with the examined life ) , Albert recalls his father 's explanation , which he had automatically passed on  --  what did he know of physics ? ? that the spine would be ruined if the dictionary was left open to any letter other than M , especially those at the beginning or end of the alphabet . Ruined ! How often his father had invoked that fate , whether in respect to Albert 's posture as a result of slouching about all over the place , or to the chairs he insisted on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents ' reputation as a consequence of fondling his silverware : " If you fondle it here where Mother and I can overlook it or forgive you because you 're our son , you 'll fondle it when you 're dining out where it will reflect falsely on your rearing . " Albert goes over to the dictionary and clutches it with both hands , his left thumb on the page headed Mainstay- , his right on the one headed Make , the fingers of his left hand on Collegium. , those of his right on Tortive , as UT I LEFT ALBERT fishing from the window . Surely no angler will have better luck . It is gusty. darkening , ear-ly spring . The air through which the white envelope  --  addressor , Mr. Al E. Mohny ? flutters down is palest lavender , the color , Albert recalls from his life with Violet , that cornflowers turn if they 're not thrown out . She and Skippy are seated at a glass-topped table , in which overarching California privet is re-flected. the images of the tossing branches more tempestuous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like a stormy sea funneled against rocks , or be-cause an image is in a sense art , which height-ens . Drinking iced tea , Violet and Skippy are unaware of the descending envelope , now hov-ering ominously a few feet above their heads . As Skippy begins laughing  --  immoderate laughter that from time to time awakens Albert in the middle of the night  --  the telephone rings . Albert turns the reel handle to snap the hail shut , lays the rod on the floor , and answers the phone . It 's the Human Dynamo , who left the courts early on account of the wind . " Should I name my car Yogurt ? " she says . She explains that she is going to register her new BMW in Vermont so she wo n't have to pay the local property tax , and is thinking of getting vanity plates . " It ca n't be more than six characters . " " Have you considered anything else ? " " Sundae , Banana , Raisin , Gopher , Muffin . " " Does it have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Squeak , Oh Wow , Breezy . What do you think , Albie ? " " I think we ought to get a WATS line . " " No , really . " " I really think you should call it Virtue , after your age . " " Huh ? " " The ancients regarded twenty-eight as the perfect number because it equals the sum of all its divisors and therefore signifies virtue . I think a good many motorists would find it uplifting . " " Do you think you 're too old for me ? " " I think I 'm too old for myself , " Albert says , imagining driving along the South Dixie Highway in the prolonged summer twilight , his plates emblazoned MISERY or CRISIS or SORROW . After he 's hung up , Albert returns to the window and begins reeling in . By then it is dark , the wind has died ; Violet and Skippy are either sitting quietly under the privet or have gone inside . Albert has the impression that while be was on the phone , line had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abyss . What had he expected to catch ? To what use could he put a fragment of the past ? Aubrey wrote of seeing a mower using an arm off the monument of a lord in a ruined abbey nearby to whet his scythe . " While preparing my income tax , " Albert 's father , who is eighty , says , " I was made aware of a haunting fragrance . " " I think ' haunting ' is too theatrical for daisies , " Albert 's mother says , biting into a brownie . " Jasmine . Frangipani ? " " I think ' was made ' is too literary , particularly for the Upper West Side , " Albert says . " What 's wrong with ' became ' ? I became aware ? " " I have become aware that I am surrounded by petits stinquers , " his father says , frenchifying , his habit in a tight spot . Albert is having dinner at his parents , which he does every Friday . " At any rate , " his father goes on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I looked up , puzzled . It was ? " He in ? dicates the daisies , which , with an arrangement of gourds , make up the centerpiece . " It way evocative . " Albert waits for him to say of what , but his father 's lips are compressed . He turns to his mother to see if there is a secret and she share : it . She , too , is looking at him expectantly . Al Bert detects that she is on the verge of smiling , but is unsure whether it would be appropriate . In the moments in which his father is apparently dwelling on the evocation the scent of daisies gave rise to and his mother is evidently trying to again come to terms with the fact that the man to whom she has been married for more than fifty years has memories of idyllic interludes from which she is forever excluded , Albert recalls reeling in his line until the bare hook appeared above the sill . " Jake 's coming back , " he announces to change the subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Josh 's litter brother , " Albert says . " They 're those dogs , " his father says to his mother . Shortly after they were married , Albert and Violet had bought two dachshund puppies , Josh and Jake . When they were four , Jake inexplicably began attacking Josh . Albert and Violet decided they would have to separate them , and advertised to find a new home for Jake . The ad was answered by a childless couple named White . Albert took Jake in a taxi to their apartment in the West Eighties , in which rows of nearly identical cacti were set out beneath indistinct landscapes featuring morose cows . Albert showed Mr. White , a short man with a frequent , perhaps facetious laugh , how to clean Jake 's ears ; he had n't seen him since . Josh now lived with Violet . In the morning , when Albert went for the Times , he took Josh along , forgotten down by his ankles ; when he delivered his withering bouquets , he would dandle him on his knees , like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preposterous in this context , scarred by Jake 's teeth : part dog , part child , part god . " I began to have pangs , " Albert tells his parents . " I felt I had cast Jake out of my life , disposed of him . I wanted to see him again before he died . I called the Whites up . Dialing , l had a premonition I would be too late . Mrs. White answered . ' How 's that ' ittle doggie doin ' after all these years ? ' I said . ' He 's fine , ' she said . ' He was a great comfort to Mr. White at the end . ' It turned out the ' ittle hubbie had died three years ago . I did n't know what to say . I was entranced by the irony . The upshot is she 's going to Corfu for ten days and would be delighted to have Jake visit me while she 's away . " " For the life of me , I do n't know why you go out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says . " You persist in dwelling in the past , " his father says . " Installing Violet right under your feet , " his mother says . " How are you ever to go for-ward ? " " I seem to be swept along , " Albert says . " I 'm going to be in Who 's FP ho . " " la the East ? " his father says . " I 'm in the East . Who 's Who in the East . I 've been in there for ages . " " In America , " Albert says , feeling it may be an uncharitable remark . " I 'm in the morgue , " his father says . " I 'm in the morgue , too , " his mother says . Albert envisages the two slim manila envelopes of brittle , yellowing clippings nestled side by side in a filing cabinet , closer than their subjects are in life . " I 'm clearing the decks , " Albert 's father says abruptly , rising , as though realizing that in weighing his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there is no time to lose if he wants to swell his envelope . He begins scooping up plates . " I 'll do it , " Albert 's mother says , also rising . They face each other warily across the littered table like wrestlers before a match . " I 'm restoring some order , " his father says . " You 're terrible , " his mother says . " You 're the second person who 's called me that today . " " Who was the first ? " she says . " Albert 's Violet . " " I never ? " " I was riding the down escalator at the bank , when I noticed her rising toward me on the up escalator . I greeted her . ' You 're a terrible man , ' she said . " " I never ? " " I wanted to ask her what she meant , but we were rapidly drawing apart . When I reached the bottom I got on the up escalator . When I reached the top she had vanished . Albert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " The tax on the alimony , probably . " " But she was represented . " " I never ? " " Please sit down , " Albert says . " I 'm going to clear the table . " " Do you think I 'm terrible ? " his father asks , slowly lowering himself , reaching behind with one hand , as though uncertain whether his chair might have been whisked away , that his life might have turned out to he some sort of practical joke . " Violet tends to divide people into friendlies and hostiles , " Albert says . " I believe it has to do with coming from a large family where you had to fight for a hind teat . " Once again he imagines his father , a young man not unlike himself at thirty-three. but appalled , not knowing what to do with Albert 's afterbirth . " It 's not your father 's fault that she did n't have better representation , " Albert 's mother says . Albert collects the teacups and heads for the kitchen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father sings out . " There are one or two squeezes left . " " Why do n't you take more dishes with you ? " his mother calls after him . " Then you wo n't have to make so many trips . " Pushing open the swinging door , Albert thinks : But I want to keep going back and forth ; that way I can postpone whatever is going to happen next : e.g. , that the last of the argyle socks Violet bought him during the course of their marriage would get a hole in it and he would have to throw it out . Albert thinks of himself as a balloon , whose mooring lines are being cast off one by one , so that one day he will unexpectedly , fearfully , stately rise . ETURNINC from his parents , Albert runs into Skippy Mountjoy walking Josh . " What was the blue-plate special tonight ? " Skippy asks , falling in alongside him . " Roast capon or brisket ? " " Know my every move , do n't you , Skippy ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ver-ry deep . Ver-ry ' ittle gets by ' ittle Josh . Fridays Mom and Dad , Saturdays Human Dynamo , except in the winter when it 's Wednesdays and the Knicks are Saturdays , as well as Tuesdays , when they 're at home . Josh tells me Jake 's coming for a visit . Think they 'll mix it up ? " " No . Jake was always the aggressor . I 'm convinced it had to do with territory . Josh never had a sense of territory . Besides , the territory no longer exists . " " Care to draw any parallels vis- ? - vis you , me , and Violet ? " " Only if you do , Skippy . " " Oh , no , I pass . Never touch the stuff . More in your line  --  analogizing , metaphorizing . No izing on my cake . Right , Josh ? Dog 's got unimagined depths . You , you 've got imagined depths . Right , Albie ? Surface another story . " They pass beneath the sycamores that border the sidewalk at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Albert has the impression the shadows are duckweed and that they are walking on water . " What do you mean ? " " You 're in a rut . " " I 'm not in a rut , Skippy . I lead a contrived life . " " V-8 , tschav , three-quarters of a pound of ground round , Sprouted Wheat , and applesauce every night is a poor contrivance , then . Allow me to give you my recipe for red wine court bouillon . " They have reached the gate to the three steps leading to Violet 's apartment . Skippy unlatches it and Josh bounds down . Albert turns to climb the stoop . Taking out his keys , he tells Skippy , " Send it up on the line sometime . " As he approaches his landing , Albert hears his telephone ringing . He pounds up the remaining stairs , unlocks the door , and runs for the phone . " It 's me . " It 's the Human Dynamo . " Yes , what is it ? " Albert says , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bird pooped on my new car . " When he gets into bed , he puts on his glasses , but does n't read . Instead , he wonders whether by nature the contrived life precludes what were once called " the good parts " ; e.g. , " This book has a lot of good parts " or " Did you get to the good parts yet ? " If he puts a quarter in a Times Square peep show , invariably an innocuous segment of the loop appears ; a blonde and a brunette in a convertible driving along a palm-lined street , making little moues as they try to find the house where the mixed foursome will take place . Albert is almost convinced that no matter how many quarters he spends , he will never get to see the good parts , that in episode after episode the girls will continue to circle through the streets , becoming more and more fretful  --  the acting here godawful  --  at their inability to find the right address , that it will gradually become dark , the lights come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lustrously beneath the palms .... Albert takes off his glasses and folds the earpieces . They make two little clicks when they strike the frames . Albert is charmed by the sound . What a satisfactory way to denote the conclusion of yet another day , like the del. onation of a remote sunset gun . To think that until recently his days ended unceremonious ly . In a sense , these minute , faintly melanchol ) salutes constitute good parts , too , he supposes Several hours later , Albert 's bedroom opens The light from the landing discloses a hull boy of two or so . He is wearing a brown vel veteen suit . A spray of quince and leatherlea fern is pinned to his lapel . Ile makes a hierati sign . " Behold , " he says , " I show you a my : tery . " As he totters toward the bed , Alber sees that his eyes are red , glowing , like a dog ' in a flash photograph . ? Iakie ! " Extending his arms , Albert recalls walkin him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground , gave him a sense of plat and intention . 60 The next morning , Albert is awakened by the phone . " It 's me . " It 's Violet . " Yes , what is it ? " " Oh , Albert , a squirrel 's eating my baby 's breath . " T HAS BEEN SAID that the greatest single / discovery in the history of thought is the invention of a symbol for nought , " Albert says . He is sitting at Violet 's desk , writing out her alimony check . " It would make a nice couplet , if I worked at it . " " We would 've made a nice couple if you had worked at it , " Violet says , Scotch-taping to her mantelpiece the quince he brought downstairs . She steps back to examine her handiwork . As if on cue , a few pink petals flutter pathetically to the hearth . " And if it 's such a great invention , why do n't you add another to the check ? " " I hear you passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , " Albert says , taking off his shoes and climbing up on Violet 's bed . " Because he is . " Albert straightens the floral prints above her pillows , then begins jumping up and down on the bed . " Violet , do I look like a high-bouncing ex-lover ? " " You look like someone who has shafted me . " " I 'll set up an appointment for you with my accountant . Maybe he can scheme up some deductions . " " Timmmberar ! " Violet cries . On the way up , Albert sees the Scotch tape ripping loose , the quince going over . He springs off the bed , catching the branches before they bring the vase down . The last of the blossoms litter the hearth . " ' In a drear-nighted December ' , " Albert quotes , picking them up , " ' Too happy , happy tree/ Thy branches ne'er remember/ Their green felicity . ' I have to go . " " It 's Saturday , is n't it ? " " I 'm catching the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're here , I think of you up there . It 's like you 're sitting on my head . When you 're away , I have no top . " " But it 's Saturday . " He backs toward the door , the blossoms filling his cupped palms , not knowing where to put them . " Albert , " Violet says , holding out her hands , " why do n't you take up howling so we could have fun together ? " He gently tips the petals into her hands . Albert hears the telephone ringing as he climbs the stairs . " It 's me . " It 's the Human Dynamo . She 's sobbing . " What 's wrong ? " " The form came from the Vermont Motor Vehicle Bureau , " " And ? " " And Albie , it says you 're only allowed to have five characters . " " And ? " " And all I can think of is Peach . I had such good names for my car . " " We 'll discuss it at dinner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " On the 5:05 he reenvisages the South Dixie Highway at twilight . This time his plates bear ENNUI , GMT . A few miles beyond Port Chester , the train comes to a halt . Five or ten minutes pass and there is still no announcement about pantographs or stalled trains ahead . Then the doors slide open . Several passengers , Albert among them , jump to the ground and walk forward along the roadbed . It is a mild , clear evening . The engineer and the conductors are standing in front of the head car , gazing down . Joining them , Albert sees they are at the rim of a vast abyss . Its interior is largely in shadow , the very depths filled with a bluish haze out of which protrude vividly colored eminences of sandstone and shale suggesting minarets , turrets , steeples , spires . Albert pictures the Human Dynamo waiting forlornly at the station in her new BMW . If he can descend into the abyss and then scale the other side he can get a cab at Greenwich . He lowers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After he has gone a way , he looks back . He can no longer see the rim . Raising his eyes , as though contemplating a Tiepolo ceiling , he descries not whirling , apo ? theosizing figures but a cloudless sky being drained of light . He continues down ; on the more level stretches the little evening primrose displays its pink blossoms . My life has been one long interruption , he muses , between what I intended to do and what I never got arounc to doing . While composing " Intimations , ' Wordsworth was interrupted by the arrival o Mr. 011iff 's load of dung , and went to work it the garden . But he finished it . Slipping and sliding on the scree in hi suede loafers , Albert loses his footing an ( fetches up against a hoodoo . Brushing himsel off , he discovers he is carrying something his jacket pocket . What does he have in there A pack of cigars ? A bundle of love letters A well-folded Speedo swimsuit ? He fishes ou the object and unwraps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bread . 62
