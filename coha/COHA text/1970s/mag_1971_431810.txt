109 Golda Meir : Israel 's Tough GrandmotherPrime : Minister Born in Russia , reared in America , this indestructible woman now heads the nation whose survival is a bone of contention between the two superpowers S HE IS an old woman , past the Biblical threescore and ten . The archetypal Jewish mother , she fusses over her two grown children , dotes on her five grandchildren , cooks gefilte fish and chicken soup . But Golda Meir is also Prime Minister of Israel ? and one of the ablest and toughest leaders on thecontemporary scene . Golda ( no one in Israel ever refers to her as Mrs. Meir ) holds down one of the world 's most difficult jobs . Although Israel 's 2.5 million Jews have known nothing but w.u , or the threat of it , since the state was . founded in 1948 , a new and highly dangerous element has been added : the Soviet Union has been staging a massive military buildup in Egypt .

If Israel needs a flinty leader in this time of crisis , it has one in this 73-year-old matriarch . Arabs and other critics accuse Golda of being inflexibly stubborn . Her admirers prefer to say that she is " strongwilled . " When the then Prime Minister , David Ben-Gurion , named her Foreign Minister in 1956 , he proudly proclaimed that she was the " only man " in his cabinet . Today , Golda enjoys fantastic support from the Israeli public . Israel is a cockpit of political squabbling ? there are 13 parties in its 12o-member Knesset , or Parliament ? yet polls consistently show that 75 percent of the public approves of her policies . One reason for her prestige is that few Israelis can remember a time when Golda was not on the scene ; she has been active in public life for more than 40 years .

As Prime Minister , Golda presides over meetings of her all-male cabinet much in the manner of a schoolmarm with a classroom of unruly pupils . When ministers talk among themselves , Golda testily raps for order . Onc she told a cabinet member to p down a newspaper . " This is not reading room ! " she snapped . Yet she can be soft as butter . Whe she was Foreign Minister , a woma who had lost her sons in the 195 war requested an appointmen Golda 's secretary told the woma that she could stay only ten minutes but , once in Golda 's office , the di traught woman produced a Bible and began reading whole chapte aloud .

She has at various times suffered from kidney stones , gallbladder attacks , pneumonia , migraine head.aches , phlebitis and total exhaustion . To the horror of family and friends , she smokes 6o to 8o cigarettes a day . She wears orthopedic shoes as a result of a broken leg suffered in a taxi accident in Brooklyn nearly 25 years ago . Asked about her health , she once replied , " Nothing serious . A touch of cancer here , a little tuberculosis there . " Promised Land . Golda was born on May 3 , 1898 , in Kiev , capital of the Ukraine , in Czarist Russia . Although her father , Moshe Mabovitch , was a skilled cabinetmaker , the family lived in constant want . Also , they were under intense religious persecution , and ugly incidents were frequent in her early cars . She remembers a man corning up to her and another little girl , knocking their heads together , and saying , " That 's what we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heads and be through with them . " All over Russia , Jews who could scrape together the fare were leaving for America . In 1903 , Moshe Mabovitch sailed for New York , leaving behind his wife and three daughters ? Shana , the eldest , who now lives in Israel ; Golda , the middle child ; and Zipporah , who now lives in Bridgeport , Conn . When Golda was eight , Moshe sent for his family ; he had found a job as a railroad worker in Milwaukee . To the Mabovitches , America was a Promised Land of freedom and education . Golda was enrolled in the first grade of the Fourth Street School and , although she had known only Yiddish until then , quickly learned English and in two years was at the head of her class . Life , however , was not easy . To make ends meet , Golda 's mother opened a little grocery store , with the family living in two rooms in back . If people are amazed today at Golda 's capacity for hard work , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her life . She had to open the store early in the morning and remain until her mother returned with the day 's purchases from the wholesale market . After school , she was back behind the counter . " I was never , " Golda recalls , " given an opportunity to be spoiled by leisure . " After attending teachers college and doing a brief stint teaching in a Yiddish school in Milwaukee , Golda resolved to emigrate to Palestine and there help build a Jewish homeland . Her determination intensified after she heard an inspiring speech by the young David Ben-Gurion , who was then visiting Milwaukee . But World War I was in progress , and Golda had to wait . In the meantime , she married , at 19 , Morris Meyerson , a young Russian-Jewish immigrant who eked out a precar- ious existence as a sign painter . Morris was opposed to moving to Palestine , but Golda prevailed , and the couple finally set sail from New York in 1921 . To this day , Golda has warm memories of America . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not fleeing from oppression and insecurity . I was leaving to participate in the setting up of independence and security for my own people . " To Build a Nation . The Meyersons eventually settled in a shabby flat in Jerusalem . There a son , Menachem , who is now a cellist , and a daughter , Sarah , who lives on a kibbutz with her husband , were born . Morris worked for a pittance as a bookkeeper , while Golda took in laundry to pay Menachem 's tuition at nursery school . Golda chafed under this routine , and in 1928 she accepted a full-time job as secretary of the Women 's Labor Council . Soon she became one of the top leaders of the Histadrut , a labor federation which also functioned as a colonizing agency , training and settling Jewish immigrants who were pouring into Palestine in growing numbers . But her private life suffered , and eventually Golda and Morris were separated . He died in Israel in 1951 . In 1947 , the United Nations voted to partition Palestine into a Jewish and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for war , and Golda was sent to the United States to raise money from American Jews for buying weapons . Jewish leaders in Palestine estimated that she could , at best , raise $7 million in America . But Golda barnstormed across the United States for 21/2 months , addressing two and three meetings a day , until she had raised an astonishing $50 million . On her return to Palestine , Ben-Gurio said , " Someday it will be said that one Jewish woman got the money which made the state possible . " The state of Israel was proclaimed on May 14 , 1948 , and Golda , cryin with joy , was one of 37 signers o its Declaration of Independence . Exodus . That same year , Ben Gurion , who was head of Israel ' Provisional government and late became the first Prime Minister , sen Golda to the Soviet Union as Israel ' first diplomatic envoy .

Since then , th number of immigrants has risen to more than 1.25 million and , as Golda is fond of pointing out , no family is homeless , no child unschooled . On the eve of the 1956 war with ISRAEL 'S TOUGH GRANDMOTHER-PRIME MINISTER 113  | Egypt Ben-Gurion named Golda Forreign Minister . ( Also , at BenGurion request , she Hebraized her name from Meyerson to Meir . ) Ilolda stayed in that post until 1965 when , at the age of 67 , she stepped down , saying that she needed a rest .

With considerable deft'less , she strengthened the party by bringing two warring factions back into the fold . Finally , at the age of 76 , she retired from the party job and returned to her flat in a suburb t 1 Tel Aviv , saying , " Now I 'll be able to read a few good books . " That might have been the end of long and eventful career if it had pot been for the death of Prime Minister Levi Eshkol in early 1969. party chieftains , fearful that the party would be split by a power struggle between Defense Minister Moshe Dayan and Deputy Prime Minister Yigal Allon , concluded that there was only one person acceptable to all factions as well as to the public . So , Golda was summoned from retirement to become interim Prime Minister . The following October , the was elected to a full four-year term . To those who whispered that she was too old , Golda snapped " Being 7o is not a sin .

Later in the year , Golda made her first official visit to America as Prime Minister of Israel . It led , the following year , to deliveries of Phantom jet fighter-bombers and other military equipment to Israel , as well as U.S. Congressional approval of $500 million in credits for arms purchases . The big question for Golda , as for all Israelis , is where Israel will go from here . The country is enjoying an economic boom and full employment . But the long-term outlook is less assuring . Although , on American urging , both Israel and Egypt agreed to a cease-fire in August 1970 , diplomats caution that it will probably be a long time before any permanent settlement to the Middle East crisis can be worked out . Israel , though , was born in war , and an entire generation has known little else . Like her people , Golda is determined to ride out the storm , come what may .
