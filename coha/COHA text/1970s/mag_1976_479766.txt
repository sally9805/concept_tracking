wORDS , AFTER ALL , define us , " writes Gore Vidal . The reader 's mind then staggers about as it is exposed to Vidal 's dazzling sentences . How do you envision this person whose words turn each page into a tray of jewelry ? As a bullfighter , perhaps . Arrogant body drawn like a bow , eyes disdainful . The clumsy stupid bull so easy to handle that the great danger is boredom . Or maybe he should be seen , Gore Vidal , as a prizefighter born with hands that think . Left hook . The other mail covers and moves away from the left hook . Another left hook . Moving away again . A third left hook . More moving away . Moving away from the left hook and directly into the fine right hand , which was the idea from the beginning . Head moving into the right hand , right hand moving into the head . And Vidal walks to the corner without as much as a glance back . The referee counts the fight to an end , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holds aloft a comb . But the comb is not needed ? the fighter has not even broken sweat . However , more sensible thoughts arise as the reading goes on . Writers most certainly are not heroic figures . They drink much less than insurance 106 salesmen , they are poor lovers , and they can not fight . I once saw two great he-man writers have a tremendous go at each other ? eyes closed , hands flailing like Wellesley undergraduates . Ernest Hemingway ? My dear old friend from Broadway , M. Harry ( Champ ) Segal , assures us . " He was the world 's greatest writer , but he did n't even know how to make a fist . " How , then , do the words of 1876 define the writer ? Examine first the words : Whenever I see trees falling before the wind , hear thunder , observe the sea furious , I think of the December day and the paleness of the mother 's face in vivid contrast to the redness of her blood , that endless hemorrhaging of blood . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine horses , snorting steam like so many railway engines : in the modern industrial age the writer must use only mechanical references to define old-fashioned fleshly things . Of the three Delmonico restaurants , the one at Fourteenth Street and Union Square is eel- ? tainly the most fashionable . The carpeting is thick . The lamps are richly shaded . How important it is to see the food plainly , yet not to see or to be seen too closely by those one dines with ! Damask curtains comfortably contained the warmth but not the heat that one gets so of ten in overcrowded , poorly ventilated eating places . All of which leaves you with the notion of Vidal as a man sitting in Italy for six months while this magnificent gift with which he was born pours out the words in arrangements which please the mind , please the ear , please the palate . Somewhere . somebody may be able to write sentences as well as Vidal , but I wonder who there is who can write as easily . Vidal 's is a smashing gift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than is usually associated with the trade . Which is a very good thing . A common laborer he is not . This 1876 is a glorious piece of writing , and it should and will he bought and read and kept and reread by anybody with a taste for words . But do not come to this book looking for a new , interesting character : Vidal is too busy concentrating on words to provide us with that . In 1876 he has Charles Schermerhorn Schuyler , foreign correspondent , returning to New York with his daughter Emma , thirty-five , born and raised in Paris and now the widow of the Prince d'Agrigente and hungry for a man who can sustain her habit of being rich . Schuyler wants to hook up with a successful Democratic candidate in the election of 1876 and come away with an ambassadorship to France . Or at least that 's what I think Schuyler desires . He is not close to a strong character , and I have trouble remembering much about him . Vidal uses Schuyler as the narrator of this book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his words always do . As for daughter Emma , her I can not even see . Murky murk . This ends Vidal 's notions of character creation . Past these two , the people in his book ? Samuel J. Tilden , William Cullen Bryant . James G. Blaine , U. S. Grant ? are familiar to anybody who has attended high school . So many of these characters displease Vidal -- only Grant . and Tilden , whom Vidal elevates to the priesthood , dissolve his scorn ? that the effect is nearly wearying . And I know Vidal deliberately twists characters to make the had into the good . ' Therefore , I trust none of these judgments . But again , what does it matter ? The sentence is supreme . This month 's instructions : The diagram would form a regular twelve-sided solid if folded along the dotted lines . The clues in group A lead to words of six letters ; each of these words contains all the ( mixed ) letters of a five-letter word plus one extra letter . The five-letter words are clued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the centers of the appropriate pentagons with the associated five-letter words inscribed around them ( to read in the direction shown by the arrows ) in such a way that , at each edge of the solid . adjacent fetters are the same When the diagram is complete , the central letters from 1 to 12 will spell the name of the person ( a royal pretender ? ) to whom the puzzle is dedicated . N.B. : the clues are in no particular order ; the answer to clue ( a ) in group A is not necessarily associated with the answer to clue ( a ) in group B The solver must figure out which six-letter answers are " associated " with which five-letter answers , and where to place them . Example : The answer to a clue in group A might be WARDEN : the answer to a clue in Group B might be DRAWN . Since WARDEN contains the letters in DRAWN , these two words would be " associated " and DRAWN would be entered ( in the direction of the arrows ) in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a way that the D , the R , the A , the W , and the N would each be duplicated in another word on the adjacent side of an edge . Answers include one proper name and two foreign words ( one common , one well-known to gourmets . ) Three answers are uncommon words , but none is obscure . One letter , with its duplication , has been printed to help you get started . As always , mental repunctuation of a clue is the key to its solution further down the long American social ladder . " Following an inspection of how the rich lived in New York a hundred years ago , Vidal takes up the last half of the hook with a well-paced description of how Rutherford 13 . Hayes . Republican , stole the election of 1876 from Samuel J. Tilden , Democrat . Vidal does such a job of selling me Tilden that I am holding my breath , rooting for him to make it while the New York Times attacks him , and a coalition of Army troops , rail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the election from him . Tilden won the popular vote by a then solid 250,000 . He lost the Presidency in Washington by a single electoral vote ? lost it , Vidal says , because a civil war again threatened and Tilden did not want to be the one who fired the first shot . " If Governor Tilden has a fatal flaw , " Schuyler observes , " it is his curious notion that men can be compelled by good argument to be honest , to show disinterest where there is only interest and greed . " Now I do n't know if Tilden was this good at all . Vidal is cheating like a bitch when he steals from a history textbook to get a plot for his novel , so why should n't he freak around the facts too ? So what ? He is a writer of such supreme ability that he can do whatever he wants . He need not grope , agonize , writhe , moan , caterwaul as do those who write only half as well or less . He does as he pleases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the first half of 1876 , and it can be compelling reading . And then he can take history , as he does in the second half of the book , and make it powerful and astonishing . In the first part of 1876 , Gore Vidal is in places and with people I really do n't want to care about , but the book was impossible to put down . In the second part , he went off into a hundred-year-old election , and my interest is in this year 's . I still found myself trying to turn a page before finishing it . His approach always is haughty and bloodless , and I like more pulse in words . But for the last time , what does it matter ? ? jimmy Breslin is the author of two novels ? The Gang That Could n't Shoot Straight ( Bantam ) and World Without End , Amen ( Viking ) ? and How the Good Guys Finally Won : Notes from art Impeachment Summer ( Viking ) . He is now at work on a third novel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
