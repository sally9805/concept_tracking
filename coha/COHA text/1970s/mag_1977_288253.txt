JULIA . Directed by Fred Zinnemann . Screenplay by Alvin Sargent <P> On paper , Julia sounds like an exemplary American film . In sharp contrast to most current big-budget movies , it trades in serious ideas rather than comic-book fantasies , and it even has the guts to buck Hollywood 's longstanding embargo on heroines by starring two strong , intelligent women who care about other things than men . Since they are played by Jane Fonda and Vanessa Redgrave , it 's hard to imagine how Julia could fail - but fail , to a sad extent , it does . For all the taste , talent and money that have been lavished on this film , it is stubbornly lacking in passion and life . <P> Julia 's problems trace back to its source , a Lillian Hellman story that appeared in her 1973 memoir , Pentimento . <P> Whatever its virtues , this elliptical tale is risky movie material : a brief meditation on the author 's 20-year relationship with a wealthy childhood friend who ultimately died fighting European fascism , Julia is short on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the film 's creators have not addressed themselves to the cinematic challenges that Julia raises . Instead , they misguidedly reproduce Hellman 's convoluted narrative , all the while padding the story with superfluous scenes that add literal-minded psychological footnotes to the action . The movie that emerges is a glossy bio flick that superficially charts the rise of Lillian Hellman , Young Leftist Playwright . <P> The film works up some steam only when it is recounting the central anecdote of the original story , a scary 1937 train ride in which Hellman ( Fonda ) smuggles $50,000 to Julia ( Redgrave ) and her antifascist comrades in Berlin . Director Zinnemann ( High Noon ) brings a Graham Greenesque sense of intrigue to this adventure , and he sets up a powerful climactic scene . When Hellman finally arrives in a smoky Berlin cafe to deliver the loot , her terse , hurried conversation with Julia sums up everything the film has been trying to say about friendship , political commitment and growing up . Simultaneously the two star performances crystallize . Fonda 's Hellman , who has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ becomes a figure of some substance and courage . Redgrave 's Julia-who is generally shortchanged by the film-metamorphoses into a complete revolutionary ; her calm voice and flaming eyes convey both the serenity and passion of the true believer . <P> The rest of the time , Julia is mired in its maker 's mistakes of aesthetic judgment . The many flashbacks to the heroines ' girlhood days have more to do with the conventions of old-fashioned movies than with the characters ' relationship . <P> The bland scenes that dwell on Hellman 's love affair with Writer Dashiell Hammett ( Jason Robards ) are as cryptic as they are irrelevant . Meanwhile , other poorly delineated supporting characters prance around without apparent purpose . <P> Perhaps to give Julia the aura of art , Zinnemann has dotted the film with pretty recurring images , and they are superbly rendered by Cinematographer Douglas Slocombe . But this is artiness , not art . <P> Though Julia is all dressed up to be a great movie , it never figures out how to get where it wants to go . - Frank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
