Shades of La Dolce Vita-4 a.m. in Rome and Amazonian Anita Ekberg in full cry . Six carabinieri were needed at the Cavalieri Residence to quell the disturbance . It seems that Anita , after waltzing home all aglow with vita and vino , had yanked the covers off her sleeping spouse , Sometime Actor Rile.von Nutter . " I did n't want to hit her in the face , " Rik explained . " I just turned her over my knee and gave her the reddest butt you ever saw . And that 's not a tiny bottom . " <P> ... <P> The perils of space travel and walking on the moon are one thing , but federal bureaucracy is something else . Astronaut Neil Armstrong , who will take over a NASA desk in Washington as a coordinator of aeronautical research between Uncle Sam and industry , was asked whether he had sold his house in Houston . " Maybe I 'd just better keep it , " he grinned , " in case I need a hiding place from the Washington people . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the block , but few of Hollywood 's own won out in the bidding . At the auction of 46 years ' and a rumored $1,600,000 worth of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer props and costumes , Debbie Reynolds tried to buy her own brass bed from The Unsinkable Molly Brown , but just did n't want to go as high as $3,000 . The day belonged to unknown buyers , who put up $2,400 for Bert Lahr 's cowardly-lion suit from The Wiz ard of Oz and $1,250 for Clark Gable 's battered trenchcoat .

As the bidding spiraled around him , Actor Jack Cassidy said , " I 'll be lucky to get a spear from Ben-Hur . " As it turned out , he did n't even get that . <P> ... <P> His last picture , Anne of the Thousand Days , was virtually stolen by young Genevieve Bujold as Anne Boleyn . This time out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Here 's Lucy TV series , and as he told the story , it was " terrible to work with two big stars " like Lucille Ball and his wife Elizabeth Tayor . " Give me back the unknowns , " he groaned . Still it is hard to believe that Burton could be totally upstaged while playing-as he does on Lucy 's show-a Shakespeare-spouting plumber . <P> ... <P> To students at Los Angeles ' Loyola University , the imitation of W. C. Fields in My Little Chickadee seemed uncannily exact . And why not ? The imitator was W.C. 's grandson Ronald , 20 , who was using the act to propel his campaign for student-body president . He even paraphrased parts of his grandfather 's 1940 book , Fields for President . Sample : " Many of you have asked why I am running for President when I already have a promising future as a veterinarian . " Unlike Grandpa , he won . <P> ...
