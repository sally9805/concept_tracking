" We took most of the lead out , to help clean up the air , " boasts an ad for Esso Big Plus gasoline . Another ad reads : " A new gasoline-non-leaded Shell of the Future . Part of Shell 's drive for cleaner air . " A third is headlined : " How do you pick the right gasoline to help fight pollution ? Choose lead-free Amoco Super-Premium . " <P> Spurred by mounting public alarm over smog-choked cities and a generally threatened ecology , the gasoline producers are dashing to establish their credentials as nature 's protectors . They are not alone . Environmental control has become one of the hottest themes on Madison Avenue , and it now appears in ads for firms as disparate as Westinghouse , International Paper and Procter &; Gamble . What is the reason ? " It is partly conscience and partly good business , " says Adman James Durfee , president of Carl Ally , Inc . Adds Kenyon &; Eckhardt 's Sam Spilo : " It is fear . Businessmen see their corporations threatened for fouling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about it . " <P> Arm &; Hammer Blows . To call attention to its antipollution efforts , Armco Steel ran an ad showing its Ashland , Ky. , plant under sootless blue skies . The headline : " Imagine a steel company giving up smoking . Imagine Armco . " Potlatch Forests , Inc. , a lumber company , has ads with scenes of forests and wildlife . One shows a sparkling , pine-flanked waterway over the headline : " It cost us a bundle , but the Clearwater River still runs clear . " The message : Potlatch installed a filter plant to remove wood and bark deposited in the river by its Idaho logging operations . <P> Charges that phosphates in detergents ultimately kill wildlife in streams and lakes have opened new opportunities for Arm &; Hammer washing soda . Ads note that it is phosphate-free and , when added to ordinary soaps like Lux or Ivory , can transform them into heavy-duty cleaners . In the interests of " helping save our nation 's waters , " the ad lists nine detergents with high phosphate contents and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &; Hammer and soaps . <P> The environment theme can have competitive disadvantages . Coca-Cola is running a series of messages urging customers to use returnable bottles and thus reduce litter . But Pepsi-Cola came out with an ad showing its own nonreturnable bottles . The punch line : " You 'll never get a second-hand bottle from us . " <P> Some executives assert that the public is not interested in paying for products that reduce pollution . General Motors , for example , has just spent $50,000 to promote and test-market in Phoenix a $20 exhaust-emission control kit for pre-1968 models . Out of 334,000 owners of such cars in the area , only 528 bought the kit . ( Chrysler , on the other hand , reports brisk sales of a similar kit for its cars. )
