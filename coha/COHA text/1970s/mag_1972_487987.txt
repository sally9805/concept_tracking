" Sometimes you feel ' like a three-pound hen trying to lay a four-pound egg . " ? Spiro Agnew , March 15 , 1969 Washington A couple of years ago the United States Information Agency issued a propaganda film intended to show the romance and heroism of Vice President Spiro Agnew . USIA films can be distributed only in foreign lands , which is a pity , for this film had a profound message , and the place to deliver it was here at home . Since most readers can not see the film ( only newsmen and politicians are permitted domestic screenings of USIA films ) , I offer a summary . And please remember as I do so , that USIA film makers , an extremely talented group of fellows when it comes to making silk purses out of sows ' ears , had worked more than a year and had spent an estimated $50,000 in an attempt to put ' together something exciting : A covey of uniformed men is shown climbing aboard a big jet . We 'll see much , much more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the jet . Voice off screen : " His father came to this country as an immigrant from Greece . His mother was born in this country . His name ? Spiro Agnew ! " Now we see Agnew coming off the plane and we get the title in big yellow letters : AGNEW ? Narrated by John Wayne . Wayne informs us that Agnew is on his way to visit eleven Asian nations on a 37,000-mile trip , " A journey of friendship . One man representing more than 200 million people . A journey across a world and back , but for Spiro Agnew it is all part of a longer and still continuing journey , one that in a ' few short years has brought him from , a comparative stranger to the majority of his fellow countrymen to the man who now stands at the side of the President of the United States of America . " Agnew is shown telephoning in the plane 's cabin . Wayne : " Where does the journey of a man 's lifeproperly begin ? In his boyhood , in Maryland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spiro Agnew it was a world in which imagination could become reality . All was possible . " A still photograph of young Agnew is flashed on screen , Then more shots of the plane , landing and taxiing . Agnew gets off plane , Filipino crowd cheers , somebody puts a lei around his neck . Scene moves to military graveyard where Agnew places wreath on tomb . Crowd cheers . Wayne : " Never before has a Vice President played such an important part in foreign policy . " Another picture of the Vice Presidential plane with Agnew reviewing troops in background . Wayne says that Agnew " appeals to any crowd . " One sign in this crowd spells it " Spero . " While Wayne recounts Agnew 's regard for civil rights and education , we see pictures of water buffaloes , then another shot of the plane . Into the new USIA color footage is spliced some old , brown , cracked film showing Agnew taking the oath of office as Goveinor of Maryland in 1966 . Then we are brought back to Asia to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shrine . The Vice Presidential plane is in the background . Agnew climbs aboard again . Wayne makes an indirect allusion to the race riots of ; Agnew 's term as Governor , and of how Agnew had suppressed the black militants . Wayne : " The country knew of him now  --  a man who spoke his mind . . . In July of 1968 , the greatest challenge of all . " Scene inside GOP convention hall . Nixon and Agnew embracing , balloons falling from ceiling . Crowd cheers . Next scene , . " Scene moves to Cape Kennedy blast-off site . Agnew puts on hard hat . Another picture of the V.P. plane , close up . Agnew steps inside the plane . Wayne : " Sometimes the voice of controversy , praised by some , denounced by others . But on one point there is agreement , he is still the man who speaks his mind . " Now we get a couple of rostrum shots as Agnew briefly scolds students and the pres . The airplane is in the background again . Wayne : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ journey remains . " Now the plane is right up next to the audience , overflowing the screen . Now it is on the ground , being wheeled quietly into a giant hangar . Wayne : " . . . constant process of renewal , of having been given , to give back . The challenge awaits the man . " Dramatic swelling of music . End . I had started watching the movie alone , but halfway through , a couple of men ? " squares " by their appearance , and very much of Agnew's-silent majority  --  had slipped into the viewing room and sat behind me . At Wayne 's last remark , one of them asked the other , " Now , what the hell did that mean ? " It was n't a smart-alecky response . Anyone of normal intelligence would have difficulty figuring out what that , or any other , portion of the movie was supposed to mean . It was an incredibly dull , shallow , lifeless movie about a man who , in middle age , could claim nothing but that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lucky breaks . A USIA film , needless to say , is not meant to be a definitive biography ; still , to be effective propaganda , it must make it appear that something in a man 's life was worth recording . Bruce Herschensohn , who was running the USIA film division at the time , told me that it was " a tough one . The material from stock shots was just awful . Nothing existed on the guy . Did n't anyone take any pictures of him when he was Governor ? There was nothing available . " Herschensohn 's crew had asked Agnew to let them take some pictures of him playing tennis or golf , or puttering around the house , but he had not wanted to do anything " stagy , " he said , so they were left with a blank until he took his trip to Asia . And yet in a way , it was a perfect film . Agnew comes through exactly as he is and as his talents are : he shakes hands , he says what is scripted for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected amount of emotion , he pats children , he takes junkets , he knows how to review troops and how to get on and off a plane . No more . For there is no more to him . Or very little . Or what else there is remains to be discovered . After four years of him , most Americans apparently have trouble making this obvious appraisal ; perhaps because it seems almost unpatriotic  --  or at least cynical  --  to acknowledge that the country 's second highest politician is simply a crass , ordinary mortal of limited talents and character ; not an entertaining buffoon , as the press attempted to portray him for the first couple of years , and not a dangerous schemer , or at least not yet dangerous in his own right , as the timorous beasties of the broadcasting industry have tried to make him seem . Agnew is just an extraordinarily definable example of the kind of hack who now and then drifts to the top of the muck in American politics . - Vanity has long since blinded him to his real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scene he still seemed to retain some awareness of his scantiness . Shortly after getting the Vice Presidential nomination in 1968 he said , " My public image is n't the greatest thing I 've ever seen . " Looking back over his life one must concede sympathetically that he had little to work with . Agnew was an average student at Forest Park High School in Baltimore : average grades , odd jobs after school , sandlot athletic life . His former classmates and teachers remember him as a pleasant , quiet , ordinary kid . His father , from all reports , was a strict disciplinarian , but not abusive . A native of Greece , he was 40 when Agnew was born ; this , plus the fact that he had had to humpit during the depression , left him little time to spend with his sons , and perhaps not as much patience with them as he might , otherwise have , 10d . FWhen Spiro began making poor grades at Johns Hopkins University ( majoring in chemistry , but not much interested in it ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a financial burden . He did . Agnew 's first full-time job was the kind of drudgery typical of " first " jobs : he clerked in the sprinkler-leakage department of an insurance company for $11 a week . He also started taking courses at the University of Baltimore Law School . The school had no national accreditation and survived on the very fringe of acceptability in the legal profession . After serving in World War II with some distinction ' ( he came out with a Bronze Star ) , Agnew finished law school . His first attempt at private practice was a failure . He worked briefly as an insurance adjuster and then tried law again . Again he failed . Next , he went to work as an assistant personnel manager for a Baltimore supermarket chain , but that dreaiy venture as a junior executive was interrupted when the Army called him back for a ye , ar 's duty during the Korean War ? service which , considering that by then Agnew had a wife and three kids , made him understandably bitter . The bitterness was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jules Witcover describes in White Knight : The Rise of Spiro Agnew , as " a - kind of glorified store detective-judge , to whom suspected shoplifters  --  usually caught with the goods  --  were brought to be ' broken down , ' and sentenced to out-of-court restitution . " Most of the store 's customers were black . Agnew is said to have got on well with the other employees , for whom he sometimes acted as a contract negotiator . Having sided with a worker once too often in a labor dispute , Agnew was fired ; but from his good relationship with the employees he picked up some minor labor negotiating work when he went back to practicing law . In the early 1950s Agnew , sprouting political ambitions of a modest sort , switched to the Republican Party ' on the advice of a more experienced friend , who pointed out that the Democratic byways were already glutted with ambitious young men . Parlaying PTA and Kiwanis and other neighborly connections , Agnew became chairman of a zoning appeals board . Then , profiting from an intraparty feud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  a post whose jurisdiction , however , excluded the most important urban center in the County , Baltimore itself . It was a fluke victory , which Agnew , knew no Republican could repeat in ' a county dominated by Democrats . ' So , instead of lingering around to be voted out of office , Agnew ran for governor . Once again the Democrats threw away victory and he picked it up . Moderates and liberals split their primary votes in such a way that the most conservative and most unappealing Democrat , George P. Mahoney , a- demagogue who Was always running for some office and losing , this time took the Democratic nomination . That was 1966 . Mahoney 's campaign slogan was " A Man 's Home Is His Castle ? Protect It . " With the nation and Maryland just beginning to show signs of making it through the civil rights maze , many Democrats refused to vote for a candidate going in the opposite direction . They - threw their votes to Agnew , who was playing it cool on the race issue and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ governorship by 81,775 votes , something he could never have done without the support of liberal Democrats in general , and Baltimore black Democrats in particular . Witcover likens Agnew 's governorship to Eisenhower 's Presidency . He was strictly a 9-to-5 executive , with weekends free and two afternoons during the week for golf . He depended on Marvin Mandel , then Speaker of the Maryland House ( now Governor ) , much as ' Eisenhower had depended on Senate Majority Leader Lyndon Johnson , for most of the legislative accomplishments of his term . Also like Ike , Agnew helped business cronies without being overtly crooked . Businessmen used his office almost as a lounge . His closest advisers and friends were businessmen . Though there were many rumors of under-the-table deals between Agnew and his moneyed pals , nothing has been proven . When he was county executive he had bought land with eight businessmen , some of whom had done abundant business with the county and whom he should have held at arm 's length to avoid any appearance of impropriety . Apparently fearing that this land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he sold out to his business partners . A smudge on his record as Governor was the selling of 176 acres of Maryland 's wetlands to a developer ' for $100 an acre , despite recommendations from the State Board of Natural Resources , the Department of Inland Game and Fish , the Department of Water Resources , and the staff of the Rnard of Puhlie Works that the land not he sold . The developer subdivided the land into lots selling forup to $7,300 each , or about $90,000 an acre . With the kind of unfathomable ego that little politicians possess , Agnew always viewed himself as a kingmaker . In 1963 he cast his benign gaze upon Sen. Thomas Kuchel of California , a rather liberal and decent lightweight , and decided that he would make a good President . Agnew traveled to Washington to tell the Senator so . But 1964 was to be Goldwater 's year , and just about nobody but Agnew was even considering Kuchel . The kingmaking itch began to afflict Agnew again in 1967 , and this time his hand reached out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom Agnew said , " I feel a tremendous sense of need to have a candidate of the Rockefeller type . " Rockefeller repeatedly tried to get Agnew to stop daydreaming , but Agnew ? insisted. , On March 21 , 1968 , when Rockefeller was to go on TV to announce his " irrevocable " decision , Agnew was still so certain that he had persuaded Rockefeller to run that he gathered favored Maryland politicians and newsmen around him and switched on the set . When Rocky came on and announced that he would n't actively campaign , one reporter said , " Spiro 's jaw just sagged . " The popular interpretation of what then occurredis that , because Rockefeller had made his negative decision without privately informing his champion , Agnew felt himself so humiliated that he quit the " liberal " wing of the party from spite . One is to see here the bitter transformation of a rejected suitor . The events of the next few weeks are supposed to fit into that picture . Black students at Bowie State College , who were trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , staged a peaceful demonstration . Then , after Martin Luther King 's assassination , Baltimore had a humdinger of a race riot . Agnew reacted excessively to both events . His troopers arrested hundreds of the students and locked them out of their dormitories . And after the post-assassination riots , Agnew called in 100 or so black leaders  --  all moderates  --  and raised hell with them because they had seemed to sympathize with some of the militants . He lectured them in the pious style that was later to become nationally famous . And he made sure that the network TV1 cameramen were on hand for his debut in unabashed bigotry . A little earlier he , had told newsmen privately , " I 've tried to be liberal , but at some point you have to stop leading the people and start following them . " This was his first public display of what he meant . Some observers saw it as a change of heart ; some saw it simply as a change of candidates . If he could n't ride Rocky 's coattails , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what the confrontation was all about . " It was calculated to create a conservative image for political purposes , " says Mitchell . ' " After Rockefeller insulted him , I believe Agnew decided he had to cast his lot with the conservatives . " Apparently the shift turned the trick . After the 1968 convention , one of Nixon 's top aides admitted that " most of us did n't know anything about him except that he had chewed out some blacks . " Actually his realignment was something less than abrupt . Agnew had never been more than mildly tolerant of black demands for equal treatment . As Baltimore County  - -   - -  five , he tea . ' effs.t3 LV E , VL tions started for the integration of six swimming pools ; but when the blacks complained that he was moving entirely too slowly , Agnew became sullen and stopped negotiating altogether . Nothing he had said or done prior to getting the Vice Presidential nomination was , in fact , at much variance with what he said thereafter : " You do n't learn from people suffering from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I do not believe that demonstrations , lawful or unlawful , merit even my silence . " " I think the civil rights revolution went too far the day the revolution started . " ? " I never would have allowed the poverty marchers ' to camp in Resurrection City . I would have used the steps taken in Chicago to rout them from public ground . " " It is not evil conditions that cause riots , but evil men . " The only concessions he would make were along the line of his statement on September 21 , 1968 , " Senator Thurmond has n't been as interested in achieving some aims Of the black " community as civil rights leaders . " The important lesson to learn froin his abuse of the black leaders after the Baltimore riots is that Agnew overreacts in a crisis . Oddly enough , President Nixon has said on a number of occasions that what he likes best about his Vice President is that " when it gets down to the final tough decision , he is , from my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who therefore could be expected to make decisions in the future in a calm , cool , judicial way . " Agnew is anything but cool under fire , nor is he cool in a situation where his ego is in jeopardy . Jerry Tallmer , writing a six-part profile of the Vice President for the New York Post in 1970 , talked to a Baltimore attorney who had known Agnew for twenty years . He said , " If everything 's going nicely , he 's fine . The minute somebody disappoints him , he acts badly . When he says he has n't changed , he has n't changed . That speech where he bawled out the moderate Negroes here , after the riots ? that was Agnew , pure Agnew . They disappointed him . " Regarding Agnew 's tantrum after the Bowie State College demonstration , a ' Maryland reporter told Tallmer , " It 's the one thing he ca n't stand , a threat to his authority . It 's happened over and over again , but that was the first time the people of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too canny to lose his temper except when he feels he 's got the upper hand . When he was , a lowly county executive , he almost slavishly followed the editorial lead of the Baltimore Sun . When the Sun recommended action , he obeyed ; when it criticized , he pulled his forelock . But no sooner was he Vice President than Agnew gaVe it back to the Sun in full measure ; when it criticized him , he responded by refusing to allow Sun reporters to travel with him . Agnew is something of a bully . When he has the advantage , he sounds off like a benign dictator . Td critics of " the Establishment , " he said in 1968 , " You may give us your symptoms . We will make the diagnosis . And we , the Establishment  --  for which I make no apologies for being part of  --  will implement the cure . " But when he runs into a bloc that is too powerful for him to budge , he becomes sullen and quits gracelessly . For a long time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In 1968 he made a number of bloopers on the campaign trail  --  the " fat Jap " and " Polack " miscues ; the remark that " when you 've seen one slum you 've seen them all " ; the complaint that Chief Justice Warren 's failure stemmed not from his " ability as a lawyer or as a judge but his sensibility as a Republican appointee " ; the profundity of such insights as " Youth lacks , to some extent , experience " ; his description of Hubert Humphrey one day as " soft on inflation , soft on communism and soft on law and order , " and three days later changing that to " Hubert Humphrey is a loyal American and a man of great integrity " ; his judgment that the United States " is the greatest nation in the country " ? which the press gave the full treatment , so full in fact , that for a time Nixon 's advisers played " Hide the Veep . " He was an embarrassment . The experiences of 1968 left him totally burned , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give interviews . Then , finally , thinking he was submitting himself to a friend , he gave a Fortune magazine reporter a two-hour interview . Of that ; Fortune used one small quote . Furious , Agnew once again retreated into his shell . The Senate has been another bloc Agnew could n't lick , and from which he consequently retreated sullenly . When he became Vice President  --  the first man in twenty-four years to reach that office without experience in Congress  --  he presided over the Senate with an enthusiasm that had not been seen in that chair for a long time . The very fact that he presided was a novelty ; most Vice Presidents avoid the chore . Once Sen. Alan Cranston of California , having just stepped down after spelling Agnew at the gavel for an hour , confided : " Presiding over the Senate takes absolutely no skill at all . Some people try to build up the job , but there 's nothing to it . You 'd have to be a fool to make a mistake . You do n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the advice of the parliam  --  ntarian : " Not realizing-the low repute of the job , Agnew pitched into it with a will . But then he became cocky and overreached himself ; he began lobbying for the Administration on specific bills . Senators began cutting him cold . Sen. Len Jordan of his own party announced publicly that he would automatically vote against any bill that Agnew lobbied for . This , known as " the Jordan Rule , " was applauded by his colleagues . One puncture and Agnew was deflated . After that , he was seldom seen around the Senate . " The pattern worries some Republicans , " a Capitol Hill reporter noted at the time , " since it has occurred before : Agnew has a tendency to give up and turn away when rebuffed . " Like other Vice Presidents before him , Agnew quickly became disenchanted and frustrated from serving as chairman of such nitwit outfits as the President 's Council on Physical Fitness . He wanted action , and was only too happy to serve as the President 's traveling stooge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put it , " Nixon 's Nixon . " It was the good-cop/bad-cop routine . Nixon maintained a bland rhetoric in the White House , only occasionally slipping , as when he called campus protesters " bums " ; Agnew rolled across the countryside pursuing a scorched-earth policy . He called for " positive polarization . " Of anti-war protesters he said , " It is time to sweep that kind of garbage out of our society . . . to separate them from our society with no more regret than we should feel over discarding rotten apples from a barrel . " He scoffed at " the agonizing of a police officer who could n't bring himself to kill a looter over a pair of shoes , " calling this " insidious relativism . " He charged that the leaders of the October 15 , 1969 , Moratorium were " hard-core dissidents and professional anarchists . " We were being victimized by the Constitution , he implied , for " democracy 's greatest flaw rests in its intransigent commitment to individual freedom . " And always he was poised to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rhetoric as , " Abetting the merchants of hate are the parasites of passion , the ideological eunuchs whose most comfortable position is straddling the philosophical fence . " By " throwing my audiences a little red meat , " Agnew became for a while the most sought-after speaker on the GOP circuit . His popularity crested with an attack on the press , especially the television press , in a speech before a regional meeting of the Midwest Republican Committee in Des Moines in November 1969 , when he charged that the newscasters and commentators were oriented to the parochialism of Washington and New York and that " it 's time we questioned such power in the hands of a small and unelected elite . The great networks have dominated America 's airwaves for decades . The people are entitled to a full accounting of their stewardship . " Network officials , who feel constantly under the gun of the Federal Communications Commission ( which in turn is appointed by and constantly influenced by the White House ) , interpreted this outburst as a direct , threat . Each network @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the arbitrary generosity of the FCC . The FCC could take them away , though it has rarely canceled a major TV license . Frank Stanton , president of CBS , said through chattering teeth , " This is an unprecedented attempt by the Vice President to intimidate a news medium . " Inasmuch as the networks offer such awful news coverj age , the printed press snickered and tittered at their discomfort for a few days . But then in a speech in Montgomery , Ala. , Agnew unloaded on The New York Times and The Washington Post , damning them as biased left wingers . They were , he said , the terrible result of a continuing concentration of power in the hands of a few newspapers . Now it was the printed press 's turn to growl and grumph about efforts at news management . But , as in his complaints about the networks , there was obviously enough truth in what Agnew said to make the press feel vulnerable . And a squirmy press was a very appealing sight to much of the public , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lie the most . None of this squabble would have been of any importance except that it was quite obvious that Agnew spoke for Nixon . Clark Mollenhoff , then a special counsel to Nixon , said publicly that Agnew " reflected the views of the Administration . " A White House aide told Newsweek that Agnew 's attacks were " carefully orchestrated . " According to columnist Kevin Phillips , who was once an aide to John Mitchell and retains close ties to the Administration , Agnew 's anti-press speeches , as well as most of his other on-the-road keynote speeches , were made on orders straight from Nixon . The cheap thrill to be had from listening to Agnew was the knowledgd that , somewhere in the wings , Richard , the Black Knight , was rubbing his hands in delight and smirking the old smirk that libertarians have learned to fear . And Nixon just might have the wherewithal to make Agnew 's threats mean something . On the night of the Des Moines speech , says Phillips , " President Nixon was watching it on television with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to speech writer Pat Buchanan . " As for Agnew , says Phillips , he did not like the press , in fact he disliked the press very much , but he took on these chores with heavy heart because he thought they would kill him politically . Phillips says that after the Des Moines speech , " the Vice President repaired to his hotel room and , as the drinks were poured , said pretty much as follows : ' Well , they Nixon , et al. really me this time . After this speech , I might as well give up . I can never run again . The media will kill me . ' " As it turned out , of course , the media did n't lay a hand on him . Television turned servile under his criticisms , and Agnew benefited by seeming to be a giant killer . He was no longer sorry that he had been rough , and began to see himself as the great , broadsword reformer . Within the year he was claiming to have forced the networks to straighten up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " ( The Agnew impact is seen in the coverage of the Presidential campaign . McGovern 's aide , Frank Mankiewicz , justifiably complains that because of " some of the blows that they 've received from this Administration , " the networks will follow their reporting of a McGovern speech by hunting up " two assistant aldermen somewhere who 'll say they did n't like it , so that there can be some kind of balance . " ) With the robust publicity victories of 1969 egging him on , Agnew plowed into the election year of 1970 with as little caution or balance as a rhino defending its young . There seemed to be no limit to his gaucherie , and no target beyond his reach . At an Ohio Republican dinner in June , he clearly implied that Averell Harriman had helped imprison Poland behind the iron curtain in return for a gift of two thoroughbred horses from Stalin . When Yale 's president , Kingman Brewster , suggested that Black Panthers could not get a fair trial , Agnew urged Yale 's alumni to throw him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 900 black students whose scholastic background did not qualify them for entrance under the usual rules , Agnew ridiculed the university 's president , Robben Fleming , as " a marshmallow " and accused him of having " buckled under to a few squads of kid extortionists . " On the political trail Agnew was even more rambunc-tious . , His hatred for Republican Sen. Charles Goodell , running for re-election in New York , was so intense that he likened him to Christine Jorgensen , celebrated as the recipient of an operation that changed his sex . Goodell , once a conservative Congressman , had become something of a liberal in the Senate and had opposed the Adminis-tration 's war policies . Agnew concocted a rather laughable list of " radical liberals , " on which were the names of Sens . Adlai Stevenson III of Illinois , Harrison Williams of New Jersey , Philip Hart of Michigan , , and , of all people , Howard Cannon of Nevada . He went stomping into Arkansas to denounce Sen. William Fulbright ( who was n't even running ) ? as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Democratic gubernatorial candidate , Dale Bumpers , as the " grin and grunt " candidate . ' It was a great barnstorming show . Like never before , the Republican faithful turned out to hear him and laugh ; he raised a phenomenal $3.5 million for the GOP treasury . But there is something more important than money ; there is the matter of winning . And even before the campaign was over Republican Party professionals sensed that Agnew was doing more harm than good . From the conservative wing Kevin Phillips said , " Agnew 's gone stale . He sounds like a broken record . " On the Left , Lee Auspitz , president of the Ripon Society , said , " Agnew 's ratings , like those of Milton Berle two decades ago , have begun to turn sour . " It was true . Less than two weeks before the election , a Louis Harris poll showed that 50 per cent of the sampling felt that he was doing a poor job . Furthermore , 88 per cent of those polled said that , if Agnekv asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his appeal would leave them totally indifferent or would make them want to vote the other way . Only in the Goodell race did he seem to have the effect he had sought . His attack rallied enough liberal Democratic support to the Senator and away from the Democratic nominee , Richard Ottinger , and so split the liberal-moderate strength that the ConserVative Party candidate , James Buckley , won the seat . ( Watching returns on election night , Agnew said of Goodell , " We got that son of a bitch . " ) The GOP won two Senate seats , but lost nine in the House ; the Democrats gained eleven gubernatorial offices . Agnew 's part in the disaster caused widespread grumbling . Gov . Winthrop Rockefeller , who lost in Arkansas , told acquaintances after Agnew had passed through : " Now I know why my brother Gov . Nelson Rockefeller keeps him out of New York . " Dissatisfaction with the heavy-handedness of his attack was so prevalent among GOP state executives that Agnew went to a governors ' conference in Sun Valley to explain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chop their nuts off , " he said , " before - they chop off yours . " Anyway , why were they blaming him ? " Any schoolchild would know , " he said , " the Vice President is just an extension of the President . " And publicly he acknowledged that his role as the hatchet man had been on " assignment . " Thereafter there was increasing talk of finding a way to dump Agnew in 1972 . But who was doing the talking ? Not Nixon ; not the right wing . Early in 1971 The Christian Science Monitor polled GOP state chairmen and national committee members ; fifty-four said they thought Agnew should tone down his remarks , only thirty-two thought he should n't . But that minority represented the very , people Nixon needed to pacify by keeping Agnew at his side . They represented the likes of the Southern Republican who said , " I keep reading about efforts to clean him up . That could cost him popularity down our way . We prefer the dirty old version . " , To be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he criticized the Ping-Pong exchange just when Kissinger was in the middle of most delicate negotiations to get Nixon into Red China . At the same time , it was extremely important to have that criticism of the Red Chinese because ( 1 ) coming from within the Administration it disarmed the right-wing kooks ; and ( 2 ) coming from Agnew it made Nixon seem like a moderate . Still , there was always the chance that Agnew might run off at the mouth just once too often ; so to keep him out of the way while Kissinger completed the Red China deal , Nixon sent him off on a round-the-world tour that included buttering up Franco and praising African black dictators as being the sort " U.S. blacks could learn much from . " The White House dissociated itself from Agnew 's overseas remarks , and this caused another flurry of speculation that Nixon would dump him . A liberal GOP Senator said at the time , " There 's hardly anyone left among Republicans up here who thinks he 'll be on the ticket in 1972 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any more of that Spiro 's our hero ' business . Now , when his name is mentioned , you get a general scrunching of the shoulders . " There were rumors he might be got rid of via an appointment to the Supreme Court , but Agnew laughed at the idea he would take such an appointment . In November 1971 , Phillips wrote in The New York Times Magazine : " Perhaps Agnew 's image , like Humpty Dumpty , can not be put back together again  --  at least while he is in office . Few people at the White House even want to make the effort . Many of the President 's top staffers ? Ehrlichman , Rumsfeld , Finch , Leonard Garment and Clark MacGregor ? want Agnew dumped rather than rehabilitated . Besides which , some influential Congressional Republicans are giving Agnew mere lip service , while they jockey to replace him . " Phillips reported true support only in the South and Southwest . GOP ' liberals , of course , were not overjoyed at the idea of another four years with Agnew . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " After he 's been around about three years and has had his tail kicked a few times , I think he 'll be a pretty good man , " had long ago changed his mind about that . Even such a centrist Republican organ as Life joined the dump-Agnew chorus . So Agnew 's ultimate success in staying on the ticket  --  apparently it was an easy victory  --  must prove at least one thing : the lasting power of the GOP 's far-right wing . That element of the party had not been shy about letting Nixon know where it stood before the convention , The 67,000-member Young Americans for Freedom rebuffed Nixon after he had become friendly with China and Russia and nominated Agnew for President . Goldwater and Tower cheerfully acknowledged that in their circles Agnew was more popular than the President . Rep. John Ashbrook , who challenged Nixon from the Right in some primaries , was a howling flop , but his devotees argued that at least they would scare Nixon enough to win one concession ? Agnew . Lee Edwards , a Washington public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FBI , headed up a new group called Americans for Agnew . That sort of activity was visible to the President for months before Miami Beach . The reason for the right wing 's love of Agnew is one of those things that a non-right winger finds hardto understand . His record is not that conservative . Stanton Evans , chairman of the American Conservative Union , tried recently in National Review to explain the love . He acknowledged that " on the whole , one would not rate Agnew 's position on matters of domestic economy as conservative " ; he conceded that in matters of foreign policy Agnew 's , concepts are vague but seem to be no more ultra than " moderate-conservative and trending to the Right " ; he admitted that Agnew was used by Nixon only as ideological bait ? " the Agnew function within the Administration is largely conceived as that of massaging the conservative interest , . . . to keep the Right securely tethered to the Administration . " Despite all these defects , Evans still sees Agnew as a powerful force for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wing 's sounding board , its inspiration , its surrogate . " When the second highest official in the land speaks out in right-wing tones , " wrote Evans , " a genie is released which all - the minions of the Establishment will find difficult to stuff back into its opaque bottle . " As a matter of fact , Agnew himself does not even have to sound very Right . Some men seem to have a talent for inflaming kooks without actually saying anything very extreme . Agnew has that gift , or mystique , to use Nixon 's appraisal ? " There can be a mystique about a man . You can look him in the eye and you know he 's got it . This guy has got it . " After Agnew 's attacks on the press , major publishers noticed a sharp upswing in their hate mail , especially anti-Semitic letters , for the kooks are convinced that the press is controlled by " Jew-Commies . " Norman B. Isaacs , executive editor of the Louisville Courier-Journal , president- of the American Society of Newspaper Editors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to respond . As a result , he said , he was " literally buried under an avalanche of sick mail . " Agnew 's remarks are often picked up and reprinted , with praise and purple embellishments , in such organs as H. L. Hunt 's Life Lines and Dr. Billy James Hargis ' Christian Crusade Weekly . In addition , Agnew has been the White House 's ambassador to private conferences with bankers and corporation executives who think Nixon himself is a radic-lib . He is still playing , as Marquis Childs put it , " Mr. Hyde to the President 's benign Dr. Jekyll . " And he can still excuse himself  --  as he did at the 1972 convention  --  as being only a loyal tool : " Much of the controversy about the Vice Presidency could be quieted if we would accept the fact that the Vice President is the , President 's man and not a competing political entity , " That may have been true during the first four years , but if Agnew is being groomed as Nixon 's successor , he will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is little doubt that , as of now , he has - the inside track . The rules adopted this year at the Republican convention were carefully shaped to make it easier to select delegates in 1976 who will go for the most conservative candidate . Agnew is obviously the candidate whom the Right has in mind . He will play along ; his success so far has depended on his ability to " release the genie " from the bottle , and it 's unlikely that he will abandon a winning formula . The most disheartening thing about the Agnew epic is not that such a hollow man attained so lofty a position in American politics , or that the only spirits he seems to lift are generically those of the pass-the-bucket preachers in Tulsa . The really disheartening thing about it is that many decent politicians seem to be so cheerfully fatalistic about the prospect of his rising higher . " He 's very limited , intellectually and otherwise , " Sen. Mark Hatfield , Oregon Republican , once observed . " He appeals to the prejudices of the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office . " Read that last sentence aloud and , see what it does to you : Agnew might grow in the office . ?
