Viet Nam peace negotiations have by now acquired a certain dj vu quality . Presidential Adviser Henry Kissinger and North Viet Nam 's Le Due Tho confer in Paris and make a tentative deal . <P> Then Kissinger , or an aide , flies off to Saigon to win the concurrence of South Vietnamese President Nguyen Van Thieu , who raises some objections . The two principal negotiators go back to Paris to resolve the difficulties . That is the point at which Kissinger will find himself this week when he once again meets Those in an attempt to resuscitate the faltering Viet Nam truce . <P> In Washington last week , Kissinger stressed that this supposedly final round of talks " concerns almost entirely methods of implementation rather than renegotiation . " The discussions were necessary , he went on , because of a lack of " willingness to observe provisions that are clearly understood " - apparently a reference to Saigon as well as Hanoi . <P> Translated into plain English , Kissinger 's statement amounted to an unhappy admission that fighting has continued in the four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their questionable accuracy , figures released last week by Saigon reflect the level of violence : 21,455 Communist and 5,510 South Vietnamese soldiers killed , at least 3,530 civilians dead or wounded . <P> Neither Side . To be sure , there have been some notable changes since January . American G.I.s have gone home , prisoners have been exchanged , and Viet Cong officers-escorted always by South Vietnamese security troops-drive around Saigon . There is also the ineffectual presence of the four-nation International Commission of Control and Supervision ( ICCS ) , created to monitor the adherence of both sides to the truce . The Hungarian and Polish commission members , who consider themselves Hanoi 's representatives , have employed dilatory and obstructionist tactics to prevent the Canadian and Indonesian members from investigating reported truce violations . Last week External Affairs Minister Mitchell Sharp announced that Canada would quit the paralyzed , dissension-torn ICCS at the end of July . A high-ranking Canadian official privately explained that his government was tired of trying " to supervise a peace that is kept by neither side . " <P> The decision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had urged the Canadians to stay on , arguing that in another month or so many of the frustrating problems of the ICCS might be resolved . Convinced that Canada 's decision is final , the State Department has sounded out Brazil and Mexico as possible replacements .
