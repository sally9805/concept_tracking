Beginning five minutes before the houselights come down , the following announcements are broadcast over the loudspeaker . A woman 's voice is preferred , a droning tone is essential. @x The play is set in a dingy one-room apartment in a rundown section of downtown Louisville , Kentucky . There is a twin bed and one chair . There is a sink , an apartment-size combination stove and refrigerator , and a counter with cabinets above . Dirty curtains conceal the bars on the outside of the single window . There is one closet and a door to the bathroom . The door to the apartment opens into a hall . A catwalk stretches above the apartment and a prison cell , stage right , connects to it by stairways . An area downstage and another stage left complete the enclosure of the apartment by playing areas for the past . The apartment must seem imprisoned . Following the prologue , lights fade to black and the warden 's voice is heard on tape . WARDEN The Alabama State Parole Board hereby grants parole to Holsclaw , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Correctional Institute for the second-degree murder of a cab driver in conjunction with a filling station robbery involving attempted kidnapping of attendant . Crime occurred during escape from Lakewood State Prison where subject Holsclaw was serving three years for forgery and prostitution . Extensive juvenile records from the state of Kentucky appended hereto . ( As the warden continues , light comes up on Arlene , walking around the cell , waiting to be picked up for the ride home . Arlie is visible , but just barely , down center. ) p. 4 WARDEN Subject now considered completely rehabilitated is returned to Kentucky under interstate parole agreement in consideration of family residence and appropriate support personnel in the area . Subject will remain under the supervision of Kentucky parole officers for a period of five years . Prospects for successful integration into community rated good . Psychological evaluation , institutional history , and health records attached in Appendix C , this document . BENNIE Arlie ! ( Arlene leaves the cell as light comes up on Arlie , seated down center . She tells this story rather simply . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . She may be doing some semiabsorbing activity such as painting her toenails . ) ARLIE So , there was this little kid , see , this creepy little fucker next door . Had glasses an somethin ' wrong with his foot . I do n't know , seven , maybe . Anyhow , ever time his daddy went fishin ' , he 'd bring this kid back some frogs . They built this little fence around ' em in the backyard like they was pets or somethin ' . An we 'd try to go over an see ' em but he 'd start screamin ' to his mother to come out an git rid of us . Real snotty like . So we got sick of him bein ' such a goody-goody an one night me an June snuck over there an put all his dumb ol ' frogs in this sack . You never heared such a fuss . ( Makes croaking sounds . ) Slimy bastards , frogs . We was plannin ' to let ' em go all over the place , but when they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was askin ' for it . So , we taken ' em out front to the porch an we throwed ' em , one at a time , into the street . ( Laughs . ) Some of ' em hit cars goin ' by but most of ' em jus ' got squashed , you know , runned over ? It was great , seein ' how far we could throw ' em , over back of our backs an under our legs an God , it was really fun watchin ' ' em fly through the air then splat ( Claps hands. ) all over somebody 's car window or somethin ' . Then the next day , we was waitin ' and this little kid comes out in his backyard lookin ' for his stupid frogs and he do n't see any an he gets so crazy , cryin ' and everything . So me an June goes over an tells him we seen this big mess out in the street , an he goes out an sees all them frogs ' legs and bodies an shit all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so funny . We ' bout killed ourselves laughin ' . Then his mother come out and she would n't let him go out an pick up all the pieces , so he jus ' had to stand there watchin ' all the cars go by smush his little babies right into the street . I 's gon na run out an git him a frog 's head , but June yellin ' at me " Arlie , git over here fore some car slips on them frog guts an crashes into you . " ( Pause . ) I never had so much fun in one day in my whole life . ( Arlie remains seated as Arlene enters the apartment . It is late evening . Two sets of footsteps are heard coming up the stairs . Arlene opens the door and walks into the room . She stands still , surveying the littered apartment . Bennie is heard dragging a heavy trunk up the stairs . Bennie is wearing his guard uniform . He is a heavy man , but obviously used to physical work. ) p. 5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . BENNIE Arlene ? ( Bringing the trunk just inside the door . ) ARLENE Leave it . I 'll git it later . BENNIE Oh , now , let me bring it in for you . You ai n't as strong as you was . ARLENE I ai n't as mean as I was . I 'm strong as ever . You go on now .

( Arlie laughs . ) ARLENE That 's what you think I been waitin ' for ? ( A guard appears and motions for Arlie to follow him . ) ARLIE Yeah ! I heard ya .

Pull them out . BENNIE You ca n't go tearin ' up the place , Arlene , Landlord would n't like it . ARLIE ( To the unseen policeman . ) Maybe I got a brick in my hand and maybe I do n't .

Bennie leaves the cell area , motioning to the other guard as if to say , " See , that 's how it 's done . " A loud siren goes by in the street below the apartment . Arlene bolts up out of bed , then turns back to it quickly , making it up in a frenzied , ritual manner . As she tucks the spread up under the pillow , the siren stops and so does she . For the first time , now , she realizes where she is and the inappropriateness of the habit she has just played out . A jackhammer noise gets louder . She walks over to the window and looks out . There is a wolf whistle from a worker below . She shuts the window in a fury . She looks around the room as if trying to remember what she is doing there . She looks at her watch , now aware that it is late and that she has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep in their clothes , Arlene . An people git up fore noon . ( Arlene makes a still-disoriented attempt to pull herself together  --  changing shoes , combing her hair , washing her face  --  as prison life continues on the catwalk .

ARLIE It wo n't make no sense . WARDEN They 'll go through it all very slowlywhen you 're eligible for parole , how many days of good time you have , how many industrial days you 've earned , what constitutes meritorious good timeand how many days you 're set back for your write-ups and all your time in segregation . p. 69 ARLIE I do n't even remember what I done to git this lockup . WARDEN Well , I do . And if you ever do it again , or anything like it again , you 'll be right back in lockup where you will stay until how to do it . ARLIE What was it ?

I said , the chaplain will be coming by to visit you today . ( To an unseen guard . ) Mrs. Roberts , why has n't this light bulb been replaced ? ARLIE ( Screaming . ) Get out of my hall ! ( The warden walks away . Arlene walks to the refrigerator and opens it . She picks out the carton of slaw Bennie put there last night . She walks away from the door , then turns around , remembering to close it . She looks at the slaw , as a guard comes up to Arlie 's cell with a plate. ) p. 70 ARLIE I ai n't never eatin ' no more scrambled eggs . CALDWELL Chow time , cutie pie .

Finally , as she is walking out , she stops and looks at the picture of Jesus , then moves closer , having noticed a dirty spot . She goes back into the bathroom for a tissue , wets it in her mouth , then dabs at the offending spot .

She takes off her scarf and sets down her purse , still looking at the spilled groceries . Finally , she bends down and picks up the package of pickle loaf . She starts to put it on the counter , then turns suddenly and throws it at the door . She stares at it as it falls . ) ARLENE Bounce ? ( In disgust . ) Shit . ( Arlene sinks to the floor .
