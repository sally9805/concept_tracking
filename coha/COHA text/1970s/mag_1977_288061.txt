Giving burn patients the say <P> A woman , admitted to the hospital with severe burns covering 95% of her body , asks a doctor if she is going to die . The physician replies carefully that although he can not predict the future , survival in cases like hers is unprecedented . Does the woman want ordinary medical care or maximum-effort treatment , involving the use of life-prolonging machines ? She chooses the ordinary care , consisting basically of painkillers and intravenous fluids , and dies quietly within hours . <P> This procedure , allowing terminal burn patients to choose death , in effect , sooner rather than later , has been in use at the Los Angeles County-University of Southern California Medical Center 's burn unit for two years . During that time , 21 of 24 patients diagnosed as " having injury without precedent of survival " have chosen ordinary medical care and an earlier death . The other three - all men characterized by hospital personnel as " take charge types " in their 50s or 60s - also died ; the longest survivor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the patient - and not relatives - to decide is feasible in massive burn cases because the victim 's nerve endings are anesthetized by the injury , leaving him lucid and free of pain for the first several hours . In fact , says Dr. Bruce Zawacki , 42 , head of the burn unit , relatives have been " overwhelmingly relieved " that the burden of decision making is taken off their shoulders . Says Zawacki : " In the long run it is better for our mental health and the patients ' mental health to lay the cards on the table . " Part of the policy is increased attention to the dying patient 's need for compassionate human contact . Says Nurse Sharon Imbus : " We are very pro-life here , but if you choose ordinary medical care , we will be with you . We will stay with you . You wo n't be alone . "
