FAT CITY <P> Directed by JOHN HUSTON Screenplay by LEONARD GARDNER <P> " Everybody dies , " says a hustler in Body and Soul , one of the most memorable of all films about boxing . In Fat City , one of the least memorable , we watch a stifling process of human degradation symbolized by the desperate , random violence of tank-town prizefighting . Fat City is about a bunch of losers dying in spirit by slow , murderous inches . It lacks any substantial portion of compassion , however , any shred of insight to lift it above the level of a slumming expedition . <P> There was a time when John Huston understood such people and such desperation . A comparison between his evocative rendering of being on the bum in Tampico in The Treasure of Sierra Madre and the windbag theatrics of stumbling around Stockton , Calif. , in Fat City is a measure of how careless an artist Huston has become . The movie is offhandedly shot , with none of Huston 's old feeling for the look and the effluence of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , aloof and even slightly indifferent . <P> Leonard Gardner 's script ( adapted from his novel ) is a loosely strung series of miniature moral defeats that might be called character vignettes if there were any humanity in them . Tully ( Stacy Keach ) is a drunk , forever down on his luck and looking for a job , who has n't had a fight in a year and a half . His dismal life with a rummy mis tress ( Susan Tyrell ) and his struggles to get back into boxing are intercut with the exploits of a younger but no more hopeful fighter ( Jeff Bridges ) , who mar ries because he has to and promises to end up pretty much like Tully himself . <P> Huston can not wring a moment of pathos out of any of this , although there are fleeting moments of perception , as when a manager carelessly tosses a pair of newly bloodied trunks to another fighter , or when Tully stands in front of the mirror trying on some seedy clothes belonging to his girl 's former lover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Keach looks far too intelligent for the part . Although he does many tech nical things splendidly , he lacks emo tional force . Bridges , who was fine in The Last Picture Show , is at loose ends here , and Actress Tyrell 's grandstand histrionics turn a surefire part into a Raggedy Ann caricature.
