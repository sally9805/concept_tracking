THE TALK OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment IT has come to light that the United States government and its South Vietnamese allies are planning a mass deportation within South Vietnam that appears virtually certain to open an entirely new and bloody chapter in the Indo-China war . A recent story in the Times reveals that a project to deport hundreds of thousands of people  --  and , in the end , perhaps millions  --  from the five northernmost provinces of South Vietnam to southern provinces is " now in its final planning stages . " So Ear , the American and South Vietnamese government officials concerned have been covering up the enormity of this measure with the customary euphemisms . In the Times article , a Vietnamese official says that several " village representatives " from northern provinces will he brought down to the south to look at the land where their villages are to he relocated , as though to suggest that this forced mass deportation would he nothing more than a kind of real-estate deal . In reality , if this brutal project is carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ openly totalitarian act in the history of this nation 's relations with other nations , and one of the few such acts in any nation 's history . The closest precedent may be the Soviet Union 's infamous deportation in the nineteen-thirties of Ukrainians , White Russians , Armenians , Jews , and Georgians to Siberia . It is true , of course , that through bombing and through thousands of small-scale projects of forced deportation the American military have already uprooted something like six million Vietnamese from their homes . The obliteration of their villages was also covered up with euphemisms  --  words and phrases such as " pacification , " " resettlement , " " rural development , " and " Operation County Fair . " At the " county fairs , " along with free buffet lunches from portable Army kitchens , piped-in music , showings of cartoons and propaganda movies , and handouts of candy to the children , there were offered such novel attractions as the torture of the customers and the machine-gunning from helicopters of anyone who did n't want to attend . In cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resettlement " ( and who can doubt that the current project of mass " resettlement " will he met with heavy resistance ? ) , the military very often simply bombed the village out of existence . These are the true precedents for the new plan , and they afford the best indications of what its execution will bring . Yet , terrible as the effect of these policies has been , the policies have been different in several crucial aspects from what is now being proposed . The forced emigrations and the killings of civilians that have so far taken place have occurred in a twilight zone of public confusion and half-knowledge and with official approval that has been only tacit . The new project , on the other hand , can not take place without the full and energetic support of the entire military command and civilian administration , and without being fully and frankly announced to the American public and to the world as a major new policy of the United States government . Ordinarily , this is the kind of plan that it is better not even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the risk of making it seem acceptable , The Marines , and the Army units that of helping to raise it from the level of joined diem in the spring of 1967 , ad-a wild , unthinkable scheme to the level justed quickly to this unexpected situaof one of those myriad " options " that tion and altered their strategy accord-the government is " keeping open .

And if they did not announce to And one wants at all costs to avoid the world that they were fighting a war adding one 's voice to the voices of the against nearly the entire population of official analysts who , for a price , will the provinces they were in , they did discuss , in their own weird , ambiguous , announce it to the South Vietnamese pseudo-scientific language , the " pluses " people . In leaflets titled , among other and " minuses " of any option , scenario , things , " Marine Ultimatum to Victor game plan that is put before them , namese People , " they announced a whether for building an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carrying out mass murder . How- loges in South Vietnam that supported ever , since the current project of mass the National Liberation Front in any deportation has moved beyond the op- way . After this policy had been in eftion stage and got into the planning feet for about two years , most of the stage , one is compelled to discuss it . In villages in these provinces had been bombed , and about half of the population of these provinces was living in camps . Every soldier , whatever he had been told before he arrived in South Vietnam , learned from hitter personal experience that he was engaged in a war against the South Vietnamese people . The bomber pilots who bombed villages day after day knew it ; the Psychological Warfare officers who dropped leaflets knew it ; the GIs --  who were indeed often attacked by small children and old women , as they have claimed  --  knew it . The highest levels of the military acknowledged this situation in many of their statements , although in other statements they denied it . Some officers began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is said that guerrillas live among the people the way fish live in the sea , so a new strategy was developed in the hope of catching the fish In drying up the sea  --  which is to say , by tearing the entire Vietnamese society to pieces and then putting it together again according to some plan that was being worked out in the think tanks in Washington . At that time , officials proudly announced that millions of Vietnamese had been pulled out of their homes in order to " deprive " the enemy of their support , and the official analysts spoke of " war-induced urbanization . " But in adopting this strategy based on the insights of Mao ' Tse-tung the Americans obliterated the very purpose for which they had been sent to Vietnam . The aim had been to save the society , and counter-insurgency had been the means to that end . Now this policy was reversed ; destroying the guerrillas became the aim , and destroying the society became the means . However , if the men in the field had some knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or pretended not to know , or refused to know . What all this meant was not that the military were doing things the wrong way , or that the " mix " of bombing and camp construction was unbalanced , or even that a sound policy had been corrupted by bungling or by berserk execution . What it meant was something touch harder for the officials and experts in Washington to accept ; namely , that the South Vietnam they had sent the troops to protect had been a hallucination , which had little resemblance to the actual country in which the men were fighting . In the last analysis , what the men were fighting to protect , and are still fighting to protect , was not a country but this hallucination . The truth is that the job that the politicians had assigned the military , the job of protecting the people of South Vietnam from a foreign enemy , was simply not there to he done . There was no such job . If you send someone to protect a friend from a common enemy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend is n't a friend after all and does n't want his help ? The answer is that he leaves . But this alternative was not open to our military . Having been sent to do a job that turned nut not to exist , our military men , who were forced , after all , to live and work in the real Vietnam , and nut in the imaginary one in the politicians ' heads , began to do something else . They began to make war against the people whom then were supposed to be saving but who did n't want to he saved . To be sure , this was not a job that anyone had explicitly ordered them to do , nor was it a job that served to advance any objective ever stated by our government , but it did have the reassuring advantage of being , in a sense , real . Now this war against the South Vietnamese people , based on willful offi-cial ignorance , and working at cross purposes with official policy , has got completely out of control . None of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , particularly in the north-ern provinces , and all the game plans have gone haywire . Instead of produc-ing a peaceful , prosperous , democratic society , they have produced massacres , a desolated landscape , and squalid de-tention camps . For six years , the " social engineers , " both in and out of uni-form , have been at work with their hot dogs and their napalm , their fertilizers and their crop poisons , trying to build public-relations utopias on the burned villages and the corpses of villagers , and the result has been a swamp of red tape and blood . And now , per-haps themselves dismayed and revolted by the monstrous re-sults of their experiments , the social engineers have come up with their " final solution " to the problem of the northern provinces  --  the deportation project . Like scientists whose experiment has failed , they have decided to get rid of the whole mess , so that they wo n't have to think about it anymore . However , the new " solu-tion " is not really new at all . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are trying to escape from the present debacle by recommitting the very errors that led to it , but on an even huger scale , by doing to whole prov-inces what they used to do to one vil-lage at a time  --  as though they thought that through the sheer grandiosity of their new plan they could escape re-sponsibility for the chaos and suffering they had already caused . If the plan goes into effect , it will signal the full official acceptance of a way of looking at the people of South Vietnam that has dominated our policy unofficially since the beginning of the war . In this view , the problem in South Vietnam is not the traditional village system , or flaws in the pacification program , or even the Vietcong or the North Vietnamese . The problem is the South Vietnamese themselves . Ordinarily , we regard people as having problems , but in Vietnam we regard them as being problems . Get rid of them  --  send them somewhere else  --  and you solve your problems . There will he no more starving , begging refugees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ massacres of villagers . Get rid of the whole civilian mess , with its crying children and their crying mothers , its old people and its babies , its pigs and its chickens , and its sly but intractable spirit of resistance and defiance , and at last the Army and the Air Force will have a clear field of fire for hundreds of miles , and will be able to start fighting the war the way a war should be fought . But fighting for what ? Bock to the Apollo WE have a report from a self-ap-pointed rock correspondent : " I decided last week that it was time to go back to the Apollo . The Apollo is on West 125th Street , in Harlem , in case you do n't know , and , except for the Radio City Music Hall , the Apollo is the only theatre in New York to he listed by Variety as a vaudeville house . Radio City has the Rockettes and the Christmas Pageant , but the Apollo has the best soul acts anywhere , and sometimes there is dancing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Apollo since I was fifteen  --  back in the fifties . When I was fifteen , I went to see Frankie Lyman and the Teenagers . I had their single ' Why Do Fools Fall in Love ? ' and I had an album with a picture of Frankie and the Teenagers looking very clean-cut in white sweaters . I still have that album , by the way . The white sweaters have a big ' T ' on the front , like a varsity letter , and the picture shows the group outdoors , in some healthy rural environment . Frankie and the Teenagers were lucky to get their pictures on the album cover at all . In the fifties , a lot of albums by black singers had anonymous covers ( two white bobby-soxers dancing in front of a jukebox , for instance ) , and if there was a picture of the group , it was small and on the hack . I had wanted to see Frankie in person . To see him , I took a train " The trouble is a trillion-dollar economy does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at 125th Street , and took a crosstown bus to the Apollo . I do n't remember what Frankie wore , but it was n't a white sweater . He was incredible . I was thrilled and frightened by bins , and by the atmosphere of the Apollo , which was not the atmosphere of a healthy rural environment . It was n't an ordinary thing for a white kid to go to the Apollo in the fifties , but it was n't out of the question , and I knew a lot of kids who , like me , made it a point to go once . I think this custom has died out . " The night I went back to the Apollo , Wilson Pickett was beading a bill that also included Brenda and the Tabulations . Wilson Pickett -- sometimes known as Wicked Wilson Pickett  --  is a crowd-pleaser , and , next to James Brown , is about the biggest man around , but he has been around for a sdai/ ? . I met a black friend at Frank 's Restaurant , near the Apollo , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guy selling ' Free Angela Davis ' buttons , and m3 friend took some abuse because he would n't but one : mil because he was going into the Apollo with the Master . ' " Ilse Apollo is different from the Fillmore or any hip-rock hall . The Fillmore , patronized by the children of the bourgeoisie , strives for ( and achieves ) a certain level of funkiness . The Apollo strives for ( and achieves ) a certain class . The stage of the Apollo is bathed in red light and is surrounded by eight Doric columns . The patrons of the Fillmore are all about the Same age , whereas whole families corm : to the Apollo . " There are two basic styles of performing you can see at the Apollo . There is the classic choreographed style , full of special gestures and quick turns , and there is the super-soul style , which demands a heavy response from the audience .

The night I was there , the first group on The Posse. , dressed in red-and-white jumpsuits  --  worked in the choreographed style . ' You and must make a pact , ' they sang , and their hands came together in an elaborate pact-making gesture . ' Jackson Five sound , with Temptations steps , ' my friend said , dismissing them . The next group  --  The Victories , also in jumpsuits also worked in the choreo-graphed style , and sang in the fifties falsetto manner of the Flamingoes . Between acts , Eddie CYJay , a Harlem disc jockey , worked with the audience . Madam , are your stockings white or are your Legs ashy ? ' he said . Then a girl named Laura Lee sang Wedlock Is a Padlock ' ( Wedlock is a padlock when you 're married to a no-good man ' ) and worked hard for a response from the audience . ' If you got a gond woman , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my hand ! ' she shouted , and she did get one guy to come up . ' Sure did mess that boy 's mind up ! ' said the man behind me . " ' Is it all right so far ? ' Eddie O'Jay asked , and the response was small . " Brenda and the Tabulations came on  --  three stunning girls in long white dresses  --  and sang their most important recorded number , ' Do n't Make Mc Over . ' Brenda has class . She got the response without asking for it . " Then Wicked Wilson Pickett came on in a black jumpsuit cut down to his waist , sang ' Funky Broadway , ' and began working for the super-soul response . ' Clap your hands , ' he said . ' Get up and do it . You can shake what you brought with you . Can I get one in this aisle ? ' He came down off the stage . He got the response , but it was work , and no one really did dance in the aisles . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I asked her where she had been playing . ' I was at Cheetah for twelve dats , ' she said .

I 've been on the road for five years , but I was green when I started . I was thirteen . It 's just beginning to happen for me .
