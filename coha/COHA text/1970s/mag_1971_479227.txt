THE BUBBLE OF THE NORTH burst last I fall . It was time . Canada had held out as an American fantasy long after honesty had set in elsewhere . Tranquil , harmonious , natural ; endless lakes-andwoods with barely a smudge of human society . Americans clung to the image : Canada was the haven , the place to go when repression in the U.S. got too heavy ; the place where race riots and civil wars do not occur ; where the hockey players are all the same color and the folk singers are apolitical ; no draft , no empire , no police state . " Friendly , Familiar , Foreign , &; Near , " said the ads in The New Yorker . And on the day the War Measures Act was proclaimed , a Canadian historian brought out a book called Canada : A Guide to the Peaceable Kingdom . " What the hell is happening up there ? " Americans want to know . Canadians are pained too . " Woe is us , " they wail . " We have lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , foreign . just a little fascist ? and Trudeau the leftish ex-swinger is the top gun in town . Agnew and Ian Smith speak warmly of the first Western country of the Seventies to invoke martial law in peacetime ? and young Americans wonder where they 'll split for now . The older Canadian image is a write-off , and some revisions are in order . I have been carrying out my own Canadian revisions of late . I wandered in the U.S. for ten years , morbidly infatuated and playing at rootlessness . But I have been returning to Canada lately , in a spasmodic way . First I tried French Canada , but that aborted . Last year I came back to English Canada . I am gathering clues about this country , and I want to pass them on to the gringos . You have to understand : About Quebec . We were fooled . We went to Expo in ' 67 and thought that Montreal was Disneyland North . But Rick Sal utin , twenty.eight years aid , is o Canadian journalist . He is currently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quebec has never been a very willing partner in the Canadian binational enterprise . When the troops moved in last fall . the kids called to each other , " Regardez les soldats d'Ottawa . " They knew they 'd been invaded . These days Quebec could become the Cuba of the North ? and Marines in Montreal are imaginable . About the real Canada-U.S. relationship . Canada is the foremost , biggest , and fattest colony in the current American Empire . The occupation is gentler , and the kickback more generous , but no banana republic is so totally dominated . That 4,000 miles of unfortified border , glorified to us in our schooldays , was the invitation to rape . As a colony , Quebec differs from the rest of the country only in being doubly colonized : by the U.S. and by English Canada . I DISCOVERED QUEBEC was another country when I went there in the fall of 1969 . It was my first attempt at repatriation and it was ass-backwards . I wanted to rejoin my country , but I had come to the wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plague than an English-Canadian . I could sit in the tavern and cheer on the Mets ? it was the autumn of their glory ? but never the Maple Leafs . After several burns I chose to pass as a New Yorker . It was no place for an English-Canadian to find himself . Quebec was alive with national sentiment , but it was Quebecois , not Canadian . They 'd progressed a hundred years over the past decade . In 1960 most people still went to confession and the schools were church-run . Now the schools are public , secular , and women take " le Pill . " People are reading Che , organizing a technocracy , and speculating on the value of Rimbaud for Quebec poetry . I was never more of an outsider . Although Quebec has never been politically independent , this national sense has survived for centuries . At times it has been kept alive with little more than a sullen stubbornness , strung out over generations . The British came in 1759 . After the conquest they reached an accommodation with the church and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in business . In 1837-38 they suppressed two rebellions , after which they attempted to submerge Quebec in English Canada and force English as the official language . The people of Quebec were not consulted about confederation in 1867 . ( And they were not the only French-Canadians who resented English dominance . The Riel Rebellion in the Canadian West was a war of resistance by French settlers and Indians against a racist policy of western settlement . i There were roaring conscription riots in Quebec during both world wars . Quebec was never enthusiastic about the causes of the British Empire . National resistance did not begin this fall . The Quebecois have clung fiercely to their language . It is a separate linguistic entity , as different from French as Irish is from English . It is hard for Americans to understand such commitment to a language because they have no language problem . But being deprived of your language is like being castrated . During those months in Quebec I knew no one English . 1 would lurch along for hours in French , wondering who the others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sometimes I would n't talk for days ; I would just sit in the bar and smile a lot . I would spend the night with a woman and , over coffee in the morning , reach for the dictionary to explain something . A point arrived when I would rather have talked than fucked ? had there been a choice . French-Canadian workers get up and eat breakfast in French and then go to the factory where they take their orders in English , because all the supervisors are English . They are jolted in and out of this hostile tongue every clay of their lives . They are the White Niggers of America , which is the title of their literary testament by Pierre Vallieres , who has spent most of the past five years in jail for his radical separatist beliefs . The national muting of Quebec is in some ways only the excuse for economic robbery . American corporations own about 60 per cent of the province 's industry ; English-Canadians , who make up only 17 per cent of the population , are the executives and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ base of Quebec 's social heap , and they do even more poorly than wage earners elsewhere in Canada . Quebec is notorious for unemployment and cheap labor . Unemployment right now is around 10 per cent , about twice that of the heartland of English Canada . This combination of economic and national grievances is political dynamite . The separatists are , for the most part , socialist revolutionaries . There is today a radical orientation among many French-Canadian workers that American Marxists only theorize about . For example . during October , construction workers ( ! ) served as bodyguards for prominent leftists . Every politician and businessman had his cop or his soldier , every revolutionary had his hard-hat . There is a respectable political party called the Parti Quebecois ( PQ ) pulling to keep up with the pace in a peaceful way . Its program is separatism with a touch of socialism . It offers a mild and unferocious electoral opposition in Quebec , but its first appearance in a provincial election in the spring of 1970 panicked the Canadian Establishment . Trudeau sent his personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for television appearances . Money poured in . Falsified statistics went around . A trust company ostentatiously transferred funds to Ontario ; its armored truck lumbered from Montreal to Toronto with TV crews in tow . Still and all , the PQ polled almost 25 per cent of the total vote , a stunning first run . Among French voters , it led all parties with about 30 per cent . But it only got 7 of 108 seats in the assembly , all of them . apropos , in working-class areas . The truth about Quebec has been fastidiously concealed . In 1967 , Montreal 's mayor , Jean Drapeau , and his council took care to line the route to Expo with billboards , so as to hide the city 's slums . They have a lot to cover up . ( Even Drapeau 's own elegant restaurant is shut now for nonpayment of rent . ) When the lid blew last October , I was unamazed . I knew that this was not just the Canadian version of last fall 's worldwide epidemic of terrorism , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in Toronto the night that the War Measures Act descended . All over Quebec the police and the Army went on a spree . The Act let them loose to raid and arrest without warrants , and hold without charging for ninety days . Prisoners got no lawyers , and no word went to their families . It became a crime , retroactively , to have belonged to the Front de Liberation de Quebec ( FLQ ) , a radical separatist group . This was strong stuff for the Peaceable Kingdom . I expected Toronto to explode . I knew what would happen in the U.S. if Nixon did something similar : the liberals would howl , schools would shut down . people would hit the streets . The Act was a far greater provocation than the Cambodian invasion , and I am a veteran of the Manhattan response to that . So I waited for the first mob to stream by . But nobody was marching . The silence was deafening . A vindictive passivity settled over English Canada . " After all . the Act was only being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the media were cowed ; they only interviewed cabinet ministers . I went to the University of Toronto where a crowd was gathered ? watching a soccer game . York University held a pro-government rally . I had culture shock at home . Far off in Quebec , the government assured us , a revolution was taking place . They had acted to prevent it . That was as much a fairy tale as the other Quebec stories we heard growing up . On October 5 , a cell of the FLQ kidnapped James Cross , British Trade Commissioner . They demanded release of twenty-three prisoners , a ransom , publication of their Manifesto , and rehiring of 450 truck drivers in Montreal who had been thrown out of work in the settlement of a postal strike . The police raided , the government stalled , and the FLQ began postponing deadlines . On October 8 , the government allowed an uninspired reading of the Manifesto over the French-language CBC . Trudeau apparently felt its " extreme " tone would alienate existing FLQ support . Far from it . This Manifesto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It names a lot of names , some real and some rhetorical , and compiles an impressive total of injustices . The Front de Liberation de Quebec is not the Messiah , nor a modern-day Robin Hood . It is a group of working people of Quebec who are committed to do everything they can for the people of Quebec to take their destiny in their hands .. .. We , like more and more Quebecois , have had our fill : of a government which performs a thousand and one acrobatics to charm U.S. millionaires .. . We live in a society of terrorized slaves , terrorized by the big bosses . Steinberg , Clark , Bronf man , Smith , Neapole , Timmins , GeoffF rion , J. L. Levesque , Hershorn , Thompson , Nesbitt , Desmaris , Kierans . ( Beside these , Drapeau , .. Bourassa ... Trudeau . . . are " peanuts . " ) .. . Terrorized by the capitalist Roman Church , even if this seems less and less obvious ( but who owns the Stock Exchange Tower ? ) .. . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what belongs to you ; take yourselves what is yours . You alone know your factories , your machines , your hotels , your universities ; do not wait for a miracle organ . ization . Numbers of people who had blanched at the FLQ 's actions now found themselves in sympathy with their grievances if not with their kidnapping tactics , but the government took a hard line . On October 10 , it announced there would be no negotiations . Instead of shuffling into the corner , the FLQ responded by grabbing Pierre Laporte , Quebec Labor Minister . Laporte , although a French-Canadian , was a vendu ? a sellout ? to the American corporations , according to the FLQ . Troops moved into Ottawa to protect officials . When a reporter asked Trudeau how far he was ready to go in suppressing civil liberties , he 28 replied , " Just watch me . " Meanwhile , pressure in Quebec was building against the hard line . Eight prominent Quebecois asked for negotiations . The FLQ was cheered at a mass meeting in Montreal . On October @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wealthy families . At 4:00 A.M. on October 16. the War Measures Act was proclaimed , following which , reported Justice Minister John Turner last January , there were 3,062 raids , 497 arrests , all without warrants , and only 62 charges made . On October 17 , Laporte 's body was found in the trunk of a car . In the next few weeks , the FLQ led Quebec 's " Keystone Kops " a merry chase . By November 6 , police prestige could sink no further . Then a suspect was found in a closet . He was sped to an inquest and immediately began to sing . For a week , the police regained some credibility , until an FLQ note announced that three other members of the cell were still in a secret compartment in the same closet . The first had gone out as a decoy . These survivors huddled and chuckled for twenty-two hours , while police scoured the apartment , unsuccessfully . Eventually , the police broke for coffee , leaving their guns in the apartment and locking the door from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sign of recent occupancy , took the guns , and left by the rear door . Police prestige sank to new depths . The cell members who held Cross eventually relinquished him at the Expo site , in return for safe conduct to Cuba . Laporte 's kidnappers were finally captured on December 22 and are now standing trial . The War Measures Act was replaced by the somewhat milder Public Order Act , which the government allowed to expire last April . Civil rights in French Canada took a terrible beating ; Quebec is said to be dickering with Polaroid for a national ID system ? second only to South Africa 's ? and the political trials are grinding on . W HY DID THE GOVERNMENT act so drastically ? Why did they impose the Act ? It was not : To save the hostages . The government was ready to sacrifice Cross and Laporte . Their posses raided incessantly ; they refused negotiations . The proclamation of the Act practically guaranteed Laporte 's death . To prevent a revolution . This possibility did not exist in 1970 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had composed a fantasy-laden revolutionary plan in an exam booklet and passed it on to a friend . ( " Each region would have one regional commander , 10 cell leaders , and 50 members , for a total of 61 ; 61 times 50 equals 3,050 in the province , plus 10 in the supreme council , equals 3.060 . Never one member more ... . " ) The jury had a good laugh and acquitted him of seditious libel . Because negotiations with kidnappers would have destroyed respect for law and order in Canada . The Brazilian government , not notable for coddling anarchists , has negotiated with kidnappers . So have Britain , West Germany , and Switzerland . No , the government was wholly determined to smash separatist and radical opposition of every sort in Quebec . If the FLQ had some success last fall , it was not because they had the guts to kidnap , but because they had the brains to use the situation to spread their message . Their Manifesto tapped wells of feeling , deep and wide . The government positions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showing poorly . The Quebec premier , Robert Bourassa , was a wan latecomer . During the crisis week , his top priority was to fly to New York to reassure Wall Street . Montreal Mayor Drapeau , a chronic hysteric at election times , was about to face his first real challenge ever from a Montreal civic coalition . So on came the War Measures . The kidnappings were the occasion , but the province-wide manifestation of discontent was the target . This is obvious from the arrests . They got everyone but the FLQ . They got journalists , students , labor leaders , PQ members , community organizers , doctors , a separatist chanteuse , and , incidentally , the daughter of Canada 's Secretary of State . Most of these people were separatists , but that was not illegal , even under the Act . A couple of Vietnamese students were arrested for deportation . Drapeau 's opposition was shattered . Two of its candidates , its treasurer , and its printer were jailed on various pretexts until just before the election . Most were questioned perfunctorily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of apartments were ransacked and furniture smashed . Private items were confiscated . All starting at four in the morning . This is the real stuff of terrorism , the random intimidation of a population . Whereas the FLQ had threatened only individuals in clear positions of power , when Trudeau said to the nation , " The kidnappers ' purposes could be served equally well by having in their grip you or me or perhaps some child , " he was indeed terrorizing the country . During this crisis , the real Pierre Elliott Trudeau finally stood up . Trudeau is only secondarily the swinger , the first politician of the McLuhan Age . Primarily he is the man who was selected , then elected , to do whatever was necessary to keep Quebec in . For Quebec is obviously going to be the Canadian issue of the Seventies . Trudeau ? bilingual , rich , assimilated , educated in London , Paris , and Harvard ? was deputized for it . He has shown himself to be the right choice . He is ready to do anything . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE TEN YEARS I lived in the U.S. , I was the compleat colonial come to the Mother Country . I walked the boulevards of New York and Boston and I soaked up the imperial culture . I thought I was cosmopolitan , but I was merely Americanized to the core . I was like one of those Africans in Paris who has journeyed to the center of his universe ? and sweeps the streets there . I had decided to get away for college , to escape the sleepwalk of adolescence and my parents ' house , but it never occurred to me to go away to a Canadian school . I was as determined to get out of the provinces as I was to vacate the family circle . I went off to Boston humming . " Oh Lord I 'm on My Way "  - -  a Jewish-Canadian Porgy bound for the Promised Land , and already singing its songs . I felt I was going to where the world was real .

Eventually America was in store for us all ? so why wait ? On my first day at college , I took a fateful step . I was on one of the registration lines , and someone asked me which line it was . " M to Z , " I replied , thereby chucking away one of the few fragments of a birthright Canadians bring with them to the States . ( Canadi ans say " Zed , " not " Zee . " ) And I remember , in the trivial instant before I answered , actually making a decision . I studied American literature , and I thought now here is literature : Melville , Hawthorne , Mark Twain , Walt Whitman . I remembered Canadian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who took their nation 's reality with a grand literary elan . I became involved in America 's perpetual identity crisis . I visited Concord , with its statue of the embattled farmer , all supple assurance and agrarian rectitude . I was feeling my first intimations of the force of national realities . Our national sense in English Canada had been so repressed I could never figure out why anyone cared . America had a history that was historic . Its civil war was prodigious : the armies were ugly , the battles were bloody , and the rhetoric was memo-rable . Canadian history , as we had learned it , was a timorous trip from colony to nation . Even the American vices were impressive : race war , Cold War , nuclear war ? and that was at the start of the Sixties , when things were still placid . In Canada , nothing seemed to be at stake . Parliament was debating designs for a Canadian flag . I was not a very exotic alien in the U.S. My ice skates were the only distinctive identity I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by talking about Canada . I developed a routine about my pseudo-country and its comical history . The years in New York increased the enervation and the de-Canadianization . Canadians often asked how I stood it there , but I divined a secret envy . They asked about the violence , and I said , to irk them , it was what I liked best . It was n't . What I liked best about New York was not going to sleep : the all-night groceries , bars , restaurants ; the Late Show , the Late Late Show . And there was something about the declared urban warfare of New York City that I preferred to Canada as I 'd known it . Canada protested her virginity too much . There did n't seem to be any raging social conflicts . If they existed , they were well-concealed , and that was unnerving . In New York your enemy was Everybody ? but at least you knew . I FINALLY RETURNED to Toronto in the spring of 1970 . The North Woods looked more like the sticks than they ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my best friends had become Canadian nationalists . I was appalled . I argued about it with Danny Drache . Twelve years ago , in high school , he was the treasurer of the interfrat ball and I was a teen-age existential theologian . Now he was a radical Canadian nationalist and I was embarrassed for him . " Look , Danny , " I explained , " nationalism is parochial anywhere , but especially in this farce of a country . " We even argued about the Americanization and repatriation of hockey . This was gauche . " Listen to this , " I said . " Ever since I 've been in the States , I 've been able to make people laugh by talking about Canada . This country is a joke . " " You are an idiot , " he said , " not a brilliant comic .

Just where you thought you were dashing you are outlandish ... , " I hear the ding of recognition . " What for ? " I asked . " Because it makes it easier to control the country . First the British ran Canada and now it 's the Americans . It 's much easier to milk a country when its people do n't care about it anyway . " He did n't claim there was a CIA plot called Canadian Putdown . Just that the American takeover is there , for any idiot to see ; so is the Canadian self-dismissal : and the latter does serve the former . This was true .

I was the most plausible outcome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's least restless natives , and I went an extra mile to worship at the Imperial Shrine itself . It was like a conversion . All the furniture of my former world had to be rearranged in the light of the Vision , I did not instantly turn superpatriot . But my Canadianism was so repressed that the main step was to 30 start taking Canada seriously . T IS NOT THAT THERE is a strong Amerlican influence in Canada ; it is that Canada is encrusted with America . The American presence in Canada is not what it is in , say , Cambodia , where the fleet of Pepsi trucks was the largest mobile force in the country and was commandeered to transport the Army . That is intrusive , like a germ , or a foreign body . But America does not intrude in Canada ; it supplants . It takes us for granted , elbows us out of the center , and leaves us only a little space at the edges . American corporations are not subtle invaders . They buy your country if you let them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bell for France when foreign ownership reached 10 per cent . The British are at 16 per cent and panicking . Foreign ownership or control of publicly-owned corporations in Canada is almost 60 per cent , but the Canadian govern . ment is carefree . This foreign control includes about 97 per cent of the automobile and rubber production , about 75 per cent of chemicals and electrical appliances , and about 60 per cent of all manufacturing . American corporations have more invested in Canada than they have in all of Latin America or Europe . These American multinational corporations are the great robber barons of our era . In Canada they have grabbed the hockey-stick makers and the funeral parlors , along with the mines , the forests , and the factories . Their Canadian subsidiaries export reluctantly so as not to compete with the parent companies . They buy and sell with the parent firms at rigged prices that are passed on to Canadians ; for example , a GM car made in Canada costs about 15 per cent more than the same model in the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outsiders , who are not interested in developing Canada : they only want to siphon off vast amounts of some resource or other . First it was fish , then furs , then timber . Now it is mineral and energy resources , which are about 75 per cent foreign-controlled . They ship these materials back to the Mother Country for processing , and then sell the finished goods back to Canadians , among others . Unemployment is chronic in certain areas , the economy is always lopsided , and Canada remains the world 's richest underdeveloped country . We grew up with a " myth " about the the need for U.S. capital in Canada . It is the bedtime story told to people in all underdeveloped countries . Once upon a time it had some truth . In the early part of the century , American capital was used to build up Canada 's economic foundations . But that time is long gone . These days the American corporations operating in Canada take only a pittance of their yearly costs I about 6 per cent ) from the U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expansion in Canada with money earned or borrowed right in Canada ? and there is enough left over to send back to the U.S. as profit ( $1.8 billion between 1960 and 1967 ) . We are exporting capital to them ? and this is as true of Latin America as it is of Canada . They are buying us out with our own money . The Waffle Group of the New Democratic party ( the Canadian equivalent of the British Labour party ) is one parliamentary faction that is struggling to combat the rising tide of United States takeover . Now the rush is on for Canadian energy resources . With 6 per cent of the world 's population , America today devours about half of the world 's energy . By 1980 it will be using around 80 per cent of the existing energy . American stores are very low , and much of the world 's supplies are unreliable in these troubled times . But the American corporations are counting on bargain rates and lifetime guarantees from Canadian politicians . So far , the heavy dealing is in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water . A Presidential commission estimated that by 1980 all U.S. water supplies would be polluted . A plan is in the works ? an American wet dream about Canada of staggering ambition ? called NAWAPA ( North America Water and Power Alliance ) . The idea is to dam up Canadian rivers and force them into an artificial reservoir 500 miles long in the Canadian Rockies . Senator Frank Church compares this plan to flood a foreign country to the Louisiana Purchase . Even ice hockey has been absorbed . Seven of the eight expansion cities are American . Canadians can not buy a franchise . Consequently , many Canadian hockey players are living rather ingrown expatriate lives in Oakland and L.A. Canadian TV salivates with Ed Sullivan , Bonanza , Ironside , and reruns of Star Trek . ( The last three happen to star Canadian expatriates . ) There is a Canadian Time and a Canadian Reader 's Digest : each carries some token Canadiana . They get a tax break from the federal government , which has helped them to blanket the native journalistic opposition . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Johnson personally intervened with Prime Ministers Diefenbaker and Pearson to maintain the tax exemption . American professors who come to Canada also get a form of tax break . They have thundered north and accomplished a takeover comparable only to the scope of their corporation compatriots . ( Only about 50 per cent of the teachers in Canadian universities are Canadian . while foreign professors in the U.S. comprise under 3 per cent . ) The outsiders bring their ideological baggage with them and send for their friends , although many Canadian academics are out of work . In 1969 , out of 2,642 new appointments in Canadian universities , only 362 went to Canadians . ( Although the outsiders do include English and other nationals , Americans make up the majority . At the University of Toronto , out of 106 graduate English courses , only one is in Canadian literature . At York University last fall ? the most fateful fall for French- and English-Canadians in a generation ? the race-relations course , taught by an American , focused on " a study of the American Negro , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem . " Later in the semester , the course noted " French-Canadians , Indians , and Jews , among others . " I sometimes fear I am becoming a fascist when I feel those sentiments in myself . Am I actually supporting a quota on American teachers in Canada ? A few in favor of a quota ? But the situation is grave . No other country has so debilitated itself and reduced its capacity for survival . Even the Canadian Left is obsessed with American models . For years it searched urgently for an equivalent to the civil-rights movement . It tried Canadian blacks and Canadian Indians . The only place it did n't look was Quebec . At a rally late last fall in Toronto to protest the War Measures Act , people chanted " Free Bobby Seale " while hundreds of Quebecois paced Canadian cells . Ten years ago , when nuclear disarmament was the cause , we argued about whether to march on Ottawa or Washington . One was the seat of our government but the other was the seat of our pants . Canadian foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cancelled a truck sale to China , because of the U.S. Trading with the Enemy Act , and Canadian Quakers could not buy drugs and medical supplies for North Vietnam . The Canadian recognition of China was undertaken with the reluctant approval of the U.S. , only after the Canadians had pointed out that the move could serve as a scouting mission for American diplomacy and business . The only politician we 've had in the past fifty years worth a damn in standing up to the Americans was poor anachronistic John Diefenbaker . He was an ass , and he , too , knew how to sell out , but in the crunch , he would not permit Canadian military policy to be dictated from the Potomac , and for that he was forced out with an assist from a U.S.-sponsored PR smear over the Bornarc missile issue . Lester Pearson was our boyhood hero because he won the Nobel Peace Prize , the Stanley Cup of international affairs . For twenty years he went up and down the country preaching internationalism , warning Canadians against nationalism because it caused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ II , and by " international , " Pearson meant pro-American . But no Canadian politician is so thoroughly Americanized as Trudeau . He was sold as the Canadian Kennedy and the country was buying . He is hip , commercial , and unprincipled . ( " pragmatic , " to use both his and Kennedy 's term for it ) . Trudeau is the final Canadian coming of Coca-Cola . But why bawl if Canadians choose to disappear ? Because it is not the Canadian people at large who have sold the country out . Any time they have had a choice , they have rejected integration with the U.S. ? by arms or with votes . Even today , when the Americanizers threaten an economic dive as the price of independence ? a threat that is economic garbage ? a Gallup I of Canada ) Poll showed most Canadians would accept lower standards of living rather than continued dependence on the U.S. The country was sold by a small group of businessmen and politicians , many of whom interchange frequently . They sold out for good profits and stayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new subsidiaries . They see little point to the alarms . " Canadian nationalism , " they say . " How old-fashioned can you get ! " Many Americans are down on nationalism because they think of flag decals and Agnew . It depressed me when I was there . I put a " Remember the Pueblo " bumper sticker on because I knew I 'd get fewer traffic tickets . But not all nationalism is idiot chauvinism . There is good nationalism and bad nationalism . A lot depends on whether your country is dumping or being dumped on . Canada is not pure victim . We have our leeches , though they tend to be in collusion with the Americans . There is even an imitative Canadian mini-imperialism in the Caribbean . Canada is somewhere in between the dumpers and the dumpees . But it is not the U.S. Canadian nationalism is anti-American , but not anti America-in-itself : it is anti America-in-Canada . Nor is it anti all Americans . It is anti those Americans who buy up and work over everything actually or possibly Canadian . Although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some spirited negativity is in order for Canada . The imperial U.S. presence is so stifling that the positive expressions will only come after resistance has cleared some space to work in . It is not necessary right now to say just what is or will be the content . What matters is whether the mass of Canadians want to remain Canadians , and there is growing evidence that they do . Only a few years ago there was relatively little opposition to the American takeover . Today it is the hottest item on the political market in English Canada . On my last border crossing ? always a Kafkaesque event ? the Mounties checked me very closely . ( They are our FBI . ) They were looking for tapes made by one of the FLQ cells during the kidnappings , and I happened to have some French-language tapes with me that dealt with the Quebec situation . The non-French-speaking Mounties and customs guards summoned the janitor and he translated for them . They were tough and repressive , but they knew what they were looking for and when they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go . But the American border officials turned me back out of general paranoia . They had nothing specific against me . One of them looked like J. Edgar Hoover and the other talked like Rod Steiger in In the Heat of the Night . " Boy , " he said , " I 'm going to deny you permission to come into our country . " I drove back across the Peace Bridge . I was stuck with Canada but ? it is not yet the U.S. Wake up , America ! One of your final dreams is fading .
