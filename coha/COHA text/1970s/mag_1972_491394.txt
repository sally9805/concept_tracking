Editor 's Note : Professional football is sport , big business , spectacle , community pride , and public mayhem all wrapped up in one stark drama which more Americans enjoy watching than any other activity . Perhaps we are addicted to it so because it is gigantic as well as violent . Pro football players are supermen , its rewards super colossal , its failures super abysmal . And , appropriately , its championship turf is the Super Bowl . And yet Roger Staubach , the super-est of all the superstars , the reigning hero in this saga of raw human conflict , is outstanding-except when he is on the field-for his normalcy . A mere 200 pounds and six-feet-three in a world of monsters , he is handsome , cleancut . God-fearing , and soft-spoken . Family man , charity worker , and businessman . Yet he is the quarterback and inspiration for that most fearsome and devastating football machine of them all , the World 's Champion Dallas Cowboys . What is it about him , you ask , that makes him tick ? Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ described as every mother 's dream of the boy her daughter will marry , as a dashing young Hollywood actor whose name you ca n't quite recall . At home , as you watch him gently and quietly discussing with his youngest daughter Stephanie Marie , three ( his older daughters are Jennifer , six , and Michelle , four ) , the obligations anent her overturning a glass of lemonade at the family lunch table , he seems better cast than scrambling across a gridiron pursued by a thundering herd of musclemen-onthe-hoof bent on grinding him into the turf . Yet as a junior at Annapolis he was on everyone 's All-American list and won both the Heisman and Maxwell trophies , given annually to the nation 's best college player . Last year he led the Cowboys to a smashing 24-8 triumph over the Miami Dolphins in the Super Bowl , was named the most valuable player in the same game , and won the Berl Bell award as the outstanding player in the National Football League . The most striking thing about Roger , after you have recovered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whether signing autographs for a group of youngsters , or moving back , back , back on the gridiron until he unleashes his downfield pass even as the tacklers are felling him , his self-control is almost something apart from him -a discipline he applies to himself as if he were two separate people . Part of this stems from his religion . God is real to Roger Staubach , and has been since he was a boy in Cincinnati . And perhaps this helps him put his best effort into everything he does , as well as maintain a sense of proportion as to his proper place in the world . He needs a secretary to answer his fan mail . He turns heads in Dallas just by driving down the streets . Girls turn electric at the mention of his name , and young men mutter reverently in their beards . Even Coach Tom Landry of the Cowboys , a man with a reputation for deadpan seriousness , breaks into a wide smile atthe mention of Staubach . The other side of the same coin is Roger 's sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Navy team was winning so many games because there were so many Catholics on the varsity , but that he had to abandon the theory after the Middies were walloped by Southern Methodist . On another occasion , conscious that there was a quip going the rounds about his scrambling and unexpected play calling- " nobody knows what he 's going to do except Staubach and God " Staubach whittled down this type of flattery by remarking at a banquet after the Navy loss to Texas : " After the way Scott Appleton rushed me in the Cot ton Bowl , I think you could say that only God , Stau- bach . and Scott Appleton know what I am going to do . " At the U.S. Naval Academy , where they called him " Jolly , " Staubach showed early signs that he did n't consider himself any better than the others . One time he tossed a water bomb into a room where a couple of his lessfamous teammates were study- ing , then beat a strategic retreat . One of the men grabbed a glass of water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " in his raincoat . You can imagine how many colleges bid for Staubach , the Frank Merriwell from Cincinnati , straight out of a Wheat ies ad . Then he picked Annapolis : " 1 decided I wanted to do something else in life besides play football . " That 's also why , after graduating in 1965 , he stayed in for his four-year hitch in the Navy-including a tour of duty in Viet nam . But when he returned to his job on the Cowboys , who had drafted him , Staubach did not delude himself either . " In pro football there is no substitute for winning ; everything centers around it . I 'd do anything to win other than cheat . But I do n't say this is a good philosophy for all of life or for all of sports . For example , I do n't think a Little Leaguer should think it 's the end of the world because he 's lost . " 52 THE SIITURDRY EVENING POST Fall 1972 It is this kind of mental balance , of convictions thought out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young man with exceptional athletic gifts . His schooling at Annapolis , his experience as an officer , were well chosen as a training ground for the leadership and managerial bent he must have on tap constantly as the Cowboys ' quarterback . As such he is the very model of a modern football player . a combination of alert thinking and physical skills honed to an uncanny edge . You know of his success as a pro footballer : yet you get the impression from his personality , as his Annapolis Yearbook , the 1965 Lucky Bag , predicted , that he will succeed in practically anything he sets out to do . Roger 's " office " is at home , a man 's domain of big leather chairs and football books . ( The Heisman trophy is out in front of the living room fireplace . but otherwise the house is not noticeably given over to the display of the many prizes and trophies pro football 's Galahad has amassed . ) He has just listened gravely , without any change of expression , to his daughters ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " a musical epic describing his derring-do in the Super Bowl . And you should see these girls ; every time his name is mentioned their eyes dance . Now he performs what is obviously a pleasant official duty - he kisses each of them before their afternoon nap . The pixies vanish , and the talk settles down to football . His eyes are steady as gunsights now : the fact is. every minute , every second , Roger Staubach is The Quarterback . This is a young man at the top . Perhaps no one has ever evaluated Staubach more succinctly than did Wayne Hardin , Roger 's coach at Navy : " There have been players who could pass better , some who could run better , some who could call plays better . But there was never anyone who had it all in one body better than Roger . I 've watched V.A . Tittle and Johnny Unitas , but Roger Staubach is the greatest football player I have ever seen . " It was a long road before I faced the defenses of the Dolphins last year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signed a contract the year before graduated that if I left the service I would play for the Dallas Cowboys . The reason I signed this contract was that I was drafted by both Kansas City and Dallas and I just wanted to let them know that if I decided to play professional football and they were both interested in knowing , that I would play for the Cowboys . So I spent four years in the service knowing that l would play for the Cowboysand therefore must stay in shape . My last year before I got out of the Navy , I was stationed at Pensacola . I was then in pretty good shape and had the chance to go to the Dallas Cowboys ' training camp for two weeks . I had a good two weeks there , and the following season I played football with Pensacola and that was more conditioning . I guess it was after that stint at the Cowboys ' training camp that I definitely made up my mind that i would play professional football . One year from that day at that training @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reported to Dallas on July 10 . I knew , of course , that people were saying that being away and the layoff would be a factor in getting back in with the Cowboys , but each of us is different . You reach a point of physical ability and you are not going to go beyond that . I knew that the main factor in my case was my ability to keep in shape and to hold the peak I had reached . My legs were alright . There was no reason for any particular worry otherwise . Once I got out I knew could compete , and as long as I could compete physically I was n't worried ; I knew that it would work out . Waiting it out as a twenty-seven-year-old rookie on the Cowboy bench turned out to be more frustrating than I had ever expected . I did n't want to believe it . It was more of a shock than I thought it possibly could be . When I got to the Cowboys there was just no thought of me playing . Coach Landry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they just were n't ready for me to play football . I ended up being lucky with the Cowboys just by staying as a backup man as a second-string quarterback . But very much a rookie . What happened was that Don Meredith was the regular Cowboy quarterback , and behind him they had Craig Morton and Jerry Rhome , both my age , to back him up . But in this situation , they traded away Rhome , and then Meredith retired . So there was just Morton and myself left . Coach Landry believed in me enough that he did not trade one of our other better players for some other , experienced quarter . back . I really do n't think he wanted me , a rookie , to be his backup man , but the circumstances had it that I would be just that and he stuck with me . The truth is that I came into a championship-type of football team . Now if l were a rookie with another team I 'm sure I would have had a shot within the first year . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much on their quarterbacks that it is almost impossible for a rookie to break in for a long time , when so much is at stake . Coach Landry could very easily have gone entirely with the more experienced man , and then I would really have been shocked . I do n't know what I would have done . But Morton was hurt in the exhibition season and I started the first game of the season , my rookie year . against the St. Louis Cardinals . Our first regular season game and I played the whole game as quarterback ! The Cowboys won 24 to 3 . It was a tremendous game for me and an exciting one . But right afterwards , once again I was the rookie quarterback . That was my first game as a regular and that also was my last starting game . I played only sparingly during that year as a backup quarterback . But at least I did start in that first game . In those early days my scrambling caused a lot of comment . But the fact was that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in control of the situation and when I did have control I ran . Coach Landry has seen me develop over the last few years and he has seen me continue to use the running option . But I use it now more out of necessity . I think running is going to be part of my game all the time as long as I stay healthy and can run . Now I use it as a weapon , instead of just a way out of a bad situation . In a certain sense , winning the Heisman Trophy can be a handicap later on in the pro league . It 's quite a burden of recognition for just a rookie to carry . In my own case , if I had just come in as a rookie , it might have been a factor . I think that if I had come right out of college as a Heisman Trophy winner , it would have been somewhat different than it turned out for me . But I graduated in ' 65 and I played before with some of the Cowboys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Morton , Walker , and Rentzel and I had all played together in the college All-Star game in Chicago . So I got to know them there , plus 1 had come to training camp the year before , plus I was older and knew a lot of the other veteran players . So they treated me pretty well . They were probably more lenient and more understanding of me as a rookie than of some other rookies . I did n't have a bad time at all . They were fine to me . But the main thing on my mind , of course , was that as a professional football player , I just wanted to play . That was the primary thing . In our system , Coach Landry sets up a firm game plan and regularly sends in plays to the quarterback . I have an option on the field at the line of scrimmage . I can change the play at that point and call an audible if the defense looks as though they 're ready for our set play . This is an area that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Landry continues calling the plays , I will probably use the audible more , with experience . Last year I averaged four or five audibles a game . There were also times when I decided to come over to the sidelines and we talked about situations and plays , and decided what plays I could use better than others . We had practiced all of them during the week , so we were on the same wavelength there . Last year the game was the way he wanted it and he will probably continue that way until he feels that I can take over with added experience . We have reached the point now where the Cowboys have won ten games in a row , but you ca n't say it was due to this or due to that . You do n't change a winning pattern . Who knows what would have happened if it were 1 who called the plays ? It is hard to judge , but I think we have a winning formula now and I 'm sure Coach Landry will continue it . I will probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I called them last exhibition season , a whole game at a time , and we moved the football . Craig did too , and we were 6 and 0 . We have a winning situation right Continued on page 128 now and I 'm certainly not going to argue with it . The fact of Landry calling the plays could be called security , in a sense . But it is not something I am seeking . Landry is a brilliant coach and the thing is if you want someone to call plays for you you 'd prefer him . By instinct , I like to do some things against the grain , gambling type of things , that he probably would n't ordinarily call from the bench . I have a tendency to act more on my own and not rely on someone else in any given situation . I think it is an important function of a quarterback to call plays and I have the intelligence to do that and at the same time control my own against-t he-grain characteristics . But we have a winning combination right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are . If 1 were to call all of the plays , it might not be as balanced an attack as we have now . Landry 's strategy stabilizes us . In our attack we may sometimes have more actual plays than the other team . Now a lot of teams may have the same number of actual plays that we have  --  but we can run those plays from a wide variety of formations . This requires that you have the knowledge and a complete feel for the play to put a certain formation together . We try not to overdo the offensive variety . We limit the different formations on a given play from game to game , That way we can change around from week to week with the same basic plays and give the team a different look each week . Back there in the pocket , a quarterback is just thankful that he has a lot of guys up in front blocking . With the Cowboys , of course , 1 am surrounded by a very good football team . I think there are a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The only way we quarterbacks could be really compared would be to put us on a team that is the least successful and see who could win the most games . 1would like to compete that way . That is just part of the game , those guys coming at you . When you 're in the open field and those linebackers are after you , then it gets a little bit hairy , because those guys are fast  --  so those are the ones I really keep my eye out for when I 'm running . As far as staying in the pocket , and maybe getting hit , those are just the hazards of the trade . Passing , of course , is the big weapon , and I could just sit back and throw the ball 70 yards for fun , but in a game you do n't have time to throw the ball that far for one thing . I like the medium-type passes , sideline passes . By the time I throw the ball it will be in the air about 30 yards , but only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Of course , I like to throw the deep pass too . It is the type of pass you have to work on a lot and with all the zone defenses you do n't get a chance to throw it that much . But in practice I do like to just lay the ball up front . You can always see the guys you are passing to . You may lose sight on the deep passes , momentarily , but you can always find your receiver if you look . In terms of general management , say , as compared to baseball , I think the league is well run overall . It is a give-and-take affair . The decisions that are made in the next few years between professional football teams and owners are going to be critical . Anytime there is big money involved in the game , greed gets the best of people . I think everyone has to understand the situation . This is a problem area that is very critical right now . Every time publicity comes out in the paper it is not always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyway , as opposed to the facts . What is in the paper the public sees . They do n't know if it is right or not ; it 's just what they read . Pro football is just getting so big , but you know it still has to be a game . Greed will kill you . In my case , Ithink I have signed a fair contract . It is tough to judge the relationships between owners and players . You reach a point of where fair is fair and then you have to live with it . Looking at it from a quarterback 's eyes  --  if we do n't move the football this season I 'm going to be responsible , but when we are successful and win a Super Bowl , the quarterback gets the glory . And the money . Chuck Howley , Mel Renfro  --  I 'll bet these guys have n't had a chance , in the off season , to make much money except on speaking deals , and these guys are old pros . So here I am hitting every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I look at quarterback as a more rewarding position . These other guys have been tremendous athletes for years and yet when they get in to talk about contracts it just is extra critical for them . This off season I have had speaking engagements all over . I could be speaking every day , twice a day , as far as requests have come in . The toughest thing for me this off season has been to program my time and energies . I have made some very good money , but I have also given over a tot of my time for free to causes I believe in , youth groups and things . My biggest thing is Fellowship for Christian Athletics . I 'm very active in that . I have been involved only sparingly in the FCA until now . 1 started in the Naval Academy , and then continued in the service . Since I have been with the Cowboys , I have been more active . I have found the need to use my time not just for myself or trying to make money . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important to me that my time should be used not just for myself and not just for my family . This is one of the areas that I have tried to give some money and time to . FCA is an organization that is involved with young people . It also has adult chapters but it is mainly high school huddle groups . It has seventeen national conferences and I am going to head up one at the Naval Academy for six days . It is going to be recreational , plus physical and spiritual and learning how to be a young man with a belief in God and his son Jesus Christ . The FCA feels that they can communicate this concept through professional college and high school athletics . The FCA has been criticized for using only athletes , but we feel that it is just the way that you can really get to the kids . You ca n't just be all-encompassing . It is only a vehicle . I have seen some great results with young high school kids . Their lives have been changed through FCA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heart of the FCA . They will be freshmen through seniors in high school mainly . Continued on page 130 The drug problem is one of ? the big ones . I am not experienced , or a professional , in this area . I have never tried drugs , only normal medical needs . I have been involved to some extent as co-chairman of Operation Reach , a drug program of the Boy Scouts . I personally feel it is a very powerful drug program . It is not a scare campaign . It gets into the values to put into your life instead of reaching for drugs . It is a communication between parent and student , and student and student . The concept is that if you can communicate you have understanding between you and your family or between you and a friend . This way , when you have a void or depression in your life , you have something more important going for you than trying drugs . I think it is a tremendous program , reaching for other values instead of drugs . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the tragic living ruins that go along with drugs . I believe that if a young man or young woman is living for something beyond today and living for the love of God , they will have something greater than drugs on their minds and build up a very strong resistance to drugs . I am often asked my thoughts on how racial prejudice is affecting pro football . The old myths that I encountered growing up , not in my family but all around me outside , are being destroyed today . The blacks are proving to be very courageous and strong , and if given the opportunity , they have proved that they are equal in any field . I think in many cases the opportunities are still not completely equal the way they should be , but at least in athletics they are more so than in any other area . With that wedge to get him in the door , the black athlete has the chance to show how good he is . There is no difference ; we are all human beings . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in just the last 100 years . It would be wise to put ourselves in someone else 's shoes before we judgethem . We have to make some type of change . We have to realize that there might be some educational barriers but with opportunity the black is no different than we are . In turn the black people have to realize that white people have to be changed ; we have to show them and prove to them that there is a basic acceptance . There should be no boundaries when you say you are not prejudiced . Each man and woman should be given an equal opportunity . In athletics , I think , it is being shown what can happen when the boundaries are down and that these old racial myths are not true . As to the future , in the personal sense , I have n't quite come to any firm decisions on that as yet . I have been in business in the off-season periods , and I try to do my own investing . ! even act as my own agent in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Dallas for three years , strictly off season . I am also involved with a company that manufactures familyorientated games and hobbies ; this has been more than just the athletic promotion idea . They are a good company . I am part of their staff and I owe them a lot of my time and I like it very much . The type of business people that I have met through the company have been very good . Between this and working out , my off season has just been completely full . I 'm just not sure what I want to do when my football years are over , although I do like this commercial real estate . I will just have to wait and see . I enjoy football very much . I enjoy competition and if I stay healthy I hope to play another seven or eight years . If a quarterback stays in shape and does n't take too many beatings , he can last . This is only my third season , going into my fourth year , so I have n't taken all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fourteen-year period . So I feel that if I 'm not injured seriously , I can still be very effective at the age of thirty-five .
