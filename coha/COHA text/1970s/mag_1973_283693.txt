President Nixon 's unprecedented disclosure of his personal financial records early this month has not allayed the suspicion that he has reaped unwarranted gain while in office . Last week new controversies erupted : <P> - Former Internal Revenue Service Commissioner Sheldon Cohen , a Democrat , said that the President apparently violated IRS rules by improperly listing his $50,000 annual expense account as additional salary . Counted that way , and not as an expense allowance , the sum increased not only Nixon 's adjusted gross income but also the size of the maximum tax deduction he could take for charitable contributions . Tax laws limit the maximum charitable deduction to a fixed percentage of adjusted gross income . In three of the four years affecting Nixon 's recent tax returns , he would be allowed charitable deductions up to 50% of that income . Thus the larger Nixon 's adjusted gross income , the more quickly he could claim as a deduction all the $576,000 valuation placed on the vice-presidential papers that he donated to the National Archives . An accountant commissioned by the Washington Post @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saved $13,000 in taxes ( an amount equal to 17% of the $78,651 that he actually paid ) . <P> - There was new criticism of the Government-paid improvements on Nixon 's homes at Key Biscayne , Fla. , and San Clemente , Calif . Last week the General Accounting Office , the congressional watchdog agency that monitors spending , charged that some of the $1.4 million spent at the two residences increased the value of the property but did little to protect the President . GAO officials maintain that Nixon should personally have borne at least part of the nearly $24,000 for landscape maintenance , $19,300 for building a private railroad crossing and cabana , $8,400 for property surveys , $10,600 for driveway paving and $3,800 for a new sewer line . <P> Above all , politicians , tax lawyers and historians continued to question the propriety-if not the legality-of Nixon 's claiming a big tax break for donating his vice-presidential papers to the National Archives . The papers had been prepared or gathered while he was on the public payroll , primarily using public facilities and the services of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ papers might seem to contain a lode of trivia . Occupying 825 cu . ft , they include 414,000 letters , 87,000 items relating to public appearances ( including speech texts ) , 27,000 invitations ( along with acceptances and refusals ) and 57,000 items relating to foreign trips . Nonetheless , this material could well be valuable to historians who one day will attempt to piece together a profile of America in the 1950s . <P> F. Gerald Ham , president of the Society of American Archivists , insists : " I think it is a fiction that these are private papers . The very great bulk of these papers originate from one activity only - that of serving in a public capacity . I think they should be public papers . " A 1969 study for the American Historical Association put the case even more strongly . The association said that the concept that a President 's papers became his property after leaving office was " a lingering vestige of the attributes of monarchy , not an appropriate or compatible concept ... for the head of a democratic state . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
