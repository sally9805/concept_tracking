 | Poison Roams Our Coastal Seas In the past few years there has been considerable scientific concern about chemical residues in fish , but almost all investigations have been limited to freshwater lakes and streams . Yet some species of coastal fish have gone into what John R. Clark , curator of the New York Aquarium , describes as " a disastrous decline , a virtual wipeout . The total commercial catch on the Middle Atlantic in 1969 was down to about onetenth of the 1960 catch . The multimilliondollar menhaden fishery was nearly eliminated in the late ' 6Os , and weakfish , croaker , spot , porgy and fluke are close to disappearing in the Northeast . Pollution is a major cause . Coastal waters are infested with pesticides , metals and other toxic pollutants , and these poisons can kill fish , their young and the organisms they feed on . " It is also possible that this pollution , unless checked , may kill people . A study sponsored by SPORTS I LLUSTR ATED re ' that poisonous chemical compounds = the flesh and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sport fishes have reached levels that are alarming health authorities and fishery biology . The study , the first ever to involve f es from the Atlantic , Gulf and Pa : coasts of the U.S. , was . conducted this magazine by WARF Institute , Inc. @#  | in Madison , Wis. , a highly respected laboratory that has done research for the Federal Government , various states and private industry . Specifically , the study shows that the flesh of spotted seatrout from Louisiana , striped bass from California and Spanish mackerel from South Carolina contains more mercury than allowed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in fish sold for human consumption . Other tests disclose that the reproductive process of at least four different fish populations may be threatened by high residue levels of chlorinated hydrocarbon pesticides in the eggs . High levels of DDT residues ( a combination of DDT , DDD and DDE ) are in the eggs of striped bass from California , from the Hudson River , New York , from the Rappahannock River , Virginia , and in the eggs of bluefish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the eggs of the California and New York bass have high PCB residues , an industrial compound that has escaped , into the environment by accident . The fish studied were all females close to spawning and were collected last spring and summer byr fishermen , biologists and two state fish-and-game departments . The sampling of each species from a given location generally in-  | eluded from five to 15 individual fish . All samples were wrapped in aluminum foil , frozen and shipped by air in containers with dry ice to WARF in Madison where Francis Coon , head of the chemical department , supervised the analyses . A complete list of fish species , location taken , residue data and analytical methods employed in the study is shown below . In recent months there has been public clamor about mercury residues in fish , residues sufficiently high to close or restrict fishing in such famous bodies of freshwater as Lake Champlain between Vermont and New York ; the Lake St. Francis section of the St. Lawrence River between Quebec and Ontario ; the Niagara and Oswego rivers and lakes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in New Hampshire ; the Savannah River and Brunswick Estuary in Georgia ; Mobile Bay and the lower Mobile River , the Tombigbee River and the Pickwick Lake section of the Tennessee River in Alabama ; the Detroit River and Lake St. Clair in Michigan ; and the Wisconsin River from its juncture with the Mississippi River to Rhinelander , Wis . In fact , mercury pollution is a problem in at least 33 states and eight Canadian provinces . Mercury pollution of fish , shellfish and birds was first discovered in Japan and Sweden in the 1960s . The pollution came from pulp mills , plastic and chlor-alkali plants and mercury-coated seeds . Despite warnings of mercury contamination elsewhere in the world , nothing was done in North America until last year when Norvald Fimreite , a Norwegian graduate student at the University of Western Ontario , tested pheasants from Alberta . The residues were so high that Alberta closed the hunting season . Still Canadian and U.S. authorities did nothing to try to halt the poisoning . Fimreite then found high mercury residues in fish from Lake St. Clair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chemical Company plant at Sarnia , Ontario , which was dumping as much as 200 pounds of mercury a day into the St. Clair River . Subsequent investigations elsewhere have uncovered other pollut- ers . One reason that authorities were slow to act was that everyone apparently believed mercury was too valuable to be thrown away . Another reason was that most authorities mistakenly believed that any mercury released to a waterway would sink to the bottom and be inert . However , Swedish scientists discovered that no matter what form of mercury is discharged to the environment , be it inorganic divalent mercury , phenyl mercury or alkoxy-alkyl mercury , it can be eventually converted by either microorganisms or fish into the most toxic form ? methyl mercury . As a trace element , mercury is found naturally in minute amounts in man . According to Dr. Henry A. Schroeder of the Trace Element Laboratory of Dartmouth Medical School , the human body contains about 0.2 parts per lion of mercury . ( Chemical residues are measured by scientists on parts per million and parts per million basis ; in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ppm , is the equivalent of one ou of vermouth in 7,812 gallons of gin the ultimate dry martini . ) The dan to man from eating mercury-contaminated fish or birds comes from raise levels in the body . The World Health Organization has recommended that no @# @#  | human food contain any trace whatsoever mercury , while Japan and Sweden , countries with strong commercial fishing interests , have set a standard of : : , pm . In Sweden scientists have criti ' this maximum as excessive , and one continent toxicologist has said that the : mum should be lowered to 0.2 ppm . Swedish government has stuck by 1.0-ppm standard but recommended t consumption of fish be limited to one I a week . In the U.S. the Food and g Administration maximum in fish is 0.5 ppm . The human tolerance level of mercury is not precisely known . From 1953 to 1960 , 121 persons in Minamata , Japan were killed or severely disabled as the result of eating mercury-contaminated shellfish from Minamata Bay . The mercury levels in the shellfish averaged 20 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bay over a period of years by a plastics plant . In the U.S. three members of the Huckleby family in Alamogordo , N. Mex. suffered severe brain damage after eating a hog that had been fed grain treated with mercury . Symptoms of mercury poisoning may occur weeks to months after exposure . The symptoms include a numbness and tingling sensation in the hands and feet , disturbed speech , inability to coordinate muscle movement , impaired vision and hearing and emotional disturbances . The 19th century expression " as mad as a hatter " came from cases of insanity suffered by hatters who inhaled vapors of mercury that was used to cure felt . In severe cases the symptoms of mercury poisoning are irreversible . A report submitted by an international committee in Stockholm last year stated : " In infants born to mothers with large amounts of methyl mercury , the symptoms are somewhat different . Most children had mental retardation and also cerebral palsy with convulsions. " c @#  | The highest mercury residues found in the SI study were in the flesh of spotted seatrout from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by WARF Institute revealed 2.2 ppm of mercury , four times more than the FDA maximum of 0.5 . In a repeat analysis by WARF , the level was 1.8 ppm . The seatrout were procured from a commercial fish company in Hackberry , and they had been caught in adjacent Lake Calcasieu , a brackish body of water connected to the Gulf of Mexico . On the Gulf coast , seatrout are generally not migratory but localized in one estuary . Last July after SI obtained the fish , the FDA , in an entirely unrelated move , halted interstate shipments of crabs , spotted seatrout , redfish and flounder from Lake Calcasieu because of high mercury levels . The flesh of striped bass from California also surpassed the FDA limit on mercury . The California Department of Fish and Game took the flesh and eggs from 15 different females caught in the Delta near Antioch , composited flesh and egg samples separately and forwarded them to WARF Institute . The department retained the remainder of the flesh and eggs for testing on its own . At WARF Institute initial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 0.68 . In order to obtain California striped bass for testing , SI agreed to allow the California Department of Fish and Game to review the results before publication and then to comment upon the significance . After reviewing the data , L. H. Cloyd , deputy director of the department , says that the WARF finding " for the level of mercury was consistent with one of our state laboratory reports . " Cloyd also points out the levels of mercury in stripers , as well as in some catfish , sturgeon ? and pheasants ? have prompted our governor to assemble a special task force of state agencies and cooperating federal agencies to investigate mercury pollution in California . " Mercury in excess of the FDA limit of 0.5 was also found in the flesh of Spanish mackerel caught four miles off Charleston , S.C . Initial analysis by WARF Institute was 0.57 in the flesh ; the repeat analysis was 0.56 . The Spanish mackerel is a pelagic fish , one that spends its life near the surface of the ocean and is not known to frequent shallow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carolinas and Florida , and it may migrate into the Gulf of Mexico . Other species had mercury levels close to the FDA maximum . False albacore from South Carolina , another pelagic fish , had residues of 0.40 in the flesh ; spotted seatrout from Shell Point Reef on the panhandle of the Florida Gulf coast had 0.40 ; striped bass from the Hudson River , 0.34 ; bluefish from South Carolina , 0.31 ; and white perch from the James River , Virginia , 0.31 . Little is known about the natural or normal mercury level in the flesh offish , but it is probably not more than 300 parts per billion . The lowest level discovered by WARF Institute was 0.10 parts per million found in the flesh of Atlantic mackerel from Long Island Sound , American shad from the James River and spotted seatrout from South Carolina . SI did not ask WARF Institute to analyze eggs for mercury residues . The WARF Institute analyzed the egg and flesh samples for DDT residues , dieldrin and BHC , all chlorinated hydrocarbon pesticides. ' these synthetic compounds have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down in nature ; indeed , it takes at least a decade for them to lose their toxicity . They are also highly poisonous to a broad spectrum of living organisms . They are used to attack insect pests because they can penetrate the external shell of chitin , a thin layer of hard fatty material that covers an insect body . Once applied , be it on insects , on the ground , on s tation or in the air , these long-living ticides are spread by wind and w Aerial applications of DDT can the atmosphere and circle the earth only two weeks . Last year Drs . Eu F. Corcoran and Douglas B. Seba the University of Miami reported face slicks containing pesticides was into Biscayne Bay after heavy ra These areas were several miles long from five to 300 feet wide , and they contained 10,000 times more chlorin .. hydrocarbon pesticides than the vN .. surrounding them . Once introduced into the food we chlorinated hydrocarbons are able move up from phytoplankton to zooplankton to fish to bird or manure and they become more and more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level of animals . The chlorinated drocarbons tend to center in the fats , such as those in the reproductive organs , and it is generally agreed that these chemicals are to blame for the current decline in North America of the brown pelican , the peregrine falcon and the bald eagle , our national symbol . A : l have fish in their food web . In the past two years the FDA has seized shipments of coho salmon from Lake Michigan and jack mackerel from the Pacific near Los Angeles for exceeding 5.0 ppm of DDT residues , and the U.S. Bureau of Sport Fisheries and Wildlife has noted DDT levels of from 31 to 45 ppm in the flesh of white perch taken from the Delaware River at Camden , N.J. Last month John MacGregor of the U.S. Bureau of Commercial Fisheries announced that a federal stud ' . of fish from Santa Monica Bay contained @#  | new research information . The showed DDT residues in those - be astronomically high , ranging fn ppm in the liver of Dover sole to 1 ppm in the liver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age plants emptying into the bay . City of Los Angeles plant at Hy was releasing one to seven pounds DDT components per day , while the Angeles County White Point plant daily discharging from 200 to 400 po of DDT residues . However , none of flesh samples tested for SI by WARF institute approached the federal maxim DDT residues were detected in the . of every species submitted , but the e ' est to the FDA maximum were the H son River striped bass that had D residues totaling 2.42 ppm . The WARF Institute also tested eggs for chlorinated hydrocarbon idues . Inasmuch as these pesticides ha an affinity for fat , it came as no s prise that there were higher residues the eggs than in the flesh . DDT idues in the eggs can affect reproducti or the survival of young fish . In Jas National Park , Canada there was a 70 mortality of brook-trout fry hatch from eggs with 0.46 ppm of DDT residues .

Gulf Breeze , Fla. reports that in a join : study with the Texas Department of Parks and Wildlife virtually no young spotted seatrout were observed in the Laguna Madre in ' 1968 and 1969 . The gonads of females had DDT residues up to 8.0 ppm . Different species of fish seem to have different levels of tolerance to DDT residues in the eggs . Precise levels are simply not known for most marine fish . but based on the above 0.5 ppm seems to be cause for concern and 1.5 ppm se-@# ' Dag continued @# - ious cause for concern about survival of the young . According to WARF In'titute results , the highest DDT residues in eggs were in the California striped bass , 9.05 ppm .

" Striped bass from the Hudson , which migrate to New Jersey , New York and Connecticut coastal waters , had 7.40 ppm of DDT residues in the eggs . They also had 0.33 ppm of dieldrin . By FDA standards , the eggs of these striped bass should not be eaten . Dieldrin is more toxic than DDT , and the FDA has imposed a maximum of 0.30 ppm of dieldrin on fish products . The eggs of bluefish caught off South Carolina contain 4.11 ppm of DDT residues . According to Dr. Lionel A. Walford , director of the U.S. Bureau of Sport Fisheries laboratory at Sandy Hook , N.J. , where most of the research on Atlantic coast bluefish has been done , these South Carolina bluefish were probably migrating north from Florida when caught .

The majority of fish tested also had traces of BHC , another chlorinated hydrocarbon , in the flesh and eggs .

As Taylor Quinn of the FDA remarked as this article was being prepared , " It 's unusual , to say the least , to find BHC in fish . " WARF Institute also tested all egg @# and flesh samples for residues of PCBs , the abbreviated name given to the polychlorinated biphenys , a synthetic chemical compound used by various industries . PCBs are heat resistant and are widely used in the electrical industry as insulating fluids for transformers and capacitors . They are also used in plastics and adhesives . PCBs have been made in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such in fish and birds until a few years ago . Chemically similar to DDT , they baffled investigators who reported finding " unknown but chlorine-containing compounds . " In 1966 Dr. Soren Jensen , a Swedish scientist , was able to separate the compounds from DDT and identify them as PCBs in a sea eagle and in the bodies of more than 200 fish taken from different parts of Sweden . Dr. Jensen then analyzed eagle feathers in a museum collection . Some of the feathers were collected as far back as 1880 , but Dr. Jensen first found PCB residues in feathers collected in 1944 . After Dr. Jensen published a paper on his findings , Dr. Robert Risebrough of the Institute of Marine Resources at the University of California at Berkeley found PCBs in a number of Californian , Mexican and Arctic sea birds . He noted that the highest levels of PCBs in birds were from those closest to industrialized areas . In a later investigation he also found PCBs in samples of mother 's milk from women in San Francisco and Los Angeles . In a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ establishment of tolerance limits of the compound in human food . Thus far , the FDA has set no standard . Another scientist , Robert Huggett of the Virginia Institute of Marine Science , says the toxicity of PCBs to marine animals seems to be about the same as that of DDT . At present , the Virginia Institute of Marine Science is conducting studies to determine the levels of PCB ? in estuarine sediments , oysters , fish and crabs in the Chesapeake . The institute is also trying to locate the origins of the PCBs . At the Bureau of Commercial Fisheries lab in Gulf Breeze , Dr. Thomas Duke and associates have found that only 1.0 part per billion of PCBs in water will adversely affect the growth of oysters . The precise significance of the WARF findings of PCB residues in the eggs and flesh of the fish submitted by SI has yet to be determined . However , PCBs are present in the flesh and eggs of all samples . The WARF findings , it should be noted , are estimates based on one peak on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ data for SI and who have experience in the field ' say the estimates are valid . The highest PCB residues in flesh are in the Hudson River striped bass , 4.01 ppm . The California striped bass had the highest PCB residues in eggs , 17.0 ppm . Other egg residues of possible significance were Hudson stripers , 11.4 ppm ; South Carolina bluefish , 2.81 ; and Rappahannock stripers , 2.31 . In assessing the WARF findings for SI , Dr. Robert Smolker , an ecologist at the State University of New York at Stony Brook , said , " I 'm horrified by some of the data . I am quite surprised to find such residues in fish from the ocean , but I certainly do n't think people should panic . " What , then , should the public do or demand ? There are a number of steps that can be taken . For one , the study is merely a first effort , and nationwide monitoring programs of more samples are needed to determine the presence and levels of contaminants in wildlife . Moreover , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effects of new pesticides coming on the market . This research is very expensive . It now costs as much as $10 million to clear a new pesticide for federal registration . As of this year , however , the Department of the Interior has a ceiling of $3 million in appropriations for all pesticide research , and of that less than $700,000 is allotted to the Bureau of Sport Fisheries and Wildlife for fish research . Several scientists have proposed that the additional needed money come not from Government funds but be raised instead by imposing a small excise tax , based on volume sold , on pesticide manufacturers . No scientist queried doubted the need for pesticides ; the only question was which pesticides @#  | will not damage the environment . At present , problems remain considerable and seemingly insoluble . There has been a great deal of talk about phasing out DDT , but DDT continues to be used on a substantial basis , and the same is true of other persistent chlorinated hydrocarbons . For instance , there has been a rapid increase in the use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substitutes for DDT , and both these compounds , which can be discerned in animals only after very involved laboratory testing , are starting to turn up in all sorts of places . Not long ago Drs . Richard Schoettger and David Stalling of the U.S. Bureau of Sport Fisheries and Wildlife pesticide laboratory in Columbia , Mo . began a study of still another chlorinated hydrocarbon , endrin , in fish . They planned to feed the fish food containing endrin residues of 0.1 to 0.5 ppm . They ordered their test fish , channel catfish brood stock from national hatcheries and , as a routine check , they analyzed some of these fish for endrin . To their dismay , they discovered that the catfish already contained 0.5 to 0.88 ppm of endrin , more than was to be given them in the test food . This should not be surprising . Schoettger has yet to find a commercial dry fish food for sale in the U.S. that is not contaminated by chlorinated hydrocarbons . Besides establishing a constant monitoring program of contaminants in fish and wildlife , efforts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Although worrisome , DDT residues in eggs are meaningless until we know that 5.0 ppm of DDT residues in conjunction with 8.0 ppm of PCBs , or whatever the figures may be , kill off a certain percentage of the hatch , be it none , a third or 90% . Then , of course , we need to know what levels may be harmful to humans . Writing in Pesticides , Dr. Robert van den Bosch of the University of California at Berkeley points out that the public good requires that salesmen for pesticide manufacturers be brought un- . der control . " The salesman is the key to the system , for he serves as the diagnostician , therapist and pill dispenser , " van den Bosch says , " and what is particularly disturbing is that he need not demonstrate technical competence to perform in this multiple capacity . In other words , the man who analyzes pest problems , recommends the chemicals to be used and effects their sale is neither required by law to demonstrate ( by examination ) his professional qualifications ( as do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , beauticians , realtors , etc. ) nor is he licensed . Yet this person deals with extremely complex ecological problems and utilizes some of the most deadly and ecologically disruptive chemicals devised by science . " Instead of permitting salesmen stimulated by commissions and bonuses to sell pesticides to the ultimate user , van den Bosch proposes that they be replaced by professional pest-control advisers who would be subject to examination , licensing and a code of conduct similar to physicians . This done , van den Bosch says , " The company-affiliated salesman , with his built-in conflict of interest and sales motivation , can be phased out of pest-control advisement . Direct contact between the salesman and the lay user of insecticides can be eliminated . Just as the drug salesman deals only with the physician , not with the patient , the salesman of toxic pesticides can be required to deal only with the pest-control adviser . " Sources of harmful pollution ? mercury , PCBs or pesticides ? must be identified and stopped . Monitoring and source identification must also be conducted on other probable contaminants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy metals . Testifying last August before the U.S. Senate subcommittee on environmental pollution , Dr. Henry Schroeder of Dartmouth dealt with mercury , cadmium , lead , nickel , beryllium and antimony . " I must emphasize that environmental pollution by toxic metals is a much more serious and much more insidious problem than is pollution by organic substances , such as pesticides , weed killers , sulphur dioxide , oxides of nitrogen , carbon monoxide and other gross contaminants of air and water . . . . Most or- ganic substances are degradable by n. ural processes . Once we control th. use , they will leave little or no residue but no metal is degradable . Once dui : from the earth , metals stay with us an , : what we are now accumulating will be around as long as we are . " Government officials must enforce antipollution laws and be on guar. : against the spread of possible contaminants . There have been all too many in- stances of cover-up . Last month there was a ruckus when the Canadian go- - in @# the province @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The fact is that this danger was known five years ago when Bruce Wright , director of the Northeastern Wildlife Station in Frederickton , published a paper about DDT and woodcock . Wright says he was told then that publication of his study was " not in the best interests of the province . " Wright says government funds for support of the station were later cut . Last year the provincial government finally abandoned using DDT. but New Brunswick will have the legacy for years to come . Soil scientists report that DDT is at least eight inches deep in the forest floor . Much indiscriminate pollution of U.S. waters could be stopped by enforcement of the Federal Refuse Act passed back in 1899 by Congress . This act , in part . makes it illegal " to throw , discharge , or deposit , or cause , suffer , or procure to be thrown , discharged or deposited either from or out of any ship , barge , or other floating craft of any kind , or from the shore , wharf , manufacturing establishment or mill , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than that flowing from streets and sewers and passing therefrom in a liquid state , into any navigable water of the U.S. " Laws may be passed and laws may be broken . In the end , the enforcement and abatement depend upon public opinion . If one lesson is to be learned it is that we can not release wide-ranging persistent poisons into the air or water . As . Ovid wrote 2,000 years ago : " Ill habits gather by unseen degrees . As brooks make rivers , rivers run to seas . "
