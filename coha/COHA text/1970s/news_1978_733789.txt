txt SO YOU 'RE JOGGING now . Playing a little racquetball , maybe . Getting that heart to puma faster . As for eating , you 've learned to control your appetite and lost that doughnut of fat around the middle . Perhaps you have even become a vegetarian , or gotten into periodic fasting . You 've cut out cigarets and coffee and your only vice is an occasional glass of white wine . But what are you doing for your dog ? Most likely nothing . Your dog is probably overweight , underexercised , and miserably out of shape . Maybe he even sneaks a smoke when you 're not home . BUT A MAN NAMED Bernie Brown is going to do something about all that . He 's about to extend the human fitness revolution to dogs . I 'm not kidding . In late September he will open a $500,000 facility that he said will be America 's first health resort for household pets .. The Countryside Animal Spa , as he 's named it , will be located on Ill . Hwy. 83 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offer what Brown calls a " complete health revitalization program " for dogs . Among the features will be Jacuzzi whirlpool baths , therapeutic massages , // Close-up With Jeff Lyon Ultimate in pampering : A fat farm for Fido // oil baths , deep heat reatments with sun lamps , strict weight-control diets , and coat conditioning . Ailing dogs will have the poisons driven from their systems by the administering of natural herbs . THERE ALSO WILL be a rigorous exercise program using Brown 's patented " Dog-A-Sizer " machine , designed exclusively for the Countryside Animal Spa . Each animal will have his or her own fitness plan , tailored to individual needs , and the amount of exercise will be built up gradually , the way a human builds up his running or swimming endurance . " I guess you could call it a fat farm for dogs , " Brown says . This is by no means all a pet owner will find at Countryside . The spa also will offer full boarding facilities . If you 're traveling and leaving your dog behind , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colors Lnd made out of germ-free , scratch resistant Translucite , instead of the drab , unsanitary concrete block used in most kennels . Your pet will have his own 12-foot outdoor run , and at night he 'll sleep on a heated fiberglass resting bench that Pulls out from the wall . Each suite will have FM music piped in . In summer there will be air conditioning , and in winter the tile floor will give off radiant heat . COUNTRYSIDE also will offer a full program of training classes , conducted by Bernie and his wife , Elaine , who 've been working with dogs for more than 20 years and who together have won more than 75 obedience trials . Bernie is regarded as one of the top trainers in the Chicago area . " We 've sunk everything into this Mace , " he said . " I 've had the idea for years . The reception room alone cost me $18,000 , and it was designed by Joyce Davis , a member of the American Association of Interior Decorators . She designed an outdoor country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , grass , and waterfalls , and you walk on cobblestones . " WE 'RE SERIOUS about this health program . Most owners kill their pets with kindness . They keep them too fat . We get dogs in our kennel that have to be rolled in , and the owners say ' Now , here 's sweetheart 's food , ' and they 're carrying huge grocery bags . " Same thing with exercise . They walk the animal to the corner and say , Okay , he 's had his exercise . Actually a dog should be made to run alongside on a leash while you ride a bicycle . " We 'd like to do for dogs what people are doing for themselves these days . But a dog would look funny on a racquetball court . So what we 'll do is when you bring your dog in to be boarded we 'll say , Wait , that animal 's not in good shape ; he 's flabby ; his muscle tone is poor . Let us get your dog back in shape . " First , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll put him on our exercycle , where he 'll be forced to trot , first for a minute , then for longer periods . It gets their cardiovascular system going . How much trotting will depend on the age and condition of the dog . " WE 'LL HAVE REAL Jacuzzis , like humans use . We submerge all our dogs in whirlpools . We consider our dogs jocks . " We 'll also have rub tables . My wife and I have studied naturopathy . We 've learned to massage our nerves to cure headaches , manipulate the spine , and so on . We do the same for all our dogs . A dog 's nervous system is similar to man 's , you know . We put them right up on the table , pull back their coats , and give them a rubdown . It gets their blood flowing to their veins and arteries . They love it . They fall fast asleep on the table . " Then we 'll give them oil massages for their coats . Get rid of flakiness . And deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " WE 'LL ALSO USE health herbs . We work with a woman who has a master 's degree in herbs . We had a Doberman with the bloat . Three vets told us to put her to sleep . Then this herbalist put the dog on a set of herbs  --  black oak , a little jasmine , and so on . Three months later the dog 's up to full weight and almost in show condition . " The woman 's cured dogs that had arthritis so had they could n't walk . She puts dogs on certain herbs and they get no ticks , no fleas . You do n't have to give them heartworm pills . She works miracles . It 's amazing . " Bernie Brown is running way ahead of the pack , so to speak . If you do n't beIMve it , here 's what happened when I called two other local kennels and asked about their health facilities . First , the Inn Towne Pet Motel : " Do we have a Jacuzzi ? Um , just a moment , I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sir , what is a Jacuzzi ? Oh . Uh , no . But we 'll give your dog a complimentary bath after five days . " AND THEN THE American Pet Motel , which advertises four-poster brass beds and fresh linen daily for your dog : " Do we have whirlpool baths ? No , I do n't believe we ? ha , ha ? do . " " How about oil baths and body massages ? And sun lamp treatments ? " " No . Ha ! I 'm afraid not . Not for dogs , anyway . " I do n't know where your head is . But if you 're into all this health stuff , I 'll add just this from Bernie Brown : " Send me your dog for 10 days , and I 'll make a new man of him . "
