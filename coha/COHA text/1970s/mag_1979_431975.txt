 |p506  FOR LONG MOMENTS in the turquoise world beneath Bahamian waters nothing moved save my spent air ; with each breath a burst of pearly bubbles climbed languidly toward our other world , some thirty feet above . Absorbed in mutual contemplation , that marvelous animal and I hung faceto-face only a flipper 's length apart : a man and a dolphin . I reached out my hand , to bridge the vast gulf between us . Gingerly ( for here was a wild creature from somewhere in the surrounding sea , and that was the marvel of it ) ? gingerly , I touched the slim gray snout and ventured to stroke the smooth , rubbery melon , the dolphin 's bulging brow . His eye narrowed , but the animal held steady ; then the mouth opened , as if inviting me to match this fragile trust . I clasped the lower jaw , across rows of sharp , hard teeth ; the mouth closed to hold me lightly , yet fast . Had my hand been a mullet , now .... For long moments , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hung there in strange communion , a man and a dolphin , each of us grasping the other . Or , perhaps more truly , trying to . He was a sleek , gray , spotted dolphin , Stenella plagiodon , obviously young and male , slightly over six feet long . The divers whose companionship he sought , off the island of San Salvador , had named him Sandy . He appeared two years ago , alone , approaching dive boats warily , then more boldly . At last an engine 's growl would bring him racing from a distance to fling himself in a great jubilant leap before the bow : a wild , free animal , eager to share the company of humans ( pages 511-13 ) . No one knows why . One hears of such dolphin behavior occasionally ? at least half a dozen times in this century ? and the ancients observed it too , but it remains unexplained . No one ever saw Sandy with another dolphin . Perhaps , ostracized from his herd , he sought the closest kin he coul find ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , returning , as did primeval dolphins , to the sustenance and safety of our mother sea . For a year Sandy swam and played with d lighted divers off San Salvador and then , as ruptly as he had come , he went away . No one knows where .  |p514  I wonder often what Sandy made of me that day . I know I have spent much time and travel since ? to Atlantic and Pacific Coasts , to the Gulf of Mexico and Hawaii ? attempting to understand his kind . Along the way I met many others who shared that elusive goal . Some sought to capture dolphins , and others wanted to set them free . I talked with fishermen who rely on them for a livelihood , trainers who teach them clever tricks , veterinarians who treat their surprisingly human ills , psychologists probing their unfathomed minds . Some viewed dolphins with mystical awe , almost as little men in wet suits ; others admired them as " extremely efficient predators . " I found three scientists trying to communicate with them ? and one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But no one , I discovered , can long remain indifferent to dolphins . These intelligent cetaceans ? playful , curious , sensual , and intensely social , with an inexplicable affinity for humankind ? inspire affection and , always , wonderment . The irony is that such amiable animals can generate such controversy , bitterness , and trouble . Among the least of the problems posed by these smaller toothed whales ( Odontoceti ) is what to call them : dolphins or porpoises ? Purists refer to members of the distinctly snouted families Delphinidae and Platani - tidae as " dolphins . " They apply " porpoise " only to a few species of Phocoenidae that lack a pronounced rostrum , or beak , and have spade-shaped rather than conical teeth . Most fishermen and sailors ( and some scientists too ) call them all porpoises ; this at least avoids confusion with the game fish also called the dolphin . Use dolphin and porpoise interchangeably , I have finally concluded , and no one will bother to correct you . Taxonomists calipering their bleached bones disagree about how many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? half a ndred or so . They inhabit every ocean , u:d even rivers in South America and Asia . In size they range from an almost dainty harbo r porpoise , some five feet long , to the twenty-five-foot , seven-ton Orcinus orcathe killer whale ( foldout pages 508-10 ) . Most widely seen , however , are the common dolphin ( Delphinus delphis ) that lopes like music on a ship 's bow wave and the familiar " porpoises " of every oceanarium , bottlenose dolphins of the genus Tursiops , .. he ones with the irresistible built-in grins . S CHARMED as any 5-year-old by that accidental smile and the dolphin 's A sportive nature is Dr. Kenneth S. Noran eminent cetacean authority who is often consulted by other experts . He calls the animals porpoises , and himself simply a field biologist ; I found him on the redwoodshaded campus of the University of California at Santa Cruz . It was Ken Norris who put the stamp of scientific proof on the dolphin 's astonishing ability to " see " underwater with bursts of sound. * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , blindfolded a Tursiops with suction cups and found it could weave perfectly through an underwater metal maze . ) A dolphin , he told me , produces a rich variety of sounds by shifting air between nasal sacs inside the skull ( pages 530-31 ) , much as you can make a balloon squeak or hiss . Trains of high-frequency clicks focus like sonic searchlights through a " lens " of fat in the forehead ; by swiftly analyzing the echoes , a dolphin can pinpoint a vitamin capsule dropped into the far end of a sizable pool . " I think we 'll find someday that they have an incredibly refined capability to form sonic images , " Norris said . " It 's already clear that they can hear ' the composition and  |p516  texture of objects around them . I suspect they can look into each other in eerie ways , inspecting the contours of internal air spaces . " Such sensitive sonic readings , he thinks , might even inform one dolphin about another 's emotional state . Paradoxically , a dolphin has no outer ear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sound travels through a thin " window " in the lower jawbone , Norris found . In those experiments he tried to fit a hood over the entire jaw of a young female bottlenose . The effort taught him something basic about porpoise personality : " They 'll try to play tricks on you , try to get away with something , act naive , " he said , smiling at the recollection . " We 'd put the cover on her jaw , and she 'd simply back up in the tank , sit up , and shake until she got it off . Then ? and this is the typically porpoise part of it ? she 'd pick up the cover and bring it back to us , as if to say , Well , that was an interesting trick . What 's next ? ' " Almost every porpoise trainer has tales of the dolphin 's cleverness and ingenuity . Like Jim Mullen of Marine World/Africa , U.S.A. , near San Francisco . Mullen encourages his animals to tidy up their quarters by tossing them a fish for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspicious , though , when a big 12-year-old bottlenose named Mr. Spock began claiming one reward after another , steadily delivering soggy scraps of paper . " It dawned on me finally that I was paying Spock an awful lot of fish for little bits of the same brown paper bag , " Mullen told me . " I found he had hidden a big stash of debris down in a corner of the pool , and was tearing it off one piece at a time . Was he ever training me ! " Last year Mr. Spock gained brief renown when he whimsically snatched an iron bolt from a diver working in his tank , and somehow swallowed it . After two days of unsuccessful retrieval attempts , Marine World officials finally turned to a specialist ? Clifford Ray . Ray , six feet nine inches tall , plays center for the Golden State Warriors professional basketball team . He oiled one of his endless arms and reached three feet nine inches down Mr. Spock 's gullet to pluck the offending artifact from his stomach . T SHOULD SAY one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cows , goats , and sheep . Indeed , blood-serum analysis and certain behavior patterns suggest that , before sliding back into the sea some fifty million years ago , the ancestral cetacean shared dim evolutionary linkage with today 's barnyard ruminants . Dr. Sam Houston Ridgway , a distinguished research veterinarian at the U. S. Naval Ocean Systems Center ( NOSC ) in San Diego , offered me other parallels : " Dolphins concentrate salts in their kidneys as well as a camel , " he said . " And they need only about as much sleep as a cow ? maybe two or three hours a day . Curiously , they seem to be able to sleep with one eye open , and with half the brain still awake . " Dr. Ridgway , a formidable figure with a piratical black beard , has treated every sort of dolphin ailment , from pulling a tooth to mending a deep propeller gash ? " like suturing an automobile tire " ? to performing a hysterectomy . He showed me a respirator  |p518  needed for major surgery ; an anesthetized porpoise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pneumonia , parasites , and skin problems , I learned , and stress may lead to ulcers of the stomachs . ( Rx : One gallon of ground-fish-and-Maalox broth , by tube , three times daily . ) Dr. Ridgway has performed many pioneering studies , notably in porpoise diving physiology . When I spoke with him , he was tracing complex muscle-firing patterns in the animal 's sound-making apparatus . A few days later , on the windy north shore of Oahu beside Kaneohe Bay , I watched other U. S. Navy scientists , at NOSC 's Hawaii Laboratory , studying porpoises with more practical applications in mind . Like sonar . " Our present electronic equipment ca n't match a dolphin 's abilities ? not by a factor of ten , " said Richard Soule , a tall , easy-mannered Californian who heads the Biosystems Division of the laboratory . The Navy hopes to close this gap , he told me , with bionic sonar , modeled after the animal 's natural equipment . A dolphin emits many of its inquiring echolocation sounds at frequencies far higher than we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ porpoise pulses , beam them into the water , and , with 518  |p519  puter , " stretch " the echoes down to hearing range , allowing blindfolded to discriminate between two targets well as a porpoise . ultimate goal , of course , is a bionic sock box , and it is easy to imagine its valdivers at night , or , say , in a torpedoce system . The Navy wo n't discuss ' ble uses . But , said Dick Soule with r restraint , " detection and classificawill be very significantly advanced . " NGSIDE one of a dozen floating por , oise pens in Kaneohe Bay , biologist Earl Murchison , wearing a jaunty golf cap , plays an amazing game of Twenty Questions with a female bottlenose dolphin named Kae . I listened through earphones as Earl , in a series of tests , lowered individual objects of various sizes and shapes into the water , 30 feet from Kae . Sounding an underwater tone , Earl asked the animal : " Is there anything out there ? " Kae swept the pen with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the characteristic staccatoclick sound struck my ear like an audible dotted line . Satisfied , the animal turned and replied : Nudging a red ball meant " yes , " and  |p520  the blue one , " no . " She said yes and gulped a choice Columbia River smelt . But Kae really impressed me when faced with question number two : " Is it cy-lindrical ? " Each time Earl lowered a cylinder of any size or proportion ? short and squat or long and narrow ; whether made of wood , steel , brass , plastic , or aluminum ; hollow or solid ? Kae sized it up with her sonar and replied correctly , " Yes . " When he slipped a length of angle iron into the water , Kae disdainfully snorted a bubble from her blowhole and answered , " No . " Clearly this animal now understood the concept of a cylinder . " Next we may try the question , Is it metal or not ? ' " Earl explained . " Then maybe Is it moving ? ' With simple yes-and-no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ porpoise sees ' with its sonar . " The Navy 's interest in porpoises began in 1960 , when someone wondered how they could swim so fast . Subsequent tests clocked a bottlenose at a disappointing 16 knots , and the swifter spotted dolphin at 211/2 knots . To keep pace with faster vessels , they hitchhike on the bow or stern waves . " Of course dolphins may swim more efficiently than they should be able to in theory , " said Dick Soule . " The Soviets are doing some work in this area ; maybe we should be too . " Conceivably , such studies could lead to improved ship-hull designs . With him one blustery day I watched another test of a dolphin 's physical limits : How deep can it dive ? Pitching uneasily a few miles outside Kaneohe Bay , our small boat unreeled a long cable , dangling an electronic pinger that sounded a steady tone 750 feet below . Some yards away a handsome dark Pacific bottlenose ( Tursiops gilli ) named Lii eyed his trainers aboard an outboard-powered rubber Zodiac . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thrusting down with powerful flukes . By stopwatch , 62.5 seconds later the pinger 's monotone suddenly ceased ; Lii had reached those black , crushing depths and nudged the off button . At 750 feet his flexible rib cage had collapsed , all air driven from his lungs , thus preventing nitrogen from being absorbed into the bloodstream ? which helps explain why dolphins do n't suffer from the bends . Resting only briefly between dives , Lii repeated the feat half a dozen times . " We 're lowering the pinger 50 feet a week to see how deep he 'll go , " explained Don McSheehy , who manages NOSC 's deep-dive program . " We 've got 2,500 feet of cable , and I think we 'll use it all . " ( Three months later I learned that Lii had reached 1,700 feet before the experiment ended . ) All the way back to his pen Lii swam beside the rubber boat like an obedient Doberman at heel . This dependable " open-sea release " is quite crucial to any practical use of porpoises by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Zodiac , training a porpoise in the lime-green shallows of the bay . I turned to Dick Soule : " What .... " " Classified . " He smiled serenely , gazing straight ahead . CLASSIFIED . Ask how the U. S. Navy is using dolphins nowadays , and that is the inevitable reply . In two decades its scientists have published more than 175 papers on their marine-mammal research . But , predictably , the public is more captivated by what the Navy will not disclose . Two stories , particularly , surface with the regularity of a dolphin coming up for air . The first , perhaps inspired by a popular novel and movie , suggests that Navy animals have been trained to carry explosive packs and blow up enemy vessels ? kamikaze porpoises , so to speak . The second is even more bizarre and chilling . Porpoises , it claims , were sent to Viet Nam trained to kill enemy frogmen with a hollow lance worn on the beak . When rammed , the story goes , the swimmers literally ballooned as a gas cartridge emptied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of floating corpses ) . " Nonsense ! " In his Pentagon office Harris B. Stone , who is in charge of the Navy porpoise work as director of research a development plans for the Chief of Nav Operations , flatly denied both tales . A stocky , vigorous civilian , Mr. Sto spoke frankly . " We have deployed porpoi : in open-ocean work , " he admitted . " We making use of their remarkable sensory c pabilities . But we are not about to telegra how and where and what they 're used for  |p521  tential adversary by discussing it . e Navy , " he declared , " has never used ises for anything that would harm eithe animals or any human being . To me ' killer dolphin ' story is ludicrous . I k I can show you what started it . " He strode to a cabinet and took out what ed like a diver 's knife in a black plastic th . In place of a blade a keen arrowlike nt tipped a hollow metal shaft ; the handp held a carbon dioxide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protect - ers against sharks , " he said . " You can buy it in dive shops . But somebody had make a James Bond thriller out of it ! " Yes , half a dozen Navy porpoises were t to Viet Nam , he said , to test their transability over long distances , and their ptability ? " tests you simply ca n't make a laboratory . " Cam Ranh Bay , a foreign , pical environment , teemed with ships debris ; the Navy wanted to know , he tinued , whether its animals could perdetection and surveillance functions er those difficult circumstances . " We experimented with them there for ut a year , then moved them to Guam ? a ferent environment ? for another year or Then we brought them home . " Even aside from developing porpoiselike onic sonar , the Navy 's interest in the anis continues . " What habits do they have t we can use ? " said Mr. Stone specula-ely . " Can we employ them to reduce the ards to humans in diving tasks ? Can we Lie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , he said , it will be with the animals ' interests firmly in mind . " We treat them as we do our humans . We do our absolute best to keep them healthy and well . That 's common sense , when you consider what it costs to capture and train a porpoise nowadays . " It costs plenty , I learned from Mike Haslett , a lean , tanned Floridian , as we skimmed the wind-ruffled flats around Tampa Bay in his speedy workboat , just porpoise watching . ( I 've met no one who tires of this gentle sport . ) A tobacco-chewing former paratrooper and oceanarium manager , Mike has skillfully netted about a hundred porpoises for the Navy and various shows . " I love all animals , " he said , spitting rather discreetly to @# leeward , " but porpoises are the top of the line ! " With two brothers he has established the Marine Mammal Foundation in St. Petersburg , dedicated to dolphin research and the rescue of stranded animals . ( Every year along the East and Gulf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and many die . Aristotle pondered the mystery centuries ago ; scientists today speculate about disease , parasites , suicide , even an atavistic urge to find safety on land , but they still can not adequately explain it . ) In 1972 Congress passed the Marine Mammals Protection Act ( MMPA ) , making it illegal for U. S. citizens to " harass , hunt , capture , or kill " dolphins anywhere in U. S. or international waters without a permit . " I think the day after the law was passed a black market opened up , " Mike told me . " Just recently I was offered $50,000 to catch 40 animals in an illegal operation down in Costa Rica . " So widely has Flipper 's engaging smile captured public ( Continued on page 528 ) 521  |p528  fancy that oceanariums around the globe ca n't get enough animals . There are few proficient porpoise catchers outside the U. S. , and a healthy specimen fetches between $5,000 and $10,000 , no questions asked , before it is even flown to Europe . A Swiss zoo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Considering such returns , he fears , " any mullet fisherman might be tempted to throw a net around a school of porpoises , and never mind how many he drowns . " I checked further with Charles M. Fuss , Jr. , special agent in charge of the Law Enforcement Division , National Marine Fisheries Service ( NMFS ) , in St. Petersburg . He confirmed that a lively foreign market exists . His agency , which enforces the Marine Mammals Protection Act , recently broke up a ring conspiring to capture porpoises in the Caribbean . " They were aiming to sell hundreds of animals to oceanariums in Europe , South America , and Japan , with an expected take of a couple of million dollars . " NMFS agents nipped that in the bud . Now , however , a new threat looms : One American who netted 21 bottlenose dolphins in Bahamian waters was found guilty in Key West , but an appeals court overturned the conviction on grounds the law was not specific enough . Special agent Fuss shrugs . " We 've shut down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We suspect a couple of people are engaged in this kind of thing right now , but we ca n't devote time to cases that wo n't stand up in court . " Unless Congress comes to the rescue again , the porpoise , it seems , will lose . ON ANOTHER FRONT , though , the beleaguered porpoise appears at last to be winning . A major mystery is why , in the vast reaches of the tropical eastern Pacific , big yellowfin tuna are so often found in the company of porpoises ? usually spotted , spinner , or common dolphins , often found coursing the sea in herds of thousands . Experts suspect the common bond is food , but no one knows . Whatever the reason , the odd association has helped to build a billiondollar fishing industry in the U. S. : purse seining for tuna ( pages 522-4 ) . The idea was simple : Find a school of porpoises " carrying " tuna , herd them into a tight bunch with speedboats , drop a big seine around them and purse it shut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ net , release the porpoises , and keep the fish . The trouble was , capricious winds , currents , or mechanical breakdowns sometimes collapsed the nets , some 400 feet deep and as long as three-quarters of a mile . Many porpoises , entangled in the mesh , suffocated and drowned . Fishermen themselves probably did n't realize how many . But an NMFS biologist , William F. Perrin , returned from a tuna cruise , totted up mortality figures , and projected an appalling statistic : In 1966 an estimated 244,000 porpoises perished in U. S. nets alone . Over the years , quite clearly , millions of the animals have died . Conservation groups , dismayed and angered at this apparently wanton killing , proclaimed a boycott on tuna and demanded an end to fishing " on porpoise . " The MMPA permitted it to continue , but directed that steps be taken to reduce the toll to a rate " approaching zero mortality . " Stung by environmentalists ' attacks . fearing for their livelihood , tuna men angrily spoke of " going foreign " ? selling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On southern California streets bumper stickers proclaimed : " Endangered Species ? San Diego Fishermen ! " That city is home port to most of the 130 U. S. tuna seiners ; I found many tied along Harbor Drive . Black nets lay flaked high on their afterdecks ; with glassed-in crow 's nests staring empty-eyed from raked masts . the vessels resembled huge angular pelicans in repose . And like seabirds , they are formidable fishing machines . The modern purse seiner can cost six million dollars . It 's 200 feet long , carries a crew of 16 , and , using advanced satellite navigation , can cruise at 15 knots for three months On a single trip it can catch and freeze a thousand tons of tuna ? worth $800 a ton ? and it makes three or four trips a year . Their headquarters ? the American Tunaboat Association ( ATA ) ? stands at Tuna Lane , and is topped by a radio mast that links vessels with home port from as far away as Africa . ATA 's general manager is  |p529  August Felando @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Congressmen may account for prematurely graying temples . Felando spread his hands fatalistically . We wear the black hats , " he told me. - We 're fighting a public-relations battle we ca n't possibly win . Listen ? nobody wants to kill porpoises . The fisherman needs porpoises in order to make his living . " It was the tuna men themselves , he pointed out , who devised the so-called backdown maneuver and finer-mesh panels in the nets , two measures largely responsible for saving porpoise lives . The industry has also conducted " skippers ' panels " to refine porpoise-rescue techniques , and has dedicated several of the best vessels to scientificresearch cruises aimed at finding answers to the tuna-porpoise problem . Those studies , with rapid modification of gear and techniques and regulations imposed by the National Marine Fisheries Service , demonstrated that we can have our tuna and porpoises too . The NMFS established a quota of 52,000 mortalities in 1978 ; it will decline to 31,000 next year . As it turned out , the 1978 toll was only 15,000 . Does this mean the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe a single dead animal is one too many . Fishermen , who now release 99.9 percent of the porpoises they net , doubt that The Trouble With Dolphins  |p532  they can ever meet a zero-mortality goal . And anytime they exceed the steadily declining quota , the issue will flare again . Yet , in the long run , the canny porpoise itself may solve the problem . In the skipper 's stateroom aboard the gleaming thousand-tonner Raffaello , Capt . George Sousa ? a third-generation fisherman ? pointed out a significant trend . " For years now we 've been learning how to save porpoises , " he said . " But the porpoises have been learning too . Nowadays when you put a school in a net , they just lie there calmly , saying , Hey , take it easy , fellas ? it 's just a routine we got ta go through . ' They 've been there before . But they 're getting harder to wrap all the time . " There 's one bunch of spotters ' off Costa Rica we call The Untouchables @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you try to lay your net around them , they dive right under it , taking the fish with them . " Who knows ? Unless we find some better way , maybe in five years it just wo n't be economical to fish on porpoise anymore . " FISHERMAN 'S ALLY , a friend to man ? through centuries the dolphin has inspired tales of assistance to humans by helping swimmers in distress , or driving off sharks , thought to be the dolphins ' mortal enemy . The evidence , however , is far from clear . True , the animals sometimes assist their young or injured to the surface to breathe . " It even happens between species , " says biologist Ken Norris . " I 've seen a pilot whale helping a sick Dall 's porpoise . " But skeptics point out that similar " assistance " toward humans might be simply a form of play , or even aggressive behavior . On rare occasions an exhausted swimmer has reported being nudged toward shore ; but as one expert points out , we 're not likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sea . ( During World War II downed U. S. airmen once had to drive away a dolphin that was enthusiastically shoving their raft toward a Japanese-held beach . ) Are sharks and porpoises deadly enemies ? Forrest G. Wood , a senior scientist with the Navy and longtime observer of porpoises , sums it up this way : " Sometimes sharks eat porpoises . Sometimes porpoises attack sharks . Sometimes the two ignore each other completely . And that 's all you can safely say about it . " It would be fascinating , of course , to hear what porpoises might have to say about it ? if anything . They whistle and chirp and squeak and click and groan . . . but do they have a language of their own ? The dolphin 's sonic repertoire appears to include emotional signals ( one rising-falling birdlike cry almost certainly means " Help ! " ) and even individual " signature " calls : " I am Joe Dolphin . " But most scientists I spoke to believe , like behaviorist and veteran trainer Karen Pryor , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human frown , or sigh , or giggle , than to a human word . " Broadly speaking , language implies an ability to convey thoughts by using arbitrary symbols ? words ? in proper syntax . That ability , science once told us , resides only in the human species . Man 's self-definition , however , once so comfortably clear and sharp , has recently crumbled around the edges . Wild chimpanzees demonstrated that the talent for using tools does not , in itself , spell Homo sapiens. * And the age-old thought that only man can have a thought has lately fallen under scientific sniper fire . And now , electrifyingly-. tame chimps and a charming gorilla named Koko have shown that other species besides our own can learn a language . t So it may be with dolphins . Beside a sun-splashed training pool at the country 's original oceanarium , Marineland. near St. Augustine , Florida , I watched a graduate student , William Langbauer , and several associates give a pair of porpoises a language lesson ( page 529 ) . The Porpoise Language Acquisition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the University of Pennsylvania , with a chimp named Sarah . Ar trary black-and-white symbols are paint on metal rectangles designed to cling to submerged magnetic board . Langbauer was teaching a bottlen named Snoopy to match identical symbo Using his snout with a juggler 's e  |p533  Snoopy maneuvered the metal symbol into place . But he and his sleek gray pool mate , Betty , were a long way from conversing with their teacher . These are trials that the porpoises must master before they can begin to form a vocabulary . " We 've spent six months getting this far , " Bill told me . " But it 's a two-way street . Eventually they 'll be manipulating these same symbols to talk back to us . " How long might that take ? If they understand the syntax of a twoword sentence in another six months , we 'll be making good progress . " He smiled . Things should move much faster then . " THINGS HAD MOVED all too fast in a similar project some 5,000 miles away at a marine laboratory on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ M. Herman , professor of psychology at the University of Hawaii , ruefully regarded a pair of empty concrete tanks ( page 539 ) . He is known as a cool and disciplined scientist , but I sensed at one point that he might be close to tears . He summed up his work over the past decade with two Tursiops named Puka and Kea ; studies dealing largely with vision , hearing , learning , intelligence , and memory . Puzzlingly , a dolphin can see both in and out of water equally well . And in tests of its auditory memory ? remembering a specific tone ? a dolphin easily outperformed another highly acoustical animal , man . But most exciting to Dr. Herman and his students was Kea 's relatively swift grasp of a 12-word sonic language . " We might have extended her vocabulary easily to fifty words or more , " the bearded , sunburned scientist said . " She was showing comprehension of simple sentences ? Fetch the ball , ' for example , or Touch the ring . ' The next step was two-way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some clues to an even deeper puzzle : How did human language itself evolve ? That next step never came . Showing me around , Dr. Herman paused before a blackboard . It still bore a message chalked there months earlier , preserved bitterly like a wartime ruin : WENT SURFIN ' ? KENNY , PUKA , STEVE AND KEA . ALOHA . Late one night two former attendants , Kenneth LeVasseur and Steven Sipman , had loaded the dolphins into a van and released them into the open ocean . Dr. Herman was convinced that his animals were dead . They were Atlantic dolphins , and had been hand-fed for more than eight years . It was unlikely , he felt , that their Hawaiian cousins would accept them , and without the security of a herd they might be easy prey for sharks . He did see Kea again soon after her release in Oahu 's Yokohama Bay . Efforts to recapture her failed , for ironically she had been taught to avoid a net , but for two days and nights someone remained in the water with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Dr. Herman related . " I realized how strange this new place must be for her , how frightening . One of her eyes had been injured ; it was completely closed . But I felt she was comforted by my presence . " Time and again the dolphin circled him , swam out to sea , and came back . But then , midway through the second night , she failed to return . " I knew I 'd never see her again , " he said , in a voice that I could barely hear . Not far away , in a small apartment near Punchbowl Crater , I found a man who was equally moved by Kea 's release .  |p537  It was very emotional ? really beauti ' said Kenneth LeVasseur , his eyes aming . " We had the Milky Way directly erhead , and a full moon over the mouns .... A beautiful experience . We were - ing them what every animal or person ly deserves in life , his own freedom !

' They 're like humans in dolphin suits ; y 're akamai ? smart , really together . " Dr. Herman , he said , had sometimes reved the dolphins ' toys and deprived them human swimming company . " All these ntists are businessmen , slaveholders. ve formed an organization called  |p538  FREED ? Foundation for the Release of Every Enslaved Dolphin . " And so a pair of dolphins innocently swam into another developing storm . During LeVasseur 's trial , Greenpeace , the antiwhaling organization , issued a " Declaration of Dolphin Rights . " A New Jersey law professor demanded to know " by what privilege did we put those dolphins in the tank in the first place ? " Some advocates of this growing cause ? animal rights ? turned for support to a pioneer dolphin researcher , Dr. John C. Lilly . After efforts to teach dolphins to speak English in the 1960 's , he had released his animals because he " no longer wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animal rightists must have found his measured reply disappointing : " If the proponents of freeing captive dolphins have their way , by law or otherwise , proper scientific research will cease . " JOHN CUNNINGHAM LILLY , M.D. , is a neurophysiologist and a psychoanalyst and a controversy all by himself . No one in the world is more widely identified with dolphins . Indeed , one fancifully inclined might read his almost mystical empathy with them in his visage alone : A strong straight nose suggests a dolphin 's rostrum ; his hair ( bottlenose gray ) sweeps back from a prominent forehead . A faint , corners-ofthe-mouth smile and deep intelligence pooled behind metal-rimmed glasses complete a striking parallel . Dr. Lilly points out that a Tursiops brain weighs about 1,700 grams ; that of a human , about 1,450 . More significant , he says , are the dolphin 's unusually large " silent associational areas " ? those heavily fissured cortical regions where intellectual capacity such as language presumably resides . And , unlike many of his scientific colleagues , Dr. Lilly does not doubt that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the old Hawaiian whaling port of Lahaina , conducting a seminar for cetacean admirers from many walks of life . The setting was flawless , for here the gentle humpback whales come each winter to breed , and from time to time in the glinting channel a pale-flippered giant surfaced to emit a steamy sigh . At the workshop Dr. Lilly acknowledged his debt to oceanariums : " Without them we would n't know anything about dolphins . " Still , he suggested , the animals should be held captive no more than a year at a time . Oceanariums should develop into interspecies schools , where humans and cetaceans can learn from one another . How ? Without a hint of levity he proposed equipping dolphin tanks with telephones , and interconnecting oceanariums and buoyed stations at sea via satellite . We could then listen in while captives conversed with their relatives in the wild . " And when we get our communications equipment going , " he summed up matterof-factly , " people could talk to the dolphins themselves via telephone . " The equipment is being assembled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his home in a canyon high above Malibu , California . The foundation is Lilly 's brainchild , and its trustees range across a spectrum of talents : John himself . the scientist ; his lovely artist-writer wife . Toni ; a distinguished actor , Burgess Meredith ; a businessman-poet , Victor DiSuvero ; and a female surfer , Georgia Tanner . Keystone of the foundation is Project JANUS : Lilly 's renewed effort at interspecies communication after a lapse of several years . Janus ( whence " January " ) was the Roman god of gates and doorways and new beginnings . And like the deity his JANUS ( Joint Analog Numerical Understanding System ) will have two faces : one human . in air ; the other delphinic , underwater . Onto a glowing green computer screen young researcher named Dennis Kast was keyboarding abstruse equations . " He designing part of the equipment JANUS ? use , " Dr. Lilly explained . When completed , the array will ena man and dolphin , each in his own eleme to exchange precise sounds adjusted to t comfortable hearing range @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 64 sounds , c munication will be rapid , he is confident One early objective will be to see if an mal can master simple arithmetic . They so easily bored , he told me , that " you have  |p539  in terms of complex puzzles or you 'll r get a dolphin to do anything . " After tests in an oceanarium , he hopes to JANUS to sea ? " say , the Bahamas or ' da , where dolphins live in shallow waW'L-e might set up the apparatus on a t. or link the hydrophone and speaker by o to a shore station . I know we can interwild dolphins in communicating . " And suppose JANUS does pierce that taning barrier and John Lilly finally meets t long-sought alien mind ? what then ? at do you say after you say " hello " ? He thought . He stared somewhere , seeing something I could not . - They 've been around for an estimated 25 trillion years with a brain size equal to and Later greater than ours , " he replied . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , histories . It will take a lot of work , of course , before we get to the point where they can tell us stories we can understand . " I 'd like to know , too , if they have interspecies languages ; can an Orca talk to a Tursiops ? We might serve as a bridge between species , you know . " The corners of his mouth turned up ever so slightly more .  |p540  " That 's a human , arrogant position , is n't it ? They may laugh at us . " Then again they may not . It depends on whether you believe , like John Lilly , that dolphins are " quite as intelligent , quite as ethical , quite as sentient as humans . " The final trouble with dolphins is , nobody really knows . But , as Navy biophysicist C. Scott Johnson cogently puts it , " The guy on the street wants to believe these animals are as smart as he is . If you tell him it is n't so , he wants to punch you in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half-closed eye ( was that apprehension , or a droll wink ? ) more than a year ago , I have been asking the experts what they think . Most told me there is simply no way to measure a dolphin 's brainpower . But from those brave enough to venture a guess , I offer the following : ? Trainer Jim Mullen : " I have to gauge their intelligence on a level with our own . " ? Psychologist Louis M. Herman : " They are extremely flexible in what they can learn . I think we could probably teach a dolphin to do things at a level comparable to that of a chimpanzee . But one of the things we 've learned is that certain questions , like the comparative intelligence of animals , may not be worth asking . " ? Veterinarian Sam Ridgway : " I 've been working with them every day for 15 years , and I still ca n't tell you where they fit ? I guess somewhere in the neighborhood of the smarter animals like pigs , dogs , baboons , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agree with the idea that they 're between the dog and the chimpanzee , and closer to the chimpanzee . When you look at what chimps can do , that 's quite a compliment . " ? Porpoise catcher Mike Haslett : " I have to say I think a dog is as smart . " Take your choice ; I 'd rather not say what I think . I 'm as fond of dolphins as anyone , but I 'm not looking for a punch in the nose .
