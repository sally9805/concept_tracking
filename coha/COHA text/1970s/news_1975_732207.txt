txt Generalissimo Francisco Franco clung to life last night and at one point yesterday even showed slight improvement in his week-long fight against heart problems . Millions of Spaniards who remained faithful to their 82-year-old leader prayed  --  as he did , in his bedroom  --  at Sunday masses , while successive medical bulletins told of his resistance to death . Last night Prince Juan Carlos de BorbOn , General Franco 's designated successor , visited the general 's palace . The latest official medical bulletin , issued last night , said that the general 's condition had taken a critical turn for the worse and that he was bleeding in the stomach . It was the first time that the doctors had used the term " critical . " Earlier yesterday , the doctors reported he had spent a quiet night and that his condition was stationary . At 1:30 // decisive role to play here , " said a West German Social Democrat , Bruno Friedrich . " Polls that have been taken indicate that .80 per cent of the Spanish people would oppose dictatorship after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the United States would tolerate it and support it . " Mr. Friedrich 's misgivings about recent United States policy toward Spain are shared by other leftist European politicians . " We understand your need for military bases in Spain , " said Pierre Schori , an ' , aide to Premier Olof Palme of Sweden , " but why did Presi4ent Ford have to visit Franco ! there , last spring ? " The European parties , as they make contacts in Spain , have been carefully avoiding extremist movements like the Basque separatist organization or the Front of Revolutionary Antifascist Patriots . But even moderate political groupings are forbidden in Spain and meetings with outsiders can be dangerous . He and another Deputy made two trips to Spain , once in February and again in June . He and the other West German politicians interviewed say they doubt Spain will change overnight .

We believe that one clay Spain could be part of Europe , and the Spanish people should know we are prepared to let them evolve as they wish , . not to insist that they follow our example .

It included calls for the foundation of a federal , decentralized and democratic state , the immediate liberation of all political prisoners , freedom to organize labor unions , freedom to assemble . form political parties , express opinions freely and hold eencral elections .

The party is said to have close tics with the Communist party of Italy ; what its relations are with Moscow could not be learned . Mr. Friedrich , who spent five weeks in Spain between the end of July and the beginning of las . month , skirling the lx , v that forbids unauthorized gatherings of more than 19 people , conceded that his visit was a mission for his party to assess the likely post-Franco political scene . " This is not a revolutionary situation , " he says , " it 's a revolt of the well-off who see Franco 's regime is no longer appropriate to the times . A new Middle class has risen in the country and it feels isolated ? especially at times like the present , when the whole outside world seems to equate Spain with Franco and fascism . " Similar assessments were made by the more conservative Dr. Marx of the Christian Democratic party after ilk , shorter visits .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
