They arrived in England for the world championships with an untried boat and a crew that was considered too light , too old and too inexperienced to make any sort of challenge . They were , in fact , favorites for last place . " Let 's face it , " said one crew member , " we 've never beaten anybody . " Not until last week , that is . In a series of races that spanned four gray , windy days at Nottingham , the U.S. women 's eight finished second , defeating such heavyweights as the Soviet Union and West Germany . After the last race , as the Americans posed for pictures , the sun broke through to shine on their silver medals-and the tears of joy running down their cheeks . <P> The display of emotion was understandable . After years of borrowing equipment and training with little or no coaching , U.S. oarswomen had suddenly arrived as a major force in international racing . Now , for the first time , they can see themselves as serious contenders for a gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " says Number Two Oar Gail Pierson , " is still untapped . " <P> The exultant Americans actually comprised the first U.S. national team . Last June some 80 oarswomen competed for an invitation to the national training camp at Harvard in July . Thirty-two survivors won the dubious privilege of backcracking two-a-day workouts on the Charles River . No one was more surprised at their high pain tolerance than Harry Parker , successful coach of men 's crew at Harvard , who had signed on with no noticeable enthusiasm to coach the national women 's boat . Only five years before , when Radcliffe students approached him about forming a women 's crew , he had said no . " I was thoroughly a part of our culture , " he says . " I never thought women would be willing to work hard enough . " <P> The crew Parker culled from this summer 's candidates is a shellful of diversity . The veteran at 34 is Pierson , an M.I.T. economics professor who plans to take a year 's leave from teaching to concentrate on rowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State , has discovered a fighting streak in herself . " Ninety percent of rowing is between the ears , " she says . " You do n't have to be born an athlete . " Carol Brown , 22 , a political science major at Princeton , admits , " I 'm a masochist . I like to work myself very hard . " <P> The crew 's youngest member is Lynn Silliman , 16 , a 98-lb. coxswain from San Diego , who directs the boat with the aplomb of an old pro . The remainder of the crew comes from such schools as Radcliffe , Yale and Wisconsin . Excluding Silliman , they average an imposing 5 ft. 8 in. , 155 lbs . <P> Most Motivated . At Nottingham , that was practically lilliputian compared to most of the competition . The winning East Germans weighed in at an average of 20 lbs . heavier , but the Americans managed to outstroke eight other muscular boats with a combination of will and Parker 's smooth technique . " I 'd have to say these girls are among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said the coach . They were also the first Parker crew ever to race with red roses tied to their shoelaces.
