 | Inflation and the Prospects for Prosperity TEN YEARS AGO , as we moved into the 1960s , there was much public discussion of how the . S. economy would perform in the coming decade . Would it adequately meet the country 's expanding needs , or might it fall seriously short ? Until 1965 , things went very well . Prices edged up only moderately , while wages were rising more or less steadily , but not much more rapidly than productivity . As a result , there was little inflationary push , and economic growth was vigorous . Yet , forces were building beneath the surface that eventually set the situation askew . Now we look into the ' 70s and ask the same questions about our economic future . But the U.S. population could increase by 36 million in the ' 70s , compared with a gain of 26 million in the ' 60s . And the labor force will grow by perhaps as many as 15 million , compared with a I2.9-million rise in the past decade . ( The increase will be larger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the size of the armed forces . ) A bigger labor force will naturally require that more job opportunities be created , and the increased number of households  | ( perhaps 77 million , as compared with today 's 62 million ) will entail correspondingly expanded needs for housing , home furnishings , new cars , and a wide and costly variety of public services ? in education , health , transportation , public security , sanitation and so on . How successful will we be as a nation in meeting these needs ? The answer will depend in no small measure on the economy 's posture as we enter the decade . And in this respect a crucial difference can already be discerned between the ' 6os and the ' 70s . The difference is that there was no serious obstacle in the path of growth as the economy turned into the ' 6os . There is a major obstacle today . It is inflation . One of the most damaging misconceptions about economics is that inflation , somehow or other , promotes growth . Actually , the opposite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a country 's capability for achieving growth is greatest when costs and prices are relatively stable . Our own good growth record in the first half of the ' 6os , when prices were relatively stable , illustrates this truth . So also does the poor growth record of the second half of the ' 6os ? after inflation began to build up . One thing is certain : when the momentum of inflation is high , vigorous and sustained growth is impossible . There are three main reasons : First , inflation causes a variety of imbalances that impair the ability of the economy to operate smoothly and efficiently . For example , wag rise either slower than prices , cau ing hardships to workers , or fast than prices , in which case profi are squeezed . And , when profits a squeezed , investment in new plan and technology is discouraged , an the economy 's growth is slowed . Second , inflation slows savi n and discourages investment i fixed-income securities such a bonds and mortgages . Funds oftc go instead into land speculation c the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is basic growth depends on bond and mor gage credit : bond-financed publi facilities , for example , and housin and home construction . Third , inflation forces govern ? ment to adopt restrictive policies which , if successful , inevitably slow an economy 's growth , at least during the corrective period . The mea ures go by different names . Wes Germany had a " stabilization ' policy in 1967 ; France today has a " austerity " program ; the Unite States has a program now for gradual " disinflation . " Whatever the ! name , the result is always the same : . as steps are taken to cool an overheated economy , the growth rate slows down . The fact is that there is no painless escape from the necessity of building a non-inflationary base for the economy . If corrective measures are not adopted when circumstances call for them , inflation will get out of control and develop into boomand-bust . But if anti-inflationary 11 ) 76 INFLATION AND THE PROSPECTS FOR PROSPERITY ror  | p olicies are wisely designed , the dislocation in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been built , vigorous growth can be resumed ? provided expansionist policies are not pushed R hard that overheating gets started ' gain . This is precisely the mistake we made in the second half of the ' nos , and it is the root cause of our present problems . Almost as damaging in its economic effects as the mistaken belief that one need not worry too much shout inflation is the illusion that inflation can be overcome by direct i enrols over prices , wages and profu s , or by exhorting labor and business to adopt voluntary restraints . Economic logic and experience alike demonstrate that inflation can not he overcome by such methods . Their weakness is that they merely treat the symptoms of inflation , not its it uses . The plain fact is that the only way t , deal adequately with inflation is through limits on federal spending , higher taxes and tight money . And these restraints must be sufficiently tern and continued long enough to Actually disinflate demand and slow die economy down . That is what we must do today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can achieve vigorous growth in the ' 70s . Unfortunately , overcoming today 's inflation will not be easy , because we have inherited from the ' 6os , l notoriously bad case of the disease , by U.S. standards . Currently , the cost of living is rising about 5 percent a year ? higher than any recent period except the years just after World War II and one year during the Korean War . When the weekly earnings of American workers are adjusted for inflation and taxes , the wage earner is no better off today than three years ago , despite the fact that his money earnings have gone up 15 to 20 percent . Considering the nature and extent of today 's inflation , the measures to overcome it will have to be stern , and they will have to be continued for a considerable period ? certainly well into this year and even beyond . What these measures should be is another matter . Economics is by no means an exact science . But it seems clear that an effective antiinflation program should include : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming fiscal year at least as tight as the present limit , which allows the budget to increase by only 5 percent ; ( 2 ) extension of the surtax into 1970 at the 5-percent rate requested by the Administration ( though it would have been better to continue a 10-percent rate ) ; ( 3 ) a continuation of tight money for an additional period ( rather than an immediate relaxation , as some propose ) . To lift restraints prematurely would bankrupt the whole antiinflation effort . I would also favor federal action in two other directions : First , the federal government should be certain that it conducts its own affairs in a non-inflationary  | manner . Steps should be taken to bring into harmony with the antiinflation program those activities of government that directly affect costs and prices . These include federal employment and pay policies ; purchasing , procurement and construction ; minimum-wage determinations on jobs involving federal procurement and construction ; and the wide-ranging activities of government in direct lending and loan insurance . A program to bring these varied government activities under close and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Government Activities Affecting Costs and Prices , which operated in the final years of the Eisenhower Administration . Second , there must , of course , be a special effort to assure that all desirable actions are taken ? by federal , state and local governments , and by private individuals and groups ? to ease the impact of the anti-inflation program on individuals . Government actions that can be helpful include unemployment compensation , job training and placement . An anti-inflation program of this scope and character is bound to work ? but it would be a mistake to expect it to work instantly . Even a program of severe restraints will take time ? six months , at least ? to make itself felt . In the meantime both prices and unemployment will continue to rise as the economy slows . This is the " awkward period " in the stabilization process , whe one inherits the worst elements o all possible worlds . Will this stabilization process involve recession ? In the ' 50s , trouble . some inflation was overcome in the second half of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one in 1957-58 , and a mild one i 196o-61 . But this time , though there is no certainty , we can be somewha more optimistic . With the right mi of policies , moderation and gradual ism have a fair chance of accomplish ing disinflation without recession . But there is a risk , too ? the risk that the program will be so diluted and so gradual that it will never get an adequate grip on inflation . The end result , in that case , could be merely to prolong slow growth for an extended period , thus dimming America 's expectations for the ' 70s . These are the main economic problems , policy options and policy risks as we enter the ' 70s . There is no choice but to grasp the nettle . Inflation has to be overcome , and overcoming it has to be our first order of business in domestic policy . This is an essential preliminary to putting the American economy back on the path of vigorous growth . @#            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
