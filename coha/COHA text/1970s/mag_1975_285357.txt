Nelson Rockefeller is a commuter Vice President , shuttling frequently between Washington and New York in his private jet . Not before the end of the school year will he move his wife Happy and their two young sons to the capital city . But he never makes the trip home without taking along several top aides and a hefty leather bag , which is stuffed with up to 45 Ibs. of vice-presidential paper work . <P> The homework is a token of Rockefeller 's approach to his new job . He had hardly settled in his office in the Old Executive Office Building before he was characteristically charging ahead . Among other things , he has assembled a staff of about 30 , most of them old associates who took salary cuts to follow him on to the federal payroll in Washington . He has held individual get-acquainted meetings with Cabinet members and other key Administration officials . He has launched the Administration 's investigation of the Central Intelligence Agency ( see story page 31 ) . <P> Partner in Full . Several times a day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet with citizens ' groups , to work with Administration members on details of President Ford 's forthcoming State of the Union message , or to talk about domestic matters with the President himself . Says a top Rockefeller aide : " Ford signed him on as a partner , and there is every sign that he means it in full . " <P> Mindful of his position as No. 2 , Rockefeller is careful to do nothing that might be interpreted as acting on his own or as upstaging Ford . Explains one associate : " Rockefeller is highly conscious of being helpful , but not pushing . " Adds another aide : " He understands very thoroughly that he is whatever the President says he is . " <P> Last week , after attending his first Ford Cabinet meeting , Rockefeller chatted for an hour with TIME Bureau Chief Hugh Sidey and Correspondent Bonnie Angelo . It was his first press interview as Vice President . Still unused to his new title , he slipped once in relating an anecdote and referred to himself as " the Governor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his role in Government or his relationship with Ford . Pressing two fingers together , he declared : " We 're like that . " The circumspect Rockefeller would not discuss foreign policy ( " That is not my field " ) . He also would not predict whether he would develop with Ford an overall concept of American life to serve as a framework for domestic policy , as Secretary of State Henry Kissinger has done for U.S. foreign policy . Said Rockefeller : " My hunch is that that is what the President is going to do , but we have n't had the tune to sit around and just chat or philosophize . " Highlights of the interview : <P> <P> Q. Americans seem to be drifting , or maybe searching for leadership . How are you going to turn this around ? Can you exert leadership from this office ? <P>
