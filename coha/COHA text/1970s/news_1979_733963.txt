txt The Carter administration . anxious to determine whether business is likely to comply with its wage-priceguidelines , broadened its request for corporate information . In issuing fmal procedural rules concerning the anti-inflation program , the Council on Wage and Price Stability requested that companies with net revenue of $250 million or more in their most recent fiscal year notify the government before Feb. 15 of their " organizational structure for purposes of compliance . " Basically , the government wants to know how corporations plan to treat " individual units " ? that is , subsidiaries and divisions ? in reporting the price and profit information the council needs to determine whether a company is complying with the anti-inflation program . The submission of this material on " organizational structure " will be viewed by the government as an indication that the company intends to abide by the voluntary wage-price standards , Barry Bosworth , council director , suggested . Organizational Data Until now , only companies with sales of $500 million or more had been asked to submit written information to the council , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ briefing that the expanded request covers only organizational information . As before , only concerns with annual sales of $500 million or more will be asked for detailed data on prices and profits . Government officials estimate that 1,000 to 1,200 companies will fall under the broadened reporting request . Of those companies , about 500 have annual revenue of $500 million or more and are being asked to supply detailed financial data . Basically , the anti-inflation program calls for companies to hold their price increases over the next year to 0.5 percentage point below their average annual rate of price increases during 1976-77 . It also calls for holding increases in wages and certain fringe benefits to 7% or less during the coming year . The procedural rules , which will be published in today 's Federal Register , spell out how the government will deal with noncompliance . The rules say : " If the council finds a company to be out of compliance , it shall . 11 days after its decision , place the company 's name on a list of noncomplying companies . This list @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before they 're put on the list , however , and they will be given 10 days to respond . A company wo n't be listed if the council is satisfied that " corrective action will be initiated promptly . " Government Contracts Mr. Bosworth said the list will also be made available to federal procurement agencies so they can deny government contracts in excess of $5 million to violators of the guidelines . Mr. Bosworth indicated that the list would be published shortly after March 31 . " A reasonable time to put out a list would be the end of the first six months " of the program , which began in early October , he said . Once a company on the noncompliance. . list has come into compliance , Its name will be removed from the list and " a notice to that effect will be published promptly , " the rules state . If a request for removal from the list is denied , the company may seek reconsideration from the wage-price agency . In these cases , the council may hold a hearing to consider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is requesting from concerns with annual sales of $500 million or more . These companies are asked to tell the council by Feb. 15 what their rate of price change was during the 1976-77 base period , to describe the method used to calculate this information , and to give weighted profit-margin data for the best two of the three fiscal years ended prior to Oct. 2 , 1978 . In addition , those large companies that are required to . file Form 10K annual reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission are requested to file copies of these reports with the wage-price council for each of the last three fiscal years and for the fiscal year ending during the " program year "  --  the year that began last October . Pay-Rate Changes Further , companies with 5,000 or more employes during any one calendar quarter of the most recent fiscal year are requested to submit to the council by Feb. 15 a description of the method to be used for determining pay-rate changes during the coming year . Also , those companies with annual sales of $500 million or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the price-deceleration standard must submit margin information to the council by Feb. 15 . This category includes wholesalers , retoilers and food manufacturing and processing companies . These companies are also asked to submit a description of the " actions that the company plans to take to assure that the standards will be met as the program year progresses . " In addition , companies with annual sales of $500 million or more or with 1,000 or more employes are asked to seek the council 's approval before taking certain actions allowed by the guidelines . The purpose here is to avoid giving the appearance that the company is n't complying . Actions covered by this provision include deducting from the pay-raise calculations a portion of an increase because of productivity gains ; a pay raise in excess of the 7% standard because of acute labor shortages , or a pay raise in excess of the standard based on a " tandem " relationship , in which one group of workers ' pay normally follows that of another group . The council wants companies taking any of these actions to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The council will also determine when meeting the standards would constitute undue hardship or gross inequity . The rules define undue hardship as a situation " that seriously threatens the financial viability of a company , " and gross inequity as a situation that " is manifestly unfair . " Mr. Bosworth said that the council lacks adequate manpower to consider individual cases . Thus , he is looking for " categories of situations , " such as companies that have extremely low profit margins or are losing money . Mr. Bosworth said a strike would n't be considered a hardship for a company , however . Requests for Exceptions Companies may request a conference with the wage-price agency regarding requests for exceptions to the standards . The council also said it will accept requests for a determination that a pay or price action is consistent with the allowable exceptions if the company expects to receive a government contract for which it must certify compliance with the program or if it reaches a labor settlement contingent upon the council 's finding that the settlement does n't violate the standards . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will make a final determination within 20 days of the receipt of all information . The wage-price council said the procedural rules will be effective today without advance public comment . But it added that It will accept public comment and will make revisions " as may be appropriate . "
