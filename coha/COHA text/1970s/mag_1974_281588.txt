From No. 10 Downing Street last week came a long-expected announcement . Using the tradition-honed phrases , spokesmen for Prime Minister Harold Wilson declared that " Her Majesty has been graciously pleased to signify that she will comply " with his request to dissolve Parliament on Sept. 20 and hold elections on Oct. 10 . The campaign machinery instantly shifted into high gear . Party leaders appeared on television , and more than 2,000 candidates headed for the hustings to begin three weeks of intensive politicking . <P> British voters greeted Wilson 's announcement with about as much enthusiasm as they would show for a soccer game between two fourth-division losers . For them , the campaign must seem frustratingly dj vu . It was only seven months ago that they went to the same polls to vote for the same parties on what may appear to them to be the same issues . Britain 's problems , however , have grown considerably worse since then . The country not only faces what all party leaders agree is the worst economic crisis in 40 years , but also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could threaten the existence of parliamentary democracy . It is , in short , a crisis of Churchillian dimensions - but no Winston Churchill is in sight . Instead , the voters will choose as their next Prime Minister a tired and familiar old face : either cunning , pragmatic Laborite Wilson , 58 ; schoolmasterly bachelor Edward Heath , 58 , the Conservatives ' leader ; or likable but inexperienced Liberal Jeremy Thorpe , 45 , who is a very dark horse indeed . <P> The dissolution of the Wilson government-the shortest-lived British Parliament of this century-was a result of the electorate 's failure last February to give any party a majority in the House of Commons . Wilson , having led a minority government since then , is gambling that Labor will emerge from the elections in firm control of Parliament . Yet it is far from certain that any party will win a parliamentary majority . Polls last week gave Labor 42% of the vote , Conservatives 34% , and Liberals 20.5% , but another standoff is possible . <P> Britain can ill afford another minority government . More @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strength and confidence to confront the country 's economic problems : inflation approaching a rate of 20% annually , 700,000 unemployed now and an expected 1 million out of work next year ( 4% of the work force ) , a stock market that has plunged to a 16-year low , and a balance of payments deficit that could top $10 billion this year . <P> A Bank of England report last week cited some of the weaknesses that plague British corporations and could trigger a rash of bankruptcies : chronically low profit margins , diminished cash flow and tight money . Just as the bank 's report appeared , London 's financial community learned that Ferranti , a leading electronics and defense contractor , could not meet its obligations and had exhausted its lines of credit . Financiers in the City immediately began to worry about which company would be next .
