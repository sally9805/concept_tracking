When DDT first appeared in the U.S. in 1942 , it seemed almost like a miracle drug . Cheap and efficient , it destroyed pests , reduced such insect-borne diseases as malaria , and brought bumper harvests . But over the years scientists found disturbing evidence , first publicized in Rachel Carson 's Silent Spring , that DDT was harmful to animals too , and might threaten man as well . <P> After 17 months of weighing the evidence pro and con , Environmental Protection Administrator William D. Ruckelshaus announced his verdict last week : " DDT is an uncontrollable , durable chemical that persists in the aquatic and terrestrial environments . " Because it lasts so long , it can build up in fish and animals until it " may have a serious effect " on human beings . <P> With that , he imposed an almost total ban on the pesticide ( exceptions : in cases of sudden epidemic , when DDT is the most effective means of combatting disease-carrying insects ; shipment to countries where malaria is a problem ; and use on onions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particularly vulnerable to pests ) . The ban will not go into effect until the end of the year , allowing time to train farmers in using DOT 'S chief substitute , methyl parathion , which is highly toxic but breaks down soon after being used . <P> The ban was immediately challenged in suits filed by the manufacturer and processors of DDT . Another challenge came from the Environmental Defense Fund , which has been chiefly responsible for forcing the issue . It filed a court petition asking that the ban go into effect immediately and that it forbid all domestic applications of the onetime miracle . -
