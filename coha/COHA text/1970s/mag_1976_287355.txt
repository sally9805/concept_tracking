The stock market is the most sensitive barometer of investor attitudes , and it has reacted to Jimmy Carter 's election with a minicrash . During the first eight trading days since the vote , the Dow Jones industrial average plummeted more than 38 points , to a close of 927.69 , the lowest since last January . Though stock traders have had other things to worry about-primarily the slowdown in the economy-the chief reason for the sell-off appears to be fear that Carter 's programs to speed up the economy will set off a new burst of inflation . <P> Talks with leading businessmen around the country indicate , however , that in this case the stock market has been oversensitive to the point of neurosis . Among dozens of executives interviewed by TIME correspondents , few were nearly as frightened as the plunge on Wall Street might lead a headline reader to believe . To the contrary , though the business community voted solidly for Ford , executives are taking a relaxed , wait-and-see attitude toward the forthcoming Carter Administration . They hope that the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that his populist oratory during the campaign will not be followed by any significant anti-business action . <P> The most important indication of the business mood is that , whatever stock market investors may think , corporate chiefs are not cutting back on the vital investments that they make in new plant and equipment . " We made our plans , and they have n't changed , " says Joel Goldberg , president of Rich 's , a chain of 12 department stores , which has its headquarters in Atlanta . Speaking to shareholders in Boston last week , U.S. Steel Chairman Edgar Speer declared that his company would go ahead with plans to spend about $900 million in 1977 . Somewhat similar statements came from J.C . Penney and American Electric Power . <P> A number of industrialists are outright bullish about the Carter victory , which at least ended a long period of uncertainty . " The election put me in a good mood , " says Earle W. Pitt , president of Foxboro Co. , a Massachusetts electronics manufacturer . " We are looking at good times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Republican , Pitt says that " deep down I feel that Carter 's been a businessman himself , and I guess I do n't expect him to go off the deep end . " <P> Businessmen do , nevertheless , have reservations and worries about the President-elect . They center on four issues : <P> Wage-price policy . Carter is committed to more active federal intervention in wage and price decisions . Initially , at least , he probably will start with relatively mild jawboning ; he said during his last television debate with Ford that he would call corporate and labor leaders together to work out voluntary guidelines for pay and price boosts . But businessmen have not forgotten that early in the campaign Carter spoke of requesting stand-by authority to impose wage-price controls , which executives abhor . Says Raymond Herzog , president of 3M : " The mere mention of federal intervention causes companies to raise their prices in anticipation . Inflation would spiral . Carter should go on the record to stop these rumors. "             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
