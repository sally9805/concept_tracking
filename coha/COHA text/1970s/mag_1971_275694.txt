Apart from the jocular jottings of Columnist Russell Baker , the New York Times is not noted for its humor . Some delightful deadpan gave a lift to its front page last week , however , when Music Critic Harold Schonberg was , as it were , thrown to the wolves . <P> The man responsible was Metropolitan Editor Arthur Gelb , who spotted an offbeat story in the monthly magazine of Manhattan 's Museum of Natural History ; the article concluded that wolves howled not to frighten people but to communicate with other wolves . Gelb assigned Schonberg to write a professional critique of the calls of the wild . After listening to nearly an hour 's worth of howling , Schonberg issued his straight-faced findings , complete with notational diagram : <P> &gt; Wolves sing . &gt; There are lupine vocal registers-soprano wolves , contralto wolves , tenor wolves , even a bass wolf or two . &gt; Wolves have a characteristic call in which the interval of the major sixth ( C to A ) predominates . <P> Schonberg further observed that " when one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Di quella pira ' from 11 Trovatore , the rest of the wolves join in , as in the choral sections of ' Di quella pira . ' " He found that the best wolf virtuosos " start pianissimo , swell to a messa di voce to the sixth above , hold it sweetly and purely , then perhaps embellish to the upper partial before going down to a pianissimo and trailing off on an inconclusive microtonality near the tonic . " Although some wolves have a range of more than an octave , Schonberg noted that " they try to trill , poor things , but do not really have the technique for it . " <P> Story finished , Schonberg treated startled staffers in the Times city room to a few tenor and bass wolf howls of his own . Not bad , Gelb noted .
