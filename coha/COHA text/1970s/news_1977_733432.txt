txt Sweeping laws to establish and enforce high standards of practice for doctors and hospitals in New York State , including periodic relicensing reviews for physicians , have been proposed by a legislative panel that has been investigating incompetent and unnecessary medical care . A doctor found , for example , to have performed unnecessary surgery on a frequent basis would be subject to the loss of his license to practice , a license now issued for life . Speaker Stanley Steingut , Democrat of Brooklyn , who created the Assembly 's Medical Practice Task Force a year ago , is expected to sponsor the legislation soon after the Legislature reconvenes in January . The laws would make New York the first state in the nation to take a bewildering variety of medical and hospital monitoring programs and place them ' under a single set of standards and under a single authority with power to eliminate duplicative and sometimes conflicting regulatory criteria . Board Would Set Standards The major legislative action proposed by the task force is the creation of a State Board for the Assessment of Quality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ representatives from organized medicine , medical schools , the health insurance industry and the public , would establish standards of what constituted proper medical and hospital care and then see that those standards were enforced by existing monitoring bodies . Standards , in this case , include a variety of criteria for determining , for example , whether any given type of surgery is warranted or how long someone should he hospitalized for a given disease . They also include such things as the amount of training required of nurses , safeguards e. , inst tampering with medical records and rules governing who may assist a surgeon in an operating room . The task force is the same body that // has disclosed numerous instances in which surgical-supply salesmen have participated in operations . In a policy paper , the task force contends that the laws are necessary because existing standards and enforcement procedures are not consistently high and effective . The paper , a copy of which was obtained by The New ' York Times , was prepared by the task force director , Matthew L. Lifflander , and sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for his comments . Although standards now exist for determining when to perform a tonsillectomy , for example , they are often not enforced . Some surgeons use diagnostic criteria that are not founded on scientific evidence or perform unneeded operations because they want to make more money . Under the present system , even if such unnecessary operations are identified , nothing is usually done about them . Under the proposed system , the surgeon would be unable to collect from anyone for the operation and his record would note the incident . When his medical license came up for renewal , if the new system is enacted , a pattern of substandard care could be cause for the state to refuse to renew the license . No medical expert not connected with the task force has had time to review the proposal . Dr. Lowell Bellin , former New York City Health Commissioner and now an officer of a Manhattan body that monitors medical care , said that although he had not seen the proposals , they sounded " noble . " He added , however , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and come to nothing . " After a while , one develops a certain degree of skepticism about this , " Dr. Bellin said . " It sounds noble , but the concern I would have is that you would place an enormous amount of authority in a small group of people . " In addition to Mr. Steingut 's backing , the legislative package is also expected to have the support of the three Assembly committee chairmen , all Democrats , who are co-chairmen of the task force . They are Assemblyman Alan G. Hevesi Democrat of Queens , chairman of the Health Committee ; Assemblyman Melvin H. Miller , Democrat of Brooklyn , chairman of the Committee on Higher Education ; and Assemblyman Vincent F. Nicolosi , Democrat of Queens , chairman of the Insurance Committee . Among the major medicat monitoring bodies now operating in New York , according to the task force paper are : gThe federally mandated Professional Standards Review Organizations , which gather volumes of data but , with rare exceptions , do not affect the level of care . gThe state 's " on-site @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often duplicating P.S.R.O.'s. gThe New York State Hospitalization Review , a statistical reporting system intended to control costs but which appears to cost more than it saves . gThe Medicaid Management Information System , which , by spotting fraudulent billings from doctors , has saved more than it costs . gThe state 's Hospital Survey , whose intended biennial inspections often come five years apart and with little consequence to hospitals that fail . 9Hospital " peer review " committees intended to oversee various activities in each hospital but which often yield to peer pressure rather than discipline or educate errant colleagues . gThe Joint Commission on Hospital Accreditation , an industry - supported group whose inspection reports are often accepted by governments in lieu of government inspections. ( 5Audits by health insurance companies trying to cut costs or document requests for rate increases . According to the Hospital Association of New York , 164 types of Federal , state and local regulating agencies have jurisdiction over hospitals in the state . Individual facets of hospital activity must often be inspected by or reported ? to a dozen or more agencies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposed board would , according to the policy paper , have power to eliminate much of the duplication , assigning to the major monitoring agencies those areas of responsibility most appropriate to the agency . " What is intended here , " the paper says , " is to preserve those aspects of the system that work , to enhance their capacity by implementing some new procedures , to eliminate the duplications and to reorganize their administration to make them more effective and responsible . " The proposed board would also have the responsibility of seeing that the regulatory agencies enforced the standards . According to the paper , a new Federal law allows states to establish standards to be used in the federally financed program of the Professional Standard Review Organizations and allows states to monitor the organization 's performance . Incompetent or fraudulent care discovered through the new system would be reported to licensing and disciplinary authorities for appropriate action . Also part of tthe proposed legislative package is a bill that would require hospitals to charge commercial health insurance companies the same amount for services as they charge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sample of New York hospitals was charging Blue Cross patients an average daily rate of 5185 while charging commercially insured or uninsured patients S262 a day . Another proposed bill would require all health insurance companies to adopt the assessment board 's standards and audit the quality of care being delivered to insured patients . Substandard care would be reported to the board to consider in disciplining the doctor . Under the proposed bill , an insurance company could contract with a P.S.R.O. or other existing body to carry out the quality assessment . Recognizing that it was proposing a massive and complex program , the paper says implementing everything " will require the common effort and s.:pport of the medical profession , the insurance industry . the entire health care industry , labor and management and the executive and legislative branches of government . " The paper says the task force will hold a number of public hearings on the legislation next year and seek comment from all interested parties .                   @ @
