Not since 1888 has the Northeast suffered such a winter storm <P> Buffeted by winds of up to 110 m.p.h. , a 42-ft . Coast Guard pilot boat , the Can Do , capsized and sank in Salem Harbor . The captain and the four-man crew were drowned . In nearby Nahant , Melvin Demit , 61 , was lighting the furnace in his basement , when a wall of water crashed into his house and engulfed him . In Scituate , a raging sea swept five-year-old Amy Lanzikos to her death just as a rescue boat was bringing her to safety . <P> This was the scene along the Massachusetts coast last week , as a mammoth blizzard-the worst since 1888-slammed the Northeast , dropping from 1 to 4 ft. of snow in the latest blast from a whiter of stormy discontent . Raging from Virginia to Maine , the hurricane-like storm killed at least 56 people , caused an estimated half billion dollars ' worth of damage and crippled Connecticut , Massachusetts and Rhode Island for five days . <P> Providence was particularly hard hit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ J. Joseph Garrahy ordered all Rhode Island businesses , except for grocery stores , to close . Not until this week was the state expected to return to normal . By comparison , the blizzard left New York City paralyzed for a mere 24 hours and entirely spared the Midwest , which was still digging out from a late January blizzard , that region 's worst in a century . <P> At first , for the fortunate majority , last week 's storm could be taken in good spirits and looked on as a welcome holiday . Cross-country skiers glided through city streets . Fraternity men tossed snowballs at sorority women on Boston 's Commonwealth Avenue . Crowds applauded the impromptu performances of jugglers and clowns on Boston Common . At Boston Garden , some 11,000 fans showed up during the storm for college hockey playoffs . Many fans could not get home afterward and , sustained by free coffee and hot dogs , bunked down on the wooden seats . <P> Then the situation in Boston worsened . Two power blackouts cut off electricity for 100,000 people at the height @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broke out . Long lines formed at the few food markets that could open , and shelves were quickly stripped bare of milk , bread , potato chips , ginger ale-almost anything edible . Not until two days after the storm , when the major highways were finally cleared , could the city be resupplied with food .
