From San Francisco Bureau Chief Joseph Boyce : <P> From the lush San Joaquin Valley in California to the Rocky Mountains , much of the West is suffering from severe drought . Worst hit is California , where the lack of significant rainfall since the autumn of 1975 cost farmers and ranchers an estimated $437 million last year , and snowless ski resorts have lost $7 million so far this season . <P> Of course , no new Administration can be expected to provide relief from the choking dust and cloudless skies . But Westerners are looking for at least some help from Washington in protecting their lands and livelihood . Said Ron Francis , director of the Denver-based American National Cattlemen 's Association : " We are against Government support in general . We support the law of supply and demand , but we need price support and emergency livestock loans . " In Douglas County , Wash. , Rancher Gary Dalin swelled with pride because his 16-year-old daughter Heidi had just been named local Beef Princess . But in other respects he bemoaned the farmer 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begins to get a little better , we 're seeing cows coming in from Canada and Mexico and frozen beef from Australia . " <P> If ranchers and farmers want Jimmy Carter 's Administration to help in some areas , they emphatically want it to leave them alone in others . Outside Del Rey . Calif .. Harold Shidan , 57 , a stocky raisin grower , faulted Carter for endorsing the state 's unsuccessful attempt to settle the three-way labor battle between the growers , the Teamsters Union and Cesar Chavez 's United Farm Workers . The proposal that Carter supported would have permitted union organizers to campaign on growers ' property and would have mandated secret elections for union representation . Shidan griped that he has had to pull up seven acres of plum trees because , at $2.75 per hr. for a migrant worker 's labor , he could not afford to harvest them . " The politicians should stay out of it . " <P> Other farmers want the Federal Government to ease up on land-use controls . This view is not shared by another powerful Western @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the West are owned by the Federal Government-up to 85% of Nevada - Bill Press , director of California 's Office of Planning and Research , declared . " There is a need for the Government to get its own house in order : forest , grazing land and desert . As of now , the Feds have no real land-management policy . " <P> Second only to drought as a major worry , both on and off the farms , is the economy . Hamilton Cloud . 24. a black Yale graduate who earns less than $12,000 a year as a radio producer in Los Angeles , complained that he can not afford to get married because of inflation . Said he : " I 'm still getting used to the idea that things will never be cheaper than they are now . " Other people in the West voice the almost universal American litany of worries : street crime , poverty and unemployment . <P> No sensible Westerner expects Carter to solve these problems in four or even eight years . Besides , the West was solid Ford country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and yet growing optimism permeates the region . " The state of the nation is good . " said Dan Evans , the outgoing Governor of Washington . " The federal system is returning to the concepts of our forefathers . "
