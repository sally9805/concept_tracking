Champion of Powerless People Mondale of Minnesota by Robert Coles Minnesota in recent years has done rather well in Washington . Within the past three years two of the state 's sons have joined the Supreme Court , one as Chief Justice ; and in 1968 the state 's two senators fought for the Democratic presidential nomination . Hubert Humphrey and Eugene McCarthy were sent to Congress and kept there by the people rooted in the Granger movement of the 1870s , in the Farmers Alliance and the Populist Party , in the effort of small landowners and workers of the Midwest to fight the economic and political power of Eastern banks and corporations . Both parties in Minnesota have responded to that populist tradition : the Democrats with men like Humphrey and McCarthy ; the Republicans with men like Charles Lindbergh 's father , a strongly progressive congressman from the state 's sixth district , former governor Harold Stassen , and most recently , former senator Edward Thye , who back in the forties and fifties was a vigorous internationalist , a champion of federal aid to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ racial segregation . Walter F. Mondale took over Hubert Humphrey 's seat in the Democratic landslide of 1964 . He was then 36 , had been attorney general of Minnesota , and before that active in the state 's Democratic and Farmer-Labor parties , which successfully bring together ( in contrast , say , to what happens in Nebraska or Indiana ) the workers of St. Paul and Minneapolis and Duluth and the rural people who predominate in the hundreds of villages and small towns that stretch from the Iowa state line to the Canadian border . Right off Senator Mondale showed his inclinations . He chose , out of a number of possibilities , membership on the Senate 's subcommittee on Housing and Urban Affairs . He has since joined an interesting group of subcommittees which do not have the political clout and power of the Judiciary Committee or the Armed Services Committee but have insistently and skillfully revealed how very much needs to be done if a wealthy United States is going to be just and free . The names of the subcommittees tell a story of our continuing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was for a time chairman ; Education ; Employment , Manpower and Poverty ; Indian Education ; Labor ; Retirement and the Individual , of which he has also been the chairman ; Housing for the Elderly ; Consumer Interests of the Elderly ; Health of the Elderly ; and finally the Select Committee on Nutrition and Human Needs and the Select Committee on Equal Educational Opportunity , of which he is now the chairman . Mondale is an active , outgoing , attractive , and unusually intelligent man , who does not need legislative aides and administrative assistants to tell him what to say , what to do , or how to vote . His concerns are not shared by powerful lobbyists , or members d the military-industrial complex ? all of whom have other things to do than worry about how , for instance , thousands of migrant children get along as they are dragged all over America , and at 10 or 12 or 13 set to work picking crops . " I am concerned with powerlessness , " the senator begins bluntly when he speaks to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has said for the record many times in the course of hearings held by his subcommittee on Migratory Labor : " I do n't believe the American people really know just how impoverished and hungry and above all powerless so many of their fellow citizens are ? not only in the urban ghettos , but in the rural areas , where migrants like the people I 've heard testify before our committee live by the hundreds and hundreds of thousands . They move all over . They belong nowhere . They do n't vote . Often their children do n't even go to a school . It 's a disgrace , and it 's even more of a disgrace that the public does n't know what 's going on , because such conditions are not considered ' news . ' These people just go on being exploited . They are paid less than other workers and they do the hardest work imaginable . I have tried to find out for myself how migrants live , and I want to help them ? really help them , not urge band-aids for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the problem and talk about ' increased benefits ' for them . Sure they need medical care and schools that even half take notice of their children ; but the real problem is that migrants ( and maybe a lot of other people , too ) are powerless , which means they have no real say in what happens to them . They do n't get the protection of a whole group of laws we enacted in the thirties to protect the working man , to guarantee him collective bargaining rights and a minimum wage and unemployment compensation and all the rest . This committee 's job is to document all that . " Mondale knew about migrant workers long before he came to the Senate . As a youth he worked his way through college in canning factories and out in the rich farmland of Minnesota , where he saw first-hand how migrants lived . He lived with them and eventually began to organize them : " That was something you do n't forget . I guess every working man has heard those kinds of stories , even if now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll never forget how quickly it all happened : we asked for better wages , and a little money to tide us over , because the summer was unusually wet , and the crops could n't be harvested for a while and the migrants were left sitting around with no money , nothing . The next thing we knew they were all packed up and shipped South , , like so much bad merchandise . They were ' troublemakers/ , ' and I guess I was too , for trying to organize them . We did n't get far that summer , but you have to keep trying . My father was a Methodist minister , and when I was a boy he taught us to care , to be concerned about social problems , and not to give up easily . We were fortunate to be in a state like Minnesota . In the finest of the small towns ? in Ceylon , for example , where I was born ? people are ultimately affected by the way Americans live up a hollow in Appalachia or on an Indian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The senator has seen what goes on along the Mexican border . At six in the morning one day a couple of years ago he had been watching Mexicans cross into Southern California for hours . Finally a US Customs official told him to " get out of here . " Mondale looked like a tramp , or a troublemaker . He had on khaki pants and an old sweater and a sports shirt . When told to leave he refused . He was then asked to identify himself . The long lines of Mexican nationals were then stopped , and their credentials checked . The senator has no illusions , however , that anything short of new laws will stop what he describes : " At one in the morning they start crossing the border , and at two in the morning American farm foremen start signing them up on the streets of those border towns . By three you can see the buses and trucks driving farther into California or Texas , and by five or six they 're working . You ca n't blame the Mexicans ; they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country , and I met some in our country working for 60 or 70 cents an hour , way below the minimum wage . What it all amounts to is very simple : American farm workers are undercut ? in several ways . Their wages are undercut by foreign labor ; just as important , they ca n't bargain with owners when all the owners have to do is bring in hungry , docile , frightened Mexican workers . The problem of the migrant workers wo n't be solved until we close that Mexican border to imported , underpaid farm labor . No union in America could survive that ? the use of foreigners by a company whenever it finds domestic workers too ' demanding . ' And now Mr. Nixon and Mr. Mitchell have emphasized that they will try to close the Mexican border alright ? to drugs . " Mondale has marched with California 's United Farm Workers to the Mexican border in protest against the hiring of Mexican labor to break the strike Cesar Chavez and his men worked so long and hard to make effective . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indians and Eskimos live , or rather , barely survive . He and his wife have gone on a " welfare diet , " eating only what poor people on welfare can afford to eat : " I went on that diet and I went to the border to see , to feel , to be there , to experience what is going on , rather than read about it . A lot of people , well-meaning people , never know how it really goes for the poor ? down along the Mexican border , or in the cities or out in the countryside , too . That 's why I 've wanted to take our Senate investigations out of Washington ? and also , bring the workers themselves to the hearing rooms of government buildings . It 's very hard , though ; you hear heart-breaking testimony , and you wonder how the public can be told about what you and your staff have found ? how these very poor and hurt people live and try to get by , against overwhelming odds . And , of course , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mondale 's office has in recent years sent out one after another remarkable law to the Senate floor . He sponsored the bill , vetoed December 9 by President Nixon , to create an effective " child development program , " one that would commit billions of dollars for " needed health care , nutritional aid , educational assistance , and social services . " ( The text of the bill provided a long and first-rate description of what hunger and poverty do to children psychologically and physiologically . ) He has asked for an annual " social report " that would do for health and education what has long been done with the nation 's business and commerce by the President 's Council of Economic Advisers . He has proposed that the various legal services programs for the poor be given much more money and the kind of organizational and administrative protection they will need if they are to continue working for penniless clients , who have complaints against people rich enough not only to hire good lawyers , but exert all sorts of pressures on governors , congressmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went to Vail , Colorado , during the Senate 's August vacation , to meet with some hundred lawyers from local offices of the OED 's Neighborhood Legal Service Project who feared that offices set up to help Navaho Indians , migrant workers in Florida and California , and ghetto residents were in serious jeopardy . On Vietnam , Mondale is candid " I came to the Senate in 1964 and did n't know much about Asia and Vietnam , like many others here in Washington at that time . I supported the President at first . In all honesty I think I was wrong , and over the past few years I 've said why . I guess I began to wonder what was really going on there in 1966 , and that 's why I went to Vietnam then . I became more and more concerned as I listened to the growing dissent of people I respected very much . I eventually became totally convinced that this country has been terribly hurt by that war ; not only have we lost men and wealth , but our whole sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the worse . In recent years I have spent hours with students all over the country , and I believe I 've heard and responded to their message ; they see us in a moral and political swamp , full of corruption , intrigue , and worse . I think over time a lot of us came to see that ? but it took us too much time , much too much . " He worries about the future . Are we headed for years and years of conservative rule , with high military budgets and stingy , if well-advertised domestic expenditures for what he calls our " human needs " ? He can range wide and eloquent on the subject : " I do n't believe the people ' want a stop to the progres23 sive legislation we 've put through since 1933 . Yes , you have the backlash , and the fear of the ordinary worker that he 's being left out . He is , too . He needs more efficient and less expensive ? less ruinous , if the illness is serious ? medical care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from products that are useless or dangerous . He deserves a tax system that gives him as much consideration as the oil industry or , a millionaire who somehow ends up paying nothing to the government every April 15 . I 've talked in union halls , to steelworkers , to men and women who work hard all day and try desperately to make ends meet and have a little left over for a vacation or maybe some repairs on the house . They 're not fed up with the thought of more social legislation . They know what they want and need . I 'll start talking about some of these problems and they wo n't let me go . The problem is that we 've talked a lot about changing things , about fighting poverty and improving our national life ? but we 've voted a pittance of money to achieve these goals . Then we turn around and say the people are ' fed up , ' and of course they are ? at a lot of words that are n't backed up by concrete , well-subsidized action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that they can be brought together on negative promises : we wo n't bother you on school desegregation ; we wo n't ask you to do this or that for the next guy . People will get wise to that kind of appeal after a while . They can be scared and frustrated , but if my party keeps saying what it 's for , not against , ? the majority of the American people will listen , as they have in the past . " Mondale keeps on trying : " Three minutes after we launched our men to the moon from Cape Kennedy I banged the gavel here in Washington to open hearings on the miserable conditions of the blueberry pickers in eastern North Carolina . I was proud to be in Washington that day , holding those hearings . The pickers were out on strike , and we thought we should listen to their complaints . Perhaps we belong on the moon , but we surely belong there , in North Carolina , aiding such workers ? belong there with all the resources the nation could mobilize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are times when the mind dreams of what it would be like if an effective majority of the Senate shared Senator Mondale 's concerns , and if the President of the United States did , too . One can also wonder how the American working man would respond to a presidential candidate like Mondale . But most senators like him , senators who carry on the populist tradition , stand little chance of heading a national ticket . They are apt to be without means , they speak too bluntly , they show a deeply felt compassion that gets them nowhere with lobbyists and tends to turn off ' many of those rich " backers " who decide for their own ' reasons whether a. candidate will ever have a chance to get going and stay going .
