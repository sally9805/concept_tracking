Normun Rockwell painted his first cover for The Saturday Evening Post in 1916. it was typical Rockwell . A boy , overdressed in the sissy style legend holds that all mothers adore and all boys abhor , is pushing a perambulator with an infant in it . Protruding from the breast pocket of his jacket is a rubber-nippled bottle of milk . Passing in the opposite direction , on their way to the ball park , are two urchins of the same age in baseball uniforms . One lifts a mocking pinkie at our suffering friend with the baby carriage . The other laughs in rowdy delight at his discomfiture . They know he would fight for his honor if he could , but he ca n't ? not with that baby to watch , and the milk to be fed on the dot , according to orders from his home base . Like the entire parade of Rockwell covers since , appearing on The Saturday Evening Post until they have become an entire landmark of Americana in themselves , this first cover had all of the Rockwell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human warmth that touches the hearts of all ; the gentle touch of caricature , ever so sly but never malicious . Be was to paint serious and inspiring subjects as well , when a great depth of characterization was to replace the humor . But the sure touch was never to waver . The keen eyes saw into the souls of men , and the artist 's slender hands created a world that will never fade while his canvases survive . That was the world of The Saturday Evening Post . All of America , and all of its heartaches and joy and wonder captured by the genius of this one man and marching down through the years ? from ' 16 down to this issue you hold in your hand ? on the covers of one magazine . That was the world , then , that was hawked by generations of Post boys who wore their bagsslung over the shoulder as a badge of pride and " moxie " ? the name of a now-forgotten soft drink which came to stand for energy , courage , with just a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sale just when all seemed lost . So it was only appropriate when the time came to create the cover of this 1971 edition of The Saturday Evening Post , that the mountain should move at last to ? Mahomet , and the editors of the magazine should journey to honor the man who in his lifetime had come to personify the magazine , and to work with him in the fastnesses of his classic home and studio in Stockbridge , high in the Berkshire Hills of Massachusetts . And it was also fitting that on this newest of Rockwellian covers there should appear a small boy ? complete with red hair , freckles , and a missing tooth ; a true mixture of snails and puppy dogs ' tails , part angel and part devil ? and so theeditors found such a boy in Indianapolis and took him with them to unite this symbol of young America with the septuagenarian artist who had already sketched entire battalions of such small boys , each uniquely himself and still allboys-in-one . Bryan is his name . And Bryan is just a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than even a Booth Tarkington to write about the inner heart of such a boy . What can you say ? That there is still something of the baby clinging to him , but if you take his hand or try to cuddle him that you may get a biff on the nose ? That Bryan has never been atvay from his parents and his older brother and sister for even one night , much less ever set foot in a jet aircraft ? Well , then do n't say it . For Bryan is that curious phenomenon , a child of the electronic age , to whom boarding a jet is ever so much more natural even than catching a bus  --  he has learned all about them from TV and he comes equipped with a built-in sound system to simulate a takeoff - a sequence of hmms , vrrrrrrrrrs , wannnggggggggs and eeeeennnngggggggs in rising intensity that would make an airline stewardess start to move trays around even in her sleep if f3ryan were supplying the audio from a couple of inches away . He is brave . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of five , the art director who is a father of three , and a man editor who once parachuted out of a fighter plane scarcely larger than a bathtub . But not one of them can do much more than fasten Bryan 's seat belt for him and hope that scooting along a rutted runway at something like two hundred miles an hour will strike this lad as not greatly faster than he is accustomed to in his dad 's Oldsmobile . And so all are relieved when Bryan reacts to the banshee wail of the three jets on the big 727 . He is not afraid : he is entranced . He is a true child of his age . Aerospace is his birthright . Bryan takes over the sky immediately . He recognizes that clouds , seen from above , are whipped cream . That rivers are mere scratches with a ball-point pen . He looks at the enormous wing of the plane , the ultimate in the engineering skills of man , and asks with the frighteningly direct candor of his years what would happen if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receiving end of Bryan 's blue-eyed look , straight as an arrow just leaving the bow , can only mumble the truth . Bryan nods gravely and looks at the earth below . " It 's a long way down , " he says , and Orville Wright himself could not have put it better ... or cared less . The trip to New York City is short enough in terms of time and then the party shifts to a smaller plane , a two-engined prop job that possibly might seat twenty if they were midgets , and which sits on the runway like a mosquito among hawks and condors . But it flies , and Bryan is even more entranced than before . The jet , after all , was only a boxcar that screams . This is more like it . The pilot is right up there close , and gaining altitude is bumping your way upstairs . This kind of flying is closer to being a bird , says Bryan . They land at Pittsfield . Winter still has New England in its grip and the snow is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the little plane , Bryan embarks on a career of snowball throwing that he is not to relinquish until he returns to Indiana . This is Berkshire country ? not exactly mountains as they would say it around the Tetons down Wyoming way , but still a flange of the Appalachians , with a wild look to the hills and every now and then a rocky peak , ancient and gnarled . This is handsome country , the peaks running in chains with deep valleys between , fertile and firred and lush , curved to the oxbows of meandering streams and rivers . The car taking them to Stockbridge from the Pittsfield airport tools through miles of unsettled country , where the blood of settlers tainted the brooks not really very long ago , as the Indians gave them their own kind of welcome . The adults , like most Americans suddenly arrived in New England , even if they have never been there before , feel as if they were back home at last . The man editor sees slopes he skied over as a boy , long ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own brand of mystic experience : His fingers itch to dip into the thousand million snowballs lying over the landscape , unflung . Now t hey reach Stockbridge . Straight out of a Norman Rockwell painting , t he white frame houses light up the evening snow like Christmas cards , and Main Street is the model for a thousand dreams . The hills look down serenely on the " Happy Valley " as this is traditionally called , and the Housatonic River marks the edge of town , mirroring the birches on its banks . The town has been thus since 1739 , and its population has now swollen to 2.417 inhabitants . We enter the Red Lion Inn , standing on the corner of the north-south pike as it has since 1773 . This is Mohican country . Stockbridge was once even called Indiantown . No wonder the Indianapolitans feel at home . The fire in the living room of the Inn says welcome to all . It is the same fireplace that once warmed five Presidents ? Cleveland , McKinley . Theodore Roosevelt , Coolidge and Franklin D. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wadsworth Longfellow . The tap water in the rooms is cold and clear and fresh as a mountain stream . Bryan , a true child of the city of the Big Indy " 500. " spreads his toy cars on the counterpane of his big double bed , talks a blue streak to his family over the phone , sighs two times after he hangs up , and falls asleep before he can take off his clothes . We are to meet Norman Rockwell at 8:30 A.M. , well along into the shank of the morning for him , since he habitually rises at five . The New England jams and jellies held us all too long at the breakfast table , and we soon learned that Stockbridge residents never point directly at a house when giving directions , but merely wave in the general direction of anything , a habit which led us to at least two un-Rockwellian doorways . After a few false starts , we reached the studio of the famous artist . Mr. and Mrs. Rockwell live in a classic white frame house close to the road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made into his studio . It overlooks a meadow which can not make up its mind whether it is a part of the Housatonic River , or merely a shelf of land running back from its west bank . We are joined now by the photographer from Chicago who made his own way on this pilgrimage , and veteran though he is , he shows little signs of agitation at the task before him ... what if the great painter is irascible or peremptory or autocratic and decides to run the show ? The minute we meet Norman Rockwell all such fears vanish . The man is all quiet charm . Aristocratic is the word . Slender in his seventy-seventh year , but with a tensile strength . Bryan is now in his newsboy attire , long stockings , knickerbockers and all . Oddly , he does not look to be in costume at all . His natural props ? freckles , red hair and the spunky way he walks and stands ? go well with thoughts of an earlier era . Norman Rockwell greets hint gravely and not smiling . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ innocence of childhood reach out across the gap of the years between them and obliterate it . This studio is Rockwell country indeed . When a man has a place all to himself - studio , or library , or workshop ? you can tell a lot about him just by looking around . Bryan gazes in open-mouthed delight at the tiny gilt angel suspended from the high studio ceiling , and then he points ecstatically at the ship model suspended high on the wall . The photographer hurries to set up his gear , and Mr. Rockwell surveys the scene in courtly silence . He seems at peace in his studio . There is his library of art books . Monet . El Greco . Twentieth Century Art From The Nelson Aldrich Rockefeller Collection . Jack Levine is on the shelf in between Caravaggio and the art treasures of The Louvre . This is a man of the world , virile and curious . There are weapons everywhere . A Winchester rifle with his nameplate on it . Flintlocks and ancient pistols . A curved kris . A holster and cartridge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , noble helmets from the heavy cavalry of Napoleonic wars . The shield , mace , and headgear , complete with steel webbing to protect the sides and back of the neck , that once adorned a Saracen warrior . Pipes , the Rockwell trademark , everywhere . Dolls from all over the world , the Far East , Eskimo country , Russia , Africa . Sleigh bells on the door , to jingle as you enter . A huge Russian samovar , filled with artist 's brushes . On the front of the studio , a high wall filled with Rockwell paintings . A fresh one on the floor , showing an animated scene at the Stockbridge firehouse . Echoes from the past : a postcard from the Nassau Inn , in Princeton , New Jersey , where Rockwell 's famous painting Yankee Doodle Went To Town adorns the wall of the taproom behind the bar . An up-to-the-second memento : a photograph of the crew of Apollo 11 , inscribed to Norman Rockwell and signed by Edward E. Aldrin , Neil Armstrong and Michael Collins . A mosaic sign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artist seats himself at his easel , and Bryan strikes a sturdy pose as The Saturday Evening Post salesboy . Time and the world fall away as Norman Rockwell sketches . The famous right hand begins its magic . On the studio wall , a tiny card holds a few lines by Yeats : An aged man is but a paltry thing , A tattered coat upon a stick , unless Soul clap its hands , and sing , and louder sing , For every tatter in its mortal dress . That says it all , in this wonderful place . Norman Rockwell is indefatigable . He strikes pose after pose for the photographer with uncomplaining patience . He jokes with Bryan . In one pose , the little boy stands behind the master , looking at the easel , and the small hand rests affectionately and unaffectedly on the famous man 's shoulder . Rockwell suggests a few settings . himself . The photographer is working like a dervish , fearful of the chance that fatigue might put an end to the sitting in every next minute . But it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take five " and Mr. Rockwell talks of the old days at the Post , when Editor George Horace Lorimer was king , and even the famous cover artist took orders from him and carried them out ? or else . Through the high skylight window , we look north towards the village through giant elms andbirches . A tiny porch on the west side of the studio perches over the meadow , a deer 's leap below . If a man could paint well anywhere , it would be here . Rockwell is back at his easel again , after shoptalk with our art director . The painter 's hand moves surely , even lovingly , as he outlines the figure of Bryan . Our photographer works at a madman 's pace , shutter and plates clicking like castanets , for he knows that at 11 A.M. Norman Rockwell will take his daily bicycle ride , come hell or Monsieur Daguerre himself . We take a last picture at the studio door , Bryan offering the Post to Norman Rockwell in what must surely be the sale of the century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such flurries as this Post crew brought to him . " You 're all just a whirlwind , " he says . The sleigh bells tinkle on the door as we go to the house itself , where our hostess Mrs. Rockwell is waiting . Mary ( " Molly " ) Punderson Rockwell . A timeless patrician beauty . She has the air of a queen in an ancient tale of chivalry , regal an fine andwarm . Her speaking voice is a kind of music which makes the rest of us sound like cackling geese . But after all , is not this the land where Melville wrote his Moby Dick , and Hawthorne his Tanglewood Tales ? Literature is in the very air of Stockbridge . And she is its handmaiden , a lady who taught the glories of the language at Milton Academy , and lives by them herself . Bryan is outside throwing his 10.000th snowball . but we others are captivated by the flawless taste and charm of the house . Priceless antiques , ancestor portraits on the walls , and sketches of the kids in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ books from ceiling to floor . And one of them , the Gaelic classic , The Crock of Gold , bespeaks the touch of the fey in Rockwell 's work . A modern painting by Rockwell 's son hangs over the library fireplace Even in this atmosphere of artistry . it is good . Mrs. Rockwell is reluctant to talk about herself , but she somewhat shyly brings out one of her treasures , a book presented to her by the students , graduates and faculty of Milton Academy upon her retirement . It is filled with poetry , drawings and funny sayings ? just one long love letter : Oh , Molly was retiring , In nineteen twenty-two , Retiring but inquiring , In everything she 'd do . Aspiring , and perspiring When some of us were tiring , And steadily acquiring , Skills worthy of a very few . But now when we 're admiring , This leader so inspiring ( apparently untiring ) Say ? why once more RETIRING ? Nay ! Please , it ca n't be true ! June 4 , 1959 . Dedicated to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ challenge Shakespeare , perhaps , but pure gold to the lady of that moment . She tells us how she met her husband . He was a student in a poetry class for adults presided over by Molly . Their thoughts rhymed , and that was that . Now they cycle together , and she winningly admits that perhaps this might be one keyto then joint longevity . Another would seem to be her multiple interests , among them being the President of the Old Corner House of The Stockbridge Historical Society , not an honorary title but one which carries plenty of work with it . Such as : it seems that the site of the Old Corner House , a classic little gem of 18th Century architecture , was owned by a local entrepreneur who proposed to raze the House and put up a supermarket in its place . He came this close : ? the lady who inhabits the house across the street actually had a screen of trees planted on her front lawn to shut off the sight of the desecration . But it never came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Old Corner House snatched the building from the maw of " Progress " and saved its storied rooms for posterity . And so the lady across the street enjoys her view unspoiled ... and has her trees , besides . The Old Corner House not only holds historic memorabilia of the area but also the only Rockwell paintings grouped for public display . His first Post cover is there . The famous Four Freedoms . And among the other familiar subjects are a few which might even surprise students of Rockwelliana . There is also an amusing color photograph on the walls of the House showing a re-enactment of the first incorporation of the A scene of patrician elegance : Mrs. Rockwell pauses in her dining room . // 2 7 Village by four of the Stockbridge worthies of today , resplendent in costume . A blanketed Indian in the picture , fierce of mien in his war paint , upon close inspection turns out to be Chief Rockwell himself . Bryan loves the display of paintings , perhaps because now Norman Rockwell has become something of a hero @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Visitors wander about in obvious pleasure . The names in the book of callers cover a wide range of states . One signature is in Japanese characters . The Old Corner House is a little American shrine , and you should promise yourself to go there soon if you can . Bryan 's path back to the Inn takes him unerringly to an old-fashioned country store on Main Street , where he makes a beeline for " likrish " sticks on the candy counter . A huge St. Bernard dog recognizes something of a kindred spirit in Bryan . and they exchange felicitations on the sidewalk . The day is waning now . It is time to emplane for the return trip to Indianapolis . Mr. John H. Fitzpatrick , our host at the lordly Red Lion , bids us adieu . When we reach the little Pittsfield airport again , Bryan , by now a world traveler who has already spent a night away from home , talks it up , man to man , with the pilot and navigator of our aircraft . The give and take was so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bryan had already decided that he was going to be an airman when he grew up . But not so . Confronted by the question , the lad thought a minute and this was his answer : " Well , I think I 'll probably be an artist . " And as we zoom up into the twilight , a down . ward look invades the most secret places of the wooded hills . Suddenly a snowy field blushes with the breast feathers of a hundred robins newly arrived from the South . Six majestic Canadian geese float on the surface of a small pond . hidden deep in the safe forest , resting before the final leg of the flight to their northern home . It is almost spring . 1
