Continuing the roll call of the 1975 Nobel Prizes , Sweden 's Karolinska Institutet and Royal Academy of Sciences last week named ten winners ( left to right , below ) , four of them Americans , in four different areas of science . Prizes in each category total $143,000 . <P> PHYSIOLOGY OR MEDICINE : Renato Dulbecco , 61 , Howard Temin , 40 , and David Baltimore , 37 . <P> Before discoveries made by this trio , doctors knew that viruses could enter a cell , seize control of its machinery and force it to reproduce copies of the viral invaders . Dulbecco , an Italian now working in London , demonstrated that the invaded cell 's descendants showed the influence of the viral genes as well as its own . Temin , of the University of Wisconsin , and Baltimore , of Massachusetts Institute of Technology , shattered what had been the central dogma of genetics : the belief that the master molecule DNA always passed information along to the messenger molecule RNA . The two researchers proved that the process could also work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reversal . Their work and that of Dulbecco-has helped establish viruses - which contain either RNA or DNA-as a prime suspect in human cancer , and could point the way to eventual control of the disease . <P> PHYSICS : Aage Bohr , 53 , Benjamin Mottelson , 49 , and James Rainwater , 57 . <P> Bohr and his Chicago-born collaborator Mottelson ( also a Danish citizen ) , both associated with Copenhagen 's Niels Bohr Institute , *and Rainwater , of Columbia University , were cited for their 1940s and 1950s research on the inner structure of the atom . They helped explain oddities in the nucleus ' behavior by showing that its myriad components spun and vibrated so as to distort the nucleus into an unexpected ellipsoid , rather than a sphere . These new insights helped set the stage for many of the important advances in particle physics during the past two decades of experimentation . <P> CHEMISTRY : John Warcup Cornforth , 58 , and Vladimir Prelog , 69 . <P> Cornforth , an Australian-born researcher now at the University of Sussex , and Yugoslav-born Prelog , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ define the three-dimensional structure of organic molecules . Cornforth , who has been deaf since boyhood , concentrated on enzymes-the catalysts for chemical reactions in living things-while Prelog studied other organic molecules , including antibiotics . <P> ECONOMICS : Tjalling Koopmans , 65 , and Leonid Kantorovich , 63 . <P> Koopmans , a Dutch-born American at Yale University , and Kantorovich , of Moscow 's Institute for Management of the People 's Economy , were honored for developing " linear programming " or " activity analysis , " techniques that are part of the computerization of the " dismal science . " They enable capitalists and commissars alike to make the most efficient use of workers , machines and raw materials , and to determine how fast production should grow . <P> <P> *Founded by Bohr 's father , a Nobel laureate himself and a founder of modern atomic theory .
