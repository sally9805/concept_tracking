" Thus Clarke , who describes himself as " superrational , " decided to try it . Last April-long before he knew he would write this week 's Behavior story on TM-he invested $125 and four days in TM training . " I ca n't claim any miracles , " says Clarke , " but I write with greater ease and speed now .
