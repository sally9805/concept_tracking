txt Jaime Roldos Aguilera took office today as the first elected Ecuadorean President of this decade and pledged himself to the propagation of democracy and human rights throughout the hemisphere . Speaking at an inauguration gathering for foreign heads of state and other highranking officials , Mr. Rotas , a yellow , red and blue silk sash of office draped across his chest , said : " The Latin American map shows two antagonistic areas . On the one side we encounter the states governed by democratic regimes , freely elected by their people ; and on the other , the countries subdued by dictatorships . " The infringements of human rights and constitutional guarantees create pockets of resistance and threaten hemispheric peace . Because of that Ecuador , lover of peace , will seek solutions to this political epidemic that violates the democratic instincts of the Latin American people . " He also said that Ecuador , while respecting the principle of nonintervention in the internal affairs of other nations , " reserves the right to conduct its bilateral relations case by case " according to individual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the dawning of more democracy for Latin America , " he said . Lauds Carter on Human Rights Mr. ** praised President Carter 's human rights program and nodded as he did so toward the front row , where Rosalynn Carter , head of the United States delegation , was seated . The new President also had praise for the Sandinist revolution in Nicaragua and gave a similar nod of greeting to Violeta Barrios de Chamorro , a member of the ruling Nicaraguan junta who was seated at Mrs. Carter 's side . It was a day in which regional politics played as much of a role as did the celebration of Ecuador 's return to representative government after nine years of civilian and military dictatorships . President Carter , who had championed democracy in Ecuador , entertained Mr. Rotas at the White House last month and sent both Mrs. Carter and Secretary of State Cyrus R. Vance to this 9,000-foothigh capital today for the swearing-in ceremonies . After the festivities in the Legislative Palace , Mr. Vance began two days of meetings with representatives of 11 countries who were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ministers . The principal matter on Mr. Vance 's agenda was the situation in Central America following the Nicaraguan revolution . His meetings today and tomorrow included conferences with Mrs. Chamorro , with the Presidents of Costa Rica , Ca lombia and Venezuela , all of whom played key roles in the negotiations at the end of the Nicaraguan war , and with officials from El Salvador , the Central American nation with social and political conditions most like those that led to the revolt in Nicaragua . Mr. ** 38 years old , is the youngest President in Latin America and was originally a stand-in candidate for Assad Bucaram , a long-time populist figure in Ecuadorean politics . Mr. RoldOs and Osvaldo Hurtado Larrea , 40 , were elected President and Vice President with 68 percent of the popular vote on April 29 . Since then , Mr. RoldOs has traveled throughout this nation of 7.3 million people and around the Americas , exhibiting an enthusiasm for assuming a role as a spokesman for democracy in the region . In his speech today , Mr. ** did not detail how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the continent , but he has said in the past , for instance , that he would consider breaking relations with nations such as Uruguay if he was dissatisfied with its observance of human rights . Warns of Economic Sacrifices Mr. ** takes over a country with a foreign debt approaching $4 billion , an inflation rate of up to 15 percent and the threat of seeing its oil exports dry up by 1985 unless new explorations are undertaken and are successful . He warned today of economic sacrifices and said he would take " firm and immediate " steps to persuade petroleum prospectors , previously reluctant because of erratic government programs , to come back into Ecuador . He said his " great commitment " was to the poor of Ecuador , and he demonstrated the point by reading a section of his speech in Quechua , the Indian language . The three members of the outgoing military junta participated in today 's transfer of power , and Mr. Rotas , once their antagonist , paid them a tribute " for having kept their word on the plan to return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
