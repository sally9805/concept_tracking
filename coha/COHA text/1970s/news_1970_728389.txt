txt For years , purchasers of a brand of pressure-sensitive sealing tape made by Nopi , a Danish concern , were never quite sure when , where or how they would get delivery of the merchandise they had ordered . " Between Copenhagen and here , a million and one things could go wrong , " says one New York firm . " Our orders might be translated incorrectly , boat schedules were unpredictable and dock strikes would hold up shipments interminably . Even under the best conditions , it took six weeks to two months to get delivery . " Now U.S. customers of Nopi usually can get delivery within days . The reason : Nopi , after seven years of exporting to its American customers , last year set up operations in the U.S. itself . From headquarters in Hackensack . N.J. , where huge spools of tape produced in Denmark are converted to the proper dimensions , shipments can be made to almost any U.S. city within a week . As a result , snafus are rare , customers are happy and Nopi 's sales @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't alone in its decision to make a direct investment in the U.S. In the past few years , an increasing number tot foreign-owned concerns , primarily European , have been establishing operations here . Most are companies that previously had exported to this country . Some are companies that are expanding already existing subsidiaries or introducing new product lines . A few are companies entering the American market for the first time . " In the past , when you spoke of a multinational company , the chances were pretty good that you were referring to a U.S. concern with direct investments abroad , " says Richard Kaufman , an economist in Chase Manhattan Bank 's international investments division . " The 1970s are going to see rapid growth in the number of foreign companies that become multinational . For most , the ultimate objective will be a foothold in the U.S. " A number of foreign concerns have been established in the U.S. for so long that many people do n't even realize they are headquartered abroad , of course . Included are Royal Dutch/ Shell Group , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Swiss chocolate and food products concern , and Unilever , the Dutch-British concern that owns , among other things , Good Humor Ice Cream Co. and Lever Brothers , the soap company . Even one of the 30 companies whose stocks are used in the Dow Jones Industrial Average , Canadian-based International Nickel Co. , is foreign to the United States . The Total : $10.8 Billion Probably the biggest foreign-owned complex in the U.S. , at least in terms , , of the number of ventures , is Philips N.V. , the Dutch electrical and electronics company . At last count , Philips owned or controlled 32 companies in the U.S. , ranging from a Southern bus line to a maker of nylon bristle brushes . But foreign investment here is still only a fraction of direct investment by U.S. companies abroad . The book value of U.S. investments abroad totaled $64.8 billion at the end of 1968 , the latest year for which figures are available , according to the Commerce Department . In contrast , direct investment in the U.S. totaled $10.8 billion . ( The Commerce Department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control , as distinguished from a portfolio investment . ) There is little question that foreign investment in the U.S. now is growing rapidly , however . New direct investment in 1968 totaled $426 million , up from $133 million the year before , and it 's estimated that new investments in 1969 jumped another 15% to 20% . The Reason Among the foreign concerns making major moves into U.S. markets recently have been Pechiney Aluminum Corp. , a French company that is about to complete the acquisition of Howmet Corp. , a U.S. metals fabricator ; Akzo , Holland 's big textile and chemical combine , which purchased majority interests in American Enka Corp . and International Salt Co. , and Badische Anilin &; Soda-Fabrik AG , a West German chemical company that acquired 98.5% of Wyandotte Chemicals Corp . and announced plans for a $200 million processing plant in South Carolina . The most publicized development has been the merger of a British Petroleum Co. unit into Standard Oil Co . ( Ohio ) in a transaction that may ultimately give British Petroleum a majority interest in Sohio . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former Sinclair Oil Corp . service stations in the U.S. and several refining plants from Atlantic Richfield Co. for about $400 million . Observers say there is one overwhelming reason for the trend : The simple desire to nail down a piece of the action in one of the world 's biggest marketplaces . " The European economy has reached the stage where companies are beginning to look around for other opportunities , " says John B. Rhodes , an international affairs expert at ** &; Hamilton Inc. , the consulting firm . " The growth opportunities in Europe are n't as great as they once were , and Europe no longer enjoys such a big advantage in labor costs . " Even a small chunk of the American market can mean a sizable gain in revenues and profits for many foreign concerns . Air Liquide Co. , a French company that acquired three U.S. industrial gas concerns last year , recently disclosed that its 4% share of the U.S. market in industrial gases will add about 15% to its revenues and may result in a profit increase of close to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fears they may have had about entering the huge , competitive American market . These fears were given dramatic expression a couple of years ago in " The American Challenge , " a much-publicized treatise by French journalist Jean-Jacques Servals-Schreiber . He warned of a serious " management gap " between European companies and their U.S.-counterparts and asserted that burgeoning investment in Europe by U.S. companies was largely due to superior American organizational techniques . Executives of foreign concerns readily admit they have something to learn from American business  --  indeed , many foreign companies use their U.S. subsidiaries as training grounds for future top executives  --  but they say that whatever gap existed is being closed fikt . In some cases , foreign technology and management methods are leapfrogging past US. capabilities . When Akzo acquired its majority interest in International Salt , it picked up $56 million in annual sales , but International Salt hopes to use Akzo 's advanced know-how in salt-chemical technology to carve out some new markets for itself in the U.S. Making Some Mistakes That 's not to say foreign concerns do n't make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. The most common error is insufficient market research , according to management experts . " A lot of European companies think that because the American market is so big , all they have to do is put their wares out on a counter and wait behind the cash register , " says Booz-Allen 's Mr. Rhodes . The result can be disaster . A German maker of brassieres , for example , several years ago was forced to pull out of the . A.mericah market because sales were so poor . " They did n't realize you have to have a marketing strategy in the U.S. , " says a source close to the situation . " In this country , people have to be convinced that they should buy an item . You have to merchandise competitively . " To compensate for their lack of knowledge about American markets , many foreign concerns make their first entry into th8 U.S. via a take-over of an existing American firm . In a number of cases , this has led to a confrontation with U.S. antitrust officials . ' AlthOugh Justice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such combinations , it 's apparent that they feel mergers between big foreign and U.S. concerns may tend to restrain competition and thus violate the law . The biggest brouhaha recently involved the linkup between British Petroleum and Sohio . Justice Department opposition was dropped only alter the companies agreed to divest themselves of some lucrative service stations that compete with one another in Ohio and western Pennsylvania . A Job in Paris Opposition also stems from nonofficial quail ters . Commerce Department officials say they occasionally get letters from irate U.S. businessmen who say they have been hurt by competition from foreign-owned concerns . " What they do n't understand is that most of the time the foreign companies are merely shifting from importing their goods to making them here . "
