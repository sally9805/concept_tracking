BILLIE JEAN KING 'S SECRETS FOR WINNING TENNIS If you can take an old racket and actually hurl it into the opposite court , you can learn to serve . By Billie Jean King Many people think that because 1 am an athlete and like to compete I must be tough . To my surprise this attitude even exists among some of the so-called women 's libbers . It just seems to be a generally accepted fact that a woman who is competitive in her career must also be competitive in her personal life . I do n't agree with this notion at all ( and neither does my husband ) . Although I play tennis competitively to win , I do n't like to beat men . I 've beaten them in practice and they were crestfallen . I beat Bobby Riggs and felt badly about it because the match was publicized as a battle between the the sexes . It was n't that at all . It was a competition between a young athlete and an aging athlete and , despite the male chauvinists , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this stage of our careers , Bobby 's and mine , I am the better player , and that 's all there is to it . It is still true , nevertheless , that a good man can beat a good woman if they are more or less of equal age . There 's no way I could beat Rod Laver , Stan Smith , or Pancho Gonzales . But I think at some time in the future we may very well have a woman win the world championship of tennis . The woman champion of the future will probably be one who has been brought up differently from most of today 's women . She will not have to face discrimination in sports and will probably be a woman who has been a good all-around athlete since childhood , accustomed to competing against men without any mental hangups . That was not my case . I was brought up to be a wife , to consider men physically superior , and to look at sports strictly as a man 's occupation . When I was in junior high school and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in favor of tennis tournaments , my friends thought 1 was an oddball . I soon learned it was not a good idea to beat a boy I liked , It 's amazing how losing to a girl can turn a guy off . Most fellows consider the girl who is a better athlete a threat . The only men who do n't think this way are , in my view , the real men ; these are the men who have their own thing , too , and no one can take that away from them . But I loved tennis and as the daughter of parents with a low income ( my father was a Long Beach fireman ) , I felt that if I could become proficient at tennis maybe I could travel and meet people  --  a notion the other girls laughed at . I persisted , however , and learned that if a woman wants to make sports a career she has to be strong-willed because most everyone will try to discourage her . Even today it 's a tough psychological battle for the girl who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting easier thanks to the increasing number of women athletes who are successful and popular . Many people still think that a woman ca n't be competitive because she ca n't stand up to the emotional pressure . I think , however , that anyone who saw my match against Bobby Riggs realized that I was under intense emotional pressure , not because I was a woman , but because I was an athlete in an all-out endeavor against another athlete . Tennis is my thing and I love it . The aesthetics of the game turn me on . There are few thrills in life for me that compare with hitting a particular shot just right at a given moment  --  knowing that my balance is perfect , that the ball has hit the pocket of the racket , and that it has taken me fifteen years of steady practice and playing to make the right shot at the right time . But , first , you have to have a natural talent to develop . Then , when you have developed that talent to the utmost of your personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the payoff is a tingling feeling deep inside and all through your body that must be comparable to that of the musician who thinks he has discovered the lost chord . That 's why , for me , tennis is such a fascinating and creative sport . There 's a constant challenge in making the ball do exactly what you want it to do and there are constant decisions : shall I use a spin or a slice , shall I lob or go down the line or hit cross-court ? All the choices are there , laid out for the player just as the colors are laid out on a palette for the artist . And the frustrations are there , too . I do n't think anyone has ever hit the absolutely perfect shot any more than anyone has ever painted the perfect picture or written the perfect sentence . Most creative things in life can be improved , so I keep on practicing and practicing . Practice is the name of the game . There are no shortcuts to playing tennis . There 's only practice and more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to distill the knowledge of nineteen years of active tennis playing and constant experimentation , always searching for new ways to improve on old techniques .

But she admits that Auhrey Menen 's quotation of a young Indian communist a few years ago is perceptive : " There 's no denying she understands the people . What foreigners never realize is that Indians are perfectly satisfied with their way of life . They moan continually in public . Breast-beating is a national hobby ... but so is self-satisfact The Indian ideal is a great leap forward which would leave us all standing exactly where we were before , but with more money in everybody 's pocket .

Which are the actual mechanics of serving ? One of the best ways to get an idea of the proper service motion is to take an old racket and actually hurl it into the opposite court . If you can do that you can learn to serve . To put it another way , hitting a serve properly is like throwing a baseball or football . The only difference is you " throw " the tennis ball off the racket as an extension of your hand . Once the racket is at the point of maximum backswing , you are fully wound up and coiled , ready to release all your strength and momentum . You get to this position simply by taking the racket back and reaching over your right shoulder , scratching the small of your back with the racket head . If you do this properly , your elbow will be almost straight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strain in your upper arm . Your back should be perfectly straight or arched slightly backward . Do n't bend at the waist . When you start to come forward , everything should move at once . Now your natural momentum will carry you forward , so that at the moment of impact your right foot is on line with your left . What is the proper follow-through for a serve ? Your body should be fully stretched out so that it presents nearly a straight line from the bottom of your feet to the top of your racket . The follow-through ends up on the left side of the body . What is the correct seruice grip ? It is the same as the grip for a Continental forehand , with the V formed by the thumb and forefinger along the upper left-hand corner of the handle pointed a bit to the left of where it was for the forehand . The fingers should be slightly spread apart . Where is the proper place to stand for serving ? According to the rules , when you are serving into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the center of the court to the right sideline . When serving into the ad court you can be anyplace from the center of the court to the left sideline . But by standing as near to the center of the court as possible . when sewing into either court , you give yourself an advantage : you are in the center of the court and thereby able to cover both sidelines after your opponent makes his return . Also , you are in the best position to run forward to the net . What is the more important in a serve- depth or speed ? Depth ! Most beginners , especially women , seem to have difficulty hitting a deep serve  --  that is , getting the serve to within three feet of the service line . If the ball lands shorter than that your opponent can take two leisurely steps forward and knock the ball past you for a winner . This problem is caused by people being afraid to hit the ball too long , but a simple exercise will prove how difficult it is to do this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fence behind the opposite half of the court with a serve . You 'll find it almost impossible . When you are starting out do n't be afraid to have your serves land a little behind the service line . That 's better than having them hit the net . As with all other shots in tennis , once your serve is grooved it 's much easier to shorten the length of it by one or two feet than it is to gain one or two feet of depth . How can I get more power into my serve ? Power is built up from your first acceleration to the point of contact . It starts at the point of scratching your back as you hit up and out and it increases as you continue pushing through the ball after making contact . Power is also obtained by anything else that gives you momentum through the point of contact , such as a snap of the wrist at the top of the serve . How can I keep my opponent from anticipating the place I am going to serve to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Also , try not to look at the place you intend to serve to . You should train yourself to look at the same place each time before beginning a serve . I suggest looking directly at your opponent . RETURN OF SER VE What should I try to achieve with my service return ? Primarily you want to get the ball in play . You should move in before your opponent starts his service motion . That way you put pressure on him before he starts the point , and that little psychological edge is important . Keep in mind , however , that when you move in there will be less distance between you and your opponent 's baseline , so you must adjust the depth of your return . How should I prepare to return a serve ? Stand in the ready position with your weight on the balls of your feet and your racket held firmly in front of you at waist level and pointed straight out toward the net . A hard-hit ball generally comes low over the net , and there 's no point in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as you start your swing . It 's always easier to bring your racket up than to drop it . As soon as the ball leaves your opponent 's racket and you know whether it is coming to your forehand or to your backhand you should turn from the waist and then take your racket back . If there 's time you can then move your feet . Where is the best place to stand for returning the serve of a right-hander ? When a right-hander serves to you , he carries the racket across his body from right to left , causing the ball to drift to your right . If he serves you an extreme slice , the ball may carry as much as eight or ten feet to your right . So when a right-hander serves to you in the deuce or right-hand court you know the ball will tend to drift to the right . Since you want to be equidistant from the two extremes of the ball 's flight , I suggest you stand on the baseline , bisecting the angle . In effect , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you move toward the center . The wider he stands , the wider you stand . Is power or control more importan t in returning service ? Control . When you learn how to hit through the ball properly you can add power . Most people will find it easier to add power to control than to add control to power . Should I return a second serve with as much pace as I do a first serve if the server is coming to net ? On a second serve the ball is coming to you more slowly , so you have more time to get into position and prepare yourself for a good return , as you would for a normal ground shot . Since you have the advantage you should try to attack a second servewhenever possible . If you ca n't go for a winner then hit the return slow and straight at your opponent 's feet , forcing him to bend over and put his own pace on the ball . By hitting the return softly you have time to get into good position for his return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You want to keep your opponent from anticipating where you are going to hit the ball . But above all you must get the ball hack over the net and in play . NET PLA Y ? VOLLEY How much of a backswing is needed fora volley ? Hardly any . You do n't really swing for a volley . Beginners have a tendency to take a full backswing for a volley , as they would for a ground stroke , but if you learn from the beginning to punch your volleys you will never have to worry about breaking a bad habit . The racket moves no more than two feet before it makes contact with the ball . What is the most important thing to remember about a volley ? Always try to get distance and power and , if possible , hit the ball where your opponent is n't or , as the late Vince Lombardi would have said . hit to daylight . How far toward the net should I run before stopping and preparing for a volley ? Run forward as far as you can until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ball , then make one little jump forward so you end up in the ready position with your weight equally distributed on both feet . You can now move either to the right or to the left . What are the differences in handling a volley to the backhand and a volley to the forehand ? When your opponent has hit the ball and you have determined where it is going , do n't wait for the ball to come to you . Turn your body in the direction of the ball . If the ball is coming to your right , turn and step forward and across your body with your left foot . Do n't try to step backward with your right foot . If the ball is coming to your backhand. turn and step forward and across with your right foot . NET PLAY ? OVERHEADS What are the steps in hitting an overhead ? The first thing to do is turn sideways to the flight of the ball and get your racket in back of you as in the scratching-your-back position . Then hit the ball as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down . Never think down . GENERAL QUESTIONS ON SINGLES What is the most important element in strategy ? To understand your game . Most people try to understand their opponent 's game and not their own . In order to play tennis to the maximum of your ability , you have to know your own strengths and weaknesses . Then in a game situation you must constantly try to capitalize on your strengths and protect against your weaknesses . And you must know your emotions . How do you hold up under pressure ? How do you react when you 're ahead ? Can you make a kill when you have a chance ? Do you think you are a winner or a loser ? Do you have any suggestions to help me improve my concentration on the court ? Practice yoga or meditate quietly before a game if that helps you . On a crucial point I concentrate even harder by pretending that I am down . If I 'm ahead 5-3 , I switch it around in my head so I 'm behind and say to myself I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ match . I concentrate like fury on each point , telling myself it 's match point . One thing I can tell you with certainty is that you should not concentrate on your opponent . Concentrate on the ball ! Is it important to develop a bread-and-butter shot ? Everyone has one shot that is his best , a shot that he can count on most of the time . Champions try to make their weak strokes at least adequate , but they all have one great shot which is what helped make them champions . Most people think my bread-and-butter shot is my volley , but I think it is any stroke on my backhand side . If my backhand is off I 'm in trouble . STRATEGY Do different surfaces call for different games ? Indeed they do , as all touring pros will testify . Generally speaking , when you are confronted with a new surface you should concentrate more than usual on the ball , focusing on it from the time it leaves your opponent 's racket and travels across the net until you make the contact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and down as much as possible so that you are able to move quickly if the ball takes an unexpected bounce . What are the basics of fast-court tactics ? Hit the ball on the rise . When playing on a surface that is faster than what you are accustomed to , you must run quickly to the ball and hit it far out in front of your body as it rises from the bounce . All other things being equal , the player who attacks the most on a fast surface has the advantage . When you are playing from the baseline , think of hitting the ball so far in front of your body that your racket will follow through to the far service line . Go to the net whenever possible . Every time your opponent hits a short ball one that bounces at the service line or closer to the net ? hit your next shot deep . if you have hit a good approach shot you should be able to block the return at the net and win the point . Jack Kramer , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theory about playing on cement : if you hit forehands well enough and deep enough down the line and follow them to net , the percentages are in your favor . Concentrate on winning your serve . It is so difficult to break your opponent 's serve on a fast court that you must concentrate on winning your own serve . Attempt to get your first serve in deep and well placed and then follow it to the net . Try to be steady on return of serve . When your opponent is serving , watch the ball at all times , even at the point of contact . Do n't take a big swing if he crunches it in . Hit your return as you would a volley , even though the ball has bounced . Try to block the ball back and keep it low . Do n't overhit . Just because the court is faster does n't mean you have to hit harder . If you hit your shots normally , they will have more pace than on slow courts . Concentrate on hitting every shot with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volley . What are the basics of slow-court tactics ? Slide into the ball on clay . On slow surfaces such as clay you must teach yourself to slide into the ball ; otherwise you will overrun it . I still remember the first time I practiced on the European clay court at the Federation Cup matches in Turin , Italy , and had to admonish myself constantly , " Slide , you dummy . This is n't cement . " Hit the ball at waist height . This is so for almost every ground stroke when playing on a slow court . Hit more cross-court shots . You must play angles a lot more on a slow court in order to get your opponent off the court and set him up for a winner of your own . And because the surface is so slow , you have , in turn , a lot more time to cover the court yourself . Get your first serve in . This applies on any surface but especially on a slow court where your second serve will probably tend to hang in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offensive re t urn. n
