 | Exotic new Batteries -- More Miles for Electric Cars After three years of traveling around the country asking battery experts , car makers , and electrochemists about the batteries that might power your future electric car , one thing seems clear ? if the EV ( electric vehicle ) is ever to be more than a slowpoke , short-range novelty , we 're going to need much better batteries than the lead/acid cells used to start our cars today . To be a serious prospect , an EV will eventually have to run at normal highway speeds ; go at least 200 miles without flagging : rechargeable in a few minutes : as long as an engine-powered cost about the same to buy and more , perhaps less , to operate . . that demands a battery that will somehow squeeze the energy equivalent of a tank of gasoline into light , tight , safe , quickly rechargeable package . When I asked experts whether @#  | such " magic " batteries were really achievable , and if so , how soon they would be installed in practical EV @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plain discouraging . Nearly all the experts - aw better batteries to come , although none could yet be sure which of the many kinds of batteries might win out . And they generally agreed that we were n't likely to see high-performance EV 's in the very near future . The quest for the right battery promises to be long and arduous . But , as Dr. Ernest Littauer , manager of Lockheed 's Palo Alto Chemistry Laboratory , says , " We must start looking at the year 2000 now ; in 1990 it will be too late . " Dr. Littauer is talking about a full-size , full-performance car that could go 200-300 miles before minutes-long " refills . " For the nearer term , automotive industry experts see lightweight , two-seater runabouts , with a range of 100 miles or so by the late 1980 's . To help accelerate EV progress , the U.S. Department of Energy recently awarded $25.6 million in research contracts for just about every battery type for which there appears to be some potential . For a better understanding of what 's involved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a battery is and how it operates . Inside a battery A battery ( or the cells that make up a battery ) is an electrochemical device for converting chemical energy into electrical energy . In operation , electrons are released to move from one terminal , through the working circuit ( motor , lights , whatever ) , to the other terminal . In a primary cell , such as a flashlight battery , this process is irreversible , and the active chemicals gradually become exhausted . For a car , you need a so-called secondary cell , which can be discharged and later returned to its charged state in a reversible chemical action . The most familiar such reaction occurs in the common lead/acid battery . To make a battery , you need two dissimilar , electrochemically active materials ? a " couple " ? that form the anode ( negative ) and cathode ( positive ) terminals . In the lead/acid battery , lead and lead dioxide are the couple . They work in combination with an active electrolyte , sulfuric acid , which actually participates in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sulfur , use an electrolyte only as a passer of ions ( electrically @# ELECTROLYTE FLOW BAFFLE The lithium/air cell actually uses as the cathode air from the atmosphere that has been chemically filtered to remove CO2 . The electrolyte is water , circulated to remove heat and maintain a constant electrolyte condition . The cathode electrode , essentially a current collector , is made of porous charged chemical fragments ) and a blocker of electrons . The important thing is that the couple must be able to release electrons from one member and acquire them at the other . Also , the ions must be able to travel through the cell internally to maintain a complete circuit . How do the electrochemists know which couples are worth investigating ? Estimating the possible energy of a given couple requires calculations involving the number of electrons transferred in the cell reaction and the sum of the molecular weights of the products or reactants . Unfortunately , the real energy densities realized in working cells are usually only 10-20 percent of the calculated ones . But that 's a clue to future progress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room for improvement in how we make them . As might be expected , the most active and attractive couples are those most prone to destroy their own environments and attack containers , connectors , seals , and posgraphite laced with a small amount of platinum catalyst . The lithium anode is pressed against a grooved cathode support by a spring-like bellows . It is possible to press the anode and cathode together because an ionically conducting film forms on the anode . Cell potential is 2.9 to 3.0 volts . sibly the unfortunate driver who happened to collide with a car powered by them . Trying to grade all of the possible cell couples and configurations into a pecking order is futile ; there are too many unknowns and overlaps . But here are five basic types of batteries that may , according to JPL 's Automotive Power Systems Evaluations , be candidates for future electric cars : ? Cells in aqueous electrolytes . ? Ambient-temperature cells in non-aqueous electrolytes . ? Fused-salt , elevated-temperature systems . ? Systems with ion-exchange.or ion-conducting membranes . ? Fuel-cell systems . In order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this way : lead/acid , nickel/iron , nickel/zinc , lithium/iron sulfide , sodium/sulfur , zinc/chlorine , and lithium/air or aluminum/air fuel cells . To compare just how these couples and systems might perform in Continued  | a car , you have to measure a set of common characteristics for each . These are specific energy , specific power , weight per vehicle , cycle life , cost per kilowatt-hour , and recharging behavior . Specific energy ( Whr/lb ) tells you how much energy you can deliver from one pound of on-board weight . Present lead/acid batteries have a dismally low specific energy : 17-18 Whr/lb . But this is offset by the electric motor , which is 80-90 percent efficient ( compared with 15 percent for conventional combustion engine/transmission combinations ) , and it does n't waste fuel idling in traffic . Of course , the higher the specific energy , the greater the range of your car . Pardonable competitive enthusiasm sometimes leads battery spokesmen to quote specific-energy figures in terms of cells , not a finished , working battery installation . The specific energy per cell may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a battery with connecting members , heavy heat-insulating jackets , and external hardware , the figures generally become less dramatic . Specific power ( watts/lb ) represents not only the constant rate delivery capability of a battery but also the peak power deliverable , and might be thought of as passing or hill-climbing power . Specific power thus determines vehicle acceleration and response . Not all batteries with similar specific energies can deliver short bursts of power at high discharge rates . That 's why Toyota , for example , has used hybrid battery systems with zinc/air batteries for high specific energy and lead/acid for quick punches of power . Weight . How much of the total vehicle weight is acceptable for batteries ? Current forecasts range from 20 to 40 percent ? the lighter the better . If an attractive electrochemical couple needs insulating jackets , external storage tanks , pumping equipment , or special safety encapsulation ? and many do ? the engineers must decide whether the trade-off of high specific energy versus weight and bulk is worthwhile . Cycle life and cost per kilowatthour are obviously linked tightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Manager of the Electronics Division of Eagle Picher , " If you have a $50/kWh battery that will last for 500 cycles and a $100/kWh battery that will last 5000 cycles , the ( latter 's ) cost per mile is way down . " And it 's the cost per mile that counts . Recharging behavior turned out to be the skeleton in the closet that few of the electrochemists I interviewed really wanted to confront . They almost always stated confidently that their batteries would accept rapid charging . The question is ? with what ? An on-board recharger in your car would probably add too much weight or be so small that recharging would take forever . A wall-mounted home recharger would probably pull more power than most homes have available . For example , if your car had only a modest 45-kWh capacity and you wanted to charge it up for an evening trip after coming home from work , you 'd need the equivalent of a 45-kW engine generator ( about a 70-hp engine ) to do it in an hour . What 's needed If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , long cycle life , low cost , and rapid rechargeability are the targets for future batteries , how nearly do the various basic types approach this ? As a jumping-off point , I asked the experts if they did n't see some way that lead/acid batteries could be greatly improved . Ray Hudson 's views seem to sum up most of what I was told : " No , I honestly do n't ... The best they can ever do is about 18 Whr/lb . The cycle life of the lead/acid battery is also very poor ; you get 100-150 discharge cycles out of it . " But he added that with a lower discharge rate , such as @# might be used in a hybrid flywheel vehicle , a cycle life of 500-800 was conceivable . Nevertheless , there will probably be a place for lead/acid in some specialty vehicles . Lead/acid has good specific : power to handle sudden heavy loads , costs only about $55 pc -- kWh , and has a well-developed manufacturing technology behind it . Ironically , the nickel/iron alkaline battery , using potassium hydroxide electrolyte @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the century , now seems an excellent near-term candidate . Asked about nickel/iron 's specific energy Bill Harsh of Eagle Picher said " It depends on the time frame Right now we 're at about 50 ; our objective is 60-70 Whr/kg at the end of a three-year period . " Although the energy of nickel/iron is fair but not dramatic , ii has substantial weight advantages works at ambient temperatures and needs no costly , heavy housings . Its truly outstanding feature is cycle life ; 5000 cycles is accepted as being no problem . Recent improvements in both electrodes have made the old Edison cell look considerably more attractive , according to Harsh . Another alkaline battery , widely publicized by GM as a very likely candidate for near-term electric cars , is the nickel/zinc battery , or . as GM prefers to call it , zinc/nickel oxide . It was ( really ) invented by the Russians way back in 1901 . Nickel/zinc operates at ambient temperatures and uses an aqueous electrolyte of about a 40-percent )  | solution of potassium hydroxide . Dr. John L. Hartman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A zinc/nickel oxide cell storthe same amount of energy as a lead/acid cell weighs only about one-third as much and takes up less than half the space . " Although present technology seems aimed at early production batteries with 66 - Whr/kg , a recent SAE survey suggests an advanced capability as high as 92 Whr/kg . Nickel is not cheap , but projected costs range from $50 to $70 per kWh . That 's because new techniques bypass the early solid sintered nickel electrode . Fortunately , it 's not the solid nickel that does the electrochemical work . All that 's really important is the nickel oxyhydroxide , for which the sintered nickel served as a matrix . Now , GM has dispensed with the sintered nickel in favor of a matrix of graphite powder and an organic binder with the nickel oxyhydride mixed in and the whole thing rolled out like a pie crust . Even if the cost and weight of the nickel electrode is under control , a thornier problem is only partially solved . When a nickel/zinc battery is recharged , zinc metal sponge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to deposit unevenly , changing the shape of the active area of the electrode . It also forms dendrites of sharp , toothlike projections , which ultimately penetrate the separator and short the cell . Thus , cycle life suffers . GM engineers think they have some answers , such as using slightly dish-shaped electrodes . A different approach , pioneered by a Swedish battery maker and now being developed by ESB , uses vertical vibration of the zinc plate to fight dendrites and uneven metal deposition . Called a Vibrocell , it will have three times the cycle life of lead/acid , ESB says , and can provide 1200 cycles of discharge and recharge . More advances , more problems When I turned from the aqueous ambient nickel/iron and nickel/zinc batteries to more advanced batteries of the future , I faced a huge jump in technology . Chemistry , fabrication , containment , and actual installation in a road vehicle all become new and demanding constraints . For example , the lithium/iron sulfide batteries under development by Eagle Picher , GM , and others operate at 700-840 de-@# grees F @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Also , the cells operate under near-vacuum conditions . Nevertheless , this is one of the advanced batteries that may eventually break the energydensity barrier . Eagle Picher is under contract to deliver a Mark 1A lithium/metal sulfide demonstration battery to Argonne National Labs in early 1980 . This will be a 40-kWh battery with a specific energy of 60 Whr/kg to drive a 114-V system . The basic couple is an anode of about 20-percent lithium alloyed with aluminum , and a cathode of iron sulfide or disulfide operating in a lithium chloride/potassium chloride electrolyte . The latter is a eutectic mixture that melts at about 670 degrees F , but , according to Ray Hudson , " because of ion transport in the electrolyte , we Eagle Picher found it very beneficial to keep the cell operating at temperatures above 750 degrees F. " I asked him what he saw in the where a conductive path exists to the cathode current collector . As the input air containing a small amount of CO2 is passed through lithium hydroxide ( formed as the cells operate ) , an insoluble precipitate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ removed periodically at a collection station . future for the specific energy of lithium/metal sulfide . He said , " Today , on a cell basis , we 're demonstrating 100 Whr/kg . In the second generation we want to get that up to 125 , and , eventually , we 'll get to about 200 Whr/kg . " Ray warned me that those were cell ratings and did n't represent what happened when the weight of the necessary insulation and hardware were added ? a penalty of about 20 percent . A model of the Eagle Picher battery looked like a long , gleaming metal live-bait box , but Hudson told me it used multi-layer insulation developed by Thermo Electron ; although it would run over 700 degrees F inside , it would be only warm to the touch outside . " We must maintain the thing under very high vacuum , " Hudson said . That explained the very rigid , corrugated inner container . He then showed me a rather ordinarylooking fabric-like material and said , " This is our separator materi- FEBRUARY 1979 81  | al , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ material , now , that withstands the lithium/sulfur environment . It costs about $500 per square foot , so of course we 've got some work to do on the separators . " Making sandwiches GM 's lithium/iron disulfide cells look different from the cells I saw at Eagle Picher . The chemical structure also differs : Two negative lithium-in-silicon alloy and eutectic lithium chloride/lithium potassium plates sandwich a positive plate compacted and sintered from a mixture of iron , iron sulfur and lithium sulfur compounds , carbon and lithium chloride , and potassium chloride . That 's quite a complex sandwich . GM uses the expensive boron nitride and zirconia cloths as separators . The sandwich construction , called bipolar , goes back , according to Thompson G. Bradley of GM research , to Volta 's 19th-century " artificial electric device . " Its advantages : light weight , high performance , low internal resistance , and a direct path for the electrons to reduce the need for current collectors . In the latest reported tests , such cells have gone through more than 250 deep-discharge cycles and operated over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investigated , the greater the differences of opinion became . Sodium/sulfur batteries , for example , are being researched by Dow Chemical , Ford Motor , Chloride Silent Power ( Britain ) , GE , Brown Boveri , Compagnie Generale Electrique of France , and Yurasa of Japan . Perhaps that 's why the estimates of attainable Whr/kg vary from 80 by a company not ( presumably ) on the sodium/sulfur bandwagon , all the way to 300 by some European proponents . A recent SAE forecast is 198 Whr/kg . Dr. Charles A. Levine of Dow Chemical 's research lab calculates 270 Whr/kg on a cell basis , but points out that putting cells into an insulated box , necessary since they operate at 570 degrees F to maintain the sodium and sulfur in a molten state , would take that down to about 200 Whr/kg . Dr. Levine thinks our EV sights are set too low . He says , " Argonne Argonne National Labs is charged with overall responsibility for U.S. EV-battery research is talking about a 45-kWh battery , but we really think that 's too small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we think you 'll have to furnish an electric car the size of a Chevrolet Nova or something like that . " Dow 's fascinating battery has a unique cell construction . The active materials are molten sodium ( anode ) and sulfur ( cathode ) at 570 degrees F. The electrolyte is a solid membrane or separator that passes ions but not electrons or liquid . Other experimenters have used beta alumina , a ceramic-like aluminum oxide , but Dow uses very thin-walled boron glass tubes about 0.003-0.004 inches in diameter . The walls are about 10 mitre thick . Dr. Levine describes t glass as " just a network of thin with an occasional ion in it , mot , so they can jump from here - there . " The top end of each tube open to a reservoir , much as tubes in a car radiator open it the top tank . " We put sodium here ( the reservoir ) and let it go down ins : . the fibers and dip them in suiteWe 've got thousands of these lit ! fibers ( tubes ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The bundle tubes he showed me was actually a small cell about one inch in diameter , but it had about 3000 little tubes in it , open on one end and closed on the other , fitted with foil strips for electrical contact and , Levine said , " jelly-rolled together All told , the active surface area the tiny tubes was enormous . small pump is used to bring freematerials to the active areas . I thought this exotic cell must 1 : enormously expensive , but Dr. Le - vine was undismayed . " We this : it 's going to be by far the lea expensive design ? about the sane price per unit of energy as a good lead/acid battery . " Problems with sodium Recharging is no great problem apart from the original one : Where do you get the charging power Levine called that " truly a horrendous problem , " partly because he thought that competitive cars witdifferent battery types would probably require different charging techniques so recharge filling stations could n't be standardized . Not all of Dow 's competitors are enthusiastic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safe-@#  | tv hazard with the sodium/sulfur system . " He was worried about the reaction of sodium and air : " Theslightest crack in the system , and you 've got a bomb sitting there . If the sodium gets to air that has any moisture in it at all , it 's just gone . " Surmounting all the pros and cons of sodium/sulfur , including the manifest difficulty of massproduction technology , is the great lure of a cycle life that seems to be sky high , probably well over 3000 cycles . As Dr. Levine says , " It 's just two liquids . . . there 's no shape change and it should be capable of an infinite number of charge/discharge cycles . " Sodium/sulfur batteries are likely to be tried for utility load leveling before going into cars . But another exotic concept , the zinc/chloride battery , is one of the few advanced types that has actually been tested in running vehicles . Energy Development Associates ( EDA ) of Madison Heights , Mich. , has demonstrated the system in a test-bed Vega at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Although zinc/chloride has a slightly lower specific energy than sodium/sulfur ( estimates vary from 110 to 150 Whr/kg ) , it has some advantages : The system 's couple , zinc and chlorine , is cheap and available ; it runs near ambient temperatures and pressures ; it uses an aqueous ( zinc chloride and water ) electrolyte ; it has good cycle life ; and it undergoes no chemical action while idle . Zinc/chloride is actually a system rather than a self-contained battery . The reason for the circuitous arrangement shown in the diagram is that chlorine is a deadly gas under ambient conditions ; it is totally impractical to store it in a gaseous state in a car . EDA worked out a way to store it as a safe , yellow , ice-like chlorine hydrate by mixing the gas produced during charging with water and chilling it to 9.6 degrees C , just under 50 degrees F. In operation , there 's a heating effect in the battery stack , and when the warmed electrolyte returns to the hydrate-storage area , enough heat is added to release some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plates . The process continues until all the hydrate is used or until the circulating pump is stopped . Chemically , the reaction is reliable and simpler than in other advanced batteries . Obviously , since a highly toxic gas is used , the mechanical design would have to @# @# @# be very much on the fail-safe side . Whether zinc/chloride will ever be acceptable on the highway is debatable . Quick recharge Of all the power-storage devices I saw and heard about , the most exciting were the lithium/air and aluminum/air fuel cells developed at Lockheed . These involve mechanically recharging the vehicular power cell with an electrochemical fuel . Rather than being a local-use second car , tied almost literally to its charger , the electric car could go anywhere , any time , and be refueled promptly at a roadside station . Dr. Littauer envisions " a fullperformance , five-passenger vehicle with a range of 200 to 300 miles . " The car would be stocked with sufficient metal fuel ( lithium or aluminum ) for about 1000 miles . Once , twice , or three times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd stop for a few minutes to take on water ( needed in the cell reaction ) and discharge the reaction product , lithium carbonate , a dry powder precipitated by flowing carbon dioxide through the residue in the battery . This powder would be collected and recycled . At the end of 1000 miles , another push-pull , click-click operation would drop in new metal plates , and you 'd start fresh . Originally , when I first talked to Dr. Littauer , we discussed only lithium/air cells . Later , as research progressed , the aluminum/air cells were developed and now seem even more attractive . Both have extremely high power densities . You throw in a new stack for instant recharge ? 6700 to 7700 Whr/kg . That 's quite dramatic . Lithium/air fuel cells are being used now in certain classified applications . And , in spite of an anticipated lengthy development stage , they look like good prospects for EV 's because they fit the ordinary driver 's needs so well . There are other fuel cells , but , as Dr. Littauer says , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the most energetic electrochemical couple without going to halogens , chlorine , fluorine , and so on , which are not really safe and are awful things in an accident . Lithium operates at room temperature , and does n't catch fire . " The only other metals worth considering in an air cell , he says , are aluminum , magnesium , and calcium . @#  | Although aluminum has been tractive because of its low cost a noncritical nature , previous effort to use it in a cell were frustration . The cell either went dead quick or destroyed itself . Now , new Toys from Olin Matheson and Reynolds Aluminum seem to corr these problems , although just h is not well understood . Dr. Littaue reports cell efficiencies near 1 percent at cell temperatures about 120 degrees F. The electrolyte is a 10-30-percent solution of potassium hydroxide with certain additives . In use , the aluminum plates in the cell are totally consumed before new plates are installed . The product of this reaction is an airdried powder , tri-hydrated alumina hydrargillite , which can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hallmark of these exotic future systems . Tennis-ball ions It 's certainly true of several other new batteries based on a phenomenon called intercalation. which can be roughly pictured as wedging ions into a crystal-lattice atom structure like a tennis ball stuck in a wire fence backstop . One such battery , using a lithium negative electrode and a titanium disulfide positive electrode , has been successfully operated in a car by Exxon Research and Engineering of Linden , N.J. At present , the theoretical specific energy is about 480 Whr/kg , but the actual battery was designed to operate at 134 Whr/kg to keep temperatures and voltage variations reasonable . Although Exxon 's lithium/titanium disulfide battery operates at ambient temperature , it 's not an aqueous type . The electrolyte is an organic liquid ? propylene carbonate and methyl acetate . As I looked at the intercalation storage of electrical particles and reviewed the literature on it , I realized that here was yet another new and remarkable approach to batteries , with strands leading to a number of researchers , including Bell Telephone Labs , the University of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Following every strand would require more time , travel , and interviews . The same is true of some of the variations on the batteries I 've touched on . I can only conclude that as the battery pot boils , the best ingredients will float to the top . m
