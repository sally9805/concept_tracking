1776 <P> Directed by PETER H. HUNT <P> Screenplay by PETER STONE <P> The idea was to portray the Second Continental Congress and the beginnings of the American war of independence as occasions for song and dance . Joan Littlewood could have managed it , making a brazenly satiric three-ring vaudeville out of the babble of idealism , pomposity and compromise from which America rather tentatively emerged . Sermons are much closer to the heart of 1776 than satire , however , and the business of turning the founding fathers into a crew of periwigged chorus boys has been accomplished with all due seriousness . Like the hit Broadway show on which it is faithfully based , the movie has a cozy smugness that removes all challenge from the ideas of , say , Adams and Jefferson ( Tom Paine is mentioned once-quickly ) , and it makes an uprising against oppression seem as radical as a meeting of Jaycees . <P> The shroud of sanctimony is so oppressive that the movie 's random moments of lightheartedness make one almost grovel with relief . The one good musical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Independence , with each member of the selection committee fobbing off the assignment on another , and all joining in a jaunty chorus that parodies , fleetingly , the idea that any of them should be singing or dancing at all . Sherman Edwards ' songs are usually reserved for important occasions like a speech on the shared immorality of slavery , or the apparently telepathic communications between John Adams and his wife , but they remain bumptiously banal . <P> In lieu of characterization , Scenarist Stone ( Charade , Father Goose ) furnishes each prominent member of the congress with a quirk or a foible by which he will be easily recognizable , if not quite human . Thus John Adams ( William Daniels ) is a prig , Jefferson ( Ken Howard ) a love-smitten daydreamer , Franklin ( Howard Da Silva ) a convivial pragmatist , and so on . The actors seize on these poor scraps and work them to death , although they should probably be commended for not breaking into giggles over such Stone dialogue as " Better get yourself down to Congress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want independence . " J.C .
