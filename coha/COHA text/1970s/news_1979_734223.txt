txt Letters The Oil That 's Waiting for the U.S. Consumer To the Editor : To my great dismay , The Times is once again espousing a shortsighted , easy answer to our energy problem ? the export of Alaskan oil ( " The Oil That 's Waiting for Congress , " editorial May 30 ) . ? Inasmuch as the major oil companies have failed to maintain the commitment they made to develop a domestic distribution system for Alaskan oil ( a breach of faith the editorial excuses ) , The Times has embraced the notion that the United States can " stimulate " domestic petroleum production by engaging in a trilateral swap with Japan and Mexico . The idea is not new , having been first advanced in . the mid-1970 's , but then the third partner was Iran , not Mexico . We were told by the Nixon and Ford Administrations that the Shah 's friendly and stable regime was a good one to do business with . Now it 's Mexico , whose Gulf Coast . oil fields have caused us to clutch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : One can not say that Monday-morning quarterbacking is un-American ; it is a national pastime . ? But it seems hardly just or defensible to visit retroactive criticism and ridicule on Marion and Senator Javits , as you did in your June 1 editorial " The Ma-and-Pa Javits Store . " As recently as last summer the socalled Shah , whom we now know as butcher of his people , was a pillar of the " free world " and our enduring pal . Multiple multinationals paid him and his establishment tribute . If Mrs. Javits was wrong to take at face value our Government 's avowals that this was our country 's great and good friend ( and hence kosher to work for ) , that does not seem to me to call for a new scolding for a matter which was resolved at the time . Nor does it justify the unexpected condemnation of a Republican Senator more capable , useful and progressive than most . of his Democratic colleagues with the harsh phrase , undocumented , " The Javits family trades in influence . " HOWARD N. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To the Editor : Youssef M. Ibrahim describes his experience in crossing the border from Jordan to Israel ( news story May 29 ) but fails to make the most significant observation that the two countries are in a state of war . It is only Israel 's humanitarian policy of the " Open Bridges " that makes the movement of civilians back and forth possible . Thus , last year over a million crossings were recorded on the two bridges , most of them of Arabs from Jordan , Judea and Samaria , Gaza , Lebanon , Kuwait , Saudi Arabia and other Arab League countries . Hundreds of trucks carrying produce and other goods cross the bridges daily and maintain the undisrupted trading patterns on which Arabs on both sides depend for their needs and livelihood . The Arab civilian who is subjected to the ordeal of a thorough security ' check may be innocent , but some of his neighbor to our bosom much like an abandoned son who has won the Irish Sweepstakes . The happenstance of a common boundary and the newly found warmth we feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that if we use their oil we will be less dependent on ( incredibly ) foreign sources . It should be remembered that our client neighbor in South America , Venezuela , is a member of OPEC ( and frequently leads the charge for higher prices ) and that our neighbor to the north , Canada , with whom we share another common boundary , has all but shut off oil exports to the U.S. But never mind that , The Times tells us , if Mexico stops sending oil to us ( in a swap ) , we 'll just stop sending oil to Japan . So , there ! Oh , would that it be so easy . The problem , of course , is , if that day did come we would be back at square one , with no domestic distribution system in place ; more dependent To the Editor : The New York State Legislature is now reviewing New York 's mandatory sentences for narcotic offenses . In my view , extensive revision is essential . // Sue Coe Penalties for heroin and cocaine violations are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heroin passes down the pyramid of illicit distribution , it is diluted to increase its bulk . The bottom-rung offender is compatriots are not . Explosives and arms smuggled through the borders facilitated terrorist acts which resulted during the last 10 years in 1,130 civilian deaths and 2,471 serious injuries . One shudders to think how much higher that toll could be if security measures were less stringent . The Palestinian merchant who told Mr. Ibrahim that every time he goes through the bridges he asks himself , " How can we make peace with these people ? " obviously does not appreciate , or does not want to admit , that " these people , " who take pains and risks in maintaining the freedom of movement he enjoys , deserve his consideration as partners in peace . But Mr. Ibrahim , as an independent observer , should recognize that .

The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increase Alaskan production and make a fair profit by doing so when they realize that the only new market available to , them is the one in the continental United States . As you know , the Congress is on the brink of persuading the nation 's oil companies that such is true as the members consider the provisions of the Export Administration Act of 1979 . That bill , containing an amendment prohibiting the export of Alaskan oil , is moving toward floor action in the House and Senate at this time . I expect that when consideration is concluded , the major oil companies will discover a new market ? the one that 's always existed here at home . STEWART B. MCKINNEY Member of Congress , 9th Dist. , Conn . Washington , May 31 , 1979 penalized more severely than a top distributor whose pure heroin weighs less than the diluted street product . The law makes no distinction between cocaine and heroin . Cocaine is not a narcotic , is not addictive and is not criminogenic . It should be classified with other stimulants . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gap between one year and life is unreasonable . Probation is now impossible except for informers , with the consent of the prosecutor . Judges , not prosecutors , should decide who is placed on probation , for sentencing is the responsibility of judicial authority . Life sentences and limitations on plea bargaining for minor offenders violates fundamental concepts of ' justice . They are also counterproductive since they jam courts and prisons with petty offenders , compelling the authorities to deal lightly with homicides and other violent offenses . Federal law authorizes life sentences for persons who occupy a supervisory role in narcotics traffic . This approach makes more sense than present state lam DAVID BERNHEIM New York , June 1 , 1979 To Spare a Murderer To the Editor : In a June 2 letter , Samm Sinclair Baker expresses confusion as to the deterrent effect of capital punishment and asks that unbiased experts analyze the existing data to provide an empirical answer .

JOSEPH TEMPLEMAN Brooklyn , June 4 , 1979 Celsius Reconsidered The Cost of Mideastern ' Open , Bridges ' If New York Medical Balks at Abortions Flaws in New York 's Narcotics Law To the Editor : It 's hard to reconcile The Times 's frequent criticism of municipal hospitals with your editorial position on the affiliation between New York Medical College and Lincoln and Metropolitan Hospitals . New York Medical will receive $24 million to provide medical services to these hospitals , but there is doubt whether the college , now affiliated with the Roman Catholic Church , will perform abortions . There is a simple solution . If New York Medical can not assure all municipal patients the services they are entitled to , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to adhere to its own principles , but on its own money , not municipal hospital funds . The Times is prepared to wait and see " whether the Medical College serves the Archdiocese , the city or both . " The Times can afford to wait . But what about the women who will be penalized if it turns out that the college did n't serve the city ? By the time any rectification occurs , their lives may have been seriously distorted . A preliminary report by the Department of Health , Education and Welfare has stated that anticipated closings of municipal hospitals will violate the civil rights of minority-group residents of this city by depriving them of access to health care . Arbitrarily curtailing services within a hospital will be more of the same . Interestingly , we read of the possibility of the corporation 's hiring additional doctors to perform abortions , but there is no suggestion of a reduction in the $24 million contract . Will New York Medical get the same $24 million whether it performs abortions or not ? And will The Times include @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ H.H.C. costs ? In fact , is The Times satisfied that the entire $29 million expenditure is justified and will be properly monitored ? In the simplest terms , the terms we hear most often applied by critics of New York 's social programs , what kind of way is this to do business ? V a Jewish-affiliated hospital should decide not to deliver services on the Sabbath will that be O.K. too ? If a contractor to the city is not prepared to fulfill the complete contract , why should the lives of patients and the funds of the city be placed in any jeopardy ? At 829 million a year there are other qualified affiliates available . It is difficult to understand how a vigorous critic of H.H.C. management can tolerate a soft , unbusinesslike arrangement like this . EDWARD HANDMAN District Council 37 American Federation of State , County and Municipal Employees New York , May 28 , 1979 Tolerable Soviet Threat To the Editor : The Administration 's reason for not giving our missiles silo-busting capability is most peculiar : U.S. ability to destroy . ground-based missiles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My question is : Why is n't Moscow 's ability to destroy our missiles an intolerable threat to us ? GAMALIEL ISAAC Irvington , N.Y. , June 1 , 1979 To the Editor : In reply to Brian Mead 's recent letter on his disaffection with the current usage of Celsius in lieu of centigrade : The Celsius and Fahrenheit scales are so called in honor of the scientists who invented them . In 1742 Anders Celsius ( yes , an astronomer ) chose as two fixed and reproducible points for thermometry the melting point of ice and the boiling point of water . The distance between he divided into 100 degrees ; thus this is a centigrade scale . It has always been called the Celsius. scale throughout the scientific world except in the U.S. , Great Britain and Italy . Finally , in 1948 , at the General Conference of Weights and Measures , Celsius was formally adopted as the universal name . Gabriel Fahrenheit , a physicist , about 30 years before Celsius , selected as his two fixed points the coldest temperature he could achieve in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the human body . This range he divided into 96 degrees , body temperature registering as 96 . Thus , if Dr. Fahrenheit had been running a few degrees of fever or had chosen to divide his scale into 100 degrees rather than ? 96 , the Fahrenheit scale would also be a centigrade scale , but not the Celsius scale .
