txt For the economy , the Nixon victory means a continuity of the policies by which the administration has tried to strike a balance between the need for growth and the need for stable orices . The immediate outlook for 1973 is excellent . It should be a year of real growth just about matching 1972 's performance ? 6 percent or so real growth , with inflation in the 3 percent area . But looking further , at Mr. Nixon 's whole second term , there are some serious problems to be dealt with : ? The future of wage-price controls . ? The related problems of the size of the federal budget , a possible tax increase , and what to do about welfare . ? The tradeoff between full employment and inflation . ? The persistent foreign trade deficit . A strong gain Whatever the problem , however , the atmosphere in which the second term will begin is vastly improved from four years ago . At that time , after four years of Vietnam buildup , the economy was like an engine that could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to clean out the sludge accumulated from a bad fuel mix . The deliberate slowdown engineered by the Nixon economic team did cool off the overheated engine . The causes of inflation were largely removed . But the psychology that had come with the war was still hanging around in 1971 . Then came the wage-price freeze , followed by the controls program , which has helped to remove at least some of those inflationary expectations . At this point , the U.S. economy is climbing nicely . Some 2.7 million new jobs have been added in the past year , corporate profits are recovering well , and consumer buying intentions make it look as if there will be a strong and long period of growth ahead . Thus , whatever problems the new administration faces in January are in one sense less staggering than the engine-on-fire economy it inherited from Lyndon Johnson . Controls in question As for those problems : Mr. Nixon will have to decide well before April 30 ( when controls expire ) what to do about further controls . Many economists point out that controls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them for more than a short period of time . If the causes of inflation have indeed been removed and controls have had their psychological effect , let them go , this argument runs . // *Nixon still faces inflation/jobs thicket // On the other hand , with 1973 a year of major labor bargaining , controls might help simplify the contract-talks period in several industries . But if business want this extra measure of " protection " for 1973 , it will have to expect stiff regulation of prices for another year as a quid pro quo . Which way Mr. Nixon turns will tell something about how free he hopes to make the economy again . Two of his chief economic advisers , Charles Shultz , Treasury Secretary , and Herbert Stein , chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers , have been skeptics about a controlled economy . It may depend how much Mr. Nixon listens to his old friend Arthur Burns , chairman of the Federal Reserve Board . It was Dr. Burns who first advocated the use of controls to the President . Bureaucracy faces trims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ welfare are all tied together . Many think the President genuinely believes the growth of the federal bureacracy must be halted . According to this line of thought , his insistence on a $250 billion budget ceiling and his talk about giving more power to the people and to local government were not mere campaign oratory , but a strong hint of what he intends to do in his second term . ? There promise to be some major fights in the budget and taxation areas . For one thing , the prerogatives of Congress are involved . From the left , the administration will be accused of a willingness to spend for guns but not for people . The view from the other side is that many of the 1960 's programs did n't work well , that revenue sharing opens the way for the states to solve their own problems and for the federal budget to decrease , and that there has to be some check on the tendency of all federal departments and programs to grow . There is a tendency , both in the federal bureaucracy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always for one 's particular spending program . But with a tax increase the only apparent way to pay for a further increase in the budget , there will be the strongest pressures ever from the administration to actually hold the line on spending . At some point , as the economic situation continues to improve , the administration will also have to , face the inflation-jobs tradeoff . That is , a jobless rate below a certain level seems to encourage inflation . Mr. Nixon 's team has already been criticized for being insensitive to the jobs issue : Yet , with stability important both for the continuation of the boom and for the strength of the dollar overseas , it has , perhaps , to seek a new tradeoff point somewhere above the old 4 percent unemployment level that used to signal the danger point for inflation : Trade account lags Hard choices may also be ahead in the foreign field . The turnaround in the trade account that was expected following the U.S. dollar 's devaluation has yet occurred . There is increing pressure to limit the flow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abroad . ' Either kind of action , though , would be contrary to the nation 's position as economic leader and the free world 's banker . In 1969 the economic engine was on fire . By 1970 there was danger of its stalling in the desert . Today it 's just chugging along comfortably on a manageable upgrade . There may be no trouble in the engine itself in the next four years , but there may be some rough roadbed as the Nixon crew negitiates some of the options ahead .
