THE MOLECULE MEN by SIR FRED HOYLE and GEOFFREY HOYLE <P> 255 pages . Harper &; Row . $5.95 . <P> Intellectual sightseers being guided around Cambridge , where one of the three-star attractions is Sir Fred Hoyle and his Institute for Theoretical Astronomy , are likely to be told a cautionary anecdote . It is the science don 's equivalent of the Little Princes in the Tower . One day , goes the tale , a colleague rushed to Hoyle with the incomprehensible datum that variable star Alpha , though 1,000 times larger than star Beta , was pulsing 1,000 times faster . " Oh , but there 's no mystery ; the reason is obvious , " said Hoyle , and proceeded to explain it . His colleague went away awed , only to burst in again to say the mystery was deeper than ever , because he had strained his datum ; it was really Beta vibrating 1,000 times faster than Alpha . " Oh , but there 's no mystery , " Hoyle instantly replies . " The reason is obvious . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most celebrated astrophysicist , not only because of the reach of his knowledge and intuition , but because of the outrageous speed of his cosmological imagination . Several times Hoyle 's exuberance has boiled over into fiction , including The Black Cloud and Rockets in Ursa Major - the latter written in collaboration with his son Geoffrey , as are the two long short stories in this book . <P> The title story , The Molecule Men , is the better of the two . What if a form of life existed that could modify its own genetic message , deliberately and with the speed and flexibility , say , of Fred Hoyle 's imagination ? What if such a protean protein were invading Earth ? This is the fear that seizes Dr. John West , Cambridge scientist , as he sees a bank robber on trial at the Old Bailey turn himself into a swarm of malevolent bees . Soon after , the bees become a pack of ravening wolves and then , successively , a series of the earth 's largest life forms : an elephant leading a protest march @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Penultimately , the invading quick-change alien becomes simultaneously the British Prime Minister , the Presidents of the U.S. and U.S.S.R. , and Chairman Mao . But as the creature changes , it learns not only earth biology but politics and catches up , with deadly irony , to Dr. West 's ( and Hoyle 's ) own belief that scientists and technologists , not politicians , hold the real power . <P> The second story , whose " What if ? " begins at the bottom of Loch Ness , is hardly more than a vehicle for an affectionate Highlands scene-and-character sketchbook . But the Hoyle stories are the playthings of genius . Because they carry around no portentous sociological baggage , the Hoyles are all the more effective at the classical task of science fiction , which is to satirize grotesque social reality in the mirror of scientific possibility . More than that , the tales have that rarest of qualities in fiction , science or otherwise : gaiety.                    @
