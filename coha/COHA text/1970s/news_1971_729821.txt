txt The Democratic plan for financing the 1972 Presidential campaign with Federal tax revenue was dropped today by a SenateHouse conference committee at the suggestion of Representative Wilbur D. Mills . How . ever , the panel , in approving the tax bill , included the concept for later Presidential campaigns . Mr. Mills , the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee , had assured party leaders that he would support the plan for a $1 voluntary income tax checkoff designed to yield a $20.4-million fund for each major party candidate in next year 's national election . But today the Arkansas Democrat offered a substitute compromise plan of his own , which would postpone any public campaign funding until the 1976 election at the earliest and make the money conditional on a second Congressional vote . Early Passage Expected The conferees , in adopting the Mills proposal , completed work on the $26-billion tax reduction bill that is an integral part of President Nixon 's economic program . The conference report is expected to win final approval in both houses next week and then be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ronald L. Ziegler , indicated strongly late today that Mr. Nixon now would sign the measure with its new compromise campaign plan and then rely ' on other efforts to prevent any future use of public funds for political purposes . Democratic leaders were stunned by the conference committee 's action on their campaign plan , which was in the Senate version but not the House version of the tax bill . They had been confident until early afternoon that the conferees would keep the 1972 checkoff intact despite President Nixon 's repeated threat of a veto . In political terms , the Democrats avoided the possibility of being blamed for holding back economic recovery by forcing a tax bill veto . But they avoided this at the expense of never knowing whether the President had bluffed them into backing down on their campaign plan . Less than an hour after the tax conference broke up , four potential and actual Democratic Presidential candidates met in the Capitol with the party 's national chairman , Lawrence F. O'Brien , and they all expressed dismay over the conferees ' not approving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. O'Brien called it " deplorable " and " intolerable " that the President had succeeded in derailing the campaign pro- , posal . He said Mr. Nixon 's opposition to the proposal was based on " an overriding fear of the American people participating in this process . " Senator George of South Dakota said that opponents of the campaign plan " have deprived us of a healthy and wholesome way of seeking funds for all the candidates in 1972 . " Senator Edmund S. Muskie of Maine accused the opposition of " a serious disservice to the people of this country . " Other objectors were Senators Henry M. Jackson of Washington and Hubert H. Humphrey of Minnesota . None of the Democrats were critical of Representative Mills 's leadership role in the conference decision , which did not become clear until later in the afternoon . Twice Mr. O'Brien sidestepped questions as to whether he had received a commitment from Mr. Mills to put the original checkoff plan through the conference committee . Mr. Mills was asked later if he had proposed the compromise in conference because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan would have been defeated on the House floor . " It looked like it to me , " he replied , The Ways and Means chairman said he did not believe that the tax bill should be vetoed under any circumstances and that he had become convinced the President would veto it if it contained the 1972 campaign financing plan. - Mr. Mills denied that he had been acting in response to Any communication from the White House . " They have n't talked to me about anything for months , " he said . He said that the checkoff could not have been included on 1972 income tax forms because they were already printed and thus no money could be accumulated for newt year 's national campaign . In debate , supporters of the plan said an extra slip could be included with the forms . Under the original plan , tax-I payers would check off a box , on their tax forms if they ' wished , indicating whether they , wanted $1 of their regular payment to go to a specified political party or to a nonpartisan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Candidates Presidential candidates would have the option of accepting public financing ? up to $20.4-million for each major party nominee for the entire general election  --  and agreeing not to raise or spend any private money . Candidates who selected private financing would not be subject to any limit . Under the Mills compromise , the tax checkoff would not begin until 1973 , and no money could be paid to Presidential nominees in 1976 unless Congress approved another bill specifically appropriating the money . At the White House , Mr. Ziegler said : " The President will use whatever legislative procedure he feels is most effective to make sure that the checkoff system is not implemented . We still have to take a look at the provisions as it has come out of conference . " " There are several legislative avenues still open , " the press secretary continued . " The House could instruct their conferees to strike the provision from the tax bill , or it could be repealed during the next session . Or , another step , the President , whoever he is , could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tool is most effective to make sure it is not implemented . " During the Senate debate , the Democrats argued that public funding of campaigns was essential to remove the influence of wealthy private contributors and to insure that all contenders were judged on their merits rather than on their personal fortunes or their ability to attract large donations . In reply , the Republicans called public campaign funding " a raid on the Treasury " and said that political candidates should follow the traditional system of winning the backing of contributors as they did of voters . Behind this public reasoning were the underlying political facts that the Democratic party is $9.3-million in debt and having trouble meeting current bills , while the Republican party is solvent and confident of its ability to raise a multimillion-dollar campaign fund for Mr. Nixon . The Mills compromise retained from the original a new income tax credit of $12.50 for a single person or $25 for a couple for individual political contributions of $50 . Alternatively , a single taxpayer could deduct from his taxable income up to $50 in political contributions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
