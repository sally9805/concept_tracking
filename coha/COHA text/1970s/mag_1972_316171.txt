AFTER a relatively strong showing in the first three months of this year , the U.S. economy sailed into the second quarter under a rainbow of brightening statistics-and several ominous clouds . Chances for a rapid return to full , noninflationary prosperity remain remote . And the potential for trouble ahead , notably in the critical areas of jobs and prices , gives Richard Nixon scant room for comfort in an election year . Yet there is compelling evidence that the economy is making sturdy progress toward recovery , and is likely to gain speed in the months ahead . Says Arthur Okun , a member of TIME 'S Board of Economists : " The news that the economy is moving at a good clip now is a fact , not a forecast . " <P> The economy is climbing right along the path to the $95 to $100 billion advance in gross national product that has been widely projected for the full year . Preliminary estimates put the growth in G.N.P . during the first quarter at $28 to $30 billion . At an annual rate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , almost half of the increase resulted from price rises . To reach the Administration 's goals for the year , the rate of inflation will have to be cut sharply , but real growth will have to continue at the same brisk pace , or even slightly faster . <P> Investment Up . Signs of improvement are proliferating . The latest Government survey shows that businessmen plan to increase their spending for plant and equipment this year by 10.5% , v. 1.9% last year . Demand is expanding for capital goods , notably trucks and machine tools . The industrial production index jumped in February for the sixth consecutive month , and a rising tide of manufacturers ' orders all but ensures further gains . A flurry of Government and private contracts is energizing the long depressed aerospace industry . Housing starts remain zesty , at an annual rate of 2,500,000 units in recent months . Though this pace is unlikely to continue , builders anticipate that they will wind up the year well ahead of the record-breaking 2,000,000 houses and apartments begun in 1971 . The stock market has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dow Jones industrial average jumped 21 points , closing at 962.60 , a three-year high . <P> Consumer spending , the most potent force for expansion , is the weakest indicator so far . The latest index of consumer sentiment compiled by the University of Michigan notes that people are now more confident than in recent months about the prospects of the economy in general , but expectations for their own personal finances are no better than they were in the final quarter of last year . Consumer buying edged up .2% in January over the previous month , and then down .2% in February . Though March Easter sales ballooned in volume at most major stores , there is little evidence yet of a sustained buying surge . <P> Spending has been held back in part because of a colossal blooper by the <P> House Ways and Means Committee in setting the new withholding rates . Because last year 's withholding was too low , the Government boosted the rates this year-and boosted them too high . As a result , taxpayers are missing an estimated $4 billion to $6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that reduces willingness to spend . More important , many people are still worried about losing their jobs .
