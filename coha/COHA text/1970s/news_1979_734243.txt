txt Donald Harms still seemed shaken when he pulled his big tractor-trailer rig loaded with hogs into the Pierce Packing Company yards here , a half-day behind schedule . Mr. Harms , a big , heavyset 30-yearold driver , is not accustomed to fearing confrontations , but he admitted that he was intimidated when 30 protesting truckers swarmed onto a highway in Rapid City , S.D. , impounded his truck overnight and released some of his hogs . " It gave me a bad feeling , " Mr. Harms said . " I could n't believe truckers would do that to another trucker . " But the big driver arrived to a hero 's welcome at Pierce Packing , whose stainless-steel tables , knives , conveyors and 91 slaughterers were standing idle , waiting for his load . The plant is one of a number of businesses here that , like many in other Montana cities and in scattered cities and towns elsewhere , are beginning to feel the pinch of a shutdown movement among independent truckers . The independents carry most of the country 's raw foodstuffs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consigned to railroads . And if their pro- test ; continues , it is expected to have a wide . impact on food supplies , possibly ' leading to shortages in some areas and certainly driving prices even higher , thus ' undermining an optimistic Agriculture Department report earlier this week that predicted a leveling of retail food prices . Montana , which relies more on trucking than do most other states , appears to bethe hardest hit by the protest so far . About half its truckers are independents , according to local estimates , and it is among the states squeezed most by shortages of diesel oil , the fuel needed for their big trucks . Some business executives say they are facing the threat of plant layoffs . Independent truckers are protesting both fuel shortages and the rapidly rising price of diesel oil . But , according to truckers interviewed here , those problems have set off an outpouring of longsmouldering resentments stemming from a hodgepodge of state licensing , weight , length and fuel-tax laws that the truckers meet on their cross-country runs . And allocation procedures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fuel for truckers . The economic impact that the truckers ' pretest has had on other Montana cities , such as Missoula , Helena , Butte and Great Falls , can be seen here in Billings . Pierce Packing , for example , has been unable to find enough drivers to haul the hogs that John Harris , its buyer , purchases to keep the plant operating at full speed . The plant is now working at about half capacity , with the slaughter crew arriving about an hour late , quitting about two hours early and often standing idle . ' Ca n't Find Enough Truckers ' " The hogs are out there , " said Kenneth A. Poggi , president of the company . " We just ca n't find enough truckers willing to bring them in . ' " We 're losing about $6,000 a day , " Mr. Poggi continued . " We 're going to have to take a hard look tomorrow to see how many people we can use next week . " , Empire Packing Company , also in Billings , specializes in beef @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said yesterday , with no trucks available to haul it to customers and none to bring in more cattle . Midland Empire , too , may have to lay off some of its workers , the executive said . Truck Stop Shut Down Not the least of the area 's worriers is Steven Adams , a partner with his father in a truck-stop at Laurel , a suburb of Billings , who shut down his diesel pumps in sympathy ' with the truckers . Shutting down , he said , was not much of a hardship because , with the month only half gone , he had only 20,000 gallons left out of a June allocation of 200,000 gallons a cutback of 30 percent below his sales for last June . " At that rate , " he said , " we were already losing money . " Mr. Adams said he could sympathize with his customers , men like Richard , who had just dropped in for some repair work . " You want to know what we truckers are angry about ? " asked Mr. , jotting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with the cost of diesel fuel up about 30 cents a gallon since April 1 , he was spending $250 more on each weekly run to the West Coast , carrying meat out and bringing produce back . Despite a recent increase in freight rates , he said , the $1,200 to $1,500 a month that he had been earning had been cut by about $600 . " We 're not making a living now , " he said , " and the costs are jumping every day . They 're eating us alive . " Meanwhile , Mr. Harris , in addition to his purchasing , is spending his evenings trying to find drivers . Some of those he reaches , he said , have parked their rigs in sympathy with the truckers ' shutdown , but most say they are afraid to go out on the road , where a thrown brick , a " paint bomb " or a shotgun blast at a fuel tank can spell disaster . " Some of the fellows who kept driving have had calls in the middle of the night , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " But you can find some that keep on driving anyway .
