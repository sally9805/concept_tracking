Most rock bands enthusiastically imitate one another . Small wonder , then , that an original and distinctive group like Santana has taken flight like a Poseidon missile exploding out of a sea of mediocrity . Santana triples the basic rhythmic element of rock . Flailing away in the midst of a dozen percussion instruments , three players pound out different sets of rhythms until the beats converge into an orgy of machine-like energy . What makes Santana unique is the fusion of rhythms : African , Cuban , Mexican , blues , as well as subtle Latin ingredients whose exotic sound has rarely been heard in rock . <P> There is nothing simple about Santana 's music . The group 's second recording , Abraxas , released this week by Columbia Records , shows less propulsive violence than the first , Santana . What it offers instead is a rare poetic delicacy . Rhythms move in parallel layers , interrupting , overlaying , penetrating one another , multiplying into mathematical complexity , finally merging into one overwhelming musical thrust . Unlike many rock groups , Santana uses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bite . Though it offers an occasional vocal solo ( as in the bluesy Hope You 're Feeling Better ) , most of its featured solos are on electric guitar , organ or electric piano . Outwardly innocent , Santana 's instrumental solos are long-lined and full of musical guile , bending , flatting and sharping with something of the intricacy of Oriental music . <P> The group got started in San Francisco about four years ago . It included Pianist-Organist Gregg Rolie , Guitarist Carlos Santana , Bass Guitarist Dave Brown and two others now departed . At first they called themselves the Santana Blues Band and were the idol of San Francisco 's heavily Spanish Mission District . In early 1969 , they were joined by Jose Areas ( conga drums , trumpet , timbales ) , Mike Carrabello ( conga drums ) and Mike Shrieve ( drums ) . From the beginning , the group has been managed by a music-struck local barber named Stan Marcum . <P> Explains Carrabello : " Stan sold his clothes for us . He went out and cut hair while we all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into it . " Two years ago , they achieved star billing at the fabled Fillmore West without ever having made a record . They played at Woodstock last summer ; their performance in the subsequent documentary movie-with Shrieve on drums - is one of the longest and most arresting single acts presented . A year ago , Columbia Records released the first Santana album . So far it has sold 2,000 , - 000 copies and has earned the group $300,000 in royalties . <P> Street Kids . After an appearance at Tanglewood last month , Gregg Rolie listened to the shrieks coming from the crowd of 17,432 packing the Music Shed and spilling over the lawns . " That 's what <P> 1 want to hear , " he said . " There are symphony people out there . " The group follows a heavy rehearsing and concert schedule . Says Drummer Shrieve : " When we do n't have anything to do , we go to somebody 's house and play music . We do n't consider ourselves a rock-and-roll group even , " he adds . " We 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make it into music and let it go . "
