John Brennan 's career at Ford Motor Co. seemed to be a classic American success story . In 31 years with the automaker , Brennan , now 56 , rose from unskilled laborer through a variety of sales and administrative posts to chairman of Ford of Switzerland . His jobs involved attendance at endless rounds of lunches and social affairs , most of them bibulous . Consuming more and more liquor on the way up , Brennan became an alcoholic , subject to recurrent blackouts . Finally , five years ago , he took early retirement from Ford . Now he is suing the company for $1.3 million , contending that his job environment started him down the road to alcoholism and the company persuaded him to take early retirement rather than helping him to rehabilitate himself . <P> As Brennan tells it , he began drinking seriously in Washington in 1950 while representing Ford . Later , he maintained liaison for Ford at the United Nations , where he put in hours at the delegates ' bar , " followed by long martini lunches . " Brennan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more social drinking - Austria , where he started drinking alone , and finally Switzerland . When he at last sought help , Brennan says , he was met in a Zurich hotel room by higher Ford officials who persuaded him- " over a bottle of Johnnie Walker Black Label " - to take early retirement . <P> Kicked Habit . Ford says that it intends to " defend the suit vigorously " ; presumably , it will contend that other executives have operated in the same environment without becoming alcoholics . Brennan 's weightiest charge is that , although Ford had helped other alcoholic employees in the U.S. get treatment , he was never even told that such help was available . After a long struggle , Brennan kicked the drinking habit-so successfully that he is now business manager of an alcoholic-treatment center in Lake Orion , near Detroit .
