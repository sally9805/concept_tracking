txt Letters to the Editor pg . 38 Letters to the Editor Election ' 76 : The Unfashionable Ideals To the Editor : It is the ? year of the 200th birthday of the United States . We admit to being proud of what began in 1776 and we hold those who started it in high esteem . One wonders , however , how the Founding Fathers might be received if they were running for the Presidency in 1976 . The Founding Fathers were men with an openly expressed idealistic vision . Perhaps this alone would deny them serious consideration in this year 's election . The framers of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution were intellectuals of the first order . They had a keen sense of history and talked a. great deal about philosophical and political concepts born beyond our borders . Because we are rather distrustful of intellectuals who talk about new or foreign ideas , I suppose Jefferson and Adams would n't get beyond the first primary . The founders of our country were political revolutionaries . Would we select these types to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States were radical and nonconformists . Which state primary could a radical or nonconformist win in 1976 ? The fathers of our country led the world movement against status , privilege and power . I suppose their campaigns would quickly run out of funds in 1976 ; and is it possible that middle-class America would identify politicians with such ideas as subversives ? It is not only the year of our 200th birthday , it is a year in which we will elect a President . One would hope that some of the traits of our founders would be evident in those pursuing the Generous City Hall To the Editor : Another case of whose ox is being gored  --  or fattened . The unmitigated gall of Mayor Beame to permit raises to his own staff ? in one case by $6,294 ( news story May 4 ) ? in the face of a wage freeze is another glaring example of how the powerful take care of their own and the devil take the hindmost when it comes to those whose problem is survival . I am unimpressed by his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The highly paid are expected to work extra hard and extra hours ; that 's one justification for fat salaries . The dedicated do it for little or nothing all the time . I call again on the Mayor to set a top salary of $30,000 for any city employee , he being paid at that level , to reduce all who are now paid more than $30,000 to $29,999 and to reduce on a graduated basis all salaries between $15,000 and $29,999 . All provisionals should go . Cutting out all overtime pay and calling in laid-off workers when extra help is absolutely necessary would help both the budget and the unemployment rate . This combination would not only ? save some of our precious dollars but would let the disenchanted of our city know that the Mayor is no longer telling the poor that it is only they who must tighten their belts . MARIE M. RuNTON Assemblywoman , 70th Dist. , N. Y. Albany , May 4 , 1976 ? $92 Billion B-1 To the Editor : It was most gratifying to see The Times ' recent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cite , however , is only for building the bombers . When one figures in the cost of a supersonic refueling fleet , bombs , pilots , maintenance , etc. ( all of which are indispensable for the effective operation of the B-1 ) over the system 's useful lifetime , the figure is an unbelievable $92 billion , Consider what crime- and pollutionfree meccas our cities could become with this money if it were used wisely . Consider the tens of thousands of extra jobs created by the use of this money in the fields of health , education , housing and general construction , where close to 80,000 jobs are created per billion dollar expenditure , as compared to a mere 52,000 by similar defense spending . ( For $92 billion , that 's 276,000 job years . ) Consider the joy of our " enemies " when they see us pour money into an obsolete bomber rather than raising our quality of life and increasing our foreign aid . Consider the vital ozone layer that permits life to exist on earth and its destruction , not by just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per year but by a fleet of 244 supersonic bombers logging 100 , - 000 hours per year flight time altogether . Consider finally the motives of , the major promoter of the B-1 system , Rockwell International , whose chairman said : " We knew that as a Nark Podwal highest office in the land . But then , how long would Ford , Reagan , Jackson , Carter or Udall last if they were to be as idealistic , as elevated in rhetoric , as revolutionary , as concerned about the entire world , as anticolonialist ; as against privilege and Status , as promotive of the outcast , as opinionated about equality , as receptive of fugitives and as committed to self-determination everywhere as were the men of 1776 ? Perhaps the ideas of 1776 would be dismissed ( in campaign 1976 ) as nuisances . It 's more likely that they would be turned off as too threatening . Perhaps it 's even more likely that they would be thought un-American . We have come a long way since 1776 , but ? in some ways we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It would be heartening if those wishing to be the founding fathers of the next 100 years would cease following us and dare to lead , regardless of the conseqtiences . DoNovAN W. RUSSELL Raleigh , N.C. , April 28 , 1976 company we had just one more chance  --  the B-1 . " Given these considerations , I concur with and commend you wholeheartedly on your decision to oppose the B-1 . MICHAEL J. MCFADDEN Philadelphia , May 2 , 1976 ? On Teaching History To the Editor : The report on The New York Times American History Knowledge Survey ( May 2-4 ) is an important addition to the ongoing debate on the role and responsibility of history courses in public schools . To construe the issue in terms of courses that teach " facts " versus courses that teach " concepts " is misleading , however , for it assumes a dichotomy between data and ideas that is false . Any decent history course , whether survey or thematic , recognizes that historical facts take on meaning only within the broader context , and also that concepts in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grounded in. substantive detail . Moreover , the weaknesses in the historical understanding of students which the survey reveals ? an awareness of continuity , a sense of chronology , an ability to analyze changes in historical phenomena over ? timewill he strengthened only by history courses which address these , goals within the perspective of adolescent development and the still-developing capacity of adolescents to come to grips with continuity and change in their own past and present lives as well as in the history of their society . ( Asst . Prof. ) MARTIN E. SLEEPER Department of Education Wellesley College Wellesley , Mass. , May 5 , 1976 ? Leaves and Priorities To the Editor : What has happened to your priorities ? On May 3 , a day after more than 200,000 demonstrated against Soviet oppression , you editorialize on the leaves and flowers of spring . Should it not be the season of freedom as well ? Shame . WILLIAM L. SILBER New York , May 4 , 1976 ? To the Editor : After reading your May 3 editorial " The New Leaves " I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed the subjects of your previous editorials had always been of world importance . I thought you were writing about the budding of leaves for lack of anything better . I then realized that a prestigious newspaper such as The Times had taken time out from bombings , plane crashes , wars , politics , death and other " important " subjects to take a look at one thing that God , not man , has created  --  nature . Possibly now , people will come to appreciate it more and take care to preserve it . I thank you . JOHN O'HANLON Deer Park , LI. , May 3 , 1976 U.S. and the Cflinal To the Editor : The April 17 editorial implies the American presence in Panama is unreasonable , and Mr. Ford ; through Dr. Kissinger , is somehow justified in illegally bypassing the Congress in attempting to dispose of American property . Since facts are difficult to obtain through a throttled Panamanian press , perhaps I can supply a few : In the 1903 treaty , the U.S. acquired full sovereign rights , power and authority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million . Then we obtained title to each individual tract , from Atlantic to Pacific , by purchase from each private owner . We paid for it twice . Its $7 billion cost to date makes it the most expensive land acquisition in our history . General Torrijos is not the benevolent shepherd of Panamanian destiny you portray . His corrupt military dictatorship has proven worldwide drug smuggling connections , and he has allowed only the Communist Party ? to operate in Panama . Torrijos militarily seized the American-owned electric and bus companies , forcing the power company 's sale at a $65 million loss and holding buses in " protective custody . " The same Torrijos , asked what would happen if the U.S. does not withdraw from the canal soon , said , " Then we would have to walk the Ho Chi Minh trail . It is long , and exerts a heavy toll in blood . " And Torrijos flaunts Castro 's support of his " straggle against the imperialists , " presumably in the same fashion Castro supported the Angolan crisis . Ellsworth Bunker and O.A.S @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1964 riots , and attempts by the Panamanian Government to incite those riots , in the official policy organ , the State Department Bulletin . No less than six treaties have confirmed American sovereignty in the Canal Zone . We paid tor it twice , and then built the canal when no other nation could or cared to . We support it with $200 million in annual aid . In 1967 , House Minority Leader Gerald Ford said attempts to give away the canal were " shocking , " and that " the Communist threat to the canal is a real danger . " the only difference in nine years is that Dr. Kissinger 's rather strange approach to Central American diplomacy has forced Mr. Ford to abandon his responsibility to the American people by his =defendable stance of a canal giveway . JOHN M. MURPHY Member of Congress , 17th Dist. , N.Y . Washington , May 4 , .1976 ? To the Editor : I am a retired Foreign Service officer who served a total of five years at the United States Embassy in Pam , ma . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the canal negotiations . The opponents of change proceed from a false premise . They assume that the American people are faced with a choice between maintaining the status quo , by force if necessary , and giving up our interests on the isthmus . The status quo will not remain static , no matter what arguments , . pressures , threats or force we employ. , Continued resistance to modernizing our relations with Panama will engender further reaction in Panama . It could well take the form of riots and other violence with consequent bloodshed , as President Ford has implied . What would we do in the event of a general strike by the non-U.S . employees , most of them Panamanian , of the Panama Canal Company , who numbered more than 9,000 as of last June 30 ? ( The number of U.S. employees was less than 2,500 . ) Use U.S. troops to operate the canal ? Prohibit entry by Panamanians into the Canal Zone and their transit across it from one part of the republic to another ? Erect a hundred miles of barbed-wire fences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we should eventually be forced to back down in circumstances unpropitious for the future of the canal . The President and Secretary Kissinger have said that in the event of a confrontation with Panama no Latin American nation would support us . They are right , but they understate the case . Does anyone seriously think , for example , that a single NATO ally would side with us ? Or any other country anywhere in the world ? The choice of the status quo is not open to us . Our only option is to seek a modernized partnership with Panama . To the extent we move ungrudgingly in that direction , we will preserve our vital interests , the canal will continue to serve American shipping and the world 's commerce , we will be true to our principles and we will earn the respect of others . To do otherwise would be folly . We would damage vital national interests , and we would stand isolated and friendless . RuEUS Z. SMITH Annandale , Va. , May 2 , 1976 ? On Rockefeller 's Apology ? To the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can call Nelson Rockefeller 's apology to Senator Jackson " handsome " editorial April 29 . Caught red-handed once again in a nasty , shoddy campaign activity ? this time with-m:1 brother handy to shoulder the blame , as in the attack on Arthur Goldberg a few years ago  --  with the Senate about to air the whole odoriferous performance , he apologized . It trot only ' was n't handsome , it was barely decent . CLARICE BROWS THORP Amherst , Mass. , May 3 , 1976
