 | Winners or losers ? Energy experts evaluate 13 wind machines @# @# As you read this , the conventional propeller is king in harnessing energy from the wind . But the day may come when it is overthrown by a few electrically charged drops of water , a spinning tower on a flatbed railroad car , a huge tower with a relatively small rotor inside , or a machine that looks like a giant upsidedown eggbeater . For the time being , however , the conventional , horizontal-axis wind-energy conversion system ( WECS ) is hogging the spotlight . In the July ' 74 issue , PS reported on the Department of Energy 's ( at that time NASA/NSF 's ) Mod-O prototype 125-ft. - dia. propelleiil type mill erected in Sandusky , Ohio . A production model of that turbine is now delivering 200 kW in Clayton , N.M . A larger version , with 200-ft. blades , will generate 2000 kW on a mountaintop site near Boone , N.C. , within the next few months . Still to come is a 2500-kW model , whose blades @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people at DOE 's Wind Energy Systems Branch , who are funding the development of many strange wind concepts , admit that the odds ' of successfully challenging these large propeller wind generators are slim . But 70 POPULAR SCIENCE the money flows nonetheless in the hope that from the dark-horse pack a big winner will emerge . As Dr. Peter Moretti , who oversees the advanced wind-concepts program at DOE , puts it , " We 're trying to cover all of our bets and look for a breakthrough to be sure we do n't miss anything . " While DOE is hedging its wind-energy bets , it is not doing so like a wild-eyed gambler . Louis Divone , head of DOE 's windenergy program , explained the philosophy : " The risks one takes are proportional to the possible improvement . If the concept looks like it will improve the output only 10 percent , we would have to be very sure it will work before we invest the funds in it . But , " he added , " if it looks like it will double @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more of a gamble . " Summing up his department 's quest for a better wind trap , Divone told me , " Basically anything will work . Any asymmetrical device you can make rotate , translate , or oscillate can generate electricity , run pumps , air compressors , and so on . It 's how much power you can get in what wind for how much money . That 's the key question . " All of the seemingly oddball approaches aimed at beating the wind-energy odds can be placed in four categories : vertical-axis windmills ; augmenter windmills ; windmills that are low in cost ; and , finally , the " far-out " concepts . In all , 13 different designs are now being funded by DOE , and they 're all described in the following pages . VERTICAL-AXIS WIDVILLS Of all the advanced concepts , t vertical-axis machines are conside ' by many experts to hold the m promise . The primary advantage these designs is that , unlike horizon axis windmills , they do not require yaw control to turn the machine into away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by no means a new design . French inventor G. J. M Darrieus applied for a U.S. patent on his vertical-wind-machine idea n 1925 , and a patent was granted s a years later . The design then languished for some 45 years until it was red s covered by the National ResearcCouncil , Ottawa , Canada , during t-w early 1970 's . In 1974 engineers at Sandia Laboratories , Albuquerque , N.M also started work on the Darrieus co -- cept PS , May ' 75 . Its blade is shaped much like aaircraft wing with the leading edge slightly thicker than the trailing edge In the case of an airplane , aerody  | namic forces acting on this airfoil provide lift . With the Darrieus wind turbine , the airfoil drives the blades into the wind regardless of its direction . Each Darrieus blade is curved in the symmetrical shape a rope would take if spun around a vertical axis . A major advantage of the Darrieus design is that the blades do not require a variable-pitch mechanism to protect them from damage in high winds . To strike a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obtain power from winds within certain speed ranges . When wind speed exceeds the maximum that the mill is designed to handle , the propeller feathers ( is positioned at an angle to the wind so that it no longer turns ) . If this did not occur , the propeller would continue to speed up and the machine would eventually be destroyed . Because of their aerodynamic characteristics , the Darrieus blades go into a stall in high winds . But while the Darrieus windmill has this positive no-pitch characteristic , it will not start itself like a horizontal-axis machine does . Just like an airplane 's wings , Darrieus blades will not create lift until brought up to - speed . A starter is needed to get the thing going . In the latest Sandia mills , the generator doubles as a starter . There are other trade-offs between the Darrieus and conventional wind turbines . On the pro-Darrieus side , the machine delivers mechanical power to the base of the shaft , allowing heavy power-generating equipment to sit on the ground . With horizontal machines the generator is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a heavier , more costly tower . On the negative side , the Darrieus tends to run at lower rpm than horizontal-axis machines . This property requires more costly transmissions . Probably the biggest strike against the Darrieus , though , is the fact that it has a somewhat lower aerodynamic efficiency than conventional machines . Dr. Richard Braasch , Sandia 's advanced-energy-projects division supervisor , puts the problem this way : " If you have lower efficiency and lower cost , does the cost go down lower than the efficiency ? " While no one knows for sure , " all studies to date suggest that cost will go down more rapidly than efficiency , " says Braasch . Currently , Sandia has three Darrieus machines up and running . One . is about six feet in diameter , another 15 feet , and the largest is 55 feet in diameter . In each case , the height is about equal to the diameter . The largest one produces 60 kilowatts of electricity in a 28-mph wind , and 30 kilowatts in a 22-mph wind . ( Alcoa was recently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) Cyclogyro Another vertical-axis-type machine is the cyclogyro . One model is currently on the market for a breezy $5500 , plus tower , which runs about $1000 . The cyclogyro has straight , variablepitch blades that give it several advantages over the Darrieus . First , it is a self-starter . Second , controlling the pitch permits the extraction of a greater amount of power . Wind-tunnel tests indicate that the cyclogyro has a better power coefficient ( greater efficiency ) than the Darrieus at lower rpm . The straight cyclogyro blades may also be cheaper to manufacture . The unit now on the market has three eight-foot-tall blades with a total diameter of 12 feet . It can produce four  | kilowatts in a 30-mph wind , and two kilowatts in 24 mph . Known as the Cycloturbine , the machine is manufactured by Pinson Energy Corp . ( Marston Mills , Mass . ) . It was designed by Herman Drees , president of Pinson , who while a graduate student at MIT in 1975 received a grant through SCORE ( Student Competition for Relevant Engineering ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firm of Aerospace Systems , Inc. , Burlington , Mass. , have been awarded $365,000 to develop a one-kilowatt version . Another cyclogyro , known as a Gyromill , has been undergoing development for several years by the McDonnell Douglas Corp. , St. Louis , Mo . At present , a wind-tunnel model of this device is in existence . Circulation control Another DOE-funded vertical-axis design goes by the name of Circulation-Controlled Vertical-Axis Wind Turbine . Still in the conceptual stage , this design has the same basic configuration as the cyclogyro , but the rotors are designed to take advantage of a unique STOL ( short takeoff and landing ) aircraft-wing design known as the circulation-control wing . The windturbine concept is being developed by Dr. Richard Walters of West Virginia University 's Department of Aerospace Engineering . Here 's how both the wing and wind turbine rotor work : The trailing edge is rounded instead of having the conventional knife-edge configuration . Highpressure air is blown over this trailing edge . The air adheres to the trailing edge , then shoots off sideways . In the case of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to flow downward , giving increased lift . It is expected that the use of the same configuration on a vertical-axis cyclogyro rotor will both increase the torque ( power ) at a given speed and allow the turbine to operate at a lower optimum speed . Dr. Walters told me , " We can operate slower at higher efficiencies . This is important because it cuts down the centrifugal forces greatly , and it 's structurally easier to build a machine that goes slower . " While an airplane using the circulation-control concept has been built and flown , a wind turbine with such rotors is still on the drawing boards . The configuration Dr. Walters visualizes would pressurize a hollow vertical shaft via a compressor . The pressurized air would be run out to the blades through the struts holding them in place . The air would be fed into the blades and come out through slots . Although some power will have to be sacrificed to drive the compressor , Dr. Walters feels the trade-off will be worthwhile . " Theoretically , we 're looking at an overall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operating at about half the speed of a conventionalblade vertical-axis machine . " The Darrieus gets 20 to 40 percent , while propeller types are operating in the . 40-to 45-percent range . @# @# AUGMENTER WINDVILG The idea behind augmenter machines is to get more out of the propeller . Then the propeller can be shrunk in size , reducing costs . However , additional static structures are usually needed to increase the wind speed the propeller " sees . " It remains to be seen if the cost of these structures will be justified by the reduction in propeller costs . Diffuser augmenter The oldest , and probably the most promising for the near future , is the diffuser-augmented wind turbine undergoing development at Grumman Aerospace Corp. , Bethpage , N.Y . " The idea of ducted wind turbines is over 100 years old , " Dr. Richard Oman of Grumman told me . " It 's been reinvented every 20 years or so , and we 're one of the reinventors . " Under the diffuser concept , a shroud ( static diffuser ) is placed around a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narrow at the point it faces into the wind , and expands as it goes back . This configuration creates a pressure drop behind the rotor blades , causing increased airflow through the propeller . The major problem that developers have encountered is that the airstream has been breaking up as it passes through the diffuser , reducing efficiency . To counter this effect the divergence angles of the diffuser have to be quite small , requiring a costly shroud The Grumman researchers are work ing to design a small yet effective shroud using modern fluid-dynam : techniques . They hope that by putting slots in the diffuser to introduce external air into the internal wall of the diffuser they can counter the tendenc , toward stalling . To date they have conducted wind-tunnel tests showing they can squeeze about 31/2 times the power out of a wind turbine with the diffuser than could be obtained from a conventional rotor . Yet the diffuser must be made strong enough to withstand strong winds . Can that be done at the right price ? " We have yet to prove that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engineering reality for fewer dollars than a conventional machine , " says Dr. Oman . Dynamic inducer To get away from the potential high cost of the diffuser structure , noted aerodynamicist Dr. Peter B. S. Lissaman is working on a dynamic inducer that does much the same with a dynamic ( moving ) apparatus as the Grumman concept does with a static device . The dynamic inducer consists of a small T-shape device appended to the tips of the rotor blades of a conventional horizontal-axis machine . This configuration pushes air out away from the propeller , thereby causing more air to be drawn into the propeller , creating higher efficiency . Relating this design to the diffuser duct , Dr. Lissaman explained that if @# 7 INE VORTEX AUGMENTER DIFFUSER AUGMENTER ' C-VO Ctan tt-xt anc vin tr-tF -- m were to " take the duct and join the speller to it , then cut slices out of duct and throw away the pieces i:ept for the ones that were attached the propeller , he would have these tip vanes on the propeller .

To illustrate this cept , Dr. Lissaman asked me to cider the wing of a small airplane. nas got to produce so much lift , " said . " Now consider the rotor of a copter .

" gut , even with this concept , the fact t you ca n't get something for ing makes itself apparent : It takes er to drive the tip vanes around ause of their drag in the air . The lenge is to minimize that drag . The idea for this wind-energy device miss first conceived by Professor Theoe Van Holten at Delft Institute of , nology , Holland .

Of his work , Dr. Lissa=n says , " We have not proved the concept practical , but we are hopeful . " Vortex augmenter As is often true , the idea for this highly innovative wind-energy concept evolved as the result of work its inventor had been doing on aircraft . Specifically , Dr. Pasquale Sforza , professor of aerospace engineering at Polytechnic Institute of New York , Farmingdale , had been doing research on aircraft wakes . He knew that the passage of air over a wing creates vortices ( whirlwinds ) which contain much kinetic energy . It was Dr. Sforza 's idea to capture this energy by constructing a delta wing on which he would mount two rotors . As the air passes over the wing , vortices are formed , thus concentrating the wind energy before it reaches the rotor .

It has two three-foot-dia. rotors . ( An artist 's concept of that model is featured prominently on this month 's cover . ) Dr. Sforza has been pleased with the results of the experiment so far . There are numerous advantages to this wind-machine design . The augmentation allows deriving more energy from smaller rotors , and rotors are a major part of a wind machine 's cost . Also , because the wind speed seen by the rotors can be varied-by either altering the angle of attack of the wing surface or by controlling a small flap  | one were to " take the duct and join the propeller to it , then cut slices out of the duct and throw away the piecesscept for the ones that were attached ? o the propeller , he would have these little tip vanes on the propeller . " Because these " duct sections " are rotating they need be only about one hundredth the area of the duct to do comparable work .

It is only about one hundredth the area , but it produces the same lift because it 's going around . " But , even with this concept , the fact that you ca n't get something for nothing makes itself apparent : It takes power to drive the tip vanes around because of their drag in the air .

An inexpensive yaw control is another plus . The vertical stabilizer points the wing into the wind . Tornado wind turbine This design is the offspring of Dr. James Yen of the Grumman Aerospace Corp . Bethpage , N.Y . PS , Jan. ' 77 . It is still in the wind-tunnel-test stage , but the inventor of the device predicts that his machine may be able to augment the power in the wind by a factor of up to 1000 . Dr. Yen 's system consists of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the side toward the wind would open while those opposite the flow would close . As the wind blows into the tower it would spiral toward the top , creating a miniature tornado ( vortex ) . In the center of this vortex is a low-pressure area , which would cause outside air to be sucked in through openings around the base of the tower . As this air is sucked in to fill the lowpressure void , it would drive rotor blades near the bottom of the tower . The question with this device , as with all wind energy machines , is economics . With this design , you do n't need a huge 300-foot rotor to extract substantial energy from the wind , but it is necessary to build a huge tower with a small rotor inside . Can the concept be made efficient enough to make the trade-off worthwhile ? No one knows ? yet . For more wind machines , turn page SEPTEMBER 1978 73  | LOW-COST WINDMILLS Two imaginative approaches to harnessing the wind focus on significantly lowering the cost of manufacturing the rotating parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the two is the bearingless-rotor concept being developed by United Technologies Research Center , East Hartford , Conn . The device , attached to a horizontalaxis wind turbine , is nothing more than a flexible rotor with a pendulum attached to each blade to help bend it to the desirable pitch . The inboard section of the blade ( between the hub and the blade proper ) is made of highly flexible carbon epoxy . This concept is now being tested on the tail rotors of two helicopters . " If you arrange the geometry right , you get a very favorable pitch schedule , " Dr. Pam Spierings of United Technologies told me . His company recently received a contract through Rocky Flats DOE 's small-wind-systems program at Golden , Colo. , to develop an eight-kilowatt machine using the bearingless rotor . Eliminating the need for mechanical pitch control could significantly reduce a wind turbine 's cost . Bicycle wheel The bicycle-wheel wind-energy concept seems to be one of those on which DOE gambles and sometimes loses . But losers have been known to come back into the race @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Tom Chalk of American Wind Turbine Co. , based in Nebraska PS , July ' 74 . Shortly thereafter , Oklahoma State University bought a 15-foot-diameter bicyclewheel wind turbine from Chalk 's company and proceeded to design a larger 30-foot-diameter model for testing . The resulting machine has 96 stainlesssteel wire spokes , which support 48 airfoils , each about 10 feet long . The machine served its purpose . Discussing the outcome , Dr. Dennis McLaughlin of OSU said , " We built this big thing and we ran some tests on it . The goals of our work were to design , construct , and evaluate . From my point of view after we were done , I was convinced that the scheme was not a viable design . " As a result , the machine was slated for dismantling within a few weeks of this writing . One big problem : The device presents a lot of rotor to the wind , compared with the two or three blades of a conventional rotor , making high-wind protection difficult . @# Far-Out Windmills This category of designs consists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DOE . Electrofluid dynamic One of the most theoretical of far-out concepts is the electrofluids dynamic ( EFD ) category , with . devices being developed under se .. rate DOE contracts . A fascinating e ment of this concept is that it has moving parts . How does one capture energy from the wind with no moving parts ? Eas .. or so it seems . Making the conceit work in the real world is anot-es matter . In essence , what the EFD device does is reproduce nature 's wav of creating lightning in a thunderstorr " The charged raindrops accumulate in a cloud and form an electric fie When it becomes strong enough get lightning . What I did was bottle this whole phenomenon , " said Alvin Marks , president of Marks Polarizes ' Corp. , Whitestone , N.Y. , the developer of one EFD system . The other is bbeing worked on by Dr. John Minardi of t-e University of Dayton ( Ohio ) . Each of the researchers has built a wind-tunnel test model . Marks has produced one-tenth of a watt with I- s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watts in a 22-mphwind for each square meter of device While their machines differ in design - their methods of producing power through EFD are basically the same . The idea is to have the wind blows water droplets through a high . charged grid , thereby causing the droplets to become charged . The wine would then blow these particles toward  | another charged grid . The mechanical energy of the wind does work in overcoming electrostatic repulsion , and the energy is translated into electrical current . Marks explains it this way : " What we do is inject charged droplets into the windstream . The charge is eventually carried by the wind to the electrical ground , but it has to climb a potential hill to get to ground . " The load is placed between the collector grid and the ground . Work now being done by both Dr. Minardi and Marks is aimed at developing methods of producing charged water droplets . One method being investigated by the Ohio researcher is to use liquid hydrogen for cooling moist air to produce small quid droplets that can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coking into using small water jets which would be shot through an elec. - ical field . Humid air As have the EFD people , a group of - researchers at the South Dakota School of Mines and Technolgy , Rapid City , have taken their cue from nature for developing a wind-energy device . The research done by the team , - leaded by Dr. Thomas Oliver , revolves around the fact that about one-third of the solar energy that reaches the surface of the earth goes into evaporating moisture . So far , Dr. Oliver has been through a series of designs that would capture this energy , but there nave been drawbacks . There was the original natural-draft sower in which humid air would be brought in at the bottom . The wet air , being lighter than dry air , would rise @# @# and would expand , causing its temperature to drop . The cooler air would give off water , and the latent heat in the humid air would be given off to the now drier air . The warmer air would have increased buoyancy and would continue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on its way out . The problem with this idea is that it would require a tower of some 10,000 feet . The next idea was to build a mechanized expansion-compression cycle to boost this natural process and reduce the height of the tower . But some of these designs involved expansion-compression machines that used too much energy . The approach being considered now is a vortex-flow device in which one machine would accomplish both the expansion and compression of the air . Humid air would enter on the upper end of an expansion chamber . The air spirals to a low-pressure area where it could be cooled by a water spray , then go on to a compression chamber . A rotor could be placed in the flow path to extract power . Madaras rotor A train to nowhere , which its developers hope will lead us to energy self-sufficiency , is the key to the Madaras rotor power plant . Named after Julius Madaras , who invented the concept in the 1920 's , this system consists of a circular track with a train of flatcars , each with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motor on each car spins the cylinder like a top . The interaction of the wind with the turning cylinder propels the car down the track . Generators attached to the wheels of the cars produce power , which is taken off by a third rail operating like a conventional electric train , but in reverse . A group of utilities supported the early development of the Madaras concept to the point that an experimental rotor was built on a fixed platform in Burlington , N.J. , in 1933 , but hard times and cheap fuel killed the project . It was resurrected three years ago by Dale Whitford of the University of Dayton , and about a year ago was accepted into DOE 's advanced-concepts program . Lift translator The lift translator PS , Feb. developed by Dr. Daniel Schneider , a physician based in Irving , Tex. , can be likened to a cyclogyro vertical-axis wind machine laid on its side . This idea can be adapted to use either wind or hydro power . Indeed , most of the DOE funding it now receives is to develop a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a series of aircraft-wing-like airfoils attached to an endless belt . The foils on one side of the belt are pushed up by the wind , while those on the opposite side are also contributing to energy production as they are pushed down by the wind . Because this machine can be actuated from a fixed position by winds coming from a wide range of directions , it needs no yaw control . It also is not limited to size as are wind machines with conventional rotor blades , and it can operate in a wide range of wind speeds . A 45-foot-high working model built at the University of Texas at Dallas proved the viability of the concept . It ran for nine months and generated up to 15 kilowatts of power . The question now is real-world economics .
