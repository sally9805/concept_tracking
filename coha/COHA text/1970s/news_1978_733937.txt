Almost every . one has got one , although some use it very seldom and others never at all . But Lynn has not had one for two years  --  except for a handful of doctors and nurses , no one has been able to see It . For Lynn has been hiding it , in shame and in fear , behind a mask she has refused to take off her face . LYNN WAS once a beauty . She had long dark hair that cascaded down her back . And lovely white skin . And green eyes that sparkled out at the world . She was a beautiful woman until one autumn night two years ago when she stopped by to see a friend . Her son , then nine years old , was sitting in the car outside while his mother ran her errand . But once at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She ran in to warn her friend and get him out in time , but she fell unconscious on the floor . Her friend was pulled out uninjured by firemen , who found him right away . But they did not find Lynn right away . They did not know she was there . ALTHOUGH HER son sat outside shrieking " My Mommy 's in there , my mommy 's in there , " they did not find Lynn until she herself had begun to burn . The long dark hair , tho lovely skin , the beautiful face were gone . She was critically burned from the waist up . Her face , her neck , her arms , her chest , her shoulders , ' and hands. ? all scarred . She lost all but three of her fingers . She vas in the hospital for months . There were many more months at the // Close-up With Anne Keegan ' 3110to From clam one Priceless present : His mother 's smile // Chicago Rehabilitation Institute , where she had to learn to do everything all over again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she would not came out of her room . She would not talk to other paHeats . She would mix with no one , but sat with her door closed , alone . And she would never , ever look in a mirror . " I JUST could n't face what I 'd become , " she says . " Because of what I looked like once , it was very hard . I was very bitter . ? " I 'd found that the friends I used to have did not come ' around after the accident . I found they had not taken me for what was on the inside but for what was on the outside ? beauty . Inside I was the same person . But they did not come around . I felt rejected . " If it had not been for my son , I do n't think I would have had the will to live . But I had him to live for .

The nurses saW to that  --  fussing over her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resented it , yelling at them and balking at their orders , because she was in pain and because she was afraid . , She was forced to wear a mask on her face to help the skingraft scars heal smoothly . " At first I could n't stand it , " she says . " It was torture , it hurt my face so much . But slowly I got used to it , and I knew it was for my own good . " " Then it got so I did n't want to take it , off . I did n't want people to see what was underneath it . I was hiding behind the mask because of what had happened to my face . No one could get me to take it off . " LYNN 'S SON has been in a boarding school since the fire , because Lynn is divorced and there is no one to care for him . " When I got to see him on holidays , he would say to me , ' Mommy , take off your mask . Please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you look nice and we 'll go out somewhere . ' But I never would . I just could n't . " I always mire the mask with him out in public , and people would stare at me and make remarks . The adults were crueler than the children . It would get my son terribly upset when people stared at me , and he would call them all ' Four eyes . ' ' " ONE LADY said to me just a few weeks ago , ' I thought Halloween was over , ' and that hurt me and made me even more afraid to take it off . " I thought if they do that to me with a mask on , what will they do when they see me without one ? " " I was afraid their remarks would hurt my son even more . Once , when someone made a remark , I said real quietly , ' I was n't always this ugly . ' " But on Thanksgiving he asked me again to take off the mask . That 's really what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since then that I have to face up to the fact that I 'm not the same and never will be . I have a different face . I ca n't hide ' forever . ? " IT IS A hard decision , and I 'd be telling you a lie if I told you I am not afraid . But I 'm going to do it for my son . " Tuesday Lynn went shopping with Dorothy Kubalanza , a head nurse at the Rehabilitation Institute  --  one who has befriended Lynn in the many months she has worked with her . They went off to do something Lynn has not dime for more than two years . They went to buy some makeup : It was Dorothy 's treat , for Lynn does not have the money to buy it . And for the first time , Lynn went out in public without her mask . A little timidly . A little fearful . But she went . THEY BOUGHT eye-liner and eye shadow , lipstick and lip gloss : A liquid base and rouge and an eye brow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lynn put it on . And then she took a look a the mirror ? a long look in the mirror . And she liked what she saw . Another nurse held up the long-used mask sitting crumpled on the desk . " What 'll I do with this ? " " Well , " said Lynn without hesitation , " I guess you 'll hive to throw it away . I wo n't need it anymore . " THURSDAY LYNN will be staying at a friend 's house when her boy , on his Christmas vacation , comes to see her . She is very excited . Oh yes , she will have a toy wrapped up in Christmas , paper . But she . will have something much more . She will be sitting there waiting for him , arms out , eyes glowing , her hair done , and with color in her cheeks . The mask will be gone . And for the first time in more than two years , her son will see it . Because for Christmas she is giving him her smile . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
