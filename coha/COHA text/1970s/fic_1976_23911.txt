LAST COURTESIES A story by Ella Leffland L ILLIAN , you 're too polite , " Vladimir kept telling her . She did not think so . Perhaps she was not one to return shoves in the bus line , but she did fire 41 censorious glares ; and , true , she never yelled at the paper boy who daily flung her Chronicle to a rain-soaked fate , but she did beckon him to her door and remind him of his responsibilities . If she was always the last to board the bus , if she continued to dry out the paper on the stove , that was the price she must pay for observing the minimal courtesy the world owed itself if it was not to go under . Civilized she was . Excessively polite , no . In any case , even if she had wanted to , she could not change at this stage of life . Nor had Aunt Bedelia ever changed in any manner . Not that she really compared herself to her phenomenal aunt , who , when she had died @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still a captivating woman ; no faded great beauty ( the family ran to horse faces ) , but elegant , serenely vivid . Any other old lady who dressed herself in long gowns circa 1910 would have appeared a mere oddity ; but under Bedelia 's antiquated hairdo sat a brain ; in her gnarled , almond-scented fingers lay direction . She spoke of Bach , of the Russian novelists , of her garden and the consolations of nature ; never of her arthritis , the fallen ranks of her friends , or the metamorphosis of the neighborhood , which now featured motorcycles roaring alongside tin cans and blackened banana peels . At rare moments a sigh escaped her lips , but who knew if it was for her crippled fingers she had been a consummate pianist ) or a repercussion from the street ? It was bad form , ungallant , to put too fine a point on life 's discomfitures . Since Bedelia 's death the flat was lonely ; lonely yet no longer private , since a supremely kinetic young woman , herself a music lover , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to , with thuds and acid rock resounding from above , Lillian drifted ( too often , she knew ) into the past , fingering its high points . The day , for instance , that Vladimir had entered their lives by way of the Steinway grand ( great gleaming relic of better times ) which he came to tune . He had burst in , dressed notin a customary suit but in garage mechanic 's overalls and rubber thong sandals , a short square man with the large disheveled head of a furious gnome , who embellished his labors with glorious run-throughs of Bach and Scarlatti , but whose speech , though a dark bog of Slavic intonations , was distinctly , undeniably obscene . Aunt Bedelia promptly invited him to dinner the following week . Lillian stood astonished , but reminded herself that her aunt was a sheltered soul unfamiliar with scabrous language , whereas she , Lillian , lived more in the great world , riding the bus every day to the Opera House , where she held the position of switchboard operator ( Italian and German required @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she inquired about Vladimir . Several people there knew of him . A White Russian , lie had fled to Prague with his parents in 1917 , then fled again twenty years later , eventually settling in San Francisco , where he quickly earned the reputation of an excellent craftsman and a violent crackpot . He abused clients who had no knowledge of their pianos ' intestines , and had once been taken to court by an acquaintance whom he had knocked down during a conversation about Wagner . Ile wrote scorching letters of general advice to the newspapers ; with arms like a windmill he confronted mothers who allowed their children to drop potato chips on the sidewalk ; he kept a bucket of accumulated urine to throw on dog-walkers who were unwary enough to linger with their squatting beasts beneath his window . He had been institutionalized several times . That night Lillian informed her aunt that Vladimir was brilliant but unsound . The old woman raised an eyebrow at this . " For instance , " Lillian pursued , " he is actually known to have struck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's voice was clear and melodious , with a faint ring of iron . " It was during a conversation about Wag- ner . Apparently he disapproves of Wagner . " , Her aunt gave a nod of endorsement . " The man has even had himself committed , aunt . Several times , when he felt he was getting out of hand . " The old woman pondered this . " It shows foresight , " she said at length , " and a sense of social responsibility . " Lillian was silent for a moment . Then she pointed out : He said unspeakable things here . " " They are mutually exclusive terms . " " Let us call them obscenities , then . You may not have caught them . " The old woman rose from her chair and arranged the long skirt of her dove-gray ensemble , " Lillian , one must know when to turn a deaf ear . " " I am apparently not in the know , " Lillian said dryly . " Perhaps it is an instinct . " And suddenly she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for she retained her own ancient teeth ) but completely beguiling , and added : " In any case , he is of my own generation , Lillian . That counts for a great deal . " " lie ca n't be more than sixty , aunt . " " It is close enough . Anyway , he is quite wrinkled . Also , he is a man of integrity . " " How can you possibly know that ? " " It is my instinct . " And gently touching her niece 's cheek , she said goodnight and went to her room , which peacefully overlooked the back garden , away from the street noises . Undressing in her own smaller room , Lillian reflected , not for the first time , that though it was Bedelia who had remained unwed  --  Lillian herself having been married and widowed during the war  --  it was she , Lillian , who felt more the old maid , who seemed more dated , in a stale , fusty way , with her tight 1950s hairdo , her plain wool suits and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practical life ... it was she who was trampled in the bus queue and who sat down to a hectic ? switchboard , who swept the increasingly filthy sidewalk and dealt with the sullen butcher and careless paper boy  --  or tried to ... it seemed she was a middlewoman , a hybrid , too worldly to partake of aunt 's immense calm , too seclusive to sharpen herself on the changing ways ... aunt had sealed herself off in a lofty , gracious world ; she lived for it , she would have died for it if it came to that ... but what could she , Lillian , die for ? ... she fit in nowhere , she thought , climbing into bed , and thirty years from now she would not have aged into the rare creature aunt was  --  last survivor of a fair , legendary breed , her own crimped hairdo as original as the Edwardian pouf , her boxy suits as awesome as the floor-sweeping gowns  --  no , she would just be a peculiar old leftover in a room somewhere . For aunt was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they did n't make that kind anymore ; they did n't make those eyes anymore , large , hooded , a deep glowing violet . It was a hue that had passed . . . . And she closed her own eyes , of candid , serviceable gray , said the Lord 's Prayer , and prepared to act as buffer between her elite relative and the foul-mouthed old refugee . A UNT BEDELIA PREPARED the dinner herself , taking great pains ; then she creaked into her wet garden with an umbrella and picked her finest blooms for a centerpiece ; and finally . over the knobbed , arthritic joint of her ring finger , she twisted a magnificent amethyst usually reserved for Christmas , Laster , and Bach 's birthday . These touches Lillian expected to be lost on their wild-eyed guest , but Vladimir kissed the festive hand with a cavalier click of his sandals , acknowledged the flowers with a noisy inhalation of his large , hairy nostrils , and ate his food with admirable if strained refinement . During coffee he capsized his cup , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Bavarian spas and Italian sea resorts to music theory , Turgenev , and God knew what else  --  Lillian could hardly follow  --  and then , urged by aunt , he jumped from the table , rolled up the sleeves of his overalls , and flung himself into Bach , while aunt , her fingers stiffly moving up and down on her knee , threw back her head and entered some region of flawless joy . At eleven o'clock Vladimir wrestled into his red lumber jacket , expressed his delight with the evening , and slapped down the steps to his infirm 193B Buick . Not one vulgar word had escaped his lips . Nor in the seven following years of his friendship with Bedelia was this precedent ever broken . Even the night when some drunk sent an empty pint of muscatel crashing through the window , Vladimir 's respect for his hostess was so great that all scurrility was plucked from his wrath . However , when he and Lillian happened to he alone together he slipped right back into the belching , offensive mannerisms for which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aunt , who cherished the idea that he was very fond of Lillian . " You know how he detests opera , " the old lady would assure her , " and yet he has never alluded to the fact that you work at the Opera House and hold the form in esteem . " " A magnanimous gesture , " Lillian said , smiling . " For Vladimir , yes . " And after a moment 's thought , Lillian had to agree . Her aunt apparently understood Vladimir perfectly , and he her . She wondered if this insight was due to their shared social origins , their bond of elevated interests , or their more baroque twinhood of eccentricity . Whatever it was , the couple thrived , sometimes sitting up till midnight with their sherry and sheet music , sometimes , when the Buick was well , motoring ( Bedelia 's term ) into the countryside and then winding homeward along the darkening sea , in a union of perfect silence , as the old lady put it . Bedelia died suddenly , with aplomb , under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phonograph ; the chorus had just scaled the great peak before its heart-bursting cascade into the finale ; aunt threw her head back to savor the moment , and was gone . The next morning Lillian called Vladimir . He shrieked , he wept , he banged the receiver on the table ; and for ten days , helpless and broken , be spent every evening at the home of his departed love while Lillian , herself desolated , tried to soothe him . She felt certain he would never regain the strength to insult his clients again , much less strike anyone to the ground , but gradually he mended , and the coarseness , the irascibility flooded back , much worse than in the past . For Bedelia 's sake  --  of that Lillian was sure  --  he forced himself to take an interest in her welfare , which he would express in eruptions of advice whenever he telephoned . " You want to lead a decent life , Lillian , you give them hell ! They sell you a bad cut of meat , throw it in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stink ! You 're too soft ! Give them the finger , Lillian ! " " Yes , of course , " she would murmur . " For your aunt I was a gentleman , but now she 's gone , who appreciates ? A gentleman is a fool , a gentleman 's balls are cut off ! I know how to lake care of myself , I am in an armored tank ! And you should be too . Or find a protector . Get married ! " " Pardon ? " she asked . " Marry ! " " I have no desire to marry , Vladimir . " " Desire ! Desire ! It 's a world for your desires ? Think of your scalp ! You need a protector , now Bedelia 's gone ! " " Aunt was not my protector , " she said patiently . " Of course she was ! And mine too ! " Lillian shifted her weight from one foot to the other and hoped he would soon run down . " You want to get off the phone , do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get the shit off the phone , I 'm busy ! Do n't be a doormat ! Practice on me or you 'll come to grief ! What about that sow upstairs , have you given her hell yet ? No , no , of course not ! Jesus bleeding Christ , I give up ! " And he slammed the receiver down . ILLIAN HAD IN FACT complained . Allowing her new neighbor time to settle in , she had at first endured through apparently rugless floorboards the girl 's music , her door slams , her crashing footfall which was a strange combination of scurry and thud , her deep hollow brays of laughter and shrieks of " You 're kidding ! " and " Fantastic ! " ? all this usually accompanied by a masculine voice and tread ( varying from night to night , Lillian could not help but notice ) until finally , in the small hours , directly above Bedelia 's room , where Lillian now slept , ears stuffed with cotton , the night was crowned by a wild creaking of bedsprings and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , chancing to meet her tormentor on the front steps ( she was not the Amazon her noise indicated , but a small , thin creature nervously chewing gum with staccato snaps ) , Lillian decided to speak ; but before she could , the girl cried : " Hi ! I 'm Jody  --  from upstairs ? " with a quick , radiant smile that heartened the older woman in a way that the hair and hemline did not . Clad in a tiny , childish dress that barely reached her hip sockets , she might have been a prematurely worn twenty or an adolescent thirty ? dark circles hung beneath the eyes and a deep line was etched between them , but the mouth was babyish , sweet , and the cheeks a glowing pink against the unfortunate mane of brassy hair , dark along its uneven part . Having responded with her own name ( the formal first and last ) Lillian paused a courteous moment , then began : " I 'm glad to have this opportunity of meeting you ; I 've lived in this flat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes opposite , heavily outlined with blue pencil , were already wandering under this gratuitous information . Brevity was clearly the password . " The point is " ? restoring attention " I would appreciate it if you turned down your music after ten P.m . There is a ruling . " " It bugs you ? " the girl asked , beginning to dig turbulently through a fringed bag , her gum snaps accelerating with the search . " Well , it 's an old building , and of course if you do n't have carpets ... " She waited to be corroborated in this assumption , but now the girl pulled out her house key with fingers whose nails , bitten to the quick , were painted jet black . Fascinated , Lillian tried not to stare . " Not to worry , " the girl assured her with the brief , brilliant smile , plunging the key into the door and bounding inside , " I 'll cool it . " " There 's something else , I 'm afraid . When that door is slammed " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phone was ringing down from the top of the stairs . " I dig , I dig . Look , hon , my phone 's ringing . " And closing the door softly , she thundered up the stairs . After that the phonograph was lowered a little before midnight , but nothing else was changed . Lillian finally called the landlord , a paunchy , sweating man whom she rarely saw , and though she subsequently observed him disappearing into his unruly tenant 's flat several evenings a week , the visits were apparently useless . And every time she met the girl , she was greeted with an insufferable " Hi ! Have a nice day ! " Unfortunately , Lillian had shared some of her vexation with Vladimir , and whenever he dropped by  --  less to see her , she knew , than to replenish his memories of Bedelia  --  his wrath grew terrible under the commotion . On his last visit his behavior had frightened her . " Shut up ! " he had screamed , shaking his fist at the ceiling . " Shut up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  this language , just because Bedelia 's not here . " " Ah , Bedelia , Bedelia , " he groaned . " She would n't have tolerated it . " " She would n't have tolerated that ! Hear the laugh  --  lice haw , lice haw ! Braying ass ! Bedelia would have pulverized her with a glance ! None of this farting around you go in for ! " His large head had suffused with red , his hands were shaking at his sides . " Your aunt was a genius at judging people they should have lined up the whole fucking rotten city for her to judge ! " " It seems to me that you have always appointed yourself as judge , " Lillian said , forcing a smile . " Yah , but Vladimir is demented , you do n't forget ? He has it down in black and white ! Ah , you think I 'm unique , Lillian , but I am one of the many ! I am in the swim ! " He came over to her side and put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hers . " You read yesterday about the girl they found in an alley not far from here , cut to small bits ? Slash ! Rip ! Finito ! And you ask why ? Because the world , it is demented ! A murder of such blood not even in the headlines and you ask why ? Because it is commonplace ! Who walks safe on his own street ? It is why you need a husband ! " Lillian dropped her eyes , wondering for an embarrassed moment if Vladimir of all people could possibly be hinting at a marital alliance . Suddenly silent , he pulled a wadded handkerchief from his pocket with trembling fingers and wiped his brow . He flicked her asuspicious glance . " Do n't look so coy . I 'm not in the running . I loathe women  --  sticky ! Full of rubbishy talk ! " And once more he threw his head back and began bellowing obscenities at the ceiling . " It 's too much , Vladimir  --  please ! not yourself ! " " I am myself ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tired , I have a splitting headache ? " " You want me to go ! Be rude , good ! I have better things to do anyway ! " And his face still aflame , he struggled into his lumber jacket and flung out the door . T HAT NIGHT HER SLEEP was not only disturbed by the noise , but by her worry over the violence of Vladimir 's emotions . At work the next day she reluctantly inquired about her friend , whose antics were-usually circulated around the staff but seldom reached her cubicle . For the first time in years , she learned , the weird little Russian had gone right over the edge , flapping newspapers in strangers ' faces and ranting about the end of civilization ; storming out on tuning jobs and leaving his tools behind , then furiously accusing his clients of stealing them . The opinion was that if he did not commit himself soon , someone else would do it for him . On the clamorous bus home that night , shoved as usual into the rear , Lillian felt an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear , well-modulated voice that had always set the world to rights . But she opened her door on silence . She removed her raincoat arid sat down in the living room with the damp newspaper . People at work told her she should buy a television set  --  such a good companion when you lived alone ? but she hat ' too long scorned that philistine invention to change now . For that matter , she seldom turned on the radio , and even the new spapei ? she ran her eyes over the soggy turmoi of the front page  --  even the newspaper dis tressed her . Vladimir was extreme , but he wa : right : everything was coming apart . Sitting there , she thought she could hear the world ' : madness its rudeness , its litter , its raur ders  --  beat against the house with the rain And suddenly she closed her eyes under al intolerable longing for the past : for an peaceful years she had spent in these room with Bedelia ; and before that , for the face o her young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days .. - odd , but it nev er seemed to rain in her youth , the greet campus filled the air with dizzying sweetness she remembered running across the lawns for no reason but that she was twenty and the sun would shine forever ... . She gave way to two large tears . Shaken , yet somehow consoled , and at the same time ashamed of her self-indulgence , she went into the kitchen to make dinner . But as she cooked her chop she knew that even this small measure of comfort would be destroyed as soon as her neighbor came banging through the door . Already her neck was tightening against the sound . But there was no noise at all that night , not until one A.m. when the steady ring of the telephone pulled her groggily from bed . " Listen , you 'll kill me  --  it 's Jody , I 'm across the bay , and I just flashed on maybe I left the stove burners going . " " Who ? " Lillian said , rubbing her eyes , " Jody ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phone book , why ? Listen , the whole dump could catch fire , be a doll and check it out ? I he back door 's unlocked . " Lillian felt a strange little rush of gratitude  --  that her name , given to such seemingly indifferent ears on the steps that day , had been remembered . Then the feeling was replaced by anger ; but before she could speak , the girl said , " Listen , hon , thanks a million , " and hung up . Clutching her raincoat around her shoulders , beaming a flashlight before her , Lillian nervously climbed the dark back stairs to her neighbor 's door and - let herself into the kitchen . Turning on the light , she stood aghast at what she saw : not flames licking the wall , for the burners were off , but grimed linoleum , spilled garbage , a sink of stagnant water . On the puddled table , decorated with a jar of blackened , long-dead daisies , sat a greasy portable television set and a pile of dirty laundry in a litter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the congealed remains of spare ribs . Hesitating , ashamed of her snoopiness , she peered down at the pieces of paper : hills from department stores , including Saks and Magnin 's ; scattered food stamps ; handwritten notes on hinder paper , one of which read " Jamie hony theres a piza in the frezzer I love U " ? then several big hearts " Jody . " A long brown bug  --  a cockroach ? ? was crawling across the note , and now she noticed another one climbing over a spare rib . As she stood cringing , she heard rain blowing through an open window somewhere , lashing a shade into frenzies . Going to the bedroom door , which stood ajar , she beamed her flashlight in and switched on the light . Under the window a large puddle was forming on the floor , which was rugless as she had suspected , though half carpeted by strewn clothes . The room was furnished only with a bed whose convulsed , mummy-brown sheets put her in mind of a pesthouse , and a deluxe television @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was well stocked , and , having shut the window , she ran her eyes over the spines , curious . Many were cheap paperback thrillers , but there was an abundance of great authors : Dostoevsky , Dickens , Balzac , Melville . It was odd , she puzzled , that the girl had this taste in literature , yet could not spell the simplest word and had never heard of a comma . As she turned away , her eardrums were shattered by her own scream . A man stood in the doorway . A BOY , ACTUALLY , she realized through her fright ; one of Jody 's more outstanding visitors , always dressed in one of those Mexican shawl affairs and a battered derby hat , from under which butter-yellow locks flowed in profusion , everything at the moment dripping with rain . More embarrassed now than frightened  --  she had never screamed in her life , or stood before a stranger in her nightgown , and neither had Bedelia  --  she began pulsating with dignity . " I did n't hear anyone come up the stairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , man , " he said with a cavernous yawn , " Where 's Jody ? Who 're you ? " She explained her presence , pulling the raincoat more firmly together across her bosom , but unable to do anything about the expanse of flowered flannel below . " Jody , she 'd forget her ass if it was n't screwed on , " the boy said with a second yawn . His eyes were watery and red , and his nose ran . " If you 'll excuse me , " she said , going past him . He followed her back into the kitchen and suddenly , with a hostlike warmth that greatly surprised her , he asked , " You want some coffee ? " She declined , saying that she must be go-Mg . At this he heaved a deep , disappointed sigh , which again surprised her , and sank like an invalid into a chair . He was a slight youth with neat little features crowded into the center of his face , giving him , despite his woebegone expression , a pert , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been called a " pretty boy . " He would not have been her type at all she had always preferred the lean profile . " My name 's Jamie , " he announced suddenly , with a childlike spontaneity beneath the film of languor ; and he proffered his hand . Gingerly , she shook the cold small fingers . " Hey , really , " he entreated , " Stay and rap awhile . " " Rap ? " - Talk , man . Talk to me . " And he looked , all at once , so lonely , so forlorn , that even though she was very tired , she felt she must stay a moment longer . Pulling out a chair , she took a temporary , edge-of-the-seat position across the hideous table from him . He seemed to be gathering his thoughts together . " So what 's your bag ? " he asked . She looked at him hopelessly . " My bag ? " " You a housewife ? You work ? " " Oh  --  yes , I work , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her will to have inspired it . " What 's your name ? " he asked . lle was speaking to her as a contemporary ; and again , she was both pleased by this and offended by his lack of deference . " Lillian ... Cronin , " she said uncertainly . " I 'm Jamie , " he sighed . " So you mentioned . " And she thought  --  Jamie , Jody , the kinds of names you would give pet rabbits . Where were the solid , straightforward names of yesteryear  --  the Georges and Harolds , the Dorothy ; and Margarets ? - What did she have to say to a Jamie in a Mexican shawl and threadbare derby who was now scratching himself all over with little fidgety movements ? But she said , breaking the long silence , which he seemed not to notice : " And what is your bag , if I may ask ? " He took several moments to answer . " I do n't know , man . . . I 'm a student of human nature . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not me , man , that 's Jody 's scene . . . into yoga , alpha waves , the whole bit . . . even studies macrame and world lit at jay cee . " " Indeed ? How interesting . I noticed her books . " " She 's a towering intellect . " He yawned , his eyes glassy with fatigue . He was scratching himself more slowly now . " And does she work , as well ? " Lillian asked , once more ashamed of her nosiness . " Work ? " he smiled . " Maybe you could call it that . . . " I3ut his attention was drifting away like smoke . Fumbling with a bread knife , he picked it up and languidly , distantly , speared a cockroach with the point . Then , with the side of the knife , he slowly , methodically , squashed the other one . Averting her eyes from the massacre , Lillian leaned forward . " / do n't mean to soundfamiliar , but you seem a quiet person . Do you think you might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I 've spoken to the landlord , but ? " She saw the hoy smile again , an odd , rueful smile that made her feel , for some reason , much younger than be . " You see ? " she continued , but he was fading from her presence , slowly mashing his bugs to pulp and now dropping the knife to reach over and click on the food-spattered television set . Slouched , his eyes bored by what the screen offered , he nevertheless began following an old movie . The conversation appeared to be over . Lillian rose . She was not accustomed , nor would Bedelia have been , to a chat ending without some mutual amenity . She felt awkward , dismissed . With a cool nod she left bhn and descended the splashing stairs to her own flat . Such a contrast the youth was of warmth and rudeness . . and Jody , an illiterate studying Dostoevsky at college . . . food stamps lying hugger-mugger with bills from Saks . . . it was impossible to bring it all into focus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life had become . . . everything mixed up . . . a generation of fragments . . . . Climbing heavily back into bed , she wondered what Bedelia would have thought of Jody and Jamie . And she remembered how unkempt and disconcerting Vladimir had been , yet how her aunt had quickly penetrated to the valuable core while she , Lillian , fussed on about his bad language . No doubt Bedelia would have been scandalized by the filth upstairs , but she would not have been so narrow-souled as to find fault with spelling mistakes , first names , taste in clothing . . . . Bedelia might not have pulverized Jody with a glance , as Vladimir suggested , but instead seen some delicate tragedy in the worn cherubic features , or been charmed by the girl 's invincible buoyancy . . . it was hard to tell with Bedelia , which facet she might consider the significant one ... she often surprised you . . . it had to do with largeness of spirit . . Whereas she , Lillian , had always to guard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hold high the torch of goodwill . . . too pompous a simile , of course , but she knew clearly and deeply what she meant . . so let Vladimir rave on at her for refusing to shrink into a knot of hostility ; what was Vladimir . after all ? Insane . Her eyes opened in the dark as she faced what she had tried to avoid all day : that Vladimir had been wrenched off the tracks by Bedelia 's death , and that this time he felt no need to commit himself . Without question it was Lillian 's duty to enlighten him . But she winced at the thought . . . such a terrible thing to have to tell someone . . . if only she could turn to Bedelia ... how sorely she missed her . . . how sorely she missed George 's lean young face under his Army cap . . . youth . . . sunlight . . . outside the rain still fell . . . she had only herself , and the dark , unending rain .. . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if she had only herself , she had better be decent company . And closing her eyes she tried to sleep . But not until a gray watery dawn was breaking did she drop off . T HE OPERA HOUSE TELEPHONED at three minutes past nine . Leaden , taut-nerved , sourly questioning the rewards of her long , exquisite punctuality , she pulled on her clothes , and , with burning eyes and empty stomach , hurried out of the house . At work , though the board was busy , the hours moved with monumental torpor . She felt increasingly unlike herself , hotly brimming over with impatience for all this switchboard blather : calls from New York , Milan ; Sutherland with her sore throat , Pavarotti with his tight schedule  --  did they really think that , if another Rigoletto were never given , anyone would notice ? She felt an urge to slur this fact into the headphone , as befitted a truant traipsing in at a quarter to ten , as befitted someone with minimally combed hair and crooked seams and , even worse , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day before . As if a slatternly , cynical Lillian whom she did n't recognize had squeezed slyly into prominence , a Lillian who half-considered walking out on the whole tiresome business and indulging in a lavish two-hour lunch downtown  --  let someone else serve , let someone else be polite . Sandwiched into the bus aisle that night , she almost smacked an old gentleman who crunched her right instep under his groping heel ; and as she creaked into the house with her wet newspaper and saw that a motorcyclist had been picked off on the freeway by a sniper , she had to fight down a lip curl of satisfaction . Then , reflectively , still in her raincoat , she walked to the end of the hall where an oval mirror hung , and studied her face . It was haggard , flinty , stripped of faith , scraped down to the cold , atavistic bones of retaliation . She had almost walked off her job , almost struck an old man , almost smiled at murder . A feeling of panic shot through her ; what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sleepless night ? And shesank the terrible face into her hands ; but a ray of rational thought lifted it again . " Almost . " Never mind the querulous inner tremble , at each decisive moment her principles had stood fast . Was n't a person entitled to an occasional frt of petulance ? There is such a thing as perspective , she told herself , and in the meantime a great lust for steam and soap had spread through her . She would scrub out the day in a hot bath and in perfect silence , for apparently Jody had not yet returned from across the bay . God willing , the creature would remain away a week . Afterward , boiled pink , wrapped in her quilted robe , she felt restored to grace . A fine appetite raced through her , along with visions of a tuna casserole which she hurried into the kitchen to prepare , hurrying out again at the summons of the telephone . It was Vladimir , very excited , wanting to drop by . Her first response was one of blushing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second she articulated : she was bone-tired , she was going to bed right after dinner . But even as she spoke she heard the remorseless door slam of Jody 's return , and a violent spasm twisted her features . " Please  --  next week , " she told Vladimir and hung up , clutching her head as tears of rage and exhaustion burst from her eyes . Weeping , she made a tuna sandwich , chewed it without heart , and sank onto her unmade bed . The next morning , still exhausted , she made an emergency appointment with her doctor , and came home that night with a bottle of sleeping pills . By the end of the week she was sick with artificial sleep , there was an ugly rubber taste in her mouth , her eye sockets felt caked with rust . And it was not only the noise and pills that plagued her : a second neighborhood woman had been slashed to death by the rain man ( the newspapers , in their cozy fashion , had thus baptized the slayer ) . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying the Lord 's Prayer ; her medicinal sleep crackled with surreal visions ; at the sullen butcher 's her eyes were morbidly drawn to the meat cleaver ; and at work not only had she upset coffee all over her lap , but she disconnected Rudolf Bing himself in the middle of a sentence . And never any respite from above . She had called the landlord again , without audible results , and informed the Board of Health about the cockroaches ; their reply was that they had no jurisdiction over cockroaches . She had stuck several notes under Judy 's door pleading with her to quiet down , and had stopped her twice on the steps , re-ceiving the first time some capricious remark , and the second a sigh of " Christ , Lilly , I 'm trying . What &you.; want ? " Lilly ! The gall !

So youth could crumble , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours were boomeranging , and would soon smash her down in a heap of deathlike stillness ( would that Lillian could implement this vision ) . Or perhaps it was her affair with Jamie that was running her ragged . Ah , the costly trauma of love ! Jealousy , misunderstanding  --  so damaging to the poor nervous system ! Or so she had heard . . . she and George had been blessed with rapport . . . but try not to dwell on the past . . yes , possibly it was Jamie who was lining the girl 's face . . . Lillian had seen him a few times since their first meeting , once on the steps  --  he smiled , was pleasant , remembered her , but had not remembered to zip his fly , and she had hurried on , embarrassed  --  and twice in the back garden , where on the less drenching days she tended Bedelia 's flowers , but without her aunt 's emerald-green thumb . . . a rare sunny afternoon , she had been breaking off geraniums ; Jody and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their thin bodies white , somehow poignant in their delicacy ... she felt like a great stuffed mattress in her sleeveless dress , soiled hands masculine with age , a stevedore 's drop of sweat hanging from her nose . . . could they imagine her once young and tender on her own bed of love ? or now , with a man friend ? As if everything closed down at fifty-seven , like a bankrupt hotel ! ? tearing off the head of a geranium brash presumption of youth ! But she saw that they were n't even aware of her , no , they were kissing and rolling about ... in Bedelia 's garden ! " Here , what are you doing ! " she cried , but in the space of a moment a hostile little flurry had taken place , and now they broke away and lay separately in charged silence , still taking no notice of her as she stood there , heart thumping , fist clenched . She might have been air . Suddenly , sick from the heat , she had plodded inside . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this afternoon when , arriving home from work and changing into a fresh dress for Vladimir 's visit , she happened to glance out her bedroom window .

It was her raw nerves , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . even as she stood there , her persecutor was trying on clothes , dropping shoes , pounding from closet to mirror ( for Lillian could by now divine the activity behind each noise ) while simultaneously braying into the telephone receiver stuck between chin and shoulder , and sketchily attending the deluxe television set , which blared a hysterical melodrama . . . Outside , the youth sank onto a tree stump , from which he cast the upstairs window a long bleak look . . . they must have had a lovers ' quarrel , and the girl had shut him out ; now he brooded in the rain , an exile ; or rather a kicked puppy , shivering and staring up with ponderous woe . . . then , eyes dropping , he caught sight of Lillian , and a broad , sunny , candid smile flashed from the dismal countenance . . odd , jarring , she thought , giving a polite nod and dropping the curtain , especially after his rude imperviousness that hot day on the grass . . . a generation of fragments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she never objected to a smile ( with the exception of Jody 's grimace ) . . . and walking down the hall away from the noise , she was stopped woodenly by the sound of the girl 's doorbell . It was one of the gentlemen callers , who tore up the stairs booming felicitations which were returned with the inevitable shrieks , this commingled din moving into the front room and turning Lillian around in her tracks . With the door closed , the kitchen was comparatively bearable , and it was time to eat anyway . She bought television dinners now , lacking the vigor to cook . She had lost seven pounds , but was not growing svelte , only drawn . Even to turn on the waiting oven was a chore . But slowly she got herself into motion , and at length , pouring out a glass of burgundy to brace herself for Vladimir 's visit , she sat down to the steaming , neatly sectioned pap . Afterward , dutifully washing her glass and fork in the sink , she glanced out the window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garden was dark and she could not be sure , but she thought she saw the youth still sitting on the stump . It was beyond her , why anyone would sit still in a downpour . . . but everything was beyond her , insurmountable . . . and soon Vladimir would arrive . . the thought was more than she could bear , but she could not defer his visit again , it would be too rude . . . H E BURST IN like a cannonball , tear-ing off his wet lumber jacket , an acrid smell of sweat blooming from his armpits ; his jaws were stubbled with white , great bushes sprouted from his nostrils . " You look terrible ! " he roared . Even though she had at the last moment rubbed lipstick into her pallid cheeks . She gave a deflated nod and gestured toward the relatively quiet kitchen , but he wanted the Bedelia-redolent front room , where he rushed over to the Steinway and lovingly dashed off an arpeggio , only to stagger back with his finger knifed up at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Please ? " she said raggedly . " No advice , I beg of you . " " No advice ? Into your grave they 'll drive you , Lillian ! " And she watched his finger drop , compassionately it seemed , to point at her slumped bosom with its heart heating so wearily inside . It was a small hand , yet blunt , virile , its back covered with coarse dark hair . . . what if it reached farther , touched her ? .. . But spittle already flying , Vladimir was plunging into a maelstrom of words , obviously saved up for a week . " I wanted to come sooner , why did n't you let me ? Look at you , a wreck ! Vladimir knew a second one would be cut  --  he smells blood on the wind ! He wants to come and pound on your door , to be with you , but no , he respects your wish for privacy , so he sits every night out front in his auto , watching ! " Here he broke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard the swollen , rusty lids of her eyes , accepted the immense duty of guiding him to confinement . " And every night , " he roared on , " While Vladimir sits , Bedelia plays Komm , Jesu , Komm , ' it floats into the street , it is beautiful , beautiful ? " " Ah , Vladimir , " broke pityingly from her lips . Silence . With a clap of restored lucidity his fist struck his forehead . It remained tightly glued there for some time . When it fell away he seemed quite composed . " I have always regretted , " he said crisply , " That you resemble the wrong side of your family . All you have of Bedelia is a most vague hint of her cheekbones . " Which he was scrutinizing with his small glittering eyes . Again , nervously , she sensed that he would touch her ; but instead , a look of revulsion passed over his features as he stared first at one cheek , then the other . " You 've got fucking gunk on ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tone . " I 'm not used to being stared at , Vladimir . " " Hall , I should think not , " he snapped abstractedly , eyes still riveted . Beast ! Vile wretch ! But at once she was shamed by her viciousness . From where inside her did it come ? And site remembered that terrible day at work when a malign and foreign Lillian had pressed into ascendancy , almost as frightening a character change as the one she was seeing before her 110W , for Vladimir 's peering eyes seemed actually black with hatred . " Stinking whore-rouge , " he breathed ; then with real pain , he cried : " Have you no thought for Bedelia ? You have the blessing of her cheekbones ! Respect them ! Do n't drag them through the gutter ! My God , Lillian ! My God ! " She said nothing . It seemed the only thing to do . But now he burst forth again , cheerfully , rubbing his hands together . " Listen to Vladimir . You want a husband , forget the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A good bearing straightenthe shoulders  --  and cooking talent . Not like Bedelia 's , but not bad . Now , Vladimir has been looking around for you ? " " Vladimir , " she said through her teeth . " ? and he has found a strong , healthy widower of fifty-two years , a great enjoyer of the opera . He has been advised of your virtues ? " " Vladimir ! " " Of course you understand Vladimir himself is out , Vladimir is a monolith ? " A particularly loud thump shuddered the ceiling , and he jumped back yelling , " Shove it , you swine ! Lice ! " " Vladimir , I do not want a man ! " Lillian snapped . " Not so ! I sense sex boiling around in you ! " Her lips parted ; blood rushed into her cheeks to darken the artificial blush . For certain , with that short , potent word , sex , his hands would leap on her . " But you look a thousand years old , " he went on , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must get rid of this madhouse upstairs ! What have you done so far  --  not even told the land-lord ! " " I have ! " she cried ; and suddenly the thought of confiding in someone loosened a stinging flood of tears from her eyes , and she sank into a chair . " He has come to speak to her . . . time and time again . .. he seems always to be there . . . but nothing changes .... " " Ah , so , " said Vladimir , pulling out his gray handkerchief and handing it to her . " The sow screws him . " 1 She grimaced both at the words and the reprehensible cloth , with which she nevertheless dabbed her eyes . " I do n't believe that , " she said nasally . " Why not ? She 's a prostitute . Only to look at her . " " You 've seen her ? " she asked , slowly raising her eyes . But of course , if he sat outside in his car every night .. . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revulsion hardening his eyes . " I have seen much . Even a bat-man with the face of a sorrowful kewpie doll . He pines this minute on the front steps . " " That 's her boyfriend , " Lillian murmured , increasingly chilled by the thought of Vladimir sitting outside all night , spying . " Boyfriend ! A hundred boyfriends she has , each with a roll of bills in his pocket ! " Tensely , she smoothed the hair at her temples . " Forgive me , Vladimir , " she said gently , " But you exaggerate . You exaggerate everything , I 'm afraid . I must point this out to you , because I think it does you no good . I really ? " " Do n't change the subject ! We 're talking about her , upstairs ! " She was silent for a moment . " The girl is ? too free , I suppose , in our eyes . But I 'm certain that she is n't what you call her . " " And how do you come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lifted her hands in explanation , but they hung helplessly suspended . " Well , " she said at last , " I know she reads Dostoevsky . she takes courses . . . and she cares for that boy in the cape , even if they do have their quarrels . . . and there 's a quality of anguish in her face . . . " " Anguish ! 1 call it the knocked-out look of a female cretin who uses her ass every night to pay the rent . And that pea-brain boyfriend outside , in his secondhand ghoul costume to show how interesting he is ! Probably he pops pills and lives off his washerwoman mother , if he has n't slit her throat in a fit of irritation ! It 's the type , Lillian ! Weak , no vision , no guts ! The sewers are vomiting them up by the thousands to mix with us ! They surround us ! Slop ! Shit ! Chaos ! Listen to that up there ! Hee-haw ! Call that anguish ? Even pleasure ? No , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  like a wheel spun into motion and never stopped again ! It 's madness ! The madness of our times ! " But as he whipped himself on , Lillian felt herself growing diametrically- clear and calm , as if the outburst were guiding her blurred character back into focus . When he stopped , she said firmly , " Yes , 1 understand what you mean about the wheel spinning . There is something pointless about them , something pitiful . But they 're not from a sewer . They 're people , Vladimir , human beings like ourselves ... " " Ah , blanket democracy ! What else would you practice but that piss-fart abomination ? " " I practice what Bedelia herself practiced , " she replied tartly . " Ah , " he sighed , " The difference between instinct and application . Between a state of grace and a condition of effort . Dear friend Lillian , tolerance is dangerous without insight . And the last generation with insight has passed , with the things it understood . Like the last generation of cobblers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a dead art  --  the world has no use for it ! The world will trample you down ! Do n't think of the past , think of your scalp ! " " No , " she stated , rising and swaying with the lightheadedness that so frequently visited her now . " To live each moment as if you were in danger  --  it 's demeaning . I will not creep around snarling like some four-legged beast . I am a civilized human being . Your attitude shows a lack of proportion , Vladimir ; 1 feel that you really ? " A flash of sinewy hands ; her wrists were seized and crushed together with a stab of pain through whose shock she felt a marginal heat of embarrassment , a tingling dismay of abrupt intimacy . Then the very center of her skull was pierced by his shriek . " You are in danger ! Ca n't you see ! " and he thrust his face at hers , disclosing the red veins of his eyes , hits of sleep matted in the lashes , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abyss and is seeing it again . Her heart gave the chop of an axe ; with a wail she strained back . His fixed look broke ; his eyes grew flaring , kinetic . " One minute the blood is nice and cozy in its veins  --  the next , slice ! and slice ! and slice ! Red fountains go up  --  a festival ! Worthy of Handel ! Oh marvelous , marvelous ! The rain man ? " Here he broke off to renew his grip as she struggled frantically to pull away . " The rain man , he 's in ecstasies ! Such founts and spouts , such excitement ! Then at last it 's all played out , nothing but puddles , and off he trots , he 's big success ! And it 's big city many many fountains to be had , all red as  --  as  --  red as ? " Her laboring wrists were flung aside ; his hands slammed against her face and pressed fiercely into the cheeks . " Vladimir ! " she screamed , " It 's Lillian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stepped back and stood immobile . Then a self-admonishing hand rose shakily to his face , which had gone the color of pewter . After a long moment he turned and walked out of the house . S HE BLUNDERED TO THE DOOR and locked it behind him , then ran heavily back into the front room where she came to a blank stop , both hands pressed to her chest . Hearing the sound of an engine starting , she wheeled around to the window and pinched back the edge of the shade . Through the rain she saw the big square car jerk and shudder , while its motor rose to a crescendo of whines and abruptly stopped . Vladimir climbed out and started back across the pavement . Her brain finally clicked : the telephone , the police . With long strides she gained the hall where the telephone stood , and where she now heard the anticipated knock  --  but mild , rueful , a diminished sound that soon fell away . She moved on haltingly ; she would call the police , yes  --  or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone , she must talk to someone , and suddenly she stumbled with a cry : it was Vladimir 's lumber jacket she had tripped over , still lying on the floor where he had dropped it , his wallet sticking out from the pocket . Outside , the Buick began coughing once more , then it fell silent . A few moments later the shallow , timid knock began again . Without his wallet he could not call a garage , a taxi . It was a fifteen-block walk to his house in the rain . If only she could feel Bedelia 's presence beside her , look to the expression in the intelligent eyes . Gradually , concentrating on those eyes , she felt an unclenching inside her . She gazed at the door . Behind it Vladimir was Vladimir still . He had spoken with horrifying morbidity , and even hurt her wrists and face , but lie was not the rain man . Bedelia would have seen such seeds . He had been trying to warn her tonight of the world 's dangers , and in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her fingertip she touched the rouged and aching ovalof her cheek . Strange , tortured soul who had stationed himself out in the cold , night after night , to keep her from harm . Bending down , she gathered up the rough , homely jacket ; but the knocking had stopped . She went back into the front room and again tweaked aside the shade . He was going away , a small decelerated figure , already drenched . Now he turned the corner and was lost from sight . Depleted , she leaned against the wall . It might have been a long while that she stood there , that the noise from above masked the sound , but by degrees she became aware of knocking . He must have turned around in the deluge and was now , with what small hope , tapping on the door again . She hesitated , once more summoning the fine violet eyes , the tall brow under its archaic coiffure , which dipped in an affirmative nod . The jacket under her arm , Lillian went into the hall , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was not Vladimir who stood there , but Jamie , as wet as if he had crawled from the ocean , his long curls limply clinging to the foolish cape , his neat little features stamped with despair , yet warmed , saved , by the light of greeting in his eyes . Weary , unequal to any visit , she shook her head . " Jody ? " she thought she heard him say , or more likely it was something else  --  the rain muffled his voice ; though she caught an eerie , unnatural tone that she now sensed was reflected in the luminous stare . With a sudden feeling of panic she started to slam the door in his face . But she braked herself , knowing that she was overwrought ; it was unseemly to use such brusqueness on this lost creature because of her jangled nerves . So she paused for one haggard , courteous moment to say , " I 'm sorry , Jamie , it 's late ? some other time . " And in that moment the shrouded figure crouched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She felt a huge but painless blow , followed by a dullness , a stillness deep inside her , and staggering back as he kicked the door shut behind them , she clung to the jamb of the front-room entrance and slowly sank to her knees . She dimly comprehended the wet cloak brushing her side , but it was the room that held her attention , that filled her whole being . It had grown immense , lofty , and was suffused with violet , overwhelmingly beautiful . But even as she watched , it underwent a rapid wasting , paled to the faint , dead-leaf hue of an old tintype ; and now it vanished behind a sheet of black as the knife was wrenched from her body .
