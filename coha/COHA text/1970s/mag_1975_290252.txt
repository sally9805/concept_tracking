In Brazil , he was considered so valuable that the government once forbade him to play for a foreign team . In Africa , he was so imposing a legend that a cease-fire was called during the Biafran war so that both sides could watch him perform . But in the U.S. , where the game of soccer has been played more for kicks than major-league cash , he is something of an anomaly . So Edson Arantes do Nascimento , known almost everywhere as Pel , made his debut last week for the New York Cosmos , seeking by his message to establish American credibility for his medium . <P> By all reasonable standards , his performance was a triumph . With his team down 2-0 to the Dallas Tornado at the beginning of the second half , Pel set up a goal with a pinpoint pass to teammate Mordechai Shpigler . Then he scored the tying goal by deflecting a Shpigler kick past Tornado Goalkeeper Ken Cooper with a deft flick of his head . <P> In 1974 he had announced his retirement from soccer and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accrued in his 18-year playing career for Santos of Brazil . They were substantial because his salary from Santos eventually reached $400,000 a year plus $8,000 a game for each of the approximately 30 exhibitions scheduled in a season . With endorsements , his income at one point was estimated at $2 million a year . The Cosmos , with the blessing of the Brazilian government , were able to lure the 34-year-old star back to the soccer pitch by offering him an estimated $4.5 million for three years . That sum is about twice the annual payrolls of all 20 teams in the North American Soccer League . <P> It is an investment that the Cosmos and the rest of the N.A.S.L. think well worth making . Soccer is attracting growing support in the U.S. , with thousands of high schools and more than 700 colleges now fielding teams . Attendance at professional games has also grown steadily . On opening day this spring , the San Jose Earthquakes attracted 18,000 fans , more than either the World Series champion Oakland Athletics or the San Francisco Giants drew for their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his sport to overcome . The game lacks the orchestrated tactics of football , the rapid-fire scoring of basketball and the internal rhythm of baseball . More important , it suffers from the fact that the majority of Americans do not comprehend and appreciate the game 's nuances . But Americans are rapidly learning to appreciate Pel . In his second game , the superstar drew a capacity crowd of 22,500 to New York City 's bush-league Downing Stadium to see the Cosmos beat the Toronto Metros , 2-0 . In Boston , at week 's end , Pel 's supporters proved to be too enthusiastic . While the Cosmos were playing a 1-1 tie with the Boston Minutemen , a swarm of fans rushed onto the field and knocked their idol down . This excessive outpouring of affection caused a leg injury , said to be minor , to the man who might become the savior of American soccer .
