txt Letters Letters About the Life and Death of Rae Edith Rose To the Editor : Last week Rae Edith Rose died in Bellevue Hospital . To the best of my knowledge , she was over 102 years of age . Because she was a patient of Bellevue 's Home Care Program , Mrs. Rose was able to maintain herself in her own home until approximately a week before her death . When I first met Mrs. Rose she was well into her 90 's . Her body was failing her , and she was angry . She had been trying to cope with the bureaucracy of the clinic , and that only made her more aware of her own vulnerability . A small , meticulous woman , she wore a neat veiled hat and white gloves , the trappings of a lady of another era . Her speech was precise ; her words were right to the point . She needed help . She was added to the list of patients in the Home Care Program . Mrs. Rose was not easy to work with and would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her independence . At first , the nursing staff had difficulty in acceptMg her , labeling her " uncooperative . " She rejected social workers as " dogooders , " even though she needed the services only they could provide . For a while she was not comfortable in relating to our nurses ' aides , because they were black and her contacts with this group had been very limited . They sensed it but never let it interfere with the way they responded to her . As time passed , mutual respect and real affection developed between her and all the staff . We became ' her family . She learned to accept our help without being threatened , and we learned to look at the aging process and its consequences with less fear . A very independent woman , Mrs. Rose never revealed too much about herself , We knew she came from the New England region and was very proud of her " Yankee know-how . " Widowed when she was 19 , she was left on her own . She told us how she became a dressmaker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and velvets , putting on fashion shows and traveling to sell her work . Once she showed me a picture of some of her dresses . They had the look of the World War I period . Apparently her business thrived until the Depression , when illness struck and her financial problems began . That was the start of her long relationship with Bellevue Hospital ( she would have been in her 50 's at that time ) . When her health stabilized , Mrs. Rose resumed her craft , but she was never able to regain her former status . The memorial service in the Bellevue Episcopal Chapel was attended by a few friends and the staff of the Home Care Department . The minister who officiated was one of her Bellevue " family . " It was a very meaningful experience for all of us . A goal had been established at the dine Mrs. Rose was placed on the Home Care Program : to assist the patient in her efforts to maintain her independence in her own home for as long as it is safe and practical . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Care staff , Mrs. Rose was able to live and die on her own terms  --  with dignity . MARION E. EaNut : Elmhurst , N.Y. , March 3 , 1977 . The writer is former administrator of the Bellevue Home Care Department . Forest Wilderness : The Better Caretaker To the Editor : Under Federal governmental reorganization , the U.S. Forest Service should be transferred from the Department of Agriculture to the Department of the Interior . During the 1930 's , Secretary of the Interior Harold Ickes recommended to President Roosevelt that he make such a transfer to consoljdate Federal landmanagement policy . Conditions have changed dramatically since then , especially since the J964 Wilderness Act . Under this act , the U.S. Forest Service is responsible for the preservation of large tracts of American wilderness . The spirit of wilderness preservation is frequently sold short in Agriculture , where the philosophy is inherently maximizing the harvest ( i.e. , trees ) . The Department of the Interior with the wildlife refuges , national parks and To the Editor : The mass of robins may be holding back this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ editorial implies ( Feb. 27 ) : and it may be , too , that writers of editorials are obliged to deal largely with the mass phenomenon and the statistically significant trend . Yet the single bird , like the letter writer , remains free to take an idiosyncratic stance : witness a hardy robin which has spent the winter in Flatbush , contra opinionem oinnium , attracted no doubt by the red berries which still cluster on certain Brooklyn College trees . JOHN VAN SICKLE Brooklyn , Feb. 28. 1977 Stop To the Editor : The present situation among the various agencies in New York City 's financial hassle seems to bear a definite similarity to that visualized in a law which reputedly existed in the state of Texas : " When two trains approach each other at a grade crossing , both shall stop , and neither shall start until the other has left . " JOHN J. SHIVELY New York , March 6 , 1977 To the Editor : I wonder if there are others who deplore the selection of elected and appointed officials based in large part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The practice is repugnant , whether its use is explicitly admitted or a euphemism or contrived justification is mentioned instead . The sickening trend has spread like an epidemic in the last several months at the Federal , state and city levels .

Jew and Protestant as nominees for Mayor , City : outlet President and Comptroller . I . vas. always troubled  --  and still am ? ay claims to a Jewish seat on the U.S. Supreme Court , that a black must be Borough President of Manhattan and ) y the urgency of having one or more xomen in the Cabinet . Yes  --  I understand the necessities of Dractical politics . But I am appalled , when my friends convert , by alchemy , : he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oppor:unity and numerical justice , If we : ontinue down this path . then why ndeed should there not be a claim nade by every group in our society ? Italian , Polish , German , Mexican , monutnents and other national preservation areas would be better suited as caretaker of the wilderness in our forests . With the creation of a new energy department , numerous agencies and responsibilities will be taken from Interior ; it . is thus timely that the U.S. Forest Service be transferred to fill the gaps . A strong , conservation-minded land-management department ( Interior ) is necessary now as America reaches into the final quarter of the century where the lines between development , recreation and preservation will more firmly be drawn . WILLIAM N. ROM New York , March 2 , 1977 The Trained Teacher To the Editor : I was greatly interested in your news story ( Feb. 26 ) on the amount of vandalism in the public schools , as reported by Senator Birch Bayh . According to the report , it came to about S600 million a year . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the teacher . As a classroom teacher myself for many years ? and at the junior high level , where troubles are supposed to be rampant ? I 've had no troubles in the last 15 years . And giving a good program in education , I had the respect of all my students and enjoyed teaching at the same time . I feel that the main factor in this approach to good teaching has been my training . But not from the teacher 's college : my Army training  --  for survival  --  and my experiences during World War II in a combat zone for almost 600 days . ' this has helped me survive ( in a nice manner ) and still give the kids a good education . I feel that if the government would start a good crash program for teachers on the art of how to survive ( nicely ) within the public-school classroom , in a few years most of the violence and destruction in the schools would disappear . SAMUEL SILVERSTE/N Torrington . Conn. , Feb. 28 , 1977 Swedish and the hundreds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the very fact of their being a distinct group . to their fair share of the political plums . In the long run , all groups will be given this type of recognition , and only competence , honesty and intelligence are likely to be subordinated . How proud we will all be some day when a nominee for public office can say : " Do n't insult me by asking how many women , blacks , Jews or Spanishspeaking people I will appoint . I will not appoint anyone , and I will not decline to appoint anyone , ? because of that person 's race . creed , ethnic origin or sex  --  and I will not support anyone who does ! " GEORGE SOLL New York , March 3 , 1977 To the Editor : C. L. Sulzberger 's Feb. 16 column points out the high degree of the Soviet , military buildup and asks , " Is d  --  tente just a means of continuing cold , war by other means ? " The answer , in my . opinion , is yes , because the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ geared for war and totally subordinated to ideological goals ( the ' spread of Lenin 's brand of Marxism ) . This fact was not only recognized by some Western economists but also . acknowledged by economists behind the Iron Curtain . Thus , Oscar Lange , . a well-known Communist economist and former member of the Polish Government , said more than thirty years ago that Soviet economic plan . ping , from its very beginning in the late 20 's , " did not serve the objectives of a harmonious socialist welfare economy , but served political and mill- : tary objectives to which all othte. aspects of economic planning were sacrificed . " The idea that indus7 , trialization of the country front its in-. ception ! tad only one purpose  --  to in-. crease as quickly as possible its war potential  --  was also indicated by Stalin in his speech of Feb. 9 , 1946 .

All in all , Moscow 's military preparations proceed with the same rapid pace in the current period of d  --  tente as they did during the years of the , cold war . Additionally , many Soviet leaders have a vested interest in the expansion of the military sector of the . economy and would strenuously resist , any plans advocating the limitation of the manufacturing of arms . NIKITA D. ROODKOWSNY Natick . Mass. , March 5 , 1977 Concorde to Newburgh ? To the Editor : Would the opening of a suitable airstrip at Stewart Field in Newburgh , N.Y. , be a possible way out of the Concorde dilemma ? Overseas jets have landed at Stewart in the past , and Customs services have been provided . Concorde passengers could deplane at Stewart , go through Customs there to waiting helicopters providing direct service to , say , the Pan Am Building heliport in mid-Manhattan .

KURTIS New York , March 7 , 1977 Our Fearsome Sirens To the Editor : Why ca n't a city siren be more like a signal  --  more a gesture of concern than a fear  --  provoking alarm ?
