Can current television sets be equipped to play recorded programs that could be purchased and stored like so many hi-fi discs ? Manufacturers have been competing for a decade to be first to provide a practical answer . Trouble is , both videotapes and films are too expensive to produce for the mass market . Standard long-playing records , which can be stamped out by the millions , can not carry all of the information necessary to produce TV images and sounds ; millions of electrical signals are required every second to create a TV picture . <P> Major Movies . Almost simultaneously , scientists in the U.S. and Europe have finally overcome the problem by combining the information capacity of videotape with the low cost of phonograph records . Their electronic hybrid is called the video disc-a relatively inexpensive record that can be played through a TV set to show everything from major Hollywood movies to educational and cultural features . By the end of 1976 , both RCA and a team composed of the N.V . Philips Co. in The Netherlands and MCA , the California @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. <P> At first glance , RCA 's SelectaVision and Philips-MCA 's Disco-Vision look virtually identical . Both systems use 12-in . LP-sized discs that play for 30 minutes* on a side on high-speed turntables . Each is connected to the standard TV set by simply attaching a pair of wires to the antenna leads . There the similarities end . Behind the systems are entirely different technologies ; the records used by one can not be played on the turntables of the other . <P> RCA 's engineers opted for a relatively simple turntable . A major innovation is the metal-coated record , which is covered with a spiral groove only 0.00018 in. wide-less than a tenth as thick as a human hair . In ordinary LPs , the groove encodes the sound ; as the pickup needle runs over its " hills and dales , " the needle is forced to vibrate at the same frequencies as the recorded sound . Translated into electrical pulses and amplified , the vibrations drive the loudspeaker . By contrast , RCA 's SelectaVision does not depend on mechanical vibrations . The disc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a series of irregularly spaced slots in the groove . The slots are so small ( up to 84,000 per in. ) that they must be etched into the master disc by an extremely fine , high-powered beam of electrons . Yet variations in the width and spacing of the slots contain all the information necessary to reproduce a program in color ( with stereo sound if desired ) . As the record spins at 450 r.p.m. , a metallic strip on the back of the stylus " reads " the constantly changing electrical capacitance -a measure of the capacity to hold an electrical charge-between the stylus and the disc 's slotted surface . The varying capacitance is electronically transformed into picture and sound .
