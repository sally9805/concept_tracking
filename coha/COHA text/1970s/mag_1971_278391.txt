TIME Correspondent Dan Coggin , who covered the war from the Pakistani side , was in Dacca when that city surrendered . His report : <P> FOR twelve tense days , Dacca felt the war draw steadily closer , with nightly curfews and blackouts and up to a dozen air raids a day . It was a siege of sorts , but one of liberation . Until the last few days , when it appeared that Pakistani troops would make a final stand in the city , the Indian army was awaited calmly and without fear . Most people went about their usual business - offices were open , rickshas running and pushcarts plying . The sweet tea of the street stalls drew the same gabby old fellows with white beards . The mood of the overwhelming majority of Bengalis was less one of apprehension than pent-up anticipation . Said one Bengali journalist : " Now we know how the Parisians felt when the Allies were approaching . " <P> The Indian air force had knocked out the Pakistanis ' runways and , out side of the limited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freely as if they were at an air show . I was surprised at the extent to which India could do no wrong in the eyes of the Bengalis . They showed me through rocketed houses where about 15 people had died . Several Bengalis whispered that it must have been a mistake , and I heard no one cursing the Indians . <P> In the final two days of fighting , the Indians put rockets on the governor 's house , starting a small fire and bringing about the prompt resignation of the Islamabad-appointed governor and his cabinet of so-called dalals , or " collaborators . " They fled to the eleven-story Hotel Intercontinental , a Red Cross neutral zone that became a haven for foreigners , minorities and other likely targets . Thanks to three gutsy British C-130 pilots who made pinpoint landings on the heavily damaged airfield , all who wanted to go went , including two mynah birds and a gray toy poodle named " Baby " that had been on tranquilizers for a week . <P> Also at the hotel were all of ex-Governor A.M. Malik @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minor parties . They are expected to face trial as war criminals . Their wives and other Pakistani women lived in fear , and the frequent moaning from their rooms at the Intercontinental contrasted eerily with the noisy candlelight poker and chess games of the correspondents who were not standing four-hour guard duty to keep out intruders . The hotel roof could hardly have been a better place for TV crews to grind away at air strikes . During the raids , shrapnel was occasionally fished out of the swimming pool , and a large time bomb planted in the hotel was disarmed and replanted in a trench on the nearby lawns . Beer soon ran out , but there was always fish or something else tasty for those cured of curry . <P> Outside the city , reporters had to go looking for the war , and for the first few days they found the countryside , more often than not , as peaceful as North Carolina during military maneuvers . " We 'll give those buggers a good hammering " had been a favorite boast of Pakistani officers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the outnumbered and outgunned Pakistani units fought it out in pitched battles .
