Rogers to the American-built Tunis university campus here today was canceled after an anti-American demonstration by students . While Rogers arrived here last night and was warmly greeted by Foreign Minister Habib Bourguiba Jr. , hundreds of students chanting anti-American slogans were kept at bay by police three miles away . The crowd was finally dispersed without violence after distributing literature blaming the United States for encouraging Israeli " aggression " against Arab states .
