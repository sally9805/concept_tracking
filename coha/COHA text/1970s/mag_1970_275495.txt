Okay pigs , now listen and listen good . There 's a bomb in the Army Math Research Center-the university-set to go off in five minutes . Clear the building . Warn the hospital . This is no bull- , man . <P> RADICAL bombers have become rather sophisticated with explosives in the past few months , but on this occasion their timer was off . At 3:42 a.m. , less than two minutes after police in Madison , Wis. , received the telephone warning , a blast tore through the University of Wisconsin 's Sterling Hall , destroying the math center and parts of the school 's physics and astronomy departments . In the wreckage were the center 's computer , valued at about $500,000 , the lifework of five physics professors and the doctoral research of 24 Ph.D . candidates . And because the warning came too late , Physicist Robert E. Fassnacht , 33 , was killed , and four other men were injured . <P> Last week , on the eve of the fall college semester , there were other explosions . A fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , police headquarters . In Seattle , a bomb exploded in an unoccupied building that until four months ago was the state headquarters for the American Legion . At Harvard 's John F. Kennedy School of Government , an employee called police in time for them to dismantle a timed fire bomb found in a kitchen . And in Tulsa , Okla. , District Judge Frederick S. Nelson was seriously injured when a bomb wired to the ignition of his station wagon exploded . <P> Political Rationale . Tom Hayden , one of the founders of the Students for a Democratic Society , likes to tell sympathizers that " fear of violence must be overcome . It is part of change . Our violence over the last ten years is equal to striking a match , compared to one bomb from a B-52 . " But if some radicals are overcoming their reticence to blow things up , other Americans are growing both fearful and impatient with the new Bakuninism that is detonating across the country . <P> A small minority of radicals is increasingly communicating its politics in the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last April , there were 4,330 bombings across the U.S. They killed at least 40 persons and injured 384 . Right-wing extremists and racists account for some of the destruction . Personal grudges are also involved in many minor bombings . Only two persons have been killed in campus explosions , but the few political radicals who are " into violence " are now practicing it almost routinely-and with increasing expertise-as a necessary instrument of revolution . <P> After the Wisconsin bombing last week , Governor Warren Knowles angrily pronounced it " an insane act . " Whether or not the bombing was clinically pathological , it did have a twisted political rationale . Officials at the math center maintain that they work only on " pure research " projects , nonclassified problems that may be of interest to industry as well as to the military . Although the Army this year allocated $1,200,000 for the center , the university says that most of its staff members are civilians .
