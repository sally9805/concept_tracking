To all outward appearances , the drama that ran at the Teatro General San Martin in Buenos Aires during the past month had all the color and excitement of a library reading room . There , sitting in mute isolation on the vast stage , two men huddled over a small table for hours like grad students cramming for their final exams . At the slightest stir in the sellout audience of 1,200 , red signs flashed SILENCIO . The tension was almost palpable . Grand Masters Bobby Fischer of the United States and Tigran Petrosian of the Soviet <P> Union were playing for the privilege of meeting Russia 's Boris Spassky this spring for the world chess championship . <P> The matchup between the wily Armenian and the Brooklyn kid was a classic encounter of East v. West , old pro v. young upstart . Ticket scalpers asked - and got-triple the cost of admission . Hundreds of other enthusiasts stood in line for up to nine hours to buy tickets . For each game in the best-of-twelve series , the theater was filled with elegant ladies peering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on pocket chess sets . Another 3,000 fans crowded into the lobby , where they could watch and argue each move as it was relayed from the stage to a huge demonstration board . Radio Argentina provided play-by-play coverage , and an international team of reporters filed stories to an estimated 60 million chess players round the world . <P> Last week , during the crucial ninth game , the flashing SILENCIO signs could not still the sudden bursts of applause . Finally , after four hours and 27 minutes , Petrosian studied the shattered remains of his French Defense and resigned the game-and the match-to Fischer . While hundreds of fans jostled into the auditorium chanting " Bobbee ! Bob-bee ! , " Fischer disappeared out the stage door and went bowling till 3:30 a.m . Headlined the Buenos Aires daily Cronica : A GENIUS , WITHOUT A DOUBT . At Moscow 's Central Chess Club the reaction was summed up by one player who sighed : " Well , we 've still got Spassky . " <P> At home the response was lukewarm at best . The New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bothered to send an expert ( U.S. Grand Master Robert Byrne ) to cover the match , ran most of its accounts on the obituary page . Said Fischer : " Around the world I 'm better known than Joe Namath . But in the States I 'm a nobody . "
