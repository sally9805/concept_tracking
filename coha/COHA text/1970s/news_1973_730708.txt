txt Wearing a beaded Indian necklace over his coat and , tie , the Rev. John Adams looks slightly harried from his long hours of trying to help avoid a repeat of the Wounded Knee massacre of 1890 that left several hundred Indians slain by federal troops . He is one of several key figures in the tense drama unfolding here . Mr. Adams , representing the National Council of Churches ( NCC ) , is a negotiator between the Indians and the federal forces surrounding Wounded Knee , He has been alternately criticized by the Oglala Sioux tribal council , respected at arms length by the U.S. Department of Justice and praised by members of the U.S. Department of Justice and members of the American Indian Movement ( AIM ) . He has played an important role in keeping talks going , no matter how tenuous or sporadic at times . Washington consultation Also helping shape events here is chief federal negotiator Harlington Wood , an assistant attorney general recently returned to Wounded Knee after consulting in ' Washington with high officials from the Departments of Justice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposal . But a negotiating session was arranged the same day by the Rev. Mr. Adams , who drove Mr. Wood to Wounded Knee for the talks . // // " Meaningful negotiation can not be delayed any longer for whatever reason , " said Mr. Adams , standing in the occupied grocery store at Wounded Knee and surrounded by armed Indians . " It is frequently recited in this country that revolution can not come at the end of a gun , " he told the Indians and newsmen . " But neither , really , does law and order , justice and stability , come at the end of a gun . " Arriving at Wounded Knee March 2 from Washington , Mr. Adams said , " any Indian knows this confrontation was long overdue . " He indicated at that time that the stalemate was " too far gone " for a sudden end . Days later , looking gaunt but hopeful , he commented on the history of broken agreements and treaties with Indians . " The government has not kept Many of their agreements ? agreements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States . The broken promises have caused broken lives . " Those broken lives of Indians are reflected in the defiance of two others in the drama : Dennis Banks and Russell Means , the principal AIM leaders . Both men are in their middle 30 's , urban-oriented , have prison records , and helped organize AIM in 1.968 in Minneapolis , out of frustration with " the white man 's ways . " Never denying their prison records , the two tall men have deftly cultivated the news media at Wounded Knee , explaining again and again their reasons for leading the takeover . " This is not a new conflict , " says Mr. Means . " We are trying to save our way of life . Indian people have been peaceful for years . We have been trying to deal with the courts and the - white man 's ways , but-it is impossible . This is where we stand until changes are made . " Both men have been indicted for their actions at Wounded Knee by a Sioux City , S.D. , grand jury . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with authorities across the United States . Offstage here , but angry and vocal , is Richard Wilson , the current chairman of the Oglala Sioux tribe at the Pine Ridge Reserva tion , which includes Wounded Knee . A short , slim man , Mr. Wilson has clashed verbally with the Rev. Mr. Adams . He openly attacks members of the AIM as " renegades " and demands that its leaders and followers be jailed and federally prosecuted . Mr. Wilson has been the object of impeachement moves several times over the last few months , but Indians here say this is nothing new at Pine Ridge . Most clergymen in the Pine Ridge area , Mr. Wilson says , disapprove of Mr. Adams 's actions . Last week at Mr. Wilson 's urging , the tribal council passed a resolution directed at NCC and AIM demanding their banishment from the reservation . Meanwhile , cautious , low-key and softspoken Mr. Wood of the Justice Department has gained the respect of AIM leaders by keeping a low profile .
