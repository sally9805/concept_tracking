swung the bow in , slowed the engines even more , flipped on the depth finder and left it on , watching the needle indicate shallower and shallower bottom . " What are you doing here ? " " Take the wheel , will you ? When I say to , push both throttles in . " He swung over the ladder . " What are you going to do ? " she shouted after him . He was already on the forward deck . " Put the anchor over . " He waited , looking down , as the bow edged closer to shore . " Now , " he said . She pushed in the red plastic tops of the throttles . He tossed the anchor away , the line falling smoothly . He payed out slowly , letting the arms catch , then secured with a quick hitch to the cleat . " Okay , " he said , still not looking up . He went into the main cabin and turned off the motor . Caroline climbed down slowly and followed him . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Change of plan . You were asleep and I did not want to wake you . " " Damn it , Giles , what are you talking about ? " " It 's a warm day , more warm than it ever is this time of year , the sun is hot , there is no wind here in the lee , so I anchored to have a drink and a swim . " " Robert will be furious . " " A sailor who has just lost his mast because he is an idiot ca n't complain if rescue is delayed a little while . " And Caroline shrugged . " That 's so true . " He pulled off his sun glasses . " I 've been plotting for years to get you all to myself on a desert island . " " Oh for heaven 's sake . . . Now I wish I 'd brought a suit . " " There are some in the lockers below .

If Godfried was here , we could ask him , or I bet your boys could tell us . . . " " Yes , " he said , " yes . . . But I do not think my sons would tell me . I am a proper European father , you see . One must speak properly to me . " " Even yes sir ? " Caroline teased , until she saw that he was not joking . " I have had them speak very properly to me , always . Andl have had them wear ties for dinner . I suppose they aredifferent with their mother . Mary tells me that they are ... " " I do n't think that American children show enough respect for their parents , " Caroline suggested lamely . " Yes ? " For a moment he seemed about to say something else . ( What , Caroline wondered , what ? ) But instead he turned and went below . As Caroline waited for him to change , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she answered herself : Do n't be so silly . Giles came back , in bathing trunks this time , his slight , almost hairless body reflecting the sun smoothly . " You need a tan , " she said . " You never tan . " " I do n't want to . " He had a good body . Really amazingly good when you remembered his age ; he must be close to fifty . No , not that old . " I 'm forty-four , " he said . She jumped guiltily . " What ? " He put his dark glasses back on . " I was twenty-three when I married Mary in 1943 . " " Giles , you 're a mind reader . " " No , " he said . " I just know by now how the family thinks . " " Now really , Giles , stop thinking of me as the family  --  anyway not in that tone ! "  | " My apologies , madam . I have never thought of you as my sister-in-law or my brother-in-law 's wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always thought of you as something else . . . Now go put on your bathing suit . " He swung a towel to his shoulder . " While you are finding one that fits you , I will have a bit of sun on the foredeck and then we will have a swim together . " She went below and began to rummage in the lockers there . She heard his bare feet pad along the deck , check the anchor line . He began to whistle softly , a tune she did not recognize . She found three suits that were about her size , a black and two blue prints . She thought about them for a moment , then she lifted the forward hatch which was right over her head . " Giles , are these the only suits ? " " I suppose so . " " One is new , it still has the tag . " " Somebody did not like to swim . " " And they are all bikinis . " He chuckled . " I will promise to look only in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the mirror , and then put on the largest of the blue prints . She pinned up her hair , decided not to wear a cap , and swung through the hatch to the deck . He opened one eye . " Giles , " she said , " this is not my size . " " You have a lovely figure , " he said quietly . " You should wear suits like that always . " " Robert would n't hear of it . " " I remember the one you had on the trip last year -- formy birthday . It was greenish  --  with a lot of pleats . " He was right . " How on earth did you remember that ? " " I told you  --  I always look at you . It was a terrible suit . " " Oh do n't be so silly . . . Let 's swim in now . " They put the ladder over the stern and climbed down into the water . It was cold and salty and absolutely clear . Caroline shivered and puffed and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her head high , and her hair out of the water . Giles paced alongside , popping up and down like a gray porpoise . It was a longish swim , and she was unused to any exertion . Her neck began to hurt from the unusual way she was carrying her head . She gave up the crawl , and rested a moment , treading . " Are you all right ? " Giles asked immediately . " Yes , " she said disgustedly . " It 's just old age . " She shifted into a breast stroke , and felt better . The bra slipped to her waist and hung there . Well , stay there , she thought furiously . Just stay there . She concentrated on the water and the motions of her body . The soft smooth flow of the water , the soft aching motions of her muscles , the labored pulse of her breathing . She was so busy with this that she swam straight into the sand shallows . Startled , she tucked her legs under her and jerked up the bra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Later it would be rimmed with boats and echoing with the shouts of drunks and the roar of outboards . " It 's a beautiful cove , " she said , and her voice was shaky and breathless . " You are winded . " " I told you  --  I 'm an old lady ... " " I 've never known why there are not any houses on this particular island . There are on all the others . " She settled herself back against a dune and pulled a pink flower from a beach pea vine . " There used to be houses , " she said , " until that big hurricane in ' 38 . They were all washed away then , not even a foundation left . And there was n't a single survivor  --  I 'm not sure they ever found the bodies . It was like there never had been anything here . And nobody has ever come back . " " Ah , " Giles said , " yes . " He built himself a chair of sand , scooping out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down in it , tipped back his head and closed his eyes . " The sun is warm . . . " " That 's a lot of trouble for a few minutes ' rest . . . I just flop down on the sand . " He turned his head slightly and looked at her , but did not answer . His pale hard body gleamed with the salt water . I shall have a terrible sunburn , Caroline thought , as she slid down , put her hands behind her head , and , closing her eyes , stretched carefully and slowly , like a cat . Then only the speckles of the sun behind her closed lids . The small sounds of water at the rim of the sand . The far-off screech of gulls . And the smell of the beach , of all lee beaches , the sun-perfected odor of decay from useless things along the tide line , sea wrack . Of seaweed , of barnacles and sea snails left by the tide . Of tiny black mussels and white clams . Of half-empty shells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strained to hear the rattle of stone on chitin , but heard only waves and the easing wind . Giles was sitting up , close to her . " Did you hear me ? " " No , " she said , " I was thinking , I 'm afraid . " " Of what ? " " The smell of beaches , mostly . " " Millions of little dead things . " " I know . The useless things . . . " She rolled over . " I 'll get some sun on my back . . . Giles , these are n't Mary 's suits ; she 's bigger than I. " " No , " he said . " You do n't care if people know ? " " Know what ? " " That you 're not happy with Mary ? " He chuckled . " What a puritan you are ; no wonder Robert married you . Of course I am happy with Mary . " " Oh , " she said . " Giles , have you ever helped Robert ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know . Have you ever got him a job or lent him money or put him through school or anything like that ? " He looked amused . " No , madam . Your husband is one of the members of my family who has never needed help . He is a very able man . " " And a bad sailor . " " Overeager , " Giles said . " He would be a good man in a race . " " Well "  --  Caroline was matter-of-fact  --  " all he 's got now is a broken mast . " Giles said abruptly : " Come back to the boat . " He took her hand to help her up , held it as they waded into the water . She said nothing until they were waist deep and then she asked : " Why rush back now ? " " Because , " he said quietly , " it is too difficult making love on the sand . " He pushed her off . " Now go ! " All the long swim back she thought of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water past her body . " Let me go first , " he said at the ladder , " then I will give you a hand . " He was up quickly , leaning back over the cowling to grasp both her wrists . She put her feet on the ladder rungs and swung up . As the hot sun hit her body she realized that the bra had slipped to her waist again , but he still held her wrists and she did nothing about it . " Aphrodite from the sea , " he said lightly , " all you need is a seashell . " You are disturbed , she thought , you smooth gray and blue and white creature , you are disturbed and your voice is not steady . She stood very quietly before him , salt water running down her naked body , cold and hot at once , water and sun . She did not make the slightest motion . Robert has never asked for anything from you , she thought . And I will never ask either . . . It is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the open empty waters of the cove . " How silly we 'd feel if another boat appeared . " " Sex is what boats are for . " " What your boat is for . Not everybody 's . " " Yes , " Giles said , handing her a folded towel . " Robert 's boat would be for sailing . . . Of course it would . " Caroline shrugged . " Robert would never make love on a thin cushion on a blazing deck . . . no . He never went in for sex in the raw . " " Do you think that 's what it is ? " Giles was standing directly in front of her . She went on drying her arms , and then pushed him away so that she could bend over and rub the towel along her legs . " Some people call it a tumble in the hay , " she remarked to the deck . " I am going to be sunburned , for the first time in my life . " " You are a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's all in the " family . " For one moment she thought he would slap her , but that moment passed and nothing happened . He only began to button his plaid shirt . And sat down to put on his shoes . " I do n't understand , " he said . " Are you sorry ? " " No , no indeed . " They raised anchor . Caroline worked the shiny electric winch while Giles maneuvered the boat , then they were clear of the cove and running eastward . She settled down on the flying bridge , next to him . They said nothing until the hazy shape of Boar Island appeared . " The west end , " she said . " There 's plenty of water , right up to the dock there . " Giles nodded . Abruptly she put her hand over his on the pitted aluminum wheel . " Poor Giles ... " " Not if I see you again . " " Poor me then . " He was looking steadily ahead , not turning . She foundp25herself staring into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I never noticed that your hair was curly , " she said softly . " I suppose I have n't looked . " He said , " You must . " His eyes were following the coast , looking for the cove where Robert and Guppy waited . " I expect to , " she said . He turned then , and the level blue eyes ( dark and quiet now ) watched . " The anchor is still wet . " Caroline nodded to it . " Robert will not notice . " " I did n't mean that . I meant that 's all there 's left , " Carolinesaid , " some weed on the anchor and some salt dried on our skin . " " There is n't ever much left , when it 's done . " I know , Caroline thought . I know that . But why should it bother me.  |p26The  baby woke at two , stirred and chirped , the twittery nervous sound of morning birds . Without turning on a light , Nofa swung herself over the edge of the bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it next to her , pulling the covers over them both . Quietly Harry listened , as he had every morning these last three weeks , ever since the child had come home . He knew every movement and every sound by now  --  same sounds , same order every night . The little puffs of breathing , almost like pain , when Nora roused herself : Uh , uh . Little whistles of breath , in and out , shivering in the cold room . And the soft rubbing of the sheets across his own body . The squeak of the plastic cover on the baby 's mattress , as her hands slipped under the little body . She probably did n't once open her eyes . Harry thought . " Shush , shush , " she said , " take it now . " It was the only thing she ever said at night . As soon as the baby fastened on the nipple , she was silent again . It seemed to him sometimes that he could feel the tension in that fragment of flesh , feel the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had given the child his finger once , and had been surprised by the strong pull . But then he 'd been surprised at a lot of things.  |p27He  opened his eyes in the dark , but saw nothing beyond the shadowy window and the arc of the curtain across it . Nora was completely out of sight in the covers . She would be lying on her side , turned toward him , the child nuzzling into the swollen flesh . He marveled at her breasts , now heavy and blue-veined . She 'd been such a slight woman with small high breasts , tight breasts that changed abruptly into bulging udders . You could almost see the milk inside them , ready to run out at the first touch . Whenever he was home he sat and watched her feed the child . " What 's the matter with you ? " she said . He only shook his head , not trying to explain . Only one other thing had ever fascinated him this much . Once in the country , when he was eight or so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into an open spring , stretched flat out on the tiles that surrounded it , staring down through the clear water to the stone-lined bottom where the source was . The child was finished . Nora put it in the crib , covered it , and slipped back to bed . She moved a lot quicker at night , he thought , than she did all day long . . . She was asleep in less than a minute . He just never seemed to fall asleep until she was finished and back under the covers . He 'd never done that before the baby . In those days she could get up to read or knit , and he would not even stir . It was different now . . . My god , he thought , I 'm going to be a good father . You better believe it . He scrunched down farther in the bed , pulling his knees up to avoid the chill at the foot . Then there was just her light breathing , and the quiet cold air around his face , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half a mile away , nothing but woods and grass in between . Not even cattle in the old pastures now , which were waist high with weeds . All that would be a housing development  --  he would be sorry when they started building and the nights were full of people sounds . He liked the quiet and the emptiness . He liked the sense of no one being near his house . Especiallyon nights like these , clear and starry.  |p28An  occasional truck whistled its air brakes at the interchange , then shifted three or four times as it pulled away . Some nights when he did n't sleep well , he counted the gears . Tonight there were hardly any trucks , just the occasional brush of tires , once a squeal of brakes . Little sounds with long silences between . Nights like this you could sometimes hear the trains in the switching yards way across town . When they first moved to this house , he 'd taken the sounds for distant thunder , and gotten up and closed the windows against a sudden storm . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of cars , so that the crashes rolled out on the night air , muted and hollow with distance . But not tonight . The yards did not work on Sunday . He knew their schedules now , they 'd lived here almost a year . Sunday nights were quiet , just a little pulse of highway traffic . Now and then . The heavy sleepy air was all around him , thick and gentle . SO comfortable that he did not really notice the sound until he had heard it for quite a while . A different sound . He lifted his head off the pillow , just a bit , to break contact with the sleeping world . He hung his head there in mid air , until his tense muscles ached and quivered . He was awake and the sound was gone . It had n't been a sound anyway , he thought dully . It had been like a creak . Like a shift in the house timbers . Almost but not quite . His heart began knocking against his ribs . There was a tremor in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hands were standing up . A nightmare , he thought , I 'm having a nightmare . The sound again . This time his ears pinpointed it , his mind saw it . The kitchen window . Somebody was forcing it open . He shook his wife 's shoulder . " Somebody 's breaking in , " he said quietly . She always woke up slowly , and this time she did too . She lay silently rubbing her eyes . " Call the police . "  | " The phone 's in the kitchen , honey . " He spoke gently as if he had all the time in the world . " That 's where he is . " She sat up , her eyes round and shiny in the half light . He reached for his robe , found a sweater and put that on . " Where 'd we put the gun , Nora ? " " I do n't remember . . . The bottom drawer , under the pajamas , I think . " The floor boards were cold . There was no rug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the living room , and they were waiting to afford another . The drawer slipped open . It works a lot better in cold weather , he thought . He felt the lump under the pajamas : the 38 Special his father had given him . He swung open the cylinder and felt for the cartridgeshe could n't see in the dark . He 'd never fired this gun , but his father said it had a very stiff trigger . He remembered his father 's always intending to have it eased . The dull blue steel was almost invisible in his hand . He had n't even wanted the thing , but his father insisted . " Every householder 's got to have a gun . " Well , he had one now , and he did n't quite know what to do with it . He walked back to the bed , fingers curved around the trigger guard . His wife was tucking another cover over the baby . Funny , he thought , as if the burglar were going to make the house colder . " Where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She shook her head . " 1 do n't know . " " Well , " he said , " I do n't need them . I just want to give that guy the scare of his life . " She finished with the baby and stood up , waiting . " Lock the door to the hall , " he said softly , " but do n't turn on the lights . I 'm going out on the porch . " It was a small sun deck off the bedroom . " I 'm going to shoot down into the ground and yell my head off . So do n't you get scared . " She nodded . As he felt his way toward the porch there were more sounds below . Metallic sounds . What would that be ?  |p30I  wish my night vision were better , he thought . But then if it were I 'd have an air force commission and I 'd be off flyingsomewhere instead of standing here freezing like a brass monkey while I try to figure out sounds . His wife seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stairs . He motioned to her silently . Why did n't she do what he asked and lock that door ? It was bad enough sneaking around in the dark , without glasses , holding a gun you were n't even sure you could shoot . And all this on the coldest night of the year , he thought . Great night for playing cops and robbers . He turned the doorknob and nothing happened . Oh God , he thought , God Almighty . They did n't use the porch this time of year and the new paint had stuck the door closed . He shifted the gun to his left hand . He wanted to kick the door open , but instead put his shoulder to it and pushed , thumping softly to jar the paint free . I 've got to be making a hell of a lot of noise and if that guy is right below he 's got to hear me .. . He squinted through the breath-misted glass . Something moved in the side yard , across the frosty grass . Something quick , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scared him away , he thought . I can turn on the lights now and go down and have a cup of coffee and turn up the heat and laugh about it . How quick that guy moved , I never really did see him , never once , just his shadow . I felt him more than heard him . But his skin went on twitching . And he knew there had to be something else . Something else . Then he remembered . The metallic sound . That had n't come from the kitchen directly below . It had come from the side of the house . There was a door there , into the little room they called a study . He went on remembering . That door had a knob lock . You could put a wrench to it and twist and it would open . . . Something like that . It had to be something like that.  |p31So  there was n't one man , Harry thought , there were two . One is gone , but the second one did n't hear anything . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside the house . Harry 's brain moved so slowly he could see it shaping the thoughts . Like stringing beads on a string . One after the other , each examined carefully and placed in its spot . He 's inside my house . . . And Nora 's just standing there , she has n't even closed the door . He 's downstairs right now .. . He was turning around when she screamed . Not loud , but shrill , a siren sound . Afterward , he never could remember exactly what had happened . He was running ; he noticed how numb his feet were as they pounded against the boards . He knocked over the bedroom chair , stopped to pick it up and fling it aside . It must have hit the crib because the baby began shrieking . The bedroom lights went on , but he never remembered who touched the switch . Then he was running down the stairs , shifting the gun from his left hand to his right , following the sounds . The other man made a wrong turn , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was running too , confused and blundering in the dark . In the dining room somethingfell and broke . The swinging door to the kitchen fluttered and creaked . Something heavy sailed past Harry 's shoulder and smashed into a wall on his left . He threw something at me , he thought . I almost caught him . The thought of that closeness elated him . . . Almost got him . . . That and anger . . . He 's in my house , breaking my furniture ! The other man found the kitchen door , flung it open . Harry , still following , squinted nearsightedly into the dark yard . He saw the other man then , saw him as a blur at the far corner of the yard , couple of hundred feet away . There was a metal fence across there , fairly high . On the other side were azaleas  --  with just the beginning scatter of blooms this timep32of year  --  gone wild , grown taller than a man ; and clumps of ligustrum and hackberry . A thick tangled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one hand on the top of the fence , ready for the swinging leap to the other side . Later , Harry wondered why the man had hesitated . Was he checking his directions ? Looking for the second man ? Catching his breath ? But why do that when he was , even in his dark clothes , visible in the light from the upstairs bed-room ? Afterwards , Harry was sure he used his revolver only because he saw a still figure . He would never have fired at a running target ; that was an impossible shot . But a figure stationary even for a second . . . his arm swung up and the gun fired . He thought : I missed , I was way off . At night people aim too high . Always aim too high. - The figure rose and swung horizontally over the fence . In Harry 's mind , it hung there , suspended there , a line across the fence . He fired again . As his hand squeezed closed on the now warm metal , he thought : This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bushes , down under the covering tangle . He blinked and stared but could n't see . He tried to listen but all he heard was Nora calling : " Harry , Harry ! Where are you , Harry ? " She snapped on the outside light . He squinted in the glare but still could n't see clearly . He just could n't manage without his glasses ; he would have to go back and get them . " Harry , you need this ! " She was standing in the door , the baby in one arm , his overcoat in the other . She held the coat out to him ; standing on the top step he put it on , then he went inside . The oven door hung open . He closed it silently . " Harry , I opened that to warm up the place a bit . " " Oh sure . " He had supposed somehow that it had come open during his dash through the room.  |p33The  kitchen window was splintered . " We 'll have to fix that , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it wo n't lock . " So she 'd had time to see to that . And light the oven . He 'd been outside longer than he 'd thought , staring at that one spot in the brush . " Did you see him ? " he asked . Nora shook her head . " You started screaming . " " But I did n't see anything . " The baby was asleep again . She put it down . Shivering , he stood by the open oven . " I have to call the police , " he said . " I think I hit him . I 'm sure I hit him . " " I 'll call them , " she said , " while you get warm . " He held his hands in the open oven , feeling sensation come back with a sharp sting . She finished with the phone and gave it a quick wipe with a dishcloth . She always did that . She liked the shiny white surface . " You know the Lalique vase in the dining room , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was their only good wedding present . She dusted it every day and washed it carefully in ammonia every Monday morning . " I 'm sorry , honey , " he said , " maybe the insurance will cover it or something . " " I could hear it breaking . I knew that 's what it was . " " We ran through there . I guess that 's when . " " There 's a wrench on the dining room floor . And a big gash on the wall . " How had she had time to see so much . . . " I 'll look in just a minute , honey . " If it had hit him he 'd be lying on the floor now . " The coffee 's hot enough . " " Okay , " he said . " Fix me a cup while I get my glasses . " He got his shoes too , and as soon as he finished the coffee , he began putting them on . He 'd forgotten socks and the lacesp34knotted ; he stood up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going out , Harry ? " " I shot at him . I ought to go see what I did . " " Out there ? " She pulled her robe tighter and walked to the kitchen window , the one with the splintered frame . " He tried to kill you , Harry . " " No . He did n't . " " He threw that wrench hard or it would n't have left a hole like that in the plaster . It could have killed you . " She did n't miss much , he thought . " Well , he did n't , honey . " She kept on staring at the dark outside . " There were two men , Harry , were n't there ? And if you did hit one and he 's still out there , he 'd try to kill you again . " He shook his head stubbornly . " No . " " Or while you 're out , he could sneak back here . " " With all the lights on and the police coming ? " " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her arms under her breasts , tightly , as if she were holding on to herself . " I thought , " she said to the night-glazed glass , " that a man wanted to protect his wife and his child . " He put down the coffee cup . That was it . Of course that was it . He could n't leave her and the child while he went chasing shadows . He had to stay with her . " Okay , " he said . She turned around then , still holding to her body . " I 'm scared now . Just think what it would be like if you were n't here . " " I guess I 'm too mad . " " Yes , " she said , " I guess you are . " " Because somebody was sneaking around in my house . And because he woke me up , and I was cold . I really tried to hit him with that second shot because I was just plain mad ... Does that make any sense to you ? " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe . " And that was her way of sayingno . " You ought to have something to eat.  | " The police 'll be along . " She made fresh coffee . He stood at the window , looking out across the back yard , wearing his glasses , staring as hard as he could at the darkness beyond the circle of light . " Can you see anything ? " she asked . He shook his head . " Not even the police ? " " I do n't know how long it 's been since you called them . I did n't look at the clock . . . maybe I did n't hit him , " he said . " I never was a good shot . " " If you wanted to hit him , " she said , " you did . " She said it with such certainty that he left his window to give her a hug and a kiss . And it was then the police came . Three prowl cars parked outside the front door , four policemen and a state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said quietly , " now that we do n't need them any more . " Three policemen went through the house . " Want to be sure he is n't hiding in here somewhere . " She shivered . " I did n't think of that . " The fourth policeman and the state trooper went outside . Harry stood in the kitchen door and watched them . " There is n't any gate in the back fence , " he called , his voice loud in the silent cold , " you have to jump it or go around by the side of the house . " " Go ahead , boy , " the policeman said to the trooper , " jump it . " " Always got to be a comedian , " the other said . They came back across the yard , right hand on holster , as rules required , left slapping thighs for warmth . They were about the same size , and they looked pretty much alike to Harry . " What 's the other side of the fence ? " one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in there , " Harry said . " A swamp , " the trooper said disgustedly . " Every place I go , I got to find a swamp . "  | " It is n't very close to the fence , " Harry said quickly . " The ground 's dry for a hundred feet the other side of the fence . " " I 'll still end up in the swamp , " the man said . The others came out of the house . " Nothing in there , mister . " Harry said . " He went over the fence , one of them . I do n't know where the other one went . " " We 'll take a look . " " Close the door , Harry , " Nora said when they were gone . " You 'll freeze the baby . " " All right , " he said and moved to the window . They were on the other side of the fence . He could see the little points of their flashlights flickering in the brush . They 'd be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything with the window closed . He got tired standing and , not shifting his eyes , he hooked a chair with his foot , dragged it to him , and sat down . He was trying to count the lights . There should be five , but he never could seem to see them all at once . They seemed to be keeping pretty close to the fence . He hoped they 'd rememberabout the swamp , the water was always highest in winter . With the irregular ground you could step in before you realized where you were . He 'd been down there only once  --  last year right after they moved in . Then the swamp was filled with sprouting yellow-green pitcher plants . They were supposed to be fly catchers , those plants . He wondered if that was true . He 'd never got around to finding out . Behind him , Nora sat down in the rocking chair that she used when she was feeding the baby . She sat quietly in it , waiting , with only an occasional creak when she shifted her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door . She jumped in her chair . " Oh , " she said , " It 's you . I 'm just edgy . " The trooper came inside , slapped his hands together four or five times before he pulled off his gloves . " Cold job this time of year . "  |p37His  tone is different , Harry thought . His tone is different . Not louder . No , the other way around . He 's speaking perfectlyquietly . But there is n't a lift to his voice , there is n't any intonation to it at all . And if he were speaking naturally there 'd be something , there always is . One word would n't come behind the other , so neatly , so closely , one after the other , sheep jumping a fence , beads on a string . Nora did n't seem to notice . " Would you like some coffee , officer ? " " No ma'am . " He turned abruptly , his cold-reddened face showing bright blue eyes . " The man who was in the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at him ? " You 've found him , Harry thought . Aloud he said , " He was standing by the fence in the back corner , right where that little azalea bush is . He must have run across the yard , after he took the wrong turn and went into the yard instead of out the side door . " " He was running when you shot ? " " Well "  --  Harry hesitated  --  " he stopped for a minute , I think . I shot and he jumped just about the same time , I guess . " " There was a lot of crashing around , and things breaking , " Nora said , " when he tried to hit Harry with the wrench and smashed my vase instead . " " It happened pretty fast . " " They always do , " the trooper said . " He tried to kill you with the wrench ? " Harry hesitated again , not liking the sound of those words . " Maybe he could see more than me  --  I do n't see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glasses anyway  --  so maybe he did mean to hit me , and I guess the wrench could have killed me . " He could see two flashlights outside , they were swinging back and forth , crossing the yard . The police were coming back . He was so busy watching them he forgot to listen. "  --  if you make a formal statement , " the trooper was saying . " And your wife too . "  | " Did I hit him ? You mean I hit him ? " " You killed him , " the trooper said . The rocking chair had stopped creaking . There was just the dripping tap at the kitchen sink . Harry reached over and pressed it closed , so even that sound stopped . He could hear muffled voices outside now . They must be very close to the house ; he had n't been able to hear them before . " I ca n't even see very well at night , " Harry said , " that 's why I could n't be a flyer in the navy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " You did n't go out after him ? " " No , " Harry said , " I stayed here . " " I was afraid to have him go , " Nora said abruptly . There 's something different in her tone , too , Harry thought . All of a sudden everybody 's different with me . " I begged him to stay here with me . " " I 'd have stayed too , " the trooper said . " You got to protectyour family . " Harry asked : " Why did you want to know if I 'd gone out ? Would it have made a difference ? " " We were a long time getting here , " the trooper said . " The town did n't have a unit to send and by the time they got around to calling headquarters and headquarters got me , I was way over by the county line on Dowman Road . Must have taken us near an hour to get here . " " It was pretty long . " " You never know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the brush , not alone . " " We do n't have any near neighbors , " Nora said . " No one to help . " " I do n't know how I hit him , " Harry said . " I have n't fired a gun in years . " The other police had n't come into the house at all , they must have gone around to their cars . Nora and the trooper seemed to be talking , but Harry did n't listen . There was a funny shaking in the middle of his chest and he concentratedp39on that . Nora touched his arm . " You 're supposed to sign this , Harry . " Not reading it , he did . " One unit 'll stay , " the trooper said . " You might see their lights out there , so do n't worry about it . " He began pulling his gloves back on . " One of the men thinks he recognized him . He was a kid out on bail from Winn County . Looks like he went back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good a shot , " Harry said . " I never have been . " " You were just lucky , " the trooper said . " Happens like that . People make lucky shots all the time . " Harry did not notice when he left . But when he looked around again , the trooper was gone . The room seemed extra quiet and very empty . It was getting warm now too . He could feel beads of sweat in the creases of his neck . He poured himself a cup of coffee . He did n't really want it , but he could n't think of anything else , and he wanted to be doing something . He wanted his hands to keep moving . " What are we going to do about locking the door ? " Nora asked . She was still sitting in the rocker ; she had begun to move it lazily back and forth . The side door , where the lock was wrenched open . " I 'll fix it tonight after work . " " When you 've finished with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes , " he said , " this time of year , I got to be there . " " I 'll be scared here alone . " " Go by your mother 's and I 'll pick you up at five-thirty . " The rocker creaked some more . " No , " she said , " I 'll stay . If you 've got a house you got to look out for it . " I did , he thought . I sure did . " You do n't feel bad about not going after him ? " she said . " You ca n't . " " No , " he said , " I had to stay with you . " " You heard what the trooper said . You could n't leave the baby . "  |p40The  coffee was much too hot . It was scalding his lips . He put it down abruptly , so that it clattered on the counter , and grabbed some butter out of the refrigerator . " What , what , " she was asking , " what happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smearing the butter overhis aching lips , until the soft cool grease had relieved the pain . " It 's almost daylight , " he said . " We 'll feel better when itgets light . " He sat down on one of the stools at the counter and waited . It would be a while yet . Though he did n't want to , he began thinking . At first he pushed the thoughts away , but then he stopped and let them come . I did n't even see him , not real clear . But I pulled the trigger , and I meant to kill . He 'd been in my house , and my wife was screaming , and I was mad . He should n't have been in my house .. . " You had a right , " his wife said , " you had a perfect right . " She could almost read his mind . Almost , but not quite . It was a question of the cost .. . " You were protecting your home , " his wife said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was his father 's word for it . When he gave him the gun . I ought to call him and tell him , he thought . He 'd started for the phone when he changed his mind . He was a grown man and he did n't go calling up his daddy . His wife was looking at him ; her face , already thin and pale from the baby , was more gaunt and blue-tinged than usual . He pulled his lips into a smile . " It 's all right , honey . Maybe we can even go back to sleep for a while . " And he sat back down at the counter , hooking his legs around the stool 's chrome legs . He stared out the window pretendinghe could see something more than the reflection of his own face.  |p41The  telegram was in the middle of the dining room table . It was leaning against the cut-glass bowl that sometimes held oranges , only this week nobody had bought any . There was just the empty bowl , lightly dust coated and flecked with orange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to put it there ? " Susan asked her mother . " It 's nothing to be ashamed of , " her mother said . " I 'm not ashamed , " she said , " but why did you put it there ? " " It 's something to be proud of . " " It looks just like a sign . " " People will want to see it , " her mother said . " Yes , " Susan said , " I guess they will . " She took her time dressing , deliberately . Twice her mother called up the stairs , " Susan , hurry . I told people any time after three o'clock . " And they were prompt , some of them anyway . ( How many had her mother asked ? She 'd been such a long time on the phone this morning . . . ) Susan heard them come , heard their voices echo in the high-ceilinged hall , heard the boards creak with unaccustomed weight . She could follow theirp42movements in the sounds of the old boards . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew that the women had stayed inside and the men had moved to the porches . Wide porches ran completely around two sides of the house , south and west . " Porches are best in old houses like this , " her mother often said . " Good , useful porches . " The west porch was the morning porch . Its deep overhangkept off the sun even in these July afternoons . There was a little fringe of moonflower vine too , across the eaves , like lace on a doily . The big white moonflowers opened each night like white stars and each morning , like squashed bugs , dropped to the ground . They were trained so carefully on little concealed wires up there that they never once littered the porch . . . The south porch was the winter porch . The slanted winter sun always reached that side , bare and clear , no vines , no planting . A porch for old people . Where the winter sun could warm their thin blood , and send it pumping through knotty blue veins . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all one winter . Every good day , every afternoon until she died .. . Susan always thought one porch was much bigger until she measured them  --  carefully , on hands and knees , with a tape measure . How funny , she thought ; they seemed so differentto be just the same . On this particular afternoon , as Susan came downstairs  --  slowly , reluctantly , hesitating at each step  --  she glanced toward the sound of men 's voices on the south porch . Looking through the screen into the light , she saw no faces , just the glaring dazzle of white shirts . She heard the little rattle of ice in their glasses and she smelled the faint musty sweet odor of bourbon . Like a wake , she thought . Exactly like a wake . Her mother called : " In the dining room , dear . " There was coffee on the table , and an ice bucket and a bottle of sherry and two bottles of bourbon . " Come in , Susan , " her mother said . " The girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Susan thought . They had to be first , herp43mother 's best friends , Mrs. Benson and Mrs. Watkins , each holding a sherry glass . Each kissed her , each with a puff of faint flower scent from the folds of their flowered dresses . " We are so sorry , Susan , " they said one after the other . Susan started to say thank you and then decided to say nothing . Mrs. Benson peered over her sherry glass at the telegram propped on the table next to the good silver coffeepot . " I thought the Defense Department sent them , " she said , " that 's what I always heard . " Susan 's mother said emphatically , her light voice straining over the words , just the way it always did : " They sent me one for my husband . " " That 's right . " Mrs. Watkins nodded . " I saw it just now when I came in . Right under the steps in the hall . In that little gold frame . " " When I read that telegram @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pain in my heart that I never got rid of . I carried that pain in my heart from that day to this . " And Susan said , patiently explaining : " The army told Harold 's parents . " " And the Carters sent word to you , " her mother said firmly . Her hand with its broad wedding band flapped in the air . " There on the table , that 's the word they sent . " All of a sudden Susan 's black dress was too hot and too tight . She was perspiring all over it . She would ruin it , and it was her good dress . " I 'm so hot , " she said . " I 've got to change to something lighter . " Her mother followed her upstairs . " You 're upset , " she said , " but you 've got to control yourself . " " The way you controlled yourself , " Susan said . " You 're mocking now , but that 's what I mean , I had to control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've nothing to control , " Susan said . She stripped off the black dress . The wet fabric stuck and she jerked it free . Close to her ear , a couple of threads gave a little screeching rip . " I 've got to find something lighter . It 's god-awfully hot down there . " " White , " her mother said . " White would be correct . " Susan looked at her , shrugged , and took a white pique out of the closet . " Are you all right ? " " I 'm fine , " Susan said , " I 'm great . " She put the white pique dress across a chair and sat down on her bed . Its springs squeaked gently . She stretched out and stared up at the crocheted tester and felt her sweat-moistened skin turn cool in the air . She pulled her slip and her bra down to her waist and lay perfectly still . Abruptly she thought : If there were a camera right over me , it would take a picture of five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my navel , and the two on my breasts . Five eyes staring up at the ceiling . She rolled over on her stomach . It was a foolish thing to think . Very foolish . She never seemed to have the proper thoughts or feelings . Her mother now , she had the right thoughts , everybody knew they were right . But Susan did n't .. . Like now . She ought to be more upset now . She ought to be in tears over the telegram . She 'd found it stuck in the crack of the door this morning . " Have been informed Harold was killed at Quang Tri last Thursday . " She should have felt something . When her- mother got the news of her father 's death in Korea , the neighbors said you could hear her scream for a block ; they found her huddled on the floor , stretched out flat and small as she could be with the bulging womb that held an almost completed baby named Susan . Susan lifted her head and looked at the picture on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her father , the same one her mother had painted into a portrait to hang over the living room fireplace . Susan used to spend hours staring into that small frame , trying to sharpen the fuzzy colored lines into the shape of a man . She 'd never been quite able to do that ; the only definite thing she knew about him was the sharp white lines of his grave marker in Arlington . " That picture looks just exactly like him , " her mother would say . " I almost think he 'll speak to me . I 'm so glad you can know what your father looked like . " And Susan never said : I still do n't know . I never will . And this whole thing now , her mourning for Harold , it was wrong . All wrong . She had n't even known him very well . He was just a nice boy from school , a tall thin boy who worked in the A &; P on Saturdays and liked to play pool on Sundays , who had a clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glee club . His father worked for the telephone company and they lived on the other side of town on MillwoodStreet  --  she knew that much . He 'd finished high school a year ago and he 'd asked her to his senior prom , though she had n't expected him to . On the way home , he offered her his class ring . " You can take it , " he said . She could see his long narrow head in the light from the porch . " Till I get out of the army . " " Or some other girl wants it . " " Yeah . " Because she could n't think of anything else , she said : " Okay , I 'll keep it for you . If you want it , just write and I 'll send it to you . " That was how she got the ring . She never wore it , and he did n't ask for it back . She did n't even see him again . His family moved away to the north part of the state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaves . He did n't come back to town and he did n't call her . He did send a chain to wear thep46ring on  --  it was far too big for her finger  --  from California . She wrote him a thank-you note the very same day . But he did n't answer , and the ring and the chain hung on the back of her dresser mirror . He was just a boy she knew who went in the army . He was just a boy whose ring she was keeping . Maybe he 'd told his parents something more . Why else would they wire her ? And what had he told them ? All of a sudden there were things she could n't ask . The world had changed while she was n't looking . And Harold Carter was killed . Harold was the name of an English king , and he was killed somewhere too . Now there was another Harold dead . How many had there been in between ? Thousands of Harolds , thousands of different battles .. . Her mother opened the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wall . The dresser mirror shivered and the class ring swung gently on its chain . " Susan , I thought , I just thought of something ... " What , Susan asked silently . Did you forget the extra ice ? Something like that ? Will people have to have warm drinks ? " You 're acting very strangely . I 've never seen you act like this . . . Did something go on that should n't have ? Tell me . " Susan tossed a hairbrush from hand to hand . " Maybe it 's me , " she said , " but I just do n't know what people are talking about any more . " " All right , " her mother said , " you make me put it this way . Are you going to have a baby ? " Susan stared at the broken edges of the bristles , and she began to giggle . " Harold left a year ago , Mother . " " Oh , " her mother said , " oh oh oh . " And she backed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her words along the empty hall where there was nobody to hear them : " That was you who was pregnant . And it was another war . " She put on some more perfume ; her flushed skin burned at its touch . She glanced again at the photograph of her father.  |p47You  look kind of frozen there . But then I guess you really are . Frozen at twenty-three . Smile and crooked cap and all . And Susan remembered her grandmother sitting on the porch in the sun , eyes hooded like a bird 's , fingers like birds ' claws . Senility that came and went , like a shade going up and down . " He do n't look nothing like the pictures , " she said . She always called her dead son-in-law he , never used his name . " Never looked like that , not dead , not alive . " The one hand that was not paralyzed waved at an invisible fly . " Died and went to glory , that boy . Those pictures your mother likes , they 're pictures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glory . " The old woman was dead now too . There were n't any pictures of her . She 'd gone on so long she fell apart , inch by inch of skin . All the dissolution visible outside the grave . . . Susan breathed on the glass front of her father 's picture and polished it with the hem of her slip . The young glorious dead .. . like Harold . Only she did n't have a picture of Harold . And she did n't really remember what he looked like . She could hear the creak of cane rockers on the porch , the soft mumbling of men 's talk . She stood by the screen to listen . " I 'll tell you . " Harry Benson , the druggist , was sitting in the big chair , the one with the fancy scrolled back . " They called us an amphibious unit and put us ashore and they forgotabout us . Two weeks with nothing to do but keep alive on that beach . " That would be Okinawa . She had heard about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the guys got nervous . If they found a Jap still alive they 'd work him over good , shoot him seven or eight times , just to see him jump . They kind of thought it was fun , I guess . " " Hold it a minute , Harry , " Ed Watkins , who was the railroad agent , said . " Here 's Susan . " They both stood up . They 'd never done that before.  | " We were talking about our wars , honey , " Mr. Benson said . " I 'm afraid we were . " " That 's all right , " Susan said . " I do n't mind . " " It was crazy , plain crazy , " Mr. Watkins said . " Like that guy , must have been ' 51 or ' 52 . " " Ed , look , " Mr. Benson said . " Maybe we ought to stop talking about this . " " Nothing so bad . . . This guy , I do n't think I ever knew his name , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you remember how they came down in waves from the North . You could hear them miles away , yelling and blowing horns . So , this time , you could hear them like always , and this guy , the one I did n't know a name for , he puts a pistol right under his jaw and blows the top of his head off . The sergeant just looked at him , and all he can say is , Jesus Christ , that son of a bitch bled all over my gun . ' " " Hard to believe things like that now , " Mr. Benson said . " I believe them , " Susan said . " Excuse me , I have something to do in the kitchen . " She had to pass through the dining room . Mrs. Benson still had a sherry glass in her hand , her cheeks were getting flushed and her eyes were very bright . Mrs. Watkins had switched from sherry to whiskey and was putting more ice in her highball . Susan 's mother poured herself coffee . Susan thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hangover and Mrs. Watkins ' ulcer is going to start hurting from the whiskey and my mother 's drunk about twenty cups of coffee today and that 's going to make her sick .. . She only said , " I 'm just passing through . " But she found herself stopping to look at the telegram . At the shape of the letters and the way they went on the page . At the way it was signed : " Mr. and Mrs. Carter . " She thought again how strange that was . They were both big hearty people  --  " Call me Mike , " Mr. Carter said to all the kids . " We 're Mike and Ida here . " Now all of a sudden they were formal.  |p49Like  a wedding invitation , Susan thought suddenly . Only just the opposite . She reached out and touched the paper . It crackled slightly under her fingers . She went on rubbing her thumb across the almost smooth surface , watching the sweat of her skin begin to stain the yellow paper . A little stain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she kept at it . That was the end of Harold Carter , she thought . He ended in the crisp , crunchy feel of a piece of paper . A tall thin boy who 'd taken her to a dance and given her a ring that was too big for her . All that was left of him was a piece of paper . She 'd send the ring back to his parents . Maybe they 'd like to have it . Or maybe they 'd rather she kept it . But keeping it would be keeping him . All of a sudden she saw the ring hanging on the side of her dresser mirror , and she looked into its blue stone and way down in its synthetic depths she saw a tiny little Harold , germ-sized and far away . As she looked he winked out . She put the telegram down . " I really was just going to the kitchen . " " You 're not wearing your ring , " Mrs. Watkins said . " No , " she said , " no , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so upset . " Mrs. Benson sipped delicately atthe edge of the yellow sherry . " Just like your poor mother . " " I was n't married to him , " Susan said , " it 's different . " Her mother was standing next to her , hand on her shoulder . " You would have married him . " " No , " Susan said , " no , I do n't think so . " " Of course you would have . " Her mother was firm . " Why else would he have given you the ring ? " Susan started to say : Because he did n't have anybody else to give it to and he could n't give it to his mother . Her mother went on patting her shoulder . " We should be proud of them , Susan . Harold was a fine young man . "  |p50Was  he ? She did n't have the heart to say that aloud either . Did he shoot people to see them squirm ? Did he pull the trigger against his own head with fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her mother said . The two women murmured consent . Her mother would know ; her mother had lost a husband in a war , she would know . All the brave young men that die in their glory , Susan thought . And leave rings to girls they hardly knew , and pictureson mantels in houses where they never lived . Rings that do n't fit and pictures that do n't resemble them . " Harold was an English king , " she said aloud . " Yes , dear , " her mother said patiently . " That 's history . " Harold Carter did n't get to sit on porches and remember , the way Watkins and Benson were doing now . He had n't got to do anything , except go to high school and die . But then , you did n't really know that either , Susan thought . You really did n't know what he did out there , what memories he might have brought back inside his head . Mrs. Watkins repeated , " All the young men are so brave . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my father , and not Harold . They were n't brave , they just got caught . " In the silence she could hear the soft wheeze of their astonishedbreaths , and , as she turned , the creak of old boards under her heel . " They do n't die in glory . " The words came out sounding like her speech at the Senior Debating Society . " They just die dead . Anyway , I was on my way to fix a cup of tea . " Nobody followed her to the kitchen , just the little ribbon of sound from her high heels on the bare boards and the linoleum . She flipped on the fire under the kettle , decided it would take too long and began to heat some water in a pan . Her feet hurt ; she kicked off her shoes . The water warmed and she poured it over the instant tea . There were no lemons in the refrigerator ; she remembered suddenly that there were n't any oranges on the dining room table either , that today had been marketing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tea and tasted it . It was barely warm and nasty , salty almost . She 'd forgotten to rinse the dishes again . She would drink it anyway , while she made another proper cup . She put the flame back under the kettle . She pushed open the screen door and went out on the kitchen porch . It was very small , just wide enough for one person to pass between the railing and the garbage can that always stood there . She 'd often argued with her mother over that . " Put it in the yard , it just brings flies into the house . " " A clean can , " her mother said , " does not attract flies . " And the can stayed . She sat down on the railing , wondering if it would leave a stripe on her white dress . She decided she did n't care . She sipped the cold tea and stared out into the back yard , at the sweet peas growing along the wire fence , at the yellow painted boards on the house next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeing anything in particular , not thinking anything at all , when Mr. Benson came around the corner of the house . He walked across the back yard and stopped , finally , one foot on the bottom step . " You left the girls in quite a state back there , " he said . So they had rushed to the porch to tell the men . . . Susan did n't take her eyes off the sweet peas , the soft gentle colors of the sweet peas . " They get upset real easy . " " I reckon they do , " he said , " and they quiet down real easy too . " She began to swing her leg slowly . I should n't have left my shoes in the kitchen , she thought . I 'll ruin my stockings out here . " I take it he was n't even a very good friend of yours , " Mr. Benson said . " You 'd take it right . " Because that sounded rude , she added quickly : " Nobody understands that . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't be so hard to understand . " " It 's like a wake in there , and that 's silly . "  | " Well , " Mr. Benson said , " he was nineteen and maybe when it 's somebody that young , you do n't even have to know him to mourn after him . " " He was twenty . " Susan looked at Mr. Benson then , the short stocky man , with a fringe of black hair around his ears and a sweaty pink skull shining in the heat . His eyes , buried in folds of puffy skin , were small sharp points of blue . My father might have looked like that , she thought . " Twenty 's still pretty young , " he said . " This whole thing is my mother . The minute she saw the telegram all she could think of is how history is repeating itself . She 's called everybody , even people she does n't like . " " I know your mother , " Mr. Benson said . " And that dying in glory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , palms pressing the rough wood . " That 's all I ever hear . My mother knows those stories  --  the ones you were telling on the porch  --  she knows it 's awful and stupid and terrible . " " No , " Mr. Benson said , " it is n't awful . " He pulled a cigarette holder from his pocket and began to suck it . " I gave up smokingand this is all I got left . . . You 're wrong , child , but maybe the stories do n't say it clear enough . " Susan said slowly , " You talk about it all the time , any time . " He nodded slowly and the empty cigarette holder whistled in the hot afternoon air . " Because it was the most glorious thing ever happened to us . " " Too bad you ca n't tell Harold , " she said . " Take Harold now . " Mr. Benson 's voice was dull and monotonous , singsonging in the heat . " He did n't have to join up right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around here lately . " " He knew he was going to have to , that 's why . " " It do n't happen like that . " He blew through the cigarette holder again , then tapped it on his palm . " Always seemed to me like men have got to have their war . I had to havep53mine twenty-five years ago . When you 're in it maybe it 's different , but you got to go . Once you hear about it , you got to go to it . " " That does n't make any sense to me , " Susan said . " None . " " Even when you 're in it , you know that if you live , you 're going to remember it all the rest of your life . And you know that if there was another war and you were young enough , you 'd go again . " " That 's stupid , " Susan said . " Maybe . You forget places you 've been and you forget women you had , but you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave a shriek . He glanced up . " Sounds like your water is boiling . " " Yes , " she said , " I 'll see to it . " He nodded and walked away , leaving a light smell of bourbon behind him . He turned once , lifted his hands , palms up in a little shrugging gesture . She made her tea . As if she were obeying a set of rules . Things were beginning to feel less strange to her . Even the talk about Harold did n't seem as silly as it had . I 'm beginning not to mind , she thought , but it 's still all mixed up . He was the sort of boy I could have married , but I did n't even know him . And that 's lucky for me . Otherwise I might be like my mother . His being dead does n't really change anything for me . I 'll get married after a while to somebodyas good as him or even better .. . She drank her tea slowly ; she was sad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had died . He did n't leave a memory behind , he did n't leave anything . He was just gone and there was n't even a mark at the place where he had been . Her mother stood in the door . " Do you feel well enough to come back in , child ? " Susan chuckled , a quiet little self-contented chuckle . " Whatever is funny , child ? "  | " You 're having such a good time , Mother , you have n't had such a good time in ages . " " Well , really . " " You 're alive and I 'm alive and Harold 's not alive . " " That 's horrible . " " Sure . " She followed her mother across the waxed linoleum . " Wait , I 've got to put my shoes on . " There just is n't anything , she thought . I 'm sorry , Harold . I hope it was n't too bad and I hope it did n't hurt too much . You and my father . I bet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her shoes were on now and she straightened up . " Good-by , " she said in a very light whisper . " You poor bastard . " And she went inside to join the people.  |p55I  , Edward Milton Henley , was born eighty-eight years ago in the front bedroom of my family 's five-story townhouse . There was great jubilation among the Irish servants : it meant whiskey and extra money for all of them . My mother , who 'd borne a daughter six years previously , was reported to have whispered , " Thank God it 's a boy , I wo n't have to do that again . " Even my father must have been elated far beyond his usual stoical dignity . He promptly transferred to me ( three days after my birth and some months before my christening ) half of the family shares of railroad stock . It was a splendid gesture . Their celebrations completed , they left me to endure through the ten years of my childhood . In those days , our part of the city was a pleasant , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in islands in the cobblestoned streets , cool parks where wicker governess carts with their cargo of silent , velvet-dressed childrenrolled through the heavy greenness . At night policemen walked their beats , sticks echoing hollow through the properly empty streets . Our ways too were orderly and proper . Every May we closed the house and went to the country . My father moved top56his club ; he would come later , in August , to spend two months with us . My mother , the children , and an assortment of servantstook the train to our farm near Lancaster . The farm itself was prosperous and well run , its manager a thin , hard-faced German who rarely spoke to anyone . But our life in the summer had nothing to do with farming or with him . We lived in the Great House . So it was called : a huge , pretentious place ( built by my maternal grandfather ) , vaguely Palladian , with many gothic touches . Like the Great Lantern . It dangled from the arched dimness of the entrance hall  --  a huge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colored glass . Each dusk the house staff hung a series of kerosene lanterns within it . Light sprayed upward , like flower stalks from a vase . The glass panels threw down pools of green and red and blue light , a sifting of strange petals to the rugs below . Later , as the upper air heated , the lantern shivered , then swung in slow circles , while solemnly dressed people sat at my parents ' long dining table and ponderously ate their accustomeddinner . Later still , when the ladies had twittered their way upstairs with a rush and rustle of skirts , men 's laughtershook the dining room door and smoke from their cigars hung like banners from the eaves of the tin pagoda . I never tired , evening after evening , of watching the shimmeringdisplay of lights in the gloom . I 've remembered all these years , and at the strangest times . When my second wife Eleanor was dressed for the opera one evening : " My dear , you remind me of a chandelier . All those colored stones like flashing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was not impressed . I ca n't claim Eleanor as a mistake of my youth ; I was thirtytwowhen we married . She was plump even then , or so I seem to remember . At the end of a marriage it is difficult to recall the beginning . In ten years , oh , how she grew , how she puffed , how she threatened to fill my world . Her elaborate jewelry , reflecting her family 's garish taste , rested on flesh as soft asp57lard and very nearly the same color . The only piece I 'd ever given her , an extraordinary cat's-eye pendant , she often wore  --  poor soul , no doubt she thought to please me . But , alas , on her the stone lost its terrible animal gleam . It lay horizontally on her breasts , offered to me , the good husband , for all the world like a fried egg on a plate . But it was her arms that most disturbed me , those perfect rounds of skin , so soft , so delicate that even bracelets bruised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Guido O'Connor . Of course his name was n't Guido , it was probably something like James or Sean , but he would never tell me . He was twenty , dark-haired and green-eyed . He was short and slight , very hard and very angular . His arms were ropy with muscle , his legs distorted with sinew . He was exactly what I needed after ten years of drowning in Eleanor . Guido moved into the house as my valet , and Eleanor left in a rage . He was with me for less than a year , a foolish time for me . Men are not my taste at all , I 've had only three or four in my whole long life , and Guido certainly was the worst . He knew nothing about the care of clothes and did not choose to learn . Eventually I tired of badly pressed suits , muddy shoes . Even those muscular arms , hairless as a woman 's , no longer moved me greatly . Guido left . I saw him only once , some four or five years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job and he needed money . Since it was then the middle of the depression , I thought he was quite probably telling the truth , so I gave him the money . He was surly and insulting about taking it , but of course he did . All of that  --  all the two-legged annoyances who havepassed through my bed  --  was years away from the small boywho sat and watched cigar smoke curl around the hall lantern . I grew up alone , but I was n't an only child . There was myolder sister , Priscilla , who became a beautiful woman andmarried a well-mannered and very rich man from Chicago.  |p58They  did nothing unusual in their entire lives , except sail on the Titanic . And drown . My sister 's death affected me greatly . ( A selfish feeling , I am sure . ) The hand of God had struck close to me . I could smell the chilly ozone of eternity . I decided to strike back ; I fathered a child . A conventional thing to do , of course . Matter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basically conventional  --  it is a pleasure to discover something unknown and unsuspected in oneself . But I digress . If , as a child , I often forgot I had a sister , so my parents often forgot they had a son . When my father 's glance fell on me  --  when , say , he looked up from his croquet game ( he was a great player , starkly handsome in his white flannels )  --  he would frown slightly , as if he were having trouble identifying me . I look exactly like him , and that perhaps was the trouble . It must have been like seeing himself through the wrong end of a telescope . " Oh yes , " he would say finally with great effort , " it 's you , Edward Milton ... " He always used my full name . My mother , on the other hand , would call me only Edward . " Milton , " she said , " is such a dreadful name . If only your father had n't read Paradise Lost ' that year . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all . Though I often spent rainy afternoons searching through the house I never found his copy . Well , as good a reason for a name as any other . And I have kept it all these years . Occasionally , even , my cards have read E. Milton Henley . One brash young man in the American consulate in London actually called me Miltie . Though he was at least half my age , I swung my umbrella , hooked it around his neck , and gave a sharp tug . He hit his face on the desk in front of him . After people had stopped being frantic at the sight of a little blood , I explained to him that I could not tolerate disrespect to the name of a great poet . His lip was so swollen he could hardly disagree.  |p59In  my tenth year , I finally managed to attract my parents ' attention : I got very sick with brain fever . It was May . We were ready to leave for the country . My father had moved to his club , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was a compulsively good housekeeper . The house was almost closed , and we were already officiallyout of town : no one would call on us now . I , who had been feeling terrible for some time , simply collapsed . First my mother raged at the maids : in taking up the carpets , in packing our summer trunks , they had obviously released a noxious dust . Then she turned her attention to me ; she closed my windows tight , hung curtains across them so that no harmfulstreet airs could enter . The floor of my room was stripped of its rug and strewn with pine needles , fresh every other day , to dispel the dangerous miasma . Nothing worked . I got sicker and sicker . At times it seemed I was floating in the air , at other times I was swimming . But the air was pleasant and the sea was warm , and I did not care . I talked constantly , my words complete gibberish . " The gift of tongues , " my mother said . I can still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I suppose , in the midst of one of her religious revivals . She even brought my father to listen : " The gift of tongues ! " I do n't remember what he said . If he said anything . If indeed he remembered who the boy in the bed was . The doctors ( there were any number of them , they always arrived in pairs ) told my mother that I was dying . I heard them . That would be unthinkable today , but then  --  before the turn of the century  --  death was an expected thing . Children died , poor ones and rich ones , and they died of all sorts of different maladies . The only important thing was to prepare the soul for paradise . Therefore , because they were responsible men , the doctors announced my impending departure for eternity . I was n't upset . After all , one of my recurring dreams was of already being dead . And from fact to dream and back again did n't seem particularlyhorrible . As for my mother , perhaps she shed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do know what else she did . She called all the maids together and had them reopen the summer-stripped double parlors , wax the floors , put down the formal rugs , so the house would be ready for my wake . My room was over the parlors , I could hear the thumps of moving furniture , and my mother 's steady barrage of instructions . It was , oddly enough , rather comforting . Weeks later , when it was clear that I would live , the whole process was repeated in reverse . Thumps and thuds and constant commands meant that the funeral formality was coming up and summer mats and slip covers going down . In any case , thinking about my funeral had started my parentsthinking about my future . And so my education began . It started with three years in Paris , in the house of an ancient cousin and her equally ancient housekeeper , three years when my greatest excitement was watching balloons in the park . Finally , I caught a heavy February cold ; my cousin immediately diagnosed it as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite enough of me by then . I was growing up , and with her perennial visions of rape she was afraid to have a young male under her roof . After Switzerland came England , after England , Germany . I grew tall and attractive , at least so women told me . I drank and traveled , considered acquiring a dueling scar and decided against it . My best friend , a Berliner named Ernst , had such a mark . Though it was almost a year old , it was still a livercoloredstreak across his cheek . He was killed in 1915 , and I often wonder if his scar ever faded to the pale distinction he wanted so very much . I was in Europe , one place or the other , for some ten years . My sister was a very diligent correspondent ; she even visited me . My parents , I suspect , simply forgot about me again . My allowance and all my extra expenses were automatically handled by my father 's office . His letters sounded so completely unlike him that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ write a letter to my son " the first week of every month.  |p61My  mother wrote even less frequently , and her letters were mostly newspaper clippings . I suppose that was easier than thinking of something to say to a son you ca n't remember . ( Perhaps I am just easy to forget . I myself have had periods of difficulty remembering who I am . Not factually , of course . I could always recite my name and current address . But there have been times when I did not feel like my name . Times when it took an effort of will to wrap my identity around me , to put flesh on the bones , skin on the skull . ) When my father died , my mother actually forgot to cable me . Discreetly my sister notified me . Her letter arrived the day before her cable announcing our mother 's death ( she 'd survived her husband by only three weeks ) and asking me to come home . On the boat  --  the old Majestic , how clearly I remember  --  I met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name was Abigail and her father was " in cattle " in California . He had constant losses and was always badgering me for a loan . Still , Abigail and I stayed together for some ten years , no doubt out of mutual boredom . The one serious and finally fatal disagreementwe had was over my son . As I 've said , I produced him very shortly after my sister 's death . Though I 'd been married only a few years , I knew I wanted a child with no attachment to any of my wives  --  even then I could predict a series of them . I selected an Irish girl , of no importance whatever , and paid her very well for her trouble incubating my child . She seemed delighted with the whole arrangement . My only requirement was that she disappear completely , and so she did . I bought her ticket to Pittsburgh and I presume that is where she went . The boy I named Anthony and set up with nurses in my house , intending to adopt him at once . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the firm resolve of all very stupid people . The boy continued to live with me as my son in spite of his clouded legal status . My second wife , Eleanor , was delighted to cooperate . ( My wives are all most docile in the first three years of marriage ;  |p62after  that they become stubborn and opinionated . ) She was genuinely fond of the boy ; her maternal instincts were strong . She practically begged me to begin adoption proceedings . I did so the second day after our wedding . Anthony was a quiet , self-contained child , perhaps because of those early years spent with my first wife . She had never been abusive toward him , but she had hardly been cordial either . The child could scarcely not be affected , though I myself tried hard to amuse him . One year he was infatuated with horses , so I bought him four ponies , beautifully matched roans . He considered them gravely , said thank you properly and without any warmth . To this day I do n't know if he really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tenth birthday , Eleanor and I built a large greenhouse as a tropical jungle for two pet monkeys . Anthony was often there , watching , playing with them . But so carefully , so gravely . As if he were afraid of breaking a single flower or bruising a single leaf . My friends congratulated me on Anthony  --  I myself was never so sure . He was an excellent student , a calm , rational boy who refused to take part in prep-school athletics . " I can not agree with the concept of an all-around man , " he wrote me . " If I have only so much physical energy , I do not choose to dissipate it racing around a frozen muddy field . " His school , impressed perhaps by the fact that he was the first serious Greek scholar they had had in a hundred years , agreed with him . He wrote long letters to me  --  serious , well-reasoned discussionsof subjects that interested him . There were no personal details at all . Obviously he would never join me in business . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much a loner , in my way , as is Anthony . ) With his passion for classical languages , his quiet , studious ways , I assumed that he would settle into a dusty chair at some university . I was not prepared for the letter that announced , in his last year of college , that he was entering the Unitarian ministry.  |p63I  took the next train to Princeton , my arguments ready . I was not objecting to the ministry itself  --  as a matter of fact I am devoted to fancy Episcopalian services . " Anthony , " I said , " if you must hear the call , why do n't you hear it from a respectable church ? Does it have to be Uni-tarian ? " Anthony smiled and said nothing . Only a slight clouding of his dark eyes told me that I had offended him . I did not mean to . But would he know that ? In due course my son married and produced two children . A wretched number . I once told his wife that to have two childrenwas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  --  she insisted on calling me by that name . Once I objected and she said : Shall I call you Mr. Henley ? So Father it was for lack of anything else . English is a very limited language  --  " Father , we have two children because we can afford two children . " So it was simply a matter of money . I looked up my son 's income , the bits and pieces of things he had been given on birthdaysand Christmases in his childhood . It did not amount to very much . The salary from his church was even less . So I had my lawyers transfer a block of five thousand shares of Potomac Electric to my son . It would pay well enough , I thought , to add another child to his household . My gift went to them by messenger . And came back by messenger within a few hours . That was my son . And his wife . And their two children . I scarcely spoke to them for years afterward . I loathe that kind of righteousness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest . And a new woman . I was now a publisher of lavishly expensive art books ; I also supported an equally expensive and ambitious quarterly review called The Finer Arts  --  its title sprawled across the cover in a tricky Gothic script nobody could read . A very serious magazine , full of high purpose , it was just exactly like its editor , Helen Reed . We were together four or five years  --  I actually took an apartment in New York , actually moved there , I was that much in love . She was a hand/some woman , a little too tall for me , with thick gray hair pulled into a bun . A schoolteacher 's face , a pedant 's seriousness . I did not marry Helen ( she even kept her own apartment ) though I was fonder of her than I had ever been of my fourth wife , who was her immediate predecessor . With age one becomesmore wary , more eager to avoid trouble . After four attempts I simply stopped going through the farce of a marriage ceremony . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem to do . I really think she exhausted me into indifference . She herself lived at a high pitch of excitement , bounding breathlessly from interest to interest . I was overwhelmed . She left , in furious tears , one afternoon . She crammed her belongings ( how had she accumulated so many things here ? ) into three large suitcases , two of them mine . ( They were Vuitton , and I did not expect her to return them . She did not . ) I offered her my car and driver , she refused silently , turning her back on me . I therefore fixed myself a Scotch , kicked life into the living room fire , and began to enjoy the quiet . Half an hour later , crossing the room for my second drink , I happened to glance out the window and into the rather miserablestreet . There she was , at the curb , with her suitcases , waiting for a cab , pacing up and down impatiently . I began to work on my carving . It was a wooden figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dress . I had started it merely to annoy Helen . Now it was very nearly finished , except for the elaborate headgear . I was doing each feather with absoluteprecision ; I had little trouble with rachis and vane , but the fluff was very difficult indeed . After nearly an hour , my hand was tired . Helen was no longer at the curb . I opened the window and looked down the street : there she was , no more than a hundred feet away . The taxi had never come , she was dragging a suitcase in each hand , and kicking the third along in front of her . As I watched , she stopped the paper boy , who 'd finished his routep65and was on his way home . And so she found a way to exit with dignity , stalking behind a rattling newsboy 's wagon . I saw Helen again almost thirty years later . Someone introducedus ; I would not have recognized the hunched old woman . Perhaps she felt the same about me .. . My son is very fond of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war and peace , love and hate , life and death . He actually seems to take comfort in this instability . I may indeed have my seasons but I emphatically do not enjoy them . I prefer to think of my life as a pageant . Or a processional . Like that wonderful march in Aida in which once , as a boy , I was a costume extra . I would parade across the stage , race around the back , exchanging my spear for a banner , then across the stage again . At one point I even rode in a chariot , my armor hidden under a hastily wrapped toga , on my head a garland of paper leaves . Now in my old age many things seem more unreal to me than those costumed figures in Aida . A trick of the observer 's eye , no doubt , a senile astigmatism . A concession to my years , perhaps , but I am no longer active in business ; I now devote myself to philanthropy . It is , in its way , as amusing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son 's congregation ; with their financing problems I did n't think they would ever have one otherwise . Anthony was very nervous about it ; he did n't really approve , but he could n't think of a reasonable objection . ( I find it hard to believe that thin gray old man is my son . ) I added a small wing to the children 's hospitalhere . ( My son was equally nervous about that ; he does n't care to have me in what he regards as his territory . ) I am presentlydeciding upon the best way to endow a few neighborhood pediatric clinics.  |p66All  of it for children , you say ? Yes , I know . I am fond of youth . That is probably why , after almost six years , I still keep Roberta . She is thirty now , which to me is a veritable infant . Her skin still has the glow of young tissue , and she is quite beautiful . She is indeed worth every penny she costs me . And she is very expensive  --  her clothes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her young sister to college , then for two years to the Sorbonne . Did such a younger sister really exist ? I doubt it . Still I am amused by Roberta , and her flaming beauty  --  she is a true redhead  --  fits perfectly into my processional view of life . For some four years Roberta was my live-out mistress . I would often introduce her that way : it made her simply furious . She claimed it hurt her pride . Now , the very idea of Roberta with any pride is indescribably hilarious to me . Two years ago the role of my live-out mistress abruptly changed . I was unable to prevent it at that time . I had a coronary . One morning at my desk I had the most absurd feeling of not being able to breathe . I thought of heart  --  at my age who does n't  --  but there was no pain , no pain at all . Quite automatically I rang for my secretary . Equally automaticallyI put my pen back in its holder . And then I stopped breathing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember , I was ensnared in a tangle of wires and hissing valves and surrounded by busy white-coated people . And oh yes , Roberta was there , her frighteninghair pulled back into a bun , her face as free of make-up as any nun 's . Months later when I came home I found that she had moved into my house . For my sake , as she put it , she had sublet her apartment  --  furnished , of course  --  and had crammed all her most personal belongings into half the upstairs closets of my house . She had also taken over the bedroom next to mine , after doing a little work on it first  --  rug and bed were white fur , blue damask walls and curtains . Just a place to rest , she assured me , from the strenuous anxiety of caring for me.  |p67She  was , as a matter of fact , a very good housekeeper . She got on well with the three shifts of nurses , though they were all absolute harridans . She charmed my fretful , suspicious cook , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways to be gently amusing and totally delightful to me . It was in many ways her best performance . ( I sometimes think that Roberta , like me , sees her life as a series of pageants . This was her DomesticIdyll . ) I recovered completely , though it was almost six months before I felt like moving about freely . First I discharged those white-capped witches who had so completely controlled me . Then I set about returning Roberta to her proper place . One Wednesday she went shopping , promising to be gone all afternoon . She was , of course , meeting a man ; I applauded silently : her true shopping expeditions left me only a mountain of bills . This way was far better . While she was gone , I mobilized the house staff , very much the way my mother had done for my funeral so long ago . We , helped by the two strong Polish dailies , packed all of Roberta 's things into large brown boxes , carried them down the front stairs , through the kitchen , past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the small wing behind the second summer kitchen . It was originally the servants ' wing , but since I do not keep that sort of staff any more , the four small rooms were empty and waiting . The two dailies chose the very first room  --  the boxes were heavy and awkward , and they were tired of carrying . ( The butler , the cook , and I , being almost equally dottery and ancient , were of very little help . ) We hung some clothes in the small closets , but most we left jumbled in the boxes . It was just too difficult to unpack her completely . I myself brought the flowers from her other room  --  a big sprig of purple California lilac . I knew she was very fond of it . I simply removed it from its blue vase ( eighteenth-century Japanese , and very valuable ) and put it in a more suitable container . In this case , a Mason jar . She threatened to leave . How noisy she was , how that redp68hair flashed back and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coronary , I ignored her . And she stayed . Of course , I know that she is now looking for another spot , that she will eventually go . I shall miss her too . She is so very decorative . But I shall not miss her as much as I might once have done . I think perhaps I have finally grown tired of women and their ways . At last . And I certainly have grown very fond of my great-grandchildren . ( My son 's two children have each producedtwo children : I am haunted by that absurd number . ) They are as curious about me as I about them  --  and I always censor the story of my life for their hearing . The Reverend Anthony Henley , who ought to have been at work on Sunday 's sermon , was staring idly out the window . There , in the violent green of the new spring , under a Bristolbluesky , his father sat on the arbor swing , talking to the children . The grape vines had not yet leafed out ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair . He had , the ReverendHenley noticed , let his hair grow quite long , well past his ears . He has thicker hair than I do , the Reverend Henley thought wearily . Forgetting the sermon , he went on looking out the window . He had never , he thought , seen the garden so pretty . It was a very ordinary plot of ground , just a few rhododendrons and the scattered tulips that his wife insisted on planting every year . Now it seemed dramatic , unreal  --  the gleam of his father 's hair , the children 's upturned faces , their complete immobility . Even the youngest boy was perfectly still . I have seen that picture before , the Reverend Henley thought . His practiced mind worked backward , sorting through memories , until he found it : an illustration in a book of Bible stories he 'd used years ago in Sunday school . . . the sort of maudlin illustration he had always disliked . The sort you didn'tp69find in textbooks any more . . . And who ? Some patriarch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowly , contemplatinghis study walls . Each book had its proper place , and he knew them all . Nothing was ever moved , nothing changed , the chairs fitted the holes they had worn years ago in the carpet . But even here his father 's presence disturbed him . Not a lack of understanding . The Reverend Henley imaginedhe understood his father quite well . . . No , it was n't that . It was an uneasiness , a growing suspicion that his father had succeeded where he had failed , that his father understood many things in a way denied to him . . . Such perfect and unconcerned assurance the old man had . It was disquieting . He who had spent his life in pursuit of understanding , who was on familiar terms with the accumulated wisdom of five thousand years of human existence . . . why should he be troubled , why should he feel diffident and uncertain in the presence of a man whose life had been devoted to the irrational , to the pursuit of instant pleasure and selfish whims ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if truth lies beyond fulfillment of desire , in satiated appetite .. . He leaped from his chair , his back aching with the violent motion . No . Absolutely no . Furtively he glanced out the window into the garden . His father was getting up . The two biggest children stood behind the swing , steadying it . The littlest waited in front , holding ready his cane . Then , children following closely , the old man strolled across the small green skirt of garden grass . He saw his son at the window and lifted his hand in a slow careful greeting . It was , the Reverend Henley thought with a shudder , altogetherlike a blessing.  |p701  he bright blue jeep left the main road and plowed its way over the dunes , snow tires spinning out sand like a wake behind . Twenty minutes later it skidded sidewise down the last slope and stopped on the hard-packed sand of the beach . Three young men got out , took out three shovels and a bright yellow-and-black-plaid cooler . And the jeep roared back the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The three young men jammed their shovels in the sand , sat down , backs to the towering dune , and each had a can of beer . They filled the cans with small pebbles and tossed them out into the ocean , beyond the ruffled line where the surf was breaking . Finally they took off their shirts and began to dig the pit . When it was knee deep , they collected round stones and lined the pit carefully with them . Then they sat back and had another beer . The bright blue jeep skittered down the dune again . This time it held five girls , several paper bags , three damp sacks , and a large wooden crate . Two of the young men carried the crate into the ocean , stepping carefully over the stony bottom , makingtheir way to a pool the falling tide had left . They put the crate there , in the knee-deep water , and weighted its top with rocks . The others collected driftwood and began a fire in thep71stone-lined pit . Then they spread their blankets and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some of them went swimming , picking their way carefully through the fallen boulders . And some merely stretched out in the last of the sun . It was slipping rapidly over the edge of the dunes , and the shadows of the eel grass and the beach peas edged farther and farther down the slope . Frieda Matthews decided to go for a walk . She was already badly sunburned , and lying on the flat hot sand made her body itch and tingle all over . She switched off her green transistor radio and put it carefully in the middle of her towel . It had been a present from her family , not six weeks ago . It was a good radio , an expensive one , a Zenith , far more than her family could afford with her brother Everett already in college and wanting to go to medical school , and her own collegebills still to come . She walked down to the edge of the water , and stared out beyond the rocks to the open Atlantic . The swimmers were there , splashing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw her brother 's head , sleek and dark as a seal 's . " Hi , Everett ! " He yelled : " Come on in ! " She waved and strolled off down the beach . She was afraid of the ocean . It had something to do with the dark color , with the sound and the motion of the surf . She swam well and happily in pools  --  the clean green and white tile was friendly and sparkling . But the unknown opaque distances of the ocean . . . no . She walked toward the west , following the line of high tide , searching among the sea wrack . She found a string of whelk egg cases , wrinkled and joined like cardboard . With her fingernail she cut through the thick horny casing of one compartment and a dozen tiny shells spilled into her hand . She found a sprig of Irish moss , perfect and white , and she tucked it into her shirt as a boutonniere . ( There was something her grandmother hadp72made  --  in the old-fashioned kitchen of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same ruffled white seaweed . ) She found a lobster pot marker , striped in its owner 's colors . She did not recognize them . The marker must have drifted a long way , from some part of the coast to the south  --  the currents were that way  --  where she did not know the symbols . She tossed it aside , annoyed . Feeling just the way she had when , as a child , she found a floating bottle and a message too blurred to read . Frieda picked up the marker again anyway and carried it with her as she scrambled along a rocky spit that jutted out into the ocean , dividing the coast into two shallow coves . There seemed to be a picnic in the second cove too . She was surprised ; this stretch of coast was so difficult to reach that few people ever came . But there they were , two jeeps standing side by side . As she , watched , three men struggled into their shiny black skin-diving suits and backed gingerly into the surf , holding their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they would be snorkeling close inshore . A cluster of women waited on the beach . With the wind in her face Frieda could hear the sound of their laughter . A half-grown boy was climbing the highest dune , sliding and scrambling in the loose sand . Two small childrenran up and down in the slip of the ocean , splashing and screaming . It was then about five o'clock , midway in a falling tide . The sun went down , the light lingered , then faded . The blue jeep made its final trips , and the beach party really began . There was a guitar now , and a second bonfire , and a washtub full of beer cans . The swimmers had come in long ago  --  about the time Frieda returned from her walk  --  and gotten dressed . The wind had dropped , and so had the surf . The ocean slipped quietly down into the low of the spring tides . A couple of the young men were working on the pit . They dragged out the remains of the burning wood and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of rockweed and shook the shiny black strands down into the pit . " Ca n't I do something ? " Frieda asked . Everett said , " Help me wet the corn . " They carried the sack of corn down to the edge of the water . She felt it swirl cold around her ankles . " Do n't dip it here , " Everett said . " Too much sand . " She looked at the dark water . " You know I ca n't . " " Oh for God 's sake ! " He pulled the corn away from her , and she retreated to the dry sand . He came back in a minute , dripping sack on his shoulder . " Thanks to you I got my shirt wet . " She spread out her hands , miserably . " Everett , you know that ... " He walked away , to the pit . A dark girl with crispy curly black hair helped him slide the sack from his shoulder . As she bent to look inside he nibbled the nape of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked away . I should n't have come , Frieda thought . And she remembered : Everett , her mother said , you have simply got to see that Frieda makes some friends . Four summers at camp and she does n't know a soul around here any more . Okay , he said , I 'll take her to the beach party . She 's too young and it wo n't work . But okay . Now Everett looked over at her , his face streaming sweat from the heat of the pit . " Where 's your date , little sister ? " he asked . A tall thin boy who was in prep school somewhere and whose name was John . . . Everett had arranged it . " I do n't know , " Frieda said . " Looks like he 's standing right behind you . " Frieda spun around . " You do n't have to jump out of your skin , " John said . " Oh , " she said . " Oh . Have n't seen you for ages . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing ? " " Nothing , " she said uncertainly . " Nothing much . "  | " I saw you go running off down the beach . " " I was watching some skin divers over there . " " No ! " Exaggerated unbelief . " Do n't be silly . Of course I did . " " Okay . We 'll just go and have a look . " Hand on wrist , he pulled her along . She hung back , but he only squeezed tighter until little prickles of pain ran up and down her arm . Then she gave up , and with a couple of quick hops , came into step with him . " Just to the point , " she said . " Then you can see . " They looked . Even in the faint light they could see that the group was gone  --  the dogs and the children and the women . There was only a single boy sitting by a heap of towels and clothes . He was writing in the smooth hard sand . " Okay , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . " " Let 's go back . " " That shaky little girl voice . . . Will you please stop being scared of me ? " " I 'm not , " she said . " For God 's sake , " he said , " I 'm not going to rape you . I 'm not even going to kiss you . " " I do n't know what you are thinking , " she said as formally as she could . " I may be the youngest person at this party , but I am not a child and I am not all that naive . " " I 'm going to go get a beer , " he said . And she had to admit that during the slow walk back across the sand the pressure of his hand on her wrist was not at all unpleasant . The guitar player was standing up . " Seeger does it like this . " He rattled off a bit of song . " And if I had a banjo I 'd show you the way Scuggs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's terrific , great . " Frieda noticed all of a sudden that he had a goatee  --  it wasp75so very blond that she had n't even seen it before . In the soft light from the bonfire , it gleamed with sudden brightness . " Look what 's coming , " the guitar player said , waggling his shiny tuft of whiskers . " Lookee there . " Two young men carried the lobsters from the surf , staggeringunder the awkward crate , leaving a trail of water like blood on the sand behind them . They tumbled the crate to the edge of the pit , opened it . ( Frieda saw that Everett was one of them . Strange , she thought , I almost did n't recognize him . He looks different . ) They began pulling the lobsters out and dropping them on the steaming seaweed . John came back , beer can in hand . " Do you know that there 's a superstition that lobsters scream when you put them in boiling water ? " Frieda felt the back of her throat close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , half a dozen times , only I do n't know how she could have because they do n't have any vocal cords , you see . But there are lots of people who say they 've heard it . " Frieda turned away , found a sheltering dune , and settled herself . there , back to the fire . John followed her , dropped down beside her . " That bothers you , does n't it ? But it 's a fact . " " I wo n't swim in the ocean either , " she said stubbornly , " and that 's just as much a fact . " " You 'll be all right when you grow up , " he said . " Want a swallow of my beer ? " She accepted the can , silently . The cool liquid ran over her aching throat . He turned to watch the party . " They 've put the tarpaulin on , and the sand on top , so if you want to go back it 's all right . " " I think I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , and she saw that he had misunderstood her answer . But she did n't feel that it mattered any more . His jacket smelled of sweat and the steel of the zipperp76pressed into her cheek , but even so it was better than being alone . Even so . Frieda lifted her head . " I hear something , " she said . " Something'sgoing on . " She had become aware of it gradually , imperceptibly , as the noise became louder . It seemed to have begun on the opposite side of the fire , a considerable distance away . " Look there , " she told John . People seemed to be drifting away , the way sugar runs out of a paper , gently , quickly . " What 's happening ? " John shook his head . " Want to go see ? " By then everyone seemed to be running down the beach , toward that rocky point . Except one  --  a boy who sat by the fire . " Who 's that ? " Frieda asked . " I never saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Frieda called , " what 's the matter ? " He sat very quietly , did n't answer , did n't blink , just stared into the colored flames on the driftwood , as if he had n't heard , really . John said : " Let 's go see . " The group had come to a stop and was milling around at the tip of the beach . Frieda found Everett and grabbed his arm , firmly . " Everett , " she said , " do you know what 's going on ? " He started to pull away , then stopped . " My little sister , for God 's sake . . . did you see the boy , or were you too busy making out with John ? " " The boy by the fire ? " " Well , he turned up , asking us to help . " Everett rubbed his chin , nervously . " He said that a diver did n't come back . " Frieda noticed that the full moon had swung itself over the horizon 's rim , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the unexpected shiny rocks . " We saw them , " she said , " earlier . There were three or four divers and some children . "  |p77Everett  said : " The way he told it to us , his brother went back for one more try while the others went home and he stayed to keep him company . " Everett shrugged . " I guess we go look for him now . " Frieda said , " Somebody ought to go for help . Like the fire department or something . " " Somebody went . " Somebody lit two bright gas lanterns . Somebody brought all the flashlights . Somebody figured the shorewise drift . And one by one they waded in to begin the hunt . John let go of Frieda 's hand , and in the sudden sweep of cool air across it , she realized that he had been holding it for quite a long time . " Well , " he said , to the rising moon as much as to anyone else , " I guess I 'll go look too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at her . " What we were doing was more fun . Keep my place , huh ? " He slipped off his jacket and handed it to her . " Watch it . There 's some money in the pockets . " He put one foot in the water . " Jesus , it 's cold . " He hitched up the belt of his plaid trunks and squinted down , shrugging . " Well , I might step on him , but I 'll never see him . " Frieda held the jacket carefully . " I should think you could see the color of his skin . Kind of white like . " " Honey baby , " John said , " he 'd be wearing a black rubber suit . . . Do n't spill my money . " He waded out , and Frieda went back up the beach , rolling the jacket carefully , pockets inside . Maybe I could go in just a little , and help , she thought . But even she did not believe it . Then she remembered the boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll go back and keep him company , she told herself . I can do that . She walked toward him briskly . He was sitting just exactly the way he had been when she last saw him . Knees up . Arms wrapped around them . He must be the boy , she thought , whop78was climbing up the back dune when I first saw them , when the sun was still out . " Can I get you something ? " she said . He was wearing only a T-shirt , and she put a hand on his shoulder . Through the thin knit she felt the icy coldness of his skin , bone deep . " Can I get you a coat ? " He did not answer , but she hunted until she found an extra jacket that somebody had dropped . And she put it around his shoulders . He did not move  --  not even his eyes . They stared steadily at the tips of his white sneakers . She gave up and wandered down the beach to watch the search . Most of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The young men were farther out , barely inside the surf line . Their lights reflected off the broken surfaces of the scattered black rocks . As she looked , one was caught by a surf and rolled . He came up cursing , his flash still burning . Like a horde of flounder fishermen , Frieda thought . All that was missing were the gigs .. . All but one of the flashlights were out ; the moon had slipped a couple of inches up in the sky ; all but a few searchers had come ashore and were standing by the fire , shivering , when a changing tide brought him to them . A muffled shout : " Here , hey ! " And one of the gas lanterns swung in a signaling arc . The other lantern and the single remainingflashlight moved quickly to the same spot . Two young men left the warmth of the beach and ran out again . A few more shouts and they began their trip in , dragging something through the waist-deep water . They got past the largest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single heavy surf caught them . The lanterns went over , flooded , and disappeared . In the sudden dark the men tumbled into the rocks , dragged and rolled by the undertow . Three held on ; they struggled to their feet , and , lifting their burden , scrambled the rest of the way . They carried him up the wet tide beach to the dry sand , black flippers dragging like a fish 's tail behind . They left himp79there  --  left him to the others who crowded around  --  and hurried to the fire , their wet bodies huddled against the cold night wind . They found towels and scrubbed furiously at their bodies , jigging up and down for warmth . They coughed and slapped each other 's back . They gulped cans of beer because their mouths tasted of salt , their stomachs were numb and their throats tight . " Damned if I saw it coming , " they told each other . " First I knew was the crest coming over . " Everett , who 'd been crouched over coughing , straightened up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blood was running down the side of his jaw . He touched his ear gingerly , sucked in his breath with pain . " Jesus , all of that for a guy that 's already dead . We got to be crazy . " " I think maybe I broke my hand , " somebody said . " How do you know when you break your hand ? " " You sure he 's dead ? " " Never felt anything heavier . " " Where 's that kid ? He still around ? " The boy was watching them . His eyes had lifted from the tips of his sneakers , he was watching them directly . He was sitting up quite straight and the borrowed jacket had slipped off his shoulders . He was looking right at them , and he was listening to every word . Frieda did not remember too much about the rest of it . They tried to revive him , using the only method they knew , mouthto-mouthbreathing . John had been the first . When he was finished , he walked a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then he kicked sand over the spot , washed his face , and scooped up a couple of handfuls of sea water into his mouth . When he turned , Frieda was holding a beach towel for him . " Come to the fire , " she said . " It 'll make you feel better . " " Find me a beer , " he said . Then as an afterthought , he added , " It 's the idea mostly . " He was still scrubbing his fingers across his lips when Friedap80held out the beer to him . " It was better when I was kissing you , " he joked feebly . She sat close by him , waiting to see what else he needed . Once she put her arm across his shoulder , but he pulled away . " I 'm okay . " And when he finished the beer , he got up himself and got another . So there was nothing for her to do . She took her own jacket and climbed far up the nearest dune , twenty feet to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the smooth whiteness , felt herself twitch and die under the moon , sucked and brittle like a shell . No one noticed that she was gone . Everett would now be nursing his bloody ear . John would be crouched by the fire fighting down his nausea . And that unnamed boy would be sitting and waiting , staring at nothing . As she watched , a police van came roaring and skidding along the beach . Two deputies popped out , almost before it stopped moving . They waded into the small crowd of people , like a pool of water , sending the individual drops flying off to the side . They lifted the black form  --  in the bright moonlight Frieda could see smears of sand on the rubber suit . Just before the door slammed Frieda caught sight of one deputy busily slipping something into the slack mouth on the floor . Frieda lay back on her sand bed and forgot all about the scuffling and the crisscrossing pattern of headlights below her . There was nothing she could do . There was nothing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moon-faded stars and began to count them carefully . She had gotten to fifteen before she lost her place and had to start over . When she did bother to look down again , the cars were gone . And the people . The bonfire had been covered with sand . The pit was still banked and unopened , and there was a tiny bit of steam rising from one corner , brisk and frosty in the moonlight  |p81They  forgot me , she thought . But then I was n't really there , was I ? She slid down from her dune . And stood on the level sand , scuffed by rushing feet and the deep treads of snow tires . She saw the dark mark on the sand where the diver had lain . She wondered why that did not bother her more , but it seemed no more horrible than everything else . Than the lobsters  --  screaming or silent  --  still steaming in the pit . Than the surf grinding the chitinous bodies of uncounted animals to bits on the shingle . Than the sharp smell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of another body . Standing alone on the trampled , littered sand , she talked to herself , silently . I wish that boy had n't heard their talk . . . But of course he sat so still that you did n't really notice him . . . But he still did n't have to hear it . Not like that . She wished that the boy had listened to her . She wished she 'd been able to put her arms around him and tell him gently . But , in the empty hollow of the dunes , after a while , she realized how useless it was , that the surge of protection was just a part of her sex . As natural as her ovulation . And as useless as the ova which had ripened and decayed for these eight years past in her own body . She noticed that the moon was high and white in the sky now . The tide had come in ; the spume from its breakers drifted over the dunes like fog . The ocean itself was black and still , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember her and they would come back for her . All she had to do was wait . And that was what she could n't do . No . She could n't wait for them . She wanted to run , but she did not allow herself to . She saw that her radio still lay on her beach towel , which was still spread out carefully . She walked over to it . There was sand blown or trampled across the towel , sand frosting the top of the radio.  |p82She  picked it up , blew it clean , and turned it on . It worked . Then she picked up the towel , shook it , folded it carefully . She put her back to the ocean and began to think of the long walk ahead of her . She would have to find a path through the poison ivy and the spiny clumps of rugosa roses . It would be slow going in the sand until she reached the road , and from there it was three or four miles home . Unless she met someone , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She put her towel across her left shoulder , and her radio in her left hand . And she began her walk . The sound of her radio was a small mark in the sea-beaten dark , but she was grateful for it , and she moved along confidently , safe inside its tinny shell.  |p83Because  she was very glad to have him back , she asked no questions . No questions at all . She did n't think he 'd answer anyway . He was so moody these days . Quick to take offense , silent for long stretches of time . So changed that sometimes she wondered if this were really the same man  --  until , in his brief flashing smile , she recognized the husband she 'd loved . When he was alive . Perhaps apparitions ( she hesitated at the word ghost  --  no , not Jerry ) were like that . Perhaps . . . She spent one long day in the university library , a day when she ought to have been finishing her economics term paper , searching for an answer . Methodically she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready to leap from her head and her very fingers ached . Apparitions , she learned , had messages . But Jerry did not seem to want to talk . Indeed he rarely glanced in her direction . It was she who stared at him ... Apparitions , the books also said , were restless . Jerry spent most of his time in the big chair in the living room , as comfortably as any man come home from work . . . Apparitions returned to the places they frequented in life . But Jerry had never been to her apartment , knew only what she 'd written to him , had seen only the photographs she 'd sent.  |p84I  have wasted my time , she thought as she left the library that evening . It was almost eight o'clock : she was sick with hunger because she 'd forgotten lunch . " Jerry , " she called as soon as she got home , " Jerry ! " He was not there . She snapped on the living room television , then walked into the kitchen to fix dinner . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of TV voices , watching the campus lights wink and shift in the wind-shaken trees eight stories below . Where do you go , Jerry ? she thought , half-expecting an answer from him . When you 're not here with me , where are you ? Were you annoyed with me for being late ? The kettle whistled ; she poured her tea . Over two years , she thought . And Jerry , you never come close , you stay across the room . Do you want to be here at all ? Ann Martin Richards drank her tea , forehead pressed against the cold window , following the aimless crisscrossing of traffic lights below . It was an evening like any other . He had not come back at once . For at least a month after his funeral , she had been alone , totally alone , in a vast , obscuring , mistlike pain . She had no will , no strength , no control . Her eyelids twitched and she could not stop them . Her fingers danced along tabletops . Once , crossing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she sat there in the middle of traffic while people screamed . When she tried to explain to them , she found she had n't the words either . She was , she thought , like a balloon collapsing . There was nothing inside her . She was disintegrating , the world was pulling away , she would fall off on one of its vertiginous spins . . . She went back to college . Her mother came with her , stayed with her . Ann seemed to remember days that passed without a word between them  --  that could n't be so , she thought . The silence must be inside her own head.  |p85Then  , suddenly , the emptiness disappeared . And she asked her mother to please go home . Definitely . Firmly . Because Jerry was back . It happened like this . Late one afternoon she was walking home , classes finished for the day . ( She did not remember which classes  --  she rememberednothing these days . She had to look at the books in her arms to discover where she 'd been . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apartment  --  saw him perfectly clearly . " Jerry , " she called , and began to run , dodging through traffic . But the sidewalk was empty ; he was gone . She peered through the glass doors into the lobby : plastic plants and shining marble floor and nothing else . She leaned against the building , breathless , heart shaking her ribs . A snow of small black flakes clouded her sight . He is here , she thought , he is back . He found me . After that a sense of him trembled in the air , hung like smoke , to color her days . She found herself looking for him among the dizzy falling tree leaves . She found herself searchingcrowds , to see if he were not hiding among the unknown bodies . He is here . A vast yellow light shivered across everything , detaching objects from their bases so that they floated , an inch or so in the air . She often caught glimpses of him . Each time she ran ; each time he was gone . She began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , could never find him by looking , could never surprise him around a million corners . He would come when he was ready . So , when she saw him again , walking briskly toward the campus through the winter-stripped trees , she only smiled after him . And watched his precise military steps carry him out of sight . She saw him more and more frequently . It was as if he had to accustom himself to the neighborhood , which he hadp86never seen . As if he had to learn the streets and houses one by one . As if he had to be sure of his ground .. . One gusty November afternoon , when the last football game filled the stadium and parked cars jammed the streets , he opened the locked apartment door and walked into the living room . Thereafter her life ran smoothly . She went to classes , cheerful and smiling , saw her credits mount and the date of her graduation draw closer . She was home every evening , except for an occasional movie . She wanted the company of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her alone . Except for Ted Langley . She had , she supposed , dated him a few times , in a manner of speaking . Ted never called her , never asked directly . But outside a classroom , crossing the campus , he would join her . Casually . No sweat , she thought , not with him . Occasionally they went to the zoo to watch the seals feeding . The scarred gray bodies leaping through the air vaguely disgusted her . And amused him  --  " They look just like people I know , " he said . He never asked her to dinner , but after an hour or so of walking along the ammonia-smelling zoo paths , he would say abruptly , " I 'm hungry , are n't you ? " Sometimes they perched on stools , elbows up , like frogs on a log , and ate hamburgers . Sometimes they went to one of the Mexican restaurants that surrounded the campus . And once they went to a Japanese steak house  --  " You got to see this , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in front of you , the way they sort of pet the blade , it 's god damned obscene . " She went , saw , and did n't agree with him . They sat together at campus movies sometimes ; he would spot her in the crowded lobby and wavep87to her . It was one good thing about being so tall , she thought , he could see over the heads of most people . Something was wrong with Jerry . These days he had long silences , when even the outlines and substance of his body would begin to fade . She discovered that she could will him back . She could feel him restoring himself upon her , drawing fullness and depth from her . When he was fleshed and shining again , she was exhausted . Her bones ached ; she could feel her own skeleton beneath her skin . I am sucked dry , she thought , my bones are hollow . Jerry lives from me . He is my baby and I suckle him , nurse him , sustain him .. . But sometimes she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a beautiful day , summer heat gone , winter rains not yet begun . The trees were bare but there was a brilliant green in the experimental fescue grasses on the lawn of the agriculture school . I will go for a walk , she thought . Exercise may stop my aching , and the air is so lovely . Purse on her shoulder , notebookin hand , she selected the long diagonal brick walk that ran across the center of the campus . At once she began to feel better ; she lengthened her stride , the air swirling around her . She 'd walked this way with Jerry  --  it was almost three years ago now ; these very same bricks held the echoes of their steps somewhere in their grainy interior . Those were the weekends Jerry came to visit her , before their marriage . They 'd walked for hours  --  past the campus , through the town , out into the fields , along dirt roads stitched together with tractor treads . Jerry , she thought , oh Jerry , how lovely , how exquisite those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When every breath hurt with the beauty of things . When the faint touch of a rough Harris tweed jacket was shivering delight . Though he was a professional soldier , he 'd never oncep88worn his uniform  --  he almost seemed to avoid it with her . He had n't even married in uniform , though he was fourth-generationWest Point . " My family expects it , " he said , " but only because of tradition . They have n't really thought about it . My uniform is a symbol of war . It 's not appropriate in a ceremony dedicated to love . " He was , she thought walking alone across the autumnbrownedcampus , the most logical man she had ever met . The most intelligent , the most direct . Assurance clung to him like perfume around a beautiful woman . Absolute , unaffected assurance . Jerry , she thought , even from this distance in time , oh Jerry . She 'd met him at the tennis club on Nantucket , her first summer there . His family had been coming for years to the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , leaning against the wire fencing , openly laughing . When she 'd finished  --  her face flushed bright red , her hair dangling in soaking strings from her white headband  --  he said , " It 's too hot for tennis . Come sailing with me this afternoon . " Later he drove her home , the sound of the wind still in her ears , the smooth salt spray still on her face . He leaned across the front seat of his car , speaking to her through the halfcloseddoor : " You do n't know it yet , but you 're going to marry me . And that was that . They had only two days then , his leave was over . Occasionally on weekends he would fly to see her at college , but not often . He was saving his leave for their honeymoon . Yes , she found herself saying over and over again . Yes . Yes . She had a sense of rightness , of things fitting into their proper places . When their honeymoon was over , and they moved into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of uniforms lined neatly in the closet . I had forgotten , she thought , I had truly forgotten . . . Six months later his expected orders came , and he left top89find the combat experience so necessary to his promotion . " A field command is part of the seasoning of an officer , Ann . It 's what I should be doing . " She agreed smilingly . Jerry would be one of the youngest generals in army history , his family assured her ; he had a great career ahead . She closed that apartment , helped by his mother , and went back to college . There , helped by her mother , she found anotherapartment , furnished it , and settled down to the business of waiting . She wrote every day . " You would like this apartment , Jerry . There 's a nice pool I have n't had time to use . And the view from the living room is really quite remarkable . By the way , Mother wants to give us that de Kooning you admired so much when we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather not ? " Daily letters from a young wife , waiting , cradled in moneylinedcomfort . His letters were long descriptions of the country and the people . He was studying their language and making fair progress . He was trying to understand Buddhism but there did n't seem to be any really informative texts . . . He made no mention of the war . Nothing to disturb her perfect cocoon , her total security . Ann Martin Richards , alone , walked briskly along the path , conscious only of the pleasure of her body moving lightly in the cool air . Tall , thin razor body cutting through the air like a ship . " Ann , wait ! " Ted Langley 's broad pink face and thin blond mustache grinned happily at her . " I 've been yelling at you for the last block . " She chuckled at her own nonsense . " I was pretending to be a ship . " " You what ? " He slipped into step beside her.  | " I 'm taking a walk . " " Let 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll even have a new young one that you can like . " The feel of his hand on her arm was quite pleasant and the short drive in his yellow VW was far more interesting than a walk . She did not think about Ted , Ann admitted to herself , unlessshe was with him . But when she was , when his large angular body was next to her , she found that she liked him very much indeed . He 'd been around for such a long time , she thought , since those first months after Jerry 's death . She 'd become aware of him gradually , of his name , of his appearance . He drifted into her sight and her awareness . He was a gentle , firm pressure , unhurried , unchanging . When he was with her , she even felt the lap of a small tongue of desire . Muted and buried and frightened , but there . There were no new seals in the zoo 's pool . " Bad idea , lady , " he admitted . " Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a Chinese restaurant a half-hour drive from town through cut bare fields where swarms of blackbirds whirled . After dinner he said , " Did you know the music school 's doing John Cage tonight ? What do you think of the new music ? " One thing at a time , patiently , insistently . They left the auditorium early to drink beer in a crowded student bar two blocks from her apartment . We have come home , Ann thought calmly . We have made a big circle of miles and miles but come back home at last . She was slightly tired and slightly sleepy , and she could feel his warmth surrounding her , wrapping her , like a present in gold foil . . . Ted said quietly to the foam in his heavy mug , " Ann , listen to me . " " Ted , I do n't want to . " She knew her eyes were getting wide and round and she hated that.  |p91He  went on talking to the beer . " There been any man since your husband ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considered lying , then did n't . " No . " " I thought so . " For no reason at all she said , " He was killed in Quang Tri . " " I was in the north too , " he said . " That little death detail come calling on you ? " " Very early one morning  --  I was still asleep . " She 'd never talked about it before , none of it , but now it was as if she 'd just been waiting . " A captain and a sergeant , and their uniformswere so crisp and shiny I thought they must be made of plastic . " Ted reached across the table and took her hand . " Do n't pass out on me . " " I have never fainted in my life , " she said angrily , " I do n't see why I should start now . " His lopsided grin twisted the new mustache . His teeth were widely spaced and perfectly even , like the teeth of some small animal . " You want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the mud , trying to find decent cover while somebody called in air strikes . " Very faintly in the deep recesses of her mind she was beginning to hear all the things that Jerry 's letters had n't mentioned . All the bloody things she did not need to know . Ted was still holding her hand ; he began playing with the tips of her fingers . " Let 's go to your place . " " No , " she said as they went outside . It had gotten much colder , she shivered inside her light coat . " Hurry , " he said . At her building the elevator was waiting for them ; sliding doors opened and closed like wings before them . He took the key from her and opened the door himself . " Ann , " he said seriously , " I have waited one hell of a long time for this , ever since I saw you . "  | " Why , yes , " she said , stopping suddenly in the middle of the floor , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silent with a churchlike emptiness . The next afternoon Ted waited at her economics class . " You miss me ? " It was n't at all difficult for her to smile and nod and find her fingers on his arm . The wiry strength of his body was so familiar to her . " Let 's drive to Dauphin Island , " Ted said . " It ought to be warm enough for a last swim or something like that . " So they went , driving all night to spend a weekend doing nothing on coarse yellow sands . " You know , " she said practically , " there 's a heated pool in my building . We could have avoided that long drive . " " Old lady , "  --  Ted tapped her stomach through the slick nylon of her bathing suit  --  " old lady , you have to work to have fun . " So each weekend they drove somewhere , anywhere . At the long Thanksgiving holiday they drove to the Ozarks and walked through the bone-bleached hills while quail whirred up from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of huckleberry bushes . " You were beautiful when I met you , " Ted said , " but you 're incredible now . ' I must agree with you . " She could feel it herself , this happiness . Like a balloon floating , a cat stretching in the sun . The very tips of her fingers tingled now and then with the strength of her coursing blood . And Jerry stayed away.  |p93At  Christmas , they each went home . She thought once , briefly : Jerry , will you use the apartment when I 'm gone ? Jerry , why do n't you answer me ? Ted phoned her every day , amusing chatty calls that soon included her parents . " He has such a nice voice , " her mother said . And then she carefully and obviously refrained from sayinganything else . Early one morning , two days after Christmas , Ted 's call woke her : " Let 's go to Aspen for the rest of the holidays . " Ann blinked sleepily at the ceiling . It was not yet seven o'clock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What ? " " Wake up , honey . And listen . There 's a flight at noon , you can make that . I 'll meet you in Chicago and we 'll fly together to Aspen . Okay ? " She shifted the phone to her other hand , thinking of powder snow and thin clear air and the feeling of love on all sides of her , enclosing her like the mountains .. . " What 's the matter ? " The snow and the cold dry mountain air blew away from her face , leaving only a tiny mocking echo of their presence . " Oh , Ted , I 'm supposed to go to the Virgin Islands with my parents . " A small pause . She could hear him breathing ; he had not expected her to say no . For a moment she hesitated , then the thought of her father 's pale , waxy face decided her . " Ted , my father needs this , he 's been working far too hard after that coronary last year . If I do n't go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Right , " Ted said calmly . " Talk to you when you get back . " She went . And dreamt of snow mountains . Afterwards , she was suddenly so very tired , too tired to go back to college . For four days she lay in bed , doing nothing . She held a book in her hand and did not read . The TV control lay on her pillow , untouched . The house hustled and whis/pered and busied about her . Her father brought breakfast before he left in the morning . Her mother brought lunch . She was always fast asleep by dinner . Ted still called every day ; usually he spoke to her mother . She hung immobile , timeless , aching softly . The lethargy passed . One morning her eyes opened wide and there was no more weight on their lids , her shoulders no longer clung to the support of the bed . She flew back to college the next day , took a taxi through the rainy winter dusk to her apartment . She nodded to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have you back , Mrs. Richards , " with " Did you have a nice holiday ? " She collected her mail -- nothing interesting : some circulars , the usual first of the month bills , now fairly well overdue ; a dozen or so letters whose return addresses she did not recognize . She crumpled them into her coat pocket  --  morning was time enough . She glanced into the patio ; it was rain-polished and winter-stripped , the iron furniture piled in sheltered corners and covered with green plastic . Hard to remembersummer there . In the tiny foyer outside her door , she put down her bags and fumbled for the key . She 'd turned the lock before she noticed : It 's different . Something 's different . She lifted both suitcases inside , carefully closed the door behind her , automatically slipping the bolt . " Jerry ? " " Here , " he said . He was sitting in the big chair by the window , his favorite chair . The lamp light fell on his yellow sweater , on the book in his hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I was waiting for you , " he said . " Jerry , I did n't know you wore glasses . " " We get older , " he said , " we all get older . " She dropped her purse to the coffee table . " I 'm glad you 're back , " she said . " It was lonesome without you . " " I know about that , " he said . " I never said anything in my letters , but I was lonesome all those months . "  | " I wish you 'd said more in your letters . " " So do I. " There was an edge to his voice , an anger . Abruptly she changed the subject . " I always did like that sweater , particularlywith gray flannels . " He smiled at her , his steady confident smile . " You look rather tired , " he said . " Have you been sick ? " " I 'm just tired now . I think I 'll unpack and not bother with supper . I never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Methodically she hung her clothes away , then put the suitcases in the living room closet . Jerry went on reading . She could n't quite make out the title . " What 's that ? " she asked . He seemed too absorbed to hear her . She stood looking at him , thinking that she had never seen him more clearly . There was a solidness to his figure  --  if she touched him she was certain she would be able to feel him . She was so sure . . . but he might not like it .. . She would bathe now . As she undressed , the phone rang ; she did not bother to answer , though there was an extension at her hand . She soaked in bubble bath and steam , slowly stretching , slowing easing herself into sleep . How comfortable it is with Jerry here .. . Once she thought she heard the front door buzzer , but she ignored it . Eventually , water-logged , wrinkled , and sleepy , she toweled dry in front of the mirror . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm heavier than I was and hollows are beginning to appear on my thighs and my skin is n't as shiny as it used to be , even with the bath oil ; there is n't such a glow to it any more . In a little while I 'll have to wear glasses too . She fell asleep at once . And woke to find Jerry sitting on the side of the bed . He 'd never come this close before , not ever . In the dim light from the open window she saw that he 'd changed to pajamas . Elbows on knees , he sat there , having a last cigarette before coming to bed.  | " Jerry , " she said , sleepily , " I have to tell you . There was somebody else , did you know ? " His handsome profile shivered for a moment . It was , she thought , a sigh . When she woke again , the window was still opaque with night . He was no longer sitting on the side of the bed , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She could still feel the press of his fingers . " Jerry , are you there ? " He answered from the shadows in the far corner . " I suppose I 'll always be here . " The insistent ringing of her door bell woke her  --  somebody was standing outside , finger pinned to the buzzer . She pulled on a robe and , hair uncombed and eyes heavy with sleep , she went to answer . Ted walked into the room . " I called you last night . Where have you been ? " He yanked open the curtains . It was a brilliant sunlit morning . " I was about to go for the police . " " I 've been here , Ted . " " I know you 've been here . I talked to your mother yesterday . So why did n't you answer your phone ? " " I was taking a bath I guess . I thought I heard the phone when I was taking a bath . " " You could have called me . " " I should have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tired , I fell asleep . " " I came over here last night , and I rang your bell and I peeped through the crack under the door . There was a light on . " " Jerry was reading in there last night . " " Jesus Christ , woman ! " Ted pulled her into the pool of yellow winter sunlight by the window . " He 's dead , he 's been dead for almost three years . " " I know that , Ted . I was at the funeral . " " Then what the hell is all this coming back business . "  |p97Two  absurd tears ran down her cheeks ; she brushed them away impatiently . " Do n't yell at me , Ted . " He bent , peering sharply into her face . " You eat anything yesterday ? " She made a vague little apologetic gesture , as if ashamed to have been caught out . " I do n't like airplane food . " " Okay . Was there anything in the apartment for supper last night ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tired . " " So first we feed you . " The refrigerator was empty , but there were canned soups on the shelf . " Obviously , " Ted said , " you need me to take care of you . You 're having soup for breakfast . " The bowl of shiny tomato-flecked liquid appalled her , but she ate it dutifully while Ted watched . " Now that , " he said , " is much better . " They sat at the tiny corner table , looking out across the tops of the trees into the flat plains beyond town , drinking cup after cup of instant coffee with canned milk . The soft insistence of his presence was all around her again . Demanding . Promising . She shivered slightly . " I really should get dressed . " She automatically smoothed her uncombed hair . " Do n't bother , " he said , " we 're only going back to bed . " Later , limp and groggy with sex , they dozed lightly . Ann , turning over , glanced through the open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was considerably smaller than life . As if he were a long distance away . As if this door were the beginning of a long transparent tunnel and he stood far down its length . He said nothing , he did not move , he seemed to be staring at a point directly over the bed . He is n't looking at me , Ann thought . Ted stretched and kissed her neck . " Want a cigarette ? " " Do you see him ? " Like a light winking out Jerry was gone.  | " See who , honey ? " " Jerry was there . " Abruptly Ted got up , then just as abruptly sat down again on the crumpled blanket across the foot of the bed . Naked men look more vulnerable and stripped than women , she thought . " Jesus Christ , " Ted said , " why does n't he come right in and stand by the bed and watch . And let me see him too . " " I think he will , " Ann said quietly , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to light a cigarette , his hands shakingever so slightly . " God damn it , Ann , if I died there 'd be somebody else and Jerry and I both would be off somewhere being jealous of him . . . Ann , listen to me now . I wanted to ask you this in Aspen but you would n't come , so I 'll ask you now . Let 's get married . " " I am married , " she said . He ignored her . " I finish school in May , go to work for my father , have a quick rise in the firm , due entirely to my own merits of course . So we 'll get the license tomorrow and get married on Thursday . " " Ted , it 's not like that . " " It is now . " He drew on his cigarette . " And I 'm not going to let you out of my sight until then . Just to keep my place , " He chuckled softly . " Anything moving around here will be me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appear . They were married on Thursday . The ground whitened with the first serious snowfall of the year and planes came in late or not at all . The Unitarian chaplain obligingly rescheduled the ceremony twice until the last of the family had arrived ( Ted 's older brother Jess , who came the last fifty miles by bus ) . After the ceremony , flushed and jovial with champagne , they scattered again : clutching tickets , staring at the heavyp99gray snow-laden sky , calling hasty good-bys at the airport . Ann and Ted went to Mexico City for the weekend , returningfor their Tuesday classes . The clock in the campus tower was striking midnight when they walked into their apartment building . " Here comes Tuesday , " Ted said . In the elevator Ann noticed : It 's something , it 's something . I feel it . A breathing , a stirring . The edges of things are beginning to dazzle , to flame . To reassemble themselves in a different order .. . The tiny black and white foyer outside the elevator was empty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and crooked , above the brass nameplate . Her own door was sleek and smooth , waiting . The brass plate gleamed a bit too brightly , and the painted wood seemed soft as velvet .. . Jerry is back , she thought , Jerry is here . I know it . The door stuck . Ted pushed it harder and it flew open , crashing into the wall . Ann rushed past him into the living room . Jerry was waiting , in the big chair by the window . Wearingyellow sweater and gray flannels . He was smiling directly at her . I 'm so glad , Jerry , she said silently , because it would only hurt Ted 's feelings to hear . You 're not angry about Ted ? You wo n't leave because there are three of us now ? Jerry went on smiling his kindest , most radiant smile . The edges of his figure shivered and sparkled with points of light . Not this time . Not again . I 'll be here , he said , I 'll be here . With a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ted was just slipping the bolt across the door . " Why were you in such a hurry , honey ? Anything important ? " " Come see , " she said , " just come see . " The room shimmered and glowed all around her as she slipped her arm through his and led him into the living room to meet her husband.  |p100Like  the weeks that had preceded it , the day was hot . There was n't a speck of dust or a breath of air moving . Under the burning white light of the sun , things seemed closer than they were really . Hilda Marie Merrick , who was called Patsy , sat on the edge of the front porch and dangled her bare legs . She had been home from the hospital a week , and there was nothing to do . She lifted her right leg to stare attentively at the red polish on her toenails . She 'd been up since eight , when the morning got too hot for sleeping . She 'd washed her hair and set it too tightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I woke up this morning , I wanted to die , " she called over her shoulder . In the living room , by the open window , her mother sealed the letter she had just finished and began writing the address . " Did you , dear ? " " Yes , I did . " Patsy reached one finger to loosen the tightest of the curls . " Mother , do you know that there is not a single person left in this town that I would care to talk to . They have gone to camp , every single one of them . " Mrs. Merrick 's voice took on a faint warning color . " The doctor told you no. "  | " I do n't care what he said . I just do n't care . " " Now you 're being silly . " " I would n't hurt myself . I could be so careful . " " No . " There was the soft rubbing sound of pen on paper , and over by the hedge the ragged sound of a cricket . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You would think that with the way they all came down to the hospital and stood around , looking all worried and wanting to do every little thing for me  --  a person would think that they would n't go off to camp and leave me where I have n't got a single person I know in town . " " Oh , Patsy . " " It is not often that eleven-year-old people have their appendix out , and as serious as mine . " " It was n't serious . " " It was . I could feel it . You just do n't know what it was like . " " Baby , how spoiled you got . " " You do n't know . " Patsy 's hand felt lightly for the scar . " It 's still sore . " Across the street a power mower started noisily , and from farther away still came the empty sound of a horse 's hoofs and the singsong chant of a fruit vendor . The street was paved on one side only . The city council had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they had overestimated the available funds . They had then announced that unless the people who lived on the street paid for it themselves , it would stay that way . It had stayed that way . A small girl , not more than eight or so , came up the center of the half-paved road and in through the Merricks ' gate , walking with the measured , scuffing tread of her age . Her hair was pulled back freshly into two pigtails , which stuck out from the nape of her neck ; from each one dropped a ribbon . The starchiness of her dress was already beginning top102wilt in the heat . One hand was stuck into the skirt pocket . The other hand held a brown roll  --  an old-fashioned leather music case . She climbed the steps , smiled shyly at Patsy and Mrs. Merrick , and , with a sidling glide , slipped in the front door . Between her thin , nubby shoulders her dress was already stained by perspiration . " I did n't look like that , " Patsy said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did , " her mother said . " No . " Mrs. Merrick began putting the note paper back in the box . " Why are you so trying , dear ? " " I was born that way . " Patsy pointed her nose at the white , hot sky . " Mother , I itch all over . " " The heat powder is in the downstairs bathroom . " " It 's not that kind of a thing . I feel just like I could shake myself once or twice and my skin would fall right off . Like I 'm not attached to it at all . " " The heat is bad , " Mrs. Merrick said . Her gray eyes had a misty look as they stared out at the lawn . And her pencil was busy making little- doodling marks . From inside the house came the first hesitant chords of the scale . " Here we go . " Patsy gave a long , whistling sigh . " Why does Claude have to take pupils here ? " " Because there is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " Inside , fumbling fingers began striking G-major chords . Patsy closed her eyes and tried seeing how long she could hold her breath . Her eyes popped open when a truck stopped , but she was so intent on holding her breath that she did n't wonder about the large crate two men unloaded . She went on counting . The men balanced the crate on the edge of the- steps and wiped the perspiration from their chins . " Where you reckon you want this ? " one asked . He had bright china-blue eyes behind the tight folds of lids squinched up against the glare.  |p103Patsy  shrugged and went on with her silent counting . Fifty-one , fifty-two , fifty-three . . . She heard the door bell and then her mother 's surprised murmur . She always manages to sound surprised , Patsy thought . And at that exact moment , without thinking , without deciding , she took a long breath of air . Fifty-eight . " Patsy , honey , " her mother called . " Come see  --  the new television 's here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her mother was signingthe receipt , on the top of the packing case . In the little room on the left that they called the music room she could see the bent small back of the pigtailed girl and the bent long back of her brother Claude . His finger moved directingly up and down , keeping time . Patsy sat down in the hall , in one of the round-backed chairs that had belonged to her grandmother , and waited until the men had just passed her and were at the front door . " Mama , " she said , " I 'm growing again . I got to get a bigger bra . " The men coughed with laughter , and her mother closed the front door sharply after them . To Patsy , she said , " Just what are you trying to do ? " " Nothing . " Patsy stared after the men , puzzled . She had not expected the laugh  --  a look maybe , or a wink . " I hate people . " " Young lady , you 'd better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and left her . The little pigtailed musician departed , grinning broadly this time . Her dress was soaked with perspiration , her glasses were blurred and smeary , too , but she did not seem to notice . She had put her music away so hastily that the white edges showed ragged at the ends of the rolled case . Only one of the leather straps was fastened ; the other dragged in the dirt . She skipped out the front gate and began to run back the way she hadp104come , following the exact center of the street , so that one foot ran on concrete , the other on mud . It gave her a kind of lopsided , jack-rabbit pace . " If there was any traffic , she 'd get killed , " Patsy said with satisfaction . She had returned to the porch . " But there is n't , " Claude said . He swung his long leg over a chair and sat astride it . The Coke bottle in his hand dripped bits of ice to the porch floor . " You did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is the last . " " Now , that 's not true . I saw a whole case . " " They 're all warm . " He held out the bottle . " You want the rest of this ? " " No . " She threw back her head and stared at the bright blue ceiling . Wasps were building their round mud nests up against one corner . " You 've got all sorts of germs I do n't want to catch . " " Okay . " " You drink noisier than anybody I ever knew . " " More noisily , " he corrected . " Why do you have to wear those silly-looking shorts ? " He tipped his head back and finished the Coke with a gurgle . " And those long socks are the silliest things I ever did see . " " Quit it . " " You 're too thin to wear things like that  --  that 's what Mama told you . " " One day , " Claude said , " I 'm going to strangle you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for shorts . I heard her . " He yawned . " You got the biggest teeth I ever saw , " she said . " Like a horse . " " Do you want to fight ? " He pulled out his handkerchief and dried his hands . " I have n't got time now . Later this evening , huh ? "  |p105Patsy  turned away . " I do n't want to be here this evening . I wo n't be here this evening at all . " Mrs. Merrick appeared . She was one of those women who never step outside without a hat  --  in winter because it is cold and in summer because it is sunny . Now she wore a lightgreenstraw with a wide , flopping brim . " You 're always wearing green , " Patsy said accusingly . " Idiot child , shut up . " Claude balanced the bottle on one finger . " Really , Claude , " Mrs. Merrick said . " Do n't be nasty to her . " " You heard her , " Patsy said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and blew through loose lips : " Ruuuuup . " " I wish I had eyes pretty as yours , Mama , " Patsy said . " Honey , you have lovely eyes . " " Brown . " Patsy crinkled up the corners of her mouth in disgust . " Everybody 's got brown eyes . And anyhow it makes me look like Claude . " " God forbid , " Claude said softly , and his mother threw him a warning glance . " Patsy , honey , do n't you want to come along with me ? " she said . " Where ? " " I 'm going to pick up the laundry . " " Nuh-uh . " " It would give you something to do . " Mrs. Merrick said . " We 'll be right back . " A ride across the little town to the Negro section , which was called Bridge City . Then a talk with the laundress while her oldest son brought out the bundle and put it in the back seat of the car and her other kids swung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big chinaberry tree . " No , " she said . " Did Mary Beth finish her lesson , Claude ? " Mrs. Merrick asked  | " Yep . Lucille wo n't be along until three-thirty . " " Why do I have to have a brother who gives music lessons ? " Patsy demanded . " Now , dear , " her mother said . " Why ca n't it ever be quiet around here . " " Hilda Marie , you are being mean , plain and simple mean , to your only brother , " her mother said . " I want to be mean . I want to . " Mrs. Merrick only waved as she headed for the garage . " You are crazy , " Claude told Patsy pleasantly and went inside to put back the Coke bottle . Patsy threw her head far back over her chair , pressing until the wood cut into the back of her neck and little lights danced in front of her eyes . " Fool jackass ! " she cried at the top of her voice . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a short , very heavy man , looked longinglyat the other plates and then began his own low-calorie fare . " I do n't see how you eat that without salt , " Patsy said . " And so dreadful to begin with . " " I do n't either , kitten , " her father said . " You 'd think Claude would put on some weight , instead of being a bean pole like he is , " Patsy said . " Like is not a conjunction , " Claude said . " Now do n't begin that , " her mother said . " What grades did you get in English ? " Claude asked . " I got a B-plus , Mr. Jackass . " " That 's enough , " her father said . Patsy moved her fork in circles around her plate , following the gold bands . " I reckon I am not hungry . I would like to be excused . " " You 're not sick , dear ? " her mother asked . Patsy turned at the door , with one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said . " I am dying of loneliness with everyoneaway . " " What an act , " Claude said . Patsy retreated to a porch chair and propped her feet up on the railing . She was trying with all her might to see if she could pop the back hook of her bra by hunching her shoulders when her father came out and sat beside her . " Dessert ? " He offered her a plate . She shook her head sadly . " Like I said , I am not hungry . " She regretted the first word the minute it was out of her mouth , but he did not correct her . He still held out the plate . " Chocolate cake . " She took it . " Mama said it was n't polite to offer things with your left hand . " " She 's absolutely right , " Mr. Merrick said , " but I am not going to fight , kitten , so stop trying . " " I wish you would stop calling me that name . I hate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " he suggested . She made a face . " What , then ? " She did not answer . " Do n't forget to take the plate in with you , kitten , when you go , " Mr. Merrick said , getting up . " Daddy , " she said . He turned . " Ca n't I come to town with you ? " He put one foot on the step and leaned his elbow on his knee . " Kitten , you 'd be in the office half an hour and you 'd get tired and want to come home . And I 'd have to stop and bring you . " " No , " she said . " No , I would n't . " But he shook his head and was gone . In the shade of the big red honeysuckle , an orange-striped cat stretched lazily , and then it sauntered over to the deeper shade of the butterfly bush . The long , hot afternoon was beginning.  |p108Claude  came out and started down the steps . " Everybody 's leaving , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so she followed him , scuffing her heels on the gravel of the walk . " Where are you going ? " she asked . His car was at the curb . " I 'm going to see Joyce . " " Like that ? " She pointed to his shorts . " I did n't thinkyou 'd want anybody outside the family to see you like that . " " Look , twerp . . . Why do n't you find something to do ? Anything . " " That 's what everybody tells me . You going to play bridge ? " " Yes , I am . " " I could play with you . " " If you could play . " " You could teach me . " " No , " Claude said . " It would n't take long . " " Not on your life . " He got in the car and pulled the door to . She stuck her head in the window . " If I had a car , I could drive around and visit people way over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He switched on the ignition and started the motor . " Well , you have n't . Now move before you get hurt . " The car drove away . She stood and watched , swinging her right leg back and forth so that her sandal scuffed along the gutter edge . After the car disappeared , she stared down at her moving foot . Then , carefully , she bent her sandal back against the cement . Pressing with all her weight , she snapped the sole so that it flapped loosely as she walked . In the side yard a mulberry tree was dropping its full purple berries into the grass . She heard them squish under her feet . From a branch just over her head she pulled one of the nubby berries , and put it in her mouth . It prickled for an instant and tasted of dust . Then the heavy , overripe juice flooded out on her tongue . She reached up for a cluster ofp109berries this time . They crushed between her grasping fingers . She whistled softly between her teeth and wiped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had left one of his hunting knives on the back porch . She picked it up and began tossing it idly into the ground , trying without success to spear a small fragment of wood . Tiring of this , she left the knife sticking in the ground and wandered over to the sunny end of the porch to inspect her geraniums  --  four little pots of earth , each with a couple of scraggly stems reaching up into the air . Only one had a leaf , a shriveled brown bit that wrapped itself around the dead stalk . Patsy filled the watering can and poured a little water on each one . Then she went into the kitchen . " Fanny . " The short , stocky black woman turned around . " Yeah ? " " We got any coffee grounds ? " Even as she asked , Patsy was making for the coffeepot . " What you want that for ? " " My geraniums . " They had been on her bedside table at the hospital , and she had loved each single one . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ai n't nothing gon na help them plants . Watch out my floor ! " Fanny said as Patsy carried a handful of dripping grounds . " They is dead . " Patsy sprinkled the grounds around the bare twigs , watered them again , and went back in the kitchen . She got herself a glass of water and leaned on the refrigerator , drinking and swinging her leg so that the broken sandal flapped slowly . Fanny turned . She was perched on a high red stool at the sink , polishing demitasse spoons . " What I hearing ? " Patsy held up her foot . " Might just as well throw them out . They ai n't no more good than those plants of yours , " Fanny said . Patsy rubbed the back of her thighs against the cool enamel of the refrigerator . " This is the longest day . "  | " Iffen you want things to do , you could get that big silver pitcher from out the dining room and polish it up . " " Did Estes come yet ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years older than Patsy . He came sometimes to keep his mother company , if he did n't have anything else to do . " Did he ? " Patsy demanded . " No , he ai n't , yet . " Patsy stood on one leg and curled the lifted foot around the other ankle . She watched Fanny 's movements , narrowing her left eye with the effort of her perception . " Lord , but you sure are slow . " The hand stopped its motion . " You come all the way back here to pester me ? " " Nuh-uh . Fanny , why do n't you give them to him ? " Fanny reached her rag into the jar of pink silver polish . " Give who to who ? " " You just do n't listen to me . Give those spoons , the ones right there , to Estes . " " Now , why I want to do that ? " " He could sell them for a lot of money . " Patsy squatted down on the floor . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She say it ai n't becoming for a young lady . " Patsy pretended not to hear . " Do n't you want to make a lot of money ? " Fanny turned around again . " And what you mania going to say to that ? " " She would n't know . " " And what the police gon na say when they see you mama 's initials all over the tops of them spoons ? " " We could take the initials off , " Patsy said , " or take them over to Atlanta , where nobody 'd know . " " You been looking too much at that television . I told you mama that . " " That 's got nothing to do with it . "  | " You looking at it all day in the hospital there , I told her it ai n't good . " " You talk so much . Yack , yack , yack . " Fanny swung back to her work , so violently that she had to catch hold of the counter for balance . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lip , Patsy gazed up at the crosspiece of the doorway . After a minute , she said , " I bet you anything I could chin myself on that . " Fanny whistled  --  " Euuuuuuu . " " Well , I could . " " And bust all that stitching the doctor put in your stomach . And pour your insides all out over the floor . " Patsy stood up , her arms moving nervously . That was a nightmare she had sometimes : the hole in her stomach opening up . Sornetimes , when she woke up , she would reach inside her pajamas and run her fingers along the new scar , just to be sure that it still held together . " Fanny , what would you do if I was sick right here ? " " Iffen you gon na get sick , you just plain better go out in the back yard , where it do n't matter none , " Fanny said calmly . Patsy pounded her fist against the door . " You are just so mean that I am going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm gon na tell everybody about you , and you wo n't be able to get another job , and you 'll starve to death . That 's what I 'll do . " " Man , man , " Fanny said to the chrome-plated faucet of the sink . " She sure is changed . They must put something else in her when they took that appendix out . " Before she thought , Patsy said , " You reckon they did ? " " You reckon they did ? " Fanny mimicked in a high-pitched voice . " You reckon they did ? " " Crazy fool jackass ! " Patsy exploded as she banged out the door . " Crazy fool jackass ! "  |p112Fanny  shouted after her , " They done fill you up with all sorts of garbage to make you act so ugly ! That what they done ! " Tucking her hands in the back belt of her shorts , Patsy sauntered around the corner of the house , still whispering to herself , " Fool jackass , crazy fool jackass . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by one of the big old hydrangea bushes . The Dillards lived next door . " What are you doing by my house ? " Patsy asked . Jo turned her head slowly , and the clear , blue , five-yearoldgaze focused first on Patsy 's feet , then climbed her body , coming almost indifferently to her face . " I asked you what you doing by my house . " The eyes climbed down the body again . " Digging , " Jo said . She pointed with her left hand . " See ? " Behind the hydrangeabush was a little hole she was making with an old wavy-bladed bread knife . " What you doing that for ? " " Nothing . Digging . " " You 're lying . " Jo did not answer . " Tell me . " " Huh ? " " You tell me . " Jo turned back to her work . Two thin sinews stood out on the back of her neck , beneath the ragged fringe of her clipped hair . " You are the ugliest-looking kid I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are positively the ugliest thing . And you get uglier every day . You do . " The eyes lifted , circled her face , and wandered off . " And the way you do everything with your left hand  --  that 's the silliest thing , too . " The child went on digging , her head bent . " Tell me . " Patsy 's voice dropped , and she crouched down by the smaller figure.  |p113The  child watched the ground intently , fascinated by each small load of mud . A round white marble came to the surface . Two small , squarish fingers went down and picked it up ; the hand closed over it . " What you find ? " The knife continued to lift small pats of dirt . " What did you find in my garden ? Give it here . " The blade fell to the ground . Jo clenched both hands around the marble . Her fingers wove tightly together . Patsy picked up the knife . She scraped it against the brick foundation and ran her finger over the wavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kill you , " she said . " And a dozen policemenwill come to take you away . " With a small whinny of fear , Jo scuttled home , her hands still clenched . Patsy jumped up and , waving the knife over her head , shouted , " Do n't come back ! Do n't ever come back ! " She tossed the knife up against the trunk of the hydrangea bush and walked away , wiping her dirty hands on her bare thighs . A window flew up , and Mrs. Dillard called , " Patsy , what are you doing ! Patsy . . . " She pretended not to hear as she strolled to the back of the yard , rolling her hips under the tight white shorts . In the quiet of the hot afternoon , she could hear the clickingof the dial phone . " Maybe she is calling the police , " she told herself aloud . " And they will come and get me in one of the white cars with the chrome siren on top . And my scar will pop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She fingered her side ; it was sore to the touch . Inside her own house , the phone began to ring . She cocked her head , listening . She could almost hear Mrs. Dillard 's angry words . " She is old and ugly , " Patsy said aloud . From a low branch a fat swallow beat a clumsy flight . " She is old and fat and ugly and I hate her . " Dragging her feet so that the tips of her toes brushed thep114crispy edges of the grass , she went around the two chinaberry trees , grown close together and circled by an old wisteria vine with ragged shreds of flowers still among its leaves . She was hidden from the house . Her mother appeared on the side porch and called , " Patsy ! " " She is old and ugly and I hate her , too . " Patsy whispered . " Patsy , come here this instant . This very instant . " Patsy reached out and took hold of the sharp rough barkof the tree . " No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Through the vines Patsy saw the sun glint on her black skin . " What she did this time ? " Mrs. Merrick opened the screen and came down into the yard ; her heels made a sharp clatter on each step . " This is just too much . " " What she did ? " " Patsy ! " Her mother folded her hands and rested her chin on them . She was really angry ; that was a sure sign . " Ugly , " Patsy whispered . Right in front of her were crosspieces of wood nailed to the trunk of one of the chinaberry trees  --  the steps leading up to the tree house . She tilted back her head . Vaguely , through the dense foliage , she could see the brown , weathered boards . Slowly and carefully , so as not to hurt her scar , she began to climb . " Patsy ! . . . Look in the back yard , Fanny . " Mrs. Merrick started across the grass . Patsy reached the platform , railless and tiny : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wood that had been warped by winter rains and stained almost black by the falling berries . " I wo n't ever come down , " she whispered . The sound startled her , so she went on talking to herself silently . I 'll live up here . Until I get old and die . I 'll stay until I get old and older and die.  |p115Below  , hidden by the feathery leaves , her mother demanded , " Patsy , come here immediately . " I wo n't ever come down . I wo n't . She clenched her fists and closed her eyes in determination . But already , under the lids , the tears were beginning.  |p116rom  the open Atlantic beyond Timbalier Head a few scattered fog horns grunted , muffled and faint . That bank had been hanging off shore for days . We 'd been watching the big draggers chug up to it , get dimmer and dimmer , and finally disappear in its grayness , leaving only the stifled sounds of their horns behind . It had been there so long we got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as always being there , like another piece of land , maybe . The particular day I 'm thinking about started out clear and hot with a tiny breeze  --  a perfect day for a Snipe or a Sailfish . There were a few of them moving on the big bay , not many . And they stayed close to shore , for the barometer was drifting slowly down in its tube and the wind was shifting slowly backward around the compass . Larger sailboats never came into the bay  --  it was too shallow for them  --  and these small ones , motorless , moving with the smallest stir of air , could sail for home , if the fog came in , by following the shore  --  or if there was really no wind at all , they could be paddled in and beached . Then their crews could walk to the nearest phone and call to be picked up . You had to do it that way , because the fog always came in so quick . As it did that morning.  |p117My  sister and I were working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Because the spring tides washed over this stretch , there were no trees , no bushes even , just snail grass and beach lettuce and pink flowering sea lavender , things that liked salt . All morning it had been bright and blue and shining . Then all at once it turned gray and wet , like an unfailing rain , moveless and still . We went right on sanding and from being sweaty hot we turned sweaty cold , the fog chilling and dripping off our faces . " It is n't worth the money , " my sister said , She is ten and that is her favorite sentence . This time it was n't even true . She was the one who 'd talked my father into giving us the job . I would n't give her the satisfaction of an answer , though I did n't like the wet any more than she did . It was sure to make my hair roll up in tight little curls all over my head and I would have to wash it again and sleep on the hard metal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sister said , " Let 's go get a Coke . " When we turned around to go back up to the house , we found that it had disappeared . It was only a couple of hundred yards away , right behind us and up a little grade , a long slope of beach plum and poison ivy , salt burned and scrubby . You could n't see a thing now , except gray . The land and the water all looked the same ; the fog was that thick . There were n't any Cokes . Just some bottles of Dr. Pepper and a lot of empties waiting in cases on the back porch . " Well , " my sister said , " let 's go tell her . " She meant my mother of course , and we did n't have to look for her very hard . The house was n't big , and being a summer house , it had very thin walls : we could hear her playing cards with my father in the living room . They were sitting by the front window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see out there : the sweep of the bay and the pattern of the inlets and , beyond it all , the dark blue of the Atlantic . Today there was nothing , not even a bird ,  |p118if  you did n't count the occasional yelp of a seagull off high overheadsomewhere . " There 's no Cokes , " my sister said . " Not a single one . " " Tomorrow 's grocery day , " my mother said . " Go make a lemonade . " " Look , " my father said , " why not go back to work on the dinghy ? You 'll get your money faster . " So we went , only stopping first to get our oilskin hats . And pretty soon , fog was dripping from the brims like a kind of very gentle rain . But we did n't go back to work on the dinghy . For a while we sat on the edge of the dock and looked at the minnowfleckedwater , and then we got out the crab nets and went over to the tumbled heap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We spent a couple of hours out there , skinning our knees against the rough barnacled surfaces . Once a seagull swooped down so low he practically touched the tops of our hats . Almost but not quite . I do n't think we even saw a crab , though we dragged our nets around in the water just for the fun of it . Finally we dug a dozen or so clams , ate them , and tried to skip the shells along the water . That was how the afternoon passed , with one thing or the other , and us not hurrying , not having anything we 'd rather be doing . We did n't have a watch with us , but it must have been late afternoon when they all came down from the house . We heard them before we saw them , heard the brush of their feet on the grass path . It was my mother and my father and Robert , my biggest brother , the one who is eighteen . My father had the round black compass and a coil of new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a big battery one . My mother had the life jackets and a little wicker basket and a thermos bottle . They all went out along the narrow rickety dock and began to load the gear into my father 's Sea Skiff . It was n't a big boat and my father had to take a couple of minutes to pack it , stowing the basket way up forward under the cowling and wedging thep119thermos bottle on top of that . Robert , who 'd left his lanterns on the ground to help him , came back to fetch them . " I thought you were at the McKays , " I said . " How 'd you get over here ? " " Dad called me . " He lifted one eyebrow . " Remember about something called the telephone ? " And he picked up his gear and walked away . " Well , " my sister said . They cast off , the big outboard sputtered gently , throttled way down . They would have to move very slowly in the fog . As they swung away , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out his compass and take a bearing off it . My mother watched them out of sight , which did n't take more than a half minute . Then she stood watching the fog for a while and , I guess , following the sound of the steady put-put . It seemed to me , listening to it move off and blend with the sounds of the bay  --  the sounds of a lot of water , of tiny waves and fish feeding  --  that I could pick out two or three other motors . Finally my mother got tired of standing on the end of the dock and she turned around and walked up to us . I expected her to pass right by and go on up to the house . But she did n't . We could hear her stop and stand looking at us . My sister and I just scraped a little harder , pretending we had n't noticed . " I guess you 're wondering what that was all about ? " she said finally . " I do n't care , " my sister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curious as I was . My mother did n't seem to have heard her . " It 's Linda Hollowayand Stan Mitchell and Butch Rodgers . " We knew them . They were sailing people , a little older than I , a little younger than my brother Robert . They lived in three houses lined up one by the other on the north shore of Marshall 's Inlet . They were all right kids , nothing special either way , sort of a gang , living as close as they did . This year they had turned up with a new sailboat , a twelve-foot fiberglass job that some/body had designed and built for Stan Mitchell as a birthday present . " What about them ? " my sister asked , forgetting that she was n't interested . " They have n't come home . " " Oh , " I said . " They were sailing , " my mother said . " The Brewers think they saw them off their place just before the fog . They were sort of far out . " " You mean Dad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Is that all ? " my sister said . " Just somebody going to have to sit in their boat and wait until the fog lifts . " My mother looked at us . Her curly red hair was dripping with the damp of the fog and her face was smeared with dust . " The Lord save me from children , " she said quietly . " The glass is twenty-nine eighty and it 's still going down fast . " We went back up to the house with her , to help fix supper  --  a quiet nervous kind of supper . The thick luminous fishcoloredfog turned into deep solid night fog . Just after supper , while we were drying the dishes , the wind sprang up . It shook the whole line of windows in the kitchen and knocked over every single pot of geraniums on the back porch . " Well , " my mother said , " it 's square into the east now . " A low barometer and a wind that had gone backwards into the east  --  there was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And it was n't more than half an hour before there was a grumbleof approaching thunder and the fog began to swirl around the windows , streaming like torn cotton as the wind increased . " Dad 'll come back now , huh ? " my sister asked . " Yes , " my mother said . " All the boats 'll have to come back now . " We settled down to television , half watching it and half listening to the storm outside . In a little while , an hour or so , my mother said , " Turn off that thing . " " What ? "  | " Turn it off , quick . " She hurried on the porch , saying over her shoulder : " I hear something . " The boards of the wide platform were wet and slippery under our feet , and the eaves of the house poured water in steady small streams that the wind grabbed and tore away . Between the crashes of thunder , we heard it too . There was a boat coming into our cove . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father and Robert . " Is that the motor ? " my mother asked . " Sure , " I said . It had a little tick and it was higher pitched than any of the others . You could n't miss it . Without another word to us she went scuttling across the porch and down the stairs toward the cove . We followed and stood close by , off the path and a little to one side . It was tide marsh there , and salt mud oozed over the tops of our sneakers . The cove itself was sheltered  --  it was in the lee of Cedar Tree Neck  --  but even so it was pretty choppy . Whitecaps were beginning to run high and broken , wind against tide , and the spume from them stung as it hit your face and your eyes . You could hear the real stuff blowing overhead , with the peculiar sound wind has when it gets past half a gale . My father 's boat was sidling up to the dock now , pitching and rolling in the broken water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rubbed gently against the pilings . They had had a bad time . In the quick lightning flashes you could see every scupper pouring water . You could see the slow weary way they made the lines fast . " There was n't anything else to do , " my father was saying as they came up the path , beating their arms for warmth , " with it blowing straight out the east , we had to come in . " Robert stopped a moment to pull off his oilskins . Under them his shirt was as drenched as if he had n't had any protection at all . " We came the long way around , " my father said , " hugging the lee as much as we could . " " We almost swamped , " Robert said.  |p122Then  we were at the house and they went off to dry their clothes , and that was that . They told us later that everybody had come in , except only for the big Coast Guard launch . And with only one boat it was no wonder they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and clear and a lot cooler . The big stretch of bay was still shaken and tousled-looking , spotted with whitecaps . Soon as it was light , my father went to the front porch and looked and looked with his glasses . He checked the anemometer dial , and shook his head . " It 's still too rough for us . " In a bit the Coast Guard boats  --  two of them  --  appeared , and a helicopter began its chopping noisy circling . It was marketing day too , so my mother , my sister , and I went off , as we always did . We stopped at the Laundromat and the hardware , and then my mother had to get some pine trees for the slope behind the house . It was maybe four o'clock before we got home . The wind had dropped , the bay was almost quiet again . Robert and my father were gone , and so was the boat . " I thought they 'd go out again , " my mother said . She got a cup of coffee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boats work their way back and forth across the bay , searching . Just before dark  --  just when the sky was beginning to take its twilight color  --  my father and Robert appeared . They were burned lobster red with great white circles around their eyes where their glasses had been . " Did you find anything ? " my sister asked . My father looked at my mother , who was opening a can of beer for him . " You might as well tell them , " she said . " They 'll know any-way . " " Well , " my father said , " they found the boat . " " That 's what they were expecting to find , was n't it ? " my mother asked quietly . He nodded . " It 's kind of hard to say what happened . Butp123it looks like they got blown on East Shoal with the tide going down and the chop tearing the keel out . " " Oh , " my mother said . " Oh , " my sister said . " They found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Have they found them ? " " Not that I heard . " " You think , " my mother said , " they could have got to shore way out on Gull Point or some place like that ? " " No place is more than a four-hour walk , " my father said . " They 'd have turned up by now . " And it was later still , after dark , ten o'clock or so , that Mr. Robinson , who lived next door , stopped by the porch on his way home . " Found one , " he said wearily . " The Mitchell boy . " " Oh , " my mother said , " oh , oh . " " Where ? " my father asked . " Just off the shoal , they , said , curled up in the eel grass . " " My God , " my mother said softly . Mr. Robinson moved off without so much as a good-by . And after a while my sister and I went to bed . But not to sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until we could n't stand that any more . Then we did a couple of crossword puzzles together . Finally we just sat in our beds , in the chilly night , and listened . There were the usual sounds from outside the open windows , sounds of the land and the water . Deer moving about in the brush on their way to eat the wild watercress and wild lettuce that grew around the spring . The deep pumping sounds of an owl 's wings in the air . Little splashes from the bay  --  the fishes and the muskrats and the otters . " I did n't know there 'd be so many things moving at night , " my sister said . " You just were n't ever awake . " " What do you reckon it 's like , " she said , " being on the bottom in the eel grass ? " " Shut up , " I told her.  | " Well , " she said , " I just asked . Because I was wondering . " " Do n't . " Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ navel right straight back to my backbone . The tips of my fingers hurt too , the way they always did . " I thought the dogs would howl , " she said . " They ca n't smell anything from the water , " I told her . " Now quit . " She fell asleep then and maybe I did too , because the night seemed awful short . Or maybe the summer dawns really come that quick . Not dawn , no . The quiet deep dark that means dawn is just about to come . The birds started whistling and the gulls started shrieking . I got up and looked out at the drippingbeach plum bushes and the twisted , salt-burned jack pines , then I slipped out the window . I 'd done it before . You lifted the screen , and lowered yourself down . It was n't anything of a drop  --  all you had to watch was the patch of poison ivy . I circled around the house and took the old deer trail down to the bay . It was chilly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a coat . With just cotton pajamas my teeth would begin chattering very soon . I do n't know what I expected to see . And I did n't see anything at all . just some morning fog in the hollows and around the spring . And the dock , with my father 's boat bobbing in the run of the tide . The day was getting close now . The sky overhead turned a sort of luminous dark blue . As it did , the water darkened to a lead-colored gray . It looked heavy and oily and impenetrable . I tried to imagine what would be under it . I always thought I knew . There would be horseshoe crabs and hermit crabs and blue crabs , and scallops squirting their way along , and there 'd be all the different kinds of fish , and the eels . I kept telling myself that that was all . But this time I could n't seem to keep my thoughts straight . I kept wondering what it must be like to be dead and cold and down in the sand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bumping you and the fish  --  I had felt their little suckingmouths sometimes when I swam . The water was thick and heavy and the color of a mirror in a dark room . Minnows broke the surface right under the wharf . I jumped . I could n't help it . And I got to thinking that something might come out of the water . It did n't have a name or a shape . But it was there . I stood where I was for a while , trying to fight down the idea . When I found I could n't do that , I decided to walk slowly back to the house . At least I thought I was going to walk , but the way the boards of the wharf shook under my feet I know that I must have been running . On the path up to the house my bare feet hit some of the sharp cut-off stubs of the rosa rugosa bushes , but I did n't stop . I went crashing into the kitchen because that was the closest door . The room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ softnessof steam : my mother had gotten up early . She turned around when I came in , not seeming surprised  --  as if it was the most usual thing in the world for me to be wandering around before daylight in my pajamas . " Go take those things off , honey , " she said . " You 're drenched . " " Yes ma'am , " I told her . I stripped off the clothes and saw that they really were soaking . I knew it was just the dew and the fog . But I could n't help thinking it was something else . Something that had reached for me , and missed . Something that was wet , that had come from the water , something that had splashed me as it went past.  |p126e  have lived here with our father for years and years . Joe , who 's the oldest  --  then Mark , then me  --  says he can rememberour other place real well : the house we used to live in , and the kitchen with yellow roses on the wall paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trees where you could lie on your back and watch the sun spin in the leaves . ( There 's no trees that big around here . ) He says that there was a high bluff where you could look down on a river that was twenty feet across . He caught crawfish in the pools there sometimes . Joe tells that our father had a whole pack of spotted hounds , and when they went hunting you could hear them for hours , our father shouting and the dogs fighting and howling . Joe says on nights when the moon was full the country was plain crowded with animals running . Joe says all of that  --  only thing he wo n't talk about is our mother . Now , I know we got to have had one , but Joe wo n't answer , and Mark , being younger , do n't remember more than some old black lady who took care of us for a while . Of course I do n't even remember that , being the youngest . For all I know , I never been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next door , sitting high on its foundations against the damp and the snakes . The highway , four lanes straight downp127from the north and straight off to the south , not a curve nor a bend in it . And all around everywhere , far as you can see , palmettos . Low and yellow green , and good for nothing except making fans . There 's a fair number of snakes out there and some mice and rabbits but not much else . You can see it  --  the scrub 's no higher than a man 's shoulder  --  and that 's all there is . Once Mark told me that if I climbed to the very top of the roof and looked to the west , I 'd see a big lake shining . But he was just fooling . All I saw was heat haze , and I do n't have to climb a roof for that . In one way it 's a good thing we do n't have our father 's hunting pack any more . The scrub 's full of sinkholes , and dogs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's what happened to Lucky  --  he was a dog we had for a while . He came off a Buick sedan  --  the people , they slowed down and threw him out a window . He bounced two or three times and landed on his back , but he was n't any more than scared . That 's why we called him Lucky . He was small and long-haired and he suffered from ticks during the spring and , ear infections the rest of the year Never was a time when both his ears stood up straight  --  always something draining out one or the other . But he sure did like running in the palmettos . And one day he never came backWe went looking , Joe and Mark and me , but there was to ( many holes and too much ground . We never even found a sigr of him . We had a cat too , you know that ? She got killed on th ( highway by a big semi , name of Beatons Long Distance MovingWhen Joe scraped her up with a shovel and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started crying . I really did love that cat I kept on crying until Joe and our father beat the tears out o me . They said it was n't decent . After that I felt different about the highway . Before , I uses to like it , especially the sounds : the tires whistling and singin on the wet , and hissing on the dry . The soft growling sound  --  kind of like a sigh  --  when some trucker tested his air brakes The way horns echo way off in the distance . The thin littlp128screech of car brakes , too , almost like a laugh . And something else  --  a steady even whisper . Day and night , no different . It ran along the whole length of highway , like electric wires singing . Or maybe kind of like breathing . And I got to admit that sometimes the highway was a pretty thing too . When the moon was on it . When quick summer rains fell and clouds of steam rose up and cleared away leaving just a heat mirage in the distance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ August day , those passing cars and trucks really stirred up a nice little breeze for you . But I did n't like the highway any more . Not at all . There just was n't no getting away from it . If I did n't hear it or see it , if I closed my eyes and stuck my fingers in my ears , I still could smell it . The different exhausts , gas and diesel . The smell of oil that 's burning clean and oil that 's not . The paint smell of engines overheating with the load of their air conditioners . Like Joe would say , the highway brought everything to us , and took it away too . Joe 's always been the religious one around here , the one who put a Bible on the top shelf in the kitchen . He used to read a little from it now and then . It was a comfort to him , I guess , specially after Bruce left . You see , when we first came here , there were four boys , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how he come to leave . Every December there was a big increase in southbound traffic . Out of that crowd there 'd always be some who 'd made the trip before , and who always made a point of coming back to the same places . Take this one car now ; it had stopped every winter for four or five years . It was a man and his wife and their girl . She got prettier each year , her blond hair hanging long and loose down her back . The last time the man was n't with them . They stayed quite a while , parked off to one side of the station , talking to Bruce . Afterwards Bruce was very excited : he smashed his thumb with a tire iron , something he do n't ever do . Anyhow , right after they left , he marked a date on the wallp129calendar with a big red star , and on that day he packed his clothes in a paper bag and told us he was going north with them . Then he walked across the highway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the road , putting his feet down heavily , as if they hurt him , crossing the wide median , kicking at the pine trees the state planted there . ( Funny thing , those trees , been there five or six years and do n't hardly reach to your knee . ) He waited a long time , swatting at the flies and slapping at the mosquitoes  --  they 're both pretty bad sometimes . Joe and Mark and me , we sat on the curb by the gas pumps and watched and waited with him . We only moved when a car came in . Then the three of us rushed to fill the tank , clean the windshield , and check the tires . ( I always checked the tires because I was the smallest . ) We worked so fast we even got a couple of tips . The sun got hotter and hotter . Bruce kept taking off his hat to fan himself with it , and now and then he 'd spit to clear the dust out his mouth . Along toward the middle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't get to go after all . " And he went in the house to tell our father . Minute or two later he was back . " He said it do n't matter none about Bruce . " Then a Mercedes pulled in , a 220 with special order extra green glass  --  made the people with their big sunglasses look just like frogs . They wanted diesel fuel , which we never had . " We may not make it , " the man said accusingly to us . Like we had let his tank run low . " We just may not . " " She wo n't burn gas , mister , " Joe said firmly . He figures he knows a lot about cars because he 's filled so many tanks . " How far to the next station ? " " I do n't know , " Joe said . " I never been down that way . " They pulled out very slowly to avoid wasting any fuel . With a shrug Joe moved the sign that said LAST GAS a littlecloser to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thatwe had to take in at night so the big trucks would n't backwindp130it over . It could make an awful racket in the middle of the night . All of a sudden the three of us remembered and looked across the highway . Bruce was gone . We never even saw the car that stopped for him . You 'd think we 'd be lonely living in a place like this . But we were n't . There was the cars stopping for gas . And once a week the company truck came to fill the underground tanks . That man always stayed to pass the time of day with us . Sometimes he 'd bring the newspapers , and he 'd always bring our groceries and take our order for the next week . We did n't ever go to town . Our father 's car was parked behind the house , next to the cistern , a ' 59 Pontiac . It was up on blocks , nice and neat , and the hens liked to nest under it . Used to be , too , that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U turn through the highway median . But we stopped going to school , and the big tracks filled in and grass grew over them . We had plenty to do what with running the station , and keeping house , and doing the cooking , and feeding the chickens , and hunting after their eggs , and repairing the roof , and keeping the screens patched . Our father , he did n't do anything . He was so tired that he could only sit all day long on the front porch . He used to chew tobacco , but finally he even stopped fooling with the plug . One day Joe and Mark told me he was dead . " You come see for yourself . " I 'd seen dead things before but never a man . Even so , just the way he sat there , head a little on one side  --  and the big blue and green flies banging away at the porch screen to get at him  --  I 'd have known by myself . That night Joe and Mark ( they would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far out into the scrub and dropped him into one of the sinkholes there . They took a couple of tirep131irons and a piece or two of rusted junk from the back yard  --  to make sure he stayed down . Nothing changed after his death . Joe went on signing his name on the receipts from the company . He 'd been doing it so long that nobody , not the driver of the gas truck nor the companyoffice , seemed to notice the difference . So , like I said , things went on , quiet except for that one busy season in the winter when all the campers and the trailers and the baggage-packed cars poured south over the road . " Look at that , " Joe said one day when four Pace Arrows and six Winnebagos passed , bumper to bumper . All the Winnebagoshad little Christmas trees in the back windows . " Do n't it look like something 's chasing them . " And that was exactly the way it looked : drivers scowling , staring hard ahead , concentrating on the road , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after that , Joe and Mark got in a fight . I did n't see the start ; when I walked in the kitchen Mark had a hold of a broken bottle and Joe had his knife out , the big switchblade he kept from our father . I could tell that Mark was beginning to have second thoughts ; he 'd have turned and run only he was scared of getting that knife in his back . He just kept moving in the general direction of the door . Me , I was too scared to say anything . Mark managed to back around the table , past the stove , and down the steps leading to the yard , pushing open the screen as he went . He had his left hand on the rail and he was trying to get down the three steps without taking his eyes off Joe . Well , we all knew that the railing was loose , been loose for years l guess , but neither Joe nor I knew that all you had to do wa$ pick it up . And that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tcp132the steps , Joe closed on him , holding the knife low and flat , just the right position . Well , Mark faked a stumble and Joe moved in . Joe was so busy watching the broken bottle he was n't paying no attention to Mark 's left hand . The long piece of two-by-two rail caught him square alongside the head . And he slid face down the steps into the yard . Mark watched Joe for a long time . But whatever he was waiting for , it did n't come . Slowly , in an easy underhand , Mark tossed the broken bottle at Joe 's back , the way you 'd throw something on a pile of garbage . The railing he dropped right where he stood . He came back inside , walked straight by me into the bedroom . He pushed the mattress off his bed so that the whole set of springs showed . He kept his special secret things hidden in a black plastic zipper case stuffed down in one of the center coils . He took that case , and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his bed , and his special clean cap from the shelf . " Cain killed Abel , " he said to me as he left . And , " The end of the world is coming . " You see that he was really the religious one in the family . He got a hitch almost immediately , a big truck with a load of cattle , going south . I never saw him again . Like I said , Mark used his left hand . I guess that 's why the side of Joe 's head was n't caved in . But he looked pretty terrible lying there , not moving , bleeding into the gravel , half his ear knocked off . I pulled him up the steps and inside ; took me a long time and I could n't hardly do it : he was a big man . I stopped the bleeding and kept ice on his head , but it was days before he came around . And then he could n't do nothing but talk foolishness and vomit all over the kitchen floor . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Exceptp133for the headaches and the limp in his left leg . That never did feel right , he said . Now I was really busy . I had to do the cars all by myself and of course I had to take care of him . That 's why lots of things that should have been done , did n't get done . Like the light bulb over the round orange sign GAS . I was n't tall enough to reach it , not even with our ladder ; Joe did n't feel like fooling with it ; and the sign stayed dark . I took to leaving the porch light on , so people could see where we were in all that empty stretch of road . I even found some reflectors and put them along the highway too . We got along , one season after the other . Just Joe and me . Then something changed , really changed . All of a sudden there was too much traffic on the highway . Now , it gets pretty busy during the holiday season , but this was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and this was the middle of the summer . The ground was shaking with their weight , all the windows were rattling in the back draft , like a storm blowing up . We 'd have four , five cars in the gas station at once . They were n't the usual crowd , wanting to get out and stretch , complainingbecause we did n't have a Coke machine or any rest rooms . They wanted gas and they wanted oil , forget the windshield , they wanted to be gone . " Something 's going on up north there , " Joe said . Nobody would stop long enough to talk . They were in that much a hurry . Pretty soon our tanks were empty , regular and super both . And the truck from the company , the one that always came on Wednesdays , it did n't come . So I took in the sign that said LAST GAS and leaned it against the house wall , and at night I turned off the porch light.  |p134Now  the traffic raced by us without stopping . And on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nothing wrong with them , they were just out of gas . The people from those cars , they 'd thumb a ride if they could . If they could n't , they 'd start walking  --  not talking , nor anything like that  --  just following the highway . Soon the roadsides were lined solid with empty cars , and then the left lane was closed completely by an eight-car smash-up . And then , well , then it began slowing down . Just as suddenly as it started , it was stopping . This upset Joe , really upset him . " I know it ai n't right , " he said . He got more and more nervous , and that brought on his headaches , like it always did . In a couple of hours he was limping up and down by the empty gas pumps , holding his head with both hands . All of a sudden he spun around , rubber heel squealing on the asphalt . " Now look "  --  he jabbed me right in the middle of the chest with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going too . Let 's get together right now . Before we miss the last car . " While his back was turned , I took off , running . There was this one particular sinkhole I 'd known about for years  --  I 'd found it myself . You could climb down into it ( limestone is nothing but layers ) to a nice wide shelf , under the overhanging ground . You were out of sight unless somebody happened to climb down after you . And I did n't think Joe was going to look for me in every single sink , not with the pain he had in his leg . He sure did look for quite a while . He yelled and he cursed after me for hours and hours , before he finally gave up . Even when I knew he was gone , I stayed hidden , just to be sure . I 'd rather met a coral snake where I was than run into Joe on the surface , mad as he was . So I waited a long , long time ; when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highway was empty and I thought : Maybe Joe really did get the last car . Maybe he really did.  |p135That  was yesterday . And there 's things I did n't think about before that 's bothering me now . Like , when I went to turn on the light , there was n't any electricity . And food . Joe left everything for me , but it is n't all that much . And the quiet . I 'm not used to the quiet . Nor the way winds sound in the dark , hollow and big . And most of all , being alone . I should have gone with him . Sometimes I think I 'll walk along after him , but it 's got to be too far . I climbed on the roof to look off that way ; I could see for miles and miles , and there was n't a single thing moving . And I wonder if there 's anything there either , in that direction where all the people were rushing . I sure wish I 'd gone with Joe . When the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out in the highway so they have to hit me or stop for me . I know that 's what I 'm going to do . If there ever is another car.  |p136It  began to rain . Holding her purse over her head , Carrie ran the last few steps to the Lafayette Bar . Steve was waiting at the same table , the corner table next to the line of open doors at the sidewalk . He saw her , smiled , and half stood up . She wondered how many times she 'd come here in the two years she had known him . Hundreds of evenings probably  --  whenever he finished his work at the hospital early enough . Rain dripped down her cheek . She shook her head violently , like a dog shaking his coat . She hated umbrellas and never carried them . Why could n't he ever come to her apartment ? Why did he always call her and say , " Want a beer at the Lafayette ? " She 'd suggested once : " I 've got a refrigerator full of beer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . " And I like that bar in particular . " It was a form of independence , she thought . Some men were like that . Were bred to be like that . A matter of pride . For them ... And for me ? She put that thought firmly out of her mind . It is a good relationship , that is enough . We have fun when we are together . And we are together so much . . . except for the last three days , she thought with a twitch of pain . " My parents are coming to town for the weekend , " he had told her . " They 've never been here before , so I got somebodyp137to do my work and I 'm going to take off and show them around . " She had not been invited to meet them , but that would be his independence again . What was between them was none of his parents ' affair .. . She wiped the rain spots from her purse and went to meet him , heels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He leaned over and gave her a peck on the cheek . Without having to be told , the waiter brought her a beer . He knew too , she thought . The rain was falling in thick gray sheets , straight down , the color of fog . All along Bourbon Street drainpipes began to rattle and sing as they dumped thick arcs of water out on the broken , uneven sidewalks . " And it never rains at night , " Carrie said . " Feel it turn to steam , " Steve said . Rain splashed through the line of open doors , ricocheting like bullets from the sidewalk . She could feel it on her legs , cool for a second , then a warm snaky line down to her ankles . She moved her foot from under the table and looked at it . " You getting wet ? " " Just looking . " " We can move if you want . " " No . " A raincoated policeman walked by , sloshing through the puddles . She leaned over and watched him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shiny black street . On the river a ship began blowing , urgent and mournful . In the corner of the bar , there was a record player . The bartenderchanged the record , moving with slow deliberation . He turned up the volume . " God , " Steve said . " What ? " " Vesti la giubba . " " Oh , " she said , " I was n't listening . " " You 've got the darndest habit these days . " " Like what ? "  | " Not listening . You just kind of disappear . " " I do n't mean to . " " Oh hell , " he said , " everybody 's got a right to be peculiar . " " I do n't . . . " She stopped . Do n't whine , she told herself firmly . On the river the tug hooted again , insistently . He cocked his head listening . " Maybe some barges got loose . " " Ridi , Pagliaccio . . . " There was a scratch in the record @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was sharper than she had intended . " Sure . Why should n't they ? " She shook her head , smiling again . " Just asking . " They sat quietly , finishing one beer and beginning a second . The same policeman sloshed wearily back along the walk . And on the other side a stray dog trotted along , hugging the wall , moving briskly . " Where do you suppose he 's going ? " " Who ? " " The dog . " Steve looked first at her and then out into the rain . " I do n't know , " he said , " looks like he 's heading for the docks . " " I can hear the ferries , " she said suddenly . " I can hear their signals just before they pull off . " " I would n't wonder , " he said . " It 's not more than two blocks away . " " Let 's take the ferry across the river . " " What for ? " " Might be fun . " " In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment and it was on the tip of her tongue to say yes . But finally , under the steady prompting of his eyes , she said , " No , I guess not . " " For a minute you had me worried . " " If we had a tree house we could go and sit in it , " she said softly  | " What ? " His new bottle of beer came and she watched him pour it carefully . " I meant to tell you , Steve , " she said , " I 've been looking for another apartment . " " What 's wrong with the one you 've got ? It 's so handy to everything . " " You mean you live two blocks away . " " Sure that 's what I mean . Unless you want to get away from me too . " No , no , I do n't . I 've even asked why you do n't move in with me . The apartment is big enough . Your three roommates could find somebody else to share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be my love . . . " Of course I do n't want to get away from you . I just do n't think I want to live in the French Quarter any more . " " How come ? " " It was great for a while , Steve , but it 's for when you 're young . " " You 're not that old . " " I 'm getting old . And I just do n't have the patience any more , not for the tourists and the queers and the Jesus freaks . " " No tourists ever come to this bar , " Steve said . " Just regulars like us . And that 's why I like it . Like a club , you know what I mean . Like progress has n't touched it . " The record ended . Lazily the bartender changed it . " Oh God , " Steve said , recognizing the first bars . It was the Intermezzofrom Cavalleria Rusticana . " I thought that was your favorite . " He made a face and did not answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begun . They listened to the small sucking sounds of bricks absorbing water . " Okay , " Steve said , " let 's go . "  |p140They  walked the few blocks down Bourbon Street to the high iron gate that led to her apartment . She fumbled for her key , then dropped it . He picked it up , handed it to her . " Sorry , " she said . " I was born clumsy . " She opened the gate , noticing for the first time how rust came off in great smears on her hand . " I wo n't ask you up , " she said , " I 'm sort of tired today . " Steve hesitated and she wondered if he was about to object . But he only said , " I 'll call you tomorrow . " It was very dark in the courtyard . The small lantern over the gate did n't penetrate the thick heavy leaves and the vines . She stopped once and peered down , then shrugged . The walk must be under water . She could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Here under the wide leaves of the banana trees it was still raining , a light continuing sprinkle . She looked up and caught a quick glimpse of the sky through a tiny opening . There was a star stuck in it , like a piece of ice . She climbed the stairs slowly . On one  --  halfway to the first landing  --  the sharp point of her heel jabbed through the wood , and she had to slip her foot free , bend down and jerk the shoe loose . In the damp under the trees and between the thick moldy brick walls , boards lasted barely a year . Her apartment was stuffy . She started the air conditioner , then methodically began to undress . Without thinking or desiringit , she hung her clothes away , brushed her hair , and gave her nails a quick buffing . The noise of the air conditioner bothered her , so she turned it off and opened the window . She took off the bedspread , folded it neatly , and put it away . Then she lay down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cry , but she told herself firmly that it was a silly thing to do , that it would only make her eyes achy and puffy and swollen in the morning . She said this quite a few times , and finally , just before she slept , she came to believe it.  |p141She  had been asleep for some time . And for a while she thought that the sounds were part of a dream . A rustling . And a scratching . For just a second behind the closed lids of her eyes she saw her father , sitting on the back porch on Sunday morning , reading , the newspapers rustling under his hands . She could see the colors of the funny papers . She could even hear the flattonedringing of the Lutheran Mission down the block . And she could hear her mother complaining : " He goes out in the yard in his pajamas . A big Tocko he is ! " Even at this distance Carrie smiled and whispered to herself , " And not for nothing is his name Tortorich . " She did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she did it was in terms of pyramids of fat , with a tiny head balanced on top like a rock .. . They had gone back to Ragusa while she was still in high school . The strange country had become too much for them , after nearly forty years . They were going home at last . They left her with a cousin , to finish school . At first , in the strange smells of her cousin 's house , she missed them . But when the year was done , and her cousin brought out the little savings book with her passage money marked in it in violet ink , she just shook her head . And she never went . Her parents wrote , once or twice , but then those letters stopped too . She rarely saw her cousin any more , ever since that day years ago when she had gotten her first job and moved into her own apartment . She 'd done well since then . She had a fine job and a fine future . She was sharp and efficient , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though she was nice looking , with a lush , full figure . It just did n't seem to occur to them . Until Steve came . They had gone to bed on their second date . That was a couple of years ago , when he 'd been a tall skinny medical student . He 'd put on weight since then . You could begin to see the outline of a very heavy man in the making . Like his father , he said . His hair was thinning too , rapidly ,  |p142though  he was just her age . Sometimes when she stood above him , she could see the skull all pinkish under the thin blond hair . She always looked away quickly . Outside her window the rustling continued . That would be in the garden next door . Somebody must be walking about down there in the bamboo and banana bushes , a tangle so thick that even the cats circled around it . She opened one eye and looked at the small green luminous hands of the clock : ten past one . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thick high brick walls of the houses , a siren wailed . It seemed to stop on the other side of the block . She paid no particular attention . Sirens were so frequent , you 'd be up all night if you followed each one . Now voices were coming closer , lights flickered on the ceiling . Oh hell , she told herself . And got up slowly and went to look out the window . She propped both elbows on the sill and leaned her chin on her hands . She looked directly down into five adjoining back yards , separated each from the other by the same thick brick wall that formed the houses . The two larger yards ran just under her window , met back to back at a wall edged by broken glass . Across the length of these and at right angles to them , were the three other yards , each of them with an almost identical adjoining cottage . At the farthest house , two figures with flashlights climbed out the dormer window to the gentle slope of the roof . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the police . She lit a cigarette , and pulled a chair to the window to watch . The rustling in the garden directly beneath her window had stopped . The police were exploring the second cottage roof now , even clambering to the top to shine their lights down the other side . A woman 's voice called : " I saw him go that way there , for sure . " And the police drifted slowly across the roof , looking like kids playing hide-and-seek in the dark.  |p143Carrie  thought : They guess he 's up on the roofs . But he is n't . He 's in the yard directly below . She bent forward until her head rested on the screen and she stared down into the darkness . The top of the leaves reflected the flashlights dimly . Under them it was still and dark . He must see me , she thought . He must see my cigarette . The police walked slowly back and forth across the three adjoining roofs , their shouts stretching across space like lines of wire , weaving a cage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Go around . " " He could be anywhere down there . " " He would n't jump down , " a woman said , complainingly . " Not from the roof . " " Lady , I saw one go straight up a brick wall , like a fly , and grab hold of a second-floor porch . " He must hear them , Carrie thought , but not too clearly down below the walls and smothered under the canes . But he can see me . He 's got to have looked up and seen me . She let her eyes move slowly around the five little squares of patios , let her eyes feel their outlines like tangible things . And she saw something else . In the fifth yard  --  which backed into the cluttered , overgrown one  --  a screen door scraped open . Her eyes , accustomed to the dark , made out the shape of a policeman 's cap . He stood leaning by the door , and the gray of his uniform blurred into the old wall . He seemed to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appear to hear anything , though the rustle in the canes had begun again . The man down there seemed to be dragging something . A big police searchlight flashed on . She blinked and shook her head , dazzled . The roofs were outlined now , sharp black and white ; the old uneven slates made jagged black shadows like teeth . In the reflected glare of the searchlight she saw the man below . She saw the back of his head and one hand . And all of a sudden she knew what it was he was trying to do.  |p144He  'd found something to stand on  --  in that garden it would n't be hard to find a rusted chair and a couple of wooden crates  --  and he was dragging them to the back wall . Twenty feet away on the other side the waiting policeman heard nothing . But he could n't miss someone who crawled over the wall and into that yard . The hand was reaching higher and higher . She noticed it was n't too steady or certain as it groped for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catch him and that 'll be all .. . It was n't anything to her . Nothing at all . She pressed her forehead against the screen , so that dust fell tingling in her nose . And she lifted one finger and tapped sharply on the wire so that a little rattling sound dropped out into the night . The hand jerked back down into the dark shelter of the bamboo . She said , in a whisper : " Back of you , look back of you . " There was no movement , no answer . " There 's a gate . You did n't see it . Then go out the alley to Dumaine Street . " A pause , a rustling , and a small rattle . The gate was six feet high , wrought iron with great squiggles of feathers and corn tassels . She saw a figure go over it like a cat , a large black cat , up one side and down the other , headlong . There was only a single grunt when he hit the other side . Like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her fingers . She dropped it on the sill and poked at it with her nail until it went out . Police now stood on the walls and turned their lights down into the overgrowth . One said : " He could be down there . " " That house is on Dumaine , " someone else said , " around the corner . " " You check it . " Carrie turned away from the window . She went into the living room , in the dark , and felt on the coffee table for her cigarettes . She smoked quietly , studying the tiny coal , lighting onep145cigarette from the other . When the phone rang , she waited a long time before answering . Steve said , " Where have you been ? " " Here . I 'm always here . " " You sound funny . " " I do n't mean to . " She yawned slowly . " Look , " he said , " I 'm coming over . " " I 'm sleepy , Steve . " " I 've got to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said listlessly . She sat , half dozing , thinking of nothing at all , until he came . It took him only a very few minutes ; he must have run all the way . " What 's going on out there ? " he asked quickly . " There are four police cars over on Dumaine Street . " " Yes , " she said , " I know . " " They 're checking the yard right under your window . " But he 'd be gone , she thought , that dark figure who 'd scrambled over the gate with such a hurt grunt . " He was n't a very good burglar . " " What ? " " They were chasing him and he got away . " " Oh , " he said . " Well , listen to me now . " " I helped him , but he was n't very good , really . " " What in God 's name are you talking about ? " She felt floating and pleasant . As if she had been drinking absinthe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caught . " " I want a drink , " Steve said . " You have any Scotch ? " " I do n't think so , I did n't know you were coming . " " Okay , whatever you 've got . " He went into the little kitchen . The refrigerator door slammed and the icetrays rattled in the sink . Words drifted across the front of her mind . As they passed she read them aloud . " Come live with me and be my love and we will all the pleasures prove ... "  |p146He  brought back two glasses . She ducked her nose down into the tickling of the risingsoda bubbles , played with the pieces of ice with her tongue . " Quit , " he said . " That 's too damn suggestive when I'mtalking to you . " She put the glass on the coffee table and folded her hands and waited . " I do n't know how you guessed it , " he said abruptly . " Me ? " " You acted so strange , I should have realized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small patch of yellow light over the corner lamp . She did not remember turning it on . Steve must have done it when he came in . " Look , " he said , " there was something else all right . " " What else ? " " There was somebody else with my parents . " " Oh . " " A girl . " That was it , she thought . So simple . And she had n't thought of it . She had n't thought of it at all . " I 've known her ever since high school . " The way he said it made her think of football games in crisp clear northern weather , and proms with all the dresses fluffy and pastel , like so many flowers . And everything cool and crisp like an air-conditioned office . . . The only high school prom she had ever been to had been hot and crowded and steamy with perspiration . Dresses streaked and wilted in the heat . Her net skirt stretched and sagged ; her heel caught and ripped it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she dabbed on it . " My parents have been friends of her parents for years . Before she was born even . " And do I have continuity like that , Carrie thought . Of friendships carried from generation to generation . Did my parents give me a single thing but my blood . . . " I guess they decided it would be a good thing if we made ap147couple . They had it all figured out . You know the way parents do . " A crisp clear world where boy and girl infants held hands between their carriages . . . She had n't had a carriage at all . She had lain on a blanket on the floor on the front porch , fenced in by chairs turned on their sides . " I did n't tell you before , " he said , " because I did n't know if you 'd understand . " " No , " she said , " I probably would n't have . " " She 'd been looking forward to coming , you know . It was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I guess so . " " Like what ? " " Dark hair , dark eyes . " " Oh , " she said . " I 'd have told you before only I thought it would just hurt your feelings . " " But you feel better now . " " Well , " he said , " yes . " " Are you going to marry her ? " " Now you are mad at me . " " I was asking . " " No , " he said , " I 'm not going to marry her . " " That 's a shame when she was counting on it . " She stared at the pink azalea on the table , thinking : If I had a wall I could climb over it , but I do n't even have a wall . I do n't have anything at all . She reached out and patted his head , gently , absentmindedly , like a child . " Go home , little boy . " She did not hear the door . After a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And the silence was no emptier than it had been with him there.  |p148S  andra Lee was late . It was nearly five o'clock when she got off the school bus . She walked through the narrow alley along the side of her house and heard the hollow echo of her heels on the brick . The philodendrons which her grandmother insisted on growing in the six inches of soil by the high board fence brushed crinkled leaves against her face , and she ducked her head to avoid them . I been doing this every day of my life , she thought , since I been old enough to walk . And how many times does that make it ? She liked to think of numbers . She always counted things . The walk now , it had two hundred and sixty-eight bricks . And then you were at the kitchen door . She climbed the worn wood steps , the ones her grandmother still scrubbed with brown soap every day , rain or shine , hot or cold . The way she had done ever since she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steps now were a silvery gray color , the veins of the wood standing up hard and clear , the surface rough and uneven like a washboardwhen you sat on it . She went in , letting the screen bang shut behind her . She knew who would be there  --  the same people were always there each day when she came home from school . There was herp149mother , short and heavy , dark brown and frizzled-haired , with only light green eyes to show her white blood . She would be standing at the enamel-topped table under the window beginning to fix supper , staring out at the line of fluttering clothes that ran from the back porch to the back shed . There was her aunt Norris , sitting in her wheel chair , across her withered legs the endless balls of cord she used to crochet . She went very fast , the shiny little hook squirming about among the knotting thread . So fast that the finished product seemed to run smoothly off the tips of her black fingers . And there was the old lady , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , back in the dusky part of the room , reading the evening paper under the light of the overhead lamp , her gold-rimmed glasses sliding halfwaydown her nose . She had gotten those glasses from a lady she cooked for years ago , back when her children were still small ; she found the glasses suited her fine and she had used them ever since . Now and then she would take them off , and stare at them , and you could tell that she was remembering back to those days when she was young . Most likely too , they would be talking when Sandra Lee came in  --  the soft , muttered Cajun French . They always spoke it during the day when they were alone in the house . It was the only language her grandmother felt comfortable in . English came stiff and hard to her tongue , she said . When Sandra Lee came , they stopped at once , for they would never speak French in front of her . She asked sometimes , but they only laughed and told her , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to go talking the old folks ' talk . " This was the same as every other evening . They stopped talking when they heard her foot on the step . They all looked up when she came through the door . Her mother asked : " How was school today ? " and she answered , " Fine , " and put her books down on the table beside her grandmother 's paper . Then her mother would tell her what to do : go to the grocery , or get the clothes in , or wash your hands and set the table . Today her mother said : " I wo n't be needing any help . Butp150you could put the hem in that dress I ripped for you this morning . " " Growing like a Jerusalem weed , " Norris said , as her fingers went back to their contortions with the strip of steel and the cotton thread . So Sandra Lee fetched the dress , and brought it back to the kitchen and threaded her needle and checked to see just how it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd you eat lunch with ? " her mother asked . " Some kids . " She began sewing , quickly , deftly . " Like who ? " " Well , Peggy , and Amelie . " " What they have for lunch ? " " I did n't look . " " Lunch now , " her grandmother said . " It used to be called dinner . When I was cooking we 'd have four or five courses and never think anything of it . Excepting it was crawfish bisque . I guess I picked ten tons of crawfish in my day . " " If John and the boys got them , " Norris said , " we could make some again this spring . " And then Sandra Lee said what she had been saving up to say all afternoon : " I 'm not going back . " They stopped whatever they were doing . They all looked at her . She could feel them looking through her . " I 'm not going back to that school . " She found she was speaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was last year . " In the little silence they could hear the rattle of dishes and the television set in the house next door . Her mother said slowly : " What do I got to tell your father ? " Her grandmother said : " Jesus Lord ! " " I thought you liked it . I thought you was happy there , " her mother said . And Norris said : " Alberta 's quitting , no ? " She knows everything , Sandra Lee thought . And she nodded.  | " And you plain do n't want to be the only little black chile in the school . " " God , God , " her mother said , chopping onions on the wood board with a steady , practiced thumping . Norris said : " Alberta 's a silly little ass . " " She quit yesterday , " Sandra Lee said . " She was n't there today . " " Was they mean to you ? " her grandmother said . " Did somebody say something to you today ? " her mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sandra Lee shook her head and began stitching in the hem , slowly . Norris smoothed the folds of her finished crochet work against her knee . " There 's more than what you saying . " " I do n't want to talk about it , " Sandra Lee said . Her grandmother cleared her throat and spat into her wad of tissue . " Since when do you come to be short of words ? " " Since now , " Sandra Lee said . Her grandmother 's little beady black eyes glared at her . " No mocking in my house , miss . " Sandra Lee bit her lip and began stitching furiously . " How do I got to tell your father ? " her mother whispered to the paring knife in her hands . Norris gave her wheel chair a quick little spin , the boards under the linoleum creaked , and she was at Sandra Lee 's side . She pulled the sewing from her hands . " You began out by talking , " she said , " now you finish up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they eat lunch with you ? " her mother asked faintly . " You said they eat with you . " " Sort of . But it is n't just lunch . " " How ? " Norris said . " Tell us how . " " Well , " Sandra Lee said , " if I go sit at a table that 's empty they do n't ever come and sit by me . But if I go sit with them , they talk to me and it 's all right . " " Lord of mine ! " her mother hissed her breath with relief.  | " What you expect them to do ? They been going there for years and you just come . And what 's it got to hurt you to go to their table and not them . " " Little jackass , " Norris said bitterly . And for a minute Sandra Lee wondered whether she meant her or her mother . " We thought about nothing when we was young , " her grandmother said suddenly , " beyond the color of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was going to be somebody to play the piano in the evenings . " " You just got to work harder , " her mother said , " no reason you ca n't keep up . You won the scholarship . " " I 'm keeping up , " Sandra Lee said . " I do n't have any trouble keeping up . " " You do n't want to be the only one , " Norris said softly . " Not the only black face all by yourself in all that white . " " I just do n't want to go . " " My God , " her mother said , " oh my God . " " Tais-toi ! " Norris said , forgetting . " You are more foolish than your child . " Sandra Lee looked down at her empty hands folded across her lap . " You are fixing to come running back to where you been , " Norris asked . " No ? " " I do n't belong there , " Sandra Lee said , " that 's all . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tell me . " " I do n't know , " Sandra Lee said miserably . Norris snickered again . " You belong in Africa , maybe ? " She held up the blue plaid dress . " You going back to Africa wearing this dress ? " Her mother chuckled and dropped the chopped onions into a frying pan . " I 'm just not going , " Sandra Lee said . " I wo n't , I wo n't , I wo n't , " her grandmother mimicked . " You going back , " Norris said , " because there 's no place else for you . "  |p153Sandra  Lee bent her head and was surprised to see the splotches of water fall on her hands . She had not realized that she was crying . " We wo n't say nothing about this , " her mother said , " not to your father nor nobody else . " " I been trouble all my life . " Norris looked at her withered legs . " From the day I was born , I been troubling others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " The Lord in his mercy , " the grandmother said . " But you now , you got two legs and a head on your shoulders , and you got no cause to be a burden . " " There 's eight more months of school , " Sandra Lee said , and she saw them stretch ahead like the shining curve of a railroad track , endless . " You going tomorrow , " Norris said as if she had not heard , " and all the days after . And when you come home in the evening , you . are going to tell us what kind of a day you had , and what you did at lunchtime , and all that you learned . " Sandra Lee had turned her hands over and was studying the insides of them , the lines and hollows . Some people , she thought , they could tell what would happen to you from your hands , that the mark of the future was there , all spelled out , if you could just read it . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us no more of what you 're thinking . " " No , " her grandmother said . " No more . " The silence was thick and heavy until her mother said , " There 's no milk for the morning , and I was forgetting about that . " " Yes 'm , " Sandra Lee said . " My purse 's on top the bureau . " Sandra Lee got up and walked toward the front of the house . She opened the purse and found a fifty-cent piece and , holding it in her hand , she went out the front door , the one that let directly onto the street . The bricks gave out their gentle sound under her steps . Thep154houses passed one after the other , misted and shaded by fear and misery . She felt the pressure of her people behind her , pushing her , cutting off her tears . She got the milk . For a minute she thought about throwing the bottle down in the gutter and running off in the other direction . Instead she looked at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walk , hugging the shelter of the houses . And so the moment passed , and when she looked up again , the other way was gone . The street in front of her had only one opening and one way to it , and her feet put themselves on that path , and she walked home . " How was school ? " her mother asked . Sandra Lee put the milk in the icebox and closed the door . " It was fine , " she said.  |p155There  were horses on the streets in those days . You could sit on our front porch and listen carefully and you could hear the plop-plop of the hoofs and the rumble of the iron wheels of the carts in town  --  a mile away . You might call our place a farm , though it had n't been worked in years . Not since the time I was three years old and my father moved out of our house and went to live in his shack back in the woods . It seemed to me once that I could remember when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember the time when the fields around were full of white blooming cotton , and the east plot had corn growing . Seemed I could remember a hog pen too , lower down , in the bog where the pitcher plants stuck up their green flowers in the spring . And a sow that ate her litter , every one , and my oldest brother getting whipped for his carelessness . But most likely I was too young to have seen my father . And if I remember my brother Dan yelling and running around the yard , without his pants , screeching with rage and fear , most likely it was my mother on the end of the switch . ( My brother Dan was a grown man when the First World War began , and working on the fishing boats down at Biloxip156Bay . He had never much cared for fishing , or farming either , so he volunteered . He married a French girl , whose name I do n't remember , and he was killed a couple of months before the Armistice . His wife wrote once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't send her address . And my mother worried the rest of her life about that little French baby that had her blood and carried her name . It was the only thing I 've ever seen disturb her . No . . . it was the second thing ... ) My mother was what you would call a driving woman . For fifteen years she made a living for herself and her eleven kids off that faun , scratching away at the ground like one of her chickens . Without my father that was n't easy , but I never heard her complain or say that she was tired . And only once I saw how scared she 'd been . But that was later . We lived in moonshine country , where most people had big fields of corn . Some of the corn went to the hogs and some of it went to the cows , but most went into likker . Practically every low swampy stretch that was wide enough and deep enough and tangled with old clumps of hackberry and poison ivy and swamp oak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort you could n't follow unless you knew where you were going . And at the end there 'd always be a little still . People would come from fifty miles away to buy the likker , and that was a long trip in those days . They came by train , the Smoky Bill it was called , to Plainfield and then they 'd rent a carriage or some kind of wagon and drive the rest of the way . Lots of people did it , and corn whiskey was just about the biggestbusiness for three or four counties around . There was even a special firm that came out from New Orleans and sold nothing but sugar  --  in any amounts , with no questions asked and no records kept . The business was that big . Every so often there 'd come a reform government in the state capitol , and you could see people drifting into town , casuallyenough . They 'd wander around asking innocent questions , and the stills would finish up what they had going and lie idle for a while.  |p157A  couple of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a Saturday evening when she 'd gone into town to deliver the pies she 'd baked . She had gone to the drugstore and as she was coming out , with me tagging along at the end of her primly long skirts and high button shoes , a man I 'd never seen before stepped up to her , politely tipping his hat . " Move off , child , " my mother said , and I went to the curb and stared up and down the red dusty street , waiting and trying to hear what they were saying . I could n't . I caught only the last words and those only because my mother lifted her voice , indignant . " I am not a Judas Iscariot ! " She stamped off down the street , her skirts swishing high around her ankles in her haste . Even so , my mother would have nothing to do with the moonshining business , though there was a nice spot for a still on her property and she had had offers . She needed money the worst way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She did n't countenance any hard iikker , legal or not . We were all brought up to believe that the devil was a tall red man with a pitchfork in one hand and a bottle of whiskey in the other . And there was quite a to-do when my brother Roger , who must have been about fourteen at the time  --  a big , strong boy with the beard of a man  --  came home dead drunk and passed out in his bed . My mother got the wheelbarrow , the one that still stank of the chicken yard , and dragged or rolled him out of bed ( by herself , though she was n't a big woman ) and carried him out to the front gate to the edge of the dirt road where there was a kind of little ditch cut by the rains . She dumped him out there , and left him , though it was a sharp night , with a little mold of frost on the ground . When he did come up to the house the next morning , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cripple , my mother only glanced up from the pot of mush she was stirring . " Morning , Roger , " she said . " You look like you had a bad night . " " Yes , ma'am , " he said.  |p158She  brought us up carefully . Her girls wore cotton stockings summer and winter if they wore any of the shorter skirts . And if they did n't have stockings they had to have their skirts ankle length . When you worked all day with chickens and walked the dirt roads , the hems got thick and crusted and heavy with mud and dragged at your feet . Once my sister Rosalie asked if she could n't pin them up just for a little while , one wet fall when the mud and bramble burrs were caking and scratching . My mother looked at her  --  looked right through her  --  and did n't even bother answering . And that was the last said about that . Maybe she was a little rough with the children . But maybe there was n't any other way for her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming , year after year , in early summer , June usually . It could n't have been easy for her , after our father had his vision and stopped working and took his dog and went to live in the little shed down by the spring , right on the east side of the swamp . My mother went down each evening carrying his supper on a tin pie plate . She would always leave us at our supper while she went down . She ca n't have stayed too long , because I remember hearingher come back , hearing the firm steady unhurrying tread of her heavy shoes . For all of her energy , she was n't a thin woman or a gaunt one . She was short , and inclined to be heavy . Her hair changed from light brown to gray , but her face was full and pink . Her mother had been German , and the blood in her showed . Even mud on her looked clean . Her children were dark , every last one of them ; they all took after their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of him . But she did n't give a sign , nor say a word . She kept on bringing his food and bearing his children . Not even my oldest brothers , Mark and George , knew exactly what happened . One day they noticed that they had con/siderably more of the chores to do , and their father did n't see to be home for supper . Like kids , they were n't really ve interested . They grumbled to themselves about the extra wor then they forgot all about it . Next they noticed what was ha pening to the fields  --  they filled with dry stalks that rustled the wind during the winter until even they fell down al blended into the mud and disappeared . And the fields turn , into stretches of open ground covered by creepers and gra the marks of old plow lines showing very faintly . It was maybe six months , maybe a year , or maybe mop before the boys discovered where their father was living . Th found his shack one day in early summer when they were hea ing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green trot The shack itself had been there for as long as they could remei ber , only now the walls shone with bright new tar paper . T roof had been patched with sheets of tin and around the wh ( thing was a fence of chicken wire . The boys tried to open the gate  --  they wanted to peep in t windows and see who was there . The gate was n't a very go fit and it had warped besides ; they were struggling with it wh a big yellow hound came rushing out . They recognized the dog . Their father 's . It was in wo shape than they had ever seen , ears cut by brambles and c ( tangled with burrs , but it was sleek and heavy . As if it 'd of lying around for a week and had n't been cleaned up after 1 last run . The boys stopped fooling with the gate , not because t1 were afraid of the hound , but because they were no ion ! curious . They knew who was living there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them go , and them not talking until they were a half mile c It was almost like they 'd been to a graveyard . They did n't go to the pond that day after all . Instead tl went over to the Tickfaw River and caught some catf though it was a longer walk and they did n't particularly 1 the taste of cat.  |p160So  that was that . After a while we children forgot he was there . And things went on just the way they had before . My mother baked , and we brought the cakes and pies and bread into town every Saturday . She made preserves and we 'd comb the country for wild fruit . From the first blossom we 'd know where the berry thickets were and we 'd start praying for a good dry spring so the berries would n't blight and fall off . There was one particular spot , a kind of swampy one , where the bushes had plenty of sun and their roots were always damp  --  we 'd be out before daylight , fighting the birds for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we 'd cool them by scooping up great handfuls of wet mud and smearing them on the spots until we got home . Then my mother would use a special lotion made of eleven different kinds of leaves and that would stop the itching . We helped with the preserving , too , watching the long lines of jars stretched out along the kitchen table and over the windowsills . And eating the hulls out of the bottom of the jelly bag . Usually food was n't any problem . There were plenty of wild greens and we grew a little garden too . Mark and George were good shots with the old Winchester rifle that hung over the kitchen door . The younger boys used slingshots . So we had deer and rabbit and plenty of birds : dove and pheasant and quail . All of us , boys and girls together , fished the streams for miles around . My sister Marjorie was very clever at spotting honey trees and we always had plenty of the sweet and faintly musky tupelo honey . But winters were hard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very cold , with little skins of ice on the ground and air so damp you felt you were swimming under water . The house was never warm ; the walls dripped moisture and the wind blew straight through . We put newspapers under the mattressesand newspapers between the blankets so that the whole night roared with crackling . Even so we went to bed right afterp161supper , two and three together for warmth . Sometimes seemed that there was a big lump of ice in the middle of n stomach that did n't thaw out until March . But mornings were worst of all . There were things to done and we had to be out doing , stumbling over our own fe because we were so sleepy . We all had our different ways beating the cold . Like my brother John . On Saturday mornin he had to kill and pick and draw the chickens that were goil to town to be sold that day . He had to work outside , in a spec little fenced yard , where a charcoal burner heated a barrel water . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he h added some improvements of his own , ones that saved h. standing in the cold , stamping his feet and waiting . He h one in particular that he was very proud of . When he had the throat , instead of throwing the chicken in an empty bar . to bleed , he grabbed it by the feet and swung it around his he like a lariat . The blood drained out faster that way , he said , a he stayed warmer with the exercise . Sixty years later I can s see him  --  red blood spinning out , splashing like a sort of hea summer rain on ground that was frozen hard into little ruts a hollows . ( He became a car salesman in Pensacola , eventual and never had chicken in his house . ) Once when my mother noticed him , she said quietly to one in particular , " That is a great waste of energy . " And la on she said to the kitchen sink , " I wonder if you could n't something with chicken blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way she thought . One day my father was gone . Really gone this time . My mother said nothing . You would never think anythi had changed . It was my sister Marjorie who came home fr ( hunting honey and whispered to us that the shack was emp and the door of the yard was standing open . That evening we were all of us dying to get out . We of ) did that at night  --  after my mother had gone to bed , andp162could tell by her heavy slow breathing that she was asleep . But not this night . This night she sat rocking , alone in the kitchen , only moving every now and then to put more wood in the range . We could hear the thump of the sticks as she got them out of the basket behind the door and the clank of iron as she put them in the stove . Then the rocker began its creaking all over again . We lay waiting , not even daring a whisper to each other , because she had sharp quick ears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a child meant . ( She was always the first to tell when a fox or a weasel was bothering her chickens too ; just the slightest flutter told her that . ) We could n't even creep to the door , because the old boards of the house would groan and sway under our weight . The foundations had needed repairs for years . So we stayed very quiet and waited , and one by one we fell asleep . We never did know when she went to bed . Or if she did . That same night the shack burned to the ground leaving only the fence posts . Pretty soon , in the damp and weather , those fell down and the brush covered it all up again . Until we were n't even sure any more just where it had stood . Days went rolling into weeks and weeks into years . I remember worrying about my clothes , beginning to wonder how I looked . Beginning to fret at the old-fashioned pier glass that was so wavy you could hardly tell if your hair was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my mother adding ruffle after ruffle to the hem of my dress . They were all different materials , and my sisters thought the effect was very gay . I thought it was horrid . I had my heart set on a bright blue cotton in Keating 's window . I can still see that dress , as plain now as the day I coveted it so much my stomach was shaky . I can see how it was displayed , pinned up against a silver-paper wall . But I ca n't remember what my littlest sister looked like then.  |p163And  I ca n't remember the name of the boy who made love to me in the cotton shed on the Turner place . ( My mother , being a practical woman , did not oppose sex before puberty for her girls . ) He was a tall thin boy , with a beginning mustache , though he could n't have been more than twelve then . I thought the mustache was terribly attractive . He lived on one of the places close by , and he came every evening . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night bird , a whippoorwill usually . Sometimes my mother would look up and say , " Those are the saddest birds . " She was too busy to notice that the call had an extra trill that no bird would make . He claimed to have learned it from an old Cherokee on the reservation at Wallace Falls some twenty miles away ; he said it was a war signal . I was impressed . War signals sounded romantic ; and so did twenty miles . He might just as well have said ten thousand , like the old songs ; I had never been either distance . They were n't very successful , those early tries , more full of hurt than pleasure . I was kind of glad when I became a woman and stayed in the house and the cries of the whippoorwillstopped . The next winter was unusually hard . I remember that my brothers could n't go hunting for weeks on end , because there were no shells for the Winchester . Instead the boys set snares for rabbits . There were always plenty of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winter . The walk to school was an endless trip of dripping noses and chattering knees . Until we finally gave up and stayed at home . It seemed long , even to us . But then it was over , and my mother was sending us out to dig sassafras root and making us drink the pink tea . And all of a sudden the sun got hot and the days stretched out and , kid fashion , we forgot that we had ever been cold . We ate the wild watercress that grew around the spring and dug the young dandelion shoots out in the old pasture field and carried them home in our skirts.  |p164That  was the summer Albert Benton began coming to the house . He was the foreman of a lumber mill in town , a short , squat , heavy-set man , with almost white hair and a face sunburned a bright red . He came every Sunday , wearing a suit and tie , with his white hair carefully combed . He always brought something for us kids : a bag of apples , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building a new room on the west side of the house . We were so excited that we just stood around and watched the Negro carpenter from town , until our mother chased us off with not so gentle swats . And every SundayMr . Benton inspected the week 's work very carefully , plank by plank . It did look kind of strange , all those new boards hung on to the blackened paint-stripped main house . After all , any sort of addition was unusual in this part of the world . Most people lived in a house until it was ready to fall down with termites and old age before they built another one a few dozen yards away and moved into that . Finally , one Sunday morning , my mother put on a new dress and gloves and a hat . " Elizabeth , " she said to me , " go find the children . " I scurried around the yard and yelled out over the closest fields , though I knew before I started that I would find only the littlest ones , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their prime and all my brothers had left before daybreak . My sisters were off hunting for field lettuce , which we called lamb 's tongue . They would n't be back until evening . I found only Marilyn and Junine and Jesse and took them into the kitchen . My mother looked at us . " Where are the others ? " " Out , " I said . She folded her hands in her lap . I saw , all of a sudden , how old and rough and hard they looked against the new shiny material . I could n't help glancing over to the net gloves that lay next to the little round bag on the kitchen table . And Ip165thought how funny it was that a man 's hands should wear lacy gloves . " Well , " my mother said , " they will have to find out later . " " Yes ma'am , " I said . " Yes ma'am . " " I am going to get married , " she said . " Mr. Benton is coming this morning . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were the words she used to tell us . Not " You 're going to have a new father . " No , she was a plain-spoken woman . He was n't our father and he would never be . She had simply found herself another man . Later that morning , Mr. Benton drove up  --  in a borrowed carriage this time  --  and got my mother and handed her in like a lady . We all stayed very quiet and listened to the hoofs on the dirt road . You could hear them for quite a distance , because it was Sunday and everything was very quiet . He was a hard-working man , Mr. Benton . He 'd be up early , as early as we were , joking with us over breakfast . Then off he 'd go to town and his job in the lumber mill . He kept his own horse in a lean-to he 'd built at the side of the kitchen , a small chestnut mare , a bit on the elderly side and quite a bit slow , but even-tempered and quiet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things began changing . That spring , first thing I noticed , there was a hired man out with a mule plowing the east field . After that came a couple of Negroes planting . One by one the fields filled up . Very slowly things got back to what they were when my father had lived with us . No , I guess they were better , a lot better . My father had n't ever been one to make too much money out of the farm , he just managed to keep things going . With Mr. Benton it was different . He had a paying job and an all-year one , and whatever the farm made was extra . He had plans for that too . " Do n't grow for yourself , " he was always telling my mother . " Grow for money and buyp166what you need . " That was a strange idea for us , because each of the farms around here always tried to be self-sufficient . Mr. Benton just laughed at them . " With money , " he would say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can see my mother sitting and looking at him , her full , smooth face coming alight with a kind of liveliness she did n't usually have . They got the house painted , and my mother even started a little bed of cosmos along the new front porch , the first thing she 'd ever done that was for beauty and pleasure and not for practical need . Then there was a young brown and white cow in the new pasture lot . My mother milked it herself twice a day and never let anyone else tend it . And each Sunday she and Mr. Benton went off to church , all dressed up , looking smug and fat and altogether satisfied with life . They even had their picture taken . That picture stood in a big gilt frame on the handkerchief table in the corner , the one that my grandfather had made years ago . Then something happened , along one fall when the rains that bring in winter had started . ( I do n't remember the date exactly . But Mr. Benton and my mother had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boys had left home to find their own ways : Dan to try his hand at fishing , George to work in a department store at Leesville , and Mark all the way to St. Louis for a job with the telephone company . I was pretty near finished with school myself . So it must have been a good long time . ) This happened one evening , late evening . It had been pouringsheets all day , but along toward the time of sunset it slacked off , leaving just a light drizzle hanging like heavy smoke . The wet air was beginning to turn a funny fishy color , a sort of silver . I was in the kitchen , helping with supper . I even remember that my mother was wearing a print dress and a big freshly starched apron that crackled as she walked . Everybody wasp167inside , too , in that sort of weather . There was a new kitten in the box just inside the door ; you could hear it mewing . My brother Jesse , who would have been nine or so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a man standing outside the fence , right in the road . " Nobody paid attention to him . So he stood in the doorway and repeated : " He 's standing still right in the road , looking at the house . " " Well , " Mr. Benton said , " maybe he wants to stay out in the rain . " Jesse hopped up and down on one foot . " He 's got a big old sack over one shoulder . " " Bogeyman , " my sister Marilyn said . " Tramps , " Mr. Benton said . " Must have got thrown off the cars over by Ellenville . " Nobody bothered to look ; they were more interested in supper . Marilyn and Junine , feeding the kitten in the corner , giggled softly , their heads close together over some private joke . I finished the dish of potatoes , scraped clean , and began to quarter them . Then I noticed my mother . She stood in front of the range and her hands held a wooden spoon crosswise in front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold whips when they stood and talked on the main street in town . She was staring straight ahead at the wall , where a line of pots hung . They were mostly new , and some of them were copper , burnished so that they winked at you . And some of them were iron , blackened and greasy , and some were porcelain , mottled like a wild bird 's egg . I watched , the point of my knife digging little holes in the potato I was supposed to be quartering . She did n't so much as move her fingers for the longest time . Then she said very quietly , so that you could hardly hear it over the giggles of the kids and the bubbling of the pots on the range : " Make him go . " Mr. Benton looked up , puzzled , as if he 'd heard a far-off sound and was trying to place its direction . My mother turned around and walked crisply over to herp168chair , the black painted rocker that stood right by the kitchen table . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particularly excited . She folded her hands over her stomach and began to rock , tapping her heels on the ground . And everybody stopped . You could hear breathing , and the whimpering of the kitten . It was like hearing the roof fall , this sort of quiet . She repeated : " Make him go . " Mr. Benton was on his feet now , scrubbing at the side of his cheek . " Do n't let him stand out there and look , make him go . " For a couple of seconds Mr. Benton figured out what she was telling him . Then he nodded to her and went out through the front door . My mother stayed in her chair , rocking the same sleepy rhythm . You 'd have thought she was perfectly calm , if you had n't seen her eyes . When we finally collected our wits and thought about going outside , there was just Mr. Benton standing in the front yard , looking off toward the east . The road was empty , what we could see of it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Who was that ? " " Nobody , " Mr. Benton said . " A tramp . " " Where 'd he go ? " Jesse said . " Where 'd he go ? " He made a quick move to dodge by Mr. Benton and dash out the gate . I suppose he had some idea of following after the man . But Mr. Benton grabbed him by collar and belt and swung him off his feet , carrying him on one side , the way you 'd carry a bag of meal . He gave a swing and tossed him up to the porch . Jesse landed like a cat , on all fours . " Kids , " Mr. Benton said , " get on inside . " And we went fast enough . My mother was still rocking , quietly . " He 's gone , " Mr. Benton said . " Who was that ? " I asked  |p169And  Jesse , taking courage from my question , asked , " Did you know him ? " " No , " Mr. Benton said . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was nothing to get scared about . " " He went away , " my mother said . " You said to send him off . " " Yes , " my mother said , and you could see that her eyes were coming back to normal . Mr. Benton sat down , slumped way down in his chair , solidly , so that he looked a part of it . It seemed to me that he had never looked quite that way before . All that was a long time ago , of course . It worries me sometimes , comes back to worry me . I suppose we could have asked my mother about that tramp , but none of us did , not even when she was an old lady sitting in a wheel chair , long after Mr. Benton had died . Just an old lady sitting on her front porch looking out across a yard that she had carefully planted in flowers . We did n't know . And we did n't ask . Sometimes we would think that it was . And sometimes we would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it that way.  |p170She  went to the observation deck to watch the plane take off , the way she always did . She watched it swing away from the loading ramp , windows like dots on its fat silver side . She tried to see into each window , trying to find a face , and could n't . The plane eased around and began the long lumbering trip down the field . The big jets had to go all the way back to the very end of the runway . When they swung into take-off position , their tails seemed to hang over the low barbed-wire fence . A small red private plane crossed overhead . The people next to her waved frantically , the children screeched , " Good-by , good-by . See you soon . " " He ca n't hear you , " their mother said . Their father said , " He better not be looking down to see you either . " They walked away . Her plane had cleared the buildings , and the scattered servicetrucks and moved upfield , a bit faster now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Another jet swung in behind ; like two ducks they waddled up the runway , their shiny coats gleaming in the smoky sunlight . She knew that by the time they reached the end of the runway she would have lost sight of her plane . She had never learned to tell one from another in that hazy distance . All the other times she had come , she had stood for half an hour in this ,  |p171same  spot and watched plane after plane take off ; that way she could be sure that one of them was his . And that he was gone . She did n't really know why she waited . It was just somethingshe did . Her eyes glanced from one speck to the next , trying to hold them in view for the seconds after they had disappeared . She tried to think of him up there , stretching , pullingout a magazine , settling back for a nap . Only maybe she was watching the wrong plane .. . Now there was a cluster of planes down at the runway 's end . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The top of her head began to tingle with the sun ; she pulled a scarf out of her purse . In the sharp gusty breeze she had trouble getting it on straight . She finally tied it loosely under her chin , letting it crumple crookedly across the back of her hair . In the plane , he would be relaxed . Flying did n't bother him at all . " Honey , when you 've flown as much as I have , and in some of the planes 1 been in , with people shooting at you , or thinking of shooting at you , you get to think that a commercial flight is like sitting in a movie . No storm is going to be as bad as that ground fire coming up at you . " " I 'm afraid , " she said , " I ca n't help it if I 'm afraid of a lot of things . " " When your number 's up , it does n't matter where you are . " " 1 just do n't think that way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business I have to . " Dust blew into her eyes . She let planes take off unnoticed while she blinked furiously . I 'll have to cry a tear or two , she thought . And that was very easy . Tears came so freely she had trouble stopping them . The piece of dust washed away . The haze and the planes were all the same silvery color . She squinted at them . And decided not to wait . Not this time . She turned and pushed her way through the turnstiles , climbed quickly down the flight of stairs . She marched into the lobby , her heels clicking purposefully on the cement floors.  |p172Then  quite suddenly she was very tired . Quite suddenly she felt the three or four nights of broken sleep , and tears , and the steady nagging ache in the center of her chest . The heart does hurt , she had thought over and over again . I always thought it was just a saying , but it 's real . Your heart can hurt . Now in the airport lobby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to tremble . The tips of her fingers tingled and burned . She stopped to look at them . A porter , arms full of bags , dodged around her . " Sorry , " she said . She would sit down for a moment . The chairs in the center of the lobby looked smooth and clean , their slick green covers were chilly with air conditioning . She sat still and felt the cool slip through her dress and disappear against her sun-hot skin . As soon as one spot warmed , she shifted her body to a cool one . Once she even moved to another chair . The trembling left her legs , and she could breathe more easily . " This is n't hot , " he said , " not like out there . God , I never felt a sun like that . Or maybe it 's the damp . And the funny plants . They got some vines out there , you 'd swear they reached out and grabbed at you , they kind of wrap around you . " Here were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bar entrance . Two children played tossing paper balls into the sand-filled pots and sailed a folded plane over the shiny hard green leaves . Now and then they stopped to get some more paper from a rack that said Catholic Literature Take One . " You 've done two tours of duty out there . Why should you do a third ? " " They 're short of people , honey . " " They 're always short of people . Why you ? " " I guess it 's like the submarine service . Those guys get a lot of sea duty , honey . More than they should . " " It is n't fair . " " Things happen like that . You got to expect things like that . " She smoothed her pink linen skirt across her thighs . Thep173building shook with the sudden roar of a plane . Funny , she thought , sometimes you did n't hear a plane and then sometimes you did . The wind must blow the sound around . Would he have looked down from the plane to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't there ? The way the planes were taking off , he probably could n't see anything at all . She kept on smoothing her skirt , getting each little wrinkle out of the linen , working at it carefully , inch by inch , as if it were the most important thing in the world . It hurts to worry this much , she thought . It really hurts like a cut , or a broken bone . It hurts more than my broken arm when I fell off the climbing bars in third grade . A lot more than that . It hurts so much that it ca n't hurt any more . " I 'm just scared , " she said . " I 'll be all right . I 've always been all right . " " Your luck 's going to run out . You ca n't get away all the time . " " I 'll be extra careful , honey . I 've got a lot of experience in being careful . " " You 'll get killed . I know you 'll get killed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her voice , ran in her head . She heard it echoing among the bony arches , vibrating the white tunnels . Killed . He was going to get killed . This time , he would die . She was so thirsty , her lips felt swollen . She would have to find a water fountain somewhere . She circled the lobby , then turned into the tile corridor that led to the landing gates . She kept swallowing , and each time her throat ached more . He 'd be killed . This time she knew he 'd be killed . She coughed , her throat was that dry . She could n't seem to moisten it . They said you were thirsty when you were dying . They said people screamed and begged for water , that was how you knew they were dying . Would he do that ? He never asked for anything . Not before . It bothered her sometimes that he never even asked her for a cup of coffee , he 'd just get upp174and fix it himself . Of course they had n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not in places they could call their own . There 'd been a lot of different hotels and motels , and then she 'd come back to her parents ' house alone . That was the military life , he said , always coming and going . That was what you expected when you married a professional . " I could go to Hawaii , " she said . " I could get a job in Hawaii and it would be closer for you . " " Hawaii is pretty bad when you 're alone . Anyway , it 's not so far back here , not with all the planes . I can always get on one of them . " " But I want to . " " You stay with your parents , and IT do the running around . " He never asked for anything . It was n't in him to do that . Maybe he 'd have learned if they 'd had longer together . She was halfway down the blue-and-yellow corridor , her heels clipping neatly . There seemed to be no planes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ empty , with only a leftover smell of passing groups of people . She asked a single blue uniform , " Do you know where a water fountain is ? I ca n't seem to find one . " " There 's one downstairs by the taxi stand , " the blue uniform said . " But the closest one 's right there in the Weather Bureau . " " Thank you , " she said , and walked toward the door he indicated . Then stopped abruptly . " Anything wrong ? " the blue uniform asked . " Change your mind ? " " No . " She pointed to the door . It said clearly : No Admittance . Authorized Personnel Only . " I guess I 'm not authorized . " He pushed the door open and held it for her . " I forgot that some people still read signs . Fountain 's right there . " She drank . The water splashed her nose and ran down her chin . She drank with little gulping sounds until she had run the water so long it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Slowly she lifted her head , took a couple of breaths , then duckedp175for a last taste . Finally she turned away , reaching in her purse for a handkerchief . He was still holding the door . " You really were thirsty , " he said . " I had n't had a drink for a long time , thank you . " As she walked down the hall drying her chin , she thought : Why did I say that ? It is n't true , I 've been drinking like crazy all day . " Do n't gulp so fast , " he said . " If you 're thirsty , I 'll get you some water . " They were sitting in the bar , the dark cool bar with its softvague music , wasting the few minutes before his flight left . " I do n't want you getting drunk when I 'm going to have toleave. 1 'd worry about your driving home . " " I 'm just thirsty , that 's all . " " Drink water , " he said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurt you . " She went back to the lobby , found her old seat taken , and chose another , facing a high arched window and a fuzzy graywhitesky . " Good-by , honey , " he said . " Take care of yourself . " She kissed him briefly . " Be careful . " But he would n't be . She began smoothing the skirt across her lap again . He 'd pushed his luck too far . He would n't be back . The pain inside her chest told her . He was dead , it was only a matter of the exact date .. . She looked down at her hands which had stopped moving and lay palms up on her lap . You always know , she thought , when to begin grieving . The plane was n't yet six hundred miles away and she was sure . Her hands reminded her of boats drawn up on the sand , boats tipped over and dry , waiting for the tide . And she was thirsty again , so thirsty . When she got home she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it right to the top with ice tea . That 's what she 'd do as soon as she got there . But first she 'd have to catch her breath . She was reallyp176very tired , she had n't had enough sleep in a long time , three or four or five nights , ever since she had come to realize that he was going off to die . He laughed at her . " What do you want me to do , honey ? Desert ? Like in the movies ? " " We could go to Mexico . " " They 'd catch us in Mexico . " " Well , there 's got to be some place , if we changed our name . " " Honey baby , I 've got to go back . " " You want to go back , " she said bitterly , her tears a nasty salt in the corners of her mouth . " You really want to go back to the fighting . " " You 're wrong , honey , " he said quietly . His brown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I just do it . " She would rest a bit and then she 'd get her car out of the parking lot and drive home and have supper with her parents and watch television with them . Just not yet . She just was n't ready yet . She must have stayed too long on the observation deck , her head was still burning . When she was a child , she 'd spent hours sun-bleaching her hair to the color of straw , but she could n't seem to take that much heat any more . The big high window got too bright and too shimmering . She looked away , blinking . There was somebody sitting next to her , a blue uniform was asking , " Do you feel all right ? " She had talked to a blue uniform in the corridor , was this the same one ? She had n't looked at a face out there , she had n't thought to . " Of course I 'm all right , " she said . " I 'm just tired and I stood in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little pale . " " Were you the man I talked to over there , who showed me the water fountain ? " " Yes ma'am . " " I was so thirsty . "  | " Maybe you did have too much sun . It 'll do that , they tell me . " " I 'll be all right . I 'm always all right . I was just resting before I drove home . " " You 'd better , " he said . He had curly gray hair and a round face , a mouth that was too small and cheeks that were too heavy . A pleasant sort of face , the sort of face that would be easy to forget . She lifted the hair up from the back of her neck , pushed it behind her ears . She seemed to be perspiring heavily . She took a handkerchief from her purse , found it damp and began flappingit in the air to dry . " Here , " he said , " use mine . " She hesitated and then accepted . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blotted carefully . The cloth smelled faintly of something  --  a flower or something like lavender . She could n't quite place it , it was so vague . " Thank you . I can go home now . " She stood up and big black spots spread over everything until there were only little cracks of light and she peeped between them . For a minute she thought the light would wink out completely , but that time passed . " It would be criminal to let you get in a car . " He was holding her arm tightly . " You 're not drunk so you 've got to be sick . " She was still swaying a bit . " I almost fainted , did n't I ? " " You came pretty close . " " How silly . " " Look , " he said , " why do n't you come have a cup of coffee with me before you try to drive ? " She hesitated , wordlessly . " Look , " he said , " I 've got a wife and two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while ago and I 'm going to take one out tomorrow . I meant coffee right there , over there in the bar where we can sit down because I do n't want to drink it standing up and holding you up too . "
