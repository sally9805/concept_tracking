Everyone knows that Gone With The Wind is the most popular movie in the history of America . Since it was made thirty-five years ago , an estimated 150 million people have seen it . But try to guess what film is the second most popular in American viewing history . Not The Sound of Music , or Airport , or Rosemary 's Baby , but Brian 's Song , the story of a young football player who dies of an incurable illness . Do n't try to remember it flashing on your theater marquee , because it never played there . And it did not get its over 100 million viewers from theater showings across the country for a generation . Brian 's Song showed exactly twice , each time before an audience of about 53 million people . It was , of course , a movie made for television , and those movies , as far as the American viewing public is concerned , are the only movies that count . The raw statistics are staggering . Using the narrowest possible definition of a " movie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many Americans watch movies made for television each week as view movies playing in local theaters . In fact , in an average week more time will be spent watching one movie in one television showing than will be spent watching all the movies in all the theaters in America in one week ! An average movie made for television , without any special billing or advertising or big-name stars , and without even a particularly extraordinary subject , can and will get 24 million viewers in one showing . In 1973 , only five movies shown in theaters got over 20 million viewers . And 1973 was an extraordinarily good year for theater movies . If a television movie has a particularly arresting theme  --  and most of them try to  --  the viewing audience will soar . Audiences of more than 40 million are commonplace for first-run made-for-television movies . In the entire history of theatrical movies , there are no more than two dozen which have ever had audiences of that size . What kinds of movies are made for TV ? The answer is all kinds . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , magic , even homosexuality . The movies are made exclusive- ly to be shown on television in America , although they are sometimes seen on theater screens in other countries . Most TV movies are made in Los Angeles and , in fact , close to half of them are made by one company , the entertainment giant , MCA , Inc . ABC shows the most television movies by far . It has at least two on each week , and sometimes as many as six . ABC , in fact , makes many of its own movies . NBC has the second most , but trails far behind ABC . CBS has the fewest . The films are almost always shown on evening prime time , although ABC has recently started showing movies made for television between the school and dinner hours . These " After School Specials " are aimed at school-age children . Many television movies have continuing characters . NBC , for instance , has the hottest movie series on the air with the NBC Sunday Mystery Movie . It is a rotating series featuring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and " Hec Ramsey . " " Colombo has the highest number of different people watching it each week of any show on television  --  about 41 million on the average . Other movie series with continuing characters , such as " Shaft " and " Tenafly , " have been less successful and are no longer on the air . CBS uses its television movies frequently as pilots for a series which will come later . The Marcus Nelson Murders , for instance , was the pilot for the immensely success-ful " Kojak " series , starring Telly Savalas . Most of the made-for-television movies , however , feature nonrecurring characters . Movie reviewers rarely give much notice to these movies , but because they have a fascinating ability to tell what is on the American mind , they are fast becoming an authentic art form . If there is one consistent quality of these films it is topicality . The reason is that TV movies are so quickly and cheaply made . For example , when Deliverance was hailed by critics and audiences , it was almost inevitable that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few months later there appeared on television Pray for the Wildcats , a story of a group of business executives who try to rough it in the wilderness and find the wilderness bringing out the wildness in them . More people saw Pray for the Wildcats in its one showing on ABC in January 1974 than have breaking consistency in television shows and movies , including " Mannix , " " Toma , " " Hawaii Five-0 , " and others . In real life , the Vietnam veterans showed far less psychological stress than World War II and Korean veterans . Television movies are a vehicle for the imagination and fantasies of the moviemaker to run wild as long as they retain some connection with real-life fears . A favorite theme is the runaway daughter of middle-class parents who gets into drugs and thence into big trouble . These shows have a special appeal to producers because sex is almost always mixed in with the drug use . In Go Ask Alice , for example , viewed by 40 million in its first showing , a fourteen-year-old girl seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in theaters throughout the country . Movies on television are still reverberating with echoes and imitations of Rosemary 's Baby . Indeed , witchcraft and sorcery have become the staple of the television movie . ABC has an entire series of movies , the ABC Suspense Movies , which focus almost exclusively on the bizarre and occult . But while the movies on television imitate other movies , they imitate life even more , or at least what the television writers think life is . There have been , for example , many movies dealing with the return of the Vietnam war soldier . Welcome Home , Johnny Bristol was only one of these . It portrayed Michael Landau as a P.O.W. who had been held captive by the Vietcong and returned to America to find that his home town had vanished completely . After a great deal of coming and going , Landau learned that he had been insane while in the Vietcong 's hands , and had fantasied his boyhood , remembering a happy rather than miserable existence . Welcome Home , Johnny Bristol reflects a typical reaction to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ viewers the Vietnam war had seemed insane , the writers assumed that people returning from the war would be insane . The same theme appeared in a videotaped adaptation for television of an off-Broadway play  --  Sticks and Bones  --  about a Vietnam veteran who returns from the war not only non compos mentis but also blind . His family eventually succeeds in convincing him to kill himself . The theme of the tormented Vietnam veteran has been picked up now and appears with heartruns away from home after becoming deeply involved with drugs . On the road , of course , she turns to prostitution to support her habits . In Death of Innocence , Shelley Winters agonizes over the wayward life her drug- and sex-involved daughter is leading in the big city . Almost 45 million people saw it in its first showing . But two lingeringly hypnotic themes in the fantasy life of American writers have provided the biggest smash hits for made-for-TV movies . The idea for the first one was pure genius . It was a combination of every tear-jerking theme except a boy and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the friendship between a black and a white football player . Based on a true story , the movie shows them competing , becoming friends , going to the professional leagues , then becoming closer than ever as the white player becomes terminally ill with a metabolic disease . The film , Brian 's Song , in its two showings brought tears to more than half of the households in America . The second theme , The Night Stalker , which covered many of the bases and drew a huge audience was about , of all things , a vampire terrorizing Las Vegas . The film , the second most popular television film ever , drew almost 90 million people in its two showings . The vampire was a wonderfully American vampire . His victims were go-go girls with white boots and girl blackjack dealers . After he had drained their blood , he threw them from a freeway onto a dry spillway . When he needed a particularly large volume of blood , he simply took it from a blood bank . The film 's ending is the best of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his lair and drives a stake through his heart , the police burst in and arrest him for murder . The catch is that they release him when he promises never to discuss the subject with anyone . The police and the mayor are afraid that rumors of vampirism might hurt the tourist business ! One of the most successful films made for television was about a subject rarely discussed in television movies  --  homosexuality . That Certain Summer was the story of a boy who finds out that his father is a homosexual . Luckily , his parents are divorced . On a lengthy visit to his father , however , he sees him living with another man . The boy and his mother become terribly upset , but the movie is definitely slanted to heap sympathy upon the homosexual and a pitiful scorn upon those who are not understanding of the problem of homosexuality . The boy 's mother is played as shrewish and demanding . When her former husband asks , " It would be all right if I were living with a woman , would n't it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ) were a woman , I 'd know how to compete . " In the end , however , they are reconciled . The movie , despite what some might consider its unusual slant , drew well over 40 million viewers on its maiden voyage . Interestingly enough , when made-for-television movie pro ducers are asked about the artistic quality of their movies , they unerringly cite That Certain Summer as an example of a great television movie . Even the most thoroughly hooked television addict will rarely rave about any television movie the way people rave about movies shown in theaters . On the other hand , it is impossible to leave your living room feeling quite as gypped as you can when you leave a theater at which you have just paid $3.50 per ticket to see a disappointing or worthless film . There is a certain flatness about television movies which is extremely difficult to pinpoint but is certainly there . Characters in these movies are rarely even vaguely reminiscent of real-life people . They are more similar to the other characters on television than they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems as if the development of characters on television is similar to the evolution of mankind . The lowest form is on early in the morning , with cartoon characters utterly lacking in humanity . The next stage up the evolutionary ladder is the afternoon soap-opera character , vivid , but vividly unlifelike . The next stage is the character on the continuing drama , first stretching toward lifelike qualities . And still farther up , about parallel to the larger apes , is the character in the movie made for prime-time television . For some reason which is truly inexplicable , characters in a two-hour television movie can not be made as lifelike as characters in a ninety-minute movie at a theater . The reason may lie in the area of economic restraints . A television movie costs a small fraction of what a theatrical movie costs . Generally a theatrical movie costs about $2 million , while a movie made for television rarely goes above $400,000 . That means there must be all kinds of economizing in the purchase of scripts , in the length of time for shooting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result , all too often , is an elongated television series episode rather than a shortened movie . The changes and revelations of character which mark the good theatrical movie are almost always missing . The climaxes and suspense of the theatrical movie are also almost always lacking in the movie made for television , perhaps as a result of breaking up the movie into seven-or eight-minute segments with advertisements in between . The plots are too often formulized , expanded versions of hourlong television shows . Television movies , as a whole , are not yet new movie form . They are much closer to a television series form . There are exceptions ; some movies made for television are an art form unto themselves . Mark Carliner , widely recognized in television circles as an unusually creative producer of television movies , insists that the most meaningful comparison of television movies is not with large budget films at " I 'm just a sweatshirt guy who 's got to keep running at top speed to stay almost even , " says Jae Garagiola with a modesty that is likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former major-league catcher is fast gaining a reputation as the " Will Rogers of the Sports Set " Possessing one of the most finely tuned senses of humor in sports annals , Garagiola always seems capable of corning up with a quip to fit any situation . Highly in demand as a banquet speaker or master of ceremonies for many years , Garagiola became a familiar figure in most American households as a result of his regular appearances on the " Today " show aired over the NBC television network . On that show , he also demonstrated marked ability as an interviewer of the great and near-great , whether they came from the field of sports or some other line of work . He gave up his role on the show in 1973 but still does frequent sports work for NBC . The tale behind the appearance of " Poor Joe 's Almanac " in the Post is a story in itself . Garagiola was making a recent appearance on the Jack Paar show . Among his fellow guests were David and Julie Eisenhower . David , at the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Joe started " needling " David about how he should get more humor into his sports columns , and jokingly offered to come up with some ideas . David is a full-time law student now , but Julie , our associate editor , decided to take Joe up on his offer and asked him to write a humorous sports article for the Post . The result is " Poor Joe 's Almanac " on pages 46 to 49 . We hope his readers will enjoy it and laugh out loud . In it Garagiola has unearthed the top sports quotes of the last five years . They come from the lips of athletes ranging from famed Yankees slugger Mickey Mantle to a high school youth who set a somewhat obscure world 's record for sit-ups . Garagiola himself was widely acclaimed for always seeming to be able to come up with the appropriateline to to describe happenings on the diamond . Joe has made baseball more interesting and more understandable to the American housewife , who is in the position of becoming something of a captive audience when her husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He is not given to the type of high-blown utterances which are mouthed by some commentators who try to make a mysterious religion of the game . Garagiola has a happy faculty for getting to the bone  --  or the bonehead  --  of the matter . Born in St. Louis February 12 , 1926 , Garagiola was the son of an immigrant bricklayer . He grew up in the " Italian Hill " section of St. Louis and was graduated from South Side Catholic High School . His formal education ended there . Garagiola played nine years in the major leagues and had a respectable career batting average of .257 . He played on two pennant-winning teams . In 1946 , he tied a World Series record by getting four hits in one game . He retired in 1954 , having gained a reputation for a great sense of humor . His uproarious stories and general aplomb at sports banquets attracted such favorable comment that he was signed to do color commentary in 1955 on the telecasts of his old team , the Cardinals . From there , he rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then to the New York Yankees ' radio and television staff . A guest shot on the " Tonight " show when Paar was doing it gave him another boost that eventually led to the " Today " show . Garagiola was a fixture there for more than five years until early 1973 , when he decided to switch to a slower pace . ( He had to catch a 4:30 a.m. train from his home in suburban Scarsdale , New York , in order to get to the NBC studio in Rockefeller Center and do his preparation for the " Today " show . ) He made a considerable impression on his co-workers . Al Morgan , a producer on the show , broadened Joe 's role from sports announcer to all-purpose interviewer and commentator . " Joe has a marvelous quality of cutting through the malarkey from pundits and pretentious writers by asking the questions viewers want to hear . He 's a very bright guy who does his homework .

" She bowled me over with her charm , " said Garagiola of the eightyone-year-old poet . We think that you will find material in " Poor Joe 's Almanac " of ten-strike quality , too . vs
