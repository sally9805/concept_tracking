Like other suburbanites , most citizens of Cleveland 's Shaker Heights just love dogs-their own , that is . Other people 's merely make messes . Those who own no dogs find their scat a common danger to the unwary footstep and an offense to the wandering eye . After receiving 82 complaints in one month , Shaker Heights ' city council finally approved an ordinance which declares that " no person being the owner or in charge or control of any dog shall allow or permit such dog to commit a nuisance " on any public or private property without the property owner 's permission . Offenders would be subject to fines of up to $500 , six months in jail , or both . Shaker Heights now has the problem of enforcement ; no arrests have yet been made , but some dog-owners are now following their pets around with scoop and broom . - <P> Every morning and evening , five days a week , commuters to San Francisco take to their cars and turn the roads leading to the city 's two big bridges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week , discarding the usual answer of building more bridges , the state 's division of Bay Toll Crossings acted to attract fewer cars . As an experiment , two lanes on the Bay Bridge from Oakland were reserved for cars carrying three or more riders . Such car pools pass through its toll booths free during morning rush hours ; otherwise the daily 500 fare is collected . The experiment , which will last indefinitely and cost the state $160,000 a year , should save commuters in car pools $20 a month and keep about 1,500 cars out of town each day .
