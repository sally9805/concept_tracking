The drop in energy demand caused partly by the world recession , as well as the nine-month price freeze declared by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries , has given the U.S. a brief respite from the energy crisis-a few months of abundant supplies and stable , though high prices . The nation should have used this period to plan strategy for freeing itself of its dangerous dependence on foreign oil . Last week it became painfully clear that the nation has instead fallen asleep in the eye of a storm . On Oct. 1 , oil prices will almost certainly take another jolting jump , and the rise will apparently catch the country still without any energy policy worthy of the name . The week 's developments : <P> <P> OPEC met in Libreville , Gabon , and put on the record what was already obvious : it will " readjust " ( meaning raise ) oil prices again when the freeze ends Sept. 30 . The 13-nation cartel named no figure , but President Ford reacted to nervous speculation that the increase would amount to $2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price of $10.46 per bbl. for the key grade of crude . Such a boost , said the President , would be " totally without economic justification . " <P> The cartel voted also to quote oil prices not in dollars but in Special Drawing Rights-a type of global bookkeeping money created by the International Monetary Fund . The effect could be to inflate the dollar price of oil even more . The worth of an S.D.R. is based on an average of the value of 16 major currencies , including the dollar ; lately the value of the dollar has been falling against most of the other currencies and thus against that of the S.D.R. If that slide continues , more dollars will be needed to equal an S.D.R.-or buy a barrel of oil . <P> Oil-exporting nations contend that they need a big price boost because Western inflation and the decline in the dollar have eaten away the purchasing power of the greenbacks that they receive by selling oil . In France , for example , the purchasing power of their dollars has dropped roughly 30% in the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of a decline in the value of the dollar against the franc . This argument , of course , overlooks two screamingly obvious facts : a quintupling of oil prices since October 1973 has left the OPEC nations far ahead of the game , and the oil price boosts have mightily helped to fan the Western inflation about which they complain . Indeed , OPEC 's plans reflect raw economic power ; given their control of 68% of the world 's proven oil reserves , the nations in the cartel can set prices just about anywhere they choose . <P> A Gutted Bill . The threat of another price increase should have moved the U.S. to take stern measures to conserve oil . Just the opposite happened last week . Acting irresponsibly , the House gutted an energy bill .
