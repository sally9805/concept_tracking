THE HOSPITAL <P> Directed by ARTHUR HILLER <P> Screenplay by PADDY CHAYEFSKY <P> SUCH GOOD FRIENDS <P> Directed by OTTO PREMINGER <P> Screenplay by ESTHER DALE <P> Doctors are butchers . Hospitals are abattoirs . Patients are lucky to get away with their lives , never mind their good health . These are more or less the notions behind these two films , both of which purport to be comedies . The medical profession is eminently ripe for a good dissection , but the satire is laid on here with all the clumsiness of an intern at his first operation . <P> The Hospital shares little but garrulousness with the kind of Bronx homespun that made Screenwriter Chayefsky 's reputation ( Marty , The Bachelor Party ) . It has more in common with the dyspeptic humor of Chayefsky 's The Americanization of Emily , a clubfooted send-up of war heroes . It even has the same director , Arthur Hiller , who last holiday season took the medical profession rather more seriously in Love Story . <P> When the situations are easy , the laughs are there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while a hospital official tries to determine their Blue Cross number , some nut wandering the hospital corridors knocking off staff and patients . <P> It is when things wax serious , as they often do , that Chayefsky and Hiller choke on their own message : moral responsibility is needed not only to guide lives but to save them as well . Anyway , George C. Scott is on hand to make things bearable , and sometimes more than that . He is such a consummate actor that he can even handle Chayefsky 's dialogue , which rightfully should be engraved for posterity on a plaque made of chicken fat . <P> Such Good Friends has something to do with the racy Lois Gould bestseller about a woman ( Dyan Cannon ) whose husband ( Laurence Luckinbill ) enters the hospital for a routine operation and rapidly develops severe complications . Hunting around in the desk drawer for the medical insurance , the wife discovers a little black book in which Hubby has recorded his numerous infidelities . <P> She confronts his paramours , who happen to be some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wanton enough with Hubby 's friends to match his score . He meanwhile is being ministered to by a battalion of quacks and incompetents , and is fading faster with every hour . <P> The whole notion is so outrageously melodramatic that Preminger was probably right in choosing to play it for comedy . He even got Elaine May to rewrite the script . Miss May , however , shrewdly chose not to have her name appear on the screen credits . The large and generally unsubtle cast includes James Coco , who acts with grotesque abandon , Ken Howard , Jennifer O'Neill and Nina Foch . <P> On second thought , Such Good Friends might have worked better the other way . Preminger is usually funnier - remember Hurry Sundown ? - when he 's trying to be serious . <P> ? J.C .
