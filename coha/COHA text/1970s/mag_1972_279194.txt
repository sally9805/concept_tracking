Though it was early in the morning when Mrs. Rhoda Katchen , of East Orange , N.J. , arrived in New York City 's Chinatown , she was not the first patient to join the queue outside the small herb shop at 11 Mott Street . Six others , one of whom had been there since 4:40 a.m. , were already waiting for Dr. Huan Lam Ng , a China-trained acupuncturist . Soon 35 patients-none of them Chinese-were on line for treatment . <P> Dr. Ng 's acupuncture practice , and others like it , were once confined almost exclusively to Chinatown residents . Since U.S. physicians brought back glowing reports of acupuncture 's use in mainland China last summer , however , such practices have boomed . Now they may be ended entirely , at least in New York . Concerned over acupuncture 's administration by unlicensed practitioners , the New York State Department of Education has already shut down a Manhattan clinic devoted to the ancient art . Last week , it ordered Dr. Ng and a dozen colleagues to close their consulting and treatment rooms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are becoming interested in acupuncture . But so little is known about why it works that many doctors are cautious about its indiscriminate use . The reason for the New York crackdown , however , was statutory rather than scientific . The state agency has ruled that acupuncture is the practice of medicine and may therefore be performed only by properly licensed physicians .

Without fluency in English or , in some cases , recognized medical credentials , such men would have difficulty in passing state licensing examinations . <P> Acupuncture patients are understandably upset by the ruling . Mrs. Katchen says that she had spent $25,000 on orthodox treatment for a painful nerve condition without getting relief . <P> Olga Laaland , a native of Guadeloupe , credits Dr. Ng with relieving facial paralysis and enabling him to close his eyes properly for the first time in five years . A few , citing Dr. Ng 's low fees ( $10 a visit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medicine is behind the state action . <P> " None of this happened until people started leaving their regular doctors and seeking out acupuncturists , " said one man Dr. Ng was treating for knee trouble . <P> The Chinese doctors , whose livelihood is threatened , are equally disturbed . A group led by Dr. James L.K. Gong , who combines acupuncture with the use of such exotic folk medications as dried sea horse and seal penis , met at a Chinese restaurant and agreed to ask the state to grant its members temporary licenses or to explore other ways of enabling them to continue to practice .
