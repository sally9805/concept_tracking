" Lardy if the sleep of a laboring man ai n't truly honeysuckle and sweetmeats . Honeysuckle , sweetmeats , and hog dew . " " What ? " Elliott handed him the paper sack . " You never heard that ? I thought everybody knew that old saying . " He sat in the shade of his guitar case and took out the ham and biscuits . " I do n't reckon it 's actually pure-dee exploitation , " he said , grinning . " when the bourgeois capitalist boss feeds a man , on top of paying him wages . Or does this come out of my fifty cents a hour ? " " You better drink that tea . " Elliott said , " before the ice melts . " Grady gestured at Elliott 's canteen . " What 's that you 've got on your hip there ?

Well , Grady , it 's your own damn fault . " he muttered to himself . " What ? " Elliott said . " I swore to myself , " he said grandly , " a fair and baleful oath that I 'd never set foot again on these godforsaken bone-dry local prohibition plains ... it 's all a mad and devious plot between the preachers and the bootleggers . Why , there 's so many bootleggers in Lubbock , Texas , they have to wear badges to keep from hustling each other , and between them and the Baptists a poor honest man can go choke in his own spit Got to prime your peter to piss , the old Jedge used to say , and the old Jedge knew , did n't you , Jedge .

" There 's some well water in a crock down yonder by that big thistle , " Elliott said . " Or you 're welcome to some of mine . " " Never touch it myself , " Grady said . " I 've seen what the stuff does to the inside of pipes . Hear some people even take a bath in it . But let me tell you , son , I have been told that thick wine on the other hand is like unto the virtuous worthies , you know that ? Yet why should you and me strive to he gods and immortals ? Yea , three bottles and you can verily understand the Great Tao . A gallon , bygod , and you 'll get yourself in accord with all nature . " " What 's the Great Toe ? " Elliott said . Grady roared . When he had stopped laughing and could talk again , he said , " Them who know do n't tell . And them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He filed their hoes and they set off , heavy and lagging now in the late still heat of afternoon . From time to time they could hear the low distant whine of a tractor , too far away to be seen , its clatter sounding and echoing across the empty plain . Whirlwinds rustled here and there in the fields , rising against shimmering heat waves . The sky was dark in the north and west , and puffs of dirty white appeared along the edges of blackness . After an hour Elliott saw the sand rising , a roiling brown hedge on the horizon . " Well , " he said , disgustedly , " it looks like we 're going to get a little dirt in our office . " " Pretty late in the year for dusters , id n't it ? " Grady said . " Looks to me like there 's a bank of thunderheads behind it , " " Anybody that tries to forecast the weather in West Texas is either a fool or a newcomer . " Elliott leaned on his hoe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that old saying , too , have you ? " Grady said . He laughed . " Reckon which one I am ? " A gust of wind whipped at his hat , and he started moving again . " I ca n't speak for newcomers , but only a fool would stand here in the middle of a cotton patch and scratch his crotch while half of Oklahoma " ral New Mexico comes howling down the Panhandle on top of him ? " Before they could work out to the turnrow the wind had begun to scatter trails of dust down the furrow . At the turnrow the blinding front of sand hit in full force , and even then big raindrops were falling , clearing the air before a hard , fresh breeze , spattering in the dry dust and settling it and making smudges on their dirty faces . Grady limped over to the guitarcase and began trying to open the lock on the chain , and the rain roared down over them . " Go on ! " Grady yelled . " No use in you getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elliott said " I 'm not much for running either . Have n't had a chance to get rained on in a long time , anyway . I might like it . " Grady gathered up the guitarcase and Elliott carried the hoes . They slogged down the turnrow , slipping and cursing happily and spitting water that dripped off their noses . The rain settled into a steady downpour , and the land that had been powdery and faded now turned deep and brilliant under the bruised sky . A t the house they huddled beneath an extended eave over the back porch . Elliott scraped his mud-caked boots on a horseshoe set in cement beside the dour , and Grady took out a small metalrectangle that looked to Elliott like a miniature hoe blade and used it to clean the mud from his hightop black shoes . " You-all get in this house , " Elliott 's mother said from the kitchen . " You 're going to catch your death. - Grady kept his distance , occupying himself with a careful , elaborate cleaning of his shoes that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door and stood inside . His mother said , " Just like a bunch of brooder chicks . Not got the sense to come in out of the rain . " Grady grinned at her . wiping his shoes carefully on a cloth sack she had spread on the porch . " There 's no quicker way to purgatory than tracking up a lady 's floors , " he said , picking up the guitarcase . " My old daddy used to say , a man that soils the work of woman is a serpent in the temple . " " Well , it 'll dry , " she said . " I 'd lots rather clean up mud than sand  --  Lord knows I 've shoveled enough grit out of this old house . You-all get in yonder in the other room and find some dry clothes . " " Just a heavy dew , ma'am , " Grady said . " I do n't want to put you out . " " No bother . I do n't know what we 've got that 'll fit you ? . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stranger , but now she saw that it would not do . " What I mean is , both my men is big fellas ... " Grady nodded to her . easy . " Yes ma'am . " " ... but anything dry is better than them squashy things . You go on in yonder and he 'll find you something . " Elliott rummaged around in a box in the closet and found a pair of nearly new overalls that had been bought for his grandfather just before his last illness . They were almost Grady 's size . and by taking up the straps as far as they would go and rolling a cuff on the legs , he made them fit comfortably . Elliott gave him dry socks and one of his father 's gray work shirts . " Lordy , lordy . You would n't know me from a pure-dee old scissorbill , " Grady said wryly , with satisfaction . Elliott changed into fresh Levi 's and one of his old Army shirts , and they went into the kitchen . His mother poured them steaming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sipping . Then she remembered the peach cobbler and dipped out a bowlful for each of them . The rain beat down . They could hear it sloshing off the roof and through the gutters into the charcoal filter box and then dropping a long , hollow way into the cistern . " All a man would need to get into heaven , " Grady said , " would be to hold out a taste of this cobbler to old St. Peter , and then offer him the rest to let you in . " " Why , thank you , " she said , fussing over the table . " I do n't get many compliments around here , I 'll tell you that . The men on this place do n't care a thing , just set theirselves down and go at it . Long as it 's hot and they do n't have to fix it . " She was at the sink , and she stared out the window at the rain . " Law , " she said to Elliott , " I guess your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about give up on this crop . " " He 'd better get on home , or he wo n't be able to , " Elliott said . " Water 's already up across the road down there by the pasture . " " Oh , I imagine he 'll just stay all night with Ode and Bess . You know how him and Ode are when they get together . Probably slopping around out in the field by now , like two kids , to see how much it 's rained . " She turned back to the table . " They 've sure suffered with the drouth this year , " she said tiredly . " This 'll help , if it keeps up , " Elliott said " But some of the crop 's pretty far gone . That young cotton over by the ranch sure was suffering these last few days . up in the heat of the day . " " One thing , " she said . " You 'll have plenty of weeds to cut . This 'll make ' em grow wild . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Grady recited . " If I have my way about it . " Elliott said , " we 'll get a bunch of Mexicans in there and get it over with , and quit messing around . " " Well , " Grady said lightly , " I was looking for a job when I found this one . Yea , I am like unto a weed its ownself , flung from the rock , to sail the ocean 's foam where'er the surge may sweep .... " " Nobody ai n't going nowhere till the roads clear up , " Elliott 's mother said . " We might as well get around and fix you a place to sleep before it gets dark . We 've got that old bedstead down in the cellar , I reckon that 's as good a place as any . " She put on her bonnet and a ragged sweater and a pair of Elliott 's old field boots , and they sloshed out to the cellar , carrying a broom and a can of kerosene for the lamp . The rain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and floor were cemented . but the smell there was like old wet dirt , heavy and soured . To Elliott the cellar had always been a safe place . In his childhood it was where they went when the sand blew . He could hear his grandfather saying , Looks like a cloud back in yonder to the north . Ca n't never tell what 's back of that sand . Other times , he was forbidden to play there , but he often hid in the dark cellar and pretended it was his secret lair , crouched for hours beside an old chest of drawers in the thin icy light that sifted down from the cracks in the sloping door . Elliott 's mother lit the lamp and it made blurry shadows behind the massive quilt box and the stacks of trunks and in the rows of canned vegetables and fruits in Mason jars and jelly glasses on high shelves across one wall . " Here , " she said . " one of you take this broom and sweep up some of this dust off the floor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took the broom before Elliott managed to stir . " I swear , " she went on , " looks like that sand 's practically ground into the cement . But I guess we can make it fit to live in for a time . You , Elliott . Get me some fresh bedding out of that quilt box . I usually always get the cellar cleaned so 's we 'll have it ready case a cloud comes up , but we did n't have nothing this past spring but dusters , and I 've just been feeling so bad lately , my arthritis and all , I just never got around to it . " VIliott fumbled around in the quilt box and took 1:4out sheets and a pillow and quilt and handed them to her . In addition to bedding , the quilt box held books that belonged to his mother , many small boxes of various shapes tied with ribbons and strips of cloth , pictures no one could identify , discarded dishes , endless bundles of paper , a jumbled , fragmentary history of the family . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of his childish drawings that his mother had put away carefully in binders . He found a picture of a girl he 'd once loved , and an old scrapbook with most of the pages blank or torn out , and he found the ribbons and decorations he 'd brought home from the war and thought he 'd thrown away , the campaign ribbons for North Africa and the Peninsular Campaign . the unit citation for Cassino. the Purple Heart and the Bronze Star and the Combat Infantryman 's Badge . He remembered how the Purple Heart had impressed them most of all , and he laughed sadly to himself , because it had n't even been his blood or his wound . Beside the quilt box there was a fruit basket full of old phonograph records , and he lifted them out hurriedly one at a time , looking for the one his grandfather had liked . Many of them were by Jimmie Rodgers or the Carter Family , blue yodels and country hymns , and some of the titles he remembered only vaguely : " Tuck Away My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Away Out on the Mountain " and " Little Darling Pal of Mine " and " That Heavenly City . " Then he saw the one he was looking for ; he recognized the yellow label with the bird on it . " Man of Constant Sorrow " was the title , and he began to remember now just how it went ... " I 'm a man of constant sorrow , I 've seen trouble all my days since I said goodbye to Colorado , where . I was born and partly raised , " and there was another verse that began , " Your mother says I 'm a stranger ... " But the record was broken , and he put it gently back into the fruit basket and put the others on top . He closed the quilt box and went over and sat down on the cellar steps in the corner near Grady 's guitarcase . Grady finished sweeping and perched atop a trunk at the foot of the bed . The top of the trunk was higher than his waist , but he got on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his hands on the edge , behind him , and levering himself up . " There , " Elliott 's mother said , puffing up the pillow and swatting the quilt to see if there was dust in it . " Them old bedsprings is kind of rusty , but that ought to make you a pretty good bed . " " It 's fine , " Grady said . " And thank you , ma'am . " " Well , we 'll get out and leave you be , " she said . picking up the broom and kerosene can . " I 'll just put this lantern up here on this shelf . But that 's one of my good lamps , you be careful and do n't turn it up too high and smoke my chimney . " Elliott moved over on the steps to let her pass . " Honey , " she said , " you better go on and milk pretty soon . I do n't imagine your daddy 'll be home . " Elliott said nothing , and she stood at the top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went away . Grady eased himself over onto the bed and stretched out . " AII I need now is about three fingers of good Scotch whiskey . Or even had Scotch whiskey . " Elliott was chipping at the cement step with the broken blade of his pocketknife . He looked up . " Yeah , " he said . " You 're only about two hundred miles from the nearest liquor store . One hundred and ninety-four miles and four-tenths , my grandad used to say , from Elysium to the front door of Pinkie 's Package Store in Big Springs . That 's the closest one . " " Your grandaddy sounds like a man to know . " " He was , " Elliott said . " Oh , for a beaker of ... the true , the blushful Hippocrene , " Grady said , " that I might drink my joyful fill and leave unseen these , these goddammed desiccated calcinated dry fevered fucking abominable plains . What in hell 's name is it about these flat-land farmers that makes ' em vote dry , can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying : ' Vote it dry and drink it neat . ' " " Full of them one-liners. ai n't you ? Well , it 's a bunch of iron-jacketed hardshell hypocritical sonsabitches . Bigtime fascists . Oh she cried and waved her wooden leg : hang them Baptists while a tater vine 'll do the trick . " " Has its advantages , " Elliott said . " No age limit , for one thing . Kid can buy a beer soon as he 's big enough to carry fifty cents and find a bootlegger . " " That 's right . You know any bootleggers ? " " Heck , in town all you got to do is go down to the flats and ask around . - They 'll run over each other gettin to you . " " Free enterprise system , " Grady said . " But that 's in town , There 's twenty miles of muddy road between us and them . What about your friends and neighbors ? " " No moonshining around here that I know of . Used to be an old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know if he 's still around . " " You sure you have n't got a little soothin syrup of some kind stashed away on the premises ? " Elliott grinned and went back to chipping at the step . " Hell 's bells , " Grady said . " Hand me that guitar-case over there . You do take a drink , do n't you . A drank , as my old daddy used to say . " " Heck , " Elliott said , a little uneasily , standing and reaching for the guitarcase . " In the Army tried a little of everything , front Lay rum to rubbing alcohol . " " Well , what I 'm offering is sure not Seagram 's or Johnny Walker Black Label . " " Hey , " Elliott said , lugging the guitarcase . " What 's in here ? Feels like about a ton of pig iron . " Half dragging it , he backed across to the bed and Grady helped him lift it up . " This here is Colonel Grady 0 . Maker 's Jot ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catches , " Traveling medicine show . haberdashery. saloon , and lending liberry . " " Son of a gun , " Elliott said , peering over to look . " There 's everything but a guitar . " " Matter of fact , my clear and melodious lute lies gathering dust beneath the bower of a sweet young thing , a bright flower of Walsenburg , Colorado , who in the summer of nineteen-and-forty-three ? . Well , the gory details I leave entirely to your imagination , trusting that like all country boys you have a filthy and diseased mind . " From beneath a wad of soiled clothes in the guitarcase he withdrew the bottle of vanilla extract . T heguitarcase held several nondescript boxes and objects that Elliott could not identify in the dim lamplight . Most of what he could see was hooks , and he reached out gingerly to turn them and look at the titles .

" Makeup rules , " Grady said . " I thought it might be some new kind of guitar pick . What 's a makeup rule ? " " Printer 's gadget .

You ought to read Huckleberry Finn sometime . It 's a lot better than Torn Sawyer . Tom Sawyer is a prissy little shit . " " There 's a lot of things I ought to read . Maybe I 'll have a chance to catch up on these , if it 's okay with you . " " Three-day loan , and two-bits for ever day a book is overdue . " Then he grinned . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Where 'd you ever get all these hooks , anyway ? " " Oh . one place and another , " Grady said . " I pick them up here and there , read ' em , throw ' em away or give ' em to somebody or just lose ' em . Read all the time , like a madman , do n't understand half of what I read and do n't like the other half . Maybe it 's a habit I got from my old daddy . " " He read a lot , did he ? " " My daddy ? No , not much . " He chuckled . " I do n't suppose he could read his own name the day he died . " You know , " Elliott said , " sometimes I feel like if I could just read enough books and find out enough things I could get everything straightened out . There 's just so much I do n't know , have n't even heard about . " Grady chuckled and took a swig of vanilla . " Pabst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said , " when it comes to figuring out the ways of the Almighty . Here , you just need to sip a little of this soothing syrup . " Elliott took the bottle and held it absently on his knee , staring off into space . " But I do n't ever do anything . ' he said . " I just mess around , and time goes on , and I do n't even know where to start . " Grady said , " Place to start is wherever we can lay hand on more goodly beverage . Do n't your daddy ever take a nip ? Maybe he 's got a bottle hid someplace . " Elliott shook his head . The idea of his father being a secret drinker amused him . " Creme Soda or Kool-Aid is about as wild as he ever gets , " he said . " Jesus Christ and General Jackson , " Grady said , " I 've fallen into the hands of the Dubya-Cee-TeeYew .

" " Well , take a snort of that and hand it back . It ai n't much , but it looks like that 's all we got . " Elliott gulped a mouthful of the vanilla . It was sweet and oily going down , and it lay heavy in his stomach . But he could feel the rubbery warmth spreading out , easing the cramp in his bowels and the tightness across his chest . " If your dad could n't read , how 'd that get you started ? " Grady waved him away . " Oh my god , it 's a long story . Action and reaction of time in opposition . Simultaneity and succession of appearances . Those , as the only relations in time ... " Elliott frowned . " Here , " Grady said , thumbing through the book he had been reading . " How about this ? ' If appearance really appears , it is not nothing and is therefore part of reality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really appear , but it appears to appear . This will not help , for we shall ask again , Does it really appear to appear or only apparently appear to appear ... ' " Elliott took another swig of vanilla and continued to stare at him . " Well ? " " That 's interesting . " " LOGOS ! " Grady yelled , snapping the book shut with a sharp whack . " In the beginning , there was The Word . " He squinted at Elliott . " You know what all that I just read means ? " " Well ... I 'd have to look at it .... " " 0-yes , certainly , " Grady said , dropping the hook back into his guitarcase . He rolled a cigarette through the machine . Used to sing me a song , had a line in it ... Paddy , let your mind roll on . ' Yessir , she cried and waved her wooden leg : Daddy , let your mind roll on . What about that bootlegger you used to know at Elysium ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steps and raised the cellar door , holding it up with his shoulder , and lie could see her on the back porch , with a tin pail in one hand and her egg bucket in the other . " Honey , you better go on now and milk , " she said sternly . " It 's going to be dark before long , and I 've got to go gather up the eggs . " " Hey , Mama , " he said . " I think me and the hand are gon na go over to ' Lysium . To the store . He 's gon na need some gloves and stuff ? " " Why , honey , you 've got to milk , " she said . " Besides , that 's four miles through the mud . You  --  all do n't want to go slogging through all that , and besides , I 'm going to fix some supper after awhile . " " We 'll take the tractor , " he said . " We can eat when we get hack . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she saw that he was determined , " Anyway , go on and milk first . " He stood there a minute , looking at her , then pushed the door wide open . slamming it over and down on its cradle . He stalked out toward her and took the pail and went back to the cellar door . " Come on , " he called down to Grady . " And bring that stuff with you . Put it in your shirt . " They went around the smokehouse to the side away from the house and urinated , and then Elliott jogged on ahead of Grady toward the cow lot , picking his way carefully around , trying to find the places where the scrub grass had grown together in a tight mat over the pasture but still sloshing in the low places and in the web of trails where the cows had churned off the grass and kneaded the ground into gray powder that was now dissolved into ooze and scattered with soggy manure chips and shreds of feed stalks and chaff . Grady followed along . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nosing through the fence and bellowing occasionally . Two of them had calves in the pen . But the cows were mostly interested in the feed trough . One of them , an old tawny Jersey , skittered aside and went flopping off into the pasture when Elliott came up . He drove the other two into the lot with their calves . The calves rushed to suck . " Yea , lo , " Grady called out , " They loosed their sweating steeds from the yoke and tethered them with thongs and brought kine and goodly herds and provided theirsclves with some lip-smacking honey-hearted wine and corn and gathered much wood . " " What 's that ? " " Nothing . I 'm just ranting . Knew an old boy once that could go on all day like that . " " Sounds like one of those preachers on the radio . " Elliott said , watching the calves suck . It was the brindle heifer 's first calf and she did not have a lot of milk . The calf was greedy and kept jabbing its nose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The cow flinched and threatened with her hind leg . " Well , you might say he was a preacher , " Grady said , sipping from the vanilla jar . " He ran a country newspaper . Most guys that run newspapers think they operate under some kind of divine inspiration . " He climbed up the lot fence , one slab at a time , and perched on the top plank , braced against a corner pole . " And maybe they do . " Elliott put a rope around the calf 's neck and dragged it away and tied it to the fence , The brindle heifer stood at the feed trough , munching cottonseed . " I 'll be through in a hurry , " Elliott said , squatting on his heels beside the cow . " Just open her up a little and let the calves have the rest .

" Killing it required several swallows . Then Elliott flipped the bottle over a stack of maize bundles beyond the feedlot . " Nother dead soldier , " he said . " All a soldiers dead . " He stared quietly toward the place where the bottle had landed . Then he laughed , a big happy laugh , for the first time in many days , and he began to hurry again , faster now . untying the calf , roping off the other one , tugging frantically at the second cow 's teats . The cow pivoted around on her forefeet and he followed her in an awkward crouch , cursing absently . One of her teats was cracked , and she kept flicking a rear leg at Elliott whenever he pulled too hard at it . With the pail less than half full , he gave up and turned the calf back to her , then dashed under the shed and began spreading more cottonseed in the feed trough . A fter the rain the clouds had hung low over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black of coming night and along the distant horizon lay a thin icy-white band of sky that spread cold shad. owe from the west . In the lightless gloom under the shed , Elliott worked feverishly , feeling the alcohol numb and fire him at the same time , washedin a dream sense of his own frenzy drawn against the hard silent surface around him , out there , the gray air . fixed points of silver and black , the animals rolling cods. dully munching quietly , Grady rocking gently on the rail fence . " Here , " Elliott said , handing him the milk pail . " Take this on to the house . I 'm gon na see if I can gel the tractor started . Just give it to Mama , or put it on the back porch . She 'll find it . " The tractor was behind the barn , parked beside a cluster of kerosene drums along the pasture fence .

Koolade  --  get some of each She said to tell you , just charge it , " Grady said . " I do n't think anybody 's going anywhere to charge anything , " Elliott said .

You want some beer or not ? " Old Phoebe bowed her head obediently when Elliott went to her with the halter . He swung up on her gently . and when he was settled , she moved forward very slowly . " Climb up on the lot fence , " he said to Grady , " and I 'll ride her over there . She ought to be able to carry double , no bigger than you are .

They rode down through the pasture , past the rffrhard. and across a patch of maize toward the road .
