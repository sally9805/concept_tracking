PYTHON A story by William Braden Here on our very hearths and in our gardens the infernal cat plays with the panting mouse , or holds the hot bird fluttering in her jaws . Crocodiles and rattlesnakes and pythons are at this moment vessels of life as real as we are ; their loathsome existence fills every minute of every day that drags its length along . . . the deadly horror which an agitated melancholiac feels is the literally right reaction to the situation . ? William James R. CHARLES F. BALLARD , JR , had switched off his reading lamp and was almost asleep when the thought entered his mind that there might be a giant python coiled in the darkness under his bed . He opened his eyes . The forty-four-year-old physician had not slept well since ' his divorce , and his dreams had been troubled , but he had no idea what had inspired the ridiculous notion . His bedroom was on the twenty-third floor of a fashionable Gold Coast high-rise . just north of the Loop and only a few blocks from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  where ? Africa ? Asia ? In jungles and tropical rain forests , in any case , and certainly not on the Near North Side of Chicago . Ballard knew that , and he did not really think there was a python under the bed . He knew it was impossible . Compulsive logic forced him to correct himself . " It 's not really impossible , " he thought . - It 's just highly improbable . " He lay on his back , on the vast expanse of the king-size.Posturepedie mattress , in the warm glow of the- electric blanket , and wondered what chain of thought had caused " snake-underthe-bed " to flash inside his skull . The midnight brain was not a very dependable computer , he decided . It was an anarchic pinball machine that lit up in unpredictable combinations once you had snapped the plunger that sent the little ball rolling through the synaptic gates . God , lie hated snakes . He had always hated and feared them with such an intensity that a metaphor involving a snake was probably responsible for the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desperation had driven him to join Alcoholics Anonymous , and even after he had remained sober almost two years , he had not completely accepted the precept that he was powerless over alcohol , and would never again be able to drink normally . He was not totally convinced even by the shock of a psychotic episode after his lapse at a Denver medical convention , when he had ordered one light highball to prove to himself lie was cured and was found four days later hallucinating in a Las Vegas motel room . But then , finally , he had chanced on a passage in a tract written by an anony-mous doctor : " No alcoholic reaches the stage of recovery where his disturbing personality traits are dead . They may be compared with a snake which lies in a dark corner of the mind and which , every now and then , opens one eye to see if the alcoholic is still on guard . " And always after that , whenever he had been tempted to drink , the thought of a baleful yellow eye sliding open had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dry drunk now . That might account for the sudden premonition that had jolted him awake , occurring first as an idea and then as a visual image that registered in his mind 's eye . He lowered his eyelids to see if the image was still there , and at first he saw nothing . Then he observed a shimmering phosphene : a luminosity that seemed just about to come into focus , sinister and threatening , looking vaguely . like a pile of truck tires , and his flesh crawled , and he shook his head . " Rubbish , " he thought . He was not yet afraid . But he was annoyed with himself . HAT WAS IT Heckle used to call snakes when she was a little girl ? Sneaks . She loathed them too . and he had reassured her many times that there were no sneaks in Chicago , nor any of the other phenomena concocted by nature to terrify children . " You know I grew up here myself , " he had told his daughter , and I was always very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a sensible part of the country . I could swim in Lake Michigan , and I knew I 'd never run into a shark or an octopus . There are no bears or tigers here . There are no tarantula spiders . We do n't have earthquakes in Chicago . We do n't have tidal waves . We do n't have floods or hurricanes . And we do n't have a volcano . About the only thing we do have here is an awful lot of crooked politicians . " And yet .. . He rolled over and thought about the python . Why not think about it ? It was n't really there . And surrender to the fantasy was mildly erotic , causing Ballard to shudder with a nervous anticipation he had first experienced when he was a schoolboy climbing the stairs of a brothel to buy his first sex . He just had to be careful now not to let his imagination run wild , which he believed he could do if he repressed the phantom image and concentrated instead on reviewing everything he could remember about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sign , cut in stone , that said : REPTILE HOUSE . Of course . He had completely forgotten the small red-brick building with the tiled roof and columned entrance , on the lakefront in Lincoln Park , just west of the Outer Drive . And it was less than a five-minute walk from his apartment . So it was not exactly true what he had told Heckle , and he had never taken her to see that astonish. ing collection of serpents , right there in the heart of Chicago . But in his own childhood he had paid frequent visits to the Reptile House . It had reminded him of a little Greek temple in a secluded glade , although its walls were darkened by decades of urban pollution , and he had been drawn to it like an Attic pilgrim to the shrine of the Delphic. oracle . He came always for the same reason , to see the big python . And only a few years ago while strolling in the park  --  on a windy autumn day when there were whitecaps on the lake and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loss )  - -  he had responded to an impulse and had stopped to see if the python was still there in the corner tank just inside the main door . There was in fact a python in the tank , an Indian Python molurus . It was very impressive and Ballard had lingered for several minutes to marvel at its large size and satanic appearance . Then he had moved on to the next tank and was stunned . DANGEROUS , said a sign . The warning seemed almost ludicrously unnecessary . The monster on the other side of the glass , who could have been the Indian python 's great-grandfather , was surely the most dangerous-looking creation on the face of the earth . It was a colossus . It was Python reticulatus , a grotesque engine of death , and Ballard was convinced nothing but an elephant could possibly survive an encounter with it . He tried to imagine the power that must reside in those massive coils , which were submerged in a pool of water at the bottom of the tank , pressed against the window . Only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was propped on top of a coil , the eyes closed in apparent slumber , and Ballard stared at it with a burning hatred . " Ugly customer , is n't he ? " Ballard had not noticed the man standing beside him . " I 'm the curator of reptiles , " said the man . Ballard smiled , introduced himself , and observed that the brute inside the tank obviously could crush a man to death with little effort . " Not crush , " the curator had corrected him . " This fellow 's a constrictor , and he actually suffocates his prey . What he 'd do is , he 'd throw a squeeze around you . And every time you inhaled he 'd take another squeeze , until your circulation was cut off and you could n't breathe any more . So there 's no bone-crushing involved in the process of killing at all . " " I see . And then he eats you . " " That 's right , but not until you 're dead . And he does n't chew you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a terrific set of teeth  --  hundreds of them , sharp as needles  --  but they 're curved backward , like hooks , and they 're mainly for catching his prey and holding on to it . He 'll usually grab with the mouth , then coil and constrict . It 's just amazing to see how much this guy can swallow . The jaws unhinge when the mouth is wide open on the prey , ready to eat , and that helps him swallow objects maybe six or eight times his own head size . " The curator obviously enjoyed his subject , but he was a polite man and tried to express an interest by asking the visitor what field he was in . " I 'm an internist , " said Ballard , " but I specialize in diabetes . I always wondered , though ? what do you feed a snake like this ? " " Oh , he 's on a very rigid diet . He 's fed every other week on large rodents and birds , chickens and rabbits and ducks . And they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his prey . I suppose you might say his basic temperament is vicious . " " Would he attack a man ? " " Well , the animal is not meek . Reptiles tend to avoid man , but I 'm not sure what would happen if you went into a jungle and found yourself face to face with a snake like this . I guess if the snake was hungry , there would be a good chance he 'd pounce on you . He 'd probably take a shot . " T HE CURATOR HAD TOLD BALLARD the python was a fairly young specimen and still growing , so it could not be the one he used to visit . " We acquired it when it was a juvenile , just a few feet long , from a private collector who 'd bought it from a dealer . " Remembering that , as he lay in his bed , Ballard was reminded now of still another sign . This one had said : EXOTIC PETS . He had noticed the shop on one of his walks , again not too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and not long after his talk with the curator . Except this time it was night , and snow was falling , and he had stood for a long time on the sidewalk outside the shop , jostled by the holiday crowd and listening to the carols on an outdoor loudspeaker , recalling with a pang the abiding love that he once had known would be waiting for him when he made his way home on just such nights as this , such a long time ago , before he had become lost and alone and a stranger in the world . Then he had entered the brightly lighted shop , a bell jingling as he pushed open the door , and had surveyed the aisles of cages and aquariums , and when the proprietor came forward he had asked if it was possible to buy a reticulated python . " Yes , sir . I could sell you a nice reticulated for about $70 if you were interested in a youngster , say , four or five feet . " " Anything larger than that ? " " Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet or so . And an animal that size would cost you between $175 and $200 . Anything much bigger than that we would n't handle , because of the weight . And I 'm sorry to say we do n't have any reticulateds in stock at the moment  --  we 'd have to place an order for you . " " But you do sell them here . Do many people buy them ? " " Oh , yes . They 're very popular with private collectors . Last year alone we sold about a hundred of them . People keep them in anything from large aquariums to special cages , and a closet in fact makes an excellent cage if you put in lights and a suitable door . " " Oh ? And how many pythons would you say we have here in Chicago ? " " I would say several hundred at least . Because many collectors have more than one . And there 's a great deal of trading that goes on all over the country . " Ballard scowled and clenched his teeth in anger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all over Chicago . Could one be under his bed ? Of course not . He dug his fingers into the pillow , feeling ill at ease , and wished he had not allowed this to go so far . It was time to switch channels , he decided . But , when he attempted to do so , his thoughts wandered instead to various newspaper accounts that had caught his eye over the years  --  and to two in particular that for some reason had lodged in his memory . They were both brief items , reported by wire services , and both from overseas . One told how a mother in a Manila slum had screamed and fainted when she discovered a large python in her baby 's crib , poised to strike , and how half a dozen men had rushed into the room just in time to rescue the infant . The other concerned the owner of a London pet shop who was attacked by a python that wrapped itself around his neck and almost strangled him before companions managed to pull it off . What had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " You can not explain the feeling . You have no pain , but you do not seem to care whether you live or die . " His own feeling would be quite different , thought Ballard . And he made a fresh effort to purge his mind of the subject by reflecting on the office calls that day , which had been a very busy one : four insulin adjustments , a urinary tract infection , two complaints of chest pain , a suspicious liver in an alcoholic patient . He had interviewed a nurse practitioner who was interested in entering joint practice with a physician ? an idea he was seriously considering  --  and he had spent part of the afternoon exploring the possibility of converting his medical records to a problem-oriented system . In fact lie had been reading Weed 's book on the system just before he turned out the light and No ! God ! Please ! The moment of fear passed . It had come and gone in an instant  --  the sudden conviction that there actually was a snake under the bed  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , producing a muscular spasm , and his heart was still pounding from his adrenaline response to the shock . He was hyperventilating , his chest felt constricted , and his right hand tingled as if a hideous mouth had closed upon it and hundreds of bony needles were pricking the skin . Nothing like this had ever happened to hint before . Even those faces of evil he had seen in the Las Vegas motel room had been recognized as hallucinations : depraved faces of men and women and horned beasts , in brilliant Technicolor , that had the plasticity of putty and kept changing in form , like the floating globs in a lava lamp . But this was different , thought Ballard , although the rational explanation was certainly obvious . " If it was a snake , doctor , it would have bitten you . " He smiled at the little joke . M UCH CALMER NOW , he allowed himself to think again about that thing in the Reptile House . Was it lying there now , at this very moment , so close to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad enough , let alone in the same neighborhood of the same city . ) And was it asleep ? On his last visit to the Reptile House , which had seemed so unnaturally silent , the marble chamber suffused with a soft museum light , Ballard had noticed that the creatures in their illuminated tanks bad all been asleep and utterly motionless , as if frozen in time . nestled in dry leaves or coiled around tree limbs , where they hung like obscene ornaments , The curator had said : " Humans and monkeys , after they 're no longer hungry , still have a great need for activity  --  often creative , in our case . But many reptiles have a natural inclination to conserve energy , and most animals are usually controlled by hunger . Pythons in particular . " Ballard had not forgotten that , and it occurred to him now that one reason snakes seemed so alien to him was that they did not play . They were fundamentally nothing more than machines designed to kill-eat-sleep , killeat-sleep . They were simply tubes in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes and caused a primordial landscape to light up in his mind : a panorama that included a forest of ferns and conifers , and a smoking volcano , and iu the distance a boiling sea where pterodactyls in search of prey skimmed over the breaking waves . He ( - rated his image of the Mesozoic Era , which had been the age of reptiles . And now , half a billion years later , the dominant consciousness of that age had been compressed into the little brick building on the shore of Lake Michigan where a placard asked the public : PLEASE Do NOT TAP ON THE CLASS . A VALUABLE REPTILE MAY INJURE ITSELF IF IT STRIKES THE CLASS . MANY CAN NOT BE REPLACED . THANK YOU . Ballard tried to picture the hall of the Reptile House at that hour of the night . It would be dark there now , and the snakes that were hungry would be moving about , because it was in darkness they hunted and in darkness they were fed . Was the python even now making its slow and methodical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its forked tongue fluttered out to taste the air ? ) But then the vision of the Reptile House faded , and Ballard was looking with his mind at a reticulated python that lay on the plush carpeting beneath the bed , its spade-shaped head only a few feet below his own . The black ribbon of its tongue was darting in and out . " A snake will do that whenever he 's trying to pick up a scent , " the curator had said . " It 's like a dog sniffing the air , except it is n't really smelling . The tongue picks up particles from the air or the ground , and then it flicks back in and places the particles in a pair of cavities inside the mouth , in what 's called the Jacob-son 's organ . That has a lining like the inside of the nose in other animals , and the snake can either taste or smell what he puts in there . " What sensation would Ballard produce in a Jacohson 's organ ? The snake in his mind was incredibly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could exceed thirty feet in length , and this one was all of that . Ballard tried to visualize a thirty-foot snake stretched out there in his quarters , with just the head under the bed , and he decided it would easily fill the whole apartment . The hairs on the back of his neck rose at the idea of a gigantic muscle sprawled through all those rooms , winding under tables and chairs , in and out of moonbeams on the carpet . ( It was just as repulsive to think of the same snake observed in those same eerie moonbeams but for some reason reduced now to a skeleton  --  a tunnel of bone , a fantastic birdcage . ) Worse yet was the next idea . If a thirty-foot python could balance on its tail , thought Ballard , it would stand as tall as a three-story building . " Have to stop this , " he thought . " Not funny anymore . " E TRIED A TRICK he had used to distract himself on other sleepless nights when he was hagridden by worries and morbid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the object was to see how long you could prevent yourself from thinking about a white bear . When he had attempted it before , his dark thoughts were usually intruded upon by a parade of friendly bears . But this time the trick did not work ( not even an imaginary bear would venture near the creature in his mind ) and Ballard resorted at last to a desperate tactic . He allowed himself to think about Jessica . He thought of the many times he had called her in those months when the divorce was still pending , and the hard-boiled sound of her voice on the telephone . " Get off the tit , Charlie .... No .... It 's too late for all that , and there 's no point discussing it .... You do n't seem to realize we 're not young anymore .... People change .... You ca n't expect me to feel the same way I did twenty years ago . " When he had pleaded that it made no EellSe now that he was sober , she had told him : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You were a bore at parties . You could never have fun . You could never make small talk . You had to be serious and stuffy and miserable . And you enjoy being miserable . You love every minute of it . " But that was not true . He wanted to be happy . He wanted a happiness he remembered ? a happiness so complete he could never be satisfied with anything less  --  and during one of these calls , trying to explain it to Jessica , he had even been foolish enough to quote Tolstoy : " One can only live when one is intoxicated with life . " She had not cared much for that , of course , and she would not relent , and she had left him to live the rest of his life all alone : to face his dying and death all alone ( as he was all alone now  --  one soul , knowing only itself  --  among the hundred billion suns of the Milky Way Galaxy ) . At the thought of her rejectionhe felt a wave of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All right , have it your way  --  you heard a seal hark . " He recollected the James Thurber cartoon of a seal that had popped into view above the headboard of a bed in which a man and a worn-an were lying . Neither bed partner was in a position to observe the seal poised over their heads , and it was not clear from their expressions if it was the man or the woman who thought a seal had actually barked . Ballard had always felt that little touch of ambiguity added to the humor of the cartoon , and he reflected now that the humor was also enhanced by the fact that the situation was outlandish but not impossible . It was possible to imagine ludicrous and farfetched circumstances that might result in the appearance of a seal in one 's bedroom , and it was no doubt Thurber 's intention to inspire such speculation . It also was possible to imagine circumstances that might result in the appearance of a python in one 's bedroom . What it came down to , in both cases , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had already been established that there were pythons in Chicago , and in fact , from the testimony of the pet-shop owner , there were probably more pythons concentrated inside the city limits than would normally be found in a comparable area of jungle . Contrary to expectation , therefore , Chicago could well be the most likely place in the world to corny across a python . Chicago 's pythons , of course , were supposedly all in captivity . But there was always the possibility of escape , and Ballard knew there were pythons only blocks away in the Reptile House . These did not primarily concern him at the moment , however , because he reasoned that the Reptile House after all was designed for maximum security and staffed by professional keepers , and a snake that did somehow escape would have to cross heavily trafficked streets to reach his location ; it was almost certain to be detected en route ( or run over and killed ) , and particularly so if it were a large specimen . What did concern Ballard was the possibility there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was an enormous building . with hundreds of units , and he did not have even a nodding acquaintance with the other tenants . But he had seen them in the elevators , and some of them had looked eccentric enough to be snake fanciers . So just suppose there was a collector in the building on Ballard 's own floor , perhaps , if not in the apartment directly across the hall  --  and suppose he owned a python that had escaped that very morning when the maid was cleaning Ballard 's apartment . Suppose the maid had left the apartment door open while she worked ; that the python had chosen that moment to slither through the front door and across the short passageway into the bedroom , oozing silently past behind her turned back , and had coiled up under the bed ; that it had concealed itself there by the time the maid completed her chores and departed , closing the door behind her . Ballard looked down , at the floor , and saw a glow that resembled a bright yellow eye . I T was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the darkness . But as he stared at it he imagined the spectral head and body emerging from under the bed and slowly rising from the floor , swaying like a wand , the jaws flashing open to expose the dripping fangs . He felt prickling pains in his hand again as he thought of those fangs sinking into it , and his breathing became labored as he thought of coils tightening Iike steel bands around his chest . " Sleep , my child , and peace attend thee . . . " He remembered the sound of the woman 's voice , in other dark rooms . and the scent of her perfume and powder as she bent over him , and the touch of her hand stroking his hair " ... all through the night . " And it was a comfort to think of the size of the Chicago metropolitan area , as he had seen it at night from airliners landing at O'Hare Airport . It was a comfort to think of all those lights glittering o- down there on that vast gridiron of streets and boulevards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and motor courts , and millions of people sleeping in millions of rooms . Even if there were hundreds of collectors in such a city , what realistic chance was there that one of them actually ( 1 ) lived in Ballard 's building and ( 2 ) owned a python that ( 3 ) had not only escaped but ( 4 ) had also for some reason sought refuge tonight under the bed in Ballard 's apartment ? And yet the people who owned pythons had to live somewhere . So he was not losing his mind , Ballard reassured himself . And , come to think of it , the odds against there being a collector in Ballard 's building were probably comparable to the odds against winning $1 million in the Illinois state lottery . Everybody knew there was almost no hope of winning the million dollars . But somebody always won it . There was such a thing as luck And just as there were always a few individuals singled out by fortune to enjoy extraordinarily good luck , there also were individuals singled out for extraordinarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there were people who were destined to die bizarre deaths : mangled in machinery , crushed in elevator shafts , buried in quicksand , tortured by sadists , devoured by wild beasts . You could pass them on the street the day before they died , and they would look like ordinary people , and you could not pick them out from the crowd ( although their lives in retrospect might seem to acquire some mystical significance ) . If their luck was very bail , the odds did not matter for them . And what about that mother in Manila ? Just before she had entered the room where her child lay , what if she had expressed concern that there might be a python in the infant 's crib ? Her family and friends would have laughed and told her she was talking nonsense . But wait ... If the woman had voiced such fears , would the snake have been there when she did look into the crib ? Or in other words , what were the chances of finding a real snake in precisely the place you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chances that fact would ever coincide with fantasy in such a situation ? There were the odds against his thinking of a snake , and there were the odds against there being a snake . So what were the combined odds that he would imagine a snake under his bed on the same night there really was a snake under his bed ? It would seem they must transcend luck  --  must virtually cancel out pure chance or caprice  --  and reduce the improbable to the impossible . Indeed , his best protection against there being a python under the bed was the fact he was worried there might be a python under the bed . And the logic of the argument seemed so convincing he relaxed with a sigh of relief . But only for a moment . Then the maddening thought occurred . What if the premonition was not really baseless ? What if it was an intuition caused by subtle sensory impressions he had been receiving ever since he had entered the bedroom : by faint whispers of sound , or an unusual odor , or by other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the room ? Or ( consider the possibility ) what if he had actually seen a python , if only for an instant ? When he was removing his tie at the dresser mirror , for example , what if he had observed the reflection of the bed in the glass  --  and had caught just a fleeting glimpse of the meshwork design on one of those maminoth coils ? It would have appeared so utterly anomalous , so removed from the context of ordinary reality , and so unspeakably dreadful . that his conscious mind might well have rejected the image . But that image would have been imprinted in his brain and retained in the subconscious after he climbed into bed , until it gradually rose to the level of awareness . " Oh my God ! " Trembling with fear , he leaned down to look under the bed . And his last sane thought before he died was to wonder how he could ever have doubted what he would find there . ?              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
