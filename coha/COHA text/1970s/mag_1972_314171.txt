Edmund Muskie was haggard and weary as the New Hampshire primary ended . He concluded his victory speech with what sounded like the grumblings of a man wary of being mugged from behind . " The one sensation that I feel most of all almost every day , " he said , " is a twitching between my shoulder blades . " That twitching will become more pronounced if he suffers another primary setback this week in Florida , where a very poor showing could deal him a serious blow . <P> As the favorite son-in-law candidate from next door Maine , Muskie had to win big in New Hampshire . His disappointing 48% of the vote raised doubts as to whether he could sew up the Democratic nomination before the convention . One reason why Muskie slumped in New Hampshire was his effort to campaign simultaneously in several other states with upcoming primaries , particularly Florida . An easily fatigued campaigner who complains about his " mad schedule , " he spent only 13 days stumping in New Hampshire this year as compared with Senator George McGovern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on the other hand , steadily built up his share of the vote from 18% a month and a half ago to an impressive 37% in the end . <P> Los Angeles Mayor Sam Yorty , Indiana Senator Vance Hartke and House Ways and Means Chairman Wilbur Mills , a late-starting write-in entry , drew a total of 13% of the vote and little encouragement . On the Republican side , Congressmen Paul McCloskey ( 20% ) and John Ashbrook ( 10% ) , attacking the President from the left and right respectively , failed to mount any serious threat . Looking on from afar , Richard Nixon weighed in with a comfortable 69% . Only three days after the primary , McCloskey dropped out of the race . <P> Muskie 's cause was not helped in the final days of the campaign by his weepy response to the attacks of William Loeb 's Manchester Union Leader . When it became apparent that his margin was fraying , Muskie belatedly returned to the state for five last days of blitz campaigning . In a campaign devoid of any single burning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national " candidate and unabashedly sought support on the basis of " regionalism . " Alluding to the New England " sense of community , " he told a gathering in the paper-mill town of Berlin : " If I ca n't get help from my friends close to home , I do n't know where to expect it . " <P> Despite Loeb 's attacks , Muskie did expect help from Manchester , the state 's largest city and a Democratic stronghold that accounted for 20% of the party 's total vote last week . Muskie barely held his own , managing to eke past McGovern only by the scant margin of 511 votes . Nobody had to tell Muskie that breaking even in city wards is not the way a Democrat wins nominations , much less the presidency . <P> Two Ends . Claiming support that was " both broad and deep , " McGovern not only fared well in the working-class wards but swept 80% and 72% of the vote respectively in the college towns of Hanover ( Dartmouth ) and Durham ( University of New Hampshire ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And , while topping McCarthy 's 1968 showing by more than 7,000 votes , he also managed to make off with at least five of the 20 convention delegates that Muskie figured he had locked up .
