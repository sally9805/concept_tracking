Despite her name , Tuesday Weld was born on a Friday . Then why is she called Tuesday ? There is no telling for sure , though in the past she has said that the name was 1 ) a childhood corruption ( " Tu-Tu " ) of Susan , her given name , 2 ) derived from the day when all the worst things happened to her mother , and 3 ) a mispronunciation of two-days , the length of time her mother was in labor with her . Whatever the truth , the world is beginning to realize that , at 28 , Tuesday Weld is a first-rate actress . <P> Weld film festivals have been held in Manhattan , and there is already something of a Tuesday Weld cult , which was partially inspired , paradoxically , by the fact that she has been so good in so many bad films . " She was undervalued year after year , " says Roddy McDowall , who starred with her in Lord Love a Duck , one of her less awful movies . As a drum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ film , she mixed innocence with evil to chilling effect , etching her character with acid and honey . <P> Now at long last she may have found a script that fits her talents . In Play It As It Lays , a movie currently being adapted from Joan Didion 's novel , Tuesday portrays Maria , an actress in search of a breakdown in the vast emptiness of Southern California . " She knows the role so well she could phone it in , " says Director Frank Perry ( Diary of a Mad Housewife ) . " I tested hundreds of girls for the part , but I always knew it had to be Tuesday . " <P> Like Maria , Tuesday has always had the reputation of being a difficult performer to work with . Like Maria , she has had a troubled private life that has made her something of an untouchable flower in lotus land . " Miss Weld is not a very good representative for the motion-picture industry , " complained Gossip Columnist Louella Parsons , Hollywood 's dragon lady , when Tuesday was 16 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type minipics . Actually , Tuesday 's sins-odd clothing , bare feet and open love affairs - would have seemed quite normal a decade later . Her chief offense was to be hip too soon . <P> Tuesday has been too soon in almost everything she has done . Born in New York 's Greenwich Village , she was supporting her family-her mother and an older brother and sister-as a child model when she was four . Her father had died when she was three . When she was twelve , she appeared in her first movie , Rock , Rock , Rock , a cheapie made in Brooklyn to cash in on the rock-'n ' - roll craze of the ' 50s . Whatever its demerits , the film projected Tuesday as the archetypal nymphet , Shirley Temple with a leer . " The girl I generally played was a little whorish teen-ager who would sleep with anybody , and yet has a childlike quality , " says Tuesday .
