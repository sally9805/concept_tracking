After six months of explosive rumors , the Watergate bugging trial got under way at last . But hardly had the jury been chosen last week in a Washington courtroom when one of the seven defendants pleaded guilty to the charges against him . By week 's end , as Judge John Sirica moved the trial temporarily to a closed courtroom and barred spectators , there were reports that four of the other defendants planned to do the same . Pleading guilty would not , of course , make the defendants invulnerable to severe punishment ; the maximum sentence for their offenses ranges between 24 and 34 years in prison with fines of between $70,000 and $80,000 . But the guilty pleas could increase the chance that the real truth in the Watergate case-whether or not top officials in the Nixon Administration sanctioned the break-in at the Democratic Party 's Washington headquarters last June-would remain obscured . <P> The first defendant to plead guilty was E. Howard Hunt , 54 , a former White House consultant and longtime CIA official who played a prominent part in the planning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Cuba in 1961 . At first Hunt offered to plead guilty to only three of the six charges against him , but under pressure from Judge Sirica he agreed to include all six . <P> " Anything I may have done I believed to be in the best interests of my country , " Hunt declared . Had there been a conspiracy involving high Government officials ? " To my personal knowledge , " he replied , " there was none . " Hunt insisted that the key factor in his decision to plead guilty-and thus escape the ordeal of a long trial-had been the death of his wife in a Chicago plane crash last month . Still , his action inevitably increased speculation that he was seeking to avoid further disclosures in the case . <P> Cash . Late in the week , reports circulated in Washington that four of the remaining defendants-three of whom are Cubans from Miami-were being offered large cash settlements by undisclosed " friends " if they would plead guilty and thus avoid a potentially embarrassing trial . The offers , TIME learned , ranged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he spends in prison , with additional amounts to be paid at his release . <P> Hunt , who said last week that he had recruited the four into the spying operation , told TIME Correspondent David Beckwith : " I 'm almost certain that the Cuban community in Miami will take care of those four . The great majority of the Cuban community is convinced that what they were doing at the Watergate will redound to the ultimate benefit of Cuba , and I 'm convinced of that . " Presumably he meant that most anti-Castro Cuban refugees favored a Nixon victory in November . <P> One of the two remaining defendants is G. Gordon Liddy , onetime White House aide and counsel to last year 's Committee for the Re-Election of the President . Liddy , a lawyer , might be the most reluctant of the defendants to plead guilty , since this would probably lead to his disbarment . <P> Even if the trial should end prematurely this week , however , it has already produced considerable additional detail .
