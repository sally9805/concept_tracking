txt WASHINGTON  --  Chicago will receive $199 million in federal grants for transit projects during the next two years with a promise of $400 million more to build a new downtown subway if officials agree to give up plans to build a major segment of the proposed Crosstown Expressway . Outgoing Transportation Secretary William Coleman announced the grants Wednesday after more than a week of meetings by federal , state , and city officials trying to reach a compromise acceptable to both sides . THE FEDERAL GRANTS INCLUDE : ? $110 million of the $139 million needed to extend the rapid transit line along the Kennedy Expressway from its present terminal at Jefferson Park eight miles to O'Hare International Airport . ? $3.5 million for engineering and environmental work to plan a proposed subway beneath Franklin Street to replace a large part of the elevated structures in ' the Loop . ? $85.5 million for projects including acquisition by the Regional Transportation Authority of the commuter fleet of the Chicago &; North Western Transportation Co. and money to cover cost overruns on acquiring new equipment for the Chicago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announced less than . 24 hours before Coleman leaves office as President Ford 's transportation secretary and after frantic last-minute negotiations instigated by Sen. Percy R. , Ill. to reach a compromise on the Crosstown . THE NEGOTIATIONS left unresolved whether the proposed Franklin subway // City gets transit funds // will ever be built , however . Mayor Bilandic said at a press conference with Coleman that " we 're still committed to the Crosstown . " However , it was learned that Bilandic , as a condition of the grant , signed a letter to Coleman promising to cooperate with Gov . Thompson in exploring the possibility of scrapping a major portion of the Crosstown Expressway and diverting those funds to build the Franklin subway . Federal law permits municipalities to divert interstate highway funds to transit projects . THE COMPROMISE which resulted in Wednesday 's announcements came out of a four-hour meeting last Sunday in the Bismarck Hotel between Percy , Gov . Thompson , Bilandic , Chicago Public Works Commissioner Marshall Subway , and Arthur Wirtz , head of the Chicago Urban Transportation District  --  a taxing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the aging Loop elevated structure . Coleman was ready to announce the O'Hare line grant last week , but held up any statement after Percy intervened seeking more federal money for the city . The Franklin subway proposal has been tied up for years in a dispute between the late Mayor Daley and former Gov . Walker over construction of the Crosstown Expressway . Daley wanted the road built , but Walker sought to have the Crosstown funds diverted for the subway . Coleman 's position was that the federal government did not have the money available to build the line unless the city was willing to give up claims on highway funds earmarked for the Crosstown . TRANSIT OFFICIALS said it the city agrees to transfer interstate highway funds to build the subway it will probably doom at least the northern segment of the Crosstown proposed to run from the Eisenhower Expressway at approximately Cicero Avenue to the KennedyEdens expressways junction . However , tentative fiscal studies indicate that the bulk of the 22-mile expressway would have to be scrapped to come up with the $400 million necessary for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 22d Street under Franklin Street in the downtown area to connect the existing Dan Ryan , Ravenswood , and Evanston Express rapid transit lines now using the Loop elevated .
