txt Letters Letters To boycott or not In his article " Art , politics and torture chambers " ( Aug. 15 ) , Victor S. Navasky has confused rather than clarified the issue of the boycotting by performing artists of the Shiraz festival in Iran . Merce Cunningham 's statement as to his personal decision to withdraw from the festival is not , as Mr. Navasky asserts , " ambivalent . " I have a copy of Mr. Cunningham 's entire statement on the subject . It begins with his definition of the role of the artist as separate from that of the individual who is politically involved . He then proceeds step by step to his conclusion that in Iran , where artist and involved individual alike are subject to arrest and torture by the Shah 's secret police , there could be no other decision but to withdraw from the celebrations in Shiraz . Merce Cunningham came to this clear decision after informing himself on conditions in Iran , but did not announce the withdrawal of his company from the festival until the company in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incidentally , was unanimous . Mr. Navasky has unfortunately juggled the quotes from Mr. Cunningham 's statement so that the implication is that Merce Cunningham was in some doubt about his company 's decision . Mr. Navaskv 's loaded question as to why performing artists refuse to appear in Iran while appearing in Rumania also requires comment . The Shah of Iran is totally and unequivocally our resnonsihility . It is we who placed him on his Peacock Throne . and who are keeping him there . He is as much our creation as was President Thieu in South Vietnam . Artists are not for a moment interfering in the government of another nation when they refuse to take any part in the Shah 's brutal regime , for Iran is. to our everlasting shame , a political adjunct of the U.S.A. KAY BOYLE San Francisco . The author replies : I am indeed sorry that Miss Boyle . for whose own work I have only the greatest admiration . found my article on cultural boycotts confusing . She must be right since the point of the article  --  that such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persons may differ , but that many , myself included , agree that this year a boycott of the Shiraz festival might have useful results ? seems to have passed her by . There was not , of course , space to reprint the Cunning . ham statement in its entirety , but my own reading of it ? confirmed by one who was there when the vote was taken ? suggests that Miss Boyle 's explication glides too quickly over his assertion that " I have always felt that my work should be free to be shown in any place that 's made open to it . " It was Bill Crowfoot , the folksinger , who asked himself the question " Why should I be willing to play in Rumania , where life is probably much worse than in Spain , and not be willing to go to Spain ? " Nevertheless , I think the question is a real and not a loaded one . That a particular tyrant may or may not be our creation seems to me relevant , but it does not dispose of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not our creations ; that does not mean they should not be resisted . If the Shah 's brutality is our responsibility , the question is not whether to resist it but : How ? A matter of quotation I am compelled to respond to the incorrect quotations attributed to me by Victor S. Navasky . At their request , I met with three writers last May and our discussion covered human rights , American military aid to Korea and our fast-growing economy . I explained that our success in attracting a large amount of foreign capital essential to our economic development is attributable to an abundance of skilled labor at highly competitive wages and social and political stability . This stability has been maintained despite constant military threat and harrassment from North Korea . As a result , our people are living better today than ever before . I also pointed out to these visitors that in our attempt to maintain the important dual thrust of economic growth and political stability we do not yet have the same degree of freedom enjoyed in the U.S. Moreover , it takes time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I went on to explain that the constant threat and fear of attack from the Commu-Letters nists has forced my Government to institute some temporary political restrictions , all within the framework of the Constitution of the land . As for the illogical reference to my having said that Western venture capital wants , among other things , " political dictatorship , " I fear that my visitors have confused their preconceived notions about Korea with reality . I never said anything to that effect , nor do I believe that Western capitalists prefer doing business with political dictatorships , and I certainly do n't consider that my Government is a political dictatorship . BYUNG KI HAN Ambassador , Republic of Korea , Office of the Permanent Observer to the United Nations . New York City The author replies : Not only did the three writers in question all remember the Ambassador 's saying what he now denies having said , but his statement was so at odds with their preconceptions that one of them , Ted Solotaroff , in astonishment asked the Ambassador whether he really meant to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replying yes . Crime and politics In general , I approve of Walter Goodman 's recommendation of posthumous pardons for Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti ( " Sacco , Vanzetti and me , " Guest Observer , Aug. 22 ) for precisely the reason he advanced  --  namely , the hope that " the refreshed memory of their case will stir a reasonable doubt in the minds of future juries and judges faced with dissenters , blacks , counterculturists and variations thereof . " It would have been far better , of course , given the tenuousness of the evidence against them , if their lives had not been taken , but there is nothing any of us can do about that now , except to point out the irreversible nature of capital punishment . What does concern me deeply is Mr. Goodman 's somewhat snide characterization of the prison correspondence of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg as the seeming products of " a Union Square mimeograph machine , " his equation of a pardon to Richard Nixon with the academic // Letters // one he is proposing for Sacco and Vanzetti @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spawned " a body of theory . . . which holds that anyone convicted of a crime with political overtones can ? not be guilty if he or she shares the political predilections of the beholder , or can be made to serve them . " Anyone who has read the beautiful and moving letters written by the Rosenbergs during their incarceration to their children , relatives and friends could hardly label them rhetorical or doctrinaire broadsides . Moreover , the official documents recently turned over to their sons as a result of their Freedom of Information Act suit clearly reveal the existence of a conspiracy between the trial judge , the prosecution , the F.B.I . and the Department of Justice to deny due process of law to the Rosenbergs as well as to Morton Sobel ! , their co-defendant . Surely , no one could possibly claim that Richard Nixon , about whose guilt of many serious crimes there can be no doubt , much less a reasonable one , was the victim of anything but his own perfidy . As for the " body of theory " attributed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consistently maintained , and believe with all my heart that the criminal-justice system is deliberately constructed and administered to protect the haves from the have-nots and to perpetuate the status quo . But this does not mean that I , or those who may subscribe to this thesis , think that every person convicted of a crime is innocent solely because there may be " political overtones " to the conduct in question or that such people may be callously used to serve anyone 's " political predilections .

Hanging in there It appears to me that Bruce Porter ( " I 'm not coming down ' , " Aug. 15 ) has done an intensive research on all of the negative aspects of hang gliding and shows it to be totally out of control and without any organization , attracting only daredevils who are only interested in coming into a close contact with danger . At the risk of disappointing Mr. Porter , I will point out that the sport of hang gliding is no longer open to any bystander without any instruction , thanks to the many dedicated groups and organizations which have taken on the responsibility of developing safe teaching methods and equipment , developing , managing and regulating flying sites as well Letters as a sound pilot identification and licensing system ( United States Hang Gliding Association , New England Hang Gliding Association , New Jersey Hang Gliding Association , Long Island Hang Gliding Association , to name a few ) .

ROBERT DOORNICK New York State Hang Gliding Association New Rochelle , N.Y . Sugar is sweet Jean Mayer and I have over the years disagreed on a few points of nutrition . His article " The bitter truth about sugar " ( June 20 ) has a number of points I wish to take issue with : ( 1 ) Mayer referred to the sugar content of breakfast cereals and mentions one containing 58 percent sugar and another 70 percent , yet he fails to mention three recent independent studies coming from dental schools at Harvard , Michigan and Alabama , all done with relatively large numbers of children over substantial periods of time showing that dental decay was not influenced by consumption of breakfast cereals with or without sugar , whether sugar was added by the manufacturer or at the table , or even whether cereal was included or omitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anticariogenic effect of milk  --  and 95 percent of breakfast cereals are consumed with milk . ( 2 ) Mayer dwelt a great deal on the degenerative and metabolic diseases  --  arteriosclerotic diseases of the heart and blood vessels , cancer , diabetes , etc . He wrote : " Diet and mode of life are involved in these new pandemics . " With ? this statement I completely agree but with his frequent implication and innuendo that " the sugar content of our diet " is the chief culprit , I emphatically disagree . ( 3 ) Mayer wrote : " Purveyors of health foods and ' natural foods ' enthusiasts are unani-Letters mous in their statements that white sugar is toxic . " But why did n't he follow with a statement that they are unanimously wrong ? ( 4 ) Mayer wrote : " There is a strong suspicion that a large sugar intake may be causally related to diabetes .

The suspicions and innuendoes are very effective in unnecessarily frightening the public about the safety of our food supply , but they sound more ? like a consumer activist than a rational scientist .
