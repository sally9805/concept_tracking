Long sought Southern waterway threatened by lawsuit <P> Ever since the early 19th century , citizens of Alabama and Tennessee have periodically urged the Federal Government to build a waterway linking the Tennessee and Tombigbee rivers . Such a canal would provide a direct outlet to the Gulf of Mexico for all the barge traffic in the Ohio River Basin and southern Appalachia . After years of studies and debates , Congress finally authorized the Tenn-Tom project in 1946 , and after 2 decades more of planning and preparation , construction began in 1972 . Today the project is still only one-quarter complete , leaving a deep gash in the countryside that looks as if it had been capriciously made by the knife of some vengeful god . <P> One of the biggest and costliest ( $1.6 billion ) enterprises ever undertaken by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is now being challenged by a lawsuit . The Environmental Defense Fund and the Louisville and Nashville Railroad , which stands to lose business to the waterway , charge that the corps extended the width of the channel from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corps told a congressional committee in 1951 that it had no intention of widening the waterway and acknowledged that such a change would require congressional approval . Yet the engineers later proceeded to widen the waterway without clearly stated authorization . As the trial got under way last week , Federal Judge William C. Keady noted with a smile : " It appears the corps has changed its mind . " <P> The corps argues that the bigger channel was not a matter of capricious empire building but was made necessary by changing conditions . Its studies indicated that an increase in the amount of traffic as well as in the size of barge tows ( the number lashed together ) would make the smaller waterway obsolete before it was built . The corps also claims that Congress had tacitly approved the change by repeatedly voting annual appropriations for the project . Explicit authorization , says the corps , came from Secretary of the Army Stanley Resor , who wrote a memo in 1967 approving the larger waterway . <P> In rebuttal , the plaintiffs maintain that Resor okayed only the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ channel . They cite letters he sent at the time to members of Congress declaring that the project was " only marginally justified . " Added Resor : " The Tennessee-Tombigbee project continues to lack that margin of economic safety which typically marks federal investments in water resource development . " But Al Fitt , who served as special assistant to Resor for civil functions ( including Corps of Engineers ' projects ) , submitted an affidavit to the court stating that his boss 's memo was intended to approve the actual widening . <P> While challenging the tactics of the corps , the environmentalists oppose the Tenn-Tom on more basic grounds . They believe that the largely unpolluted Tombigbee will be turned into a series of small stagnant pools . Some 45,000 acres , rich with wildlife , fossils and Indian relics , will be inundated . Randall Grace , former executive director of the Tombigbee River Conservation Council , asserts that the project will " transform northeastern Mississippi into a huge garbage dump . The promoters say that it will turn the region into the Ruhr Valley of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
