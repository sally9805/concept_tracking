Seeking the Common Interest The India-Pakistan War India and Pakistan are at war for the fourth time . There is an understandable tendency to identify the causus Belli with the situation in East Pakistan . There is truth in this . The abrogation of elections of East Pakistan 's chosen leaders ; the denial of the peoples ' expressed desire for regional autonomy ; the bloody suppression of this desire ; the enormous flight of millions upon millions of Bengalis - largely Hindus - to India , a country with its own mouths to feed and citizens to house ; the desire of Pakistan to preserve its national unity both for political and economic reasons ; India 's military and diplomatic support for an independent Bangla-Desh ; the failure of the world community , including our own country , to exercise early and effective influence toward a political settlement ; Kashmir , the partition itself ; all are contributing factors . Since leaving my post as United States Ambassador to the United Nations three years ago , I have tried to avoid second-guessing our government in matters such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no longer has access to the diplomatic exchanges which preceded the conflict . Yet , as the official primarily responsible for handling our government'sefforts to settle the 1965 war between India and Pakistan , I can not forebear raising some issues , as a concerned citizen , friendly both to India and Pakistan . Before doing so , I should like to recall briefly what occurred in the fall of 1965 , when war broke out between India and Pakistan over the unresolved question of Kashmir . It would be disingenuous to say that I did not have views about the attitudes underlying the 1965 war , or do not have about this war . Nevertheless , in 1965 , on my advice and that of others , our government scrupulously refrained in the UN and in Washington from publicly or privately passing judgment on who was responsible . We single-mindedly pursued the objective of bringing about a cease fire and restoration of the status quo ante . We did not wait until full-scale war erupted . As President of the Security Council at the time , by accident of rotation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movements and sporadic fighting were reported , without awaiting the full-fledged conflagration which ' occurred later and which has occurred now . It is true that we invoked a Security Council rule permitting the President of the Council to convene a meeting where peace is threatened , but this fooled no one . I was the American Ambassador , and , obviously , the United States was taking the initiative to try to cool the situation before a general eruption . At the Security Council , we made every effort to avoid any vote before we were able by intensive private negotiations , particularly with the Big Powers , to arrive at a consensus of how the United Nations effectively could act in the matter . While there are some differences between today 's events and those in 1965 , there are also similarities . Then , as now , the Soviet Union strongly espoused the cause of India , while China , though not in the UN , both diplomatically and by a limited movement of troops made clear its support of Pakistan . Neither India nor Pakistan , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Council to assume jurisdiction . Indeed , at one point as a result of a particularly bitter attack by Pakistan 's foreign minister against India , the Indian representative walked out on the Council meeting . But we and other like-minded nations persevered and after prolonged and difficult negotiations at the UN succeeded in having the Security Council adopt three successive and unanimous cease-fire resolutions . The first two were not immediately honored but the third , in a strengthened form demanding a cease-fire , was honored and the fighting came to a halt on September 22 , 1965 . In this connection , it should be noted that the war was brought to an end at the United Nations in September and not as a result of mediation by the Soviet Union at Tashkent in January of the following year . It is true that the Soviet Union made a considerable effort after the cease-fire and the termination of hostilities to mediate the Kashmir differences at Tashkent and to restore normal relations between India and Pakistan . In this , Mr. Kosygin and his colleagues were not successful . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to date , has been successful in settling the Kashmir dispute or the other long-standing differences between India and Pakistan . The late Frank Graham , acting as the Secretary General 's special representative , tried to do so and failed ; the United States throughout the years has tried to do so and has failed , and the Soviets found at Tashkent what we have bitterly learned in Vietnam and elsewhere , that the superpowers can not readily impose their will on other countries in this changing world . The history I have recounted , however , should not obscure the basic fact that in 1965 the United Nations in unanimity succeeded in having a cease-fire observed and a disengagement of forces take place between India and Pakistan while currently similar efforts to date have been entirely unavailing . Why the difference today ? The basic difference , obviously , is Bengal and what has occurred there . It is unrealistic to believe that a cease-fire and withdrawal , whether ordered by the UN or urged by the superpowers , can occur absent a political solution . The millions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has existed all the years since partition . The Soviet-Indian friendship treaty , ? . has freed India to take action which it might have hesitated to take without a firm commitment of Soviet support at the UN and in the field . Perhaps the massing of Soviet troops on the Chinese border has eliminated concerns about Chinese military involvement in the dispute . And perhaps all of these have contributed to the result . What is to be now ? The President has said we are neutral , and in the sense that this means we should not intervene with troops or arms , he is right . Yet diplomatically , it can not be gainsaid that we have intervened , and , in my view , unfortunately , by declaring India to be the aggressor and mainly responsible for what occurred . Regardless of the merits , in so doing we have lost , at least for now , our capacity to use our good offices to help settle both the conflict and the political situation in East Pakistan . The UN , in light of what has occurred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effectively again , at least now . While the General Assembly under the Uniting for Peace Resolution by an overwhelming majority has called for a cease-fire and withdrawal , I doubt that this call will be honored , at least for some time to come . Thus the war will go on , the status quo ante changed , soldiers and civilians on both sides killed , land and property destroyed and antagonisms deepened . Moreover , the General Assembly can only recommend and not decide . Some will say that all wars sooner or later grind to an end . But some wars grind to an end later than sooner . And my experience is that the longer a war goes on , often the harder it is to settle . Wars have a momentum of their own and sometimes continue long after it is apparent to all what the ultimate result will be . If there is doubt about this , look at World Wars I and II and look at Vietnam . The only hope I see now , and it may be a faint one , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political issue is the interest of India in not fully undermining the partition , with long-range consequences difficult to foretell , and in not promoting similar secessions in West Bengal and Kashmir , and the interest of Pakistan in preserving itself as a nation . Also and importantly , the United States , the Soviet Union and China have a common interest in containing the conflict and preventing its ending on the basis of a military victory which will leave wounds that will fester for generations . It looks now , if one judges by the UN debates , that there is no recognition by India and Pakistan of the full implications to them of unstabilizing the partition , and that there is no common interest by the superpowers . But UN public debates are often deceptive . They frequently tend to submerge the common interest rather than illuminate it . The common interest of the superpowers is the maintenance of peace on the subcontinent . They can not order a settlement but they can use their good offices to urge a reasonable settlement . I do not expect DECEMBER 18 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Soviet-Chinese antagonism precludes joint action . But each of the great powers in its own way can and should be a moderating influence , if only in its own interests . I have already indicated that the United States and the other big powers have some fence mending to do in light of their respective partisan statements . I venture the hope that through quiet and timely diplomacy by the superpowers in or out of the UN , a way may be found to a settlement of the war based upon two objectives : a political solution of the problem of East Pakistan , including the refugee problem in India , and an end to the war on a basis that both countries can live with . In saying this , I am well aware that day by day this becomes more difficult , for armies are on the march . But surely a fresh effort must be made in the mutual interests of the parties and in the name of our common humanity and world peace and stability .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
