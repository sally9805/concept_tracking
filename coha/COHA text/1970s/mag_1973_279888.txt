The Right To Meat <P> Sir / I suppose the next thing we will hear from the housewife is that every American has a right to meat April 9 . I would like to invite some of those housewives to our farm this fall to help feed the cows . Five percent of the population feeds the rest . What is going to happen if that 5% goes on strike ? <P> EVELYN HARDY <P> Tuscaloosa , Ala . <P> Sir / The U.S. needs to become accustomed to perpetually higher meat prices . With America 's growing urbanization and increasing pressure on the land , there is no way that we can continue to allocate the ten acres of range land necessary for each head of cattle . <P> BYRON LUND <P> Magna , Utah <P> Sir / As an American living abroad , I am aghast when I return home to see the amount of food thrown away each week by average middle-class families in the U.S. And if less were spent on so-called junk foods ( soft drinks , sweets and snacks ) it seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lunch and dinner . Meat prices are too high , but Americans are spoiled and the rest of the world is unsympathetic . <P> JOANNE ABDO <P> Mexico City <P> Sir / You should be aware that if you go to a good restaurant , have a steak dinner and leave an average tip , the tip is larger than the amount the farmer received for producing the meat you just ate . <P> TOM MAGILL <P> Lewis , Iowa <P> The P.O.W.s ' Choice <P> Sir / Instead of courageously choosing prison or exile when asked to fight an unjust war , the tortured P.O.W.s April 9 chose to bomb civilian populations . Yes , they paid for it , but not nearly as harshly as their victims did . Let 's not make heroes where there are none . <P> MAUREEN F. CROCKETT <P> Saint Albans , W. Va . <P> Sir / After reading about the torture of the P.O.W.s , all I can say is : God have mercy on President Nixon if he sends one dime to rebuild North Viet Nam . <P> CHARLES E. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is bitter medicine to look at returning P.O.W.s as accomplices of an illegal and possibly immoral same war ; but I imagine the Germans felt the same confusion in the late 1940s , when their returning P.O.W.s , like ours , came home in personal victory but national defeat . <P> DANIEL LOUIS <P> Cincinnati <P> Have-Nots and the White House <P> Sir / TIME describes the aura of greed in present-day Washington April 2 but fails to explain the cause . The men at the top are essentially havenots , parvenus using the White House to further their personal ambitions . <P> That is why it is preferable to have aristocrats in high office . Men " to the purple born " have wealth and class before they make their first campaign speech and do not need a high office to acquire either . <P> ( MRS . ) URSULA KUGELMAN <P> New York City <P> Sir / The sentencing process is not totally arbitrary as TIME suggests April 9 . It is aided by sentencing institutes , trial judges , colleges , probation and sentencing reports , conferences , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by hard , practical experience in the real world .
