txt Letters to the Travel Editor ERNEST BARRABONNIE FRANK NIERMANMRS . L.C. WILLIAMSROBERT L. TUCKERMARK STARRT ... pg . XX1 3 Letters to the Travel Editor Greenland To the Editor : Regarding the article " Greenland : A Fringe of Color on the Icecap " ( Travel Section July 8 ) , I was one of " the 200 Americans " who visited that country last year and would like to add a sightseeing attraction that author Robert D. Hershey Jr . seems to have missed . Across the fjord from Narsarsuaq ? about an hour 's run by cabin cruiser ? lie the ruins of Bratthalid , home of Eric the Red and of his even more famous son , Leif Ericson . The ruins are authentic , very visible and seem to me to be one of the major historic sites in the western hemisphere , yet they are seldom visited . In fact , there is no dock , and one lands , according to the tide , either by jumping onto a projecting rock , or climbing two at a time , from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crew member . From the shore a five-minute walk brings one to the foundation of the long house , which sheltered Eric , his family , his followers and , by projection on the inland side , his sheep and perhaps a few horses through the Greenland winter . ( A few flat rocks standing on end still divide the stalls ) . Probably stones were used for only the first few feet of the the walls , then in the old Icelandic fashion layers of turf were laid on these to a desired height . On what was still part of Eric 's " steading " lies another historic site : the clearly outlined foundation of the first Christian church in the western hemisphere . This site has been definitely identified by the presence of more than 30 skeletons buried in Christian , fashion close to the church . This was the tiny church that Eric finally allowed his wife , Tjoldhlld , to build on his land . Tjoldhild was a finn convert ? Eric less firm ? through the offices of the priest that Leif brought home after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , some not yet excavated or studied , lie along almost every one of this and neighboring fjords , where scattered areas spread flat enough to grow forage for the animals . GERTRUDE B. FIERTZ Summit , N.J. To the Editor : I read with interest the article on Greenland which pointed out that American tourists ' are " one in a million . " Small wonder , say I. The prices are so exorbitant that it would be much easier and certainly more realistic for that remote island to post a " Keep Out " sign at every point of entry . If the Greenlanders or the Danish are genuinely interested in promoting tourism to Greenland , they will have to come up with something better than $40 for a fishing license or $200 for a deer license , to say nothing of the high air fares and hotel rates . The very thought of Greenland is cold and forbidding and in order to convince anyone to visit there , it would take some high-powered promotional inducements even if they let you fish for nothing or shoot deer at will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is equally forbidding and even ludicrous . ERNEST BARRA Woodmont , Conn . The . Danish Tourist Board replies : Greenland appeals to people who are looking for an undeveloped , unspoiled and remote destination . Naturally , the cost of getting to and staying in such an area of the world is higher than what . applies to more traditional tourist destinations with well-developed hotel facilities and transportation networks . However , most tourists who have ventured to Greenland have enjoyed one of the most unusual and rewarding travel experiences . Attractions of Edinburgh To the Editor : . For those of us who are young in age or young at heart , Robert D. Hershey Jr . ' s article , " What 's Doing in Edinburgh ' ? ( Travel Section , July 15 ) , omitted a great event at the Edinburgh Zoo . Every day at precisely 3:30 P.M. , weather permitting , the adult papule. tion of the largest colony of Antarctic penguins outside their homeland take a stroll , or more properly , a waddle around the zoo grounds . This is a most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observe these beautiful birds parading by , heads held high and wings arched back . Unfortunately , this delight of children and photographers is poorly publicized : Even the Edinburgh Tourist Office was unaware of its existence . Nevertheless , it is not to be missed . BONNIE FRANK NIERMAN Philadelphia To the Editor : I was saddened to see that the Scottish . War Memorial in Edinburgh was referred to as " skippable . " It has been called " a cry in stone , " and I was moved to tears by it . MRS . L. C. WILLIAMS Lexington , Mass . To the Editor : I was disappointed that the long list of Edinburgh 's charms failed to include any mention of Greyfriars Bobby : On Candlemaker Row in Old Edinburgh stands a small fountain-statue dedicated to this plucky little Skye terrier who , for 14 years from 1858 , stood . watch over his master 's grave in Greyfriars Kirkyard , subsisting on handouts from area residents and children from a nearby orphanage . Later - immortalized in " Greyfriars Bobby " by Eleanor Atkinson ( a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city ) and subsequently in a Disney film of the same name , the legend of Bobby has entranced millions of children for years . It is a lovely and poignant lesson of loyalty and love strengthened by the fact that it is absolutely true . In the churchyard just across the cobblestone street from the statue is the grave of the dog 's master , John Gray ( " Auld Jock " ) ? almost always adorned with yellow daffodils . Bobby himself is buried nearby in an unmarked grave . On any given day , there is a steady stream of children and grown-ups alike posing for snapshots in front of Bobby 's statue , paying homage to the famous little dog and perhaps remembering their own faithful pets . ROBERT L. TUCKER New York Health Emergencies To the Editor : I would like to add another language , Esperanto , to the list entitled , " How to Ask for a Doctor in 15 Languages , " ' which accompanied the article " Rx for Health Emergencies Far From Home by Sheilah M. and Robert S. Hillman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mi bezonas kuraciston. " means " I need a doctor " in Esperanto , which we call " the second language for all . " The Universal Esperanto " associo " has a " jarlibro " ( yearbook ) covering 80 countries with addresses and phone numbers of Esperanto delegates listed . For example , when I contracted intestinal disorders in Mexico City , a physician associated with the local Esperanto Club took me to the pharmacy and provided the cure . I found him listed under " medicino " in the jarlibro . MARK STARR Queens To the Editor : In the list of ways to ask for a doctor abroad , the authors failed to include the Chinese language . With one fourth of the world populace living in China and an ever-increasing number of Western travelers to China nowadays , you may wish to add " yi sheng " to the list , which is " doctor " in Chinese . TSUNG 0 . CHENG , M.D. Washington To the Editor : Regarding the article on health emergencies abroad , anyone planning a visit to Denmark may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken from " Copenhagen This Week " May 1979 : " All foreigners staying temporarily in Denmark are entitled to free treatment in hospitals and casualty wards in the event of sudden illness or aggravation of a chronic disease , provided the patient has not come to Denmark with a view of obtaining treatment , or is not strong enough to return to home country . Transport home is paid by the patient . " WILLIAM A. WELLWOOD New Milford , N.J. Wolfgangsee To the Editor : The operetta " Im Weissen ROssl " cited by Alan Levy in the article on the Wolfgangsee , " An Outing on an Austrian Lake Has an Operatic Finale " ( Travel Section , July 22 ) , is distinguished from other operettas by one role that is both minor and major at the same time . When my husband and I attended a performance recently in Vienna , the second act was clearly the high point . The actor portraying old Emperor Franz Josef stepped off the boat to reMonument to Edinburgh 's plucky Greyfriars Bobby . ceive the homage of the populace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The cheering and applause went on for minutes as the symbol of the old monarchy stood bowing to us who were mostly born Long after the empire had been dissolved . When I told my brother about the incident on my return home , he explained , " What ! Did n't the audience rise to their feet ? " It appears that they do in Zurich , Switzerland , where theatergoers know the proper etiquette extended to royalty . Whether in Vienna or Zurich , when it comes to curtain calls , the actor playing the Emperor takes more bows than any of the stars . Is it that our intellect says " republic " while our emotion says ? ? monarcny " ? DORIT L. No ETHER Summit , N.J. To the Editor : In the article on the Wolfgangsee , author Alan Levy refers to the operetta " Im Weissen ROssl " and mentions that the play was based on a previous work . He fails to note , however , that the original book was written by my cousin Hans Mueller , who died in 1950 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I should set the record straight . HANA C. DAVIS New York To the Editor : I enjoyed Alan Levy 's article on the Wolfgangsee , particularly since I was a student at the Summer Campus of the University of Vienna in the quiet resort town of Strobl at the eastern end of the lake . I spent much of my time exploring the lake region 's many beautiful and historic spots , tasting such Austrian delights as marillenknoedel ( apricot dumplings ) and enjoying the breathtaking Alpine scenery afforded by the boat rides on the lake . The Wolfgangsee and the surrounding Salzkammergut region of Austria form one of the truly beautiful vacation areas I know of , virtually unknown to most American tourists but highly popular with the Germans , who are found in virtually every scenic spot of Austria and upon whose Deutsche mark the Austrian tourist industry has long relied . MATTHEW A. WOOLF Scarsdale , N:Y . To the Editor : It seems to me that the greatest of all . Austrian lakes is Lake Gosau , about 30 miles south of Wolfgangsee . This lake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Michelin " the most impressive in Austria . " Fodor also notes : " Baron Friedrich von Humboldt , the naturalist and traveler for whom the current off the west coast of South America is named , has called this lake one of the most beautiful spots in the world . " It is also credited with having inspired some of the music of Wagner 's " Parsifal . " Here the Dachstein glacier appears at the end of a range of mountains which ring the lake and the view of the glacier and mountains reflected in the lake is spectacular . Bad Ischl , our base town , from which we visited Lake Gosau is next to the imperial villa of Emperor Franz Josef where tours are conducted in English . Also in Bad Ischl is one of the most famous pastry shops in Austria ? Cafe-Konditorei Zauner . ROBERT WIENER Spring Valley , N.Y . More on Irish Spain To the Editor : I would like to comment further on the article by David Alpern , " Galicia , the Magnet for Pilgrims in Spain " ( Travel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Galicia as " Irish Spain . " The Spaniards themselves call this region " Irish Spain " for a number of reasons . One , of course , is the fact that it was settled heavily by the Celts ; secondly , in topography this verdant region with its moist Atlantic climate does indeed resemble Ireland , and thirdly , Galicia is believed to be the launching point for settlement of Ireland , pre-Celtic as well as Celtic . Galicia ? especially the city of La Coruna  --  was the destination of countless Irish nobles ( the Wild Geese ) and their families who fled British oppression in the 15th and 16th centuries . At one time there were eight Irish military regiments in the service of Spain , and some of the most illustrious names in Spanish history are of Irish origin ? to name only a few : O'Donnell , O'Donogue , Macarte ( McCarthy ) , O'Farrill . As the letter-writer Rosemary Rinder indicates ( July 15 ) , there are enduring ethnic similarities between the Irish and the Spanish , particularly the Galicians , but she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Celtic one . The latest archeological findings in Ireland bear out the writings in the " Book of Invasions " and other ancient Irish texts ? that the prehistoric inhabitants of the island migrated from Iberia ; and further , that the Milesian invasion of Ireland , which was Celtic in origin , also emanated from Spain , and specifically , from Galicia . JOHN R. MCBRIDE New York Chicago Revisited To the Editor : The article " Stephen Spender Views Chicago " ( Travel Section , July 1 ) cornmends the city for its writers of the past and for certain architectural features but in my opinion is too critical of present-day Chicago . He states that Chicago is a city of violent contrasts , and notoriously , of violence . True , Chicago has shared with other metropolitan areas the dilemma of decay in the central city as middleclass neighborhoods have surrendered to encroaching slums and former inhabitants halve fled to newer suburban fringes . However , it has waged an effective war against internal dilapidation as new buildings and complexes are rising and older residential areas are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would advise visitors to walk the length and breadth of it , and there 's no better place to start than the " Magnificent Mile " of - stores and shops extending the stretch of Michigan Avenue from Chicago River North to Oak Street . M. MARGUERITE DUNN New York Rail Improvements To the Editor : The article on European rail modernization ( Travel Notes , July 29 ) was most interesting , but it overlooked developments in Britain . British Rail has for years been working on an , advanced passenger train with a speed of 150 miles an hour . Service trials of the train are to begin this fall between Glasgow and Carlisle , and the train is expected to be in service between Glasgow and London by the end of 1980 . British Rail holds the world 's speed record fora passenger train in actual service . On April 10 one of its highspeed trains , which have been running for several years with a speed of 125 miles an hour , covered the 99 miles from London to Chippenham in 50 minutes and 32 seconds , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
