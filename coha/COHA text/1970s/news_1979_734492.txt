txt CHARLIE CIIAN was just relaxing in his reclining chair . Around him were his valuable antiques that decorated his comfortable three-bedroom , ranch-style house in Joplin , Mo . Charlie , though , was n't thinking about his estimated $250,000 fortune that also includes a seven-acre plot in nearby Diamond , Mo . Instead , Charlie wanted to chase his cloth mouse filled with catnip and roll around in the fine gravel that makes up his toilet . Charlie Chan is a 71/2-year-old , mixed-breed , white cat who happened to be the sole beneficiary in the will of his devoted owner , Grace Alma Patterson Wiggins . After she died of sound mind , the courts said , Charlie became a rich cat . " CHARLIE 'S A real man of means , " said Colleen O'Flaherty , 33 , a fourthgrade schoolteacher who lives with Charlie . Two years ago , she agreed to take care of and live with him if Charlie just would n't charge her rent . Charlie did n't . Miss O'Flaherty , in her own words , is " just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only does he own the home , she said , but Charlie also is the title-holder of seven choice acres in Diamond , will have a cat cemetery named after him when he dies , and will have the remainder of Mrs. Wiggins ' estate donated to national and local humane shelters in his name when he dies .

Miss O'Flaherty said Charlie ate chicken liver or beef kidney once a day but , unlike some cats in his income category , was not finicky and also ate " regular cat food . " Charlie does n't like to go outside , Miss O'Flaherty explained , saying he 's gotten so used to carpeting that the bare ground annoys him . He likes to roam around the house , she said , batting his ball of yarn , tossing around his catnip mouse , and rolling in his litter , after which he meticulously cleans himself . SHE ALSO said Charlie was quite the conversationalist . " When you come in , he talks to you , " Miss O'Flaherty said . " He meows , and chews and chews and chews . If you 're gone for a while , he gives you the idea he wants to know where you 've been and why you 've been gone so long . " However , when asked for comment by a reporter , Miss O'Flaherty said Charlie did n't care to be quoted .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
