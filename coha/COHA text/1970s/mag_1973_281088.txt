First they lost their cheerleaders , then their paychecks , and finally the New York Golden Blades lost their home and name . The cheerleaders , called the Golden Belles , were hooted off the ice for their hokey pregame shows . The paychecks stopped when the last-place team went broke and only resumed when the World Hockey Association stepped in to keep the team skating . Then the Blades were evicted from Madison Square Garden and forced to relocate in Cherry Hill , N.J. , a suburb of Camden , as the Jersey Knights . <P> The problems of the Blades-Knights are unique in degree but not in kind ; big-league hockey is in trouble . Average attendance in the W.H.A . is a dismal 5,200 per game . None of the twelve teams has turned a profit since the league was founded two years ago . In the established National Hockey League , where sharp play and packed arenas were traditional , attendance has begun to slip . and there is a shortage of top performers . " There used to be 18 true professionals on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Black Hawks star who is now player-coach of the W.H.A . Winnipeg Jets . " Now there 's an influx of mediocre pros , guys who do n't put out every night . There 's an inability to perform the fundamentals . The skating is n't keen , the passing is off , and the hitting is not strong . " <P> It is not difficult to find the reason . Hockey has expanded faster than any other professional team sport-so fast that it is still in a state of shock . The N.H.L. has grown from six to 16 teams since 1967 . The rival W.H.A . added another twelve . Staffing 22 new teams required increasing the number of pro skaters , more than 90% of whom are reared in Canada , from about 100 to more than 500 . Finding so many first-class prospects in hockey 's existing farm system proved impossible . <P> The dilution of talent has sent some teams scrambling to Europe , of all places , in search of players . The faltering Toronto Maple Leafs recruited two Swedes . The teams have also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this year contain 60 rookies , some of them getting $100,000 or more . At the other end of the age scale , Tim Horton , 43 , has been lured out of retirement to steady a young Buffalo Sabres defense . So has Gordie Howe , 45 , the legendary Detroit Red Wings star , who could not resist a big contract from the W.H.A . Houston Aeros to form the only father-son trio in hockey with his sons Marty and Mark . <P> The uneven level of players inevitably produces imbalanced play . " You can still see good hockey on given nights in both leagues , " says Hull , " but on other nights teams can stink . " Earlier this season , for instance , the impoverished California Golden Seals skated into Boston like somnambulists . Losing 4-1 , they challenged the Bruins ' goalie with only 19 shots during the entire game-offensive ineptitude equivalent to that of a football team that can not cross midfield more than two or three times in a game . The New York Islanders displayed their own brand of indifferent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 78 games while giving away twice as many goals as they scored .
