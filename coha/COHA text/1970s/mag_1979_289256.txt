In Oregon , a husband goes on trial for rape <P> In Galsworthy 's Forsyte Saga , Wife Irene wept in bed after she had been raped by her husband . The next morning , Husband Soames ate breakfast comforted by the thought that " no one would know-it was not the sort of thing that she would speak about . " Besides he had but prevented his wife " from abandoning her duty . " <P> Today such an act could land a husband in jail . On Oct. 10 , Greta Rideout of Salem , Ore. , was allegedly raped by her husband John . She called the local Salem Women 's Crisis Service , which advised her to call the police . That would have been unthinkable not only in Galsworthy 's England but even in Oregon until last year . Common law and most U.S. statutes were clear : with the marriage vows came the assumption of sexual consent . But encouraged by women 's rights advocates , the Oregon legislature changed the state 's rape law in 1977 to remove marriage or cohabitation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 21 , an unemployed cook , and charged him with raping his wife . Last week John found himself on trial awaiting the verdict of a jury of eight women and four men , and facing up to 20 years in jail . <P> Greta , who filed for divorce soon after the incident , claims that John chased her through a field near their apartment building , dragged her inside and raped her as their 2-year-old daughter watched and cried , " Mommy , Mommy ! " Defense Lawyer Charles Burt admitted that sexual intercourse took place , but he denied that John had used force . Greta kneed her husband in the groin , Burt told the jurors , and John then slapped her in the face . The defense portrayed the young couple 's rocky four-year relationship as " quarrel , make up , have sex . " <P> To undermine her credibility , Burt also painted Greta , 23 , as a sexually troubled woman . Her peccadilloes , admitted before trial , included extramarital affairs , two abortions ( one for a child not her husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she later denied ) . She enjoys the publicity that has accompanied the prosecution of her husband , said Burt ; according to witnesses , she announced that she is going to " be rich and famous " after signing a movie contract to tell her story . Before the trial Burt protested : " There are enough problems with the marital relationship without allowing one spouse to charge the other with a 20-year felony . " Husband John , he later told the jury , " honestly believed that if you are married to a woman you have a right to sex . " <P> That view may be losing ground . Delaware and Nebraska have adopted new laws allowing wives to charge live-in husbands with rape , and a similar statute in New Jersey will go into effect next September . More states permit wives who are separated from their husbands to charge rape , and women 's groups elsewhere are becoming vocal on the subject . They resent what Nancy Burch , director of the Oregon women 's center that Greta first contacted , calls the " archaic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The Rideout case is the first of its kind under the new laws to go on trial in the U.S. , but at least one woman in Nebraska has already filed a rape charge against her husband . After the Rideout case , there are sure to be others .
