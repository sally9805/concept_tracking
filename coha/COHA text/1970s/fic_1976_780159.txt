 | be drawn across her window . Most of the prostitutes were young , at least half of them were pretty , and the majority seemed bored . In one crib a girl was visiting with her neighbor , drinking a bottle of Coke while she chattered away . The young Arab reached the next intersection , crossed it , and went on . Lacey continued after him , keeping ten paces behind . This was a busier intersection , and girls were standing on the corners drumming up trade . A little blonde with steel-rimmed glasses smacked her lips as he went by . A few yards farther on a very tall brunette in knee-high leather boots smiled quietly at him . Lacey barely noticed them . He was thinking about Rembrandt . He had trained himself , when on the verge of completing a job , to think of some totally unrelated thing . It cleared his mind of small worries ; it kept his nerves from kicking up . Now he was trying to recall the details of The Night Watch . There was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he had been looking forward to seeing the original . Lacey knew he lacked a proper educationtwo years at Los Angeles City College did n't qualifyand he valued the opportunities his work gave him to discover the cultural riches of man 's past . However , this was a rush job and he had n't had the time to get over to the Rijksmuseum . He felt regretful about it . He could have used another day . The Arab stopped . Lacey stopped , too , keeping the same distance between them . The Arab turned and faced a crib that had its curtain drawn . He looked back at Lacey , then jerked his head toward the curtained window . Lacey nodded almost imperceptibly , just enough to let him know he understood his meaning . The young Arab turned away and sauntered on . Lacey stopped before the door of the crib and glanced around . Luckily , the window across the way had its curtain  | drawn also ; there was no one to observe him from that direction . He looked back up the street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with his head down , his face partly concealed by his raincoat collar , and waited for them to pass . As he waited , he prepared himself . He breathed very evenly and let his mind drain empty . A tune was running through his head , a tune he had heard on the radio in his hotel room just before he left . It was the melody of a popular American ballad , and at any other time he would have known its title , thought of the words that went with it . But now it was simply a nameless tune , a meaningless thing in his consciousness , like the pain in his callused foot . The two French sailors had gone on . Lacey unbuttoned his raincoat . Gripping the butt of the automatic , he threw open the door of the crib , stepped in , and quickly shut the door behind him . The man was on top of the girl , joined with her . The slam of the door broke their rhythm , halted it . Their heads turned toward him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide , astonished . But the man understood instantly , understood even before Lacey drew the gun . He sprang up from the bed . T le made no move to escape but simply stood there , his feet planted wide : a naked , stocky , bald-headed man who seemed more outraged than afraid . Lacey held the silenced automatic at arm 's length , aimed at the man 's forehead . But nothing happened . He was fascinated suddenly , too fascinated to squeeze the trigger , fascinated by each specific of the man : the tuft of gray hair at the center of his chest , the appendectomy scar on his abdomen , the wet maleness that was still half-erect . The man lunged at him . Lacey fired . The man 's head shuddered , but his momentum carried him onward . He collided with Lacey in a last drunken lurch of dying . Instinctively Lacey  | put up his left hand to block the entry hole in the forehead , to keep the blood from flowing onto him . He pushed the body away . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lacey 's palm . He reached into his raincoat pocket and took out a handkerchief , squeezing it to dry his hand . All the while , he kept the automatic trained on the naked girl on the bed . She was slim and young , no more than eighteen or nineteen . Her whole body was shaking . " Do you speak English ? " Lacey asked her . " Yes . " It was a barely audible , frightened whisper . " How old am I ? " Lacey asked . The girl stared at him uncomprehendingly . " I will tell you , " he went on . " I 'm quite young . I 'm only twenty-five . Am I tall ? " The girl hesitated . Then her lips moved , about to form the word " no . " " Yes , I 'm tall , " Lacey said . " Very tall . Six foot four . What color is my hair ? " The girl got the point now . " Blond , " she answered . " That 's right . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just remember that and you wo n't get hurt . " He tucked the automatic under his waistband . With both hands free now , he wiped the last of the blood from his palm . He put the handkerchief back into his pocket and buttoned his raincoat . The girl was staring at the dead man on the floor . " Who was he ? " she asked . " I do n't know , " he said .  | " We 're meeting the McAdamses for tea and sandwiches , " Sharon said . She took her eyes off the road for an instant , just long enough to catch his expression . She knew he was n't keen on the McAdamses . " Is that all right with you ? " " Their place ? " Lacey asked . " No . At the green . " " The green ? What for ? " They had conic to the tricky S-curve . Sharon leaned forward and concentrated on it . When she had flattened the S and left it behind , she answered , " The whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cricket ? Already ? " " It 's the first match of the year , " she said . " One of those theater teams has come up from London . You know , mostly stage actors . They 're supposed to be very good . They say it wo n't be much of a contest . But we have to be there to give our boys moral support . " " Our boys ? " He smiled at her . " Gone native , hon ? " Sharon smiled too , but she said nothing . His little joke was  | based on their assumed common attitude , that of hard-headed Yankees among the quaint , amiable , and rather backward English countryfolk . Actually , he knew , Sharon had come to feel quite at home in South Stoke , much more than he did . It was only natural ; she was there all the time , while his working days were spent either in the city or traveling abroad . " When did you tell the McAdamses we 'd meet them ? " he asked . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us much time . I want to take a bath . " " You 'll have time . I 've got a couple of kettles on the fire . " It took a second to register . Then he stared at her , dismayed . " Oh , no ! You mean , the water heater 's on the blink again ? " " Everything goes to hell when you 're away , darling . " " Did you call Mr. Studworth ? " " Of course . " " And did he say when he 'd be by to fix it ? " " He did n't want to be pinned down , " she said . Lacey gazed out the car window at the countryside , which still , even as he saw this strip of it for the thousandth time , seemed a bit unreal to him , with its picture-book too-green greens , and tried to be philosophic about the whole thing . If they had wanted comfort and function , they would have chosen a modern flat in London . Instead , they had opted for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be lived in in the first place . In the eighteenth century it had served as a hunting lodge for some nobleman . It was all aged wood and shuttered windows , and it was charming and delightful , but it lacked the guts of a living house . Just as the local workmen , the Mr. Studworths and the rest , with their ruddy Donald Crisp facades , their cap-tippings and their rituals of politeness , seemed to be missing some essential mechanism within them .  | He paused in the midst of these thoughts to wonder at the bitterness of them . He had thought he liked it in this serene village on the Thames . In general , he did . But right at that moment , dirty and tired from his business trip , with no proper hot bath to look forward to , he realized he would rather be back home in the States . " How was Amsterdam ? " Sharon asked . " It was all right . Just work . " " A big order ? " " Yeah . They 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machines to bedpans . " Sharon did n't pursue the subject further . She had never been able to work up much interest in hospital supplies . She had been more curious about his business in the past , when he had represented M. Lampros , exporter of fine Greek food and wines ; it was a line of goods that appealed to her . But now that he was working for Imperial Medical , she did n't want to hear more than a sentence or two . Lacey swung around in the seat and studied Sharon . He had become aware that there was something different about her , and he knew it would be politic to figure it out before too long . He checked her hairdoher reddish hair was short and curly as alwaysand her minimal makeup . Then he shifted his attention to her blouse . It was of some transparent material , with knit flowers fixed in it , and it looked unfamiliar . " That 's a new blouse , is n't it ? " " Very good , Alan , " she said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sharon was smiling now , and he went on gazing at her , enjoying the sight of her . She was n't remarkably pretty , and though she was some ten years younger , she was thickening at about the same rate as he . But when she smiled , she displayed that glory of American womanhood , a full set of even , white teeth .  | He reached out and squeezed her thigh . She did n't react , did n't take her eyes off the road . He ran his fingertips along the line of her crotch . " If you must feel me up , " she said , " then you drive , so I can really enjoy it . " He laughed and took his hand away . " I 'll be good , " he said . A minute later they pulled up in front of the house . Christine was the first one out the door , followed close behind by Jimmy . Lacey got out of the car and caught the two of them in his arms at the same moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I 've learned a new magic trick ! " " Hey , what 's this ? " Lacey had caught sight of Jimmy 's iodine-stained elbow . He lifted the boy 's thin arm to get a better look . The skin of the elbow was torn , and there was a beginning scab on it . " I fell , " Jimmy said . " What do you mean , you fell ? You were supposed to be in bed . " " It 's all right . His cough is much better , " Sharon said . " I 'll get your bath ready . " She went ahead into the house . " Daddy , I 've learned a new magic trick ! " Christine said again . She had been given a child 's magic set for her birthday , and she had been working up an act ever since . " Is it with cards ? " Lacey asked . " With flowers , " she said . " Okay , let 's go into the house and you can show it to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ran back in through the open doorway . He took his suitcase out of the car and followed . In the living room , Lacey put down his suitcase and looked around . He had been through this homecoming ritual countless times , but he always felt a warm jolt of rediscovery when he saw the familiar objects laid out in that unique pattern that was home .  | " You wait here , " Christine said to him . " I 'll go get the trick . " " No , wait a minute , " he said . " I 've got a magic trick to show you first . " Christine and Jimmy stared at him uncertainly . He had never presented himself to them as a magician before . Lacey took off his scarf and let it hang out full . He held it aloft mysteriously , fixing the children 's gazes with it . At the same time , with his left hand he palmed the chocolate bars that were still in the pocket of his raincoat . " Notice , " he said , flapping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Would anyone from the audience care to look ? " He held out the scarf to Jimmv . " Young man ? " Jimmy smiled and shook his head timidly . Lacev brought out his left hand and lost it in the scarf . Very quickly he crumpled the scarf between his hands and made a ball of it . " And now I say the magic words . Abracadabra and hubba hubba ! " He held out the balled-up scarf to the children . It was suspended gingerly between his fingertips , as if it might contain something either very dangerous or very valuable . " Which of you wants to peek ? " Christine 's hand shot out greedily . She had already guessed that it was a goody . She groped within the folds of the scarf and came out with a Van Houten 's chocolate bar . When Jimmy saw the chocolate , his timidity vanished . " Oh ! " he cried out excitedly . He eagerly pawed the scarf and quickly found the other Van Houten 's bar . " Now promise you wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hide them away so she does n't see them . Okay ? " " Okay , " Christine said . She was carefully peeling away the cellophane . " What 's this ? " Jimmv asked . He held up his chocolate bar . There was a red smear on the underside of the wrapper . Lacey stared at the stain on the paper , and for a moment it puzzled him . His first thought was that he might have cut  | himself . Then he remembered . His hand on the moist entry hole . . . blood on his palm .. . " Let me see that . " He snatched the chocolate bar from Jimmy . He pretended to study the red smear . " It 's nothing , " he said . " Just some paint I was working with . " He tore off the wrapper , gouging the chocolate in his haste , crumpled it in his hand , and dropped it into an ashtray . He bit into the chocolate . " Um , good , " he said . He held out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it without looking at it . Both he and Christine were staring at Lacey , and their eyes were uneasy . " Take a bite , Jimmy . It 's terrific , " he insisted . Jimmy solemnly bit into the Van Houten 's bar . But his gaze held on his father , and he hardly seemed to be tasting the sweet chocolate . The water , tepid to start with , turned cold very quickly . Lacey did n't linger in it . He got out of the bathtub , toweled himself briskly , then put on his terry-cloth robe . He left the bathroom and went into the bedroom . Sharon had put a pot of tea and a copy of the London Times by the armchair . He sat , poured himself a cup of tea , and flipped through the newspaper . He happened upon the item almost at once . It was at the bottom of a page , not much more than column-filler , but his eye was caught by the heading over the Amsterdam dateline : " AMERICAN FUND RAISER KILLED . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of his jobsa quick look to make sure he had left no clues , and that would be it . The less he knew about a target the better . After the fact , there was no point in knowing . But now his attention was compelled by that one word : " American . " He carefully read through the item :  | Aryeh Berman , 46 , was shot and killed by an unknown gunman on a side street in the Zeedijk district last night . Mr. Berman was a prominent fund raiser for the United Jewish Appeal . He was a U.S. citizen and a resident of New York City . Police officials say there is no apparent motive , but they speculate that it may have been an Arab terrorist assassination . Normally , Lacey would have felt nothing in particular as he read the item . At the most , he might have been slightly amused by the discreet revision that had placed the victim on the street rather than in a whore 's crib . But now there was a tight , cold sensation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected it ; the item had shocked him . Quite simply , he had never killed a fellow American before . Not that it should make any difference . Lacey put aside the newspaper , took a sip of tea , and tried to be sensible , tried to put the thing in perspective . It was ridiculous to be chauvinistic about it . A human being was a human being , after all . A target was a target . Nationality should n't figure into it . And yet it did matter . The target had n't been some babbling Greek , some nut-brown , desert-bred sabra , or some coldeyed , fanatic Russian , raised from the cradle to be as loyal to the Party as a zombie . He had been an American , someone who had shared common experiences with him , who had listened to the same radio programs as a kid , gone to the same movies , worshipped the same ballplayers . He had n't been an incomprehensible alien , some dream figure from one of a hundred dream countries . When Lacey had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the blood of someone as real as he . Is that why he had hesitated ? he wondered . On the trip back , he had puzzled over that peculiar moment of paralysis . He had never hesitated on a job before . He would n't have  | survived this long if he had . In his work he had to be swift and sure . He could n't afford to falter . Yet this time there had been those agonizing few seconds when he had n't been absolutely sure he would pull the trigger . But , no , that could n't have been the reason . He had had no idea the target was an American . And the man almost certainly had n't guessed that Lacey was , either . If he had , he would have spoken ; he would have said something , if only to curse him . Instead , he had simply stared , then lunged hopelessly at him , assuming , in his last moment , an inability to communicate . If he had hesitated , he knew it was because he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ target , with his moist penis and his almost comical look of outrage , the outrage of a man who has been indelicately interrupted in his pleasure . The job had been improperly planned . He should never have been asked to liquidate a man at such a moment . Aryeh Berman . The name sprang up in his consciousness . It was unwelcome there . Lacey did n't like to attach a name to a target . He preferred it when a target was simply a spot the color of flesh or of suit fabric , caught in the crosshairs of a telescopic sight . Or , if he had to get close to a target , he would rather it were someone he did n't see too clearly , but only glimpsed for a moment on the street just before he fired . Best of all was when he never saw the target at all , when it was merely a matter of rigging an explosive charge in an automobile engine . Lacey , of course , had no inhibitions about killing . But , at the same time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to persist in his work by keeping it quite impersonal . Ideally , it should always be as it was with that first target long ago , that cotton-quilted Chinese , whoever he was , on the frozen Yalu . He thought back on it now , as always , without regret or  | remorse . He thought back on it as a plain fact of lifehis first kill . It was a gray target in an oncoming line of gray targets , all faceless in the gray dawn . He fired his clip ; then , where he had seen the running target , there was a bundle of cotton quilt on the ice . He could recall himself exactly , the pulse and feel of the boy he was , a seventeen-year-old Marine , one of thousands like him , school kids who had joined the Reserves for kicks , then were called up to fight in Korea . But in his memory the target never quite became a person . It was a cotton-quilted bundle on the ice , as innocent in its stillness as he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make a big deal out of these things . He himself had never willed anyone dead . A target was dead the moment the higher-ups gave the order . He was only the instrument . If he did n't do it , someone else would . It made no difference . And yet he felt chilled now . His body had dried and the air in the room was no rawer than usual , but he was shivering slightly . He drew his robe more tightly around him . He had been working too hard . There had been a lot less strain in the old days . In eight years of employment with the Company , he had killed only nine men . The CIA had a certain sense of restraint when it came to violence . Or perhaps it was simply that U.S. foreign policy had nothing in it like the hysterical frenzy of this Arab-Israeli thing . Whatever the reason , it was very different for him now . In a year and a half of working for the Arabs , he had already killed ten men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would start to crack after a while . " Daddy ? " It was Christine . She was outside the door . " What is it , sweetheart ? " " Hurry up ! We 'll be late for the cricket game . " " I 'll be out in a minute . "  | Aryeh Berman . Damn it , it 's just a name ! Forget it ! One more , he decided . One more , and then he 'd call it quits . " Good ! " Doug McAdams grunted appreciatively . He had lowered his glass of warm beer for a moment to concentrate on the cricket players . " Bowled him out , he did . I like that fellow 's form . Pity he is n't with us . We could use an off-spin bowler . " " I do n't expect he 'd hit it off with our boys , " Joan McAdams said . " He 's awfully light on his feet . " " Queer ? " McAdams looked at his wife quickly to make sure he had divined her precise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those actors tend to be that way . What do you think ? " he asked Lacey . Lacey shrugged . " Well , if he 's a good off-spin bowler " He tossed off the term confidently , though he had no clear idea what it meant . " Anyway , what difference does it make ? I mean , was n't the Battle of Britain won by them ? " McAdams 's eves narrowed . " Won by whom ? " " Queers . The RAF . " When there was no response , he helpfully added , " Gay but brave . " McAdams 's fat red face was stony . " I should n't think you 'd want to talk about things you do n't know anything about . You could sound like a bloody idiot . " " Easy now , Doug , " Joan McAdams said soothingly . " I 'm sure Alan does n't mean any offense . " " I really do n't , " Lacev said mildly . It was true enough . He had simply been referring to something he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He did n't seem as ready as his wife to forgive the insult to the nation or its manhood , or whatever the issue was . Lacey found himself wishing that Sharon would come back .  | She should n't have left him alone with this boob . The McAdamses were her project , not his . The man was an estate agent who worked in Chelsea , and he and his wife had moved out from the city just six months before . Sharon , good-hearted type that she was , had gone out of her way to extend invitations to them and , in general , to try to make them feel welcome in their little village . It had hardly been necessary . McAdams already acted as entrenched as a squire . And he treated the Lacevs with amiable condescension , as he would any transient Americans who had inexplicably lingered on where they did n't belong . " Sorry , " McAdams said finally . " Did n't mean to get so touchy about it . But , you know , I put in my time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Englishman 's view of the Great Conflagration . They had fought a war . Lacey had had some experience with combat , but he rarely mentioned it . For instance , for almost a quarter of a century he had been carrying in his left shoulder two tiny slivers from a grenade . Flow they had got there was a story he never told . Perhaps it was because that war was a war that did n't tell well . It did n't make any more sense to him now than it had then . " Hoy was your trip ? " McAdams asked . " Did you sell much of whatever it is you sell ? What do you sell ? " " Urinals , " Lacey replied . It was the answer he usually gave when he wanted to discourage questions about his business . It worked . McAdams coughed and became suddenly aware of the half-eaten cheese sandwich on his paper plate . Joan McAdams smiled remotely and gazed out over the green . " Excuse me , " Lacey said , rising , " I 'd better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He surveyed the crowd . It was a good turnout ; every table was taken and people were standing all along the edge of the  | green . He picked out Sharon and Christine almost immediately . Sharon was at another table , chatting with some village friends . Christine was standing with two other little girls in front of the " pavilion , " the rather grandly named shack which served as both a dressing room for the players and a snack bar for the spectators . The little girls were intensely discussing whatever it is little girls discuss . Jimmy , however , was nowhere in sight . Lacey weaved his way between the tables , muttering an " excuse me " whenever he narrowly missed stepping on someone 's toe . The spectators , an odd mixture of plain villagers and spiffy London theater people , paid no attention to him . Something exciting had happened on the playing field , and they were exhaling breathy little cries of praise . When he got past the table area , he saw Jimmy . He was kneeling on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fists were clenched and he was shaking them up and down with excitement . " What happened ? " Lacey asked as he came up to him . " Did n't you see ? " Jimmy pointed out onto the green . " He hit a six ! " " Is that good ? " " Sure it 's good ! " Jimmy looked up at him with scorn . " Do n't you know ? " " I 'm afraid I do n't . Cricket is n't my game . " " He hit it all the way into the next field . " " You mean , it 's like a home run ? " Jimmy nodded , but Lacey was n't sure he really knew what he meant . " I guess the pitcher is n't so hot after all , " Lacey commented . " They were just saying he was such a terrific off-spin bowler . " He paused , then ventured , " I suppose you know what that means , too ? " " Sure . When the bowler bowls the ball , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to indicate an angled bounce to the left . He said it very patiently , as if he were explaining to someone even younger than he , a three-year-old , perhaps . " Okay , " Lacey said , " if you 're so smart , then tell me this . What 's a triple play ? " Jimmy frowned with perplexity . " I do n't know . " " A triple play , " Lacey explained , " is a very thrilling play in a game called baseball . ' That 's a game they play in America . And I hope someday you see a triple play with your own eyes . " " Oh , " Jimmy said without interest . His gaze wandered back to the cricket players . Lacey just stood there , feeling a bit foolish . He had sounded phony , and he knew it . The truth was , lie had n't ever seen a triple play either . But he had been trying to make a point , a point that was wasted on this limey son of his . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it still did n't seem right to him that a little boy , American by blood and citizenship , should grow up worshipping men in white sweaters and white pants who played positions with names like " gully " and " wicket-keeper . " What kind of names were those for athletes ? There was n't a position on that field that had the blunt , virile sound of " shortstop . " He saw Sharon approaching . She had finished with her gossip and was coming to join them . He went toward her and met her part-way . " Who 's winning ? " she asked . " Does it matter ? " He took her by the arm and started to draw her away . " Let 's go for a walk . " " Now ? " She seemed a bit puzzled by his curtness . " I want to talk . " They skirted the crowd , walked to the far edge of the green , and went through an opening in the hedge . On the other side , there was a large meadow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they started down it .  | Lacey remained silent until they had walked half the length of the meadow . Then he stopped and turned to her . " Sharon , " he said , " Jimmy does n't know what a triple play is . " Sharon smiled tentatively , on the chance this might be some deadpan joke . " I 'm not sure I know , either . " " You 're not supposed to know , " he said . " You 're a woman . But boys should know what a triple play is . American boys . " " Well , you have to allow for the situation . Jimmy has n't spent more than five or six weeks of his life in the States . " " I know . That 's the problem . He 's growing up as a goddamned limey . Both the kids are . They think like limeys , they sound like limeys . Not even classy ones . They talk like the people here . " " Not exactly . You 're exaggerating . " " Okay , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " it 's something in between . Between the wav we talk and the wav they talk . They 're neither one thing nor the other . " " They 're happy , Alan , " she pointed out mildly . " It 's not right , " he insisted . " American kids should grow up as Americans . The same as we did . " " So , what do you want to do ? " He was silent for a moment . Then he voiced it , the idea that had been on his mind all afternoon . " It 's time we thought of going home . " " All right , " she said . There was dutiful acquiescence in her tone and little else . Perhaps a slight apprehension . Sharon had lived in England even longer than heten years . After finishing business college , she had gone to London in a spirit of adventure , had lucked into a job with an American firm , and had remained . It had meant a new beginning for her , a new life in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faintly exotic and socially respectable , more so than in her former existence as the daughter of working-class Slovaks in Paterson , New Jersey . Lacey , too , recognized the appeal of their present life , and  | for much the same reasons . His young manhood in southern California had been , in most ways , no more satisfying than Sharon 's adolescence . But still he had his memories and his continued yearnings . So he pressed the point . " Life would be better for us there now , " he said . " If you say so , " she murmured . " You do n't think so ? " She smiled wanly . " It would mean an adjustment . " " Of course . We always have to make adjustments . " He studied her expression , noted the anxiety in her eyes . " What worries you ? " " I do n't know . " She shrugged . " It just sounds soso scary back there . The tension . The violence . I got a letter from my cousin Ruth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had mentioned it to him before , but now she repeated the whole thing to him again . " A black man with a knife . She gave him her money . Then , for no reason at all , he slashed her arm . She had to have ten stitches . Some crazy drug addict , I guess . " " That could happen in London , too . " " Not very often . " " It could happen , " he said . " It could happen anywhere in the world . Do n't worry about it . Violence is overrated . " Sharon was silent for a moment . Her mouth tightened slightly , as it always did when her thoughts turned to practical matters . " You 'd arrange for a job , first ? " " No job , " he said . " I 'm through working for other people . " " What would you do ? " " Retire . Or semiretire . " " At your age ? " she asked incredulously . " Now 's the best time , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You ca n't just do nothing at all .

But maybe we could really do it . " " Do what ? " " We could buy a motel in some nice spot in California . Around L.A. , or down by San Diego . By the ocean . I love the ocean . " She was staring at him in wonderment , as if he had suddenly started to babble insanely . " Alan , " she said gently , " we do n't have the money . " " I could get it , " he said vaguely . He did n't dare be more specific . The truth of the matter was that Lacey had a hundred and forty thousand dollars stashed away in a variety of savings accounts . But Sharon had no idea of it . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonder how he had acquired it . And he had always been very careful never to give Sharon any reason to suspect . So he had kept the secret and had put off the enjoyment of his rewards . The Arabs paid him ten thousand per job . But he never touched a penny of it . The fee always went directly into the bank . And Sharon and he went on living within the confines of a salesman 's income , or almost . The money in the bank was for the future . Well , it was time . The future had come . An assured future . But now he had to make it seem plausible to his wife . " I could take out a loan , " he said . " You 'd be going in over your head " " Let me worry about it . " This silenced her .

" she murmured .  | " I know , " he said . " But it 's not our home . It never can be . We 'll always be freaks here . " She met his gaze , took his hand , and smiled . Her smile acknowledged their intimacy , their dependence on each other in the midst of their isolation . " You 're right , " she said . " It 's time to go home . " She kissed his lips lightly , putting a seal to the agreement . After a moment , she asked , " Will you quit your job right away ? " " No , " he said . " I 'll have to give notice . It wo n't be easy , " he added . She , of course , could n't know how really difficult it was . His resignation would have to be handled with great delicacy . A disposal man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ associates . It would make people too nervous . " Oh , " she said , a bit disappointedly . " I was hoping this meant we 'd be together from now on . You 'll still be going away on business trips ? " " One more , maybe . " Yes , one more , he thought . That would make it a hundred and fifty thousand . It was a nice round figure . " One more , " he said , " and that 's it . "  | There was a pale circle on the fake mahogany finish of his desk top . Someone had left a wet bottle on it . Lacey took out his handkerchief , moistened a bit of the cloth with saliva , tightened it around his finger , and tried to scrub away the irksome ring . While he was doing this , Heatherington entered the office , punctually late as always by exactly ten minutes . He threw his hat and coat onto the coat-tree , then came over to look down at Lacey as he scraped at the near-ineradicable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " he asked jovially . Heatherington fancied himself something of a humorist . " If someone else befouls it , " Lacey said . " Do n't look at me . " Lacey , in fact , was n't looking at him at all . " I do n't know who did it . Honest injun ! " This was Heatherington 's idea of a current American phrase . " And if I did , I do n't know as I 'd tell you . " A cooing slyness came into his voice . " Might be one more thing to go into the old report , eh , Lacey ? " Lacey looked up at the man , took note of this morning 's  | details of himthe natty plaid sports jacket and the knowing smirkand tried to make allowances for him . Heatherington , he knew , thought he was a company spy . He could hardly be blamed for it . It was the only logical explanation to the paranoid lower-middle-class British mind . " Would you do me a favor , Heatherington ? " " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salesman 's smile held firm . " Chap ca n't even try to be friendly anymore , " he said . He turned and sauntered away , leaving a wake of cologne and genial malice . This little interchange had left Lacey faintly annoyed , but he tried to put it out of his mind . He turned his attention to the stack of letters on his desk , Baker 's correspondence . As usual , he was doing another man 's work . In this case , it was for a legitimate reason ; Baker was in the hospital , recovering from a gallbladder operation . But at other times he would be assigned to another salesman 's territory for a period of days or weeks with seeming capriciousness . The displaced salesman , who generally was healthy and functioning , would never be given an explanation . As a result , Lacey had become both a mysterious and an unpopular figure at Imperial Medical . He had no territory of his own , and it was evident that he knew somewhat less about hospital supplies than anyone else on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the most senior salesman . It was small wonder that Heatherington , and perhaps some of the others also , had come to imagine that he was some kind of sneaky efficiency expert , checking up on his colleagues ' work and then tattling to the bigwigs . It was just as well . The truth would have seemed even more unpalatable . The Arab sympathies of the lord who owned the company were no secret ; he expressed them publicly often enough . But what no one knew , or hardly anyone , was that  | Alistair Chubb , the sales manager of Imperial Medical Supplies , was a full-time agent of the Arab cause , an entrepreneur of systematic terror . This , if it had come to light , would not have gone down too well . Heatherington and his fellow workers might not have been averse to the anti-Semitism , but they would have been shocked by the methods . Lacey tried to concentrate on the letter before him . A Glasgow hospital was ordering fresh supplies . Norseal sheeting .. . conoco bandages . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the requested items , a sense of bleak ennui crept through him . At such moments he felt he could not have been given a more tedious cover job . He would n't have been there at all , he reflected bitterly , if it had n't been for a piece of dumb luck . Or too much sun on a hot summer day . Then again , maybe it had n't been a matter of luck at all . That Yalie prick , Sullivan , had wanted him out all along . From the time Sullivan came into the picture , from the time they had put Lacey under his command , all the pleasure had gone out of working for the Company . Sullivan was the prissy type of CIA official who thought of himself as a gentleman and a patriot , which made him two kinds of hypocrite right off . He affected a civilized distaste for " wet affairs . " This did n't keep him , of course , from setting up a liquidation with the best of them . But it was obvious that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That was work fit only for Greeks , Cubans , Hungarians , and other such ignorant savages . If a native-born American like Lacey happened to be a disposal man , there had to be something wrong with him . Sullivan had looked upon him , not as a loyal public servant , but as a hoodlum . No , the chemistry had been bad between them . From the very beginning Lacey had sensed that Sullivan was waiting for the first misstep to get rid of him . And , as it was bound to , it happened . A silly incident . But even now Lacey 's cheeks tingled as he remembered it .  | Maybe it had been the sun . They had set him up in a sniper 's roost on a steep , parched hillside . He was under a rock overhang . It concealed him from anyone above , and it protected him from the sun for part of the day , but for part of the day only . At about two o'clock , the sun 's raysit was the hot , untempered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . He had a canteen of water and a bottle of retsina with himenough to quench his thirst , but not enough to cool the building fever in him . By sundown he would feel as giddy and disoriented as if he 'd been kicked in the head . This went on for four days . They had no one inside the summer house with the target and his party , so there was no way of knowing when the target would decide to leave . Each day , Lacey waited in his hillside roost , keeping himself ready for that moment when the target would walk down the pier toward the waiting boat and , at the very end , move into the crosshairs of his telescopic sight . This time , Lacey knew something about the target . He was a big man in the junta . Now , for some reason , they wanted to liquidate him . Maybe he had been found out as an agent for the other side . Or maybe he had simply grown inconvenient . Whichever it was , it was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to any Greek . So there Lacey was , the anonymous outside specialist . He imagined it would be blamed on the KGB . In the meantime , while he waited he was going mad with boredom and heat . He could n't pass the time admiring the scenery ; there was n't too much to look at . It was a small island , rather barren , not one of the pretty or populated ones . From where he was perched , he could see directly before him the target 's summer place , to the right the sea , and to the left , several hundred yards away , another hill . A small temple was at the top of this hill . The first day , he barely glanced toward the temple . It was a little too far away to make out the details , and , anyway , he had seen his share of classic ruins . The second day , he peered  | at it more attentively . It was n't a ruin at all , he realized . It seemed almost perfectly preserved . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was like a little marble toy , left behind by forgetful children . On the fourth day , the sun was even fiercer than before . It beat at his eves , red haze . His gaze returned to it again and again . It looked so cool and restful . All that day , there was no sign of activity in or about the summer house . The target and his associates , he assumed , were conferring in some rear room . It neared five and still he had seen no one . Another futile day of waiting was coming to an end . There was a buzzing in his head and he could taste blood on his cracked lips . He looked at the temple , and this time his gaze was fixed by it . He stared at it for long minutes , hypnotized by the gleam of the white marble . He imagined the coolness of the shade at the very center where the sun never touched . Then , impulsively , without stopping to think , he hid his rifle and tripod , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hill . He hurried along the dirt road that led to the next hill , the hill with the temple . As he approached the base of it , he happened upon a group of youths lounging beside the road . Lacey did n't see them until he was almost abreast of them ; a clump of bushes had screened them from his view . Now he felt a vague consternation . He had thought the hill was deserted . The youths had knapsacks and long blond hair , and they were passing a bottle among them . Lacey caught a phrase or two of their chatter ; they were Germans , vagabonding it for the summer . One of the youths looked up at him and smiled . " Amerikanisch ? " he asked . People always seemed to know he was an American .  | " Ja , " Lacey said , and started to walk past them . " Hey , " another one called out in lightly accented English , " you want to drink some ouzo with us ? " " No , thanks , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his step seem purposeful , as if he had some special mission at the top of the hill . He climbed the path that led to the temple . Halfway up , he glanced behind him . The English-speaking youth was following him up the hill in a leisurely fashion . The expression on his blond-bearded face was pleasant . He evidently just wanted to be companionable . The temple turned out to be only about thirty feet long . Two rows of Ionic columns supported a graceful , unadorned roof . It seemed too modest a structure to have served for the worship of any major god . Lacey guessed that it might have been erected for the sake of some local deity . The marble was discolored , severely weathered , but , amazingly , it was barely eroded . Lacev entered the temple , went to the center of it , and found the pond of cooler air . As he stood there , a sense of awe came over him . It was n't that the temple was so beautiful . It was simply that it had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mortality . He knew how to touch the soft spot in a living thing and extinguish it . It moved him that anything human , even an idea preserved in marble , could endure over the centuries . The blond-bearded young German was standing just outside the temple , smiling as he watched him . " You like it ? " he asked . " To think that this has been here for thousands of years ! " Lacev said wonderingly . The German looked perplexed . " This ? It 's a modern imitation , " he said . " Ca n't you tell ? " Lacey turned away , embarrassed . As he did so , he caught sight of the summer house in the distance . Several tiny figures were walking down the pier toward a waiting fishing launch .  | For one shocked moment he had an impulse to run , wildly , incautiously , all the way back to his roost . But it would have been useless . There was nothing Lacey could do except stand there in that fake temple on the hill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ target . This was n't the way he told the story to Sullivan . He could n't be honest about it ; his lapse had been just too idiotic . So he told Sullivan that a German hippie had approached him in the vicinity of the roost . The German had said that a friend was having drug convulsions . Would Lacey help find a doctor ? He could n't refuse ; it would have aroused suspicion . And so he had gone with the German to the hippie encampment at the next hill . The drug overdose turned out to be a false alarm . But , unfortunately , just at that time the target unexpectedly departed . Sullivan made him tell the story twice . Then he asked , " How do you know this was n't a trick to lure you away ? " " Well , I do n't know for sure , " Lacey said . " If it was a trick , then it means they 're on to you . You 've been identified . And if that 's the case " Sullivan paused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be of much use to us anymore . Lacey sat there , seething , but unable to say anything . He knew that Sullivan did n't believe his story . But the son of a bitch was pretending to believe itjust so he could have the excuse to fire him . For the next six months , Lacey floundered . He tried to find another job in the import-export field , but his heart was n't in it . He was n't a salesman by nature , and he knew he was n't very good at the work . There was only one craft he had really mastered . And now he was denied the opportunity to practice it . He was just about ready to give up and go back to the States . The prospect frightened him . He had n't been able to make a living there before . Now , with a wife and two children to support , would he have any better luck ?  | But his savings had dwindled to almost nothing . It seemed he had no choice . Then , one morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Mr. Alistair Chubb , Esq. , sales manager of Imperial Medical Supplies . He wished to meet with Lacey . There was a possibility of employment with his firm . So there he was , a year and a half later , more successful than he had ever been . And , as he dully absorbed the letter from the Glasgow hospital , the quicker part of his mind was seeking the phrases with which to give his notice . They would have to be very exact , those phrases , very precisely chosen . It could be fatal for him if he was misunderstood . He looked up and saw Chubb 's stout , middle-aged secretary coming toward him . She was carrying her handbag , which meant she was on the way to the bathroom in the hall . As she passed him , she said , " Mr. Chubb wants to see you , Alan . " Lacey rose from his desk slowly , reluctantly . He would have liked to have more time ; he still did n't know how he was going to go about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and knocked on the door . " Come in , " he heard . He opened the door and entered . Chubb was standing at the table with his tea things laid out before him . A steaming kettle was poised in his hand . " Just in time for tea , Lacey , " he said . " Oh , good , " Lacey murmured unenthusiastically . He did n't share Chubb 's passion for cloyingly sweet Arabic mint tea . Lacey watched as the sales manager went through his teabrewing ritual . Chubb dropped some green tea into a narrownecked teapot of chased silver , then poured in the boiling water . Next , he took a sugarloaf from a rectangular silver box and knocked off some chunks with a small hammer . He poked the chunks of sugar down the neck of the teapot . From another rectangular silver box , he collected a spray of perfumed fresh mint . This too was thrust into the teapot . Chubb went through these steps solemnly , with great concentration . With his dark beard and languorous brown eyes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tea for a guest in his tent . " There ! " Chubb said , when he was done . " It should be ready in a minute . " He gestured to the chair beside Lacey . Lacey sat . Chubb eased himself into the chair across the table from him . Between them , the mint tea steeped in its silver pot . After a moment Chubb said , " Things went well in Amsterdam , did they ? " " I have an order for over a thousand pounds ' worth of " " The other thing , " Chubb said . " Yes . No problem . " " Good . You did an important job for us there , Lacey . You do n't know how important . " Lacey said nothing . He , in fact , had no idea how the target had figured in the scheme of things . Aryeh Berman . There it was , that name again . " I did n't know " he began , then broke off . " Did n't know what ? " " That he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that out ? " " Read it in the Times . " " It should n't make any difference , " Chubb said coldly . " Berman was a top agent for Israeli intelligence . We 're well rid of him . " " Yes , I suppose so , " Lacey murmured . He did n't feel like pursuing the subject further . Chubb 's gaze momentarily fixed on the silver teapot , as if he were gauging the progress of the brewing tea . Behind him , through the window , Lacey could see the Barclay 's bank across the street . It was a very ornamental Barclay 's , with a green turret , a balustrade , and a gargoyle topping one window . Beneath the gargoyle , a pallid clerk was visible , poking at a Comptometer . At length , Chubb said , " I had a funny report from Amsterdam . "  | " What did you hear ? " " They said that Berman was with a tart . " Chubb looked at him with mild astonishment . " And you let the girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was it ? " " I would n't know . You 're the expert , not I. But was n't that rather dangerous ? I mean , the girl could identify you , could n't she ? " " She wo n't , " Lacey said . " The girl was scared out of her mind . Anyway , " he added , " I do n't believe in killing people for no good reason . " Chubb clearly did n't accept this . The faint perplexity remained in his eyes . " You would n't be tender when it comes to women , would you , Lacey ? " " No , " Lacey said . " It 's got nothing to do with it . Men or womenit 's all the same thing . " And he looked away , because he knew he was lying . A frightened teen-aged girl was not the same thing . Chubb turned his attention to the tea , which was ready now . He poured a cup for Lacey , then one for himself . Lacey took a dutiful sip of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if he were playacting it . It just was n't a normal thing , to be sitting there in a commercial office on Great Portland Street , a Moorish carpet under his feet , a cup of mint tea in his hands , discussing the proper procedures of murder . He had the uneasy feeling that he had become an incongruous figure in an incongruous picture , like the clerk totting up sums under the grinning gargoyle . Chubb peered at him . " You seem down , Lacey . Everything all right ? " " Well , not really , Mr. Chubb , " Lacey replied . " It 's my mother . " It had come out of nowhere . A flash of inspiration . The perfect excuse . " Your mother ? What 's wrong ? " " I just got a letter from her . She 's ill . " " Nothing serious , I hope ? "  | " I 'm afraid so . Cancer . " Chubb looked appropriately dismayed . " Oh , that 's too bad . Flow old is she ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She have someone to look after her ? " " She lives in a senior citizens community . I contribute to her support , " he went on . " My brother helps , too . As best he can . But he does n't make muchhe works in an aircraft factoryand he 's got his wife and kids to worry about . So , mostly it 's up to me . " Chubb nodded gravely . " Mothers can be a heavy responsibility , " he said . " They just do n't kick off clean when we come of age , do they ? They dwindle away . I 've got my own , living with my sister in Cornwall . " Lacey let a moment of mutual pensiveness pass . Then he said , " I 'd like to take a leave of absence . " " A leave of absence ? " " Yes , sir . " He stuck by the phrase . It was better than saying " I quit . " He would take his leave , get involved with personal matters , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lacey , " Chubb said , " this comes at an awfully busy time . " " I do n't think I 'd ever forgive myself if she died without my seeing her . " " Yes , yes , of course . " Chubb thought for a moment . " All right . I 've got one more job for you to do right away . Then you can go home for a while . " " How soon is this job ? " " You leave tomorrow . For Rome . " " Will I be kept there long ? " " It should only take a couple of days . " Lacey nodded . " Okay . " Chubb smiled gently , sympathetically . " We all have to cope with tragedies , " he said . " We 'll see that you get home to your mother . But until then " a pointed firmness came into his tone " we have to keep our minds on our work . "  | The steward was pushing the newspaper wagon up the aisle . As it approached their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting next to him would take , an English or an Italian newspaper . He was a bit puzzled by her . Over the years , he had acquired the knack of guessing a person 's nationality at a glance . It was a sensing quicker than thought , an instant recognition of a particular mix of clothes , physical type , and bearing . But with this girl the mix was inconsistent . He was fairly sure that her outfit , a violet pants suit , was American-made ; it looked as though it might have been purchased at one of the more expensive New York stores . At the same time , he doubted very much that she was an American . He had first noticed her during the passenger search at the departure gate . Lacey had already gone through , and he was sitting in the little bus , looking out the window , watching carefully as each person was checked out . He felt no particular anxiety about hijackers ; he was studying the procedure for professional reasons . Each passenger 's hand luggage was gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the passenger was frisked . The men accepted the indignity impassively , almost with boredom . But the women reacted with varying degrees of nervousness , resentment , and shock . A blue-uniformed female was frisking the women . She was a bleached blonde with a face so heavily made up it seemed to be a rouged , waxen mask . She was very thorough ; her impersonal hands searched out every recess of a woman 's body . One gray-haired , tweedy Englishwoman glared at her as if to say , " Just you watch what you 're doing ! " The next person , a plump American woman , erupted into giggles and tried to elude the persistent hands . Throughout , the blue-uniformed female never showed a glimmer of expression . Then the girl walked up to her . She was slim and beautiful , and at first glance it was hard to tell whether she was a grown woman or not . Her straight , dark hair was cut in a gamine style ; it gave her an almost childlike appearance . But her carriage was proud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prima ballerina . She gazed serenely into the blank eyes of the blue-uniformed female , and there was a slight smile on her lips . Her smile was neither condescending nor intimate . Rather , it was the assured smile of an aristocratic innocent , one who has faith that , whatever strange hands may be laid on her , she can not really be touched . For the first time , the blue-uniformed female faltered . Her hands became almost deferential on the girl 's body . She broke off midway , leaving her task barely done . Lacey looked at this girl in the Fifth Avenue outfit and thought , she ca n't be an American . It takes a thousand years to develop that kind of style . So now he watched as the girl leaned forward from her aisle seat and picked out a newspaper . It was II Tempo . " Grazie , " she said to the handsome steward . " Prego , " the steward replied . Lacey took a copy of the Daily Express . Then he wondered  | why he had bothered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harold Wilson in hot water and a poisoner 's murder trial . Ile did n't need to read any of that a second time . He put the newspaper on the empty seat between the girl and himself and gazed out the window . All he could see was a cloud bank , some five hundred feet below . It did n't matter . After countless flights , he had lost his taste for the look of the world from a plane window . It had been different years before when he had taken that first long flight across the ocean . Then the Boeing 707 had seemed like some great fairy-tale bird , and each small event of the trip , from the martini to the plastic dinner , had been an adventure . His destination then was Paris . There was no particular reason for it . But he was of that last generation of young Americans who still saw the French capital as a city of magic , where you cast off your old skin and were instantly transformed into Gene Kelly tap-dancing along the Seine . Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kid , and he had no illusions . He expected no romantic metamorphosis . All he planned to do was bum around for a while . But still , it meant something new and exciting . And he had nothing to lose . The only thing he was leaving behind was a failed diner . His brother and he had tried to make a go of it . Neither of them had had any previous business experience . But Lacey was bored with working in the claims department of an insurance company , his brother could n't make a living with his saxophone , and so they decided to take the plunge . The diner seemed a can't-miss proposition . It was on the highway , on a new detour ; there was bound to be truck traffic and a fresh flow of passenger cars . The trucks never came . And the drop-in trade from private cars was n't enough to save them . After a year , their little bit of capital was exhausted . So he got out . He was ready for faraway places . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he met in Paris , Mr. Cartwright , who seemed to be vaguely connected with the embassy , asked him to personally carry a message to Marseilles , that was fine , too . In his first year of working for the Company , the jobs never amounted to much more than that . He was a part-time courier and go-between . There was some intelligence work . He attended student conferences , made up meticulous lists of names , but he doubted that anything he reported ever had any real value . Still , it kept him in pocket money , and in the Cold War climate of the period he felt faintly heroic and patriotic . One thing led to another , and he never did go home again . There was a sudden white flash in the cabin . Lacey looked up quickly . An idiot tourist had just taken a Polaroid photograph . The man , a balding American in a short-sleeved sport shirt , was standing in the aisle , waving his wife and young son into position for another shot . The woman and boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He realized he was now part of the composition . Lacey picked up the Daily Express , unfolded it , held it before his face , and pretended to read . He waited . In a few seconds , there was another white flash . " Are you famous ? " He lowered the newspaper . The girl in the aisle seat was smiling at him . He smiled back at her uncertainly . " Why do you ask ? " " Because you would not let your picture be taken , " she said . " That means you are either famous or very shy . " Her voice was friendly . He guessed that she was Italian , though he could n't really tell from her accent . It was soft and unobstrusive . " I 'm shy , " Lacey replied . " Also , I 've got a thing about having my picture taken . Are n't there primitive people some-  | where who are afraid that when someone takes your picture he steals your soul ? " " Are you so very afraid of losing your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After a moment , he realized she was teasing him . " All the time , " he said . " What about you ? I suppose you made sure you got into the photograph ? " " Oh , yes , " she said brightly . " I smiled very nicely for the camera . " Well , maybe you 're used to it . Are you a model ? " " No . What makes you think that ? " It was a disingenuous question . She was beautiful and certainly she knew it . Her mouth may have been a little too full , but her light-blue eyes had a startling clarity . Her complexion was pink and white , and it would have been flawless had it not been for a single red pimple on her cheek . The blemish enhanced the suggestion about her of a lingering adolescence . Dutifully Lacey answered , " Because you 're so pretty . " " Thank you . " She acknowledged the compliment with a quick nod . " I am a painter . " " Can you make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she admitted . " Actually , I have been teaching art . " " Where ? " " In New York City . " As if to forestall his next question , she added , " A small technical school . You would not have heard of it . " " You seem too young to be a teacher , " Lacey commented . She frowned . " How old must you be to teach ? I am twentyfour . " " Oh , that 's very old , " he said with mock gravity . " Yes , indeed , it is , " she insisted . He had the feeling she was only half-joking . " If you do n't believe it , ask my mother . She thinks I am already a " She broke off . " What is the word ? It begins with s . ' " " I do n't know . "  | " An old lady who is not married . " " Spinster ? " " A spinster , yes . And my fatherhe is afraid , because I am not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a convent . To him , one is as bad as the other . " " With concerned parents like that , how did you end up in New York ? " " I went there for the hell of it . " She laughed , pleased with herself for using the earthy American phrase . " You see , I am a very bad daughter . " " I doubt that 's true , " Lacey murmured . The girl gazed at him , smiling , for a silent moment . Then she announced , " I am Isabella . Isabella Fratti . " " I 'm Alan Lacey , " he said . " Alan Lacey , " she repeated . " You have told me nothing about yourself , Alan Lacey . " " What do you want to know ? I live in England . I represent a hospital supplies firm . I 'm going to Rome on business . " " Oh ! " Isabella said it brightly , then she paused , as if she were momentarily at a loss for anything else to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Just a couple of days . " " Me too , " she said . " Only a few days . " " Does n't your family live in Rome ? " " No . We are from Tuscany . " " Where ? " " I do n't think you would know it . A little city called Lucca . " Lacey thought for a moment . " Sounds familiar . I think I may have come across it browsing through my Michelin . " " Michelin gives it two stars . " " Well , that 's good , is n't it ? " Isabella wrinkled her nose , as if she were miffed by the guidebook slight . " We think it deserves more , " she said . " Lucca is a beautiful old walled city . Puccini came from there  | and Boccherini . But it has never had a first-rate painter . " She shrugged philosophically . " It loses us a star , but it saves us from the world . " " I 'm from Santa Monica , " Lacey said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " That is in southern California ? " she asked uncertainly . " It 's part of Greater Los Angeles . " " I have never been to Los Angeles . " " It can wait . " They were silent for a few moments . At length he asked , " Are you stopping off in Rome to see friends ? " " Yes . And to attend to a private matter . " Her expression became serious , as if she had been reminded of something disturbing . Then it brightened again . " My friends will be angry with me . " " Why ? " " I was supposed to be in Rome yesterday . I missed the plane . " She made a rueful face . " Too many parties . " " Do you often miss planes ? " " No , this was the first time . But I am sure it will not be the last . " She smiled helplessly . " I am very disorganized . " They lapsed into silence again . Isabella began to seem restless . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . " How much longer , you think ? " He checked his watch . " We 've got over an hour . " She picked up her newspaper , then put it back on her lap . " Do you know any games ? " She asked it with hopeful eagerness , as a child might . " What kind of games ? " " To pass the time . When you were little , did you play games ? On trips ? " Lacey tried to remember . " Well , " he said finally , " when we used to go on long car trips , sometimes we 'd play Botticelli . " " Botticelli was a painter , " she said .  | " It 's also a game . " " How do you play it ? " " You think of a person . Let 's say you think of Botticelli . You give me the letter B. ' Then I try to stump you by asking you about people whose names begin with B. ' Like , I might ask you , Are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , No , I am not Beethoven . ' " " Okay , " Isabella said cheerfully , " I will think of someone . " She concentrated . She did n't seem to be able to come up with anyone right away . Her eyes wandered to the photograph on the front page of her newspaper . " I am ready , " she said . " What 's the letter ? " " K " Are you a former president of the United States ? " " No , I am not John F. Kennedy . Hey , this is easy ! " she said delightedly . " Do n't get overconfident . That was just to give you the idea . " He thought . " Are you a former third baseman of the Minnesota Twins ? " " Who are these Twins from Minnesota ? " " A baseball team . " " I know nothing of baseball . That is not fair , " she protested . " Sure it 's fair . Can you tell me ? ' No ? Harmon Killebrew . Now I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to answer yes ' or no . ' All right ? " She nodded . " Are you in politics ? " he asked . " Yes . " " Um-hmm . Are you the secretary of state of the United States ? " A look of consternation came onto Isabella 's face . " If the answer is yes , ' " Lacey said , " you have to say it . " " Yes , I am Henry Kissinger , " she said reluctantly . " You are  | very good at this game . " She gazed at him wonderingly . " Or do you read minds ? " " Well , to be honest , I saw you glance at that picture . " He pointed at the photograph of Kissinger on the front page of Il Tempo . " Then you are very observant of people 's eyes . " " I suppose I am . " The steward brought them their lunch trays . Lacey was content to drop the game , but Isabella wanted to play it further . So they played Botticelli @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the DC-8 began its descent toward Rome . Isabella , once she got the hang of it , proved to be more than a match for him ; she was particularly well informed about movie stars and people in the arts . Lacey , however , was playing the game with less than total concentration . As they batted the questions and answers back and forth , he was thinking about Isabella , and about all the other women he had met in his travels . He was remembering all the fragmentary beginnings , all the relationships he had n't allowed to happen . He had always kept his mind on his work . He had never let anything distract him . As a result , he had been damned lonely . And , if he went about things as usual , he was going to be lonely again in the next couple of days . Maybe this time he should relax a little , follow up on a beginning for once . It was his last business trip , after all . But then , how could he be sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but she was probably just killing time on a boring plane trip . He was much older than she wasseventeen years older , to be exact . Once they were on the ground , she would return to her young world and her young friends . Well , he could only try . He waited until the plane had landed and was slowing to a  | stop . Then he said , " You know , I 'd like to see you again , if I could . " " Yes , that would be nice . " She said it quickly and brightly . For all he knew , she was simply being polite . " Would you like to have dinner with me this evening ? " " I must be with my friends this evening . " " Then what about tomorrow evening ? " She considered him for a moment . " Yes , " she said , smiling , " I would enjoy having dinner with you . Tomorrow evening ? " " Great . " He took out his pen and notebook . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So I ca n't say exactly what time . I 'll have to call you . Where are you staying ? " " I am staying with my friends . The man 's name is Antonio Rinaldi . I do n't know the phone number ; you will have to look in the book . But the address is 63 Via delle Muratte . It is near the Trevi Fountain . " He wrote down the information and put away his notebook . " I 'll see you , then . "  | On the front of the Hotel Imperiale , there was a memorial plaque . These words were inscribed on it : In questo albergo soggiorno ENDRE ADY ( i8771919 ) poeta del destino dei desidiri dei sogni delle nazione ungherese As he went up in the elevator with the elderly bellman , Lacey repeated the resounding phrases in his mind . Del destino , dei desidiri , dei sogni . Destiny , desires , and dreams . He envied that earlier tenant , that Hungarian , whoever he was , his baggage . There was a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little hotel . The elevator let them out on the top floor . The bellman led him to his room and opened the door . Lacey went in . The  | room was so murky that at first he could barely see anything . The bellman searched around for the suitcase stand , which evidently had been misplaced . Finally he found it . He put Lacey 's suitcase on the stand and turned expectantly . Lacey gave him a five-hundred-lire note . The bellman thanked him and left . It was a high-ceilinged corner room with tall windows which were actually , he realized as he looked at them more closely , two pairs of French doors . Where there were French doors , he reasoned , there must be balconies and sunlight . He went to one pair of French doors , tugged on a pulley , and drew up the metal blind on the outside . He went to the other French doors , opened them , and pushed a pair of large wooden shutters outward . Now the room was flooded with blazing sunlight . He stepped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could see the wide plane-tree-covered curve of the Via Veneto , sweeping upward toward the more fashionable hotels and cafes . Directly across the way , he saw the Church of the Capuchin Monks . A rotund monk emerged from a street-level door . Lacey watched him , charmed by the sight of him , a fat little monk in a rope-belted brown habit , standing befuddledly on the hot modern asphalt . He seemed befuddled for only a moment . Then , with a delicate , shuffling step , he went over to a gleaming Lancia that was parked in front of the church , opened the door , got in , and drove away . Lacey went back in , unlocked his suitcase , and started to hang up his jackets and trousers . A couple of large flies had come into the room . They were buzzing around him furiously , but he ignored them . They would just have to learn to coexist . When he was through hanging up his clothes , he took out his notebook and checked the phone number of the San @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the phone receiver , and asked for the number .  | The hospital administrator had a cordial phone manner . But , for all his geniality , he did n't quite conceal his disappointment that Mr. Riordan had n't made this trip . Riordan , as Lacey knew , was a well-liked salesman . Lacey did n't extend the conversation . A few pleasantries , and then he made an appointment to see the administrator the next day . When he had finished the phone call , he lay back on the bed and tried to relax . It was five minutes after four . He still had twenty-five minutes before he was due to meet his contact . Through the French doors he could see the upper stories of the buildings on the Via Veneto . They were all of a height , and together they formed a great , pastel-colored arc of stone . Swallows circled above the rooftops . All in all , he was n't unhappy to be back in Rome . He had fond memories of the city . He had stayed there for some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in fact , that his career had begun . It had been an accidental beginning . A fluke incident . But , he supposed now , there had been something inevitable about it , too . He was becoming more involved in the Company 's operations . Sooner or later , something like it might have happened , at some other time , some other place . As it was , it had happened on a street in Rome , a dark , medieval , blind alley of a street , somewhere near the Piazza Navona . The image of it came back to him . The target 's nightclub was at the very end of the alley ; the door and the sign above it faced out toward the main street . It was closing time , but the sign was still lit and the name of the club was clearly visible : " Navona loon . " Lacey was leaning against the door of the car , which was parked opposite the mouth of the alley . He could feel the vibration from the idling engine . His hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was the lookout . If the carabinieri arrived unexpectedly ,  | he was to fire a shot in the air to warn the others , then drive away as fast as he could . The others would make their escape through the rear of the nightclub . He had been recruited at the last moment , almost in desperation , it seemed . He had never been involved in a CIA black operation before . And he could tell that the team leader was a little nervous about him , as if he feared he might panic . Lacey , in fact , was quite calm . He felt only a certain unsatisfied curiosity . No one , of course , had told him any more than was necessary . He had studied the photograph of the target , as had everyone in the team ; the man had a pale , furtive face and what seemed to be dyed black hair . But he had no idea why this Italian nightclub owner had to be liquidated . Well , it did n't really matter . He felt sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking longer than it should . Lacey was starting to get worried . Suddenly , the door of the nightclub flew open . A man came running out . It was the nightclub owner . He was fat and fortyish , but he ran with speed and fluidity . Figures appeared in the open doorway , but they did n't emerge into the alley . No one chased after the fleeing man . The cautious CIA men did n't want to chance it . The nightclub owner was coming straight at him , a broad target , upright and moving smoothly . It was an easy shot . When the slug tore into his heart , the man jerked convulsively in midstride , like a marionette whose strings have been yanked . Lacey did n't even wait for the body to land on the pavement . He knew the man was dead . He jumped into the car and drove away at a moderate speed . His superiors were impressed . They questioned him about himself , something they had never really done before . They asked him in detail about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the specifics of his training , what weapons he had mastered . Later on , another man , a stranger to him , questioned him alone . Lacey suspected that he was a psychologist.  | This man questioned him on a more personal level . He wanted to know why Lacey had fired at the nightclub owner . It was n't his job ; no one had asked him to do it . He could simply have let the man run off into the night . Why had he done it ? What was he thinking when he did it ? Lacev could n't remember what he had been thinking . But he answered as best he could . He felt he was part of a team effort . He did n't want to see all their work go for nothing . He was presented with a chance to do the job himself . So he did it . It would have seemed irresponsible not to do it . Anyway , it was such a simple shot . And they were going to get the man sooner or later , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with then and make it easier for everyone ? The psychologist nodded expressionlessly and jotted down a few notes . Afterwards , the Company found new work for Lacey . He became a disposal man . And now , ten years later , here he was in Rome again . It was where it had started . It was the appropriate place to end it . He glanced at his watch . It was time . It was a quarter after four , and , to be on the safe side , he was allowing fifteen minutes for the walk to the Piazza di Spagna . He unfolded his neap of Rome , refreshed his memory of the streets , folded the map again , put it in the inside pocket of his jacket , and went out . When he came out of the hotel , he looked around , searching for a newsstand . There was one farther down the street , near the Piazza Barberini . He walked clown to it and bought a copy of the Rome Daily American . Then he went back up the Via @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long flight of stone steps that led to the Via degli Artisti . At the top he could see the pink stucco facade of the Irish Franciscan College and the towering palm tree in its courtyard . On the Via degli Artisti , he turned left . As he walked , he went over the lines of dialogue , the bit  | of conversation that was to be used as identification for the contact and himself . Chubb seemed to delight in composing the most inane interchanges for this purpose . This one went : " Are you Mr. Martin ? " " Yes . " " I know your Uncle Henry . " " A splendid fellow . " If he were a police officer , Lacey thought , and he overheard two men talking to each other in this idiotic fashion , he 'd arrest them on the spot . When he reached the Via Sistina , he turned right . He passed a women 's boutique . There was a manikin in the window dressed in a suede outfit . The chic , slim manikin made him think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Isabella . He smiled as he remembered their conversation . That encounter was about the nicest thing to happen to him on a business trip in some time . Suddenly he felt a bit anxious . What if she made some excuse when he phoned ? There was nothing durable about these plane trip flirtations . She might have second thoughts about having dinner with a middle-aged stranger . Isabella was , after all , nothing like the mixed-up , sad girls he had come across in his work . She was a stylish beauty , one of the better class of European women . He could imagine her having elegant suppers with counts and film directors . Could she really have taken an interest in him ? Or had she just been polite ? No , he was fairly sure the girl had meant it . He wanted to believe it , certainly . At forty-one , Lacey was painfully aware of the fat that had settled in around his waist , of the gray that had crept into his sideburns . He was happily married , not lacking for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ youthful romance , the kind he saw in movies , was still at least possible . Well , he would find out soon enough . He just hoped the job would n't interfere . With luck , he would already have it out of the way . Then he could concentrate on enjoying Isabella 's company while they relaxed over a good dinner at some fine restaurant .  | He arrived at the square in front of the church of Trinity dei Monti . He went to the top of the Spanish Steps and looked down . Far below , at the bottom of the steps , was the Piazza di Spagna . People were sitting around the edge of the fountain in the center of the piazza . At that distance , the figures were small and indistinct , and he could n't even guess if one of them was his contact . He walked down the Spanish Steps . All around him belts and metal jewelry were spread out on blankets . The vendors who were hawking them were uniformly young and , for the most part , clad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a teen-aged girl in an ankle-length peasant dress and headband was nursing her infant while she held up glinting specimens from her display of silver earrings , trying to tempt some tourist with them . At the far side of the steps , near a row of quite bad watercolors , a guitarist had attracted a group of likeminded youths , and together they were singing a song that had an American country-and-western sound , but Italian words . When Lacey stepped down into the Piazza di Spagna , he went over to the boat-shaped fountain . A dozen or so people , young and old , were sitting on the edge of the basin , forming an oval around the fountain . A thin , long-haired young man , bare to the waist , was bathing in the water that spouted from the prow of the great marble boat . He was splashing his armpits and vigorously rubbing his chest . He seemed to be all ribs , and the water clung to the indentations on his torso . Lacey walked slowly around the fountain , glancing at the faces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a more than usual interest in him . None of them did . Then he too sat on the edge of the basin . As he had been instructed , he placed his copy of the Rome Daily American on his left knee . The minutes went by . Four-thirty came , but still no one approached him . He was gazing at the stretch of sidewalk in front of the house on the right of the Spanish Steps . He imagined , for no particular reason , that the contact would  | come from that direction . A large plaque on the house announced that John Keats had died in it . But Lacey was n't thinking about dead poets . He was wondering what he would do if the contact did n't turn up . He had no other way of getting in touch with whoever was his control on this job . The thin young man had finished washing himself , and now he was putting his shirt back on . He sat beside Lacey as he buttoned up . " Are you Mr. Martin ? " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a handsome , oliveskinned , southern Italian face , and his smile was open and cheerful . " Yes , " Lacey replied . " I know your Uncle Henry , " the young Italian said . " A splendid fellow , " Lacey said . There was an awkward pause . Having spoken their assigned lines , there seemed to be nothing more to say . " Do you always stop to take a bath when you 're working ? " Lacey asked . The young man looked at him uncomprehendingly . It occurred to Lacey that the code sentences might be all the English his contact knew . " I know your Uncle Henry , " the young man said again . " A splendid fellow , " Lacey replied dutifully . The young man rose and gave him a friendly tap on the arm . " Andiamo . " Lacey got up and followed him . They went up the Via del Babuino . The young man walked briskly , with a careless , assured stride . At one point he stopped to call out a laughing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lambretta . The girl waved without looking back , and the young man turned for a moment to admire her behind as it was borne away from them . They walked for several blocks . Then , just beyond the English church , the young man stopped before a shop . Moroccan caftans were on display in the window . The young man peered  | through the glass , then , gesturing to Lacey to follow , opened the door to go in . There were two people in the shop . An Italian salesgirl was sitting behind the counter near the entrance . A short , delicately built Arab in a tan suit was coming forward to greet them . " Ecco it signor Martin , " the contact said . " I am very pleased to meet you , Mr. Martin , " the Arab said . " I am Aziz . " Lacey shook his hand . " Is this your shop ? " " Yes . These are all my designs , " Aziz said , indicating his goods with a prideful little gesture . Lacey turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rack . " Very attractive , " he commented . " I may want to pick up one of these for my wife . " " Yes , Mr. Martin , " Aziz said . " We can discuss that . I will give you a very good price . Come with me , please . " Aziz went to the door of the office at the rear . Lacey followed . The contact sauntered along after them . Aziz turned back as he was opening the door . " Grazie , Renato , " he said to the contact . " Aspetta qui . " The young man stepped back from the door . Aziz and Lacey went into the office . Unlike Chubb 's office on Great Portland Street , it was devoid of Moorish splendor . It seemed , in fact , like the plain , functional office of an English businessman . Aziz closed the door . " Did you have a pleasant trip , Mr. Lacey ? " he asked . " Yes , thank you . Very pleasant . " " You and Renato @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No trouble at all . Does Renato work for you ? " " Sometimes . " " He seems a light-hearted soul . " " Renato ? " Aziz shrugged . " He has spent most of his life in prison . I do n't know if that makes one light-hearted . " He  | went over to a side table and picked up a straw-covered bottle of Valpolicella . " Would you like some wine ? " " I do n't think so . " " Please , " Aziz insisted gently . " All right . A small glass . " Aziz brought the wine bottle , along with two glasses , over to the desk . One of the glasses , Lacey noticed , had already been used ; there was some leftover wine at the bottom . Aziz filled the fresh glass halfway and placed it before Lacey . He filled the other glass to the brim and sat at the desk . Lacey sat opposite him . Aziz raised his glass . " Salute . " He took a large , compulsive swallow . When he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drinking , was watching him . " Does something bother you ? " he asked . " I guess I 'm not used to seeing a Moslem drink wine . " " When in Rome " Aziz murmured . " I have lived here a long time . Also , I was never a very good Moslem . " Lacey took a sip of the wine . " Nice , " he said . " You like it ? " " It beats mint tea . " " I know . " Aziz raised his glass to drink again . His hand was shaking slightly , and he spilled a few drops of the wine onto himself . He looked down at his suit jacket , then slapped vexedly at the purple spots on the lapel . " Excuse me , " he said . " I am a little upset today . I had some bad news this morning . " He gazed at Lacey somberly . " A very dear friend of minewe were students together in Fezwas murdered . In Paris . " " Who murdered him ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ briefly contorted with hatred . " They blew away half his face . " " I 'm sorry . " " Yes . They have murdered quite a few of us this past year . "  | He looked at Lacey thoughtfully . " Have they learned about you yet , Mr. Lacey ? " " I do n't believe so . " Lacey put down his glass . " Can we get to business ? " " Yes , of course . " Aziz sat back . His expression was composed again . " We have a task , " he said after a moment , " a task that requires a certain expertise . That is why we sent for someone of your skill . " " I understand . What 's the job ? " " It is a job , " Aziz said carefully , " that must not seem like what it is . " " It should seem like an accident ? Or a heart attack ? " " That is correct . She must seem to suffer a heart attack . " " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told ? The person involved is a woman . " He remembered Chubb 's question : You would n't be tender when it comes to women , would you , Lacey ? Now he understood why he had asked it . " There was some hint of it , " he said . " And since this person is a woman , " Aziz went on , " it would not look good for our cause if anything bloody or obviously violent happened to her . You understand ? " " Of course . " Even terrorists had their chivalrous image . It was bad enough to have to do this job in the first place . The hypocrisy made it all the more distasteful . Aziz opened the lower drawer of his desk and took out a plain cardboard box . It was the kind of flat , lidded box that might contain a necktie or a pair of gloves . He placed it on the desk before Lacey and removed the lid . " Do you know what this is ? " Lacey looked at the contents of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a half-inch in diameter , a vial of pills , a small bottle of glass ampules . " Yes , " he replied .  | " Have you used it before ? " " A couple of times . " " Please , " Aziz said , " to reassure me , explain this instrument to me . " " It 's a poison gas tube , " Lacey said . " It was developed by the KGB . It contains a firing device and a glass ampule filled with prussic acid . A spring sets off a small charge which crushes the ampule . The poison sprays out as a vapor . When the target inhales it , he dies immediately , with all the symptoms of a heart attack . " Aziz looked impressed . " You are a very knowledgeable man , Mr. Lacey . " " I know my work , anyway . " He closed the box and put it on his lap . " Are the time and place arranged yet ? " Aziz nodded . " The time is five o'clock tomorrow afternoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the bank of the Tiber . She will be alone . There should be no problem . " " How will I recognize her ? " " It is a quite deserted spot . A woman standing there alone at five o'clock will certainly be the right person . " " Where is this place ? " " Do you know the Ouattro Capi bridge ? " Aziz asked . " No , " Lacey said . " But I can look it up on my map . " " On your map , it will be called the Ponte Fabricio . That is the real name . But the Romans call it the Quattro Capi . Because it has four small heads on it . " " This woman will be standing on the bank of the Tiber beside this bridge ? " " Yes . " " You 're sure she 'll be there at five ? It wo n't be any later ? " " We are reasonably sure . " Aziz looked at him curiously . " But why would it matter so if it happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just that I have a dinner date . I would n't want to be delayed . "  | " I assure you , Mr. Lacey , " Aziz said quietly , " this will not interfere with your dinner . " " Good . " Lacey rose and slipped the cardboard box into his folded newspaper . " Thanks for the wine . I do n't suppose we 'll sec each other again . " " Of course not , " Aziz murmured .  | The next morning , after he had brushed his teeth , he took one of the pills . It was an antidote pill , and you were supposed to take one a few hours before you used the poison gas tube . Immediately afterwards , you were supposed to break an ampule and inhale the enclosed vapor . This was a reinforcing antidote . Lacey was n't sure that all this was absolutely necessary . But he had faithfully obeyed the instructions whenever he had used the instrument . In his work , it was best to follow orders exactly . When he came out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the phone receiver , and asked the portiere for the number of Antonio Rinaldi , 63 Via delle Muratte . He waited while the portiere looked up the number and dialed it . There were two rings , and then a male voice answered . " Pronto . " " Isabella Fratti e la ? " Lacey asked . His accent was evidently as blatantly American as ever , because the man switched to English at once . " Who is this , please ? "  | " Alan Lacey . The man she met on the plane . " " One moment , please . " There was a pause , then Isabella came onto the line . " Hello , Alan ? " " Surprised to hear from me ? " " I was waiting . I was afraid maybe you forgot . " " Not likely . Is it still on for tonight ? " " Yes , of course , " she said eagerly . " Good . Then where should we have dinner ? " After a moment she said , " I like Da @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go there sometimes . " " If movie stars go there , that settles it , " he said . " Should I pick you up where you 're staying ? " " Yes , please . I would like you to meet my friends . Do you know how to come here ? " " I can look it up on my map . Now , what about the time ? " he went on . " I have a couple of business appointments this afternoon . I should be through with the last one by six . " " Later would be better . I too have an appointment . " " An appointment ? I thought you were on vacation . " " Not really a vacation . I have a private matter to settle . " " Will it be settled by eight , do you think ? " " I hope so , " she said with a little laugh . " I 'll see you at eight then . Ciao , Isabella . " " Ciao , Alan . " His first appointment went smoothly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Lacey made his pitch for the new equipment his company was offering , but after a few minutes the administrator politely reminded him that Italy was on the verge of bankruptcy . His hospital 's funds were very limited . In the end , the administrator gave him a modest order , a simple reorder of the essential supplies . Lacey was through at ten minutes past four . When he came out onto the street , he was uncertain as to what he should do  | next . There was n't time enough to go back to the hotel , and he did n't want to sit in some cafe . With nothing to do but sip a cappuccino , he would start to worry about the job . He had to be at the Ouattro Capi bridge at five . From his study of the map he knew that the bridge was by the Ghetto . Just below the Ghetto were the Capitoline Hill and the Roman Forum . That was it . He could kill some time at the Forum . He went over to the Corso @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was there . He paid his two hundred lire at the gate . He paused to buy a guidebook , " The Roman Forum and the Palatine , " then went in . There was a midweek scattering of tourists wandering through the ruined center of the Roman world . Ahead of him as he entered , a crop-haired schoolmarm with a determined step was leading a band of English schoolgirls into the House of the Vestal Virgins . He checked the diagrammed plan in the guidebook , refreshing his memory of the place . Then he walked toward the western end , where the columns of the Temple of Saturn rose high on a grassy slope , dominating the ruins nearby . He passed the Lapis Niger , the black marble that was supposed to mark the tomb of Romulus . There was an excavation beneath the black stone ; it revealed a very ancient sepulcher . At the corner of the sepulcher was a pyramidal slab with a mysterious inscription on it that no one could read . Lacey had gone down into this excavation ten years before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oldest , coldest hole in the world . He did n't linger now . He went on to the Rostra , clambered up the fragments of steps behind it , and stood on the remains of the platform . When last he had done this , he had been a young man in jeans and moccasins . Now he was wearing a business suit and carrying a briefcase . He knew how incongruous he must look  | on this great stone platform where emperors once had stood to address their awestruck subjects . He gazed down the Sacred Way , trying to visualize the scene . The Temple of the Divine Julius , marking the spot where Caesar 's body was burned , was directly before him , less than a hundred yards away . The Senate House , where Caesar was murdered , was very near on his left , only twenty-five or thirty yards away . He was struck by how close together everything was . With a whole empty world around them , these ancient Romans had placed their public buildings and temples right on top of each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought as he looked at the meager opening before the Rostra , must have consisted of a couple of hundred people , all of them about four feet tall . He climbed clown from the Rostra and walked over to the Senate Houseor , as the guidebook called it , the Curia . This was a completely restored building , with three large windows high up on the facade and a peaked pediment . He went inside . A guard was talking with a very old and bent Italian woman . A teen-aged girl in a miniskirtthe old woman 's granddaughter , probablystood beside them , with a slightly bored expression on her face . There was no one else inside the Curia . Lacey went up to the wooden railing that barred the public from the Curia proper and studied the interior . There was a rectangular marble floor with a colored design set in it . Several steps running the length of the floor rose on either side . At the end , raised higher than the steps , was the presidential platform . Two large anaglyphs with bas-relief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The guard was opening the gate in the wooden railing to let the old woman and her granddaughter onto the senate floor . Lacey looked at him uncertainly . The guard beckoned to him to follow . Lacey did . The guard led them to the anaglyph on the right . He was  | speaking in rapid Italian to the old woman , explaining , Lacey assumed , the pictorial representations on the stone . He motioned to them to come behind the anaglyph . On the back side , the side that could not be seen from the entranceway , were a pig , a sheep , and a bull . The guard explained these , too , to the old woman . Suddenly he turned to Lacey . " Americano ? " " Si , " Lacey replied . " Sacrifice , " the guard said . Lacey nodded . They walked on , continuing in a circuit around the interior of the Curia . They traversed the presidential platform . The guard , the old woman , and her granddaughter went on , but Lacey lingered . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marble floor , the broad steps on the sides . He imagined rows of togaed senators sitting in chairs on these steps , all of their heads upturned to him . The thought of it made his skin prickle . He felt a vague sense of deja vu , as if he had once actually stood on this very spot in some other life . Who was he kidding ? he thought . He would have been no emperor , no consul . He would have been a weary legionnaire , a recruited barbarian , killing on orders , hoping for his veteran 's pension and a piece of land in a faraway province . The guard , the old woman , and her granddaughter had returned to the other side of the railing . Lacey stepped down from the platform , crossed the marble floor , and rejoined them . The guard was saying something intense and sorrowing to the old woman , pounding his chest emotionally as he did so . " Mio padre e morto , mia madre e morta " " Grazie , " Lacey said as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the guard said to him sharply . Lacey stopped . The guard finished his conversation with the old woman , took her hand and bowed over it , smiling , then conducted her and the girl to the doorway .  | When they were gone , the guard turned back to him and thrust out his hand . " Birra ! " he said imperiously . Lacey understood now why he had been invited along for the tour of the inner sanctum . The guard knew that the old Italian woman could n't afford a tip . But he was n't about to forgo his " beer money . " Lacey took out his wallet and gave the guard a one-thousand-lire note . " Grazie , " the guard said curtly . Outside , Lacey stood for a moment , blinking in the sunlight , briefly disoriented , briefly forgetful of what he was supposed to do next . Then he remembered . He glanced at his watch . It was a quarter to five . My God , had he been there that long ? Walking rapidly , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fori Imperiali , passed Caesar 's Forum and the Theater of Marcellus , and arrived at the last side street before the Tiber . Here he limped to a stopthe walk had aggravated his chronic callusand checked the time again . He still had five minutes . He looked up and down the street . It was a shabby , workingclass side street on the fringe of the Ghetto . The windows were shuttered ; there was no one in sight . He opened his briefcase and took out the newspapers . A copy of the International Herald Tribune was folded over a copy of the Rome Daily American . He had torn a hole in the center of the bottom newspaper . Now he took the slender metal tube from his inside jacket pocket and slipped it through this hole , adjusting it so that the tip of the tube stuck out of the folded newspapers by a fraction of an inch and the trigger mechanism jutted from the hole within . He closed the briefcase , switched it to his left hand , and tucked the newspapers under his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the newspapers , making sure he had easy access to the trigger . Then he walked on .  | Soon he passed the synagogue and came up to the Lungotevere , the broad roadway beside the Tiber . An unbroken flow of cars , four lanes of one-wav traffic , was rushing along it . Lacey looked around for a stoplight . There was n't any . He stepped out onto the street , then jumped back as he was almost cut down by a hissing Fiat . He walked along the curb , searching for some open crack in the traffic . He thought he saw one , darted out again , then found himself trapped between two lanes of cars . The vehicles swerved only the bare minimum necessary to miss him . He could feel the warmth of the heated steel as it grazed him . He stood there , his heart pounding , not daring to move , for about twenty seconds . Then he saw a tiny gap and dashed back to the curb . He glanced at his watch . One minute to five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just across the road . But how was he going to make it to the other side without getting killed himself ? A little farther down the street two nuns came up to the curb and stopped . They were about to cross the Lungotevere . Lacey hurried over to them and took a position on their right , the down-traffic side of them . The nuns stepped out onto the street . Lacey kept abreast of them . The nuns walked into the paths of the oncoming cars as serenely as if they were courting martyrdom . There was a screeching of tires as , one after the other , the cars came to an abrupt halt , sometimes less than a foot away from the rustling black habits . Without breaking step the two nuns , flanking Lacey , crossed to the river side of the Lungotevere . Lacey stopped while the nuns continued on over the Ouattro Capi bridge . The bridge led to a small island in the middle of the Tiber , the Isola Tiberina . The island was covered with old buildings . The largest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the bridge almost to the end of the island . It had the appearance of a monastery ,  | but there was a crisp , modernized look to it , as if it might have been converted to a hospital or a school . At the near end of the bridge , where it connected with the sidewalk , stone steps led down on either side to the river bank . Lacey walked over to the top of the steps on the right . The river bank was some forty feet below . Not far from the bottom of the steps , a lone woman stood at the water 's edge . Her back was turned to him and a scarf was wrapped around her hair . He could n't see her face , nor could he even tell whether she was young or middle-aged . She was slightly built and was wearing a blue blouse and a gray skirt . She was standing very still , gazing across the water at the Isola Tiberina . Lacey walked down the steps . He descended slowly , noiselessly , careful not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got to the bottom , he looked in both directions along the river bank . The only other figures in sight were two boys who were fishing much farther down by the neat bridge . A few yards away a trash fire was burning , but there was no one around to tend it . Most importantly , there was no other lone woman . This had to be the right one . He steadied the folded newspapers with his left hand . He slipped his right hand within the newspapers and adjusted the tilt of the metal tube . He rested his fingertip on the trigger . Ile took a deep breath , then slowly let it out . Get it over with , he told himself . Before she turns around . He glanced about him , looking for some small detail to focus upon to clear his mind . The old Roman embankment wall towered above him on his right . Green plants were growing from the cracks in it . What were they called ? He had seen them before somewhere . He could almost remember their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he advanced toward the woman . He gazed at the dark blue scarf which was rounded  | on her hair , separated it from the rest of her , fixed on it as a target . Capers . That was what they were . Wild capers . He came to a stop just three feet behind the woman . He raised the folded newspapers to a level with the blue scarf . " Hello , " he said . The woman turned quickly , then gasped in surprise . " Alan ! " It was Isabella . He froze . The newspapers remained suspended in the air midway between them . Over the paper 's edge , over the barely visible tip of the tube , he saw her face brightening with a smile of wonderment . " What are you doing here ? " she asked . The newspapers were suddenly leaden in his hands . He clutched them to his chest to keep from dropping them . " I I 've just been to the Forum , " he managed to say . " I came down here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " Isabella laughed , delighted by the coincidence . " And you saw me standing here ? " " Yes . Yes , I did . " His breath had stopped and there was a roaring in his head . Yet he heard a flat calmness in his voice as he asked , " How do you happen to be here ? " " I am waiting for a friend , " she replied . " But I am afraid that maybe lie has " She broke off uncertainly . " How do you say it ? Stood ? " " Stood you up ? " he murmured . " Stood me up , yes . He was supposed to be here at ten minutes to five . He is usually a very punctual man . " Isabella shrugged cheerfully . " Well , if he does not come , then we can have our dinner earlier . " His fingertip was still on the trigger . But the life had gone out of his hands . They were cold , without sensation . " I wo n't be able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has come up . She gazed at him perplexedly . " Are you all right , Alan ? You look so strange ! "  | Lacey backed away from her . " I have a problem , " he muttered . " What ? What is it , Alan ? Can I help ? " " I have a problem , " he repeated , more insistently . " A problem with my work . " She started to say something , but he did n't wait to hear it . He turned and rushed up the stone steps .  | Lacey walked aimlessly , following any street that would take him away from the Tiber . He crossed old neighborhoods , came upon hidden squares , was confronted unexpectedly by massive baroque churches as awesome as judgment Day . But he saw nothing . He felt numbed , unresponsive . He could think only of the mistake that had just happened . And surely it was a mistake . It did n't make sense otherwise . There was no conceivable reason why a good-natured Italian girl , a painter and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arabs . And yet the more he thought about it , the less sure he was . There had been no other lone woman waiting on that stretch of the Tiber river bank ; he was certain of it . The actual target might not have shown up . But then , could he accept the coincidence of Isabella , the girl he had met on the plane , arranging for a meeting with her friend at that very same spot ? Then again , if Isabella really was the target , their meeting on the plane was , in itself , a remarkable coincidence . But Lacey knew it was within the realm of possibility . Whenever possible , a target was liquidated in transit , when the target was exposed and vulnerable in some city distant from home . In  | such a case , it was not unusual for a disposal man and his target to arrive in the city within a day or so of each other . Of course the coordinator of the operation would n't be so dumb as to put them on the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had missed her plane the day before . So , by pure accident she had ended up on his flight . And what about her friend , the one she was supposed to meet by the Tiber ? This " very punctual " friend was quite late ; he may never have turned up at all . It was just as it would have been if Isabella had been lured to the spot by a phony message . This , as Lacey well knew , was a classic way to set up a target . But in the end , it did n't come down to the logical reasons . It was a matter of instinct . In that very first moment by the Quattro Capi bridge when Isabella had turned and confronted him , he had known she was the right person . And as lie had looked into her childlike , lovely face , bright with gladness at seeing him , something inside him had urged him to pull the trigger anyway , go ahead and do the job , do it well and completely , as he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he walked blindly on through the narrow Roman streets . He did n't dare stop . He was afraid that , if he did , the coil of nausea in the pit of his stomach might unwind , spread throughout him , overcome him . He followed still another turning , and suddenly he found himself in a very long seventeenth-century piazza . It was the Piazza Navona . It was moderately crowded ; people were strolling by and around the three ornate fountains , engaged in the early evening promenade . He walked midway into the piazza and sat down at one of the outside tables of the cafe that was opposite the large central fountain , Bernini 's Fountain of the Rivers . It was a splendid fountainfour river gods lounged on rocks at the base of a tall Egyptian obeliskbut it was n't looking its best at that moment . One of the river gods was covered with  | burlap . The statuary was evidently undergoing some restoration . A waiter came over to his table . Lacey ordered a cappuccino . He glanced around , taking in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so , as he tried to dispel the lingering sense of horror that clouded his brain . A trumpeter was standing by the northern fountain , playing " Besame Mucho . " In an open area in the center , some boys were fooling around with a soccer ball . They lofted it with their toes and bounced it off their heads . Across the way , on the top story of a building , a girl came out onto a balcony that was exploding with red geraniums . She leaned on the railing and looked down at the people on the piazza . The stately architecture of the balcony played tricks with her proportions ; it dwarfed her , so that at that distance he could n't tell whether she was a child or a woman . He remembered Isabella as he had first seen her at Heathrow Airport , the ambiguous child-woman she had seemed . Then he saw her face again , turning to him suddenly , the look of surprise , the delighted smile . She had been so happy to see him ! Why ? She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down at the table . The nausea had sprung loose . For a moment he thought he might be embarrassingly sick . The waiter returned and placed a cup of cappuccino before him . Lacey raised the cup to take a sip . The cup started shaking in his hand . He gripped it with both hands to keep the liquid from spilling . He managed to get the cappuccino to his lips and hold it steady long enough for one messy swallow . He put down the cup and wiped the steamed-milk foam from his mouth , glancing around uneasily to see if anyone was watching him . Two men were sitting at the next table . One of them , a  | short , sandy-haired man with pink-rimmed glasses , was gazing boredly out onto the piazza . But the other one , a taller , darkhaired man , was looking at Lacey with some interest . Lacey looked back at him , not to stare him down , but because the man seemed familiar and he was trying to place him . The man was rather formally dressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handkerchief in the breast pocket . He was an older man , nearing fifty perhaps ; but his handsome face was smooth and unlined and there was a lingering aura about him , an afterglow , of tarnished youth . " Hello , " the man said . " Hello , " Lacey said . " You look interesting . Why do n't you join us ? " His deep voice was softened by a vaguely Southern drawl . " I 'm really not interesting at all , " Lacey replied . " Let me decide that , " the man said , smiling . The sandy-haired man spoke up rather irritably . " Maybe he does n't want to be disturbed , Bill . " " Oh , yes , he does , " his companion said . " He 's in need of company . And we must n't turn away from a fellow American in need . " He looked at Lacey again and gestured to an unoccupied chair at his table . Lacey picked up his cup and briefcase and rose . He did n't particularly want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to accept the invitation . Rebuffing it would only attract more attention to him . He sat opposite the dark-haired man and studied his features for a moment . " We 've met before , have n't we ? " " Do you think so ? " the man murmured . " I 'm sure I 've seen you somewhere . " The man held out his hand . " I 'm William Hawk-wood . " " Oh , of course , " Lacey said . Hawk-wood was a well-known American writer . He shook his hand , then added , " I 've seen your picture in the magazines . " Hawkwood 's smile was polite and slightly pained . With a  | light gesture he introduced the sandy-haired man . " This is Richard , my friend and secretary . " Richard did n't offer his hand . " Good to meet you , " he said grudgingly . His eyes held on him , cold and magnified behind the lenses of his glasses . " And you are ? " Hawkwood prompted Lacey . " Alan . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comment on the omission of the last name . " Are you in Rome on business or for pleasure ? " " Business . " " What do you do ? " " I 'm a commercial traveler . " " And what 's your line ? " " Urinals , " Lacey said , giving his stock flip answer . Hawkwood regarded him gravely . " It 's not just urinals , Alan . " Lacey felt a little foolish now . " Hospital supplies , actually . " " It 's not just hospital supplies , either , " Hawkwood said gently . Lacey looked at him uneasily . Hawkwood 's gaze was calm , his faint smile sympathetic , almost understanding . But what could he understand ? Lacey glanced down at the briefcase beside his chair to make sure the lock was fastened . Then he realized that was a dumb , giveaway thing to have done . Hawkwood had followed the direction of his glance . " What else do you think I do ? " Lacey asked casually . " I do n't know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as you sat at that table . You seemed in bad shape . I somehow do n't think you would have been that shook up if you 'd blown an order of bedpans . " Lacey forced himself to laugh . " No , that 's true , " he admitted . " I 'm having some personal problems , " he said after a moment . " I just had a bad scene . With a girl I care about . " " Oh , really ? " There was something clinical in the way Hawkwood was  | studying him . Lacey had the feeling that the writer did n't see him as a distraught lover , either . Lacey changed the subject . " Are you staying in Rome now ? " he asked . " We live here . Richard and I have a villa on the Appian Way . " " The novels you write take place in America , do n't they ? " " Yes , usually . " " Then why have you decided to live in Rome ? On the Appian Way ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reflectively . " The Roman legions once marched down that road to civilize the world . It seemed as good a place as any to sit and watch the end of that world . " " You believe the world will end soon ? " " Imminently . " Lacey did n't know whether he should take these statements seriously or not . Hawkwood said everything in a wry , purring tone , as if he were ridiculing his own thoughts . But accepting this last notion at face value , Lacey commented , " The world looks pretty good from here , does n't it ? " With a gesture , he indicated the activity on the piazza . " Music ? Pretty girls ? Kids playing ? " " It 's very charming , " Hawkwood murmured . " Over there , " he said , pointing toward the large church across the piazza , " a thirteen-year-old girl who refused to marry the man her family had picked out for her was put into a brothel . When she would n't sleep with the customers , the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's terrible ! " Lacey said , aghast . " When did this hap-pen ? " " The fourth century A.D. The girl 's name was Agnes . She 's more generally known these days as Saint Agnes . " " Okay . But what 's your point ? " " You have to know the substructure . Beneath this beautiful piazza are the remains of the Circus of Domitian , one of the  | most evil of the emperors . Beneath that , I suppose , are potsherds from some farm of the early republic . But the substructure of it all is blood . And someday blood will reclaim it . " " That 's a morbid idea . " " Morbid ? It 's the curve of history . You spill blood . Then you consecrate it . Finally , you hire other people to spill blood for you . That is called civilization . ' " Lacey was uneasy again . He assumed the conversation had taken this turn at random , without intent . But with Hawkwood 's dark , intelligent eyes on him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to civilization ? " he asked . " On the contrary , " Hawkwood said , " I mourn it . Because all civilizations must end . And they end as they began . In spilled blood . Or in fire . It happened here before . It will happen again . The murderous barbarian is already among us . " Lacey looked down at his cup . " You seem fascinated by death , Mr. Hawkwood . " " I am very fascinated by it . " Lacey , looking up at him again , suddenly realized that Hawkwoocl 's hair was dyed and that the skin around his eyes had been smoothed by cosmetic surgery . He guessed that this man who was so fascinated by death was , in fact , quite afraid of it . " Have you ever killed a man ? " Lacey asked . " No , " Hawkwood replied . " I regret to say I have n't had that experience . I imagine it must be rather fulfilling . " " It is n't . It 's nothing . Believe me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lacey tensed . " I mean in wartime , " he said . " When I was a Marine . " " Of course , " Hawkwood said . Lacey eyed him warily and waited for him to continue . But Hawkwood seemed to have lost interest in the conversation , to have forgotten it completely . His focus of attention had shifted and he was looking past Lacey . A bemused , sensual smile had come onto his lips . " What a divine creature ! " he said softly .  | Lacey looked over his shoulder . Three androgynous young men were standing in front of the cafe , near the entrance to the table area . They were dressed very much alike , in tight pants and silk shirts that were open almost to the navel . Their eyes were artfully shadowed and their lips were crimsoned . One of the young men , the prettiest of the three , was looking at Hawkwood , trying not to , it seemed , glancing away , then back again , being caught in spite of himself by the writer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ height , very slim , with pale-skinned , delicate features and long blond hair that was gathered in a ponytail . He started to smile , then stopped himself . But the smile , while it lasted , showed that he was pleased by the older man 's admiring attention . " Who are they , Richard ? " Hawkwood asked . Richard 's expression had turned grim . Tight-lipped , he answered , " I think they 're from the French mime troupe . " " The transvestites ? " " Drag queens , " Richard said scornfully . He gave the ponytailed boy a jealous , killing look . " Let 's get the check , Bill . " " Not yet , " Hawkwood said , keeping his gaze fixed on the boy . " Ah , " he murmured with satisfaction , " here he comes . " The boy approached their table . His carriage was very erect and he walked on the balls of his feet . There was nothing coquettish or provocative in the way he moved . Rather , he seemed stylized and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stop directly in front of Hawkwood . " You seem to know who I am , " Hawkwood said to the boy . " Yes , I do , Monsieur Hawkwood . " The boy 's accent was nasally French , the " h " was unaspirated . " What 's your name ? " " Rene . " " Cut the Rene crap , " Hawkwood said pleasantly . " What 's your name ? " The boy was silent for a moment . Then he answered , " Ivor . " His accent was now flat , twangy American . " Where are you from , Ivor ? "  | " Seattle . " " Well , Ivor from Seattle , " Hawkwood said , smiling seductively , " I think you 're the most beautiful boy I have ever seen . " " Oh , for Christ 's sake , Bill , " Richard said with annoyance , " why do n't you put it to music ? " " Give me an hour and I will , " Hawkwood purred . Ivor glanced around at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the adulation as a usual thing . At the same time , he seemed to be without conceit . His beauty was the central fact of his life , and he coexisted with it timidly . " Pull up a chair , Ivor , " Hawkwood said . " Join us . " This seemed to Lacey as good a time as any to depart . " He can sit here , " he said , rising . " Are you leaving ? " Hawkwood asked , without much disappointment . " I hope we 'll see you again . " " I hope so , too . " Lacey looked around for the waiter . " Do n't worry about the cappuccino , " Hawkwood said . " Let me take it . " " Thanks . Well , so long . " Lacey turned to go . " Alan " Lacey turned back . Hawkwood had taken out a pen and was scribbling something on a slip of paper . " If you should need help , " he said , " please feel free to call on me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lacey took it and glanced at what was written on it : Hawkwood 's name , a phone number , and an Appia Antica address . " I do n't expect I 'll be here much longer , " he said . " But " he pocketed the slip of paper " you never know . " " You never know , " Hawkwood agreed .  | It was n't just the shock , he decided . And he knew himself too well to think he could be so physically overcome by a sense of horror . Lacey was sitting at a sidewalk table at the Cafe de Paris , trying to figure out what had happened to him the night before . When he had awakened , his thoughts had still been fogged . Now that he had gotten out into the daylight , he was beginning to see things more clearly . His choking up on the job was no mystery . He was only human , after all , and he had been hit by a tremendous surprise . What he needed to understand was his breakdown afterwards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands , were symptoms he could n't afford . He had practically gone to pieces in full view of dozens of people . No , it was n't the shock . He had been in the business too long to be deeply shocked by anything . It was the tension . It was the tension of a fine instrument that has been constructed to do just one thing and then becomes jammed at the moment of doing it .  | For the first time , he had not carried it through . And even now , sixteen hours later , as he sat over an espresso watching the flow of the people on the Via Veneto , he felt blocked , snarled , all tangled inside . The life of the Veneto eddied around him , heedless of his existence . The chic girls walked by briskly ; the young men lounged by at a more indolent pace , handbags slung over their shoulders . A tall , gaunt man was peddling lit-up yo-yos . A young Japanese was trying to work one of the yo-yos , and his Japanese companions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the table next to him a bored middle-aged gigolo was murmuring sweet broken-English nothings to a rich-widow type . No one was paying any attention to him . But Lacey felt self-conscious , suddenly vulnerable , as if he were sitting there naked and at any moment the people might turn and notice him , exposed as he was . What had Hawkwood read in him ? he wondered . There had been those seemingly pointed references . They could have been accidental , but , nevertheless , Hawkwood had seemed to have some instinct about him . Could he have detected something in his features ? Lacey had always assumed he looked pretty much like any other man . If his work had left a mark on him , it was nothing he could see when he looked at the plain , ordinary face in the mirror . But then , maybe there was something special about a disposal mansomething in the eyes , perhaps . Lacey really did n't know . He had met only one fellow professional in his whole career , a South African named Winslade who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried the mark of Cain on his brow . When he was still with the CIA , Lacey had teamed up with Winslade on a job in the south of France . They had had to wait for several days before the target could be set up , and in that time they had seen quite a lot of each other . Winslade was a cheerful , joke-telling sort whose one passion  | was automobiles . There was nothing sinister about him at all . And yet , when they had finally cornered the target on a lonely road by the sea , Winslade had fired the first shot , and had fired it into the man 's stomach . A stomach shot was n't an instantly killing shot ; it was waste action and a bit risky , and afterwards Lacey had asked him about it . " I like to let a man have one in the gut first , " Winslade had said breezily . " Otherwise , the bloke wo n't know what 's happening to him . " So , all right , Winslade was cruel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streak of sadism in them , too . But he did n't think of himself as being particularly cruel . He took no pleasure in killing ; there was never any emotional feedback from it . Then why had he gone into the work ? And why did he do it so well ? Navona 1000 . He saw the sign at the end of the alley , saw it in his mind as he had so often seen it in his dreams , the word and number spelled out in lit neon , and , in the foreground of the image , the man with the dyed black hair running toward him , his face a ghostly white , his mouth open as if in a soundless scream of terror . Navona 1000 . A particular place at a particular time . He was the one who happened to be there . It could have been anyone ; but it was he , caught in that moment . And in that moment something emerged from the deepest recess in him , made itself known , defined him . He did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was much like anyone else , a man who loved his family , no less decent than these people around himthe waiter , the yo-yo peddler , the gigolo . The only difference was that none of them had been there , at that place in that moment of time . They had never been put to the test . There had been no Navona 1000 in any of their lives . And the dark , innate talent , the gift of the kill , was safely locked within them . Well , whatever the reason , he was what he was , an expert  | technician who could do only one small thing , but who did it as well as anyone in the world . Until lately . Something was happening . He was losing his cool , his efficiency ; his timing was off . And , finally , he had broken down completely . Now , as he sat there , a failed mechanism , he wondered if he could no longer do it , what would he be ? Nobody . Just another man without a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rose and started down the Via Veneto toward his hotel . When he arrived in front of the Imperiale , he stopped . If he went in , it would only mean grappling with his thoughts within the confines of his little turret room . He looked across the street at the Church of the CaMonks . There was a famous cemetery beneath it , he remembered , a crypt that contained the bones of four thousand monks . He had never seen it . Now was as good a time as any . He crossed the Via Veneto and went into the church through the street-level doorway . Inside , he went down some stairs to a subterranean level . He found himself at the entrance to a large underground chamber . A gray-bearded Capuchin monk stood nearby , regarding him through owlish horn-rimmed glasses . But there was no one else around . It was still too early in the morning for tourists . Lacey entered the crypt , then stopped , taken aback by what he saw . The place was busy with human bones , bones everywhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foot of wall and ceiling was covered with a decorative filigree of tibias and fibulas , thigh bones and hip bones . He walked down the passageway . On his left , side by side , were five chapels . In each of them , skeletons in cowled robes were standing , in floral arbors of bones or lying on beds of bones . They all had crosses clutched in their brittle hands . The skulls of the standing skeletons were bent reverently . The  | prone skeletons , for some reason , looked less at peace , rather uncomfortable , in fact . He went to the end . Skulls grinned down at him from the ceiling arches . Pelvic bones flared out from the skulls in a winged effect . In the last chapel , he found one contemporary touch : on the top skull of a near-at-hand pile of skulls , on a spacious cranium that may once have contained the brain of a seventeenth-century prior , some amorous Italian had printed in ink : " Dario e Antonella . " Lacey smiled to himself and returned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better . This skeleton freak show had a calming effect on him . It gave him some perspective . The monks had doubtless intended this grisly display as an awesome memento mori , but in reality it reduced the whole thing to a joke . If this was all we came to , cartoon stick figures of dried-up calcium posed in a hokev tableau , then death was nothing that could be taken seriously . Isabella was dead . The order had been given . Soon enough , she would be simplified to one of these comical fossils . And he , in his turn , would be too . It meant nothing . She was dead . No matter what , the order would be carried out , if not by him , then by someone else . There was nothing he could do about it . The most he could do was to make it gentle , make it painless for her . In the chapel before him , the skeleton up front , at the right-hand corner , was turned back toward the others . He seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , their skulls downturned , were impervious . What was he shouting about ? he wondered . Judgment Day ? It would be a long , cold wait . There was only life , for the brief time it lasted . And life was a matter of doing your work . Meeting your obligations . There could be no exceptions .  | When he emerged from the crypt , the gray-bearded monk was still there . The monk pointed to a wire receptacle that was attached to the wall , with a few silver coins in it . Lacey dropped a five-thousand-lire note into the receptacle . " Grazie , " he said to the monk . He went to the stairs and climbed back up into the day . Isabella 's gaze had wandered to the men who were sitting at the next table , the large central table in Romolo 's garden . There were five of them , short-haired Americans in neatly pressed summer slacks , and they were talking rapidly and intensely . An awning had been drawn over them to protect them from the sun . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I love watching Americans . " " I would have thought you 'd had your fill of them , " Lacey said . " You had eight million to watch in New York . " " I like watching them hereor any place that is not America . They " she cocked her head and regarded them with a painter 's eye " occupy spaceyou know ? They fill up space in a way no other people do . " She listened for a moment . " What are they saying ? " Lacey concentrated on the nearby conversation . One of the men was holding forth solo now , in a lecturer 's authoritative voice , while his untouched pasta cooled before him . " Of course , the isotopic composition is very different throughout the galaxy . But in certain areas in the center of the galaxy the isotopic composition is remarkably like our own . " " They 're talking about the stars , " Lacey said . " Must be an astronomers ' convention in town . " Isabella smiled wryly , as if an odd thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would think ? " " Who 's that ? " he asked . " She was Raphael 's mistress . This was her house . " He looked around at the garden , then at the rear of the  | reddish , discolored building , seeing it now , not as a restaurant , but as a Renaissance house . The leafy vine arbor that spread over the garden could well have been the cultivation of centuries . The walls of the garden were even more lush with vines , and above them loomed Trastevere buildings which seemed no less weatherbeaten and ancient than this one . " Could she ever have dreamed , " Isabella said , " that someday big , blond men would sit in her garden , discussing the faraway stars ? " " Maybe they talked about them then , too . " " One or two people did . But unfortunately they were burned at the stake . " The waiter arrived with their main courses , a fish dish for Isabella , a veal dish for Lacey . Isabella picked at her food absently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She had been strangely uncommunicative , both on the phone and when he had come by to pick her up . She was friendly enough , but she was far from being the spontaneous , talkative girl she had seemed on the plane . Still , she had readily accepted his invitation to lunch . And when he had arrived at the apartment on the Via delle Muratte , she had introduced him warmly to her friends Antonio and Giulia Rinaldi . But then she had fallen silent , and it was the Rinaldis who had carried on the conversation . Or , rather , Antonio had , since his wife spoke little English . Antonio was an intense man of about Lacey 's age . His English was excellent , and he was given to making dramatic statements . " Isabella should stay in America , " he declared . " There is nothing for her in this country . Italy is doomed . " " There are those who say the United States is doomed , too , " Lacey commented . " Communist nonsense ! " Antonio scoffed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can happen to a man than to be born in America . You have such opportunities ! Anything is possible ! " " Nothing is possible in Italy ? " " Without oil ? Without minerals ? With a people who have no concept of what it is to work ? " " The people here seem energetic enough , " Lacey said . " Energetic ? Maybe . Energetic in useless pursuits . The truth , my friend , is that a Roman has nothing more in his head than the thought of wrapping himself around a big plate of pasta . " There was scorn and anguish on Antonio 's thin , brooding face . " Once the Romans were a great people , " he said . " But today the Roman is a servant . He exists only to serve other people 's pleasures . In this housedo you know ? except for Giulia and myself , everyone is either a whore or a waiter . And that is what Rome has become , " he concluded with bitter emphasis , " a city of whores and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then said it was time for them to go . They had left the Rinaldis ' apartment and had taken a taxi across the Tiber to Trastevere . Now , as they sat in the restaurant garden with the silence between them stretching on , Lacey , recalling the conversation , said , " Antonio is a very interesting man . " Isabella looked up quickly from her plate of whitefish , as if she had been startled out of a reverie . " Very interesting , " he repeated . He did n't really want to talk about Antonio . But he had grown fearful of the silence . Conversation was safer . He could hide behind it , distract her with it , prevent her from sensing his thoughts . " How did you happen to become friends ? " he asked . " Antonio has known me since I was born , " Isabella said . " He is from Lucca , too . When I went to art school here , he looked after me . He was like a second father . " " What kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works for the American Embassy . In the scientific department . " Lacey was instantly wary . The scientific departments of embassies were heavily involved in intelligence . It could mean nothing , but , still , he had to proceed with care . " He was very kind to me once , " Isabella went on , " in an unhappy time . " " When you were going to art school ? " " Yes . I fell in love with a man . " She laughed softly , a bit sheepishly , as she remembered it . " Sometimes I would sit up with Antonio all nighttalking to him about itcrying in his arms . " " What was the problem ? Did n't the man love you ? " " Oh , yes , he loved me . " She shrugged . " But he was married . " " That 's not such a big obstacle anymore , is it ? Have n't the divorce laws been changed ? " " The laws , yes . But the attitudes do not change so easily . Danilo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very bourgeois man . And perhaps , " she added , with a slight , rueful smile , " he was not so terribly unhappy with his home life . " " What finally happened ? " " I went to New York . It was Antonio 's idea . He thought it would be good for me . A change of scene , you know ? " " And in New York you were able to forget this man ? " " Not completely . But , yes , " she admitted , after a moment , " I thought of him less as time went on . In New York , there were other problems . " " Other men ? " The expression faded from Isabella 's face . She regarded him blankly for a moment , then looked down at her plate . With a twinge of embarrassment he realized he had been insensitive . " Sorry . I did n't mean to pry . " " There is no need to apologize , " she said rather distantly . She had turned inward again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " are you mad at me ? " She looked up at him , surprised . " Why would I be mad at you ? " " I do n't know , " he said . " But you 've been acting funny . You keep turning off on me . Have I offended you ? Or are you annoyed because I ran off last night ? " " Please , " Isabella said , " let us forget about that . I told you , I understood . You were upset over your work . Americans always get too upset over their work . " " Then what have I done ? " " It has nothing to do with you , Alan , " she insisted . " Believe me . " " Okay , if you say so . " " I am disturbed , yes . But it is because of something else . " " And you ca n't tell me what it is ? " She shrugged wearily . " All right , " she said , " I will tell you . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said I was waiting for a friend ? " " Yeah . " " I saw him . " A glimmer of hope brightened in him . Could her appointment by the Tiber have been legitimate ? " He came , after all ? " " No , not then . " She looked perplexed . " It is strange . Someone played a trick on me . I do n't understand why . " His momentary hope evaporated . He still had the right person . " What kind of trick ? " he asked . " Someone left a note at the Rinaldis . A note from my friendit seemed to be his handwritingexcept now he tells me he knows nothing about this note . " Isabella shook her head , then laughed : a swift , puzzled laugh . " This note said I was to meet him by the guattro Capi bridge . And that I should not call him before then because he was too busy . " " And what did you do when he did n't turn up ? " " I phoned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later . "  | Her eyes went blank again and her mouth tightened . " And I did what I came to Rome to do . I told this man I could never see him again . " " He 's your lover ? " " He was my lover . " She smiled wanly . " So , you see , I am a little depressed . It is not easy to tell a man , a man who says he loves you , that it is all over . " " Well , it may not be that final . You might have second thoughts . " " No , it is final , " she said quietly . " I will have no second thoughts . " " One thing I do n't understand , " Lacey said after a moment . " Have n't you been in New York for the last couple of years ? " " The affairmy affair with this manhas been in New York . But he is in Rome now for a conferencehe is a diplomat . It was time for me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped off in Rome and " With a light gesture she concluded , " e finito . " Telling her story seemed to have lifted her spirits somewhat , and she was smiling now . " Enough of this , " she said . " It is over . And we will no longer talk about it . Instead , we will have a good time . " She had transformed by an act of will , perhaps ; it was too swift to be spontaneous into the childlike , insouciant girl he had met on the plane . Her tone was playful as she said , " Let us have a very romantic afternoon . " " All right . Fine by me . If you 're ready . " " Of course I am ready ! Anyway , I am " She hesitated . " How do you say it ? Like a ball that bounces ? On the bounce ? " " On the rebound ? " " On the rebound , yes . So make the most of it , Alan Lacey . Because I find you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He forgot his purpose long enough to be pleased by the compliment . " But I 'm afraid you wo n't find me as glamorous asthis painter or this diplomat . "  | " You have your virtues , " Isabella said . " I think you are probably nicer than either Danilo or Mohammed . " " Mohammed ? " " Yes . The diplomat . He is an Arab . " Lacey was suddenly alert . He was mindful of his business now , hyperaware of the situation . He was aware of the metal tube in his inside jacket pocket . He was aware of the degree of vulnerability of the target as she leaned forward on the table , and he was aware of all the factors that ruled out this garden as the place for the liquidation . He was aware , also , that someone had just stepped out from the rear doorway of the building , stared at him briefly , then disappeared . When he looked up , he saw no one . A white-jacketed waiter carrying a tray came out through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person who corresponded to the dark blur that had been recorded at the very periphery of his vision . It could have been anyone , he thought ; a customer who had popped into the garden for a moment . And the person might not really have looked at him . He could n't be sure ; it was only a faint impression . But he was unable to recover his sense of ease . He felt uncomfortable now , sitting in the dappled sunlight of the garden . " Maybe we should skip dessert and coffee , " he said . " Let 's get out of here and go somewhere else . " Isabella seemed a bit taken aback by his abruptness . " Where do you want to go ? " " Wherever you suggest . You know this city . And you 're the authority on romance . " She thought for a moment . " All right , " she said brightly . " Let us go to the Borghese Gardens . " They stood at the balustrade of the Pincio , at the west end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ahead of them , on the far side of the Tiber , the great dome of St.  | Peter 's dominated the cityscape . To the south , less pleasingly , the Vittorio Emanuele monument with its turn-of-the-century excessiveness loomed over the old districts around it . Beneath then , in the Piazza del Popolo , at the top of the Corso , some black-jacketed motorcyclists gunned their engines discontentedly , as if they were troubled by an impossible longing to race their machines down the traffic-congested artery . He looked away from the view to study Isabella . The afternoon sunlight brought out hues in her eyes he had n't noticed before ; yellows and gray-greens glinted in the blue irises . The breeze was tossing a strand of dark hair back and forth on her forehead . She smiled slightly , aware of his scrutiny , but unwilling as yet to acknowledge it by looking at him . " Why have you never married ? " she asked . Lacey paused before answering . He had not said he was unmarried in so many words . But he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he had omitted any mention of Sharon or the children . " What makes you think I 've never been married ? " " You have not mentioned it , " she said . " No , but that does n't prove anything . I could have all kinds of ex-wives . " Isabella smiled . " Are you like Bluebeard , with a woman locked up in every room of your castle ? " " Could be , " he said . She shook her head . " You are not Bluebeard . You are a nice man who has not found the right person yet . " Lacey looked at the view again . " Maybe I 'm too selfish , " he said . She put her hand gently on his arm . " You must not be so hard on yourself , Alan . " She paused , as if waiting for him to say something . But he kept silent . " Let us walk through the park , " Isabella said . Lacey turned and looked at the groves that extended beyond the flowered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | hoped , against all likelihood , that Isabella might change her mind , decide against the walk . Because he knew that somewhere along the wooded paths , he would find an opportunity . He would have a chance to do his work . " Are n't you tired ? " he asked . " No , " she replied . " Conte on , " she urged , lightly tugging at his arm . They walked along the path on the south side of the Pincio . At the far end of the gardens , they passed a small merry-goround . Little children were revolving about in a car , a jeep , a U.S. tank , a motorcycle , a fire truck , and a military truck bearing a missile . They entered the wooded area and walked on past ilex trees and umbrella pines . After a few moments Lacey began to relax . IIe saw that all the paths were well-populated : young lovers hand-in-hand , older married couples accompanied by children , and a few lone , dreamy souls , ambling in the bosky shade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He tensed as her knuckles brushed the fabric of his jacket over the metal tube . But only for a moment . Then he gave in to the easy , sensual rhythm of the arm-in-arm stroll . Her hip was grazing his thigh as they walked . It was caressing , a soothing touch . He found himself suspended in the experience , aware of nothing beyond it , enjoying it . He enjoyed the warm languorousness of the afternoon . He enjoyed the tantalizing presence of the beautiful young woman beside him . He enjoyed the musky fragrance of her perfume . He could n't remember the last time he had walked with a girl in a park . With Sharon , of course . But not with a girl who was new and mysterious , with all things about her yet to be discovered . Not in a long time . He had forgotten how pleasant it could be . " I used to paint here , " Isabella said . " What would you paint ? Trees ? " " Sometimes trees . "  | " Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down splotches of color . " " I am interested in living things , " she said . " I paint natural forms . Sometimes people . " " Have you ever had a show of your paintings ? " " Not a one-woman show . Not yet . But in New York I had some of my work in a group show . " " What kind of group show ? " She smiled . " I am almost afraid to tell you . " " Why ? " " It was a women 's collective , " she said . " You mean , Women 's Lib ? " " Feminists , yes . " She glanced at him quickly , taking in his reaction . " Some men , if you say that , they yell and scream . " " It does n't bother me , " he said . " There 's something to it , I guess . So you 're a feminist ? " " In a way . " She thought for a moment . " Not truly . " They had come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one ahead of them . He looked over his shoulder and saw that no one was behind them , either . His left arm remained curled easily around hers . But his right arm tensed ; his right hand flexed , readying itself . No , he told himself , not yet . There would be an opportunity later on . Maybe in another five minutes . In the meantime , he might as well learn more about her while he had the chance . " Here , " Isabella said , " I am a feminist . I am thought of as a wild woman . " She laughed . " It is not hard to be thought of as a wild woman in Italy . To people who think of a woman as a domestic animalbed and kitchen and nothing elseI am a very bad person . I am bad because I choose to be free . But , " she went on , " I am not like some of the women I met in New York . For instance " she looked at him out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not hate men . " The path turned and ended . They came out into a large  | opening that surrounded a lake . It was fairly crowded , and even though it was a weekday , there was a holiday spirit in the air . People lounged by the water , or walked along the grassy banks , or glided on the surface of the lake in small rowboats . Professional boatmen steered larger , canopied boats , with noisy children bouncing on them . Fat brown and white ducks were mooching crusts of bread from the generoushearted . Isabella stopped suddenly . " All ! " It was a little gasp of excitement . " I burattini ! " " What ? " " Puppets ! " She pointed . " See ? " A small crowd had gathered near a tall umbrella pine . A miniature stage had been set up by the trunk of a tree , and on it two puppets were jerking about . " Come on ! " She took his hand and , with childlike eagerness , dragged him after her . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One puppet , a grotesque little fellow wearing a black mask , a peaked white hat , and what seemed to be a white nightgown , was singing off-key in a loud , squeaky voice . The other one , a handsome , mustachioed puppet in a guardsman 's jacket , was yelling at him , cursing him , it seemed . Isabella was already laughing . " What 's going on ? " Lacey asked . " This one does not like the way that one sings , and he is " She broke off and with a helpless wave of her hand said , " It does not translate . " White Hat had stopped singing , and now the two puppets were yelling at each other at the same time . Mustache disappeared beneath the stage , then popped up again , carrying a stick . He beat White Hat with it . White Hat got very agitated , snatched away the stick , and beat Mustache in return . It did n't seem very funny to Lacey , but he chuckled any-  | way . Isabella took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleased that he saw the humor of it , too . He looked down at her . She was no longer watching the puppets but was gazing up at him , smiling . He bent his head to kiss her . It was an impulse ; he did n't pause to question it . But as his lips were about to make contact with hers , he stopped . Out of the corner of his eye , he had caught sight of a figure that had emerged from behind the trunk of the umbrella pine , had stepped clear of the puppet stage , and was now standing , facing them . He straightened up and looked , rather casually , not so obviously that Isabella would notice . It was Renato , Aziz 's helper . The young man was standing , his hands on his hips , staring at them with blatant interest . " Let 's go , " Lacey said . " Now ? " Isabella looked totally baffled . " I just remembered , I 've got some work to do . " He took her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't look back at Renato . They said very little on the way back through the park or in the taxi . No cars were allowed in the Trevi Fountain neighborhood , so the driver let them out on the Via del Tritone , two blocks from the Rinaldis ' apartment . They walked from there down the middle of the traffic-free street . Isabella was obviously distressed . She imagined she had done something wrong , and of course she could n't guess what it was . From time to time , she would cast a nervous , sidelong glance at him . But Lacey kept his eyes before him and said nothing . They turned into the Via delle Muratte . He went with her as far as the door of the Rinaldis ' building , then he took her hand and said , " It 's been a beautiful afternoon , Isabella . Thank you . " " I enjoyed it too , Alan . " She hesitated , still uncompre-  | bending , then asked , " But what happened ? What is the matter ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He walked away . When he turned the corner at the end of the block , they were there waiting for him , Renato and another man , a tall , husky Arab in a black sweater and black pants . " Buon giorno , Signor Martin , " Renato said pleasantly . " I hope you boys are n't too tired from following me around , " Lacey said . Renato smiled and shrugged . " It isnice day . " He knew a few words of English , after all . Lacey walked with them back to the Via del Tritone . They led him to a small gray Fiat parked near the intersection . Renato gestured for him to get in the front . Lacey did so . The Arab got in behind the wheel . Renato sat in the back , directly behind Lacey . The Arab started the engine and the car pulled away .  | " Mr. Lacey , I am shocked , " Aziz said . " I can not express to you how shocked I am ! I was told you were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I am , " Lacey said . " Then how do you explain your behavior ? " The two of them were alone in the office , but Aziz kept his voice soft : sibilant with outrage , but prudently hushed . " You were supposed to accomplish your task at five o'clock yesterday . Everything was prepared for you . But , for some reason , you did not do it . Instead , my men tell me , you have been fraternizing with the target : dining with her , walking in the Borghese Gardens with her . Did you come to Rome on holiday , Mr. Lacey , or to do your work ? " " To do my work . But a crazy thing happened . " As he looked at the little caftan merchant , Lacey felt a weary sense of futility . He would explain , but he doubted that this suspicious , crafty Arab would believe him . " I met this girl on the plane . I sat with her . I did n't know until the very last  | moment that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too surprisedI could n't do it . " " Because you hadby chancealready met her ? " " Yes. , , " That was unfortunate , " Aziz said . " But why should it make any difference ? Must a target always be a stranger to you ? " " It helps , " Lacey said . Aziz looked at him probingly for a moment . " Does this mean that now you do not intend to do the job ? " " I did n't say that , " Lacey replied quickly . " Of course I 'm going to do it . But I 'll have to wait for another chance . " " Was there no chance in the Borghese Gardens ? It seems a logical place for a person to have a heart attack . " " It was a public place and I would have been detained as a witness . It would have meant getting involved with the police . The medical examiners . " " But you would have seemed perfectly innocent . " " I am an employee of Imperial Medical Supplies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any suspicion at all , it would lead back to Mr. Chubb . Mr. Chubb would not like that . " Aziz looked unhappy at the mention of Chubb . " There would be no problem , of course , if you had performed your task at the proper time . " " I realize that . " " We did our part . You will explain that to Mr. Chubb ? We prepared this operation with great care , and with no mistakes . " " You were terrific , " Lacey said . " I 'll tell him that . " This seemed to make Aziz feel a little better . He sat back in his chair and , in a more relaxed fashion , asked , " Now , when do you plan to finish this job ? " " By tomorrow night , I hope . What I have to do is to get this girl alone somewhere . " Aziz thought for a moment , then he nodded . " By tomorrow  | night . Until then , I will continue to have faith in your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was concerned , their meeting was over . But Lacey remained seated . There was a question he wanted to ask . He could n't leave until he had an answer . " Is there something else ? " Aziz asked . " Yes . " He waited until Aziz was sitting behind his desk again . " Why does this girl have to die ? " Aziz looked genuinely shocked . " You know you are not supposed to ask that ! " It was a grave breach of professional etiquette , as Lacey well knew . A disposal man was never supposed to ask the reason . But he persisted . " This case is different . I 've gotten to know the girl . " " That should affect nothing . " " It affects me , " Lacey said with sudden intensity . " Because I 'm the one who has to do the job . And I ca n't do it properly if I do n't know the reason . Why is it so important to you that this girl be dead ? " Aziz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will not do it unless you know ? " " No , not exactly . " He was on treacherous ground now , and he chose his words carefully . " But it would make the job easier for me if I knew . " Aziz was silent for a moment . " If you insist , I will tell you , " he said at length . " She is an Israeli spy . " " That 's ridiculous ! " " Why do you think so ? " " Well , she 's been living in New York , teaching art . What kind of spying could she be doing ? Who could she have contact with ? " " Signorina Fratti has been having an affair with a highranking diplomat of the Arab world . She has obtained important information from himinformation that she has passed on to Israeli intelligence . "  | Lacey was stunned . He wanted to laugh at the absurdity of it . But he did n't , because he began to understand . Someone else might have found it hard to believe that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ role , be a spy . But he knew that it was the romantics who most readily got involved in espionage . " Why has n't the man been warned ? " Lacey asked . " He has been warned . But he will not listen . He is stupidly infatuated with this woman . " " Then he should be removed from his position . " " That can not be done , either . He is the cousin of a king . " Aziz shrugged and smiled resignedly . " So , you see , the simplest solutionthe only one , perhaps , is this one . " It took him a second to get his thoughts straight , and then the realization hit him . Aziz was talking about a situation that no longer existed . " Wait a minute , " Lacey said . " It is n't necessary anymore . " " Why is that ? " " Because Isabella has broken up with this man . That 's why she 's here . " He spoke rapidly now , eagerly . He was already feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him she was n't going to see him again . She told him that last night . " Aziz looked at him curiously . " Are you Signorina Fratti 's confidante ? " " No , of course not . But it was on her mind . And she talked about it . So you can tell your superiors that the problem no longer exists . The affair is over . It 's finished . " Aziz was smiling patiently . " Mr. Lacey , do you really expect us to call off this operation because of a young woman 's whim ? " " It 's not a whim . She 's serious , " Lacey insisted ; " she means it . " " And she will mean it when she goes back to the man tomorrow , or next month . Or when the Israelis persuade her ro  | go back to him . No , Mr. Lacey , " he said quietly , " the orders still stand . " Lacey stared at him , and suddenly he knew it was no use . In Aziz , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operative . To such a man , a carefully planned operation was everything . Nothing must disturb it . Nothing must mar the beauty of it . " Why do n't you wait ? " Lacey asked . " Why do n't you wait until she does go back to him ? " " We will not wait . And you will do the job you were sent here to do . By tomorrow night , Mr. Lacey , " he said pointedly . " By tomorrow night . " He sat by the phone , waiting for it to ring . It did . He picked up the receiver . " Signor Lacey , " the man on the switchboard said , " I have your party . Go ahead , please . " Sharon 's voice came on the line . " Hello , Alan ? " " Hello , sweetheart . How are you ? " " Are you all right ? I 've been so worried ! " " Sure I 'm all right . Why were you worried ? " " Because you did n't call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today or not . I almost went to the station and waited , anyway . " " I 'm sorry , honey . I got so caught up in things hereI just did n't have a chance to call . " " When are you coming back ? " " I do n't know , " he said wearily . " Day after tomorrow , I hope . " " Oh . " She did n't conceal her disappointment . " Not until then ? " " Does n't look like it . I might even be here longer . Ca n't be helped . There 's been a foul-up . " " What kind of foul-up ? "  | " There 's no point in going into it . It 's boring . It 's business . Is everything all right at home ? " " Yes . Mr. Studworth is coming by tomorrow to fix the water heater . " " Good . " " And there 's a letter from your mother . " " Does it look like anything special ? " " It just seems like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kids ? " he asked . " They 're fine . " There was a touch of hesitancy to her answer . More anxiously he asked , " Are they all right ? " " Yes , they 're both all right . " Once again there was an uncertain note in her voice . " What is it , Sharon ? Is it Jimmy ? " " Nell " she began . Then , with desperate brightness , she insisted , " He 's fine . They 're both fine . " He heard her voice catch . And he sensed that she was trying to keep from crying . " What 's wrong , sweetheart ? " he asked gently . " Please tell me . " I was n't going to tell you until you got back . I did n't want to worry you . " " I 'll be more worried now if you do n't tell me . " There was silence on the line for a moment . Then she said , " You remember , last week I took Jimmy to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now , do n't get upset , Alan , " she said quickly , " the doctor says it is n't serious , but " She hesitated again , then said it . " Jimmy has a spot on his lung . " " TB ? " " He does n't know . It could be that . It could be something else . And maybe it 's nothing serious at all . " She was trying to maintain a bright , chatty tone , as if this were nothing more than light telephone gossip . " He wo n't know until he 's taken more X rays . Done more tests . "  | " So we 'll just have to wait ? " " Yes . The doctor did say one thing . It fits in with what we were talking about just before you left . " " What ? " " He said Jimmy should be in a drier climate . " She laughed , a soft , strained laugh . " So maybe it 's good that we 're thinking of going home soon . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's the best idea I 've had in a long time . " Neither of them said anything for a moment . " I miss you , Alan . " " I miss you too , sweetheart . " " You will come home soon ? " " As soon as I can . I wish I were there with you right now . " " We should n't talk too long , " she said . " This must be costing a fortune . " " Okay . I 'll call you again when I definitely know the time I 'm coming back . " " I love you . " " Love you , too . " The familiar melody swept over him , the melody he had heard a hundred times before without knowing what it was . Now he could locate its source as four costumed singers on the stage of the Rome opera , a hunchback , his daughter , a duke , and an assassin 's sister . He concentrated on the music , still seeking an anesthetic ease . The hope of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portiere had suggested a visit to the Rome opera , and Lacey had seized upon the idea . Ile had seen only one or two operas in his life . But any distraction was better than none . It was n't working , though . His mind kept returning to his conversation with Sharon , and to that mysterious , frightening spot on Jimmy 's lung . He told himself he should n't be too  | worried . Doctors were always trying to scare you . Spots showed up on chest X rays all the time . As often as not , it was a false alarm . Still , he could n't stop thinking about it . Nor would his thoughts let go of his other problem , his professional problem . The quartet was over . There were now three people on the stage , the assassin , his sister , and the hunchback 's daughter . They were singing a fast , intense trio while the orchestra made windstorm sounds . Lacey had studied the synopsis in his program , trying to comprehend the story of the opera @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hired by a hunchback named Rigoletto to liquidate the hunchback 's boss , the local duke . The problem now , as best he could gather , was that Sparafucile 's sister had taken a liking to the duke and did n't want her brother to go through with the liquidation . Lacey watched Sparafucile with some interest . The fat singer was n't too convincinghe waved his dagger about as though it were a lilybut the character was the only one on the stage whom Lacey understood . He was just a guy trying to do his job . He had a small business , a tavern which , judging by the look of the set , was n't doing too well . He had a sister to look after . He had his pride in his work , his professional honor ; he had accepted an assignment and he wanted to deliver . It was a different century , but the problems were pretty much the same . And the hatred was the same , the same then as now , the same always . There was always some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There were always hunchbacks who hated handsome dukes , Greeks who hated Turks , Arabs who hated Jews . Until finally , in the end , they called upon men like Sparafucile , like Lacey , men who hated no one but who had their one small skill and responsibilities to meet . Afterwards , as he walked toward his hotel , he thought back on the resolution of the opera , remembered it with amusement and a certain wistfulness . Sparafucile solved his problem  | by agreeing to substitute someone else for his assigned target the next person who entered the tavern . This happened to be Rigoletto 's daughter , and it was her body in a sack that Sparafucile delivered to the hunchback . A cute notion , but he could imagine how far he would get if he tried to pull such a stunt on Aziz . There was a difference between opera and life . Nevertheless , as he crossed the Piazza Barberini , he was reminded of the atmosphere of the opera , the nighttime ominousness of it . The fountain was unlit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; because of the energy crisis , the lights were out all over Rome . It no longer seemed the festive town he remembered . It had reverted to something medieval , sinister , joyless . On the other side of the piazza , at the foot of the Via Veneto , a figure emerged from the shadows and stood in his way . It was a woman in a cloth coat . " Vuole far amore ? " she asked him . " What ? " " You want to make love ? " She was plump , bespectacled , homely , and middle-aged . Unsmiling , she pressed close to him . Her pimp was standing nearby , his handbag slung over his shoulder , turned away but listening . " No , thanks , " Lacey said , and started to walk past her . She gripped his lapel with two fingers , stopping him . " I am very good lover , " she said . " French love . You like it . Twenty thousand lire . " He looked down at her hand . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said sharply . She withdrew her hand and he walked on . What was he doing there ? he wondered dazedly . His little boy was sick , and he was going to the opera in Rome . His little boy might die if he was n't brought home to the dry , warm , safe air of southern California , and he was wandering along the Via Veneto , being hustled by diseased old whores .  | And why ? Because he had made the grave error of letting a target become a human being . The portiere gave him a slip of paper along with his room key . " Someone called , " he said . Lacey stared at the name on the slip of paper . " Signorina Fratti . " All right , then . It was time to get on with it . His family needed him .  | The middle-aged Italian couple at the next table got up and went out . Isabella and he were left alone in the little rear room of the Gaffe Greco . Now was the time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had had in a day of sightseeing . And this plush coffeehouse , with its marbletop tables and oil paintings of ancient Greek pastoral scenes , seemed as good a place as any to make his pitch . He had prepared himself as best he could . He had gone over various sentences in his head . The clever ones , the original ones , he ruled out . He knew he did n't have the personality for them . The standard lines he remembered from the movies seemed the bestor the safest , at any rate . " I think I 'm falling in love with you , " he said . Isabella looked a bit startled . She smiled quickly . And then , as quickly , her smile faded . " Does that embarrass you ? " he asked . " No , not at all , " she said . " I am flattered . But " she laughed wonderingly " you have known me so short a time . " " How long do you have to know someone to know you care  | for herwant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inarticulate , genuinely so . He had never said anything like this before , and the words were cumbersome on his tongue . " I 'm just telling you this , " he murmured with an uncomfortable shrug . " I do n't expect you to feel anything for me . " " But I do , Alan , " she said warmly . She leaned forward and put her hand on his . " I like you very much . " " These have been the two happiest days of my life , " he said . " I only wish I did n't have to go back tomorrow . " " Tomorrow ? " There was real distress in her reaction . " I talked with my boss on the phone . He wants me back in London tomorrow afternoon . A big meeting . " " We will see each other again , " she said . " I hope so . " He paused . He was coming to the difficult part now , and be had to be careful about the words he chose . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was gambling on her sense of adventure , her pride in herself as a liberated woman , and the fact that , as she had said , she was " on the rebound . " Also , there was the possibility that she did like him enough . There had been moments , in fact , when he had wondered who was seducing whomin the taxi on the way to the Vatican City , when her thigh had rested against his , or in the Pio-Clementino Museum when ; as she had bent forward to look at a painting more closely , her breast had caressed his arm . He was beginning to see her differently ; she was less of a romantic innocent than he had thought at first , more of a sensual tease . " I want to ask something of you , " he said . " I do n't expect you to say yes . ' But " He broke off . Isabella was regarding him gravely now . She seemed to have already guessed what he was about to say . " I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She met his gaze for an instant , then looked away . A waiter  | in a swallow-tailed coat passed through the room on his way to the kitchen . She watched the waiter , as if he were of great interest to her , until he disappeared . Then she looked back at Lacev . But still she said nothing . " Nell , I guess I blew it , " he said . " I hope you 're not shocked ? " " No , of course not . " She smiled . " Such a desire is implicit is it not ? when a man and a woman are together ? " " It 's just that we have so little time , " he said . " And I 'm afraid I 'll never see you again . Oh , sure , " he went on , " I know there should be a beautiful courtship first . And when it happens , it should be in lovely circumstances . As it is , it 's awkward . We ca n't stay at my hotelI have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to some little hotel where no one knows us . Maybe that puts you off right there . " " That would make no difference to me . " He looked at her intently . She had n't said " no . " And inexperienced though he was in these matters , he knew that if a woman did n't say " no " immediately , it was a qualified " yes . " " There would be no emotion , " Isabella said . " You must understand that . I am sorry , but my thoughts are still with this other man . " " All I want is to be able to hold you in my arms , " he said , " stroke your hair . " He stopped . He had heard the sincere feeling in his voice , and it confused him . She gazed at him for a moment . Then she slid her hand over the marbletop and curled her fingers in his . " Must I decide now ? " She smiled , careless and playful again . " Let us go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some flowers . " Lacey filled out the registration card . " Mr. and Mrs. John Davis , " he wrote . For the home address , he simply put down " New York City . "  | When he had filled out the card , he placed it on the counter before the portiere . He put a five-thousand-lire note on top of it . " This is for your kindness , " he said . The portiere pocketed the bill . " Thank you " he glanced down at the card " Mr. Davis . I will give you our finest suite . Youand your wifewill be very happy in it , I am sure . " He looked at Isabella , who was standing off to one side , and gave her a quick , charming smile . Isabella returned the smile tentatively . The portiere took down a key and came out from behind the counter . " Follow me , please . " He started across the lobby . Isabella went to Lacey and took his hand . They walked after the portiere . The portiere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . " It is quicker . " They followed him up the stairway . The carpeting on the stairs was worn . There were dirt streaks on the side walls . Isabella had told him that this was a well-known lovers ' hotel , but to Lacey it seemed like any shabby third-class establishment for the thrift-minded tourist . The portiere turned into the second-floor corridor , led them to the end of it , and unlocked a door . Isabella entered the suite first , but , as she did so , Lacey noticed that she paused and exchanged a look with the portiere . Their faces were expressionless , but there seemed to be some silent acknowledgement between them . The suite was well-furnished , almost luxuriously so ; after the drabness of the lobby and the corridor , it was something of a surprise . The sitting room had an abundance of quasiantique pieces , with unstained upholstery and highly polished wood . This suite doubtless represented the one cherished bit of grandeur in the otherwise humble hotel . Lacey went to the window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the darkness . The windows around the courtyard were all shuttered . He took in the view  | quickly and was satisfied with it . He had as much privacy as he needed . He turned back to Isabella . She was standing at a wall mirror , tidying her hair . " You 've been here before , have n't you ? " Isabella turned and looked at him guardedly . " Why do you say that ? " " Oh , I do n't know , " he said . " I got the impression that you and the portiere knew each other . " She smiled slightly . " That portiere has been here a long time . " She paused , then said , " Danilo and I used to come here . " " Danilo and you spent the night here ? " " On several occasions , yes . " " In this suite ? " " Usually . " " That 's just great ! " Lacey said bitterly . " Why did n't you tell me ? " " Because you did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Some difference , yes , " he said . " I would have preferred it if we had gone to another hotel . " " But , Alan , " she said apologetically , " I did not know any other hotel . " She smiled , went to him , and put her hands on his arms affectionately . " Are you really so jealous ? " He had thought he was annoyed because of the technical reasons , because he had unwittingly taken the target to a place where she was , in fact , known . But , as he realized now , it was n't just that . Ridiculous as it seemed , he was jealous . " Yeah , I guess I must be , " he muttered . " Do not be jealous , please , " she said gently . " That was a long time ago . It means nothing now . " She kissed him lightly on the lips . " Let us go to bed . " They went into the next room . This room , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enormous bed draped with a  | satin coverlet . Lacey crossed to the window and closed the shutters . When he turned back , Isabella was already undressing . He started to take off his clothes , too . Isabella undressed as naturally and uninhibitedly as if she were about to step into a bath . Lacey did so more deliberately . He put his socks into his shoes and placed them to one side ; he hung his trousers over the back of a chair , careful to preserve their crease . And all the while he avoided looking at Isabella directly . " You are slow , " he heard her say teasingly . He paused midway through unbuttoning his shirt and looked at her . Her slim body , as he had anticipated , was perfect . But naked , it no longer seemed girlish . Her breasts were fuller and heavier than he had realized , the curve of her hips more mature and defined . She stood still for a moment , knowing he was admiring her , smiling with unabashed womanly pride in herself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coverlet , and slipped in between the sheets . In another minute he joined her . Hesitantly he took her into his arms and kissed her . It was their first serious kiss , and they held it for a long time . It was warm and comforting , but there was little passion in it . She ran her hand along his ribs , his hip , his thigh , trying to arouse him . The desire for her was already there , awake within him . But it was blocked , pinioned , entangled in a confusion of fragmented thoughts and images . He remembered something he had read in a guidebook : when a vestal virgin who had broken her vow of chastity was about to be put to death , the executioner would first make love to her . This had sent a chill through him . It had struck him as obscene that anyone would couple with flesh that was so quickly to be cold and rotting . He caressed her breast . It was warm and it was throbbing her heartbeat . He tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be , cold and clayey . It was n't easy ; he could only associate a woman with life . While he had seen many men in the moment of death , he had never seen the corpse of a woman . Only the picture of one : a photograph in a London newspaper of an unidentified girl in the morgue . He remembered her white beauty and the coldness of her sleep . " What is the matter ? " Isabella asked . " What do you mean ? " " You have such a strange expression ! " Lacey burrowed his face into the pillow and said nothing . Finally he looked up at her . " Let 's not do anything right now . I want to just hold you in my arms . " " All right , " she said , smiling . She entered his embrace and snuggled up against him . " Tell me a story . " " A story ? Why ? " " My papa told me stories . When it was time to go to sleep , he would hug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Lacey was silent for a moment . " Why do n't you tell me a story ? Tell me about Mohammed . " She lifted her head and looked at him , a bit exasperatedly . " Are you jealous of him , too ? " " No , not jealous . I 'm just curious . Curious why you broke up with him . " " For the usual reason , " she said . " Because it could not go on . " Do you love him ? " " No . " " Did you ever love him ? " " No . " " What were you doing ? Playing games with the guy ? " She sat up suddenly . " Do not say that , please . " She was gazing at him with pained intensity . " I am very shaken by this . I am more deeply disturbed than you can understand . " " Then tell me about it . " Her expression went blank . " It is nothing I can talk about . "  | " Because you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainty , as if the matter were settled . He saw the resentment flicker in her eyes . And he sensed her frustration . She wanted to defend herself but felt helpless to do so . She lay back , rested her head on the pillow and stared up at the ceiling . At length she said , " Alan , you seem to be a discreet man . If I tell you , will you promise never to tell any-one ? " " I promise . " Isabella propped herself on one elbow and looked at him . A smile came onto her lips , a rather mischievous smile , like that of a little girl who is about to reveal a delicious secret . " Alan , could you believe that I am like aMata Hari ? " " Sure I could . " He was careful to smile amusedly , as if he were simply going along with the joke . " So what are you ? A spy ? " Her smile faded and she looked away . " I have done things that I regret now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What I have implied . " She seemed unwilling to be more explicit . " You see , " she added , as if it were sufficient explanation , " Mohammed is a very important man in his country . " " How did you get to know him ? " " I met him at a party . He asked me out to dinner , and " She shrugged . " It was the usual thinga sophisticated man trying to make a conquest . " She smiled quickly , ruefully . " I was not hard to conquer . He is attractive , after all . But I did not take it too seriously . A casual affair , you know ? " She paused . When she went on , she spoke more deliberately , choosing her words . " Another man I knewa Jewish man became very interested in our relationship . He asked me to do this thing . And I agreed to do it . " " Was he an Israeli agent ? " " I suppose he was . But I was never sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She thought for  | a moment . " Yes , " she said , " he was an Israeli agent . I am certain of it now . " " Why are you certain now ? " " Because he was murdered . Only a few days ago . I read about it in London . Someone shot him in Amsterdam . An Arab , they think . " Lacey held very still . He was careful to show no reaction . But he let a couple of seconds pass before he spoke . " Well , " he said , " you seem to have gotten yourself into a sticky situation . Why did you agree to it ? " " I am not sure why I did it , " Isabella said . She sat up on the bed , tucked her legs under her , and pondered the question . " I am sympathetic to Israel . My friend Francescashe is my closest friend ; we grew up togetheris from a Jewish family . She fell in love with a sabra , she married him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long letters about it . I have always wanted to go to Israel to see Francescaand her new country . " " Is that why you became a spy ? " he asked incredulously . " Just because of your girl friend ? " " No , it was not only that , " she admitted after a moment . " I suppose I wanted to do something very exciting , very adventurous . And teaching an art class is not exciting or adventurous . Have you never felt this , Alan ? " she asked . " Do you ever long to do something more exciting thanselling hospital supplies ? " " Sometimes , " he said . " Then you understand how I felt . My life was boring , ordinarv . And I had the chance to be a romantic heroine . " She uttered the phrase with weary irony . " So I agreed to it . " " When did you have your change of heart ? " " When I realized what I was doing to Mohammed . " Her voice softened and she looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he wanted to marry me , andI did not love him , it is true , but " she looked at him " you can not sleep with a man over a period of time and not feel something for him , you know ? "  | She lowered her eyes . " Mohammed is a good man , an honorable man , a patriotic manand I was causing him to betray his own people . There came a time when I feltashamed of myself . " " Did he ever suspect ? " " Yes , " she said , " I think , finally , he did . He asked me questions once . Not direct questions . He asked me if I knew certain peopleand what did I feel about the Israelis ? I told him that I did not know these peoplewhich was true and that I had no interest in politics . This seemed to satisfy him . He asked me no more questions . " " Did you get any more information from him ? " " No . After that , he was very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no difference . I had already decided that the game must end . I knew I must break off with him . " " Is there any chance it might start up again ? " The question seemed to surprise her . " No , of course not , " she answered . " It is over . I will never see him again . " " Good , " Lacey said . They both were silent for a while . Isabella looked tired now . Her eyes started to close drowsily . She lay down beside him again and curled up to him , so that her bare knee lightly touched his thigh . " Now you must tell me a story , " she murmured . " What kind of a story ? Sleeping Beauty ? Cinderella ? Something like that ? " " Sleeping Beauty is nice . " Her eyes were closed ; she was breathing evenly , and she seemed already half-asleep . " And Cinderella is nice . And Pichettina and the Garbage Man . " " Pichettina and the Garbage Man ? What 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said , in the dreamy singsong of a child drifting off , " and the Garbage Man took her away . Papa told me , if I was not good , the Garbage Man would come for me . " " One day , " Lacey began , " the Garbage Man came and took Pichettina away . " Isabella 's eyes remained closed , but a slight  | smile cane onto her lips . It was expectant and a bit apprehensive . " He brought her to his hut . He was about to throw her onto the fire . " He paused , uncertain how to end it . " But then he stopped and looked at her . And he thought : She 's such a pretty little girl . And she 's really not so bad , after all . I think I 'll keep her and take very good care of her . ' " He looked at Isabella . The smile had faded from her lips . She was asleep . He watched her for a minute . Her face was peaceful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked as young now as his Christine , and no less innocent . He got out of the bed , moving carefully so as not to disturb the sleeping girl . He went over to his jacket , which was hanging on a chair . He took out the metal tube from the inside pocket . He walked noiselessly past the foot of the bed and went into the bathroom . He closed the door gently behind him and turned on the bathroom light . He extricated the ampule of prussic acid from the metal tube , held it poised between his fingertips , then let it drop into the toilet bowl . IIe flushed . He turned off the light and stepped out into the bedroom . He looked at Isabella again , to make sure the sound of the plumbing had n't wakened her . She was still asleep . He crossed the bedroom and entered the sitting room . He went directly to the window and opened it . He cocked his arm , then threw the metal tube out into the darkness . He heard three plings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was done . As he stood at the window , Lacey felt not relief but a desolating loneliness and a vague sense that , in some way , he had betrayed Sharon . She and the children would be provided for . His will was in good order , and at his solicitor 's office there was a sealed letter to be opened in the event of his death . It detailed the financial arrangements . But , still , there could be no explanation . And he would  | have liked to be able to discuss this with Sharon , to gain the benefit of her understanding . He himself did n't really know what it meant , that someone else 's life should matter more than his own , should matter more than even the welfare of his loved ones . Well , there was no point in brooding about it now . Ile had made his choice . Whether he lived or died , it was the way it had to be . He closed the window and went back into the bedroom . Isabella was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He eased into bed beside her and pulled up the blankets to protect her bare shoulders from the chill air . Then he shut his eyes and drifted off into sleep .  | All morning he tried to reach Aziz . He phoned the caftan shop three times . The first two times , the girl told him that Aziz had n't come in yet . The third time , she said that Aziz was there , but he was busy . He would call Lacey back . He waited throughout the afternoon . He had his lunch sent up to him . He did n't leave his room at all for fear he might miss Aziz 's call . But the phone never rang . Five o'clock came and he decided he could n't wait any longer . He left the hotel and walked over to the Via del Babuino . He would have it out with Aziz , face to face . He would try to make him see the truth , that Isabella was no longer a danger . He would make it clear that he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; it was unprofessional . It was a misguided operation , and he wanted no part of it . He doubted that he could convince the suspicious little Arab . But he might cause him to be uncertain , just enough for him to request a reconfirmation of his orders from his superiors . There would be a chance , then , that the liquidation order might be countermanded.  | There was no one in the caftan shop except the salesgirl . She was reading a copy of Oggi . " I 'm here to see Aziz , " Lacey said to her . The salesgirl looked up from her magazine . " He is not here . " " Where is he ? " She shrugged . " He has gone . " Lacey headed toward the office at the rear . " You can not go in there ! " the salesgirl cried out . He ignored her and threw open the door . A half-empty bottle of Valpolicella stood on the desk , and beside it a wine-stained glass . But there was no one in the office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ' Where can I reach Aziz ? " " I do not know , " the salesgirl said . " He has a home , does n't he ? A phone number ? " " I can not tell you that . " She returned to her magazine . Outside , Lacey stopped in the middle of the street , uncertain of what to do next . He thought of phoning Chubb in London . But he was probably gone for the day , too . Anyway , he had some careful explaining to do , the kind of explaining that was best not ventured on a long distance wire . More than ever , he could n't risk being misunderstood . He retraced his steps , walking more slowly now , and rather aimlessly . When he reached the Via Veneto again , rather than turning down toward his hotel , he headed up toward the livelier stretch by the fashionable cafes . The pavement was crowded : tourists , Romans in their Saturday night best , more than the usual number of young soldiers on leavebersaglieri with their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alpine hats . The prostitutes were already out . They stood in groups on the street corners , in glittery miniskirts and white pants suits , chatting among themselves like indolent , gossipy housewives while they eyed the passing pedestrians .  | As he went by the Cafe de Paris , he heard a voice call out , " Lacey ! Hey , Lacey ! " He stopped and turned . A big blond man sitting alone at a table had his hand upraised in a wave of greeting . He looked familiar , but a thick , drooping mustache masked the lower part of his face , and Lacey could n't place him . Then the man rose , straightening up to a height of almost six and a half feet , and Lacey realized who he was . " Winslade ! For Christ 's sake ! " He went over to him and shook his hand . " I did n't recognize you with the mustache . " Winslade fluffed the reddish-yellow mustache with his fingertips . " Distinguished , do n't you think ? Been working on it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said genially , squeezing Lacey 's arm . " Sit down . Keep me company . " As they sat , he asked , " Care for a beer ? " " No , I do n't think so . " " Do n't blame you . " Winslade picked up his bottle of beer and regarded the label sourly . " All they got is the local . Disgusting stuff ! " " What are you doing in Ronte ? " Lacey asked . " I 'm on holiday . Staying at the Excelsior , " Winslade said , jerking his thumb toward the hotel across the way . " And you ? Holiday , too ? " " Business . " " Oh ? " Winslade 's blue eyes held on him , but his tone was casual as he asked , " Still working for the Company ? " " No . What about you ? In the business still ? " " Great God , no ! I came to my senses , finally . I 'm settled down now . In Leeds . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How 's it going ? " Winslade 's laugh was short and explosive . " Bloody rotten ! What with the cost of petrol and all . That 's why I decided to take a holiday . To keep from going nutters ! " " I 'm in hospital supplies , " Lacey said . " That 's a little more steady . Good times , bad times , people always need hospitals . " " Imagine so , " Winslade said .  | Lacey studied his former colleague with interest and a certain envy . He had his distinct memory of him , but Winslade no longer conformed to it . In that time when they had worked together , when they had holed up in the inn near Nice waiting for their target to be set up , Winslade had seemed to have an indelible South African tackiness to him , with some aspiration to the sharp style , but an inevitable gravy stain on his necktie . Now , for all his poormouthing about his business , he seemed very much the well-put-together , affluent British businessman . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Winslade seemed to sense what he was thinking . A halfsmile emerged beneath his luxuriant mustache . " We had a great old time once , did n't we ? How long ago was it ? Four years ? " " Five years . " " Yes . Well , those things do n't bear thinking on now , do they ? What 's past is past . " It was more than a comment , it was a muted warning do n't bring up that old stuff now ; I 'm done with it . And Lacev accepted it ; he did n't take offense . Because Winslade had changed , and it was more than just the mustache and expensive clothes . He had managed it . He had transformed himself into a respectable citizen , and it was a respectable citizen 's prerogative to forget the unpleasantness in his past . With his large , bony nose and unblinking blue eyes , he still had the features of a hunter . But he was no longer a hunter of men ; more properly , he hunted small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ledger . Maybe it was a good omen , he thought , this chance meeting with Winslade . It might be a sign to him in his own tight situation that , like Winslade , he could go through the danger and the dirt and , in the end , come out of the whole thing clean . " Hey , old chum , we 've got a lot to talk about , " Winslade  | said , beaming at him now . " But let 's go somewhere else . " " Where ? " " Somewhere that has a little of the old atmosphere , you know ? And music . And decent Scotch . " " I do n't know if I have the time " " What ? In this bloody town on Saturday night ? All we 've got is time ! " " A few minutes , maybe , " Lacey conceded . " To catch up on five years ? We 'll do what we can . " He rose . " Come on . I 've got my car . " They left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giant South African stepped along at a rapid clip , covering four feet with each stride , and it was all Lacey could do to keep up with him . As they walked , Winslade filled him in on the details of his new life in Leeds . He was thinking of getting married . There was a divorced ' woman , good in bed and a great sense of humor . " And she has a bit of money , " he said . " That helps , you know . " After they had gone a couple of blocks , Winslade stopped and , gesturing to a parked car , announced , " There she is ! Bluebelle ! " It was a canary-blue Jaguar convertible , with a pampered gleam to it . Winslade patted its hood affectionately . " Is n't she a love ? " " Very nice , " Lacey said . " An XKE . Stereo tape deck , saddle interior , the whole works . The sweetest machine on the road ! " " You do n't have to sell it to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ca n't help myself , old chum . Force of habit . " They got into the Jaguar . " Off we go , Bluebelle , " Winslade murmured as he put the key into the ignition . Bluebelle responded with a purr and glided away from the curb . They drove to the Piazza del Popolo , then turned left into a quiet residential street . " There 's a club along here I 've  | heard about , " Winslade said . " Scacco Matto , they call it . " " What does that mean ? " " Checkmate . " Soon they came to it , a large townhouse that had been converted into a nightclub . Maseratis and Porsches were parked in front . They cruised by , then Winslade turned the car into a dark , narrow street , drove half a block , and parked . Winslade was silent now . He switched off the engine and turned off the lights but made no move to get out of the car . It seemed as if he were about to turn to Lacey to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people suddenly emerged from the building across the street , laughing and talking . One of them , a woman , pointed admiringly at the Jaguar . Winslade gazed at the people , his face expressionless . " Let 's go , " he said , opening the car door . The nightclub took up the entire townhouse ; the interior was luxurious , richly draped and carpeted , with a motif of red and gold . On the ground floor , they passed a series of small roomsa bar with pianist and bass player , a dining room , a loungeand went up a broad central stairway . At the top , they opened a padded door and entered a discotheque , a single long room with a dance floor , a bar , and a table area . They sat at the bar . Winslade ordered a Scotch and soda , Lacey a glass of white wine . When he had his drink in hand , Winslade swung around on his stool and studied the people on the dance floor . Though it was early in the evening , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and convulsing to music that was pitched to an ear-splitting level . In a glass pillar at the edge of the dance floor , a very active young man was working the flashing lights and sound . " Look at them ! " Winslade said . " They 've got a tough life , do n't they ? " There was a bitter edge in his voice now . " Take this one . " He jerked his head toward the dancer nearest them , a curly-headed fellow with a shirt split to his waist and a large  | black crucifix dangling on his hairy chest . " His daddy probably owns a bloody perfume factory ! I bet he 's never had to do some of the things we 've done , eh , Lacey ? " Lacey did n't answer . He had said very little , in fact , since they had gotten out of the car . Something was perplexing him . A small thing , but it bothered him ; it nagged at him like a warning ache . Why had n't they parked in front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spaces open . But Winslade had gone on and had parked on a dark , deserted side street . And what was the meaning of that still moment after they parked ? He had sensed the tautening in Winslade . Then the laughing people had appeared , they were no longer alone , and the moment had passed , leaving Lacey uncertain , thinking he might have imagined it , and yet with an awakened sense of danger . " The smug , oily rich ! " Winslade snarled , still gazing at the dancers . " Those are the blokes we were working for . Look at them ! They never soil their hands . They get proles like us to do their dirty work . And they go out dancing every night . " He looked at Lacey . " Ever think of that when you were working for the Company ? " " I did n't think about people being rich or poor , " Lacey replied . " I thought I was serving my country . " " Did you really ? " Winslade 's smile was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't you ever feel that way ? " " I was working for the Queen 's penny . " He laughed shortly . " And it was n't bloody much , let me tell you ! When you 're cutting up people , " he went on , " you do n't want grand sentiments , do you ? You want a living wage . Now , when I was with Steiner in the Congo , that was all right . Those nigger politicians were hardly what you would call civilized . A bunch of grinning , dressed-up apes . But they paid goddamned well . " Why had he been at the Cafe de Paris ? Lacey wondered . If Winslade was staying at the Excelsior , it would have been  | more logical for him to have been at the Gaffe Doney , across the Veneto in front of his hotel . But he might have been sitting at the Cafe de Paris if he were waiting for someone in particular , someone who was likely to pass by on that side of the street . If he were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Let 's go somewhere else . What about the Piper Club ? That might be more fun . " On the way back to the car , Winslade fell silent . He kept a step ahead of Lacey , as if he were suddenly in a hurry . The last of the twilight was gone and the side street was quite dark . It was totally deserted now . Lacey stayed close to Winslade , concentrating on him , but unsure as to when and how the big man would make his move . Then , as they crossed over to the parked Jaguar , it came to him ; he saw it clearly , the shape and timing of it . Winslade would get in behind the wheel and reach over to open the door on the passenger side . As Lacey leaned forward to step in , the gun barrel would come up into his face . It would be done in a second . Swift and clean . Winslade took out the car keys to open the door on the street side , the driver 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bent over to peer at the lock . Lacey stepped up behind him and grabbed the extended right wrist , grabbed it so hard that the keys dropped from the hand . He yanked down , pulled back , and twisted the arm up behind the broad back . Winslade reacted instantly ; he almost broke free before the pinning grip was secure , straining like a roped bull , dragging Lacey after him a couple of steps . Lacey threw his whole weight against him , and together they toppled forward onto the hood of the car . He held Winslade there , forcing his head down with one hand , so that his cheek was pressed flat against the steel , and , with the other , exerting an upward pressure on his arm .  | Winslade was gasping with pain . " Ease up , old chum , " he whispered . Lacey let up slightly , lessening the pressure just enough to permit the other man to talk . " Who are you working for ? " he asked . " The same people you 've been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for them ? " " You 've been terminated . " " That 's why you 're here ? To terminate me ? " " And to finish your job for you . " " Why do n't they give me a chance to explain ? " " I do n't know . They say you 've cracked up . That 's all they told me . " Winslade managed a smile . " You seem sane enough to me . But you know how it is . You do n't question it . " Lacey felt for a gun under the jacket . There was none . He pulled Winslade to a standing position and patted his waistband . Still nothing . He was puzzled ; then it occurred to him . In his sock . He raised his right foot to tap Winslade 's ankle . It was a mistake . For one moment , he was off-balance ; in that moment , he felt a hand come up under his crotch . The powerful torso twisted , and Lacey was pitched forward over the hood . He went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his feet on the other side of the Jaguar . He whirled around and saw that Winslade was stooping to reach for something at his ankle . Lacey knew better than to make a run for it . He would be an easy target at five yards . He backed away along the narrow sidewalk , keeping the car between them , sure that Winslade would n't fire through his beloved Bluebelle . But he was only gaining seconds . He was trapped . Realizing it , he felt no fear , but only fury , fury at his own helplessness . Winslade was coming around the front of the Jaguar , carefully , unhurriedly . His hand appeared , gripping an automatic ;  | then his face , its expression abstracted , hawklike , the cold eyes intent on the kill . Lacey pressed back against a wall . His hand came in contact with plastic , the bound neck of a bag of garbage . He seized it and swung it with all his strength . The bulging green bag struck just as Winslade was setting in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it with an echoing blast , and hit Winslade in the chest , driving him back a step . Lacey turned and ran down the street , losing himself in the protecting darkness .  | Winded and limping , he ran up the four flights of stairs . At the top , he leaned against the wall exhaustedly , caught his breath , then pounded on the Rinaldis ' door . He heard the clink of plates within , but there was no immediate response . He pounded again . He heard footsteps now . The door opened and Antonio Rinaldi looked out at him . " Alan ! What a pleasure ! Come in ! " Lacey brushed past him . " Where 's Isabella ? " he asked , looking around . " Is she here ? " " Yes . We are eating dinner . " " Send her out , please . Tell her it 's very important . " Isabella appeared in the dining room doorway . " Alan , what is it ? " He went to her and took her by the arm . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . " He started to draw her toward the door , but she resisted . " You are being very rude ! " she protested . " We are in the middle of " " Never mind that ! Come on ! "  | The urgency in his tone silenced her . She met his gaze questioningly for a moment , then turned to Antonio , who was looking at them in bewilderment . " Ritornero subito , " she said . They left the apartment , descended the stairs , and came out onto the street . Lacey glanced up and down the Via delle Muratte . Men were loitering by the doorways , but they all had the homey , working-class look of people who belonged to the street . So far , so good , he thought . Aziz 's network was a little careless ; they had neglected to post a lookout outside the Rinaldis ' building . As they walked toward the Trevi Fountain , Lacey assessed the situation . Winslade , of course , would n't try it alone now ; he would call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phone call , perhaps several . Also , the fact that cars were barred from the Trcvi Fountain neighborhood would create a problem for Winslade . He would need more manpower for an encircling net , and they would have to move in on foot . Allowing for these factors , Lacey estimated that , at that point , Isabella and he had a minimum of ten minutes , but probably not more than a half hour . There was , as always , a crowd in front of the Trevi Fountain . But the fountain was n't as he remembered it , bright and exuberant . Unlit as it now was , the statuary had a funerary somberness to it ; the huge Neptune in his chariot , the tritons and horses were barely visible in the murk . The shadowy assemblage of tourists and young Roman bucks seemed slightly sinister , as if it were gathered for some common , unholy purpose . Lacey and Isabella went down the steps to the sunken level by the basin of the fountain . He led her over to a stone bench @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rushing water would cover their conversation , he knew , but he glanced around anyway , to make sure they could n't be overheard . There was no one immediately nearby except two blonde German  | girls who , with their backs to the fountain , were tossing coins over their shoulders into the water . Some pomaded Roman youths were standing on the steps , eyeing the German girls with interest . Lacey turned to Isabella . He had been so watchful for possible dangers that he had hardly looked at her , but now he took her in . She was wearing a dark blue blouse and a blue and white print skirt . Her expression was calm , without anger , simply patient , as she awaited an explanation . " Well ? " she said . " Will you now please tell me the meaning of this ? " " You have to leave Rome right away , " he said . " This minute . " She stared at him , astonished . " I do not understand . Why ? " " If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Arabs have ordered your death . " The color faded from her face . " Because of Mohammed ? " she asked , her voice hushed with shock . " But that is finished ! " " They do n't believe it . " She looked away as she tried to comprehend it . Then suddenly she gazed at him again , with a new wonderment in her eves . " How do you know this ? " " I was the one who was sent here to kill you . " Her expression froze . Then a look of anguish spread over her face . " No ! " she whispered , shaking her head slowly . " No ! " " Isabella , listen to me ! " He gripped her by the arms . She glanced down at his hands fearfully and tried to pull away from him . " I 'm not going to hurt you , " he insisted . " I ca n't hurt you . All I want to do now is get you out of here safely . Please , trust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She looked into his eyes with uncertainty , a childlike helplessness . " If you can get out of Rome , " he went on , " you 'll be all right . Once you 're up north , you can hide out . Somewhere near your home , maybe . " He paused . " Do you understand ? "  | She nodded dazedly . He looked up and saw that there was a new face in the chattering , smiling group of youths on the steps . The newcomer was staring , not at the German girls , but at them . " Let 's go , " Lacey said , rising and drawing Isabella to her feet . " But we must go back , " she said . " I do not have my clothes . My money . " " There 's no time for that ! " He glanced at the group on the steps again . The boy was chatting with his companions ; he seemed to be paying no attention to them now . " Come on , " Lacey said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the steps , back onto the street . He looked up at the large schedule on the wall of the station and scanned the departure times . " Torino22:20 Bin 20 .. . Milano22:45Bin 18 ... Venezia20:15 Bin 3 ... " " We 'll take the train to Venice , " Lacey said . He had decided that he would go with her . At first , he had intended only to put her on the train . But the boy at the Trevi Fountain had disturbed him ; it was possible they had n't eluded Aziz 's network , after all . He could n't leave her , he realized now ; he had to make sure that Isabella did , in fact , reach safety . Isabella was looking unhappy . " I do not know anyone in Venice , " she said . " Good . Then they wo n't think to look for you there . Anyway , we ca n't afford to wait two hours for these other trains . " She shrugged and nodded . Her shock had worn off , but still she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hands , but she seemed to be doing so , not from any faith in him , but from a kind of weary Latin fatalism . They stood in one of the ticket lines . As they waited , Lacey  | glanced around the huge , cavernous station , checking it over for the third or fourth time . It was only moderately busy . A few people were passing through the departure gate ; a few others were sitting on the benches , waiting for trains . Nearby , some American hippies were sprawled out on the marble floor , their knapsacks and rolled sleeping bags strewn about them . They looked sullen and joyless . Lacey was about to turn back , but then his attention was caught by a man who was dialing a number at a public phone , a shabby fellow in a shapeless jacket and work pants . Lacey had already noticed him . A minute before , the man had been standing by the newsstand , reading a newspaper . There was no particular reason to suspect this man , but Lacey was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mistake in not taking the time to get a change of clothes for Isabella and himself . They could be identified by their general appearance and what they were wearing , his brown tweed jacket and red-striped tie , her print skirt and blue blouse . After a couple of minutes in the line , they reached the window and Lacey bought the tickets . He had been silent for a while , and Isabella was gazing at him worriedly . " Is everything all right ? " she asked . " I do n't know . " He looked over at the man . He was once again lounging by the newsstand , flipping through his newspaper . " We have twelve minutes , " Lacey said , glancing up at the big clock . " Let 's get on the train now and see what happens . " They headed for the departure gate . As they passed through , Lacey looked back over his shoulder . The man , the newspaper tucked under his arm , was sauntering after them . Beyond the departure gate , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ends , to the adjoining streets . At first they seemed to be alone in the arcade . But then Lacey looked to his left and saw two well-dressed men turn in from the  | street and head toward them at a leisurely pace . He looked to his right and saw two other men coming toward them from the opposite end . He recognized this second pair immediately ; they were Renato and his tall Arab companion . Lacey took Isabella 's arm and quickened his step . They crossed the arcade and came out onto the platform by the tracks . He went over to the beverage stand and pretended to study the labels on the bottles of mineral water and fruit juice while he tried to figure out what to do . Isabella looked back at the arcade nervously . " What is happening ? " she asked . " They 've found us . " At that moment the four men came out onto the platform . The two pairs stopped some distance apart and simply stood , watching them expressionlessly . The two men in silk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Arab were in their usual casual attire , but they were wearing jackets now : Renato , a light blue summerweight over his open-necked shirt ; the Arab , a green corduroy over his black sweater . Judging by the hang of the buttoned jackets , Lacev guessed that all four men had guns . Isabella clutched at his sleeve fearfully . He put his hand on hers to calm her . " Do n't worry , " lie told her . " They wo n't do anything right now . Not with those guys here , " he said , jerking his head toward the two dress-uniformed policemen who were standing at the carabinieri station . Isabella looked at the carabinieri , noticing them for the first time . " We must tell them , " she said quickly . " And how would you explain it to them ? That you 're an Israeli spy and these people want to kill you ? " This gave her pause . " No , " she said , after a moment , " I do not want anyone to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Ile looked at the four men again . None of them had moved . " I suppose they intend to keep us company on the train . "  | " But we can not go on the train now . " " We can seem to . Maybe they think I 'm stupid . Let 's hope so . " He started toward the waiting train on Track 3 . Isabella stayed beside him , gripping his arm tensely . " Stay cool , " he said . " Just do everything I doand do n't hesitate . " They walked half the length of the train . Lacey stopped by the entrance of a car and said , " We 'll get on here . " He looked back . The two men in silk suits were ambling down the stone ramp after them . The bigger one was a step ahead of the other . Lacey noticed , as he peered at him , that he had the scarred eyebrows and broken nose of a onetime prizefighter . Isabella stepped into the car and he followed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were waiting in their seatsthen pulled open the door on the other side . " Quickly now ! " he whispered , motioning to her to go through . Isabella swiftly stepped out onto the next ramp . He joined her , then paused to size up the situation before them . Track 2 was empty ; there was a darkened train idle on Track 1 . Beyond that was the baggage room and the street . Lacey jumped clown onto Track 2 . Isabella clambered after him . He crossed the tracks , got up onto a coupling link between two cars of the darkened train , then , with a long , springing step , leaped onto the baggage platform . He turned back . Isabella was climbing up onto the coupling linkwith fair ease , he noted ; she was at least as nimble as he . He reached out , caught her as she threw herself toward him , and swung her onto the platform . They rushed through a large room where shouting baggage handlers were throwing suitcases about . Glass doors let them out onto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dark far side . Lacey stopped and looked back , but he saw no figures in pursuit . They started toward the northwest , half walking , half running . When they were clear of the railroad station , they eased  | up their pace . They were on the Viale delle Terme now , a quiet , tree-lined boulevard . The moon was out , but with every other streetlight turned off , there was a darkness that concealed them from anyone more than half a block away . " What will we do now ? " Isabella asked . " Well , we obviously ca n't get out by train . And they probably have the airport and bus terminals covered . " " Do they have so many people ? " " As many as they need . With all that oil money , they could rent the entire Mafia for the night . " " Then how can we leave Rome ? " " Do you have a friend with a car ? " he asked . " One who cares enough for you to drive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course . " " No , not Antonio . They 'll be watching his building . Anyone else ? " Isabella thought for a moment . " Yes , there is someone who would do it . " " Can you reach this person ? " " He is probably at home . " " Call him right away . " They were entering the Piazza della Repubblica . There was a phone booth in front of the Grand Hotel , and Isabella went into it to make the call . She was on the phone for about three minutes . Lacey , standing watch just outside , could understand none of her rapid Italian , muted as it was by the glass between them . But he could hear the intense emotion in her voice . When she came out of the booth , she said , " It is all right . He will do it . " " Now ? " She nodded . " He will wait for us at Santa Maria in Trastevere . " They got into a cab in front of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trastevere , Lacey asked , " Who is this friend , by the way ? " " Danilo , " she replied . " Oh , I see . " He studied her for a moment . Isabella was staring before her . She seemed preoccupied , not by her present danger , but by some older , deeper concern . " I guess he must still care for you , " he said . " Yes , " she said . Lacey pursued it no further . They sat in silence as they proceeded down the Via Nazionale . From time to time he glanced back through the rear window at the line of cars behind them , but there seemed to be nothing out of the ordinary . Soon they crossed the Tiber and entered Trastevere . As the cab came to a stop just short of the Piazza Santa Mariathis piazza , too , was forbidden to trafficthe bell in the old church was tolling the half hour . They got out and walked the last few yards . The piazza was bustling with a Saturday night 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were operating at capacity , and waiters were swiftly snaking between the sidewalk tables , deftly balancing trays . Near the fountain in the center of the piazza a crowd had gathered around a man who was playing popular music on an ornate record player that rather resembled an organ grinder . His loudspeakers were blaring out some current hit , sung by a cheerful girl vocalist . When they entered the piazza , Isabella stopped , looked , then rushed over to a man in a belted tan jacket who was standing in front of Sabatini . They embraced . As she clung to him , he kissed her lightly on her hair and check . Lacey went over to them slowly , feeling awkward now , and a bit embarrassed . Isabella turned as he came up to them . " Alan , this is Danilo . " Isabella 's former lover , it turned out , was much older than  | she , several years older than Lacey . He had graying temples and a lean , bronzed , handsome face . " Pleasureto meet you , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Lacey said . " I ca n't tell you how grateful I am that you 're going to help us . " Danilo looked uncertain as he strained to comprehend the words . Isabella quickly translated for him . " Does he understand what we want him to do ? " Lacey asked her . " Yes , " she said . " He will drive us up to Tuscany tonight . " " And does he know why ? " " Non e necessario , " Danilo said . " If Isabellaneeds me " He took her hand tenderly . " Let 's get started , then , " Lacey said . Danilo 's car was parked a couple of blocks from the piazza in a small square at the end of a side street . It was a green Alfa Romeo sedan , brightly polished and quite new . Lacey got into the front seat beside Danilo , and Isabella sat in the back . " Nice car , " Lacey commented . " Grazie , " Danilo said . He started the engine and backed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Y turn . " I have this year " As he moved the car forward , turning to go back down the street , he searched for the word : " corn-prato ? " The word he was looking for was " bought , " but before be could find it a bullet tore through the side of his head , spraying Lacey with blood and bits of brain . " Down ! " Lacey shouted to Isabella , throwing himself across Danilo 's lap . He grabbed the steering wheel , kicked the limp foot away from the accelerator and floored the pedal . He was dimly aware of Isabella 's scream and of the bullets ripping through the windows of the cartwo more in quick sequencebut as be steered blindly , completing the turn , he concentrated totally on the image in his mind , the image he had seen the instant before Danilo was killed : the red Lam-  | borghini fifteen yards down the street , and , standing by the left headlight , the man with the broken nose , aiming a silenced automatic . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the car toward the space he saw in the image , the narrow gap between the Lamborghini and the opposite curb . There was a metallic screech as the Alfa Romeo scraped the side of the other car ; then they were past it . Lacey raised his head now , saw an intersection looming ahead , and turned sharply around the corner . He hit the brake . " Are you all right ? " he asked , turning back . Isabella was sitting up straight , her face contorted with horror as she stared at Danilo 's head , bloody and still on the head rest . Her lips moved convulsively , but she made no sound . Lacey opened the door and pushed the body out onto the street . " No ! " Isabella cried out . " We must help him ! " " There 's nothing we can do , " he said , sliding into the driver 's seat . " He 's dead . " He stepped on the accelerator , and the car shot forward . " Stop ! " she screamed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rearview mirror , he saw the red Lamborghini turn the corner and follow them . He had only a one-block lead , and he guessed it might not be enough . He turned into the Viale di Trastevere and drove south . The red Lamborghini , low-slung and powerful , tailed them easily , like a flat-headed shark pursuing a weaker , slower fish . Lacey had the pedal to the floor , but the Lamborghini was gradually drawing nearer . He could already make out the shadowy silhouettes of the two men in the front . He went through a stop light . The Lamborghini went through it too , narrowly missed a collision with a bus , swerved , and skidded , losing a couple of seconds . Then it picked up speed and started closing in again .  | He heard Isabella crying , an agonized whimper , but there was nothing he could say to her . He felt guilty , angry with himself , because he knew it was his fault ; he had n't taken enough care . He had foolishly assumed they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But now he remembered that he had seen a red Lamborghini in the line of cars that had followed them out to Trastevere . He turned left to cross a bridge . He could n't outrace the Lamborghini , but there was a chance he might elude it in the heavier traffic on the east side of the Tiber . When they came off the bridge , the turned north up the Lungotevere . The Lamborghini slipped into the line of traffic , six cars behind . Lacey weaved from lane to lane , passing cars , trying to forge ahead , get lost in the pack . But luck was against him . When he swerved to the outside lane , the Alfa Romeo was suddenly boxed in by cars in front , behind , and to the left . Meanwhile , the Lamborghini was moving up on a clear stretch of the next lane . In a few seconds it would be close enough for the gunman to have a clear shot at them . They were coming to the Ouattro Capi bridge . He could see the synagogue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Marcellus . Just before the huge , ancient theater , the road broadened into a wide shoulder that overlooked some ruins . " Lie down on the floor ! " he shouted to Isabella . He turned off onto the shoulder . In the rearview mirror , he saw the Lamborghini whip out of the traffic and follow . Lessening his speed only slightly , he threw the Alfa Romeo into a circling turn so perilously tight that for one moment the car tilted on two wheels . He came out of the turn at a right angle to the path of the Lamborghini . The other driver hit his brakes , but he could n't react in time to evade him . Lacey aimed the nose of the Alfa Romeo at the red flank , floored the gas pedal , and rammed the Lamborghini . The Alfa Romeo spun around wildly a couple of times , then came to a jolting stop . It had struck a low stone wall at the  | edge of the shoulder . Lacey sat motionless for a stunned moment , waiting for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He looked through the shattered side window and saw the Lamborghini near the end of the wall , lying on its top , the wheels spinning . There was no sign of movement within the crushed interior . " Are you hurt ? " Isabella 's voice was soft and anxious . He looked behind him . Isabella had risen to her knees and was gazing over the top of the scat at him . Her eyes were redrimmed , but alert now . " I 'm fine , " he said . He got out of the car and regarded the wrecked Lamborghini uncertainly . There was something he needed desperatelya gunbut he was n't sure it would be safe to go over and get one . A silk-sleeved arm stuck out of the passenger side window at a fractured angle . It was very still and the fingers were limp ; the broken-nosed gunman , he guessed , was dead . But he could hear a low , insistent moan . The driver was still alive . Isabella emerged from the car , stood beside him , and stared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " she asked . " I 'll go take a look , " he said . " You stay here . " He was about to walk over , but first he glanced back to check the road . A little gray Fiat turned out of the traffic and headed toward them . It was the most commonplace machine in Rome , but this one looked familiar . He hesitated only an instant . " Run ! " he cried , pulling Isabella after him . They hurried clown some steps to the ruins below . It was an open stretch , littered with fragments of pillars and foundation stones . On the left was the Theater of Marcellus , with cats wandering back and forth behind the rusted iron bars of its gates ; on the right was an early Christian church . As they reached the bottom of the steps , he heard the Fiat skid to a stop above them . Looking up , he saw the car doors fly  | open and Renato and the Arab leap out . Lacey and Isabella ran , crossing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the path that climbed the Capitoline Hill . At the path 's first turn , where it became deep cobblestoned steps , Lacey looked back again . Renato and the Arab were running across the road and approaching the path . " Come on , " he urged . Lacey and Isabella ran the rest of the way up the hill , along the twisting , turning path , past thick bushes and small trees . Every so often , in the darkness before them , a shadowy cat would freeze , hiss , then scurry off into the shrubbery . Soon they reached the top . They ran along the brim of the hill , went through an arch and into the Piazza dcl Campidoglio . They dashed across the piazza , past the large equestrian statue of Marcus Aurelius , heading for the stairway that went down the other side of the Capitoline Hill . It began near the bell tower . They quickly descended the long , straight flight of steps . At the bottom was a road , deserted at this time of night ; beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moonlight , ghostly in the nocturnal quiet . As they neared the bottom , Isabella stumbled and fell . Lacey pulled her to her feet . " Are you okay ? " " Yes , I am all right , " she assured him . But her chest was heaving rapidly . He himself was struggling for breath , and there was a sharp pain in his bad foot . " We ca n't stop now , " he said . Holding her by the arm to steady her , he drew her down the last few steps . Renato and the Arab appeared at the top of the hill . They started down the steps toward them . Lacey went to the right , heading for the bend in the road . They were halfway there , almost abreast of the towering Temple of Saturn , when a car suddenly appeared around the turn . It was a canary-blue Jaguar . He could barely discern the  | broad-shouldered figure behind the wheel . The Jaguar came toward them slowly . Lacey turned in the other direction , but Renato and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . They were cut off on both sides . Behind them was a five-foot-high stone wall topped with inward-slanting barbed wire . Lacey climbed up onto it and pulled Isabella up with him . The Jaguar came to a stop beside them . In the moment they were poised on the top of the wall , Lacey , his back to the road , sensed Winslade drawing his automatic , straightening his arm to aim . They jumped simultaneously , each putting a foot onto a strand of barbed wire , then stepping out into the air and dropping to the ground eight feet below . They pitched forward as they landed , but scrambled to their feet immediately , hurried down a dirt incline , and ran a few yards beyond it to the flat foundation stones that were all that remained of the Arch of Tiberius . From these stones they jumped clown , some four and a half feet , to a pavement of cracked marble slabs . They crouched behind the foundation stones . Lacey , peeking over the edge of a stone , saw Winslade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hawk nose and bushy mustache were dimly visible . Winslade 's head turnedRenato and the Arab were approaching then disappeared . " Let 's go , " Lacey whispered . They clashed across a narrow open stretch and took cover behind the Rostra . He tried to decide what to do next . He did n't want to risk a run for it in the open . The moonlight gave enough visibility for a marksmanand Winslade , he knew , was one of the best . He glanced about quickly , looking for a hiding place . Just a few feet from them was a ground-level opening in the Rostra itself . He went to it and peered in . Three steps led down into a tunnel that was high enough for a man to stand in and ran for about five yards , ending at an open fissure in the middle of the Rostra . Beckoning to Isabella to follow , he  | entered the tunnel . It was totally dark within ; all he could see was the shaft of moonlight at the end of the tunnel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of it were low , arched brick caves , left over , he supposed , from some archaelogical excavation under the Rostra . In one of them , subterranean water had welled up , wetting a broken , coneshaped fragment of marble . Looking up through the fissure , Lacey could see the section of wall by the Temple of Saturn . Winslade was climbing over the wall , with Renato and the Arab close behind . When all three were inside , they whispered together briefly , then walked on . He could no longer see them , but he concentrated on the sound of their footsteps . The heaviest step , Winslade 's , went straight on through the Forum . A lighter step came in their direction fairly rapidly . In another moment he saw the man it was Renatopassing in front of the tunnel . He walked on and out of sight . His footsteps receded as he turned and went down the Via Sacra . That accounted for Winslade and Renatobut what about the Arab ? Now he heard a slow , cautious step quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind to search the ruins at that end of the Forum . The tentative step was approaching the opening of the tunnel . Isabella was pressed back against the stone , almost invisible in the darkness at the center of the tunnel . He bent close to her ear , whispered " Keep very quiet , " then slipped past her and edged up to the opening . He held still and waited . The footstep stopped just outside . The Arab 's face appeared as he leaned forward to look into the tunnel . Lacey whipped his arm around his head , gave it a sharp twist , and broke his neck . He pulled the Arab all the way into the tunnel , stretched him out and patted him up and down . " Damn it , " he muttered , " he does n't have a gun . " Isabella said nothing . He had heard her stifled gasp at the  | moment he killed the man . Now her indistinct form was still and silent . Even in the darkness , he could sense her horror , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , straightening up . " We ca n't stay in here . " He reached out to take her arm . She retreated from his touch , but he gripped her firmly and led her past the dead body out of the tunnel . They crept by the Lapis Niger , then dashed across the Via Sacra and took cover behind a jagged free-standing wall of the Basilica Aemilia . The Forum on this side was sunk far below the level of the adjoining street ; they could n't get out there . At the same time , he knew it would be unwise to go back to the spot where they had come in . The wall by the Temple of Saturn was on a height and visible from the entire Forum . The best way out , he decided , was at the opposite end , where , as he remembered , there was a low fence on level ground . Crouched low , they moved through what had once been the inner court of the Basilica Aemilia , through the weedovergrown fragments of the great assembly hall . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only one column was left whole . The front wall had crumbled into odd-shaped remnants like jigsaw pieces resting on their edges , but a section of it was continuous for some length . Hiding behind it , they went to the far side of the Basilica . Lacey cautiously peeked around the end of the wall section . They were directly across from the three tall pillars of the Temple of Castor , which , rising high on its mound , dominated the Forum . He heard Renato 's footsteps again , then saw him coming back up the Via Sacra . He was holding a revolver now . On the other side of the Forum , Winslade came into view . He too was walking back . Lacey withdrew behind the eroded brick and waited while the footsteps diminished in the distance . Soon they would notice that the Arab was missing . Then , he knew , they would  | come back again , searching for their companion . They could n't wait behind that piece of wall much longer ; they had to make their move . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sacra . It was empty now . He listened , but he no longer heard the footsteps . Instead , a new sound was cutting through the stillness of the Forum . Somewhere , not far off , dogs had started barking . " Let 's go , " he whispered . They stole noiselessly across the Via Sacra and went around the Regium . The dogs were barking more excitedly now , and they seemed nearer . Lacey and Isabella passed by the small circular Temple of Vesta , poised on its ten-foot-high mound , and crossed the brick bridge that led into the House of the Vestal Virgins . As they entered its atrium , Lacey glanced up and froze for an instant . Winslade was standing between two pillars of the Temple of Castor , looking down at them . Lacey grabbed Isabella 's hand and they ran through the atrium , past the long line of headless stone vestal virgins . His heart was pounding , but the technician part of his brain was still working , making an instant , cool assessmenta high angle , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sure shot . When they reached the second of the three rose-bordered ponds , he glanced back quickly over his shoulder . He saw not one but two figures : Winslade on the high mound , his automatic drawn , and much closer , at a lower level , Renato standing in the Temple of Vesta , his arm extended , his revolver aimed . In that despairing instant , Lacey realized they were n't going to make it . Isabella tripped ; her hand slipped from his , and suddenly she was behind him , face down on the pavement . He turned back and threw himself over her , shielding her with his body . He braced himself , vaguely aware of the ecstatic barking very nearby , but listening only for the crack of the revolver . There was no gunshot . Instead , he heard a cry of pain . He looked up . Two Doberman pinschers were clinging onto  | Renato ; one was hanging from his right arm , the other had its teeth sunk into his throat . Renato was swaying in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhere just outside the atrium , a night watchman shouted , " Non muovere ! " In the Temple of Castor , Winslade turned and looked over at Renato and the dogs . He raised his automatic , aimed , and fired . Renato 's head jerked as the bullet ripped through it . With the dogs still hanging from him , he plunged into the darkness . Lacey looked up at the Temple of Castor . Winslade was gone . They got to their feet and ran to the end of the atrium , to the left through a maze of roofless rooms , out onto the Via Sacra , and uphill on the moonlit path toward the distant fence .  | They spent the night in a little hotel near the Colosseum . It was a grim room that looked out on a wall , but they were too exhausted to care . They said very little to each other . They shared some leftover veal that was sent up from the kitchen , then prepared for bed . Isabella took her bath first , then Lacey his . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up beneath the blankets , her eyes closedalready asleep , he thought . He slipped into bed beside her , turned off the lamp , rested his head on her pillow , and inhaled the fragrance of her hair . Without a word she turned to him and entered his arms . He made love to her . It was gentle , unhurried . He could n't tell whether she really desired him , but she embraced him firmly , tenaciously , as if she were afraid he might vanish in her arms . Just before they climaxed , he remembered that the man she had loved had died that night . He sensed it was that man she was thinking of then , not him . The next morning , as they sat on the bed eating the drab  | " continental " breakfast the hotel providedslightly stale brioche , rolls , and coffeeIsabella asked suddenly , " How did it happenthat you do what you do ? " Lacey carefully buttered half a brioche and did n't answer immediately . He saw the image of it , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man with the dyed black hair , and behind him in the alley the lit-up neon sign . Navona 1000 . The last moment he still had a choice . " It was like most things in life , " he said finally . " I backed into it . " " And you never feel " she hesitated " ashamed ? " " The people who decide these things should feel ashamed . Not me . " Rather timidly she ventured , " It is murder , is it not ? " He looked at her for a moment . " Let me ask you this . When you were getting that information from Mohammed and passing it on to the Israelis , did it ever occur to you that hundreds or thousands of people might die because of it ? " " No . If something happened , I did not know . It was simply information . " " So you saw yourself as a romantic heroine , right ? And the Israeli pilot who bombs a village with old men , women , and children in ithe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schoolchildren in a classroomhe 's a revolutionary martyr . I 've never hurt an innocent personand I 'm a thug . " " Is your work so pure ? " Her tone was challenging now . " Do all your victims so deserve to die ? " " They are in my gameor in your gameor they 're politicians who are in the game of power , which means playing around with other people 's lives . That 's not innocence . " " Danilo was innocent , " she said softly . " And he 's dead . " " Do n't blame me for that . " With the reminder , he did in fact feel guilty again . " Sloppy work . That man was n't a professional . "  | " And you are a professional ? What does that mean ? You are perfect ? You do not make mistakes ? " " No , I do n't . Because I never let myself get emotionally involved . " He paused , then quietly added , " Or I did n't until now . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said with a slight smile . " In my work , emotions are dangerous . " He knew it was useless trying to explain to her , but still he went on . " There was an opera I saw the other night . The man in itSparafucileloved his sister . And because he loved her , he killed an innocent girl . I felt for the poor guy . It could n't ever be the same for him again . " " You are talking about Rigoletto ? " She stared at him in astonishment . " Sparafucile was a bad man ! " " He was all right . " He rose , crossed to where his jacket was hanging , took out his wallet , and opened it . " What are you doing ? " Isabella asked . " Just looking for something . " Ile sat beside her again and searched through his wallet . " Who are these ? " she asked , pointing at a snapshot in a cellophane window of the wallet . It was a photograph of Sharon , Christine , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their garden in South Stoke . " My wife and my kids , " Lacey replied . " It does n't do them justice . I took the shot myself . It may be overexposed . " Isabella gazed at the snapshot , her smile fixed . " Your wife is very pretty . " " I guess she is . " As he regarded the radiant faces , his anxiety ebbed ; he felt warmed and comforted . " Christine is the real beauty in the family . " He pointed at the spring-frocked little figure . " You can see she already looks a lot like Sharon Sharon is my wife . They say Jimmy takes after me . But I do n't know . I think he 's more like his mother . " Isabella was no longer looking at the photograph . She was  | staring at him , her eves dangerously bright . " Bigliacco ! " She spat out the word . " Porco ! " " What ? " The suddenness of her anger startled him . " What 's the matter ? You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little thing , no ? " Her voice was trembling with rage . " So you do not even tell me ! " " Why are you getting so upset ? " he asked uncomprehendingly . " My God , up until yesterday I was trying to kill you ! " " That is not the same thing ! " She quickly turned away , bent her head , put her hand to her mouth , and in a muffled voice cried out miserably , " Why did you make love to me ? " " I 'm sorry , " he said . He vaguely understood that the terror of death was nothing she could confront , the loss of Danilo too deep a grief to release , but this was something she could focus upon , the distressing fact that , once again , she had gotten mixed up with a married man . " But , you know , " he went on , " I was n't going to touch you . You were the one who made it happen . " " I thought it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She seemed spent now , almost apathetic . " Is that not why you saved me ? " He stared at her . " No , that is not why I saved you . What do you think I am ? " " You are what you tell me , " she said wearily . " A married man who kills people . " " Whatever I did , I did because " His glance fell on the photograph , Sharon and the children smiling up at him , and he did n't complete the sentence . He poked at the photograph abstractedly for a moment , straightening it in its cellophane window . " Okay , " he said finally . " We ca n't think about that now . We have to figure out what to do . We ca n't stay here . They 're probably all over this neighborhood right now , searching for us . " He looked at her . She was gazing off blankly . " Are you listening ? "  | She took a deep breath , then nodded . " Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Can we not rent one ? " " Too risky . They may be watching the car rental places . Some of themor all of themI ca n't be sure . But I 'm not taking any more chances . " He paused thoughtfully . " If a stranger could rent a car for us , " he said , " someone they would never suspect " She looked at him perplexedly . " Who ? " " There was a man I met the other night " He searched through the wallet again and finally found the card . He glanced at the name written on it and said it aloud . " William Hawkwood . " Just inside the entrance gate of Hawkwood 's villa , in the center of the broad path , there was a round Roman tomb about fifteen feet high . Some bits and pieces of marble decoration remained on ita fragmented hawk , a long-billed bird , a five-petaled flower . A jungle of weeds and wildflowers was growing on its top . " The sarcophagus is still in there , " Hawkwood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's empty , of course . " Lacey stooped and peered through the ground-level opening . He saw the sarcophagus , which looked rather like an abandoned stone bathtub , some broken pieces of marble , and nothing else . " The body , " Hawkwood went on , " along with whatever was buried with it , was stolen centuries ago . So there 's no way of knowing who this gentleman was . I 've always been curious about him , " he said , in his sardonic drawl . " Whoever he was , he thought this would make him remembered forever . " Ile laughed . " Poor old bugger ! This is his immortality " he slapped the weathered tomb " such as it is . " Lacey listened politely , but only half-attentively . For all  | the tranquillity of the spot , the seductiveness of the warm , scented air , his system was still on alert , checking out each sound around them , the twittering of the bird in the tall umbrella pine that rose up on the other side of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pasture . He heard an occasional car whiz bywith surprising infrequency for an Italian Sunday , but then , they were four miles out on the Appian Way . Hawkwood was regarding him pleasantly . Standing in the sunshine , casual in his blue polo shirt , he looked tanned and almost wholesome . Lacey knew he was waiting for him to comment on the tomb ; Hawkwood had brought him out there especially to admire it . " It sure is something , " Lacey said . " After all , not everyone has a tomb in his front yard . " " We have no lack of tombs around here , actually . There 's a man clown the road who built his house right on top of a particularly large one . " " Really ? " Lacey tried to look impressed , but he was n't thinking about tombs or houses at all . " If you do n't mind , " he asked suddenly , " may I get back to my problem for a moment ? " " No , I do n't mind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And he had seemed only minimally surprised when Lacey and Isabella had turned up at his villa . His tolerant hospitality , Lacey supposed , was really the curiosity of a writer who is always open to new material . Lacey had simply said that Isabella and he were in flight for their lives . Hawkwood had asked just two questions . " Is it venal or political ? " " Political , " Lacey had replied . " Who is the other side ? " " The Arabswith some help from the Mafia . " That had seemed to be enough for Hawkwood . He had  | agreed to rent a car for them , and had asked only one thing in returnthat they give him the pleasure of their company and stay the night at his villa . " Would you happen to have a gun ? " Lacey asked now . " I have a hunting rifle . " " I mean , a pistol ? " " Yes , " he said after a moment . " I have one in my bedroom . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't be silly , " Hawkwood murmured . " I 'll lend it to you . " He smiled faintly . " I 'm sure it will be in good hands . " They walked up the path toward the house . It was a long path ; it ran for seventy or eighty yards , right up to the front door . It was lined with slim poplars , and the garden around it was lovingly landscaped with cypress trees , rose bushes , tall urns , and shaded benches . On the stretch of lawn in front of the house , Isabella was playing croquet with Richard and Hawkwood 's Russian masseur , David . Ivor , the mime , clad in immaculate whites , was sitting on the grass , his arms wrapped around his knees , watching . It was a charming picture , and Isabella was smiling happily , as if she were any untroubled suburban girl enjoying an idle pastime on an indolent weekend . As they approached , David was taking his turn . He smacked the wooden ball with his mallet and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Ah-hah ! " he cried out . " Goal ! " " Oh , God , " Richard moaned . He looked at Hawkwood and rolled his eyes upward in exasperation . David turned to Hawkwood triumphantly . " This gameis nothing ! " He smiled broadly , revealing wide gaps where teeth were missing . " First time I playalready I am winning . " " That 's marvelous , " Hawkwood said . " But you 'll have to learn the delicate touch . You could kill someone with that championship stroke of yours . " Isabella and Ivor laughed . Isabella , Lacey noticed , was focused on Hawkwood ; she had n't looked at him at all . Hawk-  | wood smiled back at her , gave Ivor a brief , tender look , then walked on . " David is n't used to summer games , " Hawkwood said to Lacey as they neared the front door . " He was a professional hockey player in the Soviet Union . Something of a star , I gather , with the Leningrad team . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his papers . He wants to emigrate to the States . He 's Jewish , " he explained . " Is it taking long ? " " These political things always do . He 's been in Rome three months now . " Hawkwood paused on the front step . " David is a fine masseur and trainer . I give him some money to live on and a place to stay . And , in exchange " he patted his flat stomach " he keeps me in shape . " He opened the door and they went in . In the hallway a man in a white serving jacket appeared . " La scconda colazionc e servita , Signor Hawkwood . " " Grazic , Emilio , " Hawkwood said . Emilio went outside to announce lunch to the others . " You are in for a treat , Alan , " Hawkwood said as they started up the stairway . " Emilio is a great cook . He should be the chef in a three-star restaurant . But do n't tell him I said that , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideas . " Hawkwood 's bedroom was plain , almost austere , with a large antique bedstead and , on the wall , framed photographs of handsome Anglo-Saxon-looking men and womenHawkwood 's family , Lacey assumed . Hawkwood pulled open a drawer of the dresser and took out an automatic , a Beretta .32 . " I bought this a year ago , " he said , " just in case . We 're quite isolated out here . " " I noticed , " Lacey said . When the taxi had let them out in front of the villa , he had seen that the high-walled property was surrounded by nothing but farmland . " Do n't you have any neighbors ? " he asked .  | " There 's an embassy up the road a way , but it closes down in the evening . On the other side , there 's a convent . A very reclusive one . Here , " he said , giving Lacey the Beretta , " I hope you do n't have to use this . " Lacey checked the magazine . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any more cartridges ? " he asked . Hawkwood took out a cartridge box , glanced inside , then handed it to Lacey . " There are only three left , " he said apologetically . " What happened to the rest ? " " I 've been doing some target practice . " " Oh ? Are you a good shot ? " " Pretty good . " Deferentially , Hawkwood added , " Though not as good as you , of course . " Lacey looked at him . " I have n't told you anything about myself , have I ? " " No , you have n't . " " But you seem to know . You seemed to know when I first met you . " Hawkwood shrugged . " Instinct , I suppose . Or maybe it 's in the blood , " he said with a little smile . " In the blood ? " " Come here and look . " Hawkwood led him over to the only framed picture that was n't a photograph . It was a reproduction of a Renaissance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cap and cloak , mounted on horseback , stiffly clutching a baton . " Sir John Hawkwood , as painted by Uccello , " Hawkwood said . " The original is in the Florence Cathedral . " " Hawkwood ? An ancestor of yours ? " " If only I could prove it , " he murmured wistfully . " I put a genealogist to work on it . He went back through three hundred years of South Carolina politicians and horse thieves , then lost the thread . " Lacey looked at the picture again . " What did this guy do ? "  | " He was the greatest of the condottieri . A master professional in the art of killing . A northern barbarian who was hired by people who thought themselves too civilized to commit their own butchery . " Hawkwood smiled . " As I said , Alan , it 's in the blood . I understood you the first time I saw you . We have an affinity . " Lacey was silent for a moment . Then quietly he said , " You do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Attribute that to modern decadence . Butwho knows ? " he shrugged humorously " there may be hope for me yet . " After lunch Lacey accepted David 's offer of a rubdown . They went to a room at the back of the house that had been converted into a small gym , complete with wall pulleys and tilted boards . Lacey took off his shirt and lay on his stomach on the rubbing table . Soon David 's strong , expert fingers were undoing the knots in his back and shoulders . " You are very tense , " David commented . " It 's been one of those weeks , " Lacey murmured . The blissful relaxation was creeping through him and he was already feeling drowsy . " Have you been in Boston ? " David asked . " Only briefly . " " Maybe you know Bobby Orr ? " " No . Who 's he ? " " Great hockey player . With Boston Bruins . He has been to Soviet Union . I have met him . " " Did you get along ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English then . " " You speak it pretty well now . " " I have been studying . Every day I read book in English . " After a moment he asked , " Have you read Mrs. ' Arris Goes to Paris by Paul Gallico ? " " No , I do n't think so . " " I am reading it now . " David let out his breath wearily .  | " Only sixty people in the world can understand that book . " " You 'll do fine once you 're in the States , " Lacey said . " Where do you plan to live ? " " I do not know . New York , maybe . Or Detroit . Wherever is good hockey team . " " You still play ? " " No , but I am great trainer . Is big decision , " he went on . " U.S. is big decision . " " I can imagine . " " In Soviet Union , man and wife argue all night . Do we go to Israel ? Israel is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Canada it rains all the time . We will need an umbrella . " He paused . When Lacey did n't react , he explained , " Anecdote . " Lacey laughed politely . David said nothing further for a few moments . " May I ask you something about U.S. ? " he asked suddenly . " Sure . What is it ? " " Are there many Negro gangsters in the U.S. ? " His tone was anxious now . " There are many black people , " Lacey said . " But they 're like any other people . Some are criminals , most are honest . " " Oh . " David sounded unconvinced . " The Negroes are all in the South ? " he asked hopefully . " None are in the North ? None in New York or Detroit ? " " They 're all over . Particularly in New York and Detroit . " David worked on him silently for a while . His hands were firm and confident , but behind them Lacey sensed an unease . At length he spoke up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Go ahead . " " In New York , where can I buy gun ? " " Why do you want to buy a gun ? " " To protect myself from the Negroes . " " Oh , Christ , " Lacey muttered . " Sorry , I ca n't help you . " " But you can tell me , yes ? " " Why do you expect me to know ? "  | " Because you are great gunman . " Lacey turned over onto his side and looked up at him . " Who told you that ? " David withdrew his hands , startled by the suddenness of Lacey 's reaction . " Emilio said it . He heard Mr. Hawkwood and Richard talk . He said you are great gunman and you run now from the Mafia . Is true ? " " No , it is n't true . " He sat up . " That 's enough . Thanks . " He reached for his shirt . He was disturbed , but after he left the gym he calmed down a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With a writer who loved to talk , and a house full of people , it had probably been too much to hope that their predicament could be kept secret . But no real harm had been done , after all . Winslade and Aziz were miles away in the city . In the morning Isabella and he would have their car and would be on their way to Tuscany . Even so , the awakened sense of danger lingered on . If nothing else , he had to warn Isabella to be on her guard . He encountered Richard by the stairway . " Where did Isabella go ? " Lacey asked . " She went upstairs with Ivor . " " Ivor ? " " She needed some lipstick , " Richard said with his catty little smile . Lacey went up to the second floor . " Isabella ? " he called out . " We are in here , Alan . " Isabella 's voice came from a nearby room . He went to the open doorway and looked in . He was puzzled by what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting at a dressing-table mirror . The girl had a mass of fluffy platinum-blonde hair and was wearing a low-cut black sheath dress . Ivor was executing deft strokes with an eyebrow pencil . " Where 's Isabella ? " Lacey asked . The girl swung around toward him and burst out laughing  | at his startled expression . It was Isabella . " Do I not look gorgeous ? " she asked . " Yeah , terrific . Like something out of an old movie . What 's going on ? " " I am trying on some of Ivor 's things . His dresshis wig they are so beautiful ! " " I did n't bring much with me , " Ivor said in his soft , hesitant voice . " Most of my costumes are back at the hotel . " " This dress " Isabella stroked herself wonderingly " it fits almost perfectly ! " Lacey noticed that the two of them did have a certain resemblance ; they seemed like young sisters playing with clothes and cosmetics . They were nearly the same height , equally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It looks much nicer on Isabella , " Ivor said . " She has the natural figure . I have to wear padding . " He gazed at her admiringly . " And she has such beautiful skin ! I just die when I see it ! " " You have nice skin too , Ivor , " she said . " I break out , " he murmured sadly . " I hate to interrupt , " Lacey said , " but I 'd like to talk with Isabella . " " We can talk later , " Isabella said , with an impatient wave of her hand . " First , I must show this to the others . " She rose , took a last delighted look at herself in the mirror , and hurried out . Lacey , finding himself suddenly alone with Ivor , was at a loss for anything to say . After a moment he asked , " Do you wear that outfit when you perform ? " " Sometimes , " Ivor replied . " When I 'm playing Jean Harlow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm a mime . It 's an art form , not a nightclub act . " He said it gently , not as a rebuke but as a point of information .  | " Oh , sure , I understand . " There was an awkward pause . " Well , " Lacey said , " I think I 'll see what the others are doing . " He started out . " No , Alan , please stay . " Lacey turned back . Ivor was gazing at him intently . " Let 's talk , " the boy said shyly . " All right . " Ivor smiled gratefully and sat at the edge of the narrow bed . Lacey pulled out the chair from the dressing table and sat facing him . " Have you always been a mime ? " he asked . " Only about a year . I went to Paris to study mime . Before that I was a dancer . " " Back home ? " Ivor nodded . " Seattle . " " It 's a big jump from Seattle to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had n't made that jump , I 'd be dead now . " " Oh , really ? " Lacey regarded him skeptically . " Who was going to kill you ? " " Me . " He held out his hands , showing the undersides of his wrists . Faint white scars traversed the veins . " I tried it twice . " ' With a flicker of a smile he added , " I was getting better at it . " " You 're a little young to be thinking that . " " I do n't intend ever to be old , " Ivor said in a matter-of-fact way . " But it was bad enough being born in Seattle . I decided I did n't want to die in Seattle . " " Yeah . Well , if you feel that way " Lacey glanced at the doorway , hoping Isabella might appear . " Do I get you nervous ? " Ivor asked , his voice soft and concerned . " A little . " " You really should n't be nervous with me . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't care if you were . " " But I 'm not . I 'm a woman in a man 's body . But I have  | no interest in sex . That 's why I can talk with you more easily than with Bill . He 's a nice man , but he 's " he hesitated delicately " sensual . " " Then why are you with him ? " Ivor smiled wanly . " We all need to be loved , do n't we ? " " Of course . And I 'm sure Hawkwood can understand you better than I. " " No , Alan . You can understand . You can understand because you 're kind . " Lacey looked at him uncertainly . " Have you heard anything about what I do ? " " Yes . And I think you 're a kind man . " He leaned forward slightly . " What you have to give can be the greatest kindness of all . " Ivor 's eyes held on him ; there was a tenderness and need in them that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so cruel to you ? " Lacey asked quietly . " People are always cruel , " Ivor said . " To the boys at school , I was some kind of freak . They ridiculed me . " His mouth tightened . " They ridiculed me in loud voices so that everyone could hear and know how manly they were . Then one or the other of them would get me alone and ask me to do some disgusting thing to himand would get angry when I refused . " He fell silent for a moment . In anguish , his beautiful face seemed still younger ; it had the baffled pain of a wounded child . " I was so miserable , " he went on , " I wanted to die . And I tried to . The second time , to make sure , I took a bottle of pills before slashing my wrists . I remember , just before I came to , I had a dream . " The pain vanished from his face and he focused on some point in the air before him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was night , " he said , his voice dropping to a whisper . " I was sleeping , and a man came , woke me , took me by the hand , and drew me out of the house into the garden . I looked down and saw that I was wearing a lovely long white dress . I looked around and the garden was n't  | my garden at all . There were strange trees and plants , and flowers I had never seen before . The man led me down a path , led me somewhere out into the dark , and suddenly " he smiled slowly , with serene joy " I felt very happy . " " Who was the man ? " Lacey asked . " I do n't know , " Ivor said . " I had never see him before . " His shining eyes turned toward him . " I think he looked a little like you , Alan . Yes , he looked like you . "  | After dinner , while they were having coffee in the sitting room , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy chairs , Hawkwood and Lacey on one side , Richard and David on the other ; Isabella was curled on a striped cushion on the tiled floor . Ivor stood before the fireplace , clad simply in a white T-shirt , white pants , and white sneakers , his shoulders squared , il his chest cage raised , poised on the balls of his feet . He mimed an elaborately dressed lady preparing for bed . First the scarf and hat came off , then the gloves , then the fur coat . The necklace and earrings were removed , the dress was pulled up over his head , the false eyelashes were painfully plucked off . He unfastened the bra , stepped out of the half-slip , then , in a protracted , body-contorting struggle , freed himself of the girdle . Every movement was exquisitely precise . After the first minute or so , Lacey no longer saw the flat-planed , hardmuscled boy , but rather a voluptuous , self-indulgent , narcissistic woman .  | From time to time Lacey sneaked a look at Isabella . She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the course of an afternoon she and Ivor had become great friends . She had spent most of her time with the boy and had talked to Lacey hardly at all . " God , is n't he beautiful ! " Hawkwood said softly as he gazed raptly at Ivor . " If I were an emperor and had the power to put a human being among the gods , that is what I would immortalize . I would want to put that beauty beyond the reach of age and death . " Richard snorted . Hawkwood looked across the coffee table at him . The secretary-companion was making a show of studying Ivor 's performance ; his lips were pursed , and behind the pink-rimmed glasses his eyes were hypercritical . Beside him , David was more genuinely watching the boy with fascination and perplexity . " Or do n't you think so , Richard ? " Hawkwood purred . " He may be a god , " Richard said , " but he 's no Marcel Marceau . " " Ivor is very good , " Isabella protested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said to her . " He 's just cranky because he had to make the espresso . " " Oh ? Where is Emilio ? " she asked . " We do n't know , " Hawkwood said . " He 's gone . " Lacey was instantly alert . " What do you mean , he 's gone ? " he asked . " Just that . After he served dinner , he disappeared . It probably does n't mean anything , " he went on . " Emilio has family all around here . I imagine some emergency came up . " Lacey got up and crossed to the phone . He picked up the receiver and held it to his ear . " What 's the matter ? " Hawkwood asked . " The phone 's dead , " Lacey said . " What ? " Hawkwood looked at him in puzzlement . " It was working an hour ago . "  | " Yeah . But someone has just cut the wire . " Ivor stopped . Suddenly everyone was staring at Lacey . " Turn off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Richard hesitated only a moment . Then he rose and crossed to a master switch , and in an instant the lights in the sitting room went off . They were left in semidarkness ; the moonlight that poured through the French doors created a dim glow in the room . Lacey went to the French doors and looked out . He saw Hawkwood 's Ferrari on the gravel beside the house , and , beyond it , the lawn and the garden . He had a clear view of the front path . At the very end of it , he could make out several shadowy figures standing in a group by the Roman tomb . The group came apart and the figures started up the path in single file . Lacey counted four men . The one in front was easily recognizable as Winslade ; he was almost a foot taller than any of the others . Hawkwood had joined him . " Who are they ? " he asked . Lacey did n't answer . He took the Beretta out of his pocket . " Stand back , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood clear of the French doors . Lacey turned to the others . " Everyone lie down on the floor . " They did so . Lacey opened a glass door a few inches , stuck the pistol out , fired a shot , then jumped to one side quickly . A volley of bullets , four or five in a two-second burst , tore through the French doors . The shattered glass cascaded to the tiled floor . It was silent again . There were no more shots ; there was no sound at all , in the garden or in the sitting room . " Did you hit one ? " Hawkwood asked . His deep voice was as calm as ever . " I was n't trying to , " Lacey replied . " Just letting them know I have a gun . Now they 'll hold off for a while . " He carefully peeked out past a fringe of jagged glass . The moonlit garden seemed deserted ; Winslade and his men were nowhere in sight .  | " I do n't understand , " Hawkwood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here ? " " All Emilio had to do was notify the local Mafiosi . " " Emilio ? " There was shock in Hawkwood 's voice . " That 's not possible ! Emilio is totally devoted to me . " " Yeah , but maybe now he has enough money to open his own restaurant . Did you say you had a hunting rifle ? " he asked . " Yes . Should I get it ? " " Please do . " Hawkwood hurried out of the room . Lacey remained by the shattered French doors , his pistol poised , ready to react to any sudden movement in the garden . " What is happening , please ? " David asked . " There are some men out there who want to kill Isabella and me , " Lacey said . " The Mafia ? You said it was not true , " David said accusingly . " It 's not the Mafia that wants it . It 's the Arabs . " " Arabs ! " David seemed suddenly excited . He rose to his feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sorry , " Lacey said . " This is the only one I have . " " I am great sharpshooter , " David insisted . " Was very best in Red Army . " " That 's terrific . If I need you , I 'll tell you . Now , get down again . " Hawkwood returned with the rifle , a Beretta 30.06 . Lacey posted him by the French doors , then went to the kitchen at the rear of the house . It was a large kitchen with several windows and a back door that opened out to a small meadow behind the house . He went to one of the windows and looked out . Beyond the meadow was a cypress grove . Two men were standing by the trunk of the nearest tree . They were making no particular attempt to conceal themselves ; the taller of the  | two , a man in a light gray hat , was nonchalantly lighting a cigarette . Lacey looked to both sides , checking out the physical situation . Off to the left , twenty yards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beside it was a car he had n't noticed before , a Fiat Spider . He could see that it was blocked off from the view of the lookouts in the cypress grove . A few yards past the shed , a low wooden fence marked the boundary of Hawkwood 's property . Nothing was visible in the pasture beyond , but somewhere in the darkness a sleepless sheep bleated wearily . He went back up front . In the darkened sitting room , Hawkwood was on one knee by the French doors , the rifle cradled in his arms . The others were on the floor in the middle of the room , sitting up against the fronts of the easy chairs . " Seen anything out there ? " Lacey asked Hawkwood . " No , " Hawkwood said . " There 's been no sign of them . " " Okay , David , " Lacey said , turning to the Russian . " Yes ? " David rose eagerly . " Take Mr. Hawkwood 's rifle and guard the rear . There are two men standing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just keep an eye on them . If any more men come up behind the house , give me a shout . " David crossed briskly to Hawkwood and took the rifle from him . He gave the barrel an affectionate stroke , then hurried out . " What will we do now ? " Isabella asked . " I do n't know , " Lacey admitted . He felt a heaviness in his head , a slow-witted helplessness . Isabella and Ivor , sitting side by side on the floor , were looking up at him hopefully , as if they expected him to have some ready solution . And he did n't know any . All he knew was that in a few minutes they were likely to be dead , every one of them . He joined Hawkwood by the French doors . " Isabella and I ca n't stay here , " he said . " It 's not fair to you . You were kind  | enough to take us in . I do n't want you and your friends to be hurt . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Ca n't we hold them off ? " " I have only nine rounds left . After that , it 's one rifle against six guns . Anyway " He broke off without uttering his thought . But he knew that they would n't even have the chance of an unequal gunfight . Winslade was no amateur , and the lull in the attack was ominous . It meant that Winslade was preparing some other kind of assault , with sticks of dynamite , perhaps , or a gasoline bomb . Fire . That 's what he would do in Winslade 's place . It would be the surest way to flush them out . " Whose car is that out in back ? " he asked . " The Spider ? It 's ours , " Hawkwood said . " Richard uses it when I 'm using the Ferrari . " " It 's in running order and has gas ? " " Of course . You think you can get away in it ? " " I do n't know , " Lacey said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Through the sheep pasture . You 'd have to drive through the fence . But it 's old and flimsy . " Lacey thought for a moment . " We ca n't risk it . Not with those two guys on the lookout back there . " He paused uncertainly . " If only we could create some kind of diversion " He looked out at the garden again . Drenched in moonlight , the fussily landscaped expanse seemed oddly artificial ; it might have been a stage set , with papier mache urns and trees . He was reminded of the last act of the opera he had seen : the isolated inn and , lurking outside it , the vengeful hunchback waiting for his slaughtered victim . Something started to connect in his mind . He focused on it . Sparafucile . The girl in a man 's cloak . He turned and looked at Ivor and Isabella . They were hold-  | ing hands to comfort each other , two lovely kindred creatures . " I have an idea , " Lacey said . Lacey walked slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's length . His finger was on the trigger and he was sighting along the barrel at Winslade 's heart . Winslade came toward him at the same pace ; he too had his Walther extended in the firing position . " That 's far enough , " Winslade said , stopping . Lacey halted . They were ten feet apart . The pistols were motionless in the air between them , steady on their targets . Winslade had readily agreed to Lacey 's shouted request for a talk . But it was the guns , set at hair-trigger adjustments and aimed at each other 's hearts , that enforced the truce . " What 's on your mind , old chum ? " Winslade asked . " I want to make a deal with you . " " Well , now , I 'm delighted to hear that . Come to your senses ? " Winslade 's companions had kept out of sight . But now , as Lacey looked past the South African , he saw a little man in a light-colored suit emerge from behind the Roman tomb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the path , clutching an automatic , watching them worriedly . " This is getting too messy , " Lacey said . " You 'd have to kill everyone in the house . It 's not the way we do things . " " I do n't like it , " Winslade said . " But are you giving me any alternative ? " " Yes . I 'll give you the girl . " " Well , good . " Winslade seemed surprised , then cautious . He eyed Lacey warily . " What do you want in exchange ? " " My safety . And the safety of the others . " Winslade nodded slowly . " I think that can be arranged . " " But there 's one condition . " " What ? " " The girl is not to be hurt . "  | Winslade looked unhappy . " Sorry , old chum . I have my orders . " " You can modify them , ca n't you ? Take her prisoner . Take her to any Arab country you want . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story . " " I do n't know " " You think it would be better the other way ? We 've got some crack shots in the house . " Winslade 's eyes shifted as they quickly scanned the front windows . " You have what you 're holding , " he said . " And one rifle . " Emilio had obviously briefed him well . " But it would be messy , " Lacey said . " Yes , " Winslade agreed . " Messy . " " This way , you carry it off clean . No more blood spilled . And you 'll have the person you want . " Winslade thought for a few moments . " All right , " he said finally . " It 's a deal . " " What about our Arab friend ? " Lacey asked , glancing at Aziz . " Will he agree ? " " He 'll have to . I 'm in charge of this operation . " " Then I have your word ? " " The girl wo n't be hurt . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is none of my business . " He regarded Lacey quizzically . " You 've been pretty desperate to save this girl . What brings about the change of heart ? " " I got to thinking , " Lacey said . " And I realized I had responsibilities . " " Such as ? " " I have a family . A wife and two kids . " Winslade nodded . " I remember . " " My wife phoned the other day . She had some bad news . My little boy has a spot on his lung . Could be TB . " " Oh , I 'm sorry . " Winslade 's hawk face softened with concern . " How old is he ? " " Seven . "  | " Rotten luck . It 's that godawful climate . " " I know . " " You have a good doctor ? " " Well , we live in a village . " " The local G.P. , eh ? " Winslade pondered for a moment . " Look , Lacey , " he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miracle worker . He cured a friend of mine when everyone else had given up on her . " " Where is he ? " " In London . Harley Street . Dr. John Carlisle . You can look him up in the directory . " Lacey 's arm was aching from holding out the pistol , but he paused to memorize the doctor 's name . " LYLE ? " he asked . " LISLE , " Winslade corrected . " Thanks . I 'll remember that . " His gun arm was trembling . Winslade 's Walther , too , was swaying . " Well , I guess that 's it . You 'll give me some time , wo n't you ? I have to persuade the girl . " " I 'll give you half an hour . If you do n't bring the girl out by then , the deal 's off . " " Fair enough . " There was a brief silence , then Winslade smiled his easy , friendly smile . " I 'm glad we 've worked this out , Lacey . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lunatics . " " I know . " Lacey took a step back ; Winslade did the same . They retreated carefully from each other to the opposite ends of the path . When Lacey entered the upstairs room , Ivor was sitting in front of the dressing table snipping away at the dark wig , his scissors clacking rapidly and expertly . He held up the wig beside Isabella 's head and compared it with her hairdo . " Close , " Ivor said . " But not half as lovely as the original . "  | " You are sweet , " Isabella murmured . She looked up at Lacev . " It is not the exact color , " she said . " Is it all right ? " " It does n't matter , " Lacey said . " He 'll be wearing a scarf over his head . " The scissors clacked again as Ivor executed the perfecting touches . He smiled as he worked ; he seemed to be enjoying himself . When he was finished , he displayed the shorn , shaped wig . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " there went my Liz Taylor . Now I 'll have to learn how to do Liza Minnelli . " Ivor pinned up his ponytail with two bobby pins . Then he slipped on the wig , swung around to face the mirror , and went to work with a comb and some wave set , fixing the gamine strands in place . He had already made up his face ; his cheeks were rouged , and the lipstick was laid thick on his lips and was cleanly outlined with pencil . He had created a close approximation of Isabella 's full , red mouth . When he was through , Isabella and Lacey leaned forward and studied the image in the mirror . It was n't a precise likeness , but the resemblance was very strong , good enough , certainly , to fool strangers in dim moonlight . " Beautiful , " Isabella said . " Very good , " Lacey said . " It is nice , is n't it ? " Ivor said , pleased . " I 'm going back down , " Lacey said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few minutes left . " He went downstairs . The sitting room was still dark , and Hawkwood was standing guard by the shattered French doors . Lacey had left the automatic with him , and the writer had the pistol poised professionally at shoulder height . Richard was sitting in an easy chair , looking down at the floor rather sullenly . He had spoken only once since the siege had started , when he had agreed to drive the Fiat Spider . Lacey went to Hawkwood and recovered the pistol . He glanced out at the garden . No one was in view . " Are they ready ? " Hawkwood asked .  | " Just about . " Lacey glanced at his watch . Twenty-eight minutes had gone by since his talk with Winslade . He edged up to the glassless frame and shouted , " Winslade ! Can you hear me ? " Winslade 's voice , distant but clear , came from the other end of the garden . " I hear you . " " It 's all set , " Lacey shouted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He waited , but there was no response . " Okay , Richard , " Lacey said , turning . Richard rose . He reached into his pants pocket , took out the car keys , and held them out . " I 'm not going . " " What do you mean , you 're not going ? " " I 've been with Bill for eighteen years , " Richard said . " I 'm not leaving him now . " Hawkwood was gazing at Richard intently , almost bemusedly , and his faint smile for once had no mockery in it . " Richard , " he began gently , " you do n't have to " " Do n't argue with me , Bill ! " Richard snapped testily . " I 've made up my mind . I 'm staying . " Hawkwood turned to Lacey . " David can drive the car , then . " Lacey nodded , crossed to Richard , took the car keys , and left the room . He went to the back of the house , to the kitchen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the rifle butt against his shoulder , the barrel resting on the sill . Lacey peered out of the window at the cypress grove . The two lookouts were nowhere in sight . " Where did they go ? " he asked . " A man came , " David said . " Then all went back together . " Lacey felt a quiet satisfaction . Winslade had bought it . The chances for Isabella 's escape were suddenly very good . " That 's a break , " he said . " It will make it easier for you . " " Me ? " David looked up at him in puzzlement .  | " Yes . There 's been a change in plans . You 're going with Isabella now . Are you a good driver ? " " I am great driver , " David said . " Fine . If you do n't know the roads , Isabella will guide you . " He heard footsteps on the stairs . He went back into the main hall . Isabella and Ivor were coming down . Isabella @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ivor was dressed in Isabella 's blue blouse and print skirt . He had a white scarf wrapped around his wigged head , and he was carrying a tan raincoat . As the two of them paused on the bottom step , Lacey had a moment of confused split vision . The blonde-wigged figure was garish and unfamiliar , while Isabella seemed still to be residing in her clothes ; Ivor had captured the exact tilt of her head , the light grace of her posture . Lacey hesitated an instant before taking the blonde-wigged girl 's hand . " Come on , " he said to her . " We do n't have much time . " " But I must say goodbye , " Isabella said , looking toward the sitting room . " There 's no time for that , " Lacey insisted . " It 's clear back there now . You have to get away while you can . " Isabella swiftly kissed Ivor on the cheek . Lacey led her down the hall to the kitchen . David was waiting beside the back door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him the car keys . " Now listen carefully , " he said . " Keep an eye on your watch . When I say go , ' you and Isabella scoot out this door and get into the car . Put in the ignition key , but do n't turn on the lights . One minute after I say go , ' Ivor and I will start out the front door . Wait thirty seconds , then start the car , drive through the fence and get out of here . " He went over it again slowly . " Goget into the cara minute after go , ' start counting to thirtythen drive . Understand ? " David nodded . " Yes . " Lacey shook his hand . " Good luck . "  | He turned to Isabella . She was gazing up at him uncertainly . " Thank you , " she said softly . She smiled hesitantly . " I hope you get home safely to your wife . " As he looked at her , he realized he felt nothing , only a certain awkwardness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he should be dying for someone he scarcely knew , a blonde-wigged stranger . She kissed him lightly on the lips . He held the kiss for one moment , then stepped back and looked at his watch . He waited for the minute hand to ease onto the mark . David was looking at his watch too . " Go , " Lacey said . David opened the door , and he and Isabella ran across to the Fiat Spider . Lacey waited tensely , but there were no gunshots , no shouts . David opened the car door . Isabella got in , then David followed and closed the door noiselessly after them . Lacey ran back to the sitting room . Hawkwood , Richard , and Ivor were standing together by the French doors . Lacey gave Hawkwood the rifle . " Cover us , " he said . He took Ivor 's arm . " Come on . " Hawkwood put a restraining hand on Ivor 's shoulder and looked at him with concern . " You 're sure he 'll be all right ? " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Lacey said . " We 'll just have to do some fast talking when they find out . And you 'll be all right , too , once they realize Isabella has gotten away . " " What about you ? " Hawkwood asked . Lacey did n't answer . He looked at his watch again . Eighteen seconds left . He drew Ivor away . They hurried out of the room , went into the entrance hall , and stopped by the front doter . He glanced at his watch one last time . Ten seconds left . He drew the Beretta out of his pocket , took the raincoat from Ivor , and draped it over his gunhand , concealing the pistol . He gripped the doorknob.  | " Wait , " Ivor said . He put his hand to his chest , took a deep breath , and swallowed . " I always get stage fright , " he said with an apologetic smile . " All right , " he whispered . Lacey opened the door and they started out . They walked down the path @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his arm . At the far end , gathered in front of the Roman tomb , six men stood waiting . Winslade and Aziz were in the center by the opening to the burial chamber . The man in the gray hat and his partner were off to the left , the other two men to the right . The garden was silent except for the sound of their footsteps on the gravel and the rustle of the breeze in the cypress trees . The scent of roses was in the air , mingled with another fragrance , musky and familiar . After a moment Lacey recognized itIsabella 's perfume . He glanced at the slim figure beside him . Ivor 's eyes were downcast . His hips within the skirt were swaying slightly as he gracefully mimicked the walk of a young girl . When they neared the end of the path , Aziz took a couple of steps forward and looked intently at Ivor . Lacey heard a snapping of wood in the distance , the crack of a fence breaking . Two of the men turned their heads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his lips parted with excitement . They came to a stop . Aziz took an automatic out of his coat pocket , thrust it at Ivor , and fired three times . His third shot was followed instantly by the crack of a rifle . Aziz clutched his chest . Lacey swung his hand up , with the raincoat still draped on it , and fired one shot at Vinslade . The Walther spun crazily in the air . Winslade toppled backward . Tossing the raincoat aside , Lacey dropped into a crouch . But the other men remained very still . None of them went for his gun . The man in the gray hat shifted his feet uneasily . Lacey waited a few seconds , then straightened up slowly . He looked down at the bodies . Ivor was at his feet , a large
