// A Comparison Between the Americans and the Russians There are at the present time two great nations in the world which started from different points but seem to tend towards the same end . I allude to the Russians and the Americans . Both of them have grown up unnoticed ; and while the attention of mankind was directed elsewhere , they have suddenly placed themselves in the front rank among nations . All other nations seem to have nearly reached their natural limits , and they have only to main  --  tain their power . These two alone are still in the act of growth ; they are proceeding with ease and celerity along a path to which no limit can be perceived . The American struggles against the obstacles of nature ; the adversaries of the Rus  --  sians are men . The former combats the wilder  --  ness and savage life ? the latter , civilization with all its arms . The conquests of the Americans are therefore gained by the plowshare ; those of the Russian by the sword . The Anglo-American relies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scope to the unguided strength and common sense of the people ; the Russian centers all the authority of society in a single arm . The principal instrument of the former is freedom ? of the latter , servitude . Their starting point is different and their courses are not the same ; yet each of them seems marked out by the will of Heaven to sway the destinies of half the globe . How Americans Understand the Equality of Sexes Democracy destroys or modifies the different inequalities which originate in society ; but is this all ? Or does it not also ultimately affect that great inequality of man and woman which has seemed , up to the present day , to be eternally based in human nature ? I believe that the democratic changes which bring nearer to the same level the father and son , the master and servant , and superiors and infe  --  riors ? generally speaking ? will raise woman and make her more and more the equal of man . There are people in Europe , who , confound  --  ing together the different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman beings not only equal but alike . They would give to both the same functions , impose on both the same duties , and grant to both the same rights ; they would mix them in all things ? their occupations , their pleasures and their business . But it may readily be conceived that by thus attempting to make one sex equal to the other , both are de  --  graded ; and from so preposterous a medley of the works of nature , nothing could ever result but weak men and disorderly women . It is not thus that the Americans understand the species of democratic equality which may be established between the sexes . They admit thatsince nature has appointed such wide differences between the physical and moral constitution of man and woman , her manifest design was to give a distinct employment to their various faculties , getting each of them to fulfil their respective tasks in the best possible manner . The Americans have applied to the sexes their great principle of economics by carefully dividing the duties of man from those of women in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better carried on . In no country has such constant care been taken to trace two clearly distinct lines of action for the two sexes , and at the same time to make them keep pace with one another . American women never manage the outward concerns of a family , conduct a business , or take part in political life . Nor are they , on the other hand , ever compelled to perform the rough labor of the fields or to make any of those laborious exer  --  tions which demand physical strength . The Americans do not think that man and woman have either the duty or the right to per  --  form the same offices , but they show an equal regard for both their respective parts ; and . though their lot is different , they consider them both as beings of equal value . If they hold that a man and his partner ought not always to exercise their intellect and understanding in the same manner , they at least believe the understanding of the one to be as sound as the other and her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have allowed the social inferiority of woman to subsist. they have done all they could to raise her morally and intellectu  --  ally to the level of man ; and in this respect they appear to me to have excellently understood the true principle of democratic involvement . I do not hesitate to avow , that although the women of the United States are confined within the narrow circle of domestic life , and though their situation is in some respects one of extreme dependence , I have nowhere seen woman oc  --  cupying a loftier position ; and if I were asked to what the singular prosperity and growing strength of the Americans ought mainly to be attributed , I should reply ? to the superiority of their women . I know not if a single trading nation can be cited , from the Tyrians down to the Florentines and the English , who were not also a free people . There is a close bond and a necessary relation between these two elements ? freedom and pro  --  ductive industry . Freedom is especially favorable to the production of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is especially adverse to the same result . The nature of despotic power in democratic Continued on page 116 THE NEW AMERICAN continued from page 75 ages is not to be fierce or cruel , but minute and meddling . Despotism of this kind , though it does not trample on humanity , is directly opposed to the genius of commerce and the pur  --  suits of industry . Thus , men of dem  --  ocratic ages require to be free in order to more readily procure those physical enjoyments for which they are always longing . Perhaps there is no country in the world where fewer idle men are to be met with than in America , or where all who work are more eager to promote their own welfare . The Americans believe their free  --  dom to be the best instrument and surest safeguard of their welfare . Further , they believe that their chief business is to secure for themselves a government which will allow them to acquire the things they covet , and which will not debar them from the peaceful enjoyment of those posses  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peace While Their Armies Desire War I think it may be admitted as a general and constant rule that , amongst civilized nations , the war  --  like passions will become more rare and less intense in proportion as the social conditions become more equal . The ever-increasing numbers of men of property , the growth of personal wealth ( which war so rap  --  idly consumes ) and the tendencies to pity which are engendered by the equality of conditions ? all these causes concur to quench the military spirit . War is nevertheless an occur  --  rence to which all nations are sub  --  ject , democratic as well as others . Whatever taste they may have for peace , they must hold themselves in readiness to repel aggression ? or , in other words , they must have an army . Amongst aristocratic nations , especially those in which birth is the only source of rank , the same inequality exists in the army as in the nation : the officer is noble , the soldier is a serf . The private sol  --  dier 's ambition is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same manner , a nobleman who embraces the profession of arms follows it less from motives of ambition than from a sense of duties imposed upon him by his birth . In democratic armies , all soldiers may become officers , which makes the desire for promotion general and immeasurably extends the bounds of military ambition . The officer sees nothing which necessar ? ily stops him at one grade more than another ; and each grade has immense importance in his eyes be  --  cause his rank in society almost al  --  ways depends on his rank in the army . Amongst democratic armies , it often happens that an officer has no property but his pay , and no distinction but that of military hon  --  ours . Consequently , as often as his duties change , his fortune changes ; and he becomes , as it were , a new man . All the ambitious spirits of a democratic army are therefore ar  --  dently desirous of war because war makes vacancies and warrants the violation of that law of seniority which is the sole privilege natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ par  --  adox : that of all armies , those most ardently desirous of war are dem  --  ocratic armies ? while of all peo  --  ples , those most deeply attached to peace are democratic nations . What makes this contradiction still more extraordinary is that these effects are both caused at the same time by the principle of equality . I foresee that there are two things which a democratic people will always find very difficult : to begin a war and to end it . This spirit is a condition inher  --  ent in the very constitution of dem  --  ocratic armies and beyond hope of cure . It is in the nation , not in the army itself , where one must look for the remedy for the excesses of the army . The United States of America has only been emancipated for half a century from the state of colonial dependence . Yet no people in the world has made such rapid progress in trade and manufactures as the Americans . They constitute at the present day the second maritime nation in the world ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impediments , they are not pre  --  vented from making great and daily advances . America is a land of wonders in which everything is in constant motion and every change seems an advancement . The idea of novelty is indissolubly connected with that of improvement . No natural boundary seems to be set to the efforts of man ; and in his eyes what is not yet done is only what he has not yet attempted to do . This perpetual change which goes on in the United States , these frequent vicissitudes of fortune and unforeseen fluctuations in private and public wealth , serve to keep the minds of the people in a perpetual and feverish agitation , which admi  --  rably invigorates their exertions and keeps them above the ordinary level of humanity . The whole life of an American is passed like a game of chance , a revolutionary crisis , or a battle . As the same causes are con  --  tinually in operation throughout the country , they ultimately impart an irresistible impulse to the nation  --  al character . To evade the bondage of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means of information , to seek the reason of things for oneself and in oneself alone , to tend to results without being bound to means , and to aim at the substance through the form ? such are the principal char  --  acteristics of what I shall call the philosophical method of the Ameri  --  cans . They have no rooted habits and they easily shake off the influence that the habits of other nations might exercise upon them , from a conviction that their country is un  --  like any other , and that its situation is without a precedent in the world . The American , taken as a chance specimen of his countrymen , must therefore be a man of singular warmth in his desires , enterprising , fond of adventure , and above all , of novelty . This same bent is manifest in all he does . He introduces it into his polit  --  ical laws , his religious doctrines , his theories of social economy , and his domestic occupations . He bears it with him in the depths of the back  --  woods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is this same passion ap  --  plied to maritime commerce that makes him the quickest trader in the world . In the United States great under  --  takings and speculations are exe  --  cuted without difficulty , because the whole population is engaged in productive industry and because the poorest as well as the most opu  --  lent members of the common  --  wealth are ready to combine their efforts for these purposes . Every  --  body works and work opens a way to everything . The consequence is that a stranger is constantly amazed by the immense public works exe  --  cuted by a nation which contains , so to speak , no rich men . They have joined the Hudson to the Missis  --  sippi and have made the Atlantic Ocean communicate with the Gulf of Mexico across a continent of more than five hundred leagues which separates the two seas . ( The longest railroads which have been constructed up to the present time are in America . ) Thus , Americans , who arrived but as yesterday on the territory they inhabit , have already changed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That the Americans Are Greedy for Praise All free nations are vainglorious , but national pride is not displayed by all in the same manner . The Americans in their intercourse with strangers appear impatient of the smallest censure and insatiable of praise . The most slender eulogium is acceptable to them ; the most ex  --  alted seldom contents them . They unceasingly harass you to extort praise , and if you resist their en  --  treaties they fall to praising them  --  selves . It would seem as if , doubting their own merit , they wished to have it constantly exhibited before their eyes . Their vanity is not only greedy . but restless and jealous ; it will grant nothing , whilst it de  --  mands everything . If I say to an American that the country he lives in is a fine one , " Ay , " he replies , " there is not its fellow in the world . " If I applaud the freedom which its inhabitants enjoy , he answers , " Freedom is a fine thing , but few nations are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purity of morals which distin  --  guishes the United States , " I can imagine , " says he , " that a stranger , who has been struck by the cor  --  ruption of all other nations , is astonished at the difference . " At length , I leave him to the contem  --  plation of himself , but he returns to the charge and does not desist till he has got me to repeat all I had just been saying . It is impossible to conceive a more troublesome or more garrulous patriotism ; it wearies even those who are dis  --  posed to respect it . Why It 's Difficult To Insult an American The social conditions of the Americans naturally accustom them not to take offense in small mat  --  ters . Despising no one on account of his station , he does not imagine that any one can despise him for that cause ; and until he has clearly perceived an insult , he does not suppose that an affront was in-tended . I have often remarked in the United States that it is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be dispensed with : hints will not always suffice to shake him off . I contradict an American at every word he says ( to show him that his conversation bores me ) , and he instantly labors with fresh pertinacity to convince me . I preserve a dogged silence and he thinks I am meditating deeply on the truths which he is uttering . At last I rush from his company , and he supposes that some urgent business hurries me elsewhere . This man will never understand that he wearies me to extinction unless I tell him so , and the only way to get rid of him is to risk making him my enemy for life . Why the Americans Are Open and Friendly While Englishmen Are Cold and Constrained In a foreign country two Ameri  --  cans are at once friends , simply be  --  cause they are Americans . They are repulsed by no prejudice and are at  --  tracted by their common country . For two Englishmen , the same blood is not enough ; they must be brought together by the same rank . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where they are surrounded by strangers whose language and manners are almost un  --  known to them , they will first stare at each other with much curiosity and a kind of secret uneasiness . They will then turn away , or , if one ac  --  costs the other , they will take care to converse only with a constrained and absent air upon very unimpor  --  tant subjects . Unable to judge at once the social position of those he meets , an Englishman prudently avoids all contact with them . In America , where the privileges of birth never existed and where riches confer no peculiar rights on their possessors , men unacquainted with each other are very ready to frequent the same places , and find neither peril nor advantage in the free interchange of their thoughts . If they meet by accident , they neither seek nor avoid intercourse ; their manner is therefore natural , frank , and open ; it is easy to see that they hardly expect or appre  --  hend anything from each other , and that they do not care to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the world . If their de  --  meanor is often cold and serious , it is never haughty or constrained ; and if they do not converse , it is because they are not in a humor to talk ? not because they think it is in their interest to be silent . Of the Taste for Physical Well-Being of America In aristocratic communities , the wealthy , never having experienced a condition different from their own , entertain no fear of changing it . To them , the comforts are not the end of life , but simply a way of living ; they regard them as existence it  --  self ? enjoyed but scarcely thought of . Hence , it is , that in the midst of physical gratifications , the members of an aristocracy often display a haughty contempt of these very en  --  joyments . The people , in the end , get as much accustomed to their poverty as the rich to their opulence , The latter bestow no anxiety on their physical comforts because they en  --  joy them without effort ; the former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and which they hardly know enough of to desire . On the contrary , when the dis  --  tinctions of rank are confounded together and privileges are destroy  --  ed , and when education and free  --  dom are diffused , the desire of ac  --  quiring the comforts of the world haunts the imagination of the poor and the dread of losing them that of the rich . I never met in America with any citizen so poor as to not cast a glance of hope and envy on the en  --  joyments of the rich , or whose imagination did not possess itself , by anticipation , of those good things which fate still obstinately withheld from him . Furthermore , I never perceived amongst the wealthier inhabitants of the United States that proud contempt of physical gratifications which is sometimes to be met with even in the most opulent and disso  --  lute aristocracies . Most of these wealthy persons were once poor and have felt the sting of want . They were long prey to adverse for  --  tunes , and now that the victory is won @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ survived it . Their minds are , as it were , still in  --  toxicated by the small enjoyments which they have pursued for so many years . The American in Europe An American leaves his country with a heart swollen with pride . On arriving in Europe , he at once finds out that we are not so engrossed by the United States and the great peo  --  ple which inhabit them as he had supposed , and this begins to annoy him . He has been informed that the conditions of society are not equal in our part of the globe , and he ob  --  serves that among the nations of Europe , the traces of rank are not wholly obliterated and that wealth and birth still retain some indeter  --  minate privileges . Profoundly igno  --  rant of the place which he ought to occupy in this half-ruined scale of classes , he is afraid of ranging him  --  self too high and still more is afraid of being ranged too low . This two  --  fold peril keeps his mind constantly on the stretch and embarrasses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ar  --  rives in Europe , his first care is to surround himself with all the luxu  --  ries of wealth . He is so afraid of being taken for the plain citizen of a democracy that he adopts a hun  --  dred distorted ways of bringing some new instance of his wealth be  --  fore you every day . His house will be in the most fashionable part of the town ; he will always be sur  --  rounded by a host of servants I have heard an American complain that in the best houses of Paris the society was rather mixed ; and he ventured to hint that , in his opin  --  ion , there was a want of elegance of manner . He is full of scruples and at the same time of pretensions . He wishes to do enough but fears to do too Continued on page 122 continued from page 117 much , and as he does not very well know the limits of the one or of the other , he keeps up a haughty and embarrassed air of reserve . Why the Quality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a country where I find some of the finest produc  --  tions of the arts , I learn from this fact nothing of the social condition or of the political constitution of the country . But if I perceive that the productions of the arts are gen  --  erally of an inferior quality , very abundant and very cheap , I am con  --  vinced that amongst the people where this occurs , privilege is on the decline and that ranks . are be  --  ginning to intermingle and will soon be confounded together . In aristocracies , the handicrafts  --  men work for only a limited num  --  ber of very fastidious customers , and the profit they hope to make depends principally on the perfec  --  tion of their workmanship . Such is no longer the case when , as in America , all privileges are abolished , ranks are intermingled , and men are forever rising or sink  --  ing upon the ladder of society . There are always a large number of men whose desires grow much faster than their fortunes and who gloat upon the gifts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means to command them . Such men are eager to find some shortcut to these gratifications . The result is that in democracies there are al  --  ways a multitude of individuals who are very willing to accept im  --  perfection rather than abandon the object of their desires . The artisan readily understands these passions , for he himself par  --  takes in them . In an aristocracy he would seek to sell his workmanship at a high price to the few ; he now conceives that the more expeditious way of getting rich is to sell them at a low price to all . But there are only two ways of lowering the price of commodities : the first is to dis  --  cover some better , shorter , and more ingenious method of produc  --  ing them : the second is to manufac  --  ture a larger quantity of goods , nearly similar , but of less value . Amongst a democratic popula  --  tion , all the intellectual faculties of the workman are directed to these two objects . He strives to invent methods which may enable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheaper ; or ( if he can not suc  --  ceed in that ) to diminish the intrin  --  sic qualities of the thing he makes without rendering it wholly unfit for the use for which it is intended . The handicraftsmen of demo  --  cratic ages endeavor not only to bring their useful productions with  --  in the reach of the whole communi  --  ty , but they strive to give to all their commodities attractive quali  --  ties which they do not in reality possess . When none but the wealthy had watches , they were almost all very good ones . Few are now made which are worth much , but every  --  body has one in his pocket . Thus , the democratic principle not only tends to direct the human mind to the useful arts , but it in  --  duces the artisan to produce with great rapidity a quantity of imper  --  fect commodities , and the con  --  sumer to content himself with these commodities . Not that in democracies the arts are incapable of producing very commendable works , if such be re @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if customers appear who are ready to pay for the time and trouble . But craftsmen have rarely an opportunity of displaying what they can do , and are scrupulously sparing of their powers . Although very capable of shooting beyond the mark before them , they aim only at what they can easily hit , thereby maintaining a state of ac  --  complished mediocrity . Long before an American girl ar  --  rives at the age of marriage , her emancipation from maternal con  --  trol begins . She has scarcely ceased to be a child , when she already thinks for herself , speaks with free  --  dom , and acts on her own impulse . The great scene of the world is con  --  stantly open to her view . Every day it is disclosed to her more com  --  pletely , and she is taught to survey it with a firm and calm gaze . Thus the vices and dangers of society are early revealed to her . As she sees them clearly , she views them with  --  out illusions and braves them with  --  out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own strength and this reli ance seems to be shared by all who are about her . I have been frequently surprised , and almost frightened at the singu  --  lar address and happy boldness with which young women in America contrive to manage their thoughts and their language amidst all the difficulties of stimulating conversa  --  tion ; a philosopher would have stumbled at every step along the narrow path which they trod with  --  out accidents and without effort . It is easy indeed to perceive that , even amidst the independence of early youth , an American woman is al  --  ways mistress of herself . She in  --  dulges in all permitted pleasures , without yielding herself up to any of them ; and her reason never al  --  lows the reins of self-guidance to drop , though it often seems to hold hem loosely . In France , where there is still such a strange mixture of thoughts , tastes and relics of all ages , we often give girls a timid , withdrawn , and almost cloistered education , as was done under aristocracy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the disorder insepar  --  able from democratic society . The Americans are more consis  --  tent . Believing that they had little chance of repressing in woman the most vehement passions of the human heart , they held that the surer way was to teach her the art of combating those passions for herself . As they could not prevent her virtue from being exposed to frequent danger , they determined that she should know how best to defend it ; and more reliance was placed on the free vigor of her will than on safeguards which have been shaken or overthrown , Instead then of inculcating mistrust of herself . they constantly seek to enhance her confidence in her own strength of character . As it is neither possible nor desirable to keep a young woman in perpetual and complete ignorance , they hasten to give her a precocious knowledge on all subjects . Far from hiding the corruptions of the world from her , they prefer that she should see them at once and train herself to shun them . They hold it of more importance to protect her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amongst aristocratic nations , birth and fortune frequently make two such different beings of man and woman that they can never be united to each other . Though their passions draw them together , the conditions of society prevent them from contracting a permanent and ostensible tie . The necessary conse  --  quence is a great number of tran  --  sient and clandestine connections as nature secretly avenges herself for the constraint imposed upon her by the laws of man . This is not so much the case when the equality of a democracy has swept away all the imaginary or the real barriers which separated man from woman . No girl then be  --  lieves that she can not become the wife of the man who loves her , and this renders all breaches of morality before marriage very uncommon ; for , whatever be the credulity of the passions , a woman will hardly be able to persuade herself that she is beloved , when her lover is per  --  fectly free to marry her and does not . Nothing better serves to justify an illicit passion , either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the world which looks on , than compulsory or contrived mar  --  riages . In a country ( as America ) in which a woman is always free to exercise her power of choosing , and in which education has prepared her to choose rightly , public opin  --  ion is inexorable to her faults . What Americans Like To Read and Why In democracies , most of those who have a tinge of belles lettres are either engaged in politics or in a profession which only allows them to taste occasionally and by stealth the pleasures of the mind . Such men can never acquire a sufficiently intimate knowledge of the art of literature to appreciate its more delicate beauties ; and as the time they can devote to letters is very short , they seek to make the best use of the whole of it . Therefore , they prefer books which may be easily procured , quickly read , and which require no learned researches to be under  --  stood . They ask for beauties , self-proffered , and easily enjoyed . Above all , they must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struggle , the crosses , and the monotony of practical life , they re  --  quire rapid emotions and startling passages ? truths or errors brilliant enough to rouse them up and to plunge them at once , as if by vio  --  lence , into the midst of a subject . On the Presumptuous Manner in Which Americans Build Their Public Monuments The several States of the Union are every day planning and erecting for themselves prodigious under  --  takings which would astonish the en  --  engineers of the great European na  --  tions . For example , the Americans have traced out the circuit of an im  --  mense city on the site which they intended to make their capital , but which , up to the present time , is hardly more densely peopled than Pontoise . According to them , it will one day contain a million of in  --  habitants and they have already rooted up trees for ten miles round , lest they should interfere with the future citizens of this imaginary metropolis . They have also erected a magnificent palace for Congress in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pompous name of the Capitol . In democratic communities the imagination is compressed when men consider themselves ; it ex  --  pands indefinitely when they think of the State . Hence it is that the same men who live on a small scale in narrow dwellings , frequently aspire to gigantic splendour in the erection of their public monu  --  ments . That Democratic Nations Show an Ardent and Enduring Love of Equality The first and most intense pas  --  sion which is engendered by the equality of conditions is , I need hardly say , the love of that same equality . I think that democratic com  --  munities have a natural taste for freedom ; left to themselves , they will seek it , cherish it , and view any privation of it with regret . But for equality , their passion is ardent , insatiable , incessant , and invincible . They call for equality in freedom , and if they can not obtain that , they still call for equality in slavery . They will endure poverty , ser  --  vitude , barbarism , but they will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
