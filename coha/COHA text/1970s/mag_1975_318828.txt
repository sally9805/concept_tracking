The Constitution provides only that the Senate shall advise and consent on the President 's conduct of foreign affairs , but it is not easy for Congress thus to restrict itself . Lately , to an extraordinary degree , Congress has tried to take a hand not merely in the setting of goals , or the examination of Administration policy , but in the tactical conduct of foreign affairs . The results have been alarming . <P> Eight months ago , Congress banned all sales of arms to America 's NATO ally , Turkey . The official reason was that Turkey had illegally used U.S. weapons in the 1974 invasion of Cyprus , and a number of Congressmen argued that the ban would pressure the Turks into negotiating a compromise . But there were several other reasons for the vote , including strong anti-Turkish lobbying by Greek Americans and a feeling that Secretary of State Henry Kissinger had both mishandled the Cyprus crisis and failed to show sufficient deference to Congress . <P> The only results of the congressional action : a Cyprus settlement became more remote than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. military and intelligence-gathering facilities . <P> For months the Administration has been pressuring Congress to lift the ban . <P> Last week , as the issue headed toward a new vote , President Ford himself telephoned several wavering legislators . <P> <P> House Republican Whip Robert Michel provided a private airplane so that five friendly Congressmen could still make a key meeting out of town . The House finally voted , 237 to 176 , to end the ban . <P> The Senate took about one minute to vote its own approval of the measure . <P> It was the Administration 's first foreign policy success with Congress in months , and it is likely to be supplemented this week if , barring last-minute hitches , the Senate approves Kissinger 's Sinai agreement . Yet even here the Senate Foreign Relations Committee asserted itself by ignoring Kissinger 's pleas and releasing classified documents of the accord ( see THE WORLD ) . The crisis between Congress and the White House over who conducts foreign policy is far from over .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
