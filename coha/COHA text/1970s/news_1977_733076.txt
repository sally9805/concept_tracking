txt Airline crew members and passengers may face a new hazard : ozone sickness , which has apparently struck hundreds of persons during recent flights . Ozone gas is in a layer of the earth 's atmosphere ; normally it has been far too high to cause any problems for airline trips . But now it has apparently been causing illness because airplanes are flying higher to conserve fuel and because the ozoneitself has dipped closer to earth Whether low doses of ozone cause any long-term effects is n't known , doctors say . But in the short run enough ozone in the air can trigger a racking cough that may last for hours , severe shortness of breath , headaches , fatigue , eye irritations and sometimes bloody noses Describing one recent flight , a Pan American World Airways stewardess says , " Almost everybody in the cabin was coughing and wheezing ? the place looked like a tuberculosis sanitarium . " When the ozone sickness first struck , apparently a few months ago , no one knew what it was . The symptoms , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stewardesses over what has been happening and what to do about it have been , brewing or board planes . ? A scientific detective hunt has been under way to track down and confirm the cause . ? A series of hurried tests has been started , mainly by Boeing Co. and Pan American , to try to remedy the problem . Working on Remedies The airlines have n't made public announcements about the ozone sickness , apparently fearing that they might scare passengers away . ( Crew members interviewed generally asked that their names not be used for fear their comments would upset management . ) When asked about the problem , company executives emphasize that they are working hard on remedies . " We think we 're on the road to a solution , " says William Waltrip , Pan Am 's executive vice president for operations . The normal oxygen molecule consists of two oxygen atoms while the ozone molecule consists of three . The airline ozone problem is n't restricted to a particular type of aircraft . United Airlines , for example , says scores of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the ozone sickness . The flights were in Boeing 747 jumbo jets and Douglas ** and DC108 . Many recent cases of the illness , however , appear to be on board Pan Am flights from New York , San Francisco and Los Angeles to Tokyo . These flights use the Boeing 747 SP ( the initials stand for " special purpose " ) . The SP flies farther and higher than most other planes . For example , a mediumsize jet such as the 727 typically flies for two hours at 35,000 feet on a New York-Chicago run . On a New York-Tokyo nonstop run , a Pan Am SP flies nearly 14 hours at around 45,000 feet . The high altitude , which conserves fuel , and the long distance combine to increase exposure to the ozone high in the earth 's atmosphere . Last year , when Pan Am became the first airline in the world to introduce the SP on its routes , stewardesses were the first to begin complaining . At first , ozone was n't even suspected as a cause . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ zones , and your body gets all out of sync so you expect some minor problems , " says William Lindner , director of safety at the Transport Workers Union , which represents Pan Am stewardesses . Pan Am 's initial reaction to the complaints , Mr. Lindner adds , was that " Well , some people are hung over . " And he says , " I think management also suspected some union tactics may have been involved . " The Complaints Grow ' The stewardesses themselves were n't sure what was happening . " The girls do n't like the SP anyway because the flight is so long and the air Is so dry you become dehydrated , " one Pan Am stewardess says . " At first even I thought it must be psychosomatic . " But the number of complaints began rising ? and in strange ways . " People seemed to have trouble going out to Tokyo , but not coming back , " Mr. Waltrip of Pan Am says . " We could n't figure it out . " Pan Am then began monitoring temperature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longitude , to seek clues to what was happening . Ozone , not being suspected , was n't measurAci . In January , however , the complaints skyrocketed . " Previously we were having trouble on six to nine flights a month , but beginning in January It went to 12 to 18 flights a month , " Pan Am 's Mr. Waltrip says . As Mr. ' Lindner of the transport union puts it : " At the start of January , all hell broke loose ; over a period of months we 've gotten hundreds of complaints " Many pilots , however , still were n't affected , and some would n't believe that the stewardesses were encountering a real problem " They told us we were just a bunch of hysterical women , " snaps one stewardess ( As tt turned out , stewardesses were first to notice the ozone problem because those who are physically active ? say , to serving meals  --  are affected more than those seated , such as pilots and passengers Flights to Tokyo were affected more than return trips because westbound flights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eastbound flights Westbound flights also fly closer to the North Pole ; ozone is closer to the earth at the North Pole than it is farther south In other quirks , ozone affects nonsmokers more than smokers and affects the young more than the old ; in addition , alcohol increases ozone 's effects Complaints became increasingly severe In March , " we were four hours out ton a flight from Los Angeles to Tokyo I when I began coughing , " one Pan Am stewardess says " I coughed for two hours straight  --  a deep , hacking cough like bronchitis It stopped for a while , and then I coughed for another hour , and I was coughing up phlegm with specks of blood in it " When she arrived in Tokyo , she says , she went to bed and slept for 12 hours , and only then felt normal On another Pan Am flight , one businessman began suffering shortness of breath According to a stewardess on the flight , " he was kind of gasping and he told me , ' It feels like a heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Am and on United , began encountering the symptoms An inspector for the Federal Aviation Administration , which oversees airline safety , boarded a Pan Am SP flight The inspector got sick , with coughing , mild chest pains and dry nose tissues It was " a pretty bad case , " an FAA spokesman says Airlines stepped up their air samplings , and this time they included a measurement for ozone Even before the airlines ' problem had cropped up , the Occupational Safety and Health Administration had been proposing that industrial workers not be exposed to ozone concentrations during an eight-hour period averaging higher than 0.1 part per million According to Pan Am , its measurements soared up to 0 6 part per million The airlines quickly took some interim steps to ease the situation They suggested that pilots encountering problems reduce their altitude to avoid the ozone On March 26 United Airlines sent an internal message to crew members If symptoms develop , " pilots should immediately don their oxygen masks , select 1007- I oxygen1 and continue to use the system until the symptoms are relieved Flight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or wet paper towel held firmly over the nose and mouth Passenger symptoms can be relieved similarly . " United added : " Airlines have flown upward of 100 million hours on jet aircraft since they were introduced in 1959 , and this is the first time something of this nature has been reported . " But the problems have been continuing , partly because the ozone layer shifts and is n't easy to track and avoid " Fingers " of ozone may point down toward earth : Boeing says some airlines have reported cases of ozone sickness as low as 37,000 feet on U S domestic flights . In addition , some pilots still scoff at the problem , J F. Garfield , a Pan Am captain and a member of the aeromedical committee of the Air Line Pilots Association , says ozone " does n't look like a serious thing The power of suggestion among the girls is terrific , " he adds " It 's like among high-school kids ; when one faints , they all start fainting . " Stewardesses maintain that some pilots are n't willing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ According to one Pan Am stewardess , on a recent flight the pilot would n't descend even though " lots of people were coughing badly " She adds : " The people were frightened . After a few hours you get claustrophobic on those long flights anyway , and then , when you find you have trouble breathing . " A Pan Am spokesman denies that pilots are refusing to cut altitude . The stewardesses also say they are having trouble themselves doing their work " I 've seen girls incapacitated  --  they just have to sit down and put their head between their'legs But it 's our job , and most of us just keep stumbling through , " one says Another stewardess on Pan Am says flight attendants are trying to switch the work load , performing the heavier work , such as serving the main meal , early in the flight and trying to rest more later on when the ozone sickness is more likely to hit . Pan Am is working on solutions better than simply reducing , altitude . The air in a plane 's cabin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the air is taken from a hotter stage of the compressors , the heat breaks down the ozone , eliminating the problem . During a recent test flight over Montreal , Pan Am says this method cut the ozone from 0.4 part per million to under 0.1 . The problem with this solution is that using hotter air to break down ozone instead of driving the jet engines imposes a fuel penalty of about 3% . Pan Am burns 910 million gallons of fuel a year , and at that rate 3% is " damned expensive , " says Mr. Waltrip , the executive vice president . As a result . Boeing is trying to find a filtering system to block ozone intake Boeing is n't talking about its tests , but one airline source says that Boeing tried copper filters that " looked like Brillo pads " and that they did n't work Boeing has also been trying cotton , glass-fiber and charcoal filters , it is un-derstood The problem could go away all by itself , at least for this summer The ozone layer may be lower this year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spell may drive it above even the highest airline flights , at least for a while Those encountering ozone sickness , meanwhile , seem to be recovering within a couple of hours after a flight United has been giving a battery of medical tests , including chest X-rays and pulmonary-function tests , to stewardesses after they have been sick Dr George Kidera , United 's vice president for medical services , says that thus far the tests have n't turned up any ill effects . But there is still concern Ozone in high concentrations is widely used in the chemical industry , and doctors know that at extremely high concentrations  --  say 10 parts per million , or 100 times the OSHA recommended level ? ozone can cause swelling in the lungs , bleeding and death There are also studies , mostly in animals , suggesting that even at low concentrations , ozone might cause serious cellular damage But longterm studies in man are few " Little is known about chronic exposure to very low concentrations such as might be expected to occur in air crews flying frequently at high altitudes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the FAA 's office of aviation medicine Despite the problem that ozone poses for airlines , it plays a beneficial role in that it shields the earth from much of the sun 's ultraviolet radiation , which can cause skin cancer The fluorocarbons contained in many aerosol sprays are facing a ban because these chemicals waft upward and pose the danger of destroying a portion of the protective ozone Because of the worries for aviation , Boeing and the airlines are pushing as fast as they can to find a good solution for the problem A Pan Am stewardess , boarding a flight to Tokyo a few days ago , told a reporter : " This is our best plane  --  it has all the latest gadgets to take care of the ozone " She added hopefully , " Maybe we wo n't have any problems this flight .
