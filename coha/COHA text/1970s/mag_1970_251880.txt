Officially , the campaign had not even begun , but the snipers were already at work . The Labor Party 's sharpshooters opened their advertising effort with a photo of six figurines , representing Tory leaders , over a headline : YESTERDAY 'S MEN THEY FAILED BEFORE . The Conservatives matched it with a huge photo of an overflowing wastebasket headlined : LABOUR SAY THEY WILL FIGHT ON THEIR RECORD . GOOD . HERE IT IS . Plainly , Britain is in for several weeks of cutting exchanges before the June 18 elections . <P> At the moment , Labor Prime Minister Harold Wilson holds an edge-a remarkable fact inasmuch as the Tories enjoyed a 26.8% majority in one public opinion poll only last year . At that time Conservative Leader Edward ( " Ted " ) Heath and his party had everything going for them , most notably a sick economy . But as winter melted into spring , some of Labor 's economic policies began taking hold . The delayed effects of Wilson 's 1967 devaluation of the pound were finally being felt . The hold-down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impact . There was new confidence in the pound , particularly in the wake of France 's devaluation and West Germany 's revaluation . As a result , the country 's chronic balance of payments deficit was turned into a projected $1.2 billion surplus for 1970 . A bullish mood was in the air , and voters began to feel their pocketbooks swelling with widespread wage increases averaging 6% in the past six months alone . The change of British fortunes was soon reflected in local elections and opinion polls . <P> Full of confidence , Wilson last week delivered to Heath a note on his 10 Downing Street writing paper that began teasingly : " Dear Ted , I thought it might be helpful to let you know . . . " Then Wilson drove past the freshly gilded gates of Buckingham Palace in his black Rover to ask the Queen to dissolve Parliament so that the three-week campaign could get under way . <P> Fading Glitter . Another important factor in Wilson 's decision to call elections may well have been that current economic cheeriness may ebb by fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Inevitably , price increases will follow those glittering wage hikes . April cost-of-living figures , released last week , showed a 2% rise , sharpest for any month in two years . Retail price increases this year will run about 7% . Unemployment , at 2.5% as of last week , is the highest for any May since 1940 . In addition , there was the prospect that renewed troubles this summer in Northern Ireland would embarrass Wilson . Until Wilson 's Home Secretary , James Callaghan , last week pressured South Africa 's all-white Sprinkbok cricket team into canceling its scheduled visit , there was also the likelihood of anti-apartheid protests from British liberals , which might have stirred up a pro-Tory " law-and-order " vote .
