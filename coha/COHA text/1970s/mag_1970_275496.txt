The Bank of America has been a frequent target for the attacks of radical dissenters . In a San Francisco speech last week , Chairman Louis Lundborg , 64 , entered an eloquent plea for understanding . Excerpts : <P> WE all lose by violence , whether we be young , old , liberal , conservative , hippie or square . As a nation , we are wounded by such acts , whenever they occur ; and as individuals , we lose one of the foundation stones of all our freedom to live our lives . Sometimes I could weep for the young who have condoned violence in the name of liberal goals , because I know that they will be the first casualties if the violent trend were to continue to its ultimate end . The natural sequel to left-wing radical rebellion is right-wing reaction and repression . <P> There is a new value system emerging in this country . For generations we have been mouthing the cliche , " You ca n't stand in the way of progress . " Now there is a new generation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " That generation-and an increasing number of its elders-are saying , " Prove to us that it really is progress . " In a sense , that is the essence of everything that is stirring and boiling and seething : thoughtful people in increasing numbers are asking about one thing after another , " Is it really progress-progress for the human condition ? " <P> What they say they want does n't sound so different , you know , from what our founding fathers said they wanted . They said they wanted the freedom to be their own men , the freedom for self-realization . We have lost sight of that a bit in this century - but the young people are prodding us and saying , " Look , Dad-this is what it 's all about . " <P> We have two choices as to which way we can go . We can divide into camps and shoot it out , or we can try to find common grounds so that we can grow together again . One course is easy but is blind ; the other course is hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One course leaves all the thinking to someone else ; the other requires deep , painful thought in a never-ending search for answers . One course will bring bloodshed , destruction and ultimate crushing of freedom-the crushing of the human spirit ; the other course can bring peace and with it a hope for the rekindling of the American Dream .
