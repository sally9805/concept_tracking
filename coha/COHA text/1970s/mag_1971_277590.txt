Disposing of a newspaper , even a profitable one , can sometimes be a problem . E.W. Scripps Co. , owner of the 18-paper Scripps-Howard chain , had been directed by the Justice Department in 1964 to sell its majority stock interest in Cincinnati 's money-making morning Enquirer ( 1970 profit : $2,100,000 ) and thus break up the Scripps-Howard monopoly in the city . Scripps also owns the evening Post &; Times-Star . But finding an acceptable buyer for the Enquirer has given Scripps fits . <P> The paper 's employees offered to buy the stock at $35 a share , and Scripps was willing . But four minority stockholders sued to prevent the sale , claiming the price was too low . Then Scripps announced last month an impending sale to the Blue Chip Stamps Co. of California . That move stimulated a bid of $40 a share from American Financial Corp. Scripps switched signals and said it would sell to American Financial . <P> But nobody is signing over any stock just yet . The Justice Department has the right to object to any buyer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Federal Reserve Board must give its approval . The Justice Department 's original deadline for divestiture of the Enquirer was Feb. 11 , but there was no official complaint when it passed unmet ; it seemed Scripps was at least trying to make a sale .
