txt President Ford and Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger now want to build grassroots support for their beleaguered foreign policy , by sending the charismatic Secretary of State on a series of speeches around the United States . Already this year , Dr. Kissinger has spoken in Los Angeles , Houston , St. Louis , Kansas City , and , most recently , in Atlanta . No future dates are yet scheduled , according to State Department aides . The new message being carried by Secretary Kissinger to the " heartland of America " is : That the " problems confronting us are so complex , and the challenges so grave , that only with strong public support . . . can we master what lies before us . " Clearly , from Dr. Kissinger 's latest speeches and tactics , the Ford administration feels pressed from two directions : ? Allies like Turkey , Greece , and Thailand are threatening to withdraw from alliances or limit American activities on their territory . The nine-nation Common Market is increasingly going its own way . ? Congress has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notably , by cutting off'arms aid to Turkey and excluding Communist states from most-favored-nation trading status . Dr. Kissinger , speaking in Atlanta , issued perhaps the bluntest warning yet to U.S. allies not to put pressure on Washington by threatening to pull out of existing alliances . Currently Greece is taking steps to disengage from NATO . Turkey says it will reduce , perhaps shut down , critically important U.S. monitoring installations in that country unless Congress relents and allows weapons to flow again to the Ankara regime .

" We will not accept , " warned Dr. Kissinger , " that another country 's security is more important to us than it is to itself . " Thus , the Secretary of State reminded allies that the U.S. strategic shield , once withdrawn , might leave a smaller power dangerously alone , to combat pressures from the Soviet bloc . Apparently Mr. Ford and Dr. Kissinger hope that Americans , if made aware of the complexity and gravity of U.S. relations with nations overseas , might put pressure on Congress to erase strictures on foreign policy . Meanwhile , the White House continues to work quietly with congressional leaders to find some way of restoring weapons deliveries // * Kissinger bid // to Turkey ? eastern bastion of NATO ? and to give Communist China , Romania , and perhaps other Communist powers most-favored-nation tariff status . On other topics Dr. Kissinger says : ?
