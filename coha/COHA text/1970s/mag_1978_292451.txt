Jimmy Carter 's sentimental journey through the tobacco lands of North Carolina the other day was a tonic for him . But despite the cheers , the line he followed took him right down the old route of confusion . <P> Carter was almost poetic when he talked about " the beautiful quality of your tobacco . " He grew eloquent in describing his tobacco-farming ancestors , the " backbreaking labor ... honest work . " He mentioned God and all the church-going families , and finally he was moved to suggest that there was no incompatibility between promoting good health and promoting a good tobacco crop . He even offered the idea that the Federal Government would continue its research " to make the smoking of tobacco even more safe than it is today . " <P> Some of those 29 million people who have given up cigarettes clutched momentarily at the hint that smoking might be safe after all and their valiant struggle was unnecessary . The Tobacco Institute , lobby for the industry , declared , " We could not have written it Carter 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on cue , Gio Batta Gori , a high official of the Government-financed National Cancer Institute , announced a short-term study showing that some of the new cigarettes were so low in toxins that they could be smoked in " tolerable " numbers without appreciable bad effects on average smokers . <P> At the Department of Health , Education and Welfare , which runs the antismoking campaign , people muttered a few words of sympathy for a President caught up in politics and went about their job of urging the nation to give up cigarettes . But when the new report on " tolerable " cigarette smoking hit the front pages , both an alarmed Surgeon General and Gori 's boss at NCI went public to repudiate Gori and make sure everyone understood that cigarette smoking was still not considered safe . The federal antismoking campaign thus rolled on , expecting an extra $10 million from Carter 's new budget . <P> The anatomy of this whole episode is instructive . North Carolina was a state important to Carter 's political rise , and it is considered pivotal to his future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Government 's antismoking drive . So it was natural to target North Carolina early in the President 's plans for political rehabilitation . The tactics called for praise of tobacco farming , a promise of continued price supports . That North Carolina 's tobacco somehow ends up in those cigarettes that Carter 's Government is trying to keep people from using was buried beneath some good-natured kidding about HEW Secretary Joe Califano.
