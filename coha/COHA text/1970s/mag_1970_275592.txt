Jack Nicholson is either a mountebank or a highly gifted actor . Possibly he is both . As the dead-eyed hero of a couple of obscure westerns that he produced himself ( The Shooting and Ride the Whirlwind ) , he made Clint Eastwood look like Laurence Olivier . In Easy Rider , he walked on and won the film from Dennis Hopper and Peter Fonda . Then he descended to his former persona in On a Clear Day , playing either Barbra Streisand 's lover or a codfish . It was difficult to tell which . <P> Now , in Five Easy Pieces , Nicholson has retaken the high ground . He is Robert , an oil rigger , beering and wenching with the worst of them . One morning , caught in a traffic jam , Robert explodes . He clambers aboard a moving van , uncovers an old upright and begins playing a delicate Chopin fantasy . <P> Chopin ? This is no ordinary roustabout , no average hardhat . This is a supergypsy , Robert Eroica Dupea , scion of a musical family , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1969 . Indeed , the same studio that produced Easy Rider has manufactured an undrugged , mature version of that film , complete with central emblem : the road as panacea . But now , if something in the plot has thickened , something in the pulse has slowed . <P> Improper Fingering . Robert has taken a series of pickup jobs , losing himself in the lives of common laborers . He has even impregnated a short-order waitress named Rayette , shrewdly played by Karen Black . The yammering redhead is like an anonymous grain of sand that becomes a major irritation in the viewer 's eye . She and circumstance are enough to drive Robert to the family home on an island in Puget Sound . There he views the wreckage of three lives . His autocratic father is paralyzed by strokes ; his brother is a priggish martinet ; his rabbity sister Tita ( Lois Smith ) , an accomplished recital pianist , still looks as if someone is about to rap her knuckles for improper fingering . <P> Therein lie the liabilities and virtues of this rich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has to work solely with her face ; she does not get much aid from the script . Nor does Nicholson . Is Robert running away from excellence , or from the fear of failure ? In one long pan , Producer-Director Bob Rafelson tries to supply an answer . Robert plays a Chopin prelude in an attempt to seduce his brother 's protge ( Susan Anspach ) . Up moves the camera to a wall of pictures . There are the young siblings , smiling , optimistic , untouched . On an adjacent wall , the children are grown , the faces strained and damned , the father satanically peering from behind a flowing beard , all silk and grosgrain . That interlude is album riffling , not film making . Such short cuts summon memories less of Robert 's early years than of Cornel Wilde 's , when he played Freddie Chopin in A Song to Remember . <P> Unequal Time . Amongst mannerisms and quirks , Nicholson rides uneasily . As he plays him , Robert is a hollow man who can grab but not touch ; in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prodigy is pathetically credible . But his attempts at humor make him look a bit like a third Smothers brother , and Nicholson 's now familiar laconic manner and smile often appear to be a handy substitute for acting .
