A story by Bohumil Hrabal DIAMOND EYES Translated by Michael Heim T HE PASSENGER had already placed his foot on the first rung of the steps to the railroad car when somebody caught him by the arm . He turned around to see a middle-aged man standing on the platform . " Excuse me , but are you going all the way to Prague ? " he asked . " Why , yes , I am , " said the passenger . " Then you would n't mind taking my daughter Vendulka with you ? She 'll be met at the station in Prague . " He delivered a girl of about sixteen into the passenger 's hands . The stationmaster blew his whistle , and the conductor first helped the girl into the car , then signaled with his hand that the train was ready to go . The stationmaster gave the final signal , and the train was off . The girl 's father ran alongside the train yelling , " Vendulka , we 've got our fingers crossed . And as soon as you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " I hear you , " she called to him . " You want me to send a telegram . " When the train had passed the ALL CLEAR AHEAD signal , the passenger opened the door and led the girl into the corridor . He was still holding her by the hand , and had no idea what to do with her . " Really ! " began a monologue issuing from a nearby compartment . " Once , even before we were married , she went to buy me a shirt , but she could n't buy anything , because she did n't know my size . She was nearly out the door when she had an idea . When I go to choke him , I always have my hands like this . ' So the salesman took a tape measure and measured the circumference of her hands and said , ' Sixteen . ' And see ? The shirt fits like a glove . " The doors slid open , and out ran a baldheaded man doubled up with laughter . " No , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his fist on the wooden wall of the railroad car . Once he had calmed down a bit , he went back into the compartment , where the same voice continued its story . " So I said to myself , if she could go out and get me that shirt , well , then I 'll surprise her with a little hat for Christmas . So I go to the high fashion modes robes , and I say , I 'd like that pretty little hat you have there in the window . ' And modes robes says to me , she says , ' What size would you like ? ' Well , at first I did n't know , but then I had an idea . Once , when we were having a quarrel , I gave my fiancee a little love tap like this . She had the feel of her head in my hand ever since and from that day to this I have the feel of her head in me . And modes robes brought me out hat after hat , and I tried each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , ' This is it ! ' And I put it under the tree , and it fit her like a bedpan fits a fanny . " Again the bald-headed man burst out of the compartment , pressing his handkerchief to his mouth , gasping for breath . He pushed the girl aside , stuck his head out the window , and again began beating his fist against the wall . " He 's too much , that guy . Too much ! " he said , wiping away his tears . The passenger who had been entrusted with the girl  --  he was still holding her by the hand  - -  followed the bald man resolutely into the compartment . " Gentlemen , " said the girl when she had gotten inside , " my name is Vendulka Krigtova and I am going to Prague ! " She stretched out her hands and felt her way in front of her . The first thing she touched was the curly head of the storyteller . " My name is Emil Krasa , " he said in response . " And I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man leading the girl brushed up against the bald man 's head while putting his briefcase in the luggage rack overhead . " Ca n't you watch what you 're doing . dammit ? " " Sorry . " " Did somebody hit somebody ? " asked the girl . " That happens to me all the time . I 'm the one who takes our letters to the mailbox , and I knew the way there and back like I know my own name . Then one day those damn mailmen switched it two buildings closer , and I rammed my forehead into the corner of the green mail-81 box and hurt myself . But 1 got even . All it took was a few whacks of the old white stick . " " Come sit over here by the window , " said the bald man , wiping his eyes . " It 'll give you a better view of the scenery . " The girl first felt around for the seat and then for the window . She held out her hand parallel to the ground , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " How nicely the sun is shining , " she said , The passengers fell silent . 117 ( TAS THAT YOUR FATHER there at the sta- 111 V tion ? " asked the man who had taken her from him . " Yes , it was , " she said . " What a character he is , though ! Everyone is jealous of me . My father grows fruit for a living , and once he ran over our crippled neighbor with his delivery truck . And there was a trial , and all papa 's enemies were as happy as could be . ' Serves him right , ' they said . ' Now he 'll either get thrown in the clink or have some steep fine slapped on him . ' But who should come running crutchlessinto the courtroom , chipper as you please , but our neighbor , the one he 'd run over . She could n't get enough of kissing his hands and thanking him for doing such a good job ; she could walk again , without the crutches . ' If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' she said , I might have found a husband . ' " " Sounds like a fine father you 've got there , " said the curly-headed man . " Do n't I , though , " she said laughing . She put out her hand again , but just at that moment the train went into a curve and moved the sun from the compartment window to the corridor window . " Sun 's gone down , " she said . The passengers looked at one another and nodded . " What does your father do ? " she asked , placing her hand on the knee of the curly-headed storyteller . " He 's been in retirement for the past fifteen years because he 's got the biggest heart in all Europe . His heart is as big as a bucket , and it sits right in the middle of his chest . " " Sure , sure , " said the bald-headed man . John Diele " Why , that 's wonderful ! " cried Vendulka . " I 'll say , " continued the curly-headed man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he dies , they get his heart . Some foreigners once offered him quite a pile , but he 's a real patriot . He would n't give it to them for anything . Father 's not allowed to go swimming or fly in an airplane or even ride an express train . " " I know why ! " cried the girl . " So his heart does n't burst or get lost . Right ? " She felt around for the hand of the curly-headed storyteller and squeezed it . " Fathers like yours and mine are one of a kind ! " " That 's right , " he said with what looked very much like a blush . " Sometimes I go to the university with him . First they take all his clothes off , and then they draw blue and red lines all over him . " " Right ! Right ! " said Vendulka enthusiastically . " Because the red lines are arteries and the blue lines veins ! " " Right , " said the man covering her hand with his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room , and the students crowd all around him and bend over him , and the professor points all over him like he was a map , and explains things . And then he hooks up a student 's heart to a megaphone , and it sounds just like a toy drum or a soldier marching up and down the hall of a barracks . Then , when they hook up my father 's heart . . . " " It 's like a thunderstorm in the distance ! " cried the girl . " Like a splitting boulder ! Like tons of potatoes pouring down into the cellar ! Like Emil Gilels playing the piano ! " " Exactly , " said the curly-headed man , surprised , and he loosened his collar . " You ca n't imagine how happy I am to be here with you ! " she exclaimed . " How nice it is to know that someone else has a famous father too ! " The train was running parallel to a paved road . It passed a billboard picturing a big , blue heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read : FOR YOUR HEART , TRY THE WATERS AT PODEBRADY SPA . A feeling of mystery pervaded the compartment . " The professor at the university just ca n't wait to dig into that strange heart with his scalpel . " " Of course he ca n't , " said the girl . " And now another Czech heart will become famous . " " But who can measure up to your father ? " said the bald man , taking down his briefcase . " Oh , absolutely , " she said . " But you have to see my father to believe him . You ought to watch him dance ! " she cried , clapping her hands . " When we roll up the rug , there 's always a circle around us . Papa does a great solo , too . Once , when he slipped the bandmaster a bill and was about to launch into his favorite song . a policeman came along and told him he could n't sing . Well , one thing led to another until pow ! Papa slammed him one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the policeman had a crooked nose to begin with . Oh my , the blood ! And then Papa did his singing act . Well . all the neighbors were as happy as could be . Old man Kii.qova 's gone and done it this time ! ' they said to one another . But when the trial came up four months later , the handsome po ? liceman swore he had asked for , even ordered , the punch in the nose . He had nothing for Papa but the most heartfelt thanks . You see , before Papa hit him , his nose had been bent over to the right . And Papa 's punch straightened it out so nicely that the daughter of a rich farmer fell in love with him and they got married . Instead of thank-you notes they send Papa a platter of cakes and cookies every summer and in the winter some fresh pork every time they slaughter . " N OW , WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT that a punch in the nose could lay the basis for a happy family , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What does your papa do ? " asked Vendulka . " He has gone on to a better world , " he said . " He was such a good father that it 's taken me until now  --  now that he 's gone  --  to realize it . He always worked the night shift , and when Mama would hear the gate creaking in the morning , she 'd fill the tub with boiling water . Then Papa would leave his allotment in the courtyard . . . " " Allotment of what ? " she asked . " The coal that miners brought home in a huge pocket sewn into their coats . Then he 'd come upstairs and take off his clothes . Mama had already put on the coffeepot , and he 'd wash up and sit and eat his bread and wash it down with coffee . And while he ate and drank , he would take off his boots and put on his good shoes and get dressed up . He always managed to finish his coffee and put on his cap at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Blue Star for cards with the boys , and at lunchtime I 'd take him his lunch , and he 'd eat it while he played . At four he 'd come home and lie down on the floor  --  to give the old skeleton a chance to straighten itself out , as he used to say . And when he 'd had his sleep , he 'd go back to the mines . But one day , Mama filled the tub . . . " The train had begun to slow down , and the bald man gave Vendulka his hand . " Best of luck . This is where I get off , " he said on his way out into the corridor . The train came to a stop . Vendulka felt along the window for the handle , pulled it down , and called out onto the platform of the country station , " Mister ! Mister ! Tell me how it ends ! Tell me how it turns out ! " The bald man stepped up to the window and went on . " Mama @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't come home . When the water had cooled off , she went out to look for him . In the doorway she stumbled over Papa 's pipe ... " The train started moving , but the bald man trotted alongside to keep up . " And Mama picked up the pipe and burst into tears . She wrapped her shawl around her and ran over to the mines . .. Papa had been crushed to death by a rock . . His friends had come to tell her .... But they just could n't do it .... So they put the pipe up against the door and ran away .... You know , I never saw my mother asleep ? ... She was always up by the time I got up .... When I went to bed ... she was always mending something .... It was n't until later ... that I saw her asleep .... " Finally he stopped and took a deep breath . " Please forgive me , sir . Sir , please forgive me for having a father who is still alive ! Forgive me. sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A SHORT SILENCE , the man who had IAC been entrusted with the girl said , " My father was a tanner , and he had a disease they used to call old man 's blight . Year after year they had to cut off more and more of his legs until in the end he went around on a little cart . He planted roses for a hobby . They covered the whole wall of the tannery . They were called tea roses and they were yellow . Papa knew exactly how many there were . He was the only one allowed to cut them , and he would only cut them for the church and for young ladies . Then one day they built a street through our wall , and that was the end of the tea roses . Father thought it would be the end of him , too , until he thought up another hobby . He 'd ride out to a very dangerous curve in the road and direct traffic . First with his hands and later with a flag . From morning to night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an umbrella to his cart . He kept it up for eight years , and when he died , there were hundreds of trucks at his funeral , and the curve where he had stood was covered with flowers . This high ! " " How high ? " asked Vendulka . " This high , " he said , lifting the girl 's hand to the proper level . " But when they started having accidents there again , they put up two large mirrors . " " My oh my , you have a famous father too , " she said . " A father who changed into a mirror . Into two mirrors ! " The passengers first looked at one another and then out the window . The train was just coming into a town with two round mirrors , like a gigantic pince-nez , reflecting a blind curve . A feeling of mystery pervaded the compartment . The passenger escorting the girl cleared his throat and said , " Your father looked quite thin there at the station . " " You should have seen him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cardiomyoliposis and all sorts of liver , stomach , and kidney trouble thrown in . The doctor put him on a diet , but Papa was weak-willed ; he liked to eat . Then one day the herbwoman advised him that the only thing that would help him develop his will power was to go say something very insulting to the police . Well , it worked ! They took him clown to the station , and Papa dictated his insults into the records and signed his name to them , and they gave him six months . And were his enemies overjoyed ! ' Thank God that bastard will be out of our hair for a while , ' they said . But when Papa got out , he was as skinny as a rail , and the first thing he did was hold a press conference at the Garland , treat everyone to beers , and say , Let me tell you . There 's no diet anywhere that 's as efficient as jail . And not only am I hale and hearty ; I picked up 2,000 crowns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his coat was on him , and all our beer-bellied neighbors had to admit there was no one quite Like old man Kii  --  tova . You know what would be nice if you do n't have anything against it ? Why not come to one of our Thursday-evening dances ? We could trip the light fantastic ! " " Dance ? " asked the curly-headed man , slightly taken aback . " Why not ? I 'm grown-up enough , are n't I ? But let 's hold off for another two months , okay ? The doctor told me that when I got to be sixteen he 'd operate on me , and my operation 's set for this week ! Then have a chance to see this beautiful world , too . I 'll see people and things and the countryside and my work . I 'm sure those baskets I weave are beautiful ! I 'm sure the whole world is beautiful ! " " You are ? " asked the man she had gotten on with , forcing a smile . " Oh , and how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cried . " There 's a man who works with me who had an unhappy love affair before he came to us . He was so unhappy he kept scratching around under his eyelids with an indelible pencil . Finally the doctor said to him , ' Look here , ' he said . ' If you do that once more , you wo n't see any more of this great big beautiful world . ' And the man said , ' I 'm through with this great big beautiful world ! ' And he went back to scratching around under his eyelids with an indelible pencil . Now he 's weaving baskets with me , and does he howl about how he misses the world . The world must be beautiful , as beautiful as your father , who changed into two mirrors . Oh , in two months I 'll be able to see ! Will you do me the honor and come dance with me ? " The door slid open . " Tickets , please , " said the young conductor , yawning with boredom .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
