So many U.S. advertising agencies have crowded into Europe that late starters have a hard time finding a place in the crowd . Still , the 20th biggest U.S. agency last week joined with the largest agency in France and the second largest one in Britain to form an international advertising network . Manhattan-based Needham Harper &; Steers , which had billings last year of $115 million , made the deal with Britain 's S. H. Benson and France 's Univas , the international arm of Havas Conseil .

Havas Conseil is an attractive partner , partly because its parent company , Agence Havas , is 56% owned by the French government . In France close ties to the top can be an asset for any newcomer attempting to traverse the bureaucratic maze . Through a subsidiary , the French agency also has exclusive contracts to operate in the Soviet Union , East Germany and Yugoslavia . That arrangement will give Needham Harper an entry into the still primitive but potentially important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
