ARCHAIC cultural rites do survive in New York . One of them is the fertility festival . The Corn God is chosen ; he reigns for a year , credited with power , laden with honors and trophies . Then , at winter solstice , he is killed . A new Corn God takes his place . This cumbersome cycle was once thought to ensure the growth of crops . Today it is mainly practiced in Manhattan 's art world . Discovering-or inventing-a new Corn God every year is a basic market strategy , since art consumers , strung out on the disintegrating pluralism of American art in the early ' 70s , constantly need fresh inspiration . The newest beneficiary and victim of this method is realist art . <P> The fantasy is that a realist movement exists in America-in the sense that Cubism , for instance , was a coherent movement with defined aims . The word movement , in fact , is mere packaging : a bogus form of authentication aimed at nervous collectors who demand instant history . In reality , the scenario is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across it , and the strongest realists-like Alfred Leslie and Philip Pearlstein-produce work that would have commanding authority whatever the current fashion . <P> The Bundle . At one end of this spectrum sits a neatly bundled phenomenon called Radical Realism or , to give it the name of a new show consecrating it at the Janis Gallery , " Sharp-Focus Realism . " Well before the opening , it was clear that the show 's promoters expected the style to have the same razzy , traumatic effect on New York taste that Pop art had in 1962-and that they were ready to use the same kind of ballyhoo to ensure it . In a way , this was fitting . The creation is Pop 's son . <P> The characteristics of the style are extreme , deadpan literalness of image , generally repainted from photos with an airbrush , immaculate precision of surface , and a taste for mechanical subjects such as cars , fire trucks and long expanses of shiny kitchenware . The average result is an almost unimaginably stupid and passive materialism-the boredom of Warhol 's silk-screened photos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nth time with another perfect rendering of reflections on the chrome gizzard of a Harley-Davidson or the pastille skin of a Volkswagen , one is apt to recall Truman Capote 's sneer ( about another medium ) that " this is n't writing , it 's typing . " <P> Yet a minority of airbrush realists do explore one important problem of naturalism : how much information can a painted surface carry , and when does it start usurping the denseness of reality itself ? California Artist Richard McLean 's Rustler Charger ( done from a black-and-white photo in a horse magazine ) contains an unassimilable welter of detail , from the pebbles on the ground to the stitching on the girl 's pants to the last speckle on the horse 's coat . But , says McLean , 37 , " it 's not just a blown-up photo . I try to get a more heightened sense of reality , to make it a more startling and palpable thing to react to than a photograph is . Those people on the horse are more real to you than they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in real life in a field . "
