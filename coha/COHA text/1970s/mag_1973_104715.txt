Mae'n bleser cael y tenis yna yng Nhogledd Cymru , " Mr. Gordon Griffiths from the Isle of Anglesey announced expansively at the start of the matches at Deeside Leisure Centre . For the benefit of any illiterate Saes  --  that is , Englishmen  --  who happened to be around , he added , " It 's great to have this class of tennis here in North Wales . " Outside the center what the Liverpool Daily Post reckoned as the worst fog to hit Britain for almost a decade was being rapidly dispersed by a determined-looking blizzard and agonized messages kept pouring in . Please stop them parking on the hockey pitch ; it 's beginning to flood . We must have printed too many tickets for section 10 ; can they sit in the aisles ? But Mr. Griffiths ' euphoria , and the euphoria of every Welshman at Deeside , remained undiminished . Two years of plotting and planning had come to fruition : World Championship of Tennis was holding its first European tournament of the season right there in the tiny Welsh county of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyway . The fancy second part and the finals would be in London . But Ken Rosewall , Arthur Ashe , Fred Stolle and company would fight out the preliminary rounds at a sports center built by the Hawarden Rural District Council to serve an area of 50 square miles and a population of 40,000 . At Deeside last week the quickest way to instant unpopularity was by unguardedly referring to the venue as Chester . Certainly the players , the press and officials from the sponsors , Rothmans , the tobacco company , were all based in the English city on the wrong side of the River Dee , with its Roman wall built to keep the cattle-stealing Welsh from the lush plains of Cheshire . But just a mile or so through Chester 's suburbs you come on a sign  --  " Croeso i'r Cymru " it says , " Welcome to Wales . " It is Wales right enough , and within 10 miles of Chester you can hear the old language spoken in the streets . // Understandably this was all a little bewildering for WCT players @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rome and London . Arthur Ashe , though , had at least heard of Wales . " What I was really hoping to do up here , " he said , " was go down a coal mine . Is n't Wales all coal mines ? " It would probably be sound policy for the Welsh tourist board to buy up and destroy all available prints of How Green Was My Valley . Meanwhile Ashe , Marty Riessen and Tom Okker had to settle for a stroll along the road , where the shops are perched high over the traffic and you walk along an open gallery at first-floor height . " I 'm going antique crazy , " said Ashe , forgetting the coal mines for a moment and diving into a shop that sold Georgian silver , grandfather clocks and what could have been Hepplewhite chairs . // Back at the Leisure Centre preparations were going ahead for the first day 's play , supervised by Mike Evans , a 36-year-old Welshman from Cardiff who came to Deeside two years ago , an ex-pro tennis coach who from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wales . At Hoylake he had met Geoff Rust of Rothmans and forcefully put his case based on the great popularity of tennis in the area ( Hoy-lake , just over the border in Cheshire , runs its tennis right after Wimbledon ) . " It was a hell of a risk for them to come outside London , " Evans says , " and they were pretty skeptical at first , but I sold ? 1,000 worth of tickets before any publicity went out at all . " // There was no need at all for Evans to be ashamed of his Leisure Centre . Eventually there will be four floodlit tennis courts , four squash courts , an ice rink , a solarium and a banquet hall , which only goes to show how cattle raiders can change their life-style . Last week 's tournament was played on a new Supreme-Court surface . All the facilities were fine , said a somewhat surprised Marty Riessen . The players had been worried about traveling into the Welsh wilderness but the lighting and the court turned out to be first class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though . " I 've lost me teapot , " screamed a local lady who had been hurriedly drafted to man the cafeteria . When asked for a cup of tea she said , " No matches , luv . You 'll have to wait till the bar opens . " // Most of the fans were a little bewildered at first , clapping at every rally , laughing nervously at mild shows of temper from the stars like hosts who are embarrassed by the behavior of their guests but who are n't going to show it . And they were a lot less partisan than a Wimbledon crowd , even when British players like Roger Taylor and Graham Stilwell were eliminated . // The crowd thinned out a bit on Saturday , the last day of the semi-tournament . After all , the England- Wales rugby match was on television that afternoon and in Wales first things must come first . By urgent popular demand a color telly was installed in the lounge high above the court so that everyone could watch the ritual clobbering of England ( 25-9 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mark Cox was achieving the only significant English victory of the day by beating Vladimir Zednik of Czechoslovakia .
