Even law-and-order advocates sometimes find their sensibilities offended by that most unstable adjunct of police work , the informer . Trained from childhood to disparage tattletales , Americans have hardly a decent word for those who give information to authorities . The glossary runs to such pejorative nouns as fink , stoolie , rat , canary , squealer . In some police argot they are snitches . Yet no major police force can operate without some of the shady types who will go where cops seldom can , perhaps to a meeting of conspirators , or do what cops wo n't , for example , shoot heroin before a cautious pusher will make a sale . Informers have long been found in every area of life , but since the McCarthy era there has not been so much public concern about them in the U.S. as there is now . <P> The chief cause has been the recent spate of celebrated cases in which police agents played a role-from the trials of the Chicago Seven and the Seattle Eight to virtually all of those involving Black Panthers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prosecution 's use of Boyd Douglas , the FBI informant central to the just-concluded Harrisburg Seven trial ( see THE NATION ) . Still more questions have been raised by the ongoing trial of 28 people accused of destroying draft files in Camden , N.J. Four weeks ago , Robert Hardy , a paid FBI informer , suddenly announced that Government money had been supplied for gas , trucks , tools and other items necessary to the raid . He contends that he acted in effect as an agent provocateur , rekindling interest in the project when the others seemed to have dropped it . <P> Variations . The word informer actually covers a variety of types . They range from the fellow who turns in a friend for tax fraud ( and collects up to 10% of whatever the Federal Government recovers ) to a full-fledged undercover Government agent like Herbert Philbrick ( / Led Three Lives ) . As Philbrick 's case suggests , the usually unsavory reputation of informers often vanishes if the cause seems especially just - or at least popular . The FBI 'S hired hand who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considerably less controversy than Boyd Douglas . <P> For many , informing is a onetime thing . On the other hand , the champion informant in the San Francisco area is responsible for an estimated 2,000 arrests a year , mostly in narcotics cases ; a retired burglar , he now earns $700 a month from the police . Not surprisingly , money is a common motive for informers . In 1775 , somewhat the worse for his fabled years of womanizing , Casanova replenished his purse by hiring out to the Venetian Inquisitors ; he provided them with political tidbits as well as a list of the major works of pornography and blasphemy to be found in the city 's private libraries . The fictional Irish betrayer Gypo Nolan , in the movie The Informer , turned in his best friend to the British for 20 . A whorehouse madam collected $5,000 for leading the FBI to John Dillinger.
