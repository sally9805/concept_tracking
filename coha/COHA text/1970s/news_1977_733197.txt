txt A number of readers , some of whose letters appear below , take us to task for identifying poverty and race as explanations . for the looting during last week 's blackout . They suggest that blacks and Hispanics are slow to take the route of hard work but quick to take the route of welfare , crime and now looting . These readers ask , as did ' many during the urban riots of the 60 's , what might be called the " my grandfather " question : " My grandfather pushed a pushcart all over the Lower . East Side to earn enough to feed and raise his family . He worked to make it . Why ca n't they ? " There are some quick answers to the question . A lot of grandfathers , with or without pushcarts , did not make it ; the scions of success do not speak for them . Conversely , increasing numbers of blacks and Hispanics have turned sweat and skill into accomplishment . Another kind of answer appeared in Thursday 's Op-Ed Page essay about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grandfather 's contemporaries were n't always such socially docile paragons of law and order . Nor were the poor Irish immigrants who took to the streets during the New York City draft riots of 1863 , who also were reviled as " animals . " Still this answer  --  which comes down to " you 're another " ? does not , finally , deal with the pushcart or with successful grandfathers . Today 's poor face an enormous economic obstacle that did not bulk so large in the lives of yesterday 's poor . Consider the immigrants of 1870 pr 1900 . They had few skills and lacked urban ways  --  but found a land thirsting for unskilled labor , whether to work farms or to build a railroad . The economy did not need sophistication . It needed them . They may have chafed at being called Hunkies or Papists , but there were jobs to be had . Now , what of the urban newcomers in our time ? Instead of jobs building railroads , they are lucky still to be among the dwindling number of workers who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have given way to suburban industrial parks , which rely not on brawn but on the fork-lift truck . As for municipal jobs , they are largely unavailable ; the old migrants are still in them . Minorities ' access to many other jobs has long been blocked by employer or union discrimination that has been so pervasive that even now we are still arguing about the continuing effects of Jim Crow seniority systems . So far , these are familiar points ; they were set out , for example , in the Kerner Commission report on riots in 1968 . Now another answer has become increasingly clear in the years since that report . Why ca n't they work to make it ? In fact , many of them are doing exactly that . As discriminatory laws and practices have fallen , minority opportunity has risen  --  and minorities have taken advantage of it . Many younger minority families have achieved approximate equality with their white counterparts , though they probably have to work harder to reach that level . The statistics of the last decade leave little doubt that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , follow them up the same ladder that so many Americans before them have climbed . What they need , in a period of astronomic unemployment among minorities , is not obsolete homilies about someone else 's grandfather , but jobs .
