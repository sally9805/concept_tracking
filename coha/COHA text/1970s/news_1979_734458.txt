txt ANDY TORRES was just about to give up . He did n't think he could take it anymore . Through the window of his little Spanish grocery , he 'd seen it all change . Month after month , year atter year , the streets grew more ominous , the alleys more vicious . For =leers he 'd lived in Humboldt Park . The day he arrived from Puerto Rico he decided this clean little neighborhood with flowers in the window boxes was where he would prosper and raise his family , American style . He would work hard and save his money , buy a little grocery , and give it 14 hours a day . He 'd live over it and raise his little girls . BUT IIIS neighborhood only seemed to he getting worse . Ile saw prosti. tutu strut brazenly on the streets . He saw gangs grow cocky , taking over the corners . He heard about shootings down the block in daylight , and sometimes listened as bullets ricocheted off fences as he lay in bed at night . Close-up with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he watched as his neighbors withdrew behind their front curtains and grew timid from the happenings on the streets . Many of them moved away . He watched as the neighborhood got rougher and meaner . City officials seemingly became willing to write the area off . Police grew more cynical , less interested in responding to calls for help and less willing to believe even the good people who tried to stay on there and survive . Tories watched all this and shook his head . " I 'll give it one last try , " he said to himself last'spring . " One more try before I give up and move out of the city for good . " I really did n't want to leave , " Torres said , " This is where I 've lived for 22 years . Where would I move to ? the moon ? Is there room there for someone like me ? I 'd thought all along that this neighborhood could be changed , but we 'd asked for help and nobody listened . We 'd talked to city officials and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promises made but never kept . " BUT TORRES held on . Then came the end of September . His wife was in the store one afternoon with her 18-year-old daughter when two teen-age girls came in , each carrying a cheese grater . They asked for some candy bars . " Just one minute , " said his wife , Ramona , who was counting out money . The girls began to swear at her , // =NO From page one Somebody . listenitig re v. ed. // calling her names because of the delay . " Are you talking to me ? " asked Mrs. Torres . " Yeah , " said the girls . And they continued their foul talk . ' ARE YOU REALLY talking to me ? " asked Mrs. Torres . " Yeah , so what ? " said one girl , " Why ? Why are you talking like this ? " asked Mrs. Torres . , " None of your business , " said the girl . " Then you take your business somewhere else if you talk like that , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one teen-age girl hit her with a cheese grater , pulling off the skin near her eye . Mrs. Torres , angered , slapped the girl . " They went to leave and called me names again , " Mrs. Torres said . " I reached for the gun we keep under the counter  --  we were robbed four years ago  --  and I put it in my coat . I said , ' Do n't talk like that in my store The girl hit me again and I slapped her back and they left laughing . " MRS . TORRES went down the street to make a phone call , and while she was gone the girls came back this time with a group armed with bottles and slicks . They asked the daughter where Mrs. Torres was , saying , " We 're going to kill her : " They spotted Mrs. Torres walking back down the sidewalk and went outside , where they jumped on her , pulling her hair , and knocking her down , bloodying her . The daughter , frightened by the sight of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gun into the air . The result was just what she wanted ? the attackers scattered . Close7up But when the police came and questioned both sides , it was Mrs. Torres and her daughter who were ' taken and locked up in jail , Not the teen-aged girls . Mr. Tones and his family el:Add not understand that . And atilt do n't . Very fast , Andy Torres ' mind was being made up . Time to , get out , he said . Nothing made sense anymore in his neigh-borhood , SEVERAL ' WEEKS Palmed . Mr. Torres Was ' . in his little store early one morning ? he opens promptly every day at 7 a.m . Two men with guns walked in . " You Richard ? " asked one gunman . " No , Urn , not . Richard , " said Andy Torres . " The syndicate sent me to kill you , Richard , " naid'one gunman . " But I 'm not Richard , " said a frightened Mr. , Torres . " I 'm Andy Torres , " and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what you got , " said one of them . And Andy Torres handed over all the , wish he had ? $1,800 ? the money he was to have used to pay his day 's bills . " They took everything I had , " Torres said . " All those long hours of work for nothing ? all gone . " WHEN THE , POLICE arrived , Torres was pale arid shaken . They asked him what the two man looked like and , barely able to talk , Andy said at first he did n't know . " You do n't know or you do n't want to know , " said one policeman smugly .. " That was , just about it i " ' Torres . said . " I felt cOmpletely abandoned . AU the ' t In I've. : eeis on tif sttieet that male you want tp and nothing changer ' , No0:ing for the gear .

They , were going to talk about all the kinds of problems that Andy Torres has had . " I did n't have too much hope , I must . tell you , " Torres said .
