txt President Sadat of Egypt has a new " very dear friend " in Washington , an embrace that needs to be understood as well as appreciated . For all the charm and hospitality of Jimmy Carter 's White House , his is a friendship of need and convenience . It is the same friendship that was so ostentatiously pressed upon Henry Kissinger 's cheeks on the banks of the Nile . The United States can and should reciprocate these sentiments , but it need not purchase them with arms . Mr. Sadat 's shift of political allegiance from the Soviet Union to the United States after the 1973 Middle East war was a shrewd , dramatic and welcome turnabout . The Russians had equipped him to attack the Israelis , an act that reinforced his stature at home and in the region . But they had little else to offer , and were not even very generous in rebuilding his war machine . The United States , by contrast , possessed enough leverage on Israel to force a withdrawal from some Egyptian territory , to permit the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concessions . The United States also held the key to international economic aid for Egypt 's struggling economy . And it symbolized the power of private capital , which Mr. Sadat wished to attract and to foster in his country . Globally , he might have tried to play off West against East , like President Nasser , his predecessor . But the evolution of his domestic order made anti-Communism more congenial . So he sent the Russians packing . Mr. Sadat has chosen well . Hence the encomiums for President Carter . The Israelis remain under American pressure to negotiate further withdrawals . Western aid has preserved Mr. Sadat 's grip on power . In American eyes , Egypt has become a moderating force in the Middle East and in northern Africa , and Mr. Sadat is a crucial actor in the effort to win Arab acceptance and security for Israel . Now the Egyptian leader is pressing for American arms . He is uncomfortable about maintaining a political commitment to Washington while still depending militarily on Moscow . He needs to assuage an army that reckons the value of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of weapons received . He says he needs arms to help keep Communism out of Africa , but that is carrying concern for American sensibilities too far ; he needs arms to stay within sight of the vastly superior Israeli forces . If the Carter Administration is serious about kicking the habit of buying diplomatic friends with military hardware , here is a good place to begin . Egypt 's weapons will fire in only one direction , and it would be senseless for the United States to be supplying both sides in another Middle East war . If at some point it became desirable to strengthen Egypt relative to Israel , this could be better done by restraining arms shipments to Israel . If the purpose is to strengthen Mr. Sadat 's regime at home , then he ought to be sustained for longer than an army 's appetite can be quelled , with further economic assistance of palpable benefit to his people . The realities that made Mr. Sadat the friend of America have not changed and they will not be shattered by a polite deferral of his request @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
