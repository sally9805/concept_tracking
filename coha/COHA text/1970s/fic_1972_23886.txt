a story by Joyce Carol Oates DID YOU EVER SLIP ON RED BLOOD : Did you ? she asked him repeatedly , angrily . Did you ever ? 1 mean did you ever slip on red blood yourself , do you know what it 's like ? CHE WEPT AND BRUSHED HER HAIR back from S her face , her eyes shut so that he could stare at her , starkly , closely , so that she hid nothing from him . Her nudeness made her radiant in the dim , coarse light of a winter afternoon . He felt how her nudeness was in her face , behind her eyes , in the pressure of her angry eyelids against her eyes . Everything about her was hard , smooth , stark , without deception . " Nobody knows what we know , " he said . She said nothing . Her eyes were still closed . The sheet had fallen away from her and she was shadowy in the dim light of this room he rented for them . It did not look out onto the sky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blinds were always closed , there was nothing to see . Here , he had to see her with his hands , groping anxiously at her body with his hands . He could not believe in her except when they were together like this . She slipped from his mind , slipped out of focus . When they were together in this room she was brought up close to him , as if centered in the telescopic sight of a rifle . They met like this for the first time in December . That was six weeks after the day they first saw each other , at La Guardia Airport , and about nine months after the trial ended out in Milwaukee a trial Marian knew little about , involving four young men in their twenties indicted for conspiracy to advocate resistance to induction into the United States Army . Of the four young men only one was well known , the folk singer Jacob Appleman , who was sentenced to three years in jail . Two others were given similar sentences . The youngest of the defendants , Robert Severin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and also at the time of his death , had been acquitted . No one knew why . Why was Severin acquitted ? people asked . Why Severin and no one else ? Quick , weasel-like , nervous , with something melancholic in his expression and in the thi moustache he had refused to shave off for th trial ; with a habit of raising his hand to hi mouth when he spoke , as if he distrusted h : own words or were ashamed of them . " I 'm ra going to shave it off . Frri nut going to inisrepri sent myself . I do n't lie , " he told his lawyer . H would n't remove the moustache and he wouldn dress properly and he would n't meet anyone eye , a lifelong habit of his , not even the eyes 4 his codefendants or of his lawyer , whom h father had retained for him . Severin was shot slender , dark , with a boyish frame and a shallo chest . He twisted his body as he sat , in sma uncoordinated movements , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trial I had squirmed in his scat , his heart acceleratii at strange times  --  especially during long di periods in which nothing seemed to be happe ing . Severin feared that something was real happening at these times , but that no one knew No one could guess . His heart had gradually i creased its beat until it was pounding like m during one forty-five-minute period when FBI agent , a stranger , talked about the size a colors and the texture of the paper and the ty of print involved in a pamphlet written by defendants and passed out to several thousa young men in Milwaukee , at an antiwar meetit Minutes and minutes passed as words were p nounced carefully by that man , that stranger courteous and handsome American in his ti ties , who spoke without any hatred or empha ... Listening to these simple , incredible wor Severin was afraid he would begin to scream . But he never screamed so that anyone co hear . The trial ended on the morning of March after the jury returned its verdict . Severin wall out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his parents , who had spent the four weeks of trial at a hotel in Milwaukee , or to the other fendants . He disappeared . He willed himself i disappearing . In his head for many days th had been a vision of himself disappearing , a 1 ing image on a screen , a slow fade-out at the t elusion of a movie . His mind flashed its thoughts like pictures on a reen , and one of the thoughts was Robert verin . Always alone . Walking somewhere sickly , alone . Since his boyhood he had imaged himself as a character in a film , a figure icing across a screen , blown up , enlarged , exagTated . He could be gigantic sometimes . He Lew this even if other people did not . At the e of fifteen he had reached his full growth : e foot seven inches . As if to show that he did . t mind being this short , he often stood with weight balanced on one leg , the other leg nt indifferently . He did not walk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " good pose . This was one of the things that annoyed his vyer . " It might be better not to slouch in urt , " his lawyer said gently . His name was ) rton Fisher and he was from New York , not isconsin , like the other attorneys ; but still verin did not trust him . Ile was a lawyer verin 's father had insisted upon . At first verin had been eager to talk to Fisher , to ex-Lin his life , but it turned out that Fisher was t really interested in his life . " We have to icentrate on what is relevant to your case , " her kept saying . Finally Severin understood , h a shock , that this man did not like him . He 3 hurt . And then he was bewildered , for why iuld n't this man like him ? Why should n't Tone like him ? Ile wanted only to do good and help others to do good . In the end , Severin dly spoke to Fisher . He sat with his shoulders wed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ich he had bought especially for this trial . It much too large for him , ill-cut , a parody of a : . He had told the salesman in the discount detment store that he wanted a baggy , old man 's " a joke of a suit , " a proper outfit in which night he tried by his government , which was Teased with him . Do you think that 's funny , that suit ? " his ter asked him . Everything is funny , " Severin said . Is that what you believe ? " No . I believe that nothing is funny , " Severin ' , in the same tone . " But we have to make ain pretenses . " Thy was Severin acquitted and no one else ? could hear everyone ask this question .

Robert Severin disappearing into . ky. ' hen he shut his eyes he could see quite prey a dark shape drawing into itself , wither-retreating into something that glowed ely , like the sun . Then it disappeared . That peace , that disappearing . that nullity . He would n't even have to argue or explain himself . He would have no need for words . Jr was n't until several weeks later that the three others received their sentences ; Severin read about it in a newspaper . By then he was in Montreal , where he knew no one . He stared at the photograph of Applernan Appleman with his bushy hair and glum , sardonic expression and his career " just beginning to catch on , " as people said  --  and Severin heard the voice in his head cry . I do n't know why Severin was acquitted , I do n't know why Severin was acquitted , I do n't know . He might have wanted to dissociate himself from Severin , with these words . An incantation : I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why . And he did not know why . He did not understand . His brain replayed for him those hours of the trial , the testimony of FBI agents and the testimony of witnesses and the level , reasoned arguing of the defense lawyers , who had all the dark-rimmed , glowing eyes of men drowning for a good cause , and the occasional snorts and interruptions of the judge , whose terrible eyes Severin had never quite seen . He knew that he was guilty , yet he had been found not guilty . He was as guilty as the others ; they were as innocent as he . Yet it had not turned out that way . He had tried to explain some of this to Marian Vernon , who had seemed to understand . " There was im difference between any of us , " he told her . His voice had rattled , accelerating . He had not talked for many weeks and now he could not stop . She had nodded , yes , yes , she understood or seemed to understand , staring in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like brother and sister . " That was how I figured out they had me marked for something special , " he told her angrily . " That 's why I have to get out of the country . / do n't have much time left . I 'm going to explode if I do n't get out . " Yes , yes , she had said , dumbly , but she had not really understood . Weeks and months after his death she went around saying she did n't understand , she did n't understand what he had wanted , why he had done it , why , why had it happened ? " Jesus , if I could relive that hour , " she said . She and Oberon talked about it all the time , talking about " it " as they embraced , closing their eyes upon a fast shocked image of Robert Severin 's face . He was a stranger and yet they were close to him , intimate . knowing . He was always with them . His enlarged face followed them everywhere and excited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; her love shriveled into something bitter and white-hot and she hated him , she snapped at him , You do n't know what it 's like to remember such a on red thing ? did you ever slip ed blood , yourself ? You do n't know what I know ! And he would take her in his arms , to quiet her . N 1ARIAN NEVER HAD TIME for newspapers , 1 never watched television , picked up important news and catastrophes from other people . Of course she had known nothing about the Milwaukee trial ; the name Jacob Appleman was familiar to her , but she had never heard any of his records . She was a young woman of twenty-two , a stewardess with Pan American Airways . She had graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Oklahoma , which qualified her for teaching in the elementary schools of that state , but she had never really planned on teaching . The company of children , other teachers , the confinement of a room and a single building  --  these things frightened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dark , wavy red , worn to her shoulders . Her face was lightly freckled , very healthy , her posture reflected health and enthusiasm , she had always been a happy child , a happy girl , arguing philosophically to herself that life was a wonderful adventure and that it should be faced with a constant smile . To a magazine reporter who had interviewed her in November she had confided , " That was how I got through that hour without cracking . I told myself that life is a wonderful adventure . I told myself that there is always a good , unexpected side to things , another arrangement we do n't know about immediately . " " And did that turn out to be true ? " the reporter asked . She paused . She lowered her eyes , thinking of Oberon . She said finally , " I ca n't tell you about that . " Oberon had known about the trial , which was always referred to as the " Appleman Case , " though three other men had been indicted . Oberon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's career since his first record , in 1965 , and he had been very disappointed at Appleman 's political activities  --  the organization of a series of anti war demonstrations in Chicago and Milwaukee . In his imagination he had even written Jacob Appleman a letter of warning . " My name is David Oberon and I am a stranger to you , yet believe me when l say that I wish you well . Why are you trying to destroy yourself ? Why are you trying to corrupt hundreds of young Americans ? Our country is engaged in a certain action in Southeast Asia and it is everyone 's duty to support his country ... . " But he did not dare type out this letter . This was in the fall of 1969 ; Appleman had not been arrested yet , but Oberon knew that the government was preparing a case against him . his letter might be confiscated . Even if he sent it anonymously it might be confiscated and traced back to him . Oberon had followed the case through the newspapers . He knew the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defendants , so the name " Robert Severin " was immediately fair iar to him . Severin had been the only pers. acquitted and people had wondered about th . Oberon himself had not wondered , believing tt the jury had wanted to free someone , just to c dare to the FBI and the Department of Justi that they could free a defendant who had prc ably been guilty of committing a crime agair the United States Government . It was a Introit ( act . He had heard , anyway , that Severin , t youngest of the four , had been indicted so ii : he could be acquitted  --  the government had h no interest in him , really . He explained this to Marian , who was rot sunny , cheerful by nature , a young Americ woman with a personality simple as slides shoe on a screen , one after another , and yet whc nature changed even as Oberon spoke to h as if he were teasing her with his words Severin , his superior knowledge of Sever drawing her out of herself in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're doing to me , " laughed . " You 're making me drunk . I feel ( inn Do n't stop talking . " " What else do you want to know ? " he ask her . She hesitated . " What it was like . " " What it was like . ? " " You know . What it felt like . To you . Whei happened . " He had fallen helplessly in love with her . H E WAS FOURTEEN YEARS OLDER than Mar Vernon , a tall , well-built man with brc hair , an amiable anonymous face , with soi thing courteous and predictable in his smile . was much taller than Robert Severin . If he 1 had the occasion to stand beside him , he wo have towered over him  --  poor Severin , with girlish weasel-like body , his narrow should ( H he had had the occasion to fight with him . could have picked him up and thrown him do knocking him senseless . Very deftly and cou ously he could have pinned Severin 's should down to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be arrested . Oberon sometimes thought of that . He thou , while he lay with Marian , of holding Sever squirming body down against the pavern Once he told her about it . " Like this , and this . . . like this ... I would have held down .. . " he whispered . They had lain toge face to face , solemn , grieving , and then on them had begun to laugh . Another time he ha told her what he was thinking of , but he sea that she too was thinking of Severin , alway Severin . " I love you , I love you , " she had sob as if arguing . Seen up close like this , Marian was a si beautiful woman . Drained of superficial em the friendly charity of her kind of woman , w Oberon had always detested , she was hollow , hungry , almost unmanageable . Her love for him obviously frightened her . It was so violent , so intense . he almost sympathized with her dread of it . What must a woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like that , he thought . No one knew Marian Vernon except him . When she appeared in that Pan American Airways uniform- when she smiled her mechanical little smile  --  it was a joke , a horror ! Only Oberon knew her . She brushed her hair back from her damp face , impatiently . A strand of her hair stung his eye . He tried to listen to what she was saying : something about his wife . " What does she know ? I saw her , that evening . Her . She does n't know . What do ordinary people know ? " " She can sense something . . . " " No . She ca n't . She would have to have been here , where I was . In my place . And she was n't here , no one else was there except me . . . You fool love her . Why do you stay with her ? " + They stared at each other . He was perspiring , Igitated , always he must stare at her in order o locate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardly knew , whom he did not really like . ' here was something coarse about her boldness iith him , her near-hysteria . She was younger - Lan his wife , more beautiful than his wife , and e was sick with love for her and yet he did not =ant to think about divorce , remarriage , the Duthie intensity of married life . " Do you love her ? " Marian asked . " No . It 's another emotion . " " Another emotion , yes . It 's ordinary . I do n't ant to hear about it . Ordinary people , ordinary gly people ... I do n't want to hear about them . " As soon as he left her she began to slip out of wus . She began to fade back into that neat smilig little stewardess with the uniform , the short drt , and tight-fitting , buttoned little jacket , with le hat perched cockily on her head . It fright-led him , that he might lose her . He might forget And yet he could not locate in his memory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of energy dominated them , gave them e ; it did not belong to either of them . Sometimes he went to stare at himself in a irror , at home or anywhere , in a public restom , but he saw only his public , unpersonal ce , which was like a uniform . It was like arian 's uniform . That face took him anywhere , . wn in by helicopter to the airport , with his .308 ) rma Magnum rifle . What did it feel like ? arian asked him , the first night they were to-then Did it have a kick ? I felt the kick myself . ' at it . I felt you . There was something anonyms and symmetrical about Oberon 's face . He d been annoyed , as a younger man , when nple were always coming up to him and calling n by the names of strangers  --  now it no longer thered him . He could have grown a moushe , like Severin . But he never did . He thought of himself as belonging to a crowd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagined , or collected for a special photograph : not a real crowd of unruly and ugly people , but an ideal crowd of " average " American men , fairly good-looking , of a certain height , in good health . Therefore he was six foot two inches tall . with short , wavy brown hair , a face that was almost handsome , with a strong clean nose and chin . His brown eyes looked ordinary and unalarming , but they were in fact extraordinary . His vision was perfect . He had always been proud of his eyesight . Eyes like muscles , tensing , erect , precise , fixing themselves on that stranger 's face , adjusting themselves to the face , getting to know it closely , intimately . . . The face had been framed by jumbled , spiky hair ; it had been partly hidden by sunglasses ; its skin was an eerie olive , pale and waxen and yet greasy , sagging with fatigue . The moustache had aged it . QEVEHIN HAD BOUGHT THE SUNGLASSES in a S drugstore north of Portland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sky glowed ; it reminded him of the sky in Milwaukee , that soulless glowering that had pressed upon him for so many months . Swollen gray sky and lake , remote , bulbous , inescapable ... He wanted to break through to a place where the sun shone . He bought the sunglasses for $1.98 and they looked like aviator 's glasses . with large lenses and wire frames . They were made of some synthetic material , not glass , a kind of plastic that did not break easily or even crack ; they were thrown a dozen yards from his body , and yet they did not break . Now for the approach : how to approach New York ? He had family there , parents . He feared his father and his father 's beaconlike face . It was n't enough loving them and then not loving them ; somehow they were mixed up with his childhood and the nation itself . Awake , unable to sleep , he began having little split-second dreams out on the highway  --  going crazy , eh , Severin ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out flat , the face stretched out like a big welcome mat , the bumpy hilly terrain of the United States , all someone 's face . That could be . Was n't there a movie about someone crawling across the faces at Mt . Rushmore ? Or had Severin imagined that movie ? Or was he an insect , himself , crawling across the face of his father , not able to put the various parts of the face together into a whole ? His night dreams did not work . Did not function properly . That was because he could n't sleep anymore at night , why bother getting a motel room if he could n't use the bed ? ? but even when he had been sleeping normally his dreams had not worked . How do dreams work ? What is their /unction ? " My dreams all dissolve and disappear , " he told his lawyer , Mr. Fisher . He had no one else to talk to ; by then he had quarreled with Appleman and the others , and their attorneys had quarreled with one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already won . A story in Look magazine implied that Appleman was a saint , but Severin knew better than that , everyone knew better than that , it was just journalistic crap and yet you could n't make your way through it : what would turn out to be true , what would turn out to be lies ? " Jesus , I ca n't get myself straight , when I try to think about something it all dissolves . Even my dreams ... My dreams just disappear , " he tried to explain to Fisher , who had pretended to be interested . " I do n't dream like other people , only pieces of dreams like jigsaw puzzles .... " After the verdict , Severin had walked away without saying goodbye . Not just his dreams but his bowels did n't work . Panic . Pain . Pain like fire . Sitting anxiously in the courtroom , fidgeting in his seat , he heard little of the testimony and fixed his gaze upon sterile , empty space , trying not to show the pain he felt . Small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had never screamed out loud . And now Severin will eradicate himself , he thought as he walked out of the courtroom and out of the courthouse . Severin walking fast , a comic figure . Almost running . During those four winter weeks his weight had dropped from 145 to 128 . His skin had grown so sensitive that he could not bear to be touched , and he could feel people breathing on him , he could feel the subtle but very abrasive touch of breath , air , against his skin . Appleman had a habit of gripping his arm , his elbow , as if to make sure Severin would n't get away . He hated Appleman 's Closeness , hated the feel of his breath . If he could get a table between them , good . He could n't make sense of Appleman 's nervous strategies and after a while he stopped listening . They were all guilty , anyway . That was one thing they had agreed upon . So he sat through the weeks of the trial , sensing how words flowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and yet never quite touching him . How they talked , these adults ... always talking , talking ... His lawyer would n't let him testify . None of the defendants was going to testify . All right , then , time would pass and nothing would matter , it was really completed , they were guilty and their punishment was beginning now , right now . That was why his bowels were turning to gas , poisonous rotting gas . That was why he could n't sleep . In court , already a prisoner at the front of the courtroom , he stared at a certain space in the room , not a person or an object but a space , an invisible point in the air , and tried to hypnotize himself into calmness , silence , into nothing . Otherwise , he might explode . Grappling with the stewardess , the redhead , he had felt the danger of his body colliding with hers : a danger for her , not for himself . " Do n't make me kill you , " he begged her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he , her face bleached out beneath her makeup . As soon as the plane left the runway he stood , stood out in the aisle , and took the rolled-up towel out of his coat . She Caine toward him , a woman perfectly balanced as in a dream , while around her faces turned and chins creased and outside the windows the jumbled landscape of small houses fell backward and down , in silence . " Do n't make me explode us all , " he begged . He had found the flare on a highway outside Montreal , he had laughed to see it so innocently left behind  --  it looked like a stick of dynamite ! Walking in the perpetual drizzle he had picked it up and hid it in his jacket , you never knew when you might need dynamite , also you never knew when you might need ' a knife . He had bought a knife in a sporting goods store in a small town somewhere . He could n't remember where , but probably someone had been watching him and knew . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with knives  --  you did n't " play with " knives in his family  --  but other boys had had knives and Severin had envied them . Now he had his own knife . And a flare that looked like dynamite . Maybe it was dynamite , It had a fuse that could be lit . The fuse was damp but perhaps it could still be lit . Outside Boston he took a motel room for a night , but he could n't sleep . A waste of six dollars . He found a newspaper and looked up the weather report : always raining . From Montreal down to New York : rain . He could n't remember where he was , exactly , but it was always raining a cold steady drizzle , and yet the sky was light Elie weather seemed to him very important . He lad stopped thinking about everything in his iast , and now he thought about the weather intead . There was a weather map of the United ; tales and also a very helpful list of temperatures n cities around the world . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Algiers was iissing . Why was it missing ? The FBI had reasons for everything . iN MONTREAL HE HAD BEEN SPIED ON he knew the feeling and did n't question it . But he had of cared . He walked in the street , up and down te hilly streets , openly . It was a foreign country - Canada  --  and he was free here . In fact , he was ? ee anywhere . Even in Milwaukee . He sent himilf back to Milwaukee , that raw freezing ugly ty , to the courtroom , to see if Robert Severin as still sitting there , yes , there he was , the size a boy , pretending to listen while words flooded s head . Yes , he was guilty . Did n't he love his irents ? Did he want to destroy his mother ? Oh ss . No . Did he want to destroy himself ? The first was dropping out of law school , his father id pointed that out to him . The first step toward 1f-destruction . And this Appleman , who was ppieman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , blindly ? " his father deanded . The irony was that Appleman envied arerin and the others because they had gone college while he , Appleman , so wealthy and nervous , had barely managed to graduate from gh school ; but Severin did n't bother to tell his her that . Was he guilty of certain lies ? Of oiding certain statements ? Guilty of a small uninly body ? The young man he had shared an artment with near Columbia , a twenty-eightar-old veteran of the Vietnam war and , like verin , a law student , had flown out to MilwauD to testify for him . Very serious , very moral . a completely moral person We had little common and we were n't friends , no , but I ad-red Bob for his honesty . . . . Yet , when the irteous businesslike prosecutor had cross-exined him , he had faltered and said , Yes , Rob absolutely honest and he would never commit r crime , I mean any dishonest crime . . . . Any honest crime ! Severin himself had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of crap and he knew what was what . Any dislest crime ! It 's a strange distinction for a mg man entering the law , the prosecutor had gently , with a smile , as if a little embarrassed the witness , the division of crimes into honest dishonest crimes . . everin had stopped listening . ' he jury spent ten hours discussing the case , when they came back Severin stood for n , in honor of them , " at attention , " in a par-of a young man in a green-gray tweed suit ; ding at attention in a courtroom , his face composed for a smirk and his bowels churning with flame and lava . Bastards ! Bland faces and frank honest souls ! Mr. Foreman , how say you ? Is Jacob Apple-man , the defendant at the bar , guilty or not guilty ? Guilty . Is John Harvey , the defendant at the bar , guilty or not guilty ? Guilty . Is Russell Kurzon , the defendant at the bar , guilty or not guilty ? Guilty . Is Robert Severin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guilty ? Not guilty . Not guilty . So he sent himself out of there , on a Greyhound bus up to Montreal . He was free He had money . His father was always giving him money , for good nourishing food and for good hotel rooms . He tried to sleep on the bus but his skull seemed too large for his brain . His brain slipped wetly around inside the bone case , an unpleasant sensation . Were his thoughts dissolving , turning to poisonous intestinal vapors ? They kept slipping , slithering , out of his grasp . He had to rely upon flashes of dreams in the daylight ; that was where he got his best hunches from . He telephoned home just once , collect , from a telephone booth that looked over and up to McGill University , buildings and grounds and university students so normal and handsome that he wanted to cry , his nose ran with envy and he could barely pay attention to his conversation with his father . . . " Bob ? Bob ? Is that you , Bob @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father had shouted across the distance . It was terrible to hear his voice . Severin changed his mind , he did n't want a father again , why had n't he remembered what it was like ? He hung up . Anyway the telephone was probably wiretapped . " It is not necessary for the accused to have done anything , " someone was explaining to the jury . It was the judge himself . He was the most adult of all the adults . " In a case like this , the prosecution has only to prove that they agreed to do something . The case rests entirely on intent and you must find the defendants guilty or not guilty according to their intent .... " He intended now to blow up the country . He intended to fly up into the sun , to clean himself in the sun , to escape the rain of the East Coast . Why did it rain so often ? And on clear days his head ached ; he muttered in disgust , Severin , you 're going crazy . Why else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pocket , a kid 's jackknife with three blades in your pocket ? Oh it was a joke , like the green suit . People took him too seriously . Adults took him too seriously . Out in Milwaukee  --  maybe in the whole Midwest or the whole country  --  people thought that the White House might be blown up just because Severin or someone with a moustache like his did not throw his shoulders back and blew his nose at the wrong lime , into a soiled Kleenex . The sunglasses helped his burning eyes but really they were part of the joke . You could n't disguise yourself , of course . The FBI had cameras that X-rayed you antiseptically as you walked in the street . You could n't hide from them ; therefore , you joked in a mild and cavalier way with them . " You do n't joke with these people , " Fisher had told him angrily , as if speaking to a child . " What do you think this is ? A game ? " It turned out that all the defendants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joke nervously with the men who brought them . Tried to establish a quick jocular rapport with the lewlevel FBI men who questioned them , as if that would help . Would n't it help ? A quick jocular alliance against the hierarchy , the Rulers . Would n't it help ? " No , you do n't talk . You do n't cooperate . You do n't try to win their good favor . They are out to get you whether you can believe it or not . The government is out to get you ... Do you think that 's a joke ? " It was so hard to believe , so hard to believe , that anyone wanted to hurt them , even the government they had dared to arrest them . The government turned out to be men who looked like Severin 's father and his lawyer ; that is , good citizens , well dressed and polite . Of course , they hated the government and had accused the government of being fascistic , in their speeches , even in their televised speeches , but somehow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FBI agents and their attorneys and the prosecutor , reall wanted to hurt them . . . Like most American Severin believed that he could make anyone lik him , if he tried . lie had never been popular , i high school or college , but lie had always the ished the belief that he could be popular , if f worked at it . T FrIIIE STEWARDESS HAD SMILED AT HIM , her sticked lips baring her teeth in a ski numbed grimace , the two of them staring at ea ( other levelly , the same height . He had felt like brother to her . She was one of those pretty , si terly girls so popular in high school , grinnii hello to everyone in the halls , absolutely co fident and shadow less . " I do n't want to kill you he had whispered . " Take me up front . Let n explain myself to the pilot . Let me explain at you can see how clear everything will be . " " Yes , I 'll take you . Do n't be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm not going to hurt you , anyone , unless I have to . I 'm very calm , " Sever said . Severin gripped her close . The pilot had title : Captain . He was a man who resembled o of the other defense lawyers . Severin saw at or that this man was intelligent and would play tricks on him : were the lives of fifty passengl worth any risk ? No . It was logical . You re about it in the newspapers all the time . Yet son thing in the back of Severin 's head told hi What a joke this is , now , what a laugh ! Are really on this plane ? Or still back in Montr ( dreaming a daylight dream ? " My destination Algeria , " Severin stated , " I am defecting . I demanding diplomatic immunity . " But on the turnpike leaving Boston , had walked slowly along for several hoi before someone stopped . It was an FBI agent an ordinary car . He joked with the man kn ( ingly , delicately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a kind of fence with them , teasing the This man claimed to be a publisher 's represer tive . Sevcrin laughed and said , " Which publi ers ? Name one . " The man did give a familiar name . " I 'm the college department . Textbooks . Are yoi college student ? " " Ha ha , " Severin said . " Are you offering inc scholarship if I turn over all the evidence would n't mind going back to law school . " " I do n't understand , " the man said slowly " No , never mind . It 's just a joke . I 'm on way out of the country , I 'm just going to goodbye to my funnily . " " Where does your family live ? " Severin glanced at the man , sizing him ui big man , like all of them . If it came to a f he 'd have to use his elbows and feet , to para the bastard . He would n't want to use the kr then it would be murder . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They rarely touched you . Thy should they ? " New York , " Severin said . He felt helpless , 11ing the truth like this ; but when they already new the truth you had no choice but to say it . JE PITT ON HIS SUNGLASSES , carefully , hook-. ' ing them behind his ears . The earpieces made of wire and quite pliable . When arian Vernon looked into his face for the first ne -- welcoming him frankly on board the plane - she did not see him . She did not remember sing him . But after the take-off , when he imbled to his feet and opened his oversized at , she looked at him again and this time she w him . Out of his baggy green suit coat he drew a tile towel , rolled up , and he unrolled it to show r a stick of dynamite . Mutely he raised it to r , his eyebrows arching . They walked together the front of the plane . She felt his breath on back of her neck , so close . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I n't like knives and this is the first knife I ever light , " he told her earnestly . She glanced back see that he had a knife in his hand . She went d . I went cold . The dynamite I could n't be- , e in , it was so . .. so extreme ? . . But the knife 5 just the right size ... But he was very polite , y nice to me ... No . I was n't afraid . I went I was numb and like a robot , but 1 was n't xid . I would have been afraid to do what Mr. eron did ... lbw really took courage . You do n't resent the FBI risking your life , n ? " they asked her . ' Oh , no . No . I do n't consider it that , that they ed my life . I mean , it was their job . It was Oberon 's job . He was given orders . It was done very carefully . I had faith in them . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was n't afraid . " How close did he stay to you ? " Oh , very close . He held me from behind , my . His fingers were very tight around my arm , upper arm , and he kept asking me if he was ing me , he was very polite and did n't talk , he was sort of short , no taller than I was , all along I could feel the knife in my back . a fingernail , a man 's fingernail . . . He ted to go to Algeria , he said . Something it the sun . He was tired of rain . The Captain him , of course , this plane was headed for eland and it was n't a transatlantic plane and wanted that he would have to wait . . " end did he believe that ? " ) 11 , yes , he believed that , at once . He was polite and apologetic about hurting me. " by are you working with planes ? Severin I her . This is no job for a woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disintegrate in ky She seemed to be listening to him , fly . She nodded . He could see a droplet of perspiration on her forehead . She was a pretty young woman , like a sister , so pretty , so eager to please him , docile and not argumentative as he had feared she might be . . . The sky is for men , it 's dangerous . After this you should stay on the ground . Are you listening ? Oh yes I 'm listening , yes I 'm listening . . . The other passengers had filed out . Severin stood with her just inside the door , at the top of the ramp , squinting out into the drizzle . Someone was speaking to him through a loudspeaker . But the loudspeaker did not work very well . " Where is that plane ? That big plane ? I 'm waiting for it , " he yelled out into the rain . He held the stewardess back against him , an embrace and yet not an embrace ; it was an impersonal embrace . Minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed and could not be retrieved . He saw a large jetliner being moved toward him , far away in the rain , and then he wondered if he had seen correctly . Would they give him a pilot and a crew ? All that expense , just for him ? " You might like Algeria , yourself , " he told the girl . " There , you could stay on the ground and forget about all this crap , this fooling around . You could stay there with me . " " You wo n't hurt me ? " " I do n't want to hurt you . " " When will you let me go ? " " In Algeria . " They were calling to him : the plane is ready , the crew is ready . He saw the plane but it was some distance away . " Closer , bring it closer ! Do n't you hear me ? " he yelled . The little knife with one blade stuck out , pressed against the girl 's back . Against the uni-form . His face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He breathed in and out , against the back of her neck . Her ear . He said , " I do n't want to hurt you or kill you , I 'm not in favor of violence or blood ... Tell them to bring that plane closer . " She cupped her hands to her mouth and tried to call to them . but she could not speak . He heard a sob from her . I thought I would break down , then , and that he would kill me , just slide the knife in me because he was disgusted She sobbed , her shoulders shook ; he relented and said , " All right , forget it , let 's go . Let 's go . " Stiffly he walked her down the ramp . She nearly slipped and he held her steady , his lingers tightening around her arm . She cried out with the surprise of it , the pain . He knew that people were watching him , from inside the hangars and from behind the steel fences ; perhaps a camera crew was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a television screen . An image of Robert Severin walked across a screen , jerkily , streaks of rain on the camera lens . It would be so realistic . He could see his own figure , holding the stewardess tight against the front of him , walking her clown the ramp carefully , stiffly , Robert Severin in his dirty , baggy suit wearing his aviator 's sunglasses as if he were prepared for the sun of Algeria , his hair hunched and spiky from not having been washed for a month . Robert Severin centered on a screen . Robert Severin centered in a telescopic sight . At the bottom of the ramp the girl slipped and stumbled two steps down , to the pavement . She turned as if to apologize to him and at that moment there was a shot . Severin jerked backward against the steps , away from her . Then another shot . His face exploded : she was looking up into his face when it exploded . It was as if something had been thrown against his face , an object stuffed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was pouring from him . Did she hear him scream ? Any sound at all ? She caught the fullness of his weight as he fell , his body gone heavy , the blood gushing from him and onto her . She fell , she tried to get to her feet , screaming , but she slipped in his blood , she slipped to her knees and then pushed herself up , frantic to get away , to get away . I thought I was shot , mysel f. l thought we were both shot . Does this alter your plans ? ? your plans for a career ? Oh no . No . You 'll have something to tell your grandchildren , wo n't you ? Oh yes . What do you think of the FBI man who did the shooting ? She studied the photographs in that evening 's newspaper : a picture of herself , two microphones extended to her , her face looking goodenough , even her hair good enough ; and a picture of the man at the steel wall , aiming , his rifle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held the gun so firmly , so certainly ... Other men stood below him , watching . They seemed such ordinary men . They watched him and he leaned over the wall , his back to them , aiming the rifle and peering through the scope , staring at her and Severin through the scope ... And yet neither she nor Severin had known about the rifle ! She marveled at this , tracing with her forefinger her own face and then the outline of the FBI man 's body and the rifle , aimed out of the picture , at that face of hers . Past her face . Over her shoulder and into Scverin 's face . It was so confusing , so hard to think about .. Powerfully , she felt the blow again : Severin slammed back front her , against the steps of the ramp . She had slipped on the wet steps . And then the shot , then the second shot . How she loved him ! " Tell me what you felt , " she said . " I had the idea that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back through the scope , " he said . " Did you ? Did it seem as though I was watch ing you ? What did I look like ? " " Very beautiful , " he said . " ' Was I beautiful ? Was I ? Even in the rain even after that hour with him ? Was I beautifu to you ? " " Yes , you were beautiful ... For fifteen min utes I was watching you , you and him . You , had never seen a face like yours ... " " Were you afraid ? " " No.I took my time . I knew how it would tur out . I had only to wait for the right moment , i order to make it turn out that way . As soon s they flew me in , as soon as I got propped up o that wall , lie was a dead man . But it took a whi " to kill him . " " Did you ever kill anyone before ? " " Never an American . " With his deer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the first shot catching hi squarely in the chest , the second shot squarely the face , Excellent shots . For ten , fifteen mi utes he had watched through the sight , hard breathing , waiting patiently . He had been Oa his orders . Ah , that girl ! That white gasping fa of hers ! The boy had bounced back . Blood had spru : out of his face , like an exclamation . One day Oberon sought her out , rang the do , bell to her apartment . He introduced himself . 1 heard her breathing , inside the door , a f inches away . Silence . " You know who I am , " said . He was very excited ; there was even an 0 ( about him , of intense excitement . The girl ste inside her door , which was latched with a saf , lock , a chain , and he brought his smiling face the crack in the door so that he could look at h She was staring up at him . " You know why I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
