CALUCCI 'S DEPT . CBS . Friday , 8-8:30 p.m . E.D.T. New York Stage and Film Actor James Coco ( Last of the Red Hot Lovers ) has the mournfully expressive eyes of a wise old beagle and the roundly appealing face of an anemone in full flower . As Calucci , the head of a local unemployment office , he mobilizes these attributes to create a sweet and believable character who does not need the script 's occasional overkill in what the trade calls " heart " scenes . Samples : an oh-so-wistful , what's-life-all-about dialogue in a confessional in the first episode ; a painfully prolonged avowal of friendship for Co-Star Jos Perez in another . The infectiously funny Perez , as one of Calucci 's handful of oddball employees , is the show 's second asset . He is a perfect foil for Coco 's brand of gentle humor , and steals a star 's share of the laughs himself with his ongoing search for " the Puerto Rican dream " - cars , girls , silk socks , " a big house overlooking San @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cantinflas . " It 's a nice show . <P> ADAM 'S RIB . ABC . Friday , 9:30-10 p.m . E.D.T. Adam ( Ken Howard ) is an assistant D.A. , and his wife Amanda ( Blythe Danner ) is also a lawyer , and the very thin rib is Women 's Lib . At least that is what seems to have been intended in this half-hour comedy purportedly inspired by the 1949 classic Spencer Tracy-Katharine Hepburn film of the same name . But the first two episodes did little to advance the cause . In the premire , the woman lawyer was so emotionally shattered by having to spend a single night in the clink that she could not open her mouth in court the next day . ( Hubby came to the rescue , naturally . ) The next week she " proved " her right to wear a pantsuit into a fancy Los Angeles restaurant ( a right won long ago by other pantsuited Angelenos ) by forcing her husband to wear a dress at the office . The only thing that has really been liberated is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call one another " Pinkie " or worse . In one episode , when She demands that they talk lawyer-to-lawyer , he says " Could n't we just talk poopsie to poopsie ? " <P> LOTSA LUCK . NBC . Monday , 8-8:30 p.m . E.D.T. Archie Bunker has spawned a whole blue-collar barrelful of hopeful imitators , but this one has scraped the bottom . In yet another American translation of an English television comedy , Dom DeLuise is a former bus driver who now mans his company 's lost and found department . Whatever he gives at the office , he spends most of his time at home exchanging nastiness with his family of carping harpies . The biggest household joke seems to be the sexual inability of his sullen and slovenly brother-in-law Arthur , although last week Mom 's hot flashes and the laxative nature of sister 's cooking came in for their share of yucks . NBC announced last week that henceforth there will be more " warmth " written into these plug-uglies , and in an unusual step , aired two segments of the show . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came four days later , following top-rated Sanford and Son , to give all those Sanford fans " a look at the totally new direction the show is taking . " Lotsa luck .
