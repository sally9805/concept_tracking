a story by Alice Walker EI/ERYDAY USE A legacy for the child who will live it I WILL WAIT FOR TIER in the yard that Maggie and I made so clean and wavy yesterday afternoon . A yard like this is more comfortable than most people know . It is not just a yard . It is like an extended living room . When the hard clay is swept clean as a floor and the fine sand around the edges lined with tiny , irregular grooves , anyone can come and sit and look up into the elm tree and wait for the breezes that never come inside the house . Maggie will be nervous until after her sister goes : she will stand hopelessly in corners , homely and ashamed of the burn scars down her arms and legs , eyeing her sister with a mixture of envy and awe . She thinks her sister has held life always in the palm of one hand , that " no " is a word the world never learned to say to her . You 've no doubt seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it " is confronted , as a surprise , by his own mother and father , tottering in weakly from backstage . ( A pleasant surprise , of course : what would they do if parent and child came on the show only to curse out and insult each other ? ) On TV mother and child embrace and smile into each other 's faces . Sometimes the mother and father weep , the child wraps them in his arms and leans across the table to tell how he would not have made it without their help . I have seen these programs . Sometimes I dream a dream in which Dee and I are suddenly brought together on a TV program of this sort . Out of a dark and soft-seated limousine I am ushered into a bright room filled with many people . There I meet a smiling , gray , sporty man like Johnny Carson who shakes my hand and tells me what a fine girl I have . Then we are on the stage and Dee is embracing me with tears in her eyes . She pins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has told inc once that she thinks orchids are tacky flowers . In real life I am a large big-boned woman with rough , man-working hands . In the winter I wear flannel nightgowns to bed and overalls during the day . I can kill and clean a hog as mercilessly as a man . My fat keeps me hot in zero weather . I can work outside all day , breaking ice to get water for washing ; I can eat pork liver cooked over the open fire minutes after it comes steaming from the hog . One winter I knocked a bull calf straight in the brain between the eyes with a sledgehammer and had the meat hung up to chill before nightfall . But of course all this does not show on television . I am the way my daughter would want me to be ; a hundred pounds lighter , my skin like an uncooked barley pancake . My hair glistens in the hot bright lights , Johnny Carson has much to do to keep up with my quick and witty tongue . But that is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Who ever knew a Johnson with a quick tongue ? Who can even imagine me looking a strange white man in the eye ? It seems to me I have talked to them always with one foot raised in flight , with my head turned in whichever way is farthest from them . Dee , though . She would always look anyone in the eye . Hesitation was no part of her nature . 11 OW DO I LOOK , MAMA ? " Maggie says , showing just enough of her thin body enveloped in pink skirt and red blouse for me to know she 's there almost hidden by the door . " Come out into the yard , " I say . Have you ever seen a lame animal , perhaps a dog run over by some careless person rich enough to own a car , sidle up to someone who is ignorant enough to be kind to him ? That is the way my Maggie walks . She has been like this , chin on chest , eyes on ground , feet in shuffle , ever since the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dee is lighter than Maggie , with nicer hair and a fuller figure . She 's a woman now , though sometimes I forget . How long ago was it that the other house burned ? Ten , twelve years ? Sometimes I can still hear the flames and feel Maggie 's arms sticking to me , her hair smoking and her dress falling off her in little black papery flakes . her eyes seemed stretched open , blazed open by the flames reflected in them . And Dee . I see her standing off under the sweetgum tree she used to dig gum out of ; a look of concentration on her face as she watched the last dingy gray board of the house fall in toward the red-hot brick chimney . Why do n't you do a dance around the ashes ? I 'd wanted to ask her . She had hated the house that much . I used to think she hated Maggie too . But that was before we raised the money , the church and me , to send her to Augusta to school . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lies , other folks ' habits , whole lives upon us two , sitting trapped and ignorant underneath her voice . She washed us in a river of make-believe , burned us with a lot of knowledge we did n't necessarily need to know . Pressed us to her with the serious way she read , to shove us away , like dimwits , at just the moment we seemed about to understand . Dee wanted nice things . A yellow organdy dress to wear to her graduation from high school ; black pumps to match a green suit she 'd made from an old suit somebody gave me . She was determined to stare down any disaster in her efforts . Her eyelids would not flicker for minutes at a time . Often I fought off the temptation to shake her . At sixteen she had a style of her own : and knew what style was . I never had an education myself . After second grade the school was closed down . Do n't ask me why : in 1927 colored asked fewer questions than they do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along good-naturedly but ca n't see well . She knows she is not bright . Like good looks and money , quickness passed her by . She will marry John Thomas ( who has mossy teeth in an earnest face ) , and then be free to sit here and I guess just sing church songs to myself . Although I never was a good singer . Never could carry a tune . I was always better at a man 's job . I used to love to milk till I was hooked in the side in ' 49 . Cows are soothing and slow and do n't bother you , unless you try to milk them the wrong way . I have deliberately turned my back on the house . It is three rooms , just like the one that burned , except the roof is tin ; they do n't make shingle roofs anymore . There are no real windows , just some holes cut in the sides , like the portholes in a ship , but not round and not square , with rawhide holding the shutters up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , like the other one . No doubt when Dee sees it she will want to tear it down . She wrote me oncethat no matter where we " choose " to live , she will manage to come see us . But she will never bring her friends . Maggie and I thought about this and Maggie asked me , " Mama , when did Dee ever have any friends ? " She had a few . Furtive boys in pink shirts hanging about on washday after school . Nervous girls who never laughed . Impressed with her they worshipped the well-turned phrase , the cute shape , the scalding humor that erupted like bubbles in lye . She read to them . When she was courting Jimmy ' I ' she did n't have much time to pay to us , but turned all her fault-finding power on him . He flew to marry a cheap city girl from a family of ignorant flashy people . She hardly had time to recompose herself . Maggie attempts to make a dash for the house , in her shuffling way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Come back here , " I say . And she stops and tries to dig a well in the sand with her toe . It is hard to see them clearly through the strong sun . But even the first glimpse of leg out of the car tells me it is Dee . Her feet were always neat looking , as if Cod himself had shaped them with a certain style . From the other side of the car comes a short , stocky man . hair is all over his head a foot long and hanging from his chin like a kinky mule tail . I hear Maggie suck in her breath . " Uhnnnh , " is what it sounds like . Like when you see the wriggling end of a snake just in front of your foot on a road . " Uhnnnh . " Dee , next . A dress down to the ground , in this hot weather . A dress so loud it hurts my eyes . There are yellows and oranges enough to throw back the light of the sun . I feel my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Earrings gold too , and hanging down to her shoulders . Bracelets dangling and making noises when she moves her arm up to shake the folds of the dress out of her armpits . The dress is loose and flows , and as she walks closer , I like it . I hear Maggie go " Uhnnnh " again . It is her sister 's hair . It stands straight up like the wool on a sheep . It is black as night and around the edges are two long pigtails that rope about like small lizards disappearing behind her ears . " Wa-su-zo-Tean-o ! " she says , coming on in that gliding . way the dress makes her move . The short stocky fellow with the hair to his navel is all grinning and he follows up with , " Asalamalakim , my mother and sister ! " He moves to hug Maggie but she falls back , right up against the back of my chair . I feel her trembling there , and when I look up I see the perspiration falling off her skin . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am stout it takes something of a push . You can see me sinks ; you could see where thumbs and fingers had sunk into the wood . It was beautiful light yellow wood , from a tree that grew in the yard where Big Dee and Stash had lived . After dinner Dee ( Wangero ) went to the trunk at the foot of my bed and started rifling through it . Maggie hung back in the kitchen over the dishpan . Out came Wangero with two quilts . They had been pieced by Grandma Dee , and then Big Dee and me had hung them on the quilt frames on the front porch and quilted them . One was is the Lone Star pattern . The other was Walk Around the Mountain . In both of them were scraps of dresses Grandma Dee had worn fifty and more years ago . Bits and pieces of Grandpa Jarrell 's paisley shirts . And one teeny faded blue piece , about the size of a penny matchbox , that was from Great Grandpa Ezra 's uniform that he wore in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweet as a bird . " Can I have these old quilts ? " I heard something fall in the kitchen , and a minute later the kitchen door slammed . " Why do n't you take one or two of the others ? " I asked . " These old things was just done by me and Big Dee from some tops your grandma pieced before she died . " " No , " said Wangero . " I do n't want those . They are stitched around the borders by ma-chine . " " That 'll make them last better , " I said . " That 's not the point , " said Wangero . " These are all pieces of dresses Grandma used to wear . She did all this stitching by hand . Imagine ! " She held the quilts securely in her arms , stroking them . " Some of the pieces , like those lavender ones , come from old clothes her mother handed down to her , " I said , moving up to touch the quilts . Dee ( Wangero ) moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quilts . They already belonged to her . " Imagine ! " she breathed again , clutching them closely to her bosom . " The truth is , " I said , " I promised to give them quilts to Maggie , for when she marries John Thomas . " She gasped , like a bee had stung her . " Maggie ca n't appreciate these quilts ! " she said . " She 'd probably be backward enough to put them to everyday use . " " I reckon she would , " I said . " God knows I been saving'em for long enough with nobody using ' em . I hope she will ! " I did n't want to bring up how I had offered Dee ( Wangero ) a quilt when she went away to college . Then she had told me they were old-fashioned , out of style . " But they 're priceless ! " she was saying now , furiously ; for she has a temper . " Maggie would put them on the bed and in five years they 'd be in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always make some more , " I said . " Maggie knows how to quilt . " Dee ( Wangero ) looked at me with hatred . " You just will not understand . The point is these quilts , these quilts ! " " Well , " I said , stumped , " what would you do with them ? " " Hang them , " she said . As if that was the only thing you could do with quilts . M AGGIE , BY NOW , WAS STANDING in the door . I could almost hear the sound her feet made as they scraped over each other . " She can have them , Mama , " she said , like somebody used to never winning anything , of having anything reserved for her . " I can ' member Grandma Dee without the quilts . " I looked at her hard . She had filled her bottom Iip with checkerberry snuff , and it gave her face a kind of dopey , hangdog look . It was Grandma Dee and Big Dee who taught her how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hidden in the folds of her skirt . She looked at her sister with something like fear , but she was n't mad at her . This was Maggie 's portion . This was the way she knew God to work . When I looked at her like that something hit me in the top of my head and ran down to the soles of my feet . Just Eke when I 'm in church and the spirit of God touches me and I get happy and shout . I did something I never had done before : hugged Maggie to me , then dragged her on into the room , snatched the quilts out of Miss Wangero 's hands and dumped them into Maggie 's lap . Maggie just sat there on my bed with her mouth open . " Take one or two of the others , " I said to Dee . But she turned without a word and went out to Hakim-a-barber. xr Orr JUST DO N'T I:NDERSTAND , " she said , as I Maggie and I came out to the car . " What do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Your heritage , " she said . And then she turned to Maggie , kissed her , and said , " You ought to try to make something of yourself too , Maggie . It 's really a new day for us . But from the way you and Mama still live you 'd never know it . " She put on some sunglasses that hid everything above the tip of her nose and her chin . Maggie smiled ; maybe at the sunglasses . But a real smile , not scared . After we watched the car dust settle I asked Maggie to bring me a dip of snuff . And then the two of us sat there just enjoying , until it was time to go in the house and go to bed . ?
