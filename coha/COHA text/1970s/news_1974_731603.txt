txt " IT 'S REALLY hard on the children . They do n't know what the strike 's all about and when they see other kids with nice things , they ca n't understand why they ca n't have them . " Mrs. Connie Biggins , a widowed grandmother , never dreamed that when she walked off her job with nearly 1,600 other strikers last July 1 at the CPC International Inc. ' s corn products plant in suburban Summit that she and the others would still be off their jobs nearly four months later . She and her daughter have had to support themselves and five of Mrs. Biggins ' grandchildren on the $25-a-week strike benefits they earn for doing small chores at the union strike headquarters . Mrs. Biggins mid thousands of other workers thruout the country are victims of the failure of bargaining machinery to settle labor-manJack illabley 's column is on page 1 . agement disputes without unleashing the ultimate weapon  --  a costly strike or lockout . THE HARDSHIPS prolonged strikes cause the individual working man and woman often are obscured by cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Both labor and management seem to agree that strikes are an outmoded tool of resolving disputes , creating more problems than they cure , but the machinery assembled to avoid strikes often does n't seem to work either . The strike in Summit is an example of both difficulties . Few labor or industry sources envision any significant changes in the near future in collective bargaining processes . As a result unions are approving higher strike funds from members ' paychecks and industry continues to think in terms of costly stockpiling and other strategy to resist workers ' demands . The strike that closed the plant in Summit was the result of a vote by the Oil , Chemical and Atomic Workers , AFL-CIO , whose : 3,300 members voted overwhelmingly to strike CPC International plants in Summit and Pekin , Ill. , Kansas City , Mo. , and Corpus Christi . Tex . The CPC International strike is now nearly four months old and altho workers admitted there was no way to salvage their financial losses suffered in the strike , they voted overwhelmingly in a recent secret ballot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wages and fringe benefits spread over a two-year period . BEFORE the strike , workers were paid an average of $5.20 an hour , according to union officials . Based on straight-time for a five-day week , the loss to workers has been more than $4,000 in wages alone . " We thought the strike would only last two or three weeks , " remarked Mrs. Jessie Morales , who worked alongside her husband in the Summit plant . " We 're all shocked by this . People are hurting . They may lose their homes and their cars . " Charles Mason , 5805 S. Laflin St. , said he had put in all tile overtime he could before the strike to put together a savings plan . " I 'm behind $489.44 on the house payments . I just got tile final notice on the light bill , and I had to borrow to keep up the payment on the gas . " My wife is pregnant and the doctor said because of a history of miscarriages she ca n't work . We 've got plenty of problems and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have seen savings wiped out and look to friends and relatives for handouts or loans to carry them over , " There 's no one but myself and it 's hard to meet the bills , " said Pauline Calvert , a widow . " I really had no savings before the strike . I get a little help from my four children , but they 're married and are having their own problems making ends meet . " Negotiations between leaders of tile Oil , Chemical and Atomic Workers union and CPC International have been carried out under the auspices of the Federal Mediation Service , but the mediation service is handcuffed by the extent of its authority . Mediators can not force either side to meet , much less arbitrate and decide outstanding issues in a dispute . However , the mediation service often has effectively brought pressure to forestall strikes and to assist negotiators for both sides in reaching amicable settlements . THE CPC INTERNATIONAL strike in itself is not enough to cause a furor over the breakdown in labor-management relations . But , coupled with the losses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other prolonged industrial strife Himont the nation , including the possibility of a mine workers ' strike next month , both unions and management may be forced to seek settlement procedures short of the strike and lockout . The first major breakthru came with an agreement between the nation 's major steel producers and the United Steelworkers of America , AFL-CIO , in which the union pledged ; there would be no nationwide steel strike or the threat of one thru 1980 . To accept the idea the workers won a $150 bonus as well as a guaranteed minimum 3-percent-a-year wage hike with the total increases depending on the rate of inflation and other factors . The move eliminated the " scare " buying of steel for stockpiles in advance of contract expirations . Under the old procedure , thousands faced layoffs even if an agreement were reached before a strike because steel demand dropped while users consumed massive stockpiles . : ; ' , Tho the agreement guaranteed peace in the Steel industry thru 1980 and protects against - massive layoffs of workers , some dissident ; anion members tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officials , including +I ; W. Abel , steelworkers ' president . AFL-CIO President George Meany Insists the ' Strike is outmoded but clings to his position that organized labor should never relinquish its right to strike . " We are paying the price of success , " Meany once explained to reporters . " And the penalty of success is viten you strike you got a helluva lot more to lose . " You take a guy getting $10,000 a year , he 's trying to send a kid to college , maybe two . kids . And , maybe he 's got a second-hand car for himself , and maybe he is trying to pay off on a little home . " Well , you put him-on strike . You 've got a helluva lot greater problem to try to keep him alive than you had 25 years ago when you put him on strike when he was getting 80 cents an hour , " Meany explained . ' In 1972 President Nixon established the Industrial Peace Commission , composed of union and business leaders and top ranking government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machinery and to prevent strikes . FEW PERSONS close to labor pinned any hopes on any workable plan to emerge from the commisission . Asked a year later if he expected any substantial results Meany said , " I 've been on more .. Presidential committees than any man now alive , according to some fellow who made a study of it , and I have seen very , very few of them that have ever come up with anything . You can commission things to death . " Meany was essentially correct . After three or four meetings , the commission wrote a brief report urging more authority and more financial and other support of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service , but , at the same time , stressed its opposition to any form of compulsory arbitration or legislative restriction on current collective bargaining practices . During 1973 an estimated 5,600 strikes began , the third largest number on record , according to the U.S. Labor Department 's Bureau of Labor Statistics . In this period 2.2 million workers were idled and 27 million man-days lost because of work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duration of stoppages was 12.3 days a worker , the lowest level since 1961 . Altho the number of peaceful settlements reached each year dwarf the number of strikes , it offers little comfort to the worker or the employer economically crushed by the prolonged strike or lockout.
