txt Nearly $100,000 paid by Abbott Laboratories of North Chicago since 1963 for space it rents at County hospital and for the use of hospital facilities and full-time employes has been diverted into the bank account of a private organization , THE TRIBUNE learned yesterday . Hospital officials maintain that none of the money has been turned over to the hospital or the county government , thereby forcing County to pay for the overhead and services of the drug company 's research program . The diversion of the Abbott funds , in effect , causes the taxpayer to subsidize the firm 's research program at the hospital . Hektoen Gets Money The money is paid to the Hektoen institute , a private nonprofit organization which administers research grants at the hospital . The institute occupies rent-free offices in County 's laboratory building at 629 S. Wood st . The money paid by Abbott is in two forms , a $10,000-a-year rental fee for 693 square feet of space it uses in medical building B and additional thousands of dollars paid for blood tests and biochemical tests performed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Samuel J. Hoffman , who is director of the institute as well as director of the hospital 's laboratories , denied that the $10,000 a year which Hektoen receives from Abbott is rent money . Claims Overtime Work He also said that my work his laboratory staff did for the drug company was done on overtime and that it is " infix- 1 itesimally small . " Abbott officials , however , insist that the $10,000 covers their rent at the hospital and that they have paid substantial sums for laboratory work done during tegular working hours . ? The rent money , which was first paid in September , 1963 , totals $73,000 . The amount paid for the blood and biochemistry tests is $23,741 . " Abbott pays no rent , " Dr. Hoffman said , " The money $10,000 a year is a donation to Hektoen . There are no strings attached to it at all . We really do n't have an agreement with them . " When asked why Abbott paid the money to Hektoen instead of the County hospital , a spokesman for the drug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was the thing we were told to do . If you do research at County hospital , you ha ve to deal with Hektoen . " Calls Action Improper Dr. Philip G. Thomsen , a member of the new nine-man County hospital governing commission , said the diversion of the rental money is improper . " This represents a significant loss of money that rightly belongs to the County hospital , " Dr. Samuel J. Hoffman said Dr. Thomsen , who is the immediate past president of the Illinois State Medical society . " The commission should have control over all of these funds . " The agreement to pay Hektoen $10,000 a year and to reimburse the institute for work performed for Abbott by hospital laboratory technicians was made in August , 1963 . Signers of Pact Those signing the agreement in addition to Dr. Hoffman included two other top hospital officials who are also officials of Hektoen . They are Dr. Karl A. Meyer , who retired three years ago at the age of 81 as superintendent of County , and Dr. Frederic k Steigmann , chairman of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the board of Hektoen . Dr. Steigmann , who is paid $24,300 a year as chairman of the gastroenterology d e p a r tment , receives a $250-a-month Dr. Philip G. Thomsen - consultation fee from Abbott . He is also secretary of the board of the Hektoen institute . Volunteers Are Used A check of the hospital records revealed that the space occupied by Abbott is assigned to Dr. Steigmann . Abbott 's drug research program at County involves the clinical testing of new drugs on volunteers . The volunteers are medical students and patients who must sign a consent statement agreeing to participate in the tests . The subjee 's are fully informed on the nature of the tests . Dr. Richard Powers , who is in charge of Abbott 's research program at County , is also on the voluntary staff at the hospital and spends one day a week treating patients . County laboratory technicians also perform tests for other private hospitals and medical facilities , and the funds collected from this work have been deposited in special funds at Hektoen . Toxicology Fund Involved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poisoning cases samples are sent to County 's laboratory division for analysis to determine if there is any poison in the material . The private facilities the n pay Hektoen for the work done by County employes . The scandal last June over the hospital 's blood bank fund led the county board to ask for an audit of the Hektoen toxicology fund . Dr. Robert Baker , who was suspended as chief of surgery at the hospital , is under indictment on charges of mismanagement of the blood bank fund . The audit of the toxicology fund revealed that Hektoen was paid $10,755 for work the hospital technicians did mostly for private hospitals for the eight months ending Aug. 31 , 1969 . Fund Given to County Another fund , called the placenta fund because the Pitman-Moore Drug company paid 50 cents for each placenta it received from the hospital , was ordered turned over to the county by the county auditor on Dec. 8 , 1969 . This fund contained $40,522 . " We are custodians for a lot of funds , and we must charge an overhead to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We have nothing to hide over here . "
