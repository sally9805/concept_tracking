 | his presence to enliven them ; even though I think she had decided , quite some time before he sent her from his side , that she must go . With her also resides the Prince Tutankhaten , just a week ago entered upon his eighth year . He is growing into a reserved , quiet , thoughtful little lad . We used to see him toddling about , fat , happy , always gurgling with laughter . Now he is thinner , less happyrather sickly , in factand now he walks more solemnly , forcing a dignity beyond his years , as though he feels already the weight of the Double Crown he may someday have to wear . . . someday not too far off , I am afraid , unless His Majesty decides to live his life much differently than he has in recent times . In the North Palace also reside three of His Majesty 's four surviving daughters by the Chief Wife : Ankh-e-sen-pa-a-ten , thirteen , who is to be married to the little prince later this year ; Nefer-neferu-ra , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her mother when her mother bore this name . This was before His Majesty took the name from her and gave it to His other Majesty , his younger brother the Prince Smenkhkara , now Ankh-Kheperu-Ra Smenkhkara , Co-Regent , King and Pharaoh also , in the union that has all of Kemet , and especially all of us here in the Court , saddened and dismayed that such things can be . That is why I say the little prince may come to wear the Double Crown " someday not too far off . " Akhenaten flies in the face of all right and reason : he overturns ma'at , the eternal order and fitness of things that has existed in Kemet from the Beginning . He affronts the gods , whom he has hurled from their temples and driven from the land . And he hurries their return , for they live in the hearts of the people where his vengeance can never reach them , and wait patiently for their time to come again . As it will , for His Majesty 's time is no more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calendar of theirs . Yet I should not be happy to see his downfall , and so in a way I am just as pleased that I shall probably not live to witness it . Because His Majesty and I have known great days . We have performed many " wonders , " as he calls them , together . I shall never regret , though I live in the afterworld forever and ever , for millions and millions of years , that I was at his side and was given the privilege of assisting him , in the days before he went beyond us into his strange world and left us all behind . Have you been to Karnak and seen the three colossal statues of him that I sculpted there ? They guard the entrance to his first great temple to the Aten , which he built in the days before he established this city of Akhet-Aten . Have you noticed how I captured him , the very essence of his being , the long , narrow eyes , proud and arrogant and yet hiding  | such painsuch pain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon him as a youth , and whose bitter gifts I also captured in the stone : the sagging belly , the woman 's hips , the spindly shanks , the skinny arms , the elongated neck , the pendulous lips , the high cheekbones , the face that Kemet has called " Horse Face " for almost twenty years . All , all , I captured in the stone . And he approved my doing it , he urged me to do it . When I demurred at first , he said , " Bek ! Bek ! I live in truth , and you must too . Make them see me as I am , and they will know what a wonder they have as Pharaoh ! I command you , Bek . Make me as I am ! " And so I always did . . . until lately , when it has become more important to him to try to keep pace with one whose favors from nature he can never match , than to live in truth . And so he no longer cries , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Make me as I wish to be , to equal him ! " And so obediently Tuthmose and I have begun to round out the cheeks , smooth out the hollows , make him look younger , more conventional , more perfect in the style all Pharaohs before him have favored . I have tried to help him match Smenkhkara 's golden beauty , which of course he can never in reality do , and becomes thereby , to all who see him as he actually is , pathetic in the trying . Pathetic and more than pathetic : for in these past three years he has ordered me to sculpt and paint things that not only have offended me as a man but have violated my honor as an artist . And for that , since I of course have had no option but to do as he wished , I think I can not find it in my heart to forgive His Majesty . Statues of a king embracing a kingpaintings of a king kissing a king stelae of a king fondling a king ! I hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may never see the light of day in after years . But they will last our time , I know that , for he has ordered them created without shame , and he has ordered them displayed without shame , and without shame he has forced upon Kemet the spectacle of himself and his brother almost as man and wife . And shame has come to the House of Thebes because of it , and because of it great sadness and foreboding lie upon the Two Lands . I know the pretense he used to offer , though in recent months he has abandoned even thatthe pretense that because the Chief Wife is no longer beside him ( and why is this , one may ask , if not that he himself decreed it ! ) therefore King Smenkhkara stands in her stead and takes her place as his helper in the worship of the Aten , and so must have her titles , her power and ( who dares guess how fully ? ) her wifehood as well .  | Who believes such madness ? It is folly , self-delusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ none dares call it so for fear of His Majesty 's vengeance . Or perhaps I should say : none outside the Great House dares call it so . Because , as one who passes quite freely in and out and is able by virtue of his skills to spend some time in both the North Palace and the South , and sometimes in Queen Tiye 's Palace of Malkata in Thebes as well , I sense that there are some within the walls who have more freedom to speak their minds than we dothough even they , I think , hesitate to challenge him direct , but instead satisfy themselves with doing what they can to conceal the record of his folly . Thus the matter of the " coronation durbar " which has now become such an issue in the Palace . .. . When he returned from Thebes after his father 's funeralnever , to this day , to leave Akhet-Aten againhe held a " coronation durbar , " as he called it . At first he proposed that he should crown King Smenkhkara and that King Smenkhkara @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arguments that took place in the Family . There must have been some , because presently it was announced that fierce old Pinhasy , chief servitor of the Aten , would crown them both , chanting His Majesty 's Hymn to the Aten for the first time directly to His Majesty , as though His Majesty now embodied the Aten and should now be worshiped as the Aten . ( No priests of Amon dared protest . None , at least openly , are to be found . Amon 's temples stand desecrated and deserted from one end of Kemet to the other . Only an occasional whisper indicates that the young priest Hatsuret and some of his closest friends still move in hiding through the land . Once I came upon the Councilor Ayewho now styles himself " Divine Father , " meaning " father-in-law of the God , " namely Akhenatenand General Horemheb talking in a corridor at Malkata. " curet , " I thought I heard that portion of a name as the general spoke to his father " is now near Memphis where I am sending him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Tell him to be of good heart . Tell him that soon we will bring him " Then abruptly they became aware of my approach and turned away with a sudden burst of talk about innocuous things . I pretended I had not heard , though I am convinced that the full name Horemheb spoke was " Hatsuret . " ) So the coronation durbar was held , a tragic spectacle for all who love the eternal ma'at and fitness of things in the Two Landsand that is everyone , I think , except Their two Majesties , who care neither for ma'at nor for the feelings of their people . Side by side they sat upon their thrones , King Smenkhkara at his brother 's right hand where the Chief Wife should have been , no others  | of the Family anywhere about . Pinhasy put the crowns upon their heads and chanted the Hymn to Akhenaten as the embodied Aten . Smenkhkara rose from his throne , stepped forward , turned , bowed low , offered sacrifice and formal worship to his brother . Akhenaten raised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his seat . A dutiful shout went up from the scanty crowd of court sycophants gathered before the King 's House to witness this sad proceeding . A straggling little line of emissaries from abroadMittani , Naharin , Byblos , wretched Kushall that cared , or could be commanded , now in these days when our possessions fall away from the slack hands of His Majestyjostled one another by with meager gifts : this was the " Parade of Tribute . " Akhenaten clapped his hands . Trumpets blew , a chariot race began , youths dutifully leaped into athletic contests , a forced air of gaiety covered all . Within the hour the games and envoys were gone , the two kings had withdrawn , the crowd had dispersed , the palace grounds were deserted . Ra moved on impervious through an empty sky , over an empty scene . As quickly as possible , all was forgottenuntil a week ago , when both Huy , the chief steward of Queen Tiye , and Meryra , the chief steward of Queen Nefertiti , reached that point in the building of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must do , of course , on fear of deathto His Majesty . Then arose the question of how they should best do this . To me , who am still consulted graciously though I give my advice from a bed I do not think I will leave aliveand to Tuthmose , who now actually carries out my suggestions and his own skilled ideasthey both proposed that they use the scene of the coronation durbar . " As it was ? " I questioned , startled that they should make such a choice . " Without the Chief Wife and the Family ? " echoed Tuthmose , equally aghast . " His Majesty lives in truth , " Huy said , a smug look on his face . " He will want it exactly as it was . " " If we , too , are to live in truth as he wishes all men to do , " remarked Mcryra with similar superiority , " then you must portray it as it happened . " " I would suggest , " I remarked , I am afraid quite dryly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advise . " " ' they need not know , " Huy said , though here in Akhet-Aten , where the tombs along the northern and southern ridges bounding the city are open to public view at all times , nothing is concealed . " I would rather risk their anger at being told than risk their anger if things are hidden from them , " I said with sufficient severity to stop their  | flippant attitude and sober their smug faces . When they spoke to the Great Wife and Nefertiti later that day , their carefree approach ended altogether . And now we have the bitter controversy that flares within the Palace and seems to have produced some sort of culmination in the continuing crisis we have all lived with ever since Akhenaten sent his wife to the North Palace and installed his brother in her stead . In the cities and villages of Kemet , no one knows that this battle rages . But it is not in the cities and villages , of course , that the fate of Their Majesties will be decided . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rule of Kemet , for the people have never rebelled in all our nearly two thousand years of history . Even now , ruled by the One who is increasingly , if still with great secrecy , called " the Madman " and " the Criminal , " they will not rebel . He is still the Good God , and it is unthinkable to them that they might ever rise against him . Unhappily for him , such superstitious acceptance does not prevail within the Family . Yesterday the orders came down , almost simultaneously , from his palace , from Queen Tiye 's and from Queen Nefertiti 's , to poor unfortunate Huy and Meryra . It will be quite a while , I think , before they find life a subject for smug jesting again . His Majesty commanded : portray the coronation durbar exactly as it was , himself and his brother alone ( fondly entwined ! ) the paltry " Parade of Tribute " straggling by . The Great Wife and the Chief Wife commanded : portray the coronation durbar as the eternal traditions and ma'at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our historyNefertiti seated beside Akhenaten , their daughters ( even those who are dead , for this is royal myth , not royal fact ) around them , a lavish and fawning Parade of Tribute maintaining the dignity of the Double Crownnot exactly truthful , of course , but as truthful as most of the pictures of royal triumphs that have come down to us from ancient days . Now the battle rages . I do not care what the outcome is , for I am now , ironically , in a position where I am privileged to watcha privilege I would gladly yield were it possible , but one which I do not think the gods will permit me to evade . Tuthmose is a little more in the center of things , but he too is safe . We exist to carry out orders , not give them . There is much stirring in the palaces . Horemheb and his chief aide General Ramesses have hurried back from Memphis , where they had gone to attend to the government 's business in the Delta . Aye and his sister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amonhotep , Son of Hapu , that sainted scribe whose wisdom becomes more universally  | respected as he learns to express it less , is bustling about . Tuthmose is keeping me informed . I feel the wind , though I am no longer able to be at the center of the storm . And storm it is , I am afraid , for His Majesty . I fear for him and weep for him , because I think in his own strange way he has always meant to do right , and to live in truth . It is his tragedy that his truth is unlike the truth of any other . In that , I think , His Majesty has found the seeds of his downfall , at last . Amonemhet I am Amon-em-het the peasant , and you will remember how I saw His Majesty with the Prince Smenkhkarawhom we must now call " His Majesty , " toosailing downriver to Akhet-Aten from Thebes , golden in the torchlight against the dark bosom of Hapi , god of the Nile , chanting His Majesty 's Hymn to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when my wife and I frolicked too much and wound up with child number three . Not that I mind him , or the method of his getting , which is always pleasant any time , but he does have to be fed , of course , and that poses a problem . But we love children , and we manage . Number four will be here in another two weeks . Then , I suppose , will come live , six , seven , eightmay the gods stop us ! Ho , ho ! Let them try ! Anyway , I told you on that night when I saw His Majesty that it did not matter much to us here in the village what happens in the great cities among the great men . But in this I think I spoke too easily and too fast , because it has come to matter much in these last three years . It used to be that we would hear distant reports that all was not going well in Kemet . Before His Majesty 's father diedAmonhotep III ( life , health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us so well and looks better all the time compared to what we have nowwe used to hear rumors , sometimes , about troubles in far-off places . It was said our allies , or countries we owned , or were friendly with , were not friendly any more . But this did not bother us in the village . It was all far away . It was also reportedparticularly by old Sahura , he who once was a scribe and went to the cities before he came home to sit in the square all day and demand that we listen to his old man 's warnings of disaster that there was trouble in the whole government . He said order was  | breaking down , ma'at was being violated , bad times were coming to the Two Lands because of the Pharaoh Akhenaten . And even though we did notice that the priests of Amon were worried and seemed not quite so powerful , and occasionally a tax collector tried to take more than what seemed to us to be our fair share of taxes ( the last such wound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was seen again , may the Forty-two Judges of the Dead keep him drowning forever in the jaws of Sebek the crocodile god ! ) , still it all seemed far away and not much of our concern . But now that His Majesty Akhenaten is King , with His Majesty Smenkhkara beside him on the throne ( and somewhere else , too , so everyone says ) , I have to admit it : there is real trouble in Kemet . It is not far away now , it is in the village . Now it concerns us because it is in our own place . Now we must pay attentionalthough there is not much that we can do about it now , of course : it has gone too far . It has got away from us almost before we knew it was happening . And of course we are only ignorant peasants who must obey the will of His Majesty in all things , as has ever been the way of the Two Lands . But , I tell you ! Now we have tax collectors who come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or cheated , but in gangs and bands who rove through the village and demand great sums and call in soldiers to help them destroy our dikes and fields if we will not pay . Who gets these sums we do not know , but we do not think they can go to His Majesty , or that His Majesty knows of this , for surely he would not permit it , being just and good and a father to us as Pharaoh has always been . But somebody gets this money . Somebody sends the thieves and the soldiers . Who is it ? Who is to protect us ? And now we do not see priests of Amon any more , who also used to take taxes from us , but who gave us in return food and shelter when we needed it , and helped us from their granaries if we got a low Nile and the Inundation did not flood our fields properly with water and new soil . Now the priests of Amon are all in hiding , and the new priests of the Aten lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seize our crops and even take our children away to place them in the service of the Aten , who is His Majesty 's god and not ours , and whom nobody in the village wants . Is this done at His Majesty 's command ? We do not believe it . But somebody commands it , for it is done . And whom can we look to for salvation from these crimes ? It should be the duty of His Majesty to protect us , but he does not . What are we to do ? Now we talk , all up and down the river , from village to village in the ancient way that carries the news of Kemet swiftly from the Fourth Cat- aract to the Delta . Now we are all aware of what is happening , because it is causing trouble for us , and for our wives and children . We did not pay attention when His Majesty was Co-Regent with his father , because we knew his father and the Great Wife still had some power in Kemet to see that we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew they were trying to look out for us . We could ignore his god the Aten , which we did , because Amon and the other gods we have always worshiped were permitted to continue much as they had always done . Now all has changed . Now it is known to us that His Majesty is not interested in keeping the faraway lands that brought wealth to Kemet and helped us all . He is not interested in caring for his people when they go hungry and need assistance . He is not interested in maintaining ma'at and the eternal order of Kemet which has always given us a contented life along the Nile , in good years and lean . He is not interested in protecting us , as the Good God should . He is interested in three things only : His god the Aten . His brother the King Smenkhkara . And himself . We would never do anything to harm His Majesty , for he is the Living lows , Son of the Sun , King of the Two Lands , Good God and Pharoah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been the way in Kemet . But we no longer believe in him , nor do we love him any more , since he does not love us . And we thinknay , I will go further since I am saying my thoughts secretly and in private , and say we hopethat this will weaken him enough so that someone can do something to save us from him . Save us , his own people , from Pharaoh ! How sad that it should come to that ! How sad for Pharaoh , and for us , who wanted only to love him had he but kept his trust with us and made it possible for us to do so . Now from the Fourth Cataract to the Delta we know this is not to be . And this is sad and frightening for Kemet , because we do not know what will happen to us , and in the village we all go fearful and uneasy because of it , and even in the midst of frolicking with my wife I find I can not stop thinking of it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and blames me for being a weakling and no man , when it is really His Majesty she should blame .  | Poor Naphuriawhom I still call that , as we do in my native Mesopotamia , because in ten years as his second wife we have never been close enough so that I could comfortably call him Akhenaten . Poor Naphuria , who thrashes about in the grip of his futile love and his unloved god and wonders why the Two Lands slip away from him ! Or does he wonder ? Sometimes I think he cares not at all , so recklessly does he conduct himself , with so harsh and contemptuous a disregard for the traditional ways of Kemet . They were not my ways when I came here , and it has taken me awhile to understand them , but I have learned that they are good for Kemet . They have kept this ancient land in relative peace and stability for almost two thousand years , saving only the invasion of the Hyksos and a few weak kings here and there , and two millennia is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , in fact , of no other like it . But such a heritage apparently means nothing at all to him . Nefertiti and I have been living in the North Palace ever since our return from Thebes after the funeral of the old Pharaoh three years ago . I did not have to go : Akhenaten did not banish me from his side because I have never really been there . But I thought it best to go with her whose strength and courage I have always admired . There was nothing for me in the palace of men . We have with us brave little Tut , no longer the happy child he used to be . The intimations of the adult world have turned him old before his time , and the knowledge that he may be called upon at any moment to replace his brother weighs heavily upon him . I think he still loves and stands in awe of his brotherof both brothers , in factand the thought that he may be used to do them violence troubles and shadows what was once a sunny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ openly , that violence is what may be done : but it is implicit . Implicit in the air , and implicit , let us be honest about it , in the situation . Thus does the corruption of the Aten , confused and confounded yet more by the unhealthy love of the brothers , spread and poison the happiness of the Family , as it spreads and poisons the happiness of the land .  | Yet I do not think Tut sees it in these terms , being still a child , nor does the Chief Wife , nor her three daughters who also live with us . To Nefertiti particularly , whose powerful personality influences all of us who live closely with her , the Aten remains , I think , the perfect ideal to which she would like to see all Kemet aspire . She has never wavered in her faith in the Sole God , and she still , I think , loves the Sole God 's prophet . The habit of love , ingrained in them both by their parents from earliest childhood , remains unbroken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in him , I think , because he has made no move to " disgrace " her as those who fall from favor in Kemet can be disgracedby the destruction of her portraits and cartouches everywhere in the land , the smashing of her statues , the abolition of her name , and thus of her very ka and ba , the soul and essence of her being . ( Only one cartouche , on a " sun-shade " on the Nile that he has given to Merytaten , has actually been replaced , of all her thousands . ) Nor has she " disappeared , " except that she now occupies a separate residence and is no longer portrayed officially as being at his side . It is true that he has given his brother one of her names , Neferuncfcru-aten , " Fair is the Goodness of the Aten , " has conferred on him the titulary " Beloved of Akhenaten , " and has had the two of them portrayed together in poses more than brotherly . But she lives on , unmolested and well maintained , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they even see one another when they proceed in their separate chariots to the Great Temple of the Aten to do worship , though both make every attempt to assure that their visits will not coincide . When they do , no glance is exchanged , no word is spoken . All fall silent and , oblations done as swiftly as is decent , they hastily remount and speed away to their separate palaces . But , for a wife the gossips of Kemet would have you believe is " disgraced , " Nefertiti manages to live on very well . Such , it seems to me , is token enough that somewhere in the strange world to which he has gone from us the Good God retains some sense of sanity and balance , at least on that particular subject ; and also , I believe some memory of love , if not its actual being , which will not permit him to be fatally harsh to her . Partly because of this , but more , I believe , because she truly believes in the concept of one universal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And so all of us in her household remain true to it too : Tutankhaten , who himself may yet rule in the name of the Aten ; healthy and determined Ankh-e-sen-pa-aten , who will become his Queen ; sickly Nefer-neferu-aten Junior and sickly Nefer-neferu-ra , both of whom give promise of soon following into the afterworld the sixth little sister ,  | Set-e-pen-ra , who withered and died , like a lotus taken from the river 's edge and planted in the open desert , scarce six months after the move to the North Palace . The oldest princess , tough and ambitious little Merytaten , Queen of her uncle Smenkhkara , now lords it over the King 's House in the stead of her mother , whom she apparently despises , for no kind word to the Chief Wife ever comes from her . She seems content with her lot , even though her marriage is known in the palaces to be simply form without substance . I believe she has no desire to have children , and indeed can not , since she was injured in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another feeble infant who perished several years ago after an uncomfortable and mercifully short existence . ( Why is it that Akhenaten can beget only girls , most of them sickly ? Is it some punishment of Amon , perhaps , who has never forgiven him and bides only the time when his priests can reclaim their power ? ) To Merytaten , being the only Queen at the side of the two Pharaohs is evidently quite enough . She supervises her father 's household , attends him at ceremonies , travels with Smenkhkara on his frequent visits to Thebes . He has returned to the compound of Malkata and established a palace there , which he occupies quite frequently , almost as if he considered this some form of appeasement of Amonthough he rarely goes near the deserted temples at Karnak and Luxor , and always hurries back to his brother to make public show of his devotion to the Aten . To me this seems very typical of Smenkhkara , who remains a charming , golden man as he was a charming , golden youth , but who seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indecisive and seeming to hang between two divergent paths of action . Perhaps this accounts for his relationship with his brother . Weakness usually seeks strength , but in a certain kind of mentality weakness seeks weakness . Yet perhaps in this I am being unfair to Akhenaten , because I do not think " weakness " is exactly the right word for him . Certainly one who has had the character to defy the awesome weight of the ancient gods and traditions of two thousand years , who has finally declared and conducted open battle against Amon , the most powerful of them all , who has dared to " live in truth " in ways that are shocking and affronting to his people , who has defied the powerful members of his own family who oppose his policies , who has deliberately placed himself beyond the reach and understanding of ordinary men , even more than the godkings of the Nile are beyond the understanding of ordinary mensuch a one is not exactly " weak . " He has a powerful personality and a powerful will , my husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact that the  | word " poor " comes automatically to my mind , and to that of many others , when we think of him , that there is indication of how weak , in the most fundamental sense , he is . He is weak in that he is beyond the understanding of mankind . He is weak in that he no longer has a foot on the common ground , he is no longer in touch with reality as it is perceived by most who tread the earth . He has moved ever more steadily into a world of his own , a world unique to him alonean insane world , if you like . Not even poor Smenkhkara , I suspect , can truly follow poor Naphuria where he goes . We wonder , in the North Palace and at Malkatawhere the Great Wife still prefers to live , though she comes often here to see her sons ( and always , with complete impartiality and lack of fear , sees Nefertiti and the rest of us , as well ) what Smenkhkara makes of all this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Does he bear the name , title , and aspect of wife to his brother willingly ? Does he approve when Naphuria orders Bek and Tuthmose to make Naphuria steadily younger and more beautiful in his statues , abandoning that " living in truth " that touched his earlier portraitures with near grotesquerie , so that he may try to match ( pathetically , we all think ) the gifts nature has conferred on Smenkhkara ? Does Smenkhkara approve of the stelae and statues that show the two of them in intimate and candid embrace ? Does Smenkhkara ever wonder whether he , too , is leaving sanity to live in his brother 's world ? Or is he content to bask in the favor of the Good God , accept his gifts along with his attentions , and appear unabashed and unashamed in a relationship that most would accept were it kept private , but which none in tradition-bound Kemet can accept when it is flaunted before them officially by Pharaoh ? And does he truly believe in the Aten , or is that , too , just a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are questions that are now suddenly inescapable as the Family gathers to do battle over the paintings of the coronation durbar in the tombs of Huy and Meryra . Normally you would not think two paintings on two stone walls would cause such furor , but . you must understand that in Kemet things that are pictured are . They exist because they are painted , and they exist only as they are paintedand they exist , you must remember , not just for a year or two but for all eternity in this preserving desert air . Therefore it is considered very important , in the Family , how things are portrayed , because this becomes the official history that will go down forever to those who come after . It is no wonder they are concerned about the tombs of Huy and Meryra , for in them the story will be told for all timenot necessarily as it was , but as the Dynasty wishes it to be . So , the battle of the durbar , which has brought them all to Akhet-  | Aten . Queen Tiye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ docked shortly after noon today . We understand she went directly to her own small palace . Already she has sent word that she , Aye and Horemheb will visit us in the North Palace this evening , " before we see Their Majesties . " This means the three who must ultimately decide the Family 's position wish to take counsel with the Chief Wife , and possibly me as well , before they act . It is flattering and it is also dangerous , for it may well invite the open wrath of Akhenaten , whose temper is becoming steadily more erratic and unpredictable . But we are not afraid . When we received the messenger , Nefertiti merely read the Great Wife 's words aloud to me and then turned to the waiting servant and said quietly : " Tell the Great Wife that Her Majesty Kia and I will be most happy to receive her , the Councilor , and General Horemheb at the evening hour that suits them . " Then when he had swiftly gone she turned to me with a slight smile and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filled with so much sadness , and said , with a trace of wistfulness in her voice : " Poor Naphuria , as you would say . Once again he flirts with fate and invites the wrath of the Family . We must try to give our judgments fairly . " " Yes Majesty , " I agreed . " I believe we can do so . " " I , too , believe it , " she said , " though , once again , it will not be a happy time . " Her eyes widened in thought and almost to herself she added , " Why does he always persist in making life so hard for himself ? " This I could not answer ; although in fairness it must be said that on this occasion the responsibility is equal . It is Naphuria who wishes to tell the unadorned truth about the pathetic little coronation durbar . It is the Chief Wife and the Great Wife and the rest of the Family who want to tell the official lie . It is , as usual , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invite . Poor Naphuria , indeedand poor Smenkhkara , too ; because this time , I think , the results may be very serious . The confrontation that is coming has been building for three years . It could have come over almost anything but , rather absurdly to me who am still , and will always be , essentially an outsider , it has come over something as seemingly trivial as two paintings in a couple of tombs . The feeling must have been growing in the Family for some time that a turning point would have to come . Nefertiti and the Great Wife have deliberately helped to precipitate it by their orders to Huy and Meryra . They could only have done so , I believe , at the direct suggestion of Aye  | and forcmhch . Naphuria 's order came firstthat made him vulnerable . The decision seems to be that now is the time to make use of this . Poor Naphuria and poor Smenkhkara ! I do not like either one , particularly , but as a disinterested party I do not enjoy seeing them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great disaster for them , for Kemet , and for us all . I wonder what is happening here . My mother landed at noon today , and already , so my brother and I are told , she has notified Nefertiti that she , Aye and Horemheb will visit the North Palace this evening before they see my brother and me . I do not understand it . Simple courtesy would dictate a call upon the Sons of the Sun before seeing a castoff wife ( two , for Kia of course has chosen , in her spiteful way , to go with her ) whose only purpose must be harm to us . Perhaps the purpose of my mother , my uncle and my cousin is also harm to us . If so , we are ready for it . It does not frighten us . We are strong together and we will defy them . Not all their spiteful plottings will drive Akhenaten and me from the path of love and glory for the Men to which we have decided ourselves . We defy them . I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many times in Thebes , never failing to visit the Great Wife dutifully on each occasion . At times she has tried to argue with me , as mothers will , but I have not paid much attention . I have turned it all aside with a laugh and a joke , as I long ago learned to turn aside everything hurtful and unpleasant . Or did I have to " learn " this ? As far as I can remember , it has always been my nature , save for the occasion when my brother and I first became one , many years ago . Then for a few days I did feel a terrible remorse and sadness , a terrible regret for what I seemed to be " doing " to my cousin Nefertiti and to my mother . Soon , however , my brother convinced me that whatever was being done , they were doing , since they were attempting to interfere with a union ordained by the Aten and intended only to strengthen my brother so that he might betor conduct the Aten 's worship and better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have never worried , regretted or looked back . And I  | do not intend to now , whatever they may be plotting in the North Palace . On my visits to Thebes I have now and then investigated the temples of Amon at Luxor and Karnak . The few remaining priests there , those gaunt-eyed , starving ones who scuttle about the silent corridors and peek out at me from behind deserted columns as I pass , obviously think my brother has sent me there to spy upon them . And so he has , and why should he not ? They spy on us all the time , those few who are left openly , and those many who hide among the people and make their futile plans to overthrow us . We still have not caught Hatsuret , though our spies report him here , there , and everywhere from Karoy to Memphis and back . The people secrete him among themselves and not all my brother 's threats of vengeance serve to bring him out . But he only plots : he does not put plots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he does not receive help from those who are closer to us . This may now be about to happen , though I would prefer it not , for it will only mean great danger , and perhaps death , for my mother , for Nefertiti , for Aye and Horemheb . We can not suffer them to plot against us , breeding treachery in the Two Lands , the army , even in the palaces . That would violate the very ma'at of Kemet , because an attack upon the Sons of the Sun is an attack upon the soul of the land itself . My brother and I are the guardians of that soul : indeed we are that soul , as Pharaoh has always been . Were the hands of the Great Wife , my uncle , my cousin and the Chief Wife to be lifted against us , then , surely , would the people rise in our behalf . And sad would be the fate of the Family . I do not want this to happen and I do not believe Akhenaten does either . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense will prevail and keep them from this folly . Anything else would be sad very sad , because we would have to take vengeance , and we would not hesitate . And the people , rallying to our cause , would make their names anathema in Kemet forever and ever , for millions and millions of years . I know Akhenaten has wished Merytaten to convey this warning to the Chief Wife before it is too late , but I do not believe she obeys her father . She told me with a sniff , " Why should I go out of my way to see her ? I am the mistress of the Great House and the King 's Palace . Let her come to me , if she wishes to be warned ! " That is one of the many reasons why I do not like Merytaten , who is my niece and my wife and who despises me just about as much , I think , as I despise her . We have never been close , there has always been a prickly truce between us . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : she positively preens herself upon the way she now lords it over her . As far as I know , she has never gone near her since Akhena-  | ten sent Nefertiti to the North Palace three years ago . And on the one occasion , a year ago , when Nefertiti finally found sufficient forgiveness in her heart to attempt a reconciliation , Merytaten dashed the basket of fruit and gifts from the hands of Nefertiti 's messenger and drove him out of the Palace , shrieking threats and imprecations against her mother which the terrified fellow had to promise he would swiftly carry back . Two minutes later , of course , Merytaten had gathered together all the giftssome of them quite ornate , including two golden pectorals and a lapis lazuli scarab bracelet from Nefertiti 's own private collectionand was sitting on the floor placidly eating one of the pomegranates she had sent , spitting out the seeds in all directions and humming a satisfied little song to herself . " Why are you so cruel to her ? " I could not help blurting out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She does me harm just by living , " she said in a flippant tone . To which I could not resist : " I think she did us all harm by giving you life . " Thereupon , of course , she screamed and shrieked at me , casting various aspersions upon my character and manhood which I chose to suffer in patient silence , as there were servants about in the outer hall and I have some respect for the dignity of the Double Crown , if she does not . She did not quite dare go so far as to attack what makes her most jealous , namely the perfect understanding that exists between her father and me , but she made enough unpleasant insinuations so that I am sure the servants had another good gossip that day , as they often do at our expense . This is largely because of her , however : Akhenaten and I of course make no secret of our union , because we live in truth , but we conduct ourselves with dignity as Father Aten wishes us to do . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I have suggested upon occasion to my brother that he discipline her for this , but he seems curiously listless about her effronteries as he does about so many things these days . I think he is not in very good health ; his energies seem to be declining ; the strain of maintaining the cause of the Aten against the growing opposition of the Family , the still virulent hatred of the dispossessed priests of Amon , and the general apathy ( if not outright hostility ) of the people toward the Sole God have inevitably begun to take their toll . Lately there has been added to this a growing arthritis that attacks and weakens his always vulnerable frame . As if defying it , he has asked Bck and Tuthmose to portray him in a fashion ever younger and more handsome in their sculptures , stelae and paintings . I do not know really why he has done this , unless it is to impress the people , who now see  | him no longer save here in Akhet-Aten , and even here on increasingly fewer occasions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always prided himself on living in truth , should now be engaged in a deliberate lie about his appearance . He looked at me in the strangest , most stricken way , and asked , in the emotional croak his voice becomes in moments of tension , " You mean you do not know ? " " No , " I said , I am afraid in a somewhat offhand manner . " You are always handsome to me . " He cried out , some harsh , inarticulate sound : his eyes filled abruptly with tears . Apparently I had hurt him deeply in some way I have never been able to understand , no matter how many times I have gone back over it . After a moment he composed himself , clearly with great effort , and reached out a hand to comfort me , because his stricken countenance had of course turned mine stricken too . " It does not matter , " he said then . " It does not matter . " And he refused to discuss it with me , ever again . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if one were to see only the portraits of these later years in Akhet-Aten one would believe he had always been as handsome and as virile as any other Pharaoh . Apparently , as I say , he does it to impress the people , since he goes no longer among them very much . He has not left this city since we returned here after our father 's entombment in Thebes , and even here his appearances are becoming more and more infrequent . Occasionally still he will worship the Aten in the Great Temple , occasionally he will still dispense gifts from the Window of Appearances , now and again he will still visit the ledge along the Northern Tombs from which one gets such a commanding view of the city and the plain ( and where so many significant things , including our own understanding , have happened , over the years ) . But all of this is becoming steadily rarer . Increasingly he worships in his private chapel in the King 's Palace ; it has been six months since he held a ceremony at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since he ventured to the Northern Tombs . And to Memphis , our northern capital in the Delta , and to Thebes , he ventures , in these recent years , not at all . He has become increasingly what I overheard our cousin Horemheb remark to his faithful shadow Ramesses one day " the Prisoner of Akhet-Aten . " ( I let them see that I heard it , and did not like it , but our cousin Horemheb did not look impressed by my annoyance , and Ramesses , not knowing which of us to fear the most , only gave me a sickly smile as I brushed past with a deliberately imperious air . They are always huddling together , those two , planning I know not what : though  | Horemheb continues faithfully to execute my brother 's orders against the priesthoods , and Ramesses apes him dutifully in that as in all else . ) " The Prisoner of Akhet-Aten " and therefore , of course , my own frequent travels . " I want you to be my eyes and ears , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Palace with Merytaten three years ago . I did not know then that he intended to isolate himselfor rather , perhaps , that the Aten would further cripple his already crippled form , perhaps so that he could concentrate more upon the Aten 's worship without the distractions of travel . I knew only that he wished me to do this to assist him . In the same loving spirit in which I have always assisted all his enterprises , I of course said I would . My first move was to return to Thebes and secure my mother 's permission to construct a small palace for myself and Merytatenwho , insufferable as she is , is still Pharaoh 's daughter and my Queen , and has her birthright of official honorswithin the compound of Malkata . I then began the regular round of travels which takes me three times a year to Thebes and three times a year to Memphis . Thus am I able to supervise those activities of government with which he has entrusted me , and to act truly as his Co-Regent and helper in ruling the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well . And I also am able to fulfill some of the public ceremonial demands that he no longer cares , or perhaps is unable , to perform . I always take his latest statue with me and place it , in full regalia , beside me on the platform : and I suspect that in the minds of our younger people , and among the elder who have not seen him in many years , and whose memory grows hazy with time , there is a gradual replacement , by this handsome and sturdy figure , of the awkward , misshapen , shuffling reality that once was known everywhere in Kemet . Thus do I assist him in that aim of his also . I really do think I conduct the government very well for my brother . And although at first I was made somewhat hesitant and confused by the foreign policy , for instance , conducted by our Foreign Minister , Tutu , I think I have come to understand it quite sufficiently . It consists of trying to maintain those alliances we still have in the far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the dispatches that come in from there . I read them and report on them to Akhenaten . We discuss them from time to time and I report back to Tutu his instructions : keep trying to warn off our enemies and keep trying to satisfy our friends , who always clamor for gold and also , of late , beg us to send troops to protect them from their neighbors . This last I am unable to have Tutu promise , because my brother does not have the inclination or now , perhaps , the strength , to make the  | show of force that held our possessions secure in the days of our forebears , beginning with our great-great-grandfather , Tuthmose III ( life , health , prosperity ! ) and lasting down through our grandfather , Tuthmose IV ( life , health , prosperity ! ) . Our father abandoned this practice in his later years , and now it seems almost too late , in some areas , to revive it . I might enjoy , myself , going on expeditions to distant lands to re-establish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Crown but , without my brother 's agreement and active support , I can not do it by myself . And he does not seem to desire this . Again , energy flags and , with it , the will to do in time what might save us much trouble later . But I do not worry overmuch about this , because all my life I have worshiped my brother and have believed that what he decided about things was right . He believes that Kemet 's wealth and strength should be devoted to the worship of the Aten , to the establishment of the Sole God , to the banishment of magic , misery and old , evil things from the lives and minds of our people . " If people everywhere , " he has said to me often , " will but believe in the Hymn and worship the Aten as I do , then the teachings of the Aten will make them happier than they have ever been . " At first I was young and flippant , even with him , and asked : " Has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He looked at me for a very long time and finally replied quietly , " In my heart , I am happy . " And I never dared question him thus again . And , in fact , I have never really wanted to , because I too have come to believe in the Sole God , loving all men and all nations , who can make us all happy . Certainly the Aten has made me happy , for he has placed me at my brother 's side and made me , too , Living Horus , Son of the Sun , King and Pharaoh of the Two Lands : and I know there is no higher happiness a god such as I could have . I know this , as I know that it is only some passing melancholy now that makes me worry about the gathering of the Family , about this ridiculous and unnecessary quarrel over the tombs of Huy and Meryawhich of course will be decided in truth , as Akhenaten and I desire it and about the uneasy feeling I have that my mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan some unpleasantness for us if we persist in the course Father Aten has told us to follow . It is melancholy only , of that I am certain . . . though I could wish this night were past us , and all decided happily for all of us , as we desire .  | They do not know , the two besotted fools , how closely at hand wait the instruments of their destruction . They do not know that I am in AkhetAten , yea , even in the Great House itself . They do not know how well this is known to others , who also wait , and how secretly and subtly I am being helped to my tryst with them . . . for tryst I have , and all signs now point that it will not be long in coming . When I was given assurance of my safety and was aided in my hiding by General Horemheb and the Councilor and Divine Father-in-law , Aye , I did not know at first the real meaning of their assistance though I have been sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the most holy ancient temple of Amon-Ra at Karnak , that eventually the Pharaoh Akhenaten would have to die for his sins against Amon and his betrayal of the ma'at of Kemet . When my brilliance and shrewdness took me up to become chief aide to doddering old Maya , Amon 's High Priest , this conviction grew . When Akhenaten ordered Maya 's murder and desecrated the temple on the day of the entombment of the Good God Amonhotep III ( life , health prosperity ! ) , I had no further doubts . Such monstrous evil as Pharaoh did that day can have only one final repayment , however long we must wait and plot to secure it . For never was there such a dreadful thing ! He ordered General Horemheb to batter down the doors . He ordered Maya and myself to be killed as we faced the soldiers and their battering rams , our arms outspread across the ancient planks . At the last second I leaped aside , to be spirited instantly away by many willing hands among the crowd . Maya , less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seize the sacred statue of Amon-Ra , King of the Gods , and hurl it into the Nile , which they did , and called down eternal curses upon any who would seek to recover it . Of course a team of divers recruited by Horemheb recovered it that night , after Akhenaten and his brother the new King Smenkhkara had sailed downriver to Akhet-Aten ; and it , too , is in hiding , safe until the day when Amon may rule again in his rightful place in the Two Lands . Now I am in Pharoah 's house itself , having been presented to His  | Majesty six months ago by General Horemheb as a slave captured in some skirmish in Canaan . Horemheb had directed me to grow a beard , which is almost unheard of in clean-shaven Kemet , so this made me look foreign enough , and to that I added a reddish dye to my glossy black hair , and also affected a noticeable limp in my right leg , which served to disguise me further . Horemheb explained that my perfect tongue for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kemet whose family lived close to the border . I was kidnaped by a marauding band of Canaanites when I was twelve years old , he explained , and spent ten years in captivity before being retrieved . My leg , he said , had been deliberately broken by my brutal captors , and thus the limp . His Majesty , who seems to pay so little attention any more to what is actually going on in the land of Kemet that he barely glanced at me , accepted all this without question . My very oddity was my safest disguise . The only break in his indifference came when Horemheb called attention to my limp . Then he asked me to walk up and down before him , which I did with an easy awkardness , since I have practiced this handicap until I am now almost afraid that I shall not be able to walk normally again after His Majesty has been removed . " Ah , " His Majesty said , a genuine sympathy in his voice . " I , too , know what it means to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( for such is the false name I have taken ) . We shall limp about the Palace together , you and I , and keep each other company . " And he gave me for a moment a smile of quite extraordinary sweetness , which , did I not hate him so and were I not so dedicated to his death , might well have made me pause , ashamed by what we are doing to betray him . But even as I teetered for a dangerous second on the brink of this fatal precipice , he destroyed my mood by abruptly turning away . " Where is Ankh-Kheperu-Ra ? " he demanded in a high querulous voice , using King Smenkhkara 's coronation name . " He was supposed to wait upon me half an hour ago , and still he does not come . Cousin , fetch him ! " " Yes , Son of the Sun , " Horemheb said smoothly . " At once . It is all right , then , for Peneptah to be assigned to the ranks of your household scribes ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said impatiently . " Tell the old man to put him to work . We 'll find something for him to do . " " Thank you , Majesty , " I said , bowing low and feeling a great relief surge through me , for had he suspected anything I should have been  | dead upon the spot . But he turned his back upon me and shuffled away to a window where he could look out over the city , resting one clawlike hand against the wooden lintel , long bony fingers drumming insistently while he waited for his brothera rasping , scratching , anxious sound in which all his uneasy yearning was expressed . General Horemheb led me away before I could witness their touching reunion , which I am sure , now that I know them , came after a separation of no more than an hour at most . Since then I have seen them together many times . The younger King treats the elder with a deferential yet self-confident air , joshing , good-natured , patient and obviously deeply affectionate . The elder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-effacing that it is almost embarrassing to see . It is but one more reason why the rule of Nefer-Kheperu-Ra must come to an end . It is the thing that will make its ending easier , perhaps , than we now think . These past six months I have been working as a scribe with that wise old man , Amonhotep , Son of Hapu , probably the most honored of all the commoners of Kemet . Across the Nile from Thebes in the necropolis , his mortuary temple , given him by grateful Amonhotep III ( life , health , prosperity ! ) , has now been completed and is open for worship . He still , though in his sixties , supervises many of the architectural and public works . He continues to head the corps of scribes who assist Their two Majesties , and his opinion is almost always sought in the counsels of the Family . " If Amonhotep , Son of Hapu , takes a liking to you , " Horemheb told me , " all your plans will be greatly assisted . " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He has assisted mine , and I know . . .. " But somehow I have never been quite able to establish such a relationship with the old man . He knows who I am , but he has never revealed it to anyone else by so much as a hint . He could betray me and have my head in an instant if he would , but he does not do so . I assume this means that he agrees with my purposes , but I can never be sure . Perhaps he wants it this way , because it means , of course , that I can not move without his agreement . No more can I move without the agreement of Aye and Horemheb . Together these three , and possibly the Great Wife as well , whom they all consult , will decide the timing of my vengeanceand theirs . I had been working for Amonhotep , Son of Hapu , two months when he discovered my secret . He caught me with the simplest of ruses . We were alone in the writing room , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He lurched suddenly against a table , tipping it just sufficiently so that a pot of black ink began to slide toward a pile of pristine papyrus lying on the floor . " Oh ! " he cried in well-simulated anguish . " How stupid of me ! Catch it ! " And instinctively , abandoning my carefully nurtured limp , I sprang to do his bidding . " Thank you very much , Hatsuret , " he said serenely when I had secured the ink and returned the table to its upright position . " I am getting so stupid in my old age . " But I would not say Amonhotep , Son of Hapu , is stupid at all . Aside from an involuntary start at the sound of my name , which I could not suppress , I made no response . Nor have we ever discussed the matter . But Amonhotep , Son of Hapu , keeps a very close eye on me : I think for Aye and Horemheb , though he never reveals in the slightest where his sympathies lie . So I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it is apparently my task to wait until I am needed , and that I will be told when that time is , and what to do when it comes upon us . In the meantime I can only watch in anguish the desecration of the gods and the ruin of religion throughout the Two Lands . There are many among the palace servants who are still faithful to Amon , and very cautiously , little by little , I have let it be known to a few trusted ones who I am . Through them I am able to keep in touch with my principal priests in exile , and thus am I able to know most of the news of Kemet . So I know that from the Fourth Cataract to the Delta the ternpies of Amon lie in ruins , that the priesthood is dispersed and mostly in hiding as I am , that all the other principal gods , including Osiris whose rituals and customs for the dead His Majesty has abandoned , are in equal despair and desolation . Never has there been such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pharaoh , not even in the days of the Hyksos kings . Even they honored Amon-Ra and his fellow gods , even they associated the temples with their ruling . Not so the Heretic of Akhet-Aten , the Criminal , the Madman . Not so His pathetic Majesty , who shuffles about his palaces here as in a dream world , sacrificing to his false god the Aten , still trying to convince the people that one god can be so great and so all-embracing that he can know and respond to all the infinite needs of mankind , which is absurd on the face of it . I serve discreetly , I listen , I observe . I see two foolish lovers trying to pretend that they are rulers of a great country . I see all , all , religion , civil government , Empire and all , falling away around them .  | I see a man of thirty , so crippled in body and so discouraged in heart for I believe he is greatly discouraged at last , though he still pretends he is not and tries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have no energy left to rule . I see a man of twenty , strong and vigorous and , yes , let me admit it , handsome , generous , kindly , and appealing , though of limited brain , wishing harm to no one , friendly to allI see this amiable but inadequate man trying to administer the Two Lands for his listless brother . Was there ever such a pair tried to lead a modern nation ? And will it not be right and fitting in the eyes of Amon , and of all the gods , when their puny and pathetic charade is put at last to end ? So do I believe , and for that day I work . Now there is battle in the Familythey conceal it from the servants , who learn all thingsover the tombs of Huy and Meryra . It would be a minor issue in any reign but this . Now , I think , it has suddenly become a symbol of everything , the issue on which the Living Horns may be brought to ground . I am ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be High Priest of Amon in the temple of Karnak when the great days return , is here . My mother Queen Tiye invited me to go with her this time to AkhetAten , and I was bored in Thebes , so I came . But she has not invited me to accompany her to the North Palace tonight , so I can only speculate what is going to happen there . At first I was annoyed by this , but then I thought : One more family row , this one probably the most bitter we have ever had with my peculiar brother . I am probably well off out of it . I have had enough wrangling and disputation over the years . The last battle of wills can proceed without me . At thirty-eight the QueenPrincess Sitamon is beginning to reach an age where she is just as happy not to be involved in angry things . I shall hear the results soon enough . Sometimes I look back on these three years since my father died and marvel at what has happened in the land of Kemet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ married me when I was very young in order to secure his own legitimacy to the throne ( the Double Crown passing , as  | it does , through the female line , though I sometimes wonder what good that does us , who have no real right of our own to happiness but must always be subject to whoever marries us ) . He spent most of his life enjoying the luxuries our ancestors handed down to him and managed by his amiable ways to persuade the people that this was good government . Already Kemet looks back with heavy longing to the " golden age " of the Good God Amonhotep III ( life , health , prosperity ! ) . They call him " Amonhotep the Magnificent " now , forgetting how he lolled away the Empire and let civil government slip , beginning all the things my poor brother has carried grimly on to the point of near destruction . But in retrospect , as with most rulers whose people perceive their personal foibles and are so astounded to find them human that they gladly forgive them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favorable light . " We loved your father ! " they shout at me when I pass in procession , adding commendation for him to the obvious love I can truly say they bear for me . I have never quite shouted back , " So did I ! " such informality does not become a royal princess and Queen to Pharaohbut they can tell from my expression that our sentiments coincide . Their shouts of joy redouble and they always conclude by looking sad because he is gone forever and they can not have him back . Such unity with the people as our father had , Akhenaten has never achieved , except in the very early days when he first returned to public view after his ailment , and when he married Nefertiti . For a brief year or two they had such adoration as only my father and mother enjoyed , excepting one difference : my father and the Great Wife had it as long as he lived , and she has it still , whereas poor Akhenatenand poor Nefertiti , whom I have come to feel dreadfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a fleeting moment and then lost it forever . I suppose I have become so sympathetic toward my cousin Nefertiti because to some extent my situation parallels hers . You will remember that for many years I and he who turned out to be my cousin Horemheb have been lovers . I helped him keep this secret , bore him three children whom I had to dispose of , since I was married to my father ( in name only , but nonetheless irrevocably ) and it was thus impossible for us to acknowledge one another openly , however open our secret eventually became in the Court and , I suppose , in the Two Lands . Then Horemheb ( " Kaires , " as we knew him then ) declared himself to be Horemheb , son of my uncle Aye ; my father died ; and I assumed naive girl that I was at thirty-five ! that all was now clear for us to announce our love and be married by my brother , who gave me his bless-  | ing after enjoying the pleasure of frightening me for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the glad news back to Horemheb it was suddenly no longer as simple as it had always seemed . Horemheb , I began to perceive , had other plans . He was , I found , not so eager as I to rush into marriage . He was not , in fact , eager to rush into it at all . He preferred , he said , to keep " our loving relationship , " as he called it , exactly where it wasofficially secret , officially unacknowledged , officially no restriction upon him at all . He told me this was necessary because his duties as general and chief scribe of the army took him too often from home . These journeys had never interfered with us before , and I could not see why they should now . But he was adamant , and although I perhaps could have tried to insist , we both knew it would probably not succeed . It would require my brother 's full support , and Horemheb and I both know I do not have it ; and Horemheb would have to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brother 's command to be effective . Above all , my brother would have to be a much different and more powerful Pharaoh than he is . He would have to be more like Horemheb . In fact , I said almost as much the other day and apparently hit closer to the mark than Horemheb found comfortable . " You treat me as though you were some Pharaoh ! " I shot out angrily in the midst of our most recent quarrel on the subject . For a second he looked at me with complete and almost ludicrous dismay : he actually turned pale . He grasped my arm so tightly that it hurt , which is what he meant it to do . I can not be quite so melodramatic as to say he hissed at me , but it was certainly a furtive and emphatic sound . " Do n't you ever say that again ! " he ordered in a savage whisper . " Do n't you ever say that again ! " I gave him stare for stare , since I am daughter and wife of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment I was genuinely frightened by the enormous suppressed anger in his voice . I have been his wife in all but name for almost fifteen years , borne him three childrenand now I no longer think I even really know him . Except that I know one thing now , after that exchange . He wants to be Pharaoh and fully intends to be , if he can . Somewhere down the years we have lost Horemheb , toobright , cheerful , willing " Kaires " who came mysteriously and unexpectedly to the Palace of Malkata and charmed us all with his enthusiasm , diligence and idealism . He loved Kemet then , and I think he loves her now ; but down the years he has also become enamored of power . I think he thinks he wants it only that he may better serve Kemet . And perhaps this is true : but , men being men , perhaps it is not , entirely .  | Power for its own sake is enormously attractive , particularly when , as is the case with my headstrong brother , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In any case , the quarrel did not advance the cause of our marriage , for which I have now almost abandoned hope . If he will not marry me , he will not , and there is little I can do about it . He talks vaguely of marriage " later , when it is more fitting . " But when is " later , " and when will it be " more fitting " ? In the meantime , he says firmly , we will continue as we are . Unfortunately this , too , I will accept , because I suffer from the same disease as Nefertiti : I love him , as she still loves my poor , misguided brother , against all fitness , logic and common sense about what is best for us , not them . There was a time long ago when I rather made fun of my perfect cousin Nefertiti , always so steady , so cool , so icy calm and self-contained in the face of all adversity . No hair was out of place on that beautiful head , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Each eyelash was in perfect order above those lovely , contemplative eyes . Nothing seemed to disturb the serenity of the remote and impregnable fortress of her being . But I learned , in time , that a woman as vulnerable as any lived inside the fortress , and I came to admire her for the great dignity with which she conducts herself in the very difficult situation in which she lives now . My brother is in his special world , my younger brother has followed him there , and now only the youngest of all , solemn little Tut , stands between the House of Thebes and extinction . Tutand , of course , my mother the Great Wife , my uncle Aye , and my cousin Horemheb . But Tut carries the blood of Ra in direct line , and he it is who will rule next . . . if , as now seems steadily more possible , some move is made to remove our two brothers from the throne . I feel sorry for Smenkhkara , who goes smiling and amiable through the world like our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the eternal order and ma'at of Kemet . Our father also had Queen Tiye , of course , and Smenkhkara has only sour little Merytaten , who tries to lord it over us all and pretend that she is a greater Queen than any of us . This is nonsense , and I hope the gods will render her suitable justice when the time comes . Why Akhenaten permits it I do not know , unless it be some lingering feeling that it looks more fitting to have a woman in the King 's House . He does not seem to feel the necessity in other respects , but it may be he wants her there for ceremonial reasons . And in her waspish little way she does have a good head for household management . Par-en-refer , the major-domo , is a careless old man behind whose back all sorts of thieving and cheating goes on among the ser-  | vants , particularly in the purchase and distribution of foodstuffs for the palaces . I do not know how much is spirited away to the servants ' families every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At least Merytaten tries to keep that under control . Her nagging voice is often raised to Par-en-nefer , and he can then be seen bustling busily and angrily away , protesting as he goes that he will " set all to rightsset all to rights ! " These reforms last a day or two and the pilfering begins again . I do not envy my niece her task , though this is the only sympathy I can find in my heart for her pinched and spiteful personality . So Smenkhkara has no one to help him keep his balance in a situation in which I do not think he has ever really wanted to preserve it anyway . I think he has been quite content from the beginning , being lazy and easygoing and also adoring his older brother , who did not hesitate to take advantage of this . Now they pretend to rule the country , though actually it is the Great Wife , our uncle Aye and Horemheb who carry out the orders , and indeed originate them , half the time . Were I Akhenaten I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he shows us , he does not appear to be . He drifts along : Smenkhkara drifts along : the Two Lands drift along . Smenkhkara makes some pretense of running things , makes his trips to Thebes and Memphis , issues proclamations and decrees in Akhenaten 's name , prides himself on being , as he confided to me recently , " our brother 's eyes and ears . " Real power resides where it has resided for many years , with my mother , my uncle and , lately , Horemheb . They do not quite dare challenge Akhenaten openly , for he is after all the Living Horus , Son of the Sun , King and Pharaoh of the Two Lands . By adoption , as it were , Smenkhkara has comparable , if somewhat lesser , stature . It takes muchvery muchfor anyone to openly challenge Pharaoh . It has been done , in our history , but only after the most grievous and long-continuing provocations . And it has not been done until those who did it were sure they could win . The vengeance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brother , does not fall lightly on those who fail in such a revolutionary and awesome attempt . Now , however , I suspect the attempt may be made . It is a possibility I hardly dare think about , so terrible are its implications and so awful its consequences , no matter who wins . To overturn a Pharaoh is to shake to the very foundations the being of Kemet , for Pharaoh is all things to Kemet . Such an act violates the very ma'at of the Two Lands . Only a Pharaoh who himself has violated ma'at could ever be threatened with such a thing . Tonight , I suspect , may be the start of it , though I do not expect the  | event itself to occur then . There will be a last attempt to reason with my older brother , who is responsible , and with my younger brother , who is not responsible but only the amiable and appealing dull-wit he has always been . If that fails , then I shudder to think what may happen next in the land of Kemet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paintings on two tomb walls . Around them rise issues so grave and great that their settling can convulse the earth from the Delta to the Fourth Cataract . Knowing my mother , my uncle , my cousin Horemheb , Nefertiti and my two dreaming brothers , I expect the worse . But I do not want to be there . I shall walk by the Nile and try to think of peaceful things ; though I think it will be long , now , before peace returns to the Two Lands ... . I have never known him to be so intent , so silent , so secretive about his plans , his purposes , his feelings . Always up to now Horemheb , my dearest friend and most trusted comrade in arms , has confided all to me , things he would never confide even to Sitamon , to whom he has been husband in all but name these many years . I have known him myself for thirty years , ever since the day of Akhenaten 's birth when I brought to Thebes the news of the murder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was the then Crown Prince Tuthmose V. We were young scribes together , young soldiers together , traveled the length of Kemet and from there north to Mittani and Naharin , south to Nubia and wretched Kush , in the service of His late Majesty Amonhotep III ( life , health , prosperty ! ) . In the past fifteen years we have faithfully served ( though with many profound misgivings which we have expressed only to one another ) Nefer-Kheperu-Ra Akhenaten . Horemheb has been a part of my family , he is godfather to my son Seti , who now stands tall and sturdy beside us , ready for whatever the future may bring . He and I might be brothers , even twins , so closely have our lives , our thoughts , our hearts run together : and even I do not know what inner pressures move him now . I do know that something must be done . I say this bluntly and without embellishment , for I am not a clever man , I admit it . I am simply a  | fair scribe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overmuch with policy . But policy is everyone 's concern now . NeferKheperu-Ra has made it so . The Empire is almost gone , the Two Lands slip away into chaos and confusion . Robbery and corruption , murder and mayhem fill the cities and plague the villages . The temples of the gods stand ruined and deserted , the priests who helped administer government are dispersed , dead or in hiding . Many civil officials can not be trusted unless they are directly supervised by the army . Even in the army itself Horemheb and I must be constantly on the alert to guard against corruption and betrayal . Men look only to their own self-interest : the love of Kemet wanes because the heart of Kemet no longer beats . Akhenaten is the heart , and he is no longer interested in Kemet . Sad days haunt the kingdom because of this . Horemheb and I do what we can . Together with Horemheb 's half brother , the Vizier Nakht-Min , we strive to keep all on even keel while Akhenaten lives in his dream of the Aten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emptyheaded boy of twenty , for such a task ! It would make one laugh aloud were it not so tragic . But what to do about it ? There we are frustrated and do not know . I know there are some who whisper that there are plots within the Family against the two Pharaohs , that the Great Wife , the Councilor and Divine Father-in-law Aye , Horemheb , even Nefertiti , may be planning some action looking toward their removal . I do not believe it , for how can it be done ? They are the Sons of the Sun . It would violate the eternal laws of Kemet . It would desolate the very ka and ba , the very soul and essence of the country would be destroyed by it . I , a simple soldier , would go mad with the rending of the world . So would most of our five millions of people . We would be lost and wandering in the eternal darkness of the universe and Ra would no more smile upon us . It could not be . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this burden . Somehow the Two Lands must be restored to their glory . Somehow the people must be protected from the corrupt , the murderous , the avaricious and the hurtful . Somehow the Double Crown must regain its splendor in the hands of decent and honorable men . Somehow the gods must be restored . . . . Horemheb asked me to return with him to Akhet-Aten from Memphis , where we were seeking to strengthen the hands of a few faithful servants in the northern capital . He did not tell me why , except to say , as he always does , " Because I need you with meI must  | have one man I can trust at my right hand . " I do not know his plans , his purposes , his feelings : but I know , as always , that I must be here to help him in whatever he intends . He tells me there is some argument over paintings in the tombs of Huy and Meryra . Akhenaten wants them one way , the Great Wife and Nefertiti want them another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about this . I sense , though he does not tell me , that Horemheb considers it to be a major issue ; though being a simple soldier , I do not really see why . I asked him as much . " Because it is time , " he said . And that is all he would say . I can not believe it will change things . How could it ? The Living Horus , Son of the Sun , can not be toppled by such a paltry thing . The people would not permit it , unhappy and fearful though they have been made by the strange misrule of Nefer-Kheperu-Ra and Ankh-KheperuRa . And how could any of us who love Kemet lend ourselves to so dreadful an overturn of all her traditions that hold us together ? Simple Ramesses is baffled by me , which I would like to think is more a tribute to my cleverness than his stupidity . I fear it is not , however . I think it is only because he is honest , dull and blinded by lifelong loyalty that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to conduct myself with extra circumspection in the sight of others , less close , who observe me more objectively . In this I think I have succeeded very well up to this moment of final conflict with my irresponsible cousin . For fifteen years I have gone faithfully about his business in the Two Lands , and beyond . He has raised me to be chief scribe and general of the army , has used me with unhesitating trust to perform his will , has required of me that I do terrible things : and I have done them . From the murder of our uncle Aanen in the temple of Amon at Luxor to the murder of Mayathe desecration of Anion 's holiest place at Karnakthe hurling of Amon himself into the waters of the Nileand the ruin and dispersion of all the other gods and their priesthoodsI have done them . And somehow , although I have been the instrument , I have secretly been able to con-  | vince the victims that I am their friend and , like them , am biding only the time when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have come through unscathed and still popular with the secret priesthoods and the people . It is as though I had acquired something of the aura that Pharaohs have : that whatever seemingly false I do is blamed on someone else ( as rightly it should , in my case ) , and that to me is accorded a great forgiveness such as is not given other men . Particularly such as is not given Akhenaten , I think ; and again , rightly so . All of this has required great subtlety , great cleverness , the ruthless leading of a shrewd and implacable double life . It has also required great courage , because not even such a listless and uncaring One as Nefer-Kheperu-Ra could afford to countenance such behavior , if he knew it . He would have had my head on a dozen occasions had I not been able to advance my purposes with the requisite amount of grace and bravery . That I have been able to do so safely has convinced me further , if I needed to be convinced , that the gods have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years agothirty , how the time rolls by ! Amonhotep , Son of Hapu , said to me when he first became my friend that he thought I did indeed have " purposes " in Kemet . I was only fifteen then , newly come to Thebes and all the dazzle of the Court . I knew I possessed great brains , a stout heart , wit , charm , a lightning intelligenceand the skill to dissemble , which I did not at first employ because I did not see any particular reason why I should . But as I rose higher , I learned . My father Aye was secretly guiding me , more by example than by direct admonition . Amonhotep , Son of Hapu , as he moved more and more securely into the position he now occupies ( which is really " the official Sage of Kemet , " so widely is he known , loved , listened to and revered ) , gave me many direct and helpful admonitions that greatly eased my way . My father 's support guaranteed me position , his example schooled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Hapu , I received the intimate guidance and warm day-by-day friendship my father 's high position and remote austerity made impossible . I owe them both very much : and will continue to owe them much , I think , as I move closer to the destiny whose shape the gods have made clear to me beyond all doubt in these last few troubled years . Sitamon knows . Her shot was in the dark , but I could see she sensed instantly how shrewdly it had gone home . I do want to be Pharaoh : I , lloremheb , say it secretly to myself and not yet to any other . But the clay will come when it can be proclaimed to the world . When it does , I will be ready . How this will come about I do not yet see , for at the moment the  | path to the Double Crown is not open to me , who am the illegitimate son of Aye , who is only uncle and father-in-law to the King and is not able , himself , to confer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given me the right of legitimacy , and he has given me the right to be a member of the Family . Both have been great advantages : but he can not give me the right to the throne . Yet I feel that somehow the gods will work on my behalf , as I work secretly and shrewdly on theirs . Somehow I shall not go unrewardedthis I believe . In that belief I live and govern and do great things , though always , up to now , at the command , and in the shadow of , my strange cousin and his amiable , empty brother . Suppose the day comes when they are removedyes , that too I dare say secretly to myself , though it is treason to even think it : when they are removed . What will happen then ? Solemn little Tut , who used to be such a happy child before he became old enough to sense that the world of Kemet is deeply in trouble around him , will succeed . He will be married to Akhenaten 's second oldest daughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much smoother edges ) ; and from his loins will no doubt spring many sons to revive the House of Thebes . And what will happen to hopeful Horemheb then ? Will he succeed his father as councilor , when that good man goes ? Will he continue to run the army and govern the country while Tut remains a child , and go finally to the afterworld , gray with honors , after Tut takes full command and presently permits an old and faithful servant to retire ? This is a future most men would greatly envy : but it is not enough for Horemheb . Still , as I say , that is what appears to be the likely outline of the future . I see no other path logically before me . Yet I still believe the gods will come to my assistance and make me Pharaoh . How , I do not know . For the present , I suppose , I am not intended to know . I am intended only to play my part in the crisis that is now upon us , and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ save the throne and the Two Lands , which now suffer so greatly under my cousin 's misrule . That is enough for me , right nowor so Amon and his fellow gods inform me . I pray often to Amon , whose statue I ordered to be recovered secretly from the Nile after Akhenaten ordered him thrown in . Hatsuret my fatherthe Great WifeAmonhotep , Son of HapuRamesses we six alone in all the world know where Amon is , for after the special group of divers I commanded had brought him up from the bottom of the Nile , I had them slain so that there would be no witnesses . Ramesses and I then took him to a secret place in the necropolis of  | Sakkara , near Memphis , where he stands in an empty tomb carved more than a thousand years ago for some noble who never occupied it . It is at the end of a tiny passage leading off from my own , which has been under construction in Sakkara for many years . After I had the passage dug , the tomb enlarged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a concealed doorway fitted cleverly into place , I had those workmen slain also . Now , as I say , only six in this world know where Amon is ; and only I , who have the pretext of visiting my own tomb from time to time to supervise its progress , ever have the chance to visit him . But I take the offerings of the others , and he knows that all of us work toward the day of his restoration , and he favors us in our endeavors and guides us in what we do . So does he guide us now as we come finally toward the day of reckoning with the treacherous Aten and his foolish servitors . My cousin has tried for fifteen years to make the Aten the Sole God of Kemet , he has persecuted Amon and all the other gods , he has had his subversive and ridiculous Hymn to the Aten inscribed on a hundred stelae throughout Kemetand still the people do not love the Aten , any more than they love him . But this does not stop him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his Sole God and try to inflict him upon the rest of us . He will continue this to his death : for such is the nature of my cousin Akhenaten . In a curious way , it is almost possible to admire such stubborn determination , however foolish and self-defeating it has been . His whole life since he became Co-Regent with my uncle Amonhotep III ( life , health , prosperity ! ) has been a deliberate challenge to all the ancient traditions of Kemet . He has defied the weight of history : he has risked the wrath of centuries . And now that he nears the end of his rule and his life , for certainly he does , one can only ask : for what ? Has he really had a purpose ? Has he really known what he was doing ? Or has he been simply the creature of an automatic and increasingly insane compulsion , without strategy , without aim , without sense ? I believe , myself , that he is insane . I have believed this ever since the day of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amon , put aside Nefertiti and sailed off to Akhet-Aten from Thebes with silly , bewitched Smenkhkara singing the Hymn to the Aten at his side . I think on that day he relinquished whatever shreds of reason still remained in him . I think on that day the gods sealed his fate , and that everything thereafter has been simply preparation for the final ending of his crazy dream . In this ending I have much part to play . I do not know yet exactly what it will be , what the Great Wife and my father will wish of me ; but  | I feel , though neither has talked to me about it , that both know well what they intend . The army is in my hand , though it would take almost impossibly much to make my superstitious soldiers rise against the Living Horusand so I know it is not by that means that we will bring him down . But bring him down we will . Of that I have no doubt . And then in due timesomehow , someday , in some fashion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know they will , for I am their faithful servantthe way will open for Horemheb and he will lead Kemet back to what Kemet was when he first arrived , an eager lad , in then flourishing Thebes , so many years ago . My sister thinks it time , my son thinks it time , I think it time , Amonhotep , Son of Hapu , though he confides nothing direct to any of us about it , indicates the same . We do not know what my daughter Nefertiti thinks but tonight we intend to find out . Then , perhaps , will indeed come the timeto act . Yet what do I contemplate when I say " the time to act " ? My mind shudders away from it . We say we are talking about two carvings in two minor tombs of the pathetic coronation durbar and what they should represent to posterity . In reality we are talking of something else . Behind them lies the face of death . So far we have come along the road with Nefer-Kheperu-Ra and his bemused and fatefully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who so short a while ago laughed and tumbled at my feet ! Of them I use the word " death ! " May Amon and Aten and all the gods forgive me the thought . . . and may they understand , in horror and compassion , why it is that Aye , Private Secretary , Councilor , Divine Father-in-law , must now face the fact that for him , as for others , it is a thought that can no longer be put aside . It is not enough to catalogue the wasting of temples , the withering of empire , the corruption of the land . It is not enough to talk of gods destroyed , of brothers shameless in public spectacle , of old ways thwarted and traditions upside down . It is more than that . It is ma'at , the fitness  | of things in all its aspects , that Akhenaten destroys with what he does . . . . It is this he destroys now simply by continuing to exist , simply by continuing to be the living symbol of all that he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Two Lands . I have tried for a very long time to follow him , rationalizing much , excusing much , justifying much . When he asked me to stand at his right hand years ago as assistant high priest of the Aten , I did so , thinking I could thereby modify and guide and in some measure control his course . When I publicly recognized my son Horemheb and advised him to accept the honors and responsibilities his cousin desired to heap upon him , I did so in the thought , which Horemheb shared , that this too would be a modifying , guiding and controlling influence . It has not proven so , in either case . Were it not that Kemet long ago came to respect and revere my integrity and intelligencenot giving me love , but giving me something I value more because in my mind it is more important , namely respectI should now myself be suffering the secret grumblings , the growing fear and hatred that surround Pharaoh in the minds of his people . Were it not that Horemheb , too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his loyalty , his great shrewdness and his obvious deep love for Kemet , he would be suffering in the same way . Fortunately we have been able to escape opprobrium , retaining both the people 's confidence and Pharaoh 's , and it is this which not only gives us the opportunity but imposes upon us the obligation to assist in whatever is decided tonight . We will , in fact , assist in the deciding itself , for we are come now to the moment when all must be decided so that Kemet may be reborn and go on in the eternal glory that is rightfully hers . We have wasted too much time : the Two Lands have drifted too far . Now , very late , we must pull them back . In this enterprise my sister is the guiding force , as she has been the guiding force in so many things for the good of Kemet for so many years . I doubt if even now , confronted though we are by so many failures and misdeeds of Akhenaten , we should dare to even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's indomitable character and implacable will . I can only imagine the endless hours , days , nights of torment she must have gone through these past three years to reach the point she has : for she was always a loving mother , and she , too , has traveled far , very far , with Nefer-Kheperu-Ra and Ankh-Kheperu-Ra before coming at last to the conclusion I think she has : that , for the good of Kemet , they must go .  | What form this will take we do not knowdo not dare express as yet , though I think tonight we will . Possibly the gods will come to our aid and it will happen naturally , for Akhenaten is not well , that is obvious to all . He seems to be suffering not so much a sickness of the body , though of course he has never been really strong since his illness , as a sickness of the spirit . He is listless , more erratic , more uncaring . With it comes a sharper tongue , an inward-turning sarcasm , a more savage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the time he stays alone and broods ; now and again he calls me or Horemheb or my younger son , Nahkt-Min , whom he has now appointed vizier , to his side for halfhearted discussions of policy and government . More often he goes to worship the Aten with Smenkhkara and then they retreat to his favorite aerie , the ledge along the Northern Tombs overlooking the city and plain . At regular intervals Smenkhkara I will say for him that he takes his " duties of government " with an almost touching earnestness and sinceritytravels upriver to Thebes or down to Memphis , makes his appearances at those two secondary and now half-deserted capitals , performs the ceremonies of the Aten and transmits a few desultory " orders " from his brother , so vaguely phrased that only ancient habits of obedience bring them even a semblance of response . " That canal for His Majesty 's commerce near the oasis of the Fayum might be deepened , " perhaps . Or , " It might be that an expedition to the western desert would find items pleasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you see . Notan expedition will go and it will find thus , thus and thus for His Majesty . It is all a half formed hint , a delicate , weary suggestionalmost , if you will , a dying suggestion . This is not how Pharaohs get things done . It is only in the realm of his religion and his household , unfortunately , that he still remains vigorous and demanding . The temples of the Aten flourish , though they have few worshipers . The wealth of Amon and the rest flow into their coffers , and from there directly into his . The compromise I once suggested that the wealth and priesthoods of the two great gods be equally dividedvanished with the blaze of rage in which he destroyed Amon at Thebes on the day of his father 's entombment . It was not a very good compromise , probably , but at least for a year or two it did what I had hoped , prevented open conflict , preserved a semblance of uneasy peace between the two , re-established a little the mystique of Pharaoh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was never impartial , really . Too long ago he became the slave of the Aten . And now he permits no other god to reign in the Two Lands , as  | he permits no other god than likable , amiable , stupidly easygoing Ankh-Kheperu-Ra to reign in his heart . Is it any wonder we of the Family feel so torn about them both ? Akhenaten has a great residue of love and pity to draw upon in our hearts , for he was so perfect a youth and became so pathetic and unhappy a man . Smenkhkara has always been everyone 's favorite , because of his own sweet nature and because the blessings the gods gave him were never taken away . In many ways he is a replica of his father , tolerant , friendly , outgoing , lovable . I have sometimes thought it , never dared speak it even to myself , but now I do : it is a pity the terrible illness did not take Akhenaten and leave us Smenkhkara to succeed to the Double Crown . There would have been no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no problems of any kind . He would have married , had sons , done his duty ; he might even have taken to the field and restored the Empire , for he has his venturesome streak and sometimes talks longingly of the campaigns he would like to go on if only his brother were not too jealous of his safety to permit it . He would have been good , kind , reliable , dull : just one more greatly popular , greatly respected , greatly loved Pharaoh , easily managed and easily controlled , taking his place in the eternal unchanging parade of Kemet 's rulers . Instead came Akhenaten . .. . And here we are . I do not know exactly what my sister has in mind for this evening , but I think in the family council that will be held before we confront the two Kings the basic question will have to be put : are they to be removed , and if so , how and by whom ? I know that in the King 's House there are two instruments , once the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his heart Amon 's burning desire for vengeance . And at the right hand of His Majesty stands my son Horemheb , whose ambition at last is beginning to frighten me , so boundless does it appear to be despite his outward dissemblings . It is not often that Sitamon and I make occasion to speak on an intimate basis : she is a good niece , I am a good uncle , our friendship is always amicable , we leave it at that . It is seldom she seeks me out for counsel or advice . Two weeks ago she did , however , telling me of her strange little exchange with Horemheb , which she thoughtand I agree with herrevealed his desire to be Pharaoh . Yet how can he be Pharaoh ? The line of succession is firm and clear , going straight to solemn little Tut , more uneasy every day as he senses the concern of his elders increasing about him .  | " Uncle , " he said to me just yesterday , when I was visiting the North Palaceclimbing up on my lap as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so easy , as he is growing rapidly heavier and I am in my sixty-fifth year " must I be Pharaoh very soon , when Nefer-Kheperu-Ra and Ankh-Kheperu-Ra die ? " For a moment I was so taken aback by this childish candor on a subject his elders have never yet expressed aloud to one another that I am afraid I must have looked a little foolish . " They are going to die , are n't they ? " he repeated with a bright insistence that suddenly frightened me so that I instinctively clapped a hand over his mouth . His startled eyes stared at me with such terror that I knew I must drop my hand instantly and hug him protectively to my chest . " You must never , never , never say such things , Nephew , " I said , managing with great efforr to make my voice calm and soothing to stop the trembling of his body and the surprised and terrified little noises that were beginning to whimper from his throat . " Nefer-Kheperu-Ra and Ankh-Kheperu-Ra are the Kings of the Two Lands . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Someday far , far off when you are a grown man and are married and have a family " a thought I try to instill in him every chance I get , since we do not want any repetitions of what is going on now " it may be that the god will call them to the Western Peak " " Which god ? " he demanded . " The Aten or Amon ? " " Perhaps both , " I said soothingly . " I should like the Aten , " he said with a surprising firmness that brought a sudden terror to my heart . That repetition I had not foreseen . But he is only eight , and no doubt will presently forget it , and so I made my tone again deliberately hearty and comforting . " Perhaps the Aten , perhaps Amon , perhaps both , " I said with a studied indifference . " One does not know what the future holds , except that , as you truly say , you will indeed be Pharaoh when Nefer-Kheperu-Ra and Ankh-Kheperu-Ra are no longer on this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from now , and you must never discuss it with anyone , ever again . It does not become one who will one day be Pharaoh that he should gossip thus about his brothers . " This did what I intended it to do . He straightened up abruptly and slid off my lap , standing straight as a little soldier at my elbow . " The Pharaoh Tutankhaten , " he said solemnly , " will never gossip about his brothers to anyone again . " " That is good , " I said with equal solemnity . " Have I the word of a Son of the Sun on that ? "  | " You have the word of a Son of the Sun , " he said , still with great solemnity . Then he gave a sudden sad sigh and became a little boy again . " But , Uncle , I do wish we could all be happy together in the Family as we used to be . " " So do I , Nephew , " I said , meeting the honesty in his eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ godsallows us to be so , we must all be strong and brave and show the world nothing and say nothing about it , not even to one another . Do you not agree ? " " I agree , " he said , sounding much too old and tired for eight . " But I do wish it so . " " Come , " I said then , rising and taking him by the hand . " Let us go and look at the lion captured last week in the Fayum . They tell me he has a marvelous growl that says , Tut-ankh-AAATTTEN ! Tut-ankhAAATTTEN ! ' " " Uncle , " he said , breaking into the sunny smile we do not see very often of late , " that 's silly . But let us go anyway and see him . " And so we did , and the subject , I hoped , was forgotten ; though I am very much afraid it was not , for I saw him just this morning being taken in his chariot to the House of the Aten to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once again knowing and troubled and far too old for eight . How Horemheb can contemplate that he will ever become Pharaoh under these circumstances , I can not for the life of me see . It is as absurd as though I myself were to entertain such a thought . The succession is established and preordained . What we must all be thinking about now is how to bring it about as rapidly as possible , with as little disturbance to Kemet and with ( I still hope with all my heart ) as little hurt as possible to Akhenaten and Smenkhkara . There is a possibilitya very remote chancethat they might be persuaded to leave the throne . No Pharaoh has ever done such a thing voluntarilyin all our history . But I am not talking of voluntarily . Perhaps we can trade them the throne for retirement together here , suitably housed , suitably honored , remaining as guardians of the Aten in the Aten 's city , while Tut returns to Thebes to re-establish Amon and restore the ma'at and power of the Two Lands But what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ease and luxury might agree . But embittered and unyielding Akhenaten ? Never . What ever persuaded Aye , who has seen so much of tragedy and unhappiness in the House of Thebes ( and I am afraid will yet see more ) , to entertain for even a moment such blithering thoughts !  | My desperate desire for compassion and compromise runs away with me . There is no easy way around this situation for any of us . We gather in my daughter 's palace an hour from now , and there we decide how best to go straight through , hoping we may somehow come out safely on the other side . I am getting old . I find that I am thinking often now , with frequent tears and deepening sadness , of the old bright days before trouble came upon this House . We were happy then . All was laughter , gaiety and pleasure . Nothing clouded our sky , from which Ra smiled benignly on us all . The world was filled with life and love and brilliant colors everywhere . Contentmentreal contentmentblessed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Two Lands . I see the contrast in far too many things today . To take one example : the temples . " Colors everywhere , " I said . Do you , too , remember how the great pylons looked , the giant figures of Pharaoh and the gods striding across the stone , painted in vivid reds and blues and yellows , with lovely gold and scarlet banners flying from every aperture ? The palaces were lovely too , corridors , floors , doors , ceilings painted with a thousand scenes of gods , of Pharaoh , of comfortable domestic things and carefree hunting and fishing along the Nile . And on the river the bright sails going up and down , and in the streets the busy , happy bustle of our handsome people , the men dark and deeply tanned , the women fair , protected from the sun , gracefully languorous as they were carried by in litters and couches or , if assigned by the gods to a lower station in life , yet moving gracefully about their burdens with happy smiles , quick laughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A drabness has come upon the land . Since my son closed all the temples save those of his jealous Sole God , the work crews that once kept all bright and shining with their constant attentions have been dispersed . Care and love are gone from the world . The colors of the giant statues and paintings on all temples but the Aten 's have faded and become splotchy , the banners are long since taken down and destroyed , the palaces themselves have been allowed to fall  | into shabby disrepair save in a few places where the orders of myself and Nefertiti have been able to preserve some semblance of former beauty . ( She built her own temple to the Aten at Karnak . He did not dare object . It stands alone , a single note of brightness in the ruined surround . ) On the river there is less and less color as if the boatmen were afraid to show it , and in the streets few smiles , little laughter , no longer the constant happy chattermingled so often with the sound of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to fill Kemet with good will and laughter from Memphis to Karoy . A sullen sourness grips the land , a deep unease . Joy has fled from Kemet and with it the air of well-being that used to be the principal distinguishing feature of our divinely ordered life . It is because there is no order that this is so . It is because orderma'atthe eternal fitness of thingshas been destroyed . It is because my son has remade our world in his own sad image and that of his hurtful , vengeful god . Long ago when his father and I first decided that we would dedicate him to the Aten , we intended the Aten to be a counterweight to then overweening Amon . We never contemplated that out of Akhenaten 's illness would come his great hatred for Amon and the other gods , or that out of his worship of the Aten would come his final decision to overturn them all and make the Aten , alone , supreme . Now the Aten is inescapable . His round , empty face and long spidery arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look down upon us everywhere ; and to him my son has given titles heretofore reserved for Pharaohs alone when they have celebrated jubilees of their reigns : " Live , Ra , ruler of the Horizon , rejoicing in the Horizon , in his role of light coming from the Sun 's Disk , giving life forever and to all eternity , Aten the living , the Great , Lord of Jubilees , Master of all that encompasses the Sun 's Disk , Lord of the Heavens , Lord of the Earth , THE ATEN . " So high has he raised him . I know he still conceives the Aten to be a sunny , bright and loving god . But seeing what has been done in Aten 's name , it has been long since the Aten has appeared that way to our people . In Akhenaten 's eyesfor he has told me so on many occasionshis " Father Aten " still gleams happy and beneficent above us all . In the eyes of the people he is a dark and vindictive god whose jealousy and intolerance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the tragedy of my son Akhenaten . And such is the tragedy of our ! louse , which now must deal with him , since the people can not and will not , so deeply instilled in them lies the fear and worship of  | Pharaoh , even when they knowknowwhat he is doing to the land . They would never dare rise against him ; they would never dare risk the vengeance of centuries . In the land of Kemet , this is not done . Yet it must be done ; and I , his mother , for many years Pharaoh in all but name of the Two Lands , must now perform a terrible service for my people . Nothing will be done unless I give the word : the Family waits upon me . So I must give the word , because there is no one else to give it , and nothing else left to do . I see them both , in those early happy days : Akhenaten running and leaping down the sandy pathways of Malkata , ten years old , shortly before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my arms , suckling at my breast , beaming upon all the world with happy smiles and welcoming gurgles . They were such happy children . All my children have been happy children , though Sitamon is on her way to becoming a soured and disappointed old woman because marriage to her no longep has a place in Horemheb 's ambitions . . . and Tut is aging rapidly before his time as the weight of the Double Crown comes ever closer . . . and Beketaten goes about a shy and frightened little girl because she , too , senses gathering storms . . . and Akhenaten and Smenkhkara are far , far now from the innocent and carefree days when we all laughed and loved one another in harmony and happiness in the Palace of Malkata . .. . I envy my husband , sleeping peacefully in the Valley of the Kings beneath the Peak of the West , because he does not have to make the decision I must make . Were he alive , of course , he never would , because he was always weaker than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , as he did from so many unpleasant things that , looking back , were clearly unmistakable warnings . We used to worry about these things , sometimes sharing our worries , sometimes not , but each sensing the other 's concerns . From time to time it would come into the open : I would urge upon him some course of actioninsist upon it , finally , for the good of Kemet . Sometimes he would comply and sometimes not . When he did , things righted temporarily ; when he did not , they continued their downward slide . Never could he control Akhenaten , and as his health failed so steadily in those later years , he lost even the desire to try . So came the awful and disgraceful day of his entombment , the destruction of Amon and the other gods , the final ascendance of Akhenaten and the Aten , the putting aside of Nefertiti , the shameless enthronement of Smenkhkara in intimate co-regency with his brother , the full impact , at last , of all Akhenaten 's crazy dreams upon the Two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insane , and far gone now from any place where we who love him can reach him any more . I blame myself for this , as I blame us allbut myself most of all , for I am his mother and it must have been my failure , somehow , that started it all : though I can not honestly see how . I tried , I did my best . I have always thought to love and save him : but I failed . . . . The hours I have wept for him , the Niles of tears I have shed ! Even now , as I make ready to leave for the North Palace , I am shedding more . But something cold lies deep inside , at last . It is not my sonmy sonsI weep for any more . It is for two alien beings , and for us who at last must regard and treat them as such if Kemet is to be saved from their infinite and awful folly . I believe I have the support of my brother Aye , my nephew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am not so sure of my daughter-in-law , for I think her love still lives as it used to do , with something of the happy innocence of Malkata still alive beneath all the unhappy bitterness of these recent years . I think she also still believes in the Aten , which I have come to regard , I think realistically , as an experiment that failed . Had Akhenaten been stronger , more insistent , had he moved from the beginning to impose his will as a Pharaoh should , instead of being so gentle , so cautious , so anxious to win the people to Aten through love instead of fear , then he might have achieved the religious revolution he sought and rid our House forever of Amon . But he wanted the people to come to the Aten of their own free will and he waited too long for them to do it . Then when he finally became enraged and decided to force them , it was too late and he went too far . And so the Aten 's temples stand empty save for fawning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Court who must worship as Pharaoh directs if they would keep their positions , wealth and power . Among the people , Hatsuret and his spies tell uswe think accurately the time is ripe for Amon and his fellows to return . But before Amon can return my sons must go : the bargain of the gods is as simple and as ruthless as that . Later tonight we will confront the two Kings , ostensibly to argue out the question of what is to be placed in the tombs of Huy and Meryra to depict the coronation durbar . On the surface it will be an argument decided before it is begun , for Akhenaten of course will have the final say its long as he is Pharaoh . If he wishes to depict the durbar in all its pathetic " living in truth " reality , instead of as a dignified and opulent ceremony designed to strengthen and preserve through all eternity the  | hitherto glorious image of the Eighteenth Dynasty , then he can order it done . But before we argue that we will have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I think , have been reached ; and they may influence him far differently than he now dreams . My tears are drying as I prepare to go . They may never flow again for my sons or for their mother , who will perform her last service for her beloved land of Kemet though it kills her heart forever in the breast that nourished them . I have been first lady in waiting to Queen Nefertiti since we both were girls , and steadily in these past three years my heart has been wrung with pity for her , as hers has been wrung with sadness for her husband and the happy times they once knew together . I have watched her age , something I never thought could happen when we were younger ; and at the same time seen her become more beautiful , as maturity and suffering have eroded the youthful roundness and arrogant prettiness and transformed her into a stately , grave and truly beautiful woman . Bek 's rising young assistant Tuthmose has captured this best , I think , in the portrait bust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , looking out upon the world with a subtle sadness , a knowing but indomitable serenity , she gazes quietly into the eyes of the beholder as I have often seen her gaze in these past three troubled years . Only once have I caught that gaze direct , and then it was to look into such depths of sorrow that I quickly found a pretext to excuse myself and went away to weep in private for the beautiful woman who has come , only to find that all has crumbled and turned hopeless in her hands . For this I can never blame the Queen , for it is only Pharaoh who must bear the responsibility . Her fault , if any , has been in loving him too much , and continuing to do so long after all evidence and common sense said such devotion was foolish and fated to end in emptiness . She has refused to believe itrefuses , I think , even now . Of all the Court perhaps in all Kemetshe is the only one who still clings to the hope that someday , somehow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what would it profit her ? Nefer-Kheperu-Ra  | has not much longer to live , I think , and it is better that she be far from his side when the vengeance of the gods falls at last upon his head . This I believe it will , for I do not believe that even the Good God can so long and so outrageously challenge the gods and the very ka and ba , the very soul and essence , of the Two Lands , without coming eventually to judgment . In my opinion , though I know the Queen has always supported him in his heretical ideas ( something it took me long to forgive her , and only my deep love for her gentle person and my ever growing admiration for her indomitable character finally persuaded me to do so ) , judgment is long overdue . Vengeance will come , and it will destroy both Pharaohs . So are we told who still believe in Amon : and our number is as the sands of the Red Land , however much the Good God may have tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the strange unhappy time he has been on the throne . Fifteen yearsfifteen years ! To think we have had to suffer him for fifteen years ! They have flown so fast it seems impossible to believe it has been so longwere it not that the weary sorrow . Lny lady is as nothing to the weary sorrow of the land . We carry a constant depression in our hearts because of him . Laughter and joy are gone from Kemet . It has been long , too long , and retribution for it has been long , too long , in coming . I speak occasionally with him who is known in Akhenaten 's Southern Palace as Peneptah , meeting him casually at an appointed place in the market , appearing to the unnoticing passers-by to be chatting easily of ordinary domestic things . Secretly we exchange gossip and information as we seem to stand innocuously talking in the sun . I do not reveal to Hatsuret any of the private affairs of the Queen , for my loyalty is first to her , which he respects ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and so he tells me something of the whispers that are running through Kemet . We talk also of hidden things within the Family , which both of us are in position to overhear and to know . Vengeance is coming , he says ; and he told me only yesterday that it will come " from those closest to Pharaoh , whom he does not suspect . " He also told me that when I receive the sign from him " which before long I think you will " I should be prepared at once to disguise myself and the Queenas if one could disguise that classic face ! and flee to hiding in one of the villages south , toward Aswan . " Our quarrel is not with Her Majesty , " he said , " though Amon knows she has abetted and encouraged the Heretic enough , through all these years . But Amon will forgive her if she will go quietly and nevermore appear upon the public scene . A modest house and a quiet living will be prepared for her and for you , and for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There you may live out your days unknown and unmolested . But she must not hesitate . When I tell you , and you tell her go . Do not look back , either of you . Else will she , too , feel the vengeance of Amon , which is terrible and will devastate the land . " " Must there be more devastation ? " I asked , embittered . " Have we not had devastation enough ? Must Amon compound Aten , and bloody us all in the process ? Why will you not be content , HatsuretPeneptah " correcting myself as he gave me a hasty glare of warning " to simply reclaim the temples and the Two Lands from the Heretic ? Must you run the risk of ruining everything as he has , in the bargain ? " " Vengeance will not be complete until he is dead and all his doings laid waste as he has laid waste Amon and the other gods , " he said in a harsh and unforgiving tone . " You men love vengeance too much , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Two Lands ? " " So that the Sole God will die forever , " he said in the same cold way . " Forever and ever , for millions and millions of yearsso that no man hereafter will ever again dare to blaspheme and say that there is a single universal god supreme above all others . This is the reason we will destroy the Aten , and the Aten 's worshipers , and the sick cripple who has conceived blasphemy , and all his works of all kinds , forever . " " You can not destroy what is in men 's minds , Peneptah , " I said , " and though many condemn what he has planted there , not all will be able to forget it . It may outlive us all , for all your vengeance . " " First we will have the vengeance , " he said with a grim assurance , " and then we will see . " " I shall try to persuade Her Majesty as you suggest , " I said , dropping the subject because I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my prediction , which I think to be , unhappily , more likely to be true than his . " But I do not know that she will listen to me . It is not in her nature to flee . " " Then she will die with him , " he said with a cold indifference . " And you , too , unless you abandon her and return to Amon in time . " " I shall never abandon Her Majesty ! " I exclaimed , shocked into a loudness of tone that brought his hand instantly clamped upon my arm . " You will have the chance , " he said softly , " because you have been a loyal daughter of Amon . But it will not be offered twice . At the moment you receive word from me , in that moment you must decide . And so must she . There will be no second chance . " " You do not frighten me , Hatsuret , " I said in a whisper that trembled despite my attempt to keep it steady .  | " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frightened , " he said . " Amon is interested in justice . " " Vengeance ! " I snapped . " Vengeance only , not justice ! " " The two are the same , " he said with an indifferent shrug , and turned away to leave me staring after him with too much dismay on my face , for I soon became aware that several were giving me curious looks . I quickly gathered up the two earthen pots with their characteristic bluestriped design which were my excuse for being in the market , went to my waiting litter and was carried home to the North Palace through the city 's bustling streets . As we passed the King 's House there was a sudden stir , a blare of trumpets , a hurried falling away of crowds before the entrance . Out they came , arms about one another 's waists , no doubt on their way to worship at the House of the Aten . Pharaoh Akhenaten seemed sicklier than when I glimpsed him last , a month ago ; it seemed to me that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chariot dashed past , the crowds instantly resumed their chatter and bustle , we all went swiftly on about our business . Oddly , it was almost as though the two Kings had never passed , so quickly did life resume its pattern and close over them like the Nile over a handful of sand . I returned to Her Majesty much troubled , both by Hatsuret 's warnings and by this new sign that the Good God and the young Pharaoh really have no support at all among the people to sustain them : for I do not really wish them ill , knowing how terribly Her Majesty would be hurt if harm came to her husband . Knowing me so well , she of course perceived my mood and demanded to know what had disturbed me in the city . But I had neither the heart nor the courage to tell her of either thing . I passed it off with some story of seeing a child slip and fall fatally beneath the wheels of a passing donkey cart , but I do not think she believed me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responded with a searching look from the lovely thoughtful eyes and remarked only : " It is a time when many things trouble us . Let us pray to the Atenor you to Amon , if you likethat all will come well for the Two Lands . " " And for you , Majesty , " I said fervently . " Particularly for you , who have endured so much . " " And with yet more to come , I think , " she said in a faraway tone , as U to herself , " . . . with yet more to come . " Since then she has been lost in thought , withdrawn , remote , not participating as she usually does in the games and prattle of her daughters and of Tut and Beketaten . Now as we prepare for the arrival within the  | hour of the Great Wife , Her Majesty 's father Aye , her half brother Horemheb and Amonhotep , Son of Hapu , she remains silent , unresponsive , almost listless under my skilled hands as I assist her once again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes , the ocher for her cheeks , the sweet perfumes , all the familiar beautifications with which I have helped her prepare for appearances so many , many thousands of times . She will rise to this occasion as to all others , of that I am certain ; and I know even more certainly than I did when I spoke with Hatsuret that she will never flinch or flee from the vengeance of Amon , which now seems to be coming very close and surely will not be long delayed . " Fair of Face , Joyous with the Double Plume , Mistress of Happiness , Endowed with Favor , at hearing whose voice one rejoices , Lady of Grace , Great of Love , whose disposition cheers the Lord of the Two Lands . " So did he have me described on the boundary stelae that ring the city and still carry these endearments , undisturbed . Nefertiti , which means " A Beautiful Woman Has Come " so was I named by my mother on her deathbed , in the hour of my birth . And what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , as faithful Anser-Wossett works diligently to hide my sorrow with lotions and ointments , sweet perfume and pretty things ? What of the " Mistress of Happiness " now , when it is another 's voice at which the Lord of the Two Lands rejoices , and another 's disposition that cheers him in his lonely life ? What remains for her who was " Great of Love " when love is denied and sent away to an empty and distant place ? For three years I have lived in the North Palace , nevermore seeing the Lord of the Two Lands save only on those rare occasions when we happen to meet unexpectedly while passing to or from worshiping the Aten . We do not speak , our glances hardly cross . I am afraid I can not keep some lingering entreaty out of mine when they do : in return I receive nothing but a frozen stare . Whether this truly represents his feelings or whether he looks thus to avoid showing more genuine emotion , I do not know and probably will never know . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not look at me naturally for fear of what his eyes would show . But that may be pretending to myself . It may all be as dead as my heart so often feels . Beside him always is my cousin Smenkhkara , performing the weak pretext of government that Akhenaten no longer favors with his attention . But though he is still diligent about his visits to Memphis and Thebes , Smenkhkara is growing a little indolent as he grows more secure in his brother 's affection . He is tending to become increasingly like his father , a lover of luxury , indulging himselfand being indulged in fine food , fine wines , fine jewelry . Another year or two and he will no doubt begin to grow a bit fat , the golden perfection will soften and bloat : give him five years and he will waddle . But I do not expect even that to turn my husband from his obsession , so closely have their lives become entwined . Nor do I expect it to have any effect on my selfish and hateful daughter Merytaten , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were the Chief Wife , or possibly even the Great Wife herself . Nothing suits her better than to have things stay exactly as they are , for she exercises my rights , my privileges , my honors with none of the responsibility and none of the concern for Kemetthat always marked my conduct when I was at her father 's side . She was always ambitious , always grasping , always shrewish , even as a child . Now she has it all , and makes sure that I know it . Possibly this is because I used to punish her from time to time , used to impose a stern and evenhanded discipline upon all the girls but particularly upon her and Ankhesenpaaten , who has many of the same characteristics but has learned under my tutelage to modify them to more subtle and more skillful ways . I do not know : I know only that she is hurtful to me and encourages both her father and her uncle-husband to continue in their foolish and fateful lives . Thereby she invites upon herself the retribution that may fall upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bargain , if that time comes . I suspect that my mother-in-law intends that it come fast , else she would not have called us together in family council tonight . She is looking much aged , tired and worn ; the plump-faced girl who sits smugly beside smug Amonhotep III ( life , health , prosperity ! ) in the colossal Statues that still guard the deserted temple of Amon at Luxor now walks the earth a wrinkled old woman while he lies beneath it a shriveled mummy . But the indomitable character that made the Great Wife Pharaoh in all but name of the Two Lands for so many years remains Indomitable still ; and now I fear that she has decided at last to turn Irrevocably against her sons . I do not know what she contemplates : I do not know yet how I shall  | respond to it . Many things in me cry out for vengeance : many cry equally for forbearance and compassion . Smenkhkara is an amiable fool who may have to be sacrified , but Akhenaten is another matter . His life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so sad . Many and grievous are the crimes he has committed against ma'at , but many and grievous have been the compulsions driving him to it . And he did create out of his own heart and mindthe only Pharaoh in our two thousand years of history who ever dared defy the patternthe decision to raise the Aten to be the Sole and Only God , a beacon to light Kemet 's way from centuries of superstition and darkness toward a new and glorious freedom . . . which Kemet does not want , and which I am afraid the Great Wife , my father and the others have finally decided can never be . But the Aten still lives in my heart , as love still lives there ; which is one of the reasons I approach with such great apprehension our conference tonight and what may flow from it . In my house the Aten lives , as it does in his ; and I am raising the children , particularly Tut and Ankhesenpaaten who may eventually reach the throne , to know the Aten 's truth and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor his principal prophet will be forgotten . Perhaps Amon and the others must be restored someday , but modestlymodestly . I intend to make certain that the Aten never loses the dominant position to which Akhenaten has raised him , for the Aten is bright and shining and good . The old darkness of Amon must never return to dominate the Two Lands with fear as it used to do . This I shall always try to prevent , and I believe Tut and Ankhesenpaaten will help me should they be called , as I am afraid they soon might be , to the Double Crown . It is for this reason that I ordered three years ago , shortly after he put me aside , my own temple to the Aten to be built within the confines of the enormous one he built just east of Karnak soon after he became CoRegent fifteen years ago . This temple I commanded to consist of nothing but glorification of me and our daughters ( in a happy unity we do not , of course , possess ) worshiping the Aten and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act of homage to the Aten , so that it would be understood that I was still loyal to the Sole God no matter what might happen to my husband ; and also as an act of defiance toward my husband , so that he would know that he could not break my spirit or my loyalty to the god , whatever he might do to me . I did not try to have it built here in Akhet-Aten , for he could have prevented me here and probably would have done so . By ordering it built at Karnak I secured the assistance and support of the Great Wife . She confirmed my orders , and he did not dare countermand them . In any event , I doubt that he  | even noticed , or if he did , remained uncaring , because he has never returned to Thebes since the day of his father 's entombment . Perhaps he even pretends to himself that my temple does not exist , since he has never seen it and apparently never intends to . But there it stands within the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Aten and a temple to me , whom he can never destroy for all his unfairness that hurts me so bitterly in my heart . Tonight we have an issue on its face small , by implication and timing great : the depiction of the coronation durbar in the tombs of Huy and Meryra . Those two gentlemen , properly cowed , slink fearfully about their business , caught between the conflicting commands of Pharaoh that the scene be portrayed exactly as it was in all its pathetic sparseness and more than fraternal indignity , and the demands of the Great Wife and myself that the honor of the Dynasty be maintained for all time by depicting it as it should have been : myself and all six girls , alive and well and happy at the side of Akhenaten , receiving the fulsome tributes of our allies and vassals , blessed through eternity in the rays of the Aten . I believe it may be the Great Wife 's intention that we should present our demands ( I doubt if I shall attend that session , but she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ united family ; and that then , if Akhenaten and Smenkhkara refuse to comply , move swiftly to take some action we will have agreed upon here before they are confronted . What action does she have in mind ? It is this that frightens me . I sense an end of patience in the airperhaps even an end of love , as duty to Kemet persuades both the Great Wife and my father that they must put aside personal feelings and move at last to challenge Akhenaten 's unhappy rule . In this I do not know where I shall stand or what I shall do . I may not know until the moment actually comes . I can not conceive of turning against him irrevocably myself ; love ingrained in me since childhood ingrained , ironically , by the very ones who may now wish to put love aside foreverwould seem to make it impossible . Yet I agree with them : the Two Lands can not go on like this . Somehow there must be a slop . Anser-Wossett puts the final touches , for the many-thousandth time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me the mirror . Together , as always , we survey what her handiwork has accomplished with the gifts of the gods I received at birth . My eyes meet hers in the mirror and we exchange smiles : in my own , I am afraid , but a ghost of the delighted satisfaction with which I performed this little ritual in happier limes.  | As our eyes meet , there comes a sudden disturbance in the courtyard , a hurrying down the corridors , the distant sounds of arrival . My eyes widen and , despite my firmest attempts , grow frightened . Instinctively she places a reassuring hand upon my shoulder , a familiarity she has never dared before in all our years together : but these are not usual times . I place my hand upon hers , exert a grateful pressure in return . I hand the mirror to her carefully , rise slowly to my feet , turn with a careful dignity toward the door , take a deep breath and lift my head to its proudest height upon my long , graceful neck . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurriedly at my back . " The gods will not desert you this night . " " I pray not , " I say over my shoulder as I leave the room , " for I need their strengthening now as I never have before . " My daughter-in-law greets us gravely at the entrance to her rooms in the North Palace . No outward sign of nervousness or apprehension touches that perfect face . Yet it is she , I know , whom we must convince before this night is over . I may have to give the word , but without her support the attempt can fail and accomplish nothing but more confusion and uncertainty for the Two Lands . We have had enough of these . I have watched this family many , many times , and never have I seen its principal members so stern and troubled as they are tonight . We come now , I believe , to the beginning of the end of the rule of Nefer-Kheperu-Ra Akhenaten , that strange boy we all regard with such sadness because there was a time when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be sixty-five years of age , Aye and I having marched the  | years together and having , in some degree , together been responsible for the creation of the complex character that has brought such disaster on the Two Lands . I wonder now if we could have done it any differently , produced some different end : I do not think so . I think it all came originally from his illness . I think it was all decreed by the gods . ' ? I think , perhaps , it was decreed by Amon , though I have tried valiantly for fifteen years now to convince myself , as Akhenaten would have us convince ourselves , that Amon is no more and only the kindly Aten shines over all . Perhaps my lack of success in sustaining this conviction is that I know Amon has not left us . He is hiding in a secret corridor off Horemheb 's tomb in Sakkara , awaiting only the proper day to reappear . Now the day approaches , I think . I know in my own heart , as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , that it is almost here . The Great Wife is older , too , beginning to shrivel and wrinkle as the years march on . Her face , ravaged by time and worry for her sons and for the Two Lands , carries only a trace of its girlish beauty and self-satisfaction ; long gone are the days when she and Amonhotep III ( life , health , prosperity ! ) ruled contented over a contented and unthreatened kingdom . Now all that is gone , save for one thing : alone of them all , she still holds the undivided and unshaken love of the people of Kemet . They respect Aye , they admire , and secretly , perhaps , fear a little , Horemheb ; they are deeply fond of Sitamon , they look with anticipation and approval on youthful Tut , they pity and still retain some lingering affection for Nefertiti ; but only Queen Tiye do they still simply and unreservedly adore . To them she represents " the great days , " as they have already come to call them , looking backward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their Queenand their Pharaoh , too , in a profound emotional sense that neither Akhenaten nor his too amiable and slow witted brother can ever match . Therefore if she has finally decided , as I think she has , that the time has come when they must go for the good of Kemet , the people , though momentarily shocked and perhaps even horrified ( though little feeling remains for either Pharaoh ) , will speedily embrace whatever happens if it is felt that she approves it . Particularly is this true if one adds to it the fact that this will be a mother 's terrible judgment on her sons . " If the Great Wife , their mother , feels that way , " the whisper will run , " then who are we to question ? " And no one will . All will unite in unanimous joy that relief has come at last to the Two Lands . Yet it is not an easy thing for this to happen ; it is no light matter . It is tragedy such as Kemet has rarely seen and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a thousand stones as we take our seats in Nefertiti 's throne room facing the Great Wife , who by our instinctive courtesy and deferral occupies the dais . She is dressed in her full golden garments and wears her distinctive delicate and beautifully worked golden crown , set with carnelian , turquoise and lapis lazuli . Aye is frowning and stern , Horemheb is grim and , as always , wary ; Queen Tiye herself is sad , tense but determined . Only Nefertiti , as always , remains outwardly calm and unemotional , though we all know the tensions that must be swirling inside . It is perhaps in hopes of releasing these at once so that Nefertiti can join in what may have to be done that Queen Tiye begins so bluntly . " The time has come , " she says , and though her voice quivers she continues without flinching , " when for the good of the Two Lands Nefer-Kheperu-Ra and Ankh-Kheperu-Ra must be removed from the throne . " There is terrible silence for a moment . Then Aye speaks , a heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he must : " Sister , I agree with you . " We look then to Horemheb , who for a second makes some show of hesitating . Then he bows gravely to the Great Wife and says firmly : " And I , Your Majesty . " They look then to me , wanting to unite all of us before we demand of Nefertiti her compliance and support . And so I too bow and say sim-ply : " It is for the good of the Two Lands . " Then we turn together to the Chief Wife , who has listened in silence , only the widening of her beautiful eyes and the dead white paleness beneath her make-up ( which now looks suddenly garish and obvious , something we have never seen with her before ) disclosing her emotion . But what emotion ? We wait for her to say . A long moment passes . The silence grows more terrible still . At last she speaks , very slowly , very carefully , as if seeking time against a judgment she dreads but can not contradict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she inquires finally ; and with a sudden impatience , not unkind but not yielding either , Queen Tiye says : " Niece , you know as well as I. " Again the terrible silence , and again the very slow , very careful response , while we all stare fascinated , not wishing to watch her bitter struggle but unable to keep our eyes away . " What will be Your Majesty 's excuse ? "  | " The excuse of the paintings in the tombs , Niece , " the Great Wife says . " You know that , too . " " He will be given a chance to agree about the paintings ? " Nefertiti inquires , and we can see she is clinging to some last hope , inspired by a lifelong love . " He will be given the chance , " Queen Tiye says grimly , " but you know as well as we what his answer will be . " " Perhaps not , " Nefertiti says with a sudden beseeching eagerness that we all know springs from hope , not reality . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then there will be more misrule , " Horemheb says with a sudden bitterness . She turns on him like a lioness . " You relish this ! You wish him dead ! You hate him as you always have ! " For a moment he does not reply . Then he looks her squarely in the eyes and replies softly : " Do I , Little Sister ' ? Does Big Brother ' hate Little Brother ' ? It was not so when we were playing together in the happy days at Malkata . " " The happy days at Malkata , ' " she repeats , very low . " ' The happy days at Malkata ! ' I wish the gods had never let us leave Malkata ! " " They did not take us from Malkata , " Aye remarks quietly . " He did . There was nothing but sand where we sit tonight before he brought us here . That you know also , Daughter . " " But he will be given the chance , " she repeats , not replying to her father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And if he says no , as you all expect " " And you expect , " Aye says gently , but again she ignores him . " then what will become of him ? " she concludes . And suddenly , frightening us all , her voice rises almost to a shriek . " What will happen to my husband ? " " We shall try , " Queen Tiye replies , and her voice again trembles but she does not flinch from the import of her words , " not to hurt him . We shall try not to hurt either of them . But if they continue as they are and we have all decided , Niece , that this is the final testthen they must go . There is no other way . " " You will not strike down Pharaoh ! " she cries . " You dare not strike down Pharaoh ! The people would never allow it ! " " No , " Aye agrees , " they would notnot even this Pharaoh , with all his sad misruleif they knew in time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's troops surround your palace . They have orders to let no one go out who is not approved by the Great Wife or by me . No one will arouse the people . "  | Again there is a silence as she stares at him with unbelieving eyes , the lovely face no longer serene but shadowed with a terrible fear and dismay . " I am a prisoner , then , " she says in a broken , pathetic voice . " I am a prisoner , then , and can not even go to him . " " You are a prisoner for a little time only , " Horemheb says ; and adds , his tone more gentle than his words , " And besides , Sister : what makes you think he would want you to go to him ? " To this she replies with a sudden sharp , strangled cry , wordless but filled with painbecause it is true , and she knows it as well as we . She begins to weep , a racking , painful , awful sound ; and on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But her expression does not yield , and presently Nefertiti rises and half walksfinally half crawls to the foot of the dais . There she raises her hands in supplication . " Can it not be done , " she asks between her sobs , " can it not be done inin such a waythat it will notnothurt him ? Can he not be given a warning ? Can there not be one more chance ? " " What warning ? " Horemheb asks sharply . " What chance ? He deserves nothing from the Two Lands , or from us who are their guard-ians ! " " The gods did not make you their guardians ! " she cries with a sudden savage bitterness , turning on him through her tears . " He is their guardian ! He alone ! " " And Smenkhkara , " Horemheb answers softly . " Do not ever forget Smenkhkara . " Instantly her expression changes : inspiration flashes across the now ravaged face with its make-up striggling , its hair at last disheveled , disturbed as we have never seen it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hands in supplication . I think all of us know instinctively what is coming now . Her voice is suddenly cold , clear and steady . " Smenkhkara ! " she says , with a softness as still and serpentine as Horemheb 's own . " Smenkhkara ! Would not that be warning enough , Majesty ? Would not that bring him to his senses ? " For several moments no one speaks . We are figures frozen in a frieze , captured in our moment of revelation , devastated and enthralled as she is by the prospect sheand Horemheb ( perhaps inadvertentlywho ever knows , with Horemheb ? ) have opened before us . At last , because no one else seems able , I clear my throat and venture to break the silence . " It would save a direct attack upon Pharaoh , " I say cautiously . Aye agrees , face grim . " It would have that advantage . "  | " I do not think it will succeed , " Horemheb says at last . " But if the Great Wife agrees , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Queen Tiye . Her tears have stopped , she is staring far away into some distance placeMalkata , I think , in the old days , with little boys running and laughing through the corridors . Almost she does not breathe , so intensely and so tragically is she thinking . Almost do we not breathe either , waiting upon her word . The silence lengthens .. . lengthens . . . until at last she utters a great sigh and returns to us . " Let us see what they say a half hour from now , " she says , her voice firm , a decision of some kind obviously reached . " Then we will know better what to do . " " You do agree with me ! " Nefertiti cries with a rising excitement . " You will try what I suggest ! Oh , Majesty , Majesty ! Tell me you will do as I suggest ! " Queen Tiye stares down upon her still prostrate figure with a look both wondering and compassionate . Gently she rises , steps forward , reaches down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wife 's sweat-drenched forehead . " Do not worry , Niece , " she says gently . " I shall try to be fair to all . Though the gods help me " and suddenly she gives us a wild look , almost as though we were not there , swept away again into the world of our terrible decisions , twice as terrible for her , their mother " though the gods help me , I do not know how ! " " Good ! " Nefertiti cries , leaping to her feet like a girl , wildly excited and happy , while the old Queen gropes blindly for her brother 's arm and with his help blindly descends from the throne . " Oh , thank you , Majesty , thank you ! " And she rushes to the door , flings it open , forgettingprobably for the first time in her entire lifehow she will appear to the servants and claps her hands furiously . From all sides they come running . Two minutes later we are in the chariots on our way across the still busy nighttime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shopkeepers haggle over bread and meat and vegetables , past the shrilly whistling hawkers of candy and fine linens , the donkey carts pushing through with their loads of straw , the casually strolling soldiers , hand in hand , who know nothing of the terrible drama our hurried passage represents as we race by , scattering them momentarily before they close placidly behind uson our way to the South Palace to see the two Kings .  | Behind us in the doorway Nefertiti stands watching , a strange mixture of triumph , terror and sorrow on her face . Tears are once more running unheeded down her cheeks . In the savage light of the torches she looks like an avenging goddess ecstatic , but shaken to the heart in her moment of victory . She is still a very beautiful woman . " Brother , " he says nervously , standing close by the window in the South Palace , peering to the north across the low jumbled roofs of the city , " I see a little group of torches moving this way . They come quickly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come our way . " " So ? " I inquire dryly , for you and I have learned , Father Aten , that this is the way to calm this simple child who is Co-Regent , King and Pharaoh of the Two Lands as I am , yet at many moments is still just my worried and uncertain little brother in need of my comforting . " So ? Are the Lords of the Two Lands to tremble like women thereby ? " " I do not tremble like a woman ! " he says , half indignant but turning to smile at me . " It is just " his expression changes abruptly again to one of nervousness and concern " that I do not like the thought of having to do battle with our mother . " " There will be no battle , " I say , raising myself awkwardly from my throne , hobbling carefully down the steps of the dais , shuffling over to stand beside him , my arm reassuringly around his waist . " She is the Great Wife , " he says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And I am Nefer-Kheperu-Ra Akhenaten , King of the North and South , Living Horus , Son of the Sun , Great Bull , King and Pharaoh of the Two Lands , He Who Has Lived Long , Living in Truthand all the rest of it , " I say , trying to josh him from his mood . " And not even the Great Wife , I warrant you , will dare to attack me . " " But I am not these things , " he says with a little shiver I can feel run through his body . " I was not born so , I am not so , save by your grace . " " Or if I should die , " I say , still lightly . " Then you would be all this by full right , for it is all yours by blood as next in line , should I no longer be here . "  | He gives me a long , searching , sidelong glance , his face completely serious , determined , young . " I will never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And I , " I respond , my voice croaking suddenly with emotion , " will never let anyone harm you , either . " Suddenly we kiss , not lingeringly and lovingly as we often do , but with a terrible desperation . Yet why should we both be afraid , Father Aten ? We are under your protection , and all we do is guarded by love . Below the guards come jangling to attention . Horses ' hoofs ring on pavement , the sweating animals snort and puff . Bustle fills the corridors , shouts and sounds of arrival echo through the South Palace . Reluctantly we release one another and he assists me back to the dais . Leaning heavily on his strong right arm , yet still having to drag myself painfully and by sheer force of will , as I must increasingly do in these recent months when my body seems to weary along with my mind , I remount the throne . " Her Majesty the Great Wife , the Divine Father-in-law and Councilor Aye , the General Horemheb , the Sage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the King 's Own Room shouts from beyond the door . " In a moment ! " I call back sharply . " When the Good God is ready ! " Quickly Smenkhkara hands me the crook and flail , adjusts the pleated kilt over my knees , settles the golden headdress more gracefully about my shoulders , adjusts the towering blue linen Double Crown more firmly on my head , makes sure the uplifted cobra head of the uraeus is centered exactly above my forehead . Then he quickly adjusts his own regalia , exactly similar to mine , and takes his seat on the throne at my right hand . Then , and only then , when all is ready , do I raise my voice and , aided by your loving strength , 0 Aten , and his , call out in a strong and commanding voice that miraculously does not fail me but sounds strong and steady : " Bid those enter who wish audience with the Kings of the Two Lands ! "  | They greet us like two golden statues , seated on their double @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we think , all we plan , it is impossible not to be awed by the ancient mystery . Aye , Horemheb and I fall to our knees , touch our foreheads to the floor in ritual greeting . Only the Great Wife remains standing , rigid and unyielding in her golden garments , crowned head high , eyes staring fearlessly into theirs . " You have not provided chairs for us , my sons , " she says in a clear , level voice . " I did not rear you to show such discourtesy to those to whom courtesy is due . " She pauses expectantly while Aye , Horemheb and I rise . No expression crosses Akhenaten 's face , and after a lightning sidewise glance to see what he should do , Smenkhkara sets his face in the same unyielding pattern . The silence lengthens , begins to turn awkward . Anger , for her and for us , begins to fill our hearts . Once again Nefer-Kheperu-Ra has misjudged the world in which he lives . " You wished to see me about something ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second we can sense her debating whether to force the issue , order Aye to call up servants with chairswhich I do not think even Pharaoh , lost as he is in dreams of the Aten and arrogance , would dare countermand . We can also sense Smenkhkara 's instinctive protest at this brutal treatment of their mother , even as we sense his immediate helpless resignation as he realizes he can not defy his brother . Then we sense her decision : No , let him act like this , if he is fool enough . It will only strengthen our resolve . " Very well , " she says , and with serene grace turns gravely and beckons us forward . Not looking at the two Kings , we advance , Aye at her right hand , Horemheb and I respectfully a half step behind , he on the right beside his father , I on the Great Wife 's left . " Are you comfortable now ? " Akhenaten asks with a biting sarcasm ; and serenely she replies , " Yes , my son , and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night . " " What is it you wish to discuss ? " he asks ; and as she did with Nefertiti , Queen Tiye decides to be blunt . Her resolve , we realize , goes even deeper than we imagined .  | " Your shameful order to Huy and Meryra that their tombs should depict the durbar solely with your brother and yourself , instead of in the traditional way with the Chief Wife , your daughters and the tribute of the Nine Bows and all our vassals and allies , as befits the dignity and honor of this House , " she says calmly , biting off the concluding phrase with an emphasis that shows she does not desire to take any nonsense . Neither , of course , does he . " Mother ! " he says sharply , hunching forward awkwardly on his throne and glaring at her from his slanting , wide-set eyes . " Madam ! The dignity and honor of the truth are more important than the dignity and honor of this House . And do you not forget that this is what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I believe . " " Then you are a fool , " she says coolly , and instinctively we gasp , for no one has dared talk to a Pharaoh like this before , not even a mother . But the Great Wife has made up her mind at last , and there is no mistaking , of course , where his iron comes from . She gave it to him : it is only natural that she should get it back . Which she does . " Not as great a fool as those who would deny the truth ! " he says with a sharpness equal to hers . " In which category , Madam , I find you now . I have given my order to Huy and Meryra that the durbar shall be pictured as it was , Ankh-Kheperu-Ra at my side , the few paltry tributes we had " " And whose fault is that ? " she interrupts angrily . " Who has let the Empire dwindle to nothing ? Who has been so lost in his games with the Atenand with his brother " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his voice beginning to get its emotion-filled croak . " Mother , be careful ! " " So lost with these things that he has paid no attention to keeping Kemet strong , he has let all slide , he has abandoned all , he has been no Pharaoh but a play-King doing futile things for empty and futile purposes ! " she shouts above his bitter protest , and then , womanlike , begins to cry . But there is no question of this being weakness . They are tears of anger , and she dashes them angrily from her eyes as she hurries on , permitting him no chance to reply . " You have let the Two Lands fall into chaos and corruption ! You have made a mockery of government ! You have made of Kemet , and of yourself and your poor brother , a laughingstock to the world ! You have lowered this House and this Dynasty to the ground ! You have debased not only yourself but all of us with your foolish Aten and your wild crazy doings ! And it must stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cry , continuing to dash away the tears with a furious , impatient anger . Only her heavy breath-  | ing and his fill the room : the rest of us , including poor Smenkhkara , who now looks scared to death and even younger than his twenty brief years , scarcely dare breathe at all . It is obvious that he is going through an intense inner struggle . Tentatively at last his brother reaches out and grasps his arm , with something of the same soothing gesture we used so often to see Nefertiti employ with his rages in his younger days . But he is much older , the rages go deeper and last longer : it will take more than Smenkhkara 's frightened little gesture to calm him now . " Majesty , " he says at last , words barely distinguishable in the harsh croak of his terrible emotion , " I think you had better go and take your fellow traitors with you . I shall not punish you as you deserve , for you are my mother , and all of you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word as he appears to be swept by a sudden gust of feelingcan it be regret and sadness , can those actually be tears in the eyes of our strange , strange Nefer-Kheperu-Ra ? " Since all of you aremymy family . But I do not want you come near me again , or try to communicate with me in any way , or defile and defame Father Aten , or Ankh-Kheperu-Ra , or me , ever , ever , ever again . Go ! Go ! Go ! " Again there is silence while he stares at us like some wounded animal cornered and filled with bitterness and hate . We are stunned , we do not move . He is pale and quivering with the emotion and effort of it all , looking suddenly as though Anubis , guardian of the grave , were touching him urgently on the shoulder and might not long delay calling him to the West . At his side his brother looks equally stricken , but in a way typical of poor Smenkhkara , who must now pay the penalty we have decided upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mother , whom he loves , for his brother , whom he loves , and for us , whom he loves . His concern is all with others , not with himself . How sad that such a goodhearted lad must die for no other crime , really , than simply being too goodhearted . But this will come a little later , in some way no doubt already planned by Aye and Horemheb . For the moment they must make one last attempt to bring the Good God back to reason , before they can finally feel themselves free to proceed as they must . " Does Your Majesty mean to strip me of all my powers and duties as Councilor ? " Aye inquires at last in a low and trembling voice . " I have told you , " Akhenaten replies , obviously with a great effort but unrelenting : " Go ! " And so , after a few further seconds of uncertainty , Queen Tiye , still weeping , gestures us toward the door . Aye is weeping , Horemheb  | ( quite genuinely , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weep for them all , for tragedies past and tragedies yet to come . At the door I can not resist a quick glance backward . There on their thrones , holding one another in a desperate grasp whose terrible desolation communicates itself to me like a blow , the two mighty Kings of the Two Lands are weeping too . How strange and terrible can families be , whose members sometimes do such awful things to one another . We go to the beautiful little palace of the Great Wife on the bank of the Nile , there to set in motion the fate the gods have decreed for him who thought he could destroy the gods . I do not know what happened when they all met last night , because Smenkhkara will not tell me . All I know is that this morning he is moping about , bursting into sudden tears , uttering unintelligible sounds , acting like a sickly girl , which I often think he is . I have never understood my father 's infatuation for him : to me he has always seemed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have suffered him as husband because that is what the needs of the Dynasty require , but I am glad to say I have never let him touch meeven had he wanted to , which he has not . I have suffered him also because it is not only the needs of the Dynasty that concern me . If my father dies , as his poor health and uncaring ways with foodI doubt if he eats enough now to keep a bird alive may soon guarantee , then my puling child of an uncle-husband will become the only King , supreme in power and authority , omnipotent Pharaoh of the Two Lands . No one will dare challenge him , no one will dare control him , no one will rule the rulersave one . I will . And presently , when he has served my purposes sufficiently when with his spineless agreement I have removed my mother and my grandmother forever from any power in Kemetmaybe even removed them from life itself , if the gods do not soon do the task for methen I shall consider what to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kemet will have another Hatshepsut ( life , health , prosperity ! ) to rule and strengthen the Two lands anew .  | I can do it . I have the strength . I have the courage . I am capable of it all . They tend to dismiss me as a domineering , unpleasant , interfering girl , but they do so at their peril . None of them will be safe from the Pharaoh Merytaten ( life , health , prosperity to me ! ) when the time comes for me to strike ... . Thus do I dream , particularly on days like today when my pathetic stick of a husband shows himself in all his pretty weakness . I despise him . I despise them all . Maybe what I dream is nonsense but I do not think so . Everybody around me is weak except my mother and my grandmother , Aye and Horemheb . What nature does not dispose of , I can , if I plan carefully enough . And I will . I have little else to do but think about it all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They will see . Now I think I hear him coming : there is a sniffling in the hall . Yes , here he comes , still wiping his eyes with the back of a hand . But he has stopped crying , I think . In fact , he looks quite excited and , surprisingly , of a sudden quite happy . He is not alone . Peneptah , the bearded new scribe who has entered my father 's house , is with him . I have noticed Peneptah for some time . He appeals to me . He too , I think , is very strong . He is also very manly and exciting in that way , too . Hatshepsut ( life , health , prosperity ! ) had her Senemut as builder , councilor , lover and strong right arm to smite her enemies . Why should not Merytaten ( life , health , prosperity to me ! ) have her Peneptah ? But now the weakling speaks . " The Great Wife has sent me a beautiful scarab by this messenger ! " he says excitedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a proof of her love ! She does not hate us after all ! " " I did not know she hated you , " I say coldly , though I can not resist a quick , secret , amused little glance at Peneptah , who returns it with equal humor , and as furtively . " You were not there last night , " Smenkhkara says , and for a moment looks as though he might burst into tears again . But he is too excited by this bauble from his mother , which to me means nothing but to him , in the context of their apparent quarrel , seems to mean everything . " So she has sent you a scarab , " I say , letting my voice become mocking . Peneptah again gives me a secret little smile behind my uncle 's back . " Yes , here it is ! " he says , still sounding like an excited child , and opening his hand , reveals it to me . It is indeed a beauty , large and finely carved , made of carnelian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must confess it appeals to me simply for itself . It must come from her private collection , and be very old . Perhaps it was even worn by Hatshepsut ( life , health , prosperity ! ) Suddenly I am sure of it .  | " Can I have it ? " I ask bluntly while Peneptah smiles benignly in the background and encourages me with little winks and nods . " Well " Smenkhkara hesitates , and then says doubtfully , " It should be washed , I think . It gives off an odor of some sort . It stains my hands . " He holds them out to me , and indeed there is a whitish dust upon them . " It must be simply age , " I say impatiently . " I can not smell anything . Here , give it to me ! " And obediently , of course , he does , for anyone who speaks strongly to Smenkhkara can usually carry the day . I take the scarab in my hands , rub it between them . The same powdery stain comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nose , take a deep breath . There is indeed , though I will not give him the satisfaction of saying so , a faint peculiar odor . Seeing me give no sign , he follows my example and sniffs his hands deeply . Behind his back Peneptah continues to smile and nod encouragement . I must see that he returns when Smenkhkara goes to my father later in the day . " It is nothing but dust , " I say scornfully . " I suppose you are right , " he agrees less doubtfully . " It must be very old . I do not think she would send a proof of her love to me that was just new-made . It can only be veryvery " And quite amazingly he stops in mid-sentence , gives a deep gasp for breath , clutches his throat , utters a strangled and incoherent cry and falls writhing at my feet . Instinctively I start to lean down to him , when suddenly he goes limp . I start to scream , but am dimly aware that Peneptah has leaped forward and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , can not breathe . He removes his hand , I struggle , I start to fall . Gently he lowers me to the floor beside Smenkhkara . Again I try to scream , I can not , there is no air , I can not breatheI can not breathemy body is twisting , turning I can not breathe ! Dimly through my terrible thrashings I see that Peneptah has stepped forward , carefully scooped up the scarab in a heavy cloth drawn from the folds of his garment , and stepped back . lie begins to fade from my glazing eyes . He is in the doorway , looking thoughtfully and patiently down upon us . He is still smiling .  | Criers are shouting something in the city . There is a frightened silence out there everywhere . When I look out of the windows I see hardly any moving in the streets but there is much running and whispering in the North Palace . My cousin Nefertiti is crying hysterically as though she has seen terrible things . They say my brother Smenkhkara and my cousin Merytaten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now I come next to my brother Akhenaten in line for the throne . I do not want to be Pharaoh . It means terrible things . I am frightened . I do not want to be Pharaoh ... . Ah !

Help me !  | He never stirs from the Great House now : neither my father nor I see him once in a month , probably . Yet the governing of Kemet somehow goes on because it has to go on . It goes on because we make it go on .. . and because there is no one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had to die , and I feel no regret for that : he was the willing fool of his brother , and deserved it ) , the heart seemed to die as well in Akhenaten . This of course was what we intended . For seventy days he did nothing but hover , weeping , over the embalmment and burial ; I think even the precious Aten was forgotten during that time . He acted as one paralyzed , lost in grief , uncaring what went on anywhere around him , saving only that the tomb , the mummy and the coffinthose affronts to the gods and common decency ! must be exactly as he wanted them . Therefore , of course , neither my father Aye nor myself was stripped of any honors or powers . We simply went right ahead , aided by my younger half brother Nakht-Min , whom we persuaded Akhenaten to appoint Vizier , doing what had to be done for the Two Lands , exercising our authority unchanged , giving our commands as though he had never removed us from office . Besides ourselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ died the next morning , and the loyalty and support of the Great Wife and Amonhotep , Son of Hapu , have never wavered . No one will ever know that Nefer-Kheperu-Ra cried " Go ! " to us in that frenzied , frantic , childish way , and banished us forever from power . And he is too disheartened and broken now ever to try it again . This we have proved by putting it to the test . The first step , of course , was to order immediately that the coronation durbar be depicted in the tombs of Huya and Meryra exactly as the Great Wife and Nefertiti wished . Now in both tombs the scene is as it should be for all time : serene on their thrones , Akhenaten and Nefertiti , surrounded by their daughters , receive the Parade of Tribute from our dutiful allies and vassals . Around them are happy games and celebrations of his assumption of power . It does not matter that this is not the truth .  | Give it a few years and it will be . When he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by grief to countermand uswe were very careful , mind you , to go to him and announce what we had done ; he merely gave a long shuddering sigh and stared at us from those red-rimmed , unseeing eyes until we shivered , in something approaching fright , and went awaywe felt that we had destroyed his will as we had intended , and that he would never recover sufficient strength to defy us . We knew that we could begin to proceedstill very cautiously and slowly , for he is still Pharaoh , of course , and there still might be some last flare of rage and defiance , though we think it very unlikelyto prepare for the end of his rule , the enthronement of Tut and the return of Amon . " The end of his rule " : this we have yet to accomplish , and the means are not yet fully clear . We have broken his will and with it we have apparently broken his body , for we understand from Hatsuret , who still remains on regular duty in the Palace , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Aten and to his dead brother , grows steadily thinner and weaker , and seems , in fact , to be fading away physically as well as mentally . He lives almost in a daze , Hatsuret says ( fingering with satisfaction the beautiful carnelian and lapis scarab , long since cleansed of its impurities , which he hangs about his neck on a gold chain and loves to fondle as he talks ) , and his end can not be too long delayed . But how long is " too long , " and how much longer can we afford to let Kemet suffer the indignities that everywhere beset her ? My father and I , aided by clever Tutu the Foreign Minister , now handle Pharaoh 's correspondence with our allies and vassalsand a sorry correspondence it is . They used to beg for gold : now they beg for salvation . The Hittites , pushed back and held firmly in place by Tuthmose III and Amonhotep II ( life , health , prosperity to them both , great builders and savers of the Two Lands ! ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the leadership of their new King , Supp-i-lu-li-u-mas , into Mittani , Syria , Byblos and beyond . With them conspires Aziru of Amurru , playing a double game which is obvious to Aye and myself , though even now I do not quite dare send out armies on my own command : I am still paralyzed by the simple fact of Pharaoh . It is Pharaoh they want . They want the Living Horus at the head of his troops to save them , and they are right : nothing else can do it now . Things have reached such a pass of demoralization in our northern territories that only his actual presence could produce the necessary magic : and he is in no condition at all to go . We do not feel guilty about this , nor do we take responsibility for it , since even when he had the strength he had no inclination . The Empire  | has been crumbling for a decade and he has done nothing about it even when he could . He would never have changed even had we left him in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as in so many others . He has had himself depicted in the friezes and statues smiting the enemies of Kemet like any other Pharaoh , but in his heart he has not had the will or the energy to lift a finger . It is only one in the long catalogue of his sins . So the letters come in . They still address him as " the King , my Lord , my Sun , my God . " They still say , " I am thy servant , the dust of thy feet . . . . " They still tell him , " I look to the King my lord , and there is light . . . . I move not away from the King 's feet . . . . On my neck rests the yoke of my lord the King . . . . " They prate , " At the feet of the King my Lord seven times and again seven times I prostrate myself upon my back and upon any breast . " And they beg for help , poor dogs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this land lies upon the heart of my Lord , let my Lord send troops , and let him come . .. . " Lord of the Two Lands , King of Kings , God-King on earth : lead your army to us in your own divine person , at the head of your vast army , with glittering chariots of gold , with warriors heavy with weapons as far as eye can see ! " .. . And from Simyra and Tunip two months ago : " Bring help , before it is too late ! " And from Tunip two weeks ago : " Now we belong no more to our Lord the King of Kemet . . . when Aziru enters Simyra , Aziru will do with us as he pleases , in the territory of our Lord , the King . . . . " And from Tunip yesterday : " And now Tunip , thy city , weeps , and her tears are flowing , and there is no help for us . " And here we sit paralyzed , while all falls ! We do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . What would be the use ? He would do nothing anyway . All falls , all falls ! The Two Lands dwindle and the Hittites advance . Would I were Pharaoh now , to rid us of this shame before it is too late to rebuild the Empire and make Kemet great again ! It is late , it is late ! All falls . . . . My father counsels patience . He shrinks , I think , from further death , as does the Great Wife . From time to time Nefertiti still tries , in vain , to see her husband . Fortunately he always refuses , so we do not have to interpose force to keep her from him . If she were to see him she might be able to rally him for one last attempt to reassert his power . She is the  | only one who could . But he does not know this : he deliberately keeps her away . Poor Akhenaten , who has always cut himself off from everyone and everything that could help him ! I might weep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wept for him , in days past . But he receives no tears from me any more . It is all too late for that . Almost a year has passed since the death of Ankh-Kheperu-Ra . Still he grieves , shut away in the Great House . When my father and I visit , the windows are shuttered , incense burns , priests of the Aten , by his order , still chant dirges in the corridors : all is dark and gloomy . He has stopped wearing his regalia to greet us . Now he wears only a shabby old linen shift like a woman 's , not even the pleated kilt of Pharaoh . He rarely bothers with a wig , his head looks dirty and scrofulous . His misshapen body is thinner , more elongated , more grotesque , if possible . I do not think he lets them bathe him very often . He is turning a little more each day into an old man , though he is barely thirty-two . Only the terrible eyes , haunted , unhappy , filled with pain , stare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He curls upon his throne like an animal , wounded , resentful , dreadfully bereft . We never dare stay long . Conscience does not permit it : and it is all we can do to stand the sight and smell of him , even for a few moments ... . I wonder if we did the right thing ? My concern now is how best and quickest to finish the business : because if the gods did not mean for us to begin it , they should not have let us . And if they will not soon finish it for us , then we must do it ourselves . Ramesses and Hatsuret have their orders to report to me instantly anything that will serve as excuse . Then I shall immediately confront the Great Wife and my father , and whether I receive their approval or not , it will be done . I am determined that it shall not continue like this . I hear some gossip among the soldiers that Nefertiti has selected twelve from among her small contingent of household troops and had them assigned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I wonder ? No one is attacking her .  | Anser-Wossett has sought an audience with Pharaoh . To everyone 's amazement , he has agreed to receive her . They have already been closeted alone for almost an hour . Soldiers are posted at the door . They are Nefertiti 's and will tell me nothing . I loiter close as long as I dare , but say nothing . They begin to give me strange looks . I drop back into the crowd . Why would Anser-Wossett seek audience ? Why would he receive her ? When she departs I am waiting near the steps . Our eyes meet , I nod toward the market-place . She gives the slightest of nods in return . I think she will meet me . Something brews . I must find out what it is . The Heretic must not be allowed to escape the vengeance of Amon . I approach the South Palace , trembling , on the orders of the Queen . I send in my name with the humble request that he grant me audience . Hatsuret lurks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direction . I fully expect to be ordered sternly away , if not worse . When the messenger returns with word that the Good God will see me , I am amazed . I glance then at Hatsuret . He is as amazed as I , everyone is amazed . But I keep my face composed and impassive as the Queen does , and walk past them all down the long corridors to his room . Incense is burning , priests of the Aten chant soft dirges for Smenkhkara . I am announced , the doors are flung open . I sink to my knees without looking up , bend low to touch my forehead to the floor . Behind me the doors close . I look up and can not suppress an involuntary start of dismay : he looks so awful . Of course he sees it , he has always seen everything . A bitter and sarcastic smile touches his face .  | " The Lady Anser-Wossett may rise , " he says , " before she falls over from astonishment at my sad appearance . " " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only " " I know , " he says in a more kindly tone , something of the graciousness he always used to show me in the old days returning . " Here , take this seat beside me , and we will talk . " " But , Your Majesty , " I stammer again , overcome with awe and hesitation , " the seat beside you isis " " It is an empty throne , " he says bleakly . " I know . Please be seated and tell me why you come . " Still hesitantly , for what he invites me to do is really sacrilege , I slowly mount the steps to the dais and seat myself , trembling inwardly with fright at the enormity of my presumption even though he has invited it . " Do n't sit on the edge , " he commands with a trace of amusement . " Sit back and be comfortable . . . . Now " when I have obeyed , very gingerly " how do you find me ? " He is dressed in a simple but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kilt of Pharaoh . He has put on a wig , which is clean . He looks much thinner and older than when I saw him last , really quite emaciated . There are circles under those eyes that always seem to penetrate to the very limit of one 's innermost pretensions . I do not think he has bathed this day , or perhaps for several : a rank odor afflicts my nostrils . But I tell myself firmly that he is the Good God , the Living Horus , King and Pharaoh of the Two Lands , and I must do nothing that will destroy this intimacy which is greater than the Chief Wife and I had ever dared hope . So I give no signat least I think I give no sign . But again , with the heightened sensitivity to others ' reactions to his person that he has had ever since his illness so many years ago , he knows . " Yes , " he says with a sad smile , " I am afraid I am not as cleanly as I used to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But there is nothing now " and again his face takes on that terrible bleak look " there is nothing for which to keep myself in order . . . so more and more I find that I am letting myself become slovenly . Which I know I ought not to do , but " he utters a heavy sigh " somehow , I do not seem to care ... . Here " he reaches for a bottle of scented water that stands on a small table beside his throne " let us scatter this about and see if it will make our talk more pleasant . . . . If you had given me advance warning you were coming , " he goes on when he has finished and I am breathing more easily , " I should have made myself completely presentable for you . But then you might have been afraid to talk honestly to the god .  | Now you can talk to one who , as you see , is but an unclean man , tired and ill and not , I think , too long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no , Your Majesty ! " I protest . " Many , many years await you . Many good things still lie ahead , once thisthis present time has passed . " " Once this present horror has passed ? " he echoes with a smile so infinitely sad that it seems to turn my heart inside out for him . " Oh no , Anser-Wossett : it is not going to pass . It is going to stay with me until I die . Which , as I say , will not be long , I think . And do you know something ? " He swings himself to face me fully , bracing himself with an arm against the arm of his throne . " I do not care . I simply do not care . I pray only to Father Aten that he may take me quickly , so that I may leave this ungrateful people who do not understand or appreciate me and go to rejoin the one who does . " " Your Majesty , " I venture then , a terrible fear and trembling returning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his reaction will be : but the Queen has told me that if I am brave he will respect it and I will receive no harm . " Your Majesty , there is still one who understands and appreciates you , here on this earth . Why can you not , even now , return to her who still loves you ? " For several moments he is silent , sitting frozen as he is . I glanced away when I spoke , not daring to meet his eyes , and so I , too , sit frozen . I expect one of the sudden rages with which Her Majesty and I were once so familiar : such a rage as killed his uncle Aanen , for instance , or Amon 's old High Priest Maya . May it not now kill AnserWossett ? But when he finally speaks it is not in rage but a genuine puzzlement . " Why did she send you to me ? " he asks . " We have had no reason to speak to one another for three years . There is no reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not understand that ? " " No , Your Majesty , " I say , emboldened by his evident willingness to remain calm , " she does not understand that because she still loves you . " " What cause have I given her to do that ? " he asks bluntly , and this time I do turn to him and face him as squarely as he faces me . " No cause whatever , Your Majesty , " I say , as bluntly as he . " In fact , much cause to the contrary . But we women are like that : it is the only explanation . She has been committed to you from a child . She , at least , remains true . . . . " And then , because he still does not rage but continues to look at me curiously from those strange , hooded eyes we will never get used to , I venture still further . " Is there nothing in you that remains true to her , Your Majesty ? "  | " Why did she send you here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was not to tell me of old love , surely . " " No , " I say very quietly . " It was to offer you a plan to escape . " " Escape ? " he asks blankly . " Are you telling me , then , that the Living Horus is a prisoner ? " " You would not be if you would still go about among the people , " I say . " But Your Majesty stays always here , always secluded , always alone . " " I am alone ! " he says sharply . " They take advantage of it , " I say , wondering at my own courage but feeling now that I have gone too far to stop . " Who ? " " Many . " " Name them ! " " They are as numerous as the sands , Your Majesty , " I say , trembling again inside for fear my evasion will provoke his wrath , but determined not to be diverted from the Chief Wife 's purpose . " They are in your house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Naharin , they are south in wretched Kush , they are everywhere along your borders everywhere . And as long as you remain here in the South Palace and do not break out , as long as you do not take the government back in your own hands " " Are you saying my uncle Aye and cousin Horemheb are betraying me ? " he interrupts sharply . " I say they are ruling Kemet because Your Majesty will not , " I retort , and truly then I do not expect to live , for at last his face clouds and a furious expression comes into his eyes . " You go too far , Lady , " he says , his voice suddenly choked with emotion . " I humbly beg Your Majesty 's pardon , " I say , and lower my head and draw my veil across my eyes , which I close in both fright and resignation , for I fully expect the next step to be calling of the guards , followed by prison or death for me . Instead , nothing happens . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am sharply aware that the effect of the perfumed water is wearing off and the odor is returning ; I am aware that I am but a humble subject daring to speak to the Good God as only the Family , I am sure , has ever spoken to him . I am aware that I am sitting , incongruously , on the throne of Kemet , a thought that almost makes me burst into hysterical laughter . I am aware of many things , but the principal one I am aware of is that he is not going to kill me , or even let his rage continue much longer .  | " You speak treasonous things , " he says at last , quietly , " but no doubt you believe you have good cause . Exactly what is the reason my wife sent you here ? " At this I am greatly encouraged , for I believe it has been a very long time since he has acknowledged the fact that Her Majesty is still his wife . " She has prepared your escape , " I repeat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , " he says , half mocking , " where does Pharaoh escape ' to ? " " Twelve of her household troops are trained and ready , " I say . " Prepare yourself . They will come tonight at midnight while all the Palace is asleep . Her Majesty will come with them . She will announce to the guards that she is coming to see you . You , meanwhile , will have told your guards that you expect her , very late , and that she is to be admitted . They will not dare challenge her if you have given the order . She will remain but a very brief while . You will then see her to the outer door , accompanied by her soldiers . Hidden around the corner in the next street will be a litter for you . You will proceed together , not in haste but without slowness either , to the litter . No one will dare challenge you . You will go to the North Palace , take up residence and tomorrow a new day will begin for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Appearances to announce to Kemet that you are reunited and that henceforth you are resuming active control of all Your Majesty 's affairs , removing Aye and Horemheb from their offices and appointing others loyal to you . " I pause , a little out of breath from this lengthy recital . I can see that he is , for the moment at least , interested and perhaps even excited : his face shows more animation than I have seen it show since the death of Smenkhkara . For a moment this lingers , I can see him thinking about it almost as though he believed it possible . Then as abruptly as his face has begun to glow with life , the glow fades . He seems to shrink , to withdraw , to hide away into himself again ; he actually seems to grow smaller and more wasted even as I watch . It is a very odd sensation I have , and it tells me before he speaks that we may have lost him . But he is courteous about it : His Majesty has always been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give up without an argument , having gone so far . " Lady , " he says , " tell your mistress I appreciate her care for me , but tell her that what she proposes is impossible . I could not leave this house where I have been happy to return to one where I was unhappy even though I am no longer happy here . But it is here I belong . It is here I can best worship the Aten and the memory ofof him who  | strengthened me in all I did . I could not abandon them to return to the Chief Wife . " " I do not believe she wishes you to abandon them , Your Majesty , " I say . " She worships the Aten as you do . Together you can give him new life in the Two Lands , where few now favor him . And as for His late Majesty Smenkhkara " lie flinches at the name , but I go bravely on as Her Majesty would wish " I believe Her Majesty fully respects your grief for him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her Majesty , " I conclude quietly , " has suffered much , and learned much , in these last three years . I think she will be happy only to have you returned to her side , and well again . " " Yes , " he says gloomily , distracted and as if to himself , " I am not well . . . . " " Then come to the North Palace , Your Majesty ! " I urge . " Come back to those who will love and care for you ! Do not remain here where you are so unhappy and alone . They do not really care for you hereno one does . I think Your Majesty knows this , in his heart . " Again I have dared greatly in saying such candid things : but I feel I must . And it appears that I have been right , for now he turns finally , draws himself back in his throne and again looks me full in the face . " It would be nice , " he says , so forlornly that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cared for me again . " " Then return to the North Palace tonight ! " I exclaim . " Give the orders ! Receive Her Majesty ! Leave here with her ! And restore yourself tomorrow to the power that grief has driven from your hands ! " He looks at me thoughtfully for a very long time , during which I hardly dare breathe for fear I will wrongly affect his decision . " Well " he says at last . " Return to those who love you , Majesty ! " I dare exclaim , encouraged by his hesitation . " Aye and Horemheb would be much upset , " he says in a faraway tone , and I can see him **47;561;TOOLONG again " but if it were done swiftly and without warningif they did not know until I appear tomorrow at the Window of Appearances what my intentions areif I perform wonders again for Kemet , my people " " Then Your Majesty will do it ! " I cry joyfully . He reaches out a long , thin hand and clutches mine with a desperate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Go and tell my wife , " he says in a hurried , almost frightened voice , " that I will receive her at midnight tonight and we will go to the North Palace ! "  | " Majesty ! " I cry , and leaving the throne of Kemet , where I had never expected to sit in all my life and of course never will again , I kneel at his feet , lift the hem of his garment and press it to my lips . He places a hand gently on my head . " Go , now ! " he says with an excited urgency . " The Lady Anser-Wossett has served the Two Lands well this day ! " " Thank you , Majesty , " I say humbly , backing out of his presence . The last I see of him is the misshapen figure leaning forward intently on the throne , the long , narrow eyes wide with thought , the mind far away but alive again now , no longer dull , no longer dead , as he contemplates with an evident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have succeeded beyond the wildest hopes of Her Majesty and myself . Acting entirely on Her Majesty 's intuition , we have caught him at that exact moment at which even the deepest mourning becomes boring and it is time for life to resume . As I leave the Palace I become aware that Hatsuret is signaling me insistently from the small crowd of watchers that always idles about the gates . He wants me to meet him in the market-place . He , too , has an urgency about him . I consider for a second whether it can do harm . I know I will tell him nothing of what has occurredand perhaps I can find out something from him that will be helpful in furthering Their Majesties ' plans . With the slightest of movements I return his nod . When my carriage reaches the market-place I order the driver to stop and wait in a shady corner . I dismiss my escort of soldiers and send them on their way back to the North Palace , asking their captain to tell Her Majesty only : " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself beside a vegetable vendor 's stand and pretend to inspect his offerings while I wait for Hatsuret . Presently , he comes . Word has reached me from the captain of the guard that " The Lady Anser-Wossett has good news , " though she has not yet returned from the market-place to give it me herself . She likes to go to the market from time to time , though it is not necessary for her to do so , since my  | steward Huya oversees the buying for the North Palace . ( Poor Huya ! He has been cowed since the decision to depict the coronation durbar in his tomb as the Great Wife and I desired . But I have told him nothing was his fault : he and Meryra simply got caught in the midst of a family argument , and all is well . Nonetheless , he still finds difficulty meeting my eyes sometimes . ) So Anser-Wossett has not returned but her message indicates that our wildest hopes must have come true . He is going to accept my plan : he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anew , for me and for poor threatened Kemet . For this I have dreamed and planned and plotted for a year , ever since the murders of Smenkhkara and Merytaten . I did not know , for a time , whether I could recover from those two deaths , which were in considerable measure due to me . When I mentioned Smenkhkara 's name that night during our family conference , I did not contemplate that he would be removed so swiftly and so violently : I had thought some gentler means , such as banishment to wretched Kush or the Red Land , might be used . But I suppose my father Aye and Horemheb had no choice : he would not have gone , Akhenaten would not have permitted it , and nothing would have been achieved . So , though I cried wildly for a time when I heard the news , for my hapless , well-meaning cousin and even for my shrewish , unnatural daughterbut most of all for myself who had been party to such a dreadful thingI did not cry overlong . I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my own happiness ) had been removed , and that we could now go forward to a better day for all of us . I did not contemplate how terribly he might be shattered , for I had refused to believe the signs that revealed how deeply he cared for his brotherand I had also grievously misjudged the determination of my father and the true nature of my half brother Horemheb . I am now desperately afraid of them both ; and so , I think , is Queen Tiye . We have not discussed it very much , but when we have she has spoken with a profound and still grieving sadness of the son whose murder she had to agree to in order to save , she thought , the son who must be saved if he was to continue to wear the Double Crown and discharge the great responsibilities of the Two Lands . Except that her plan , too , went awry : he still wears the Double Crown but he has retired almost entirely from the rule of the Two Lands . It rests now with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in particular , is growing ever more restive as he exercises many of the rights of power without the sanction of power .  | This the Great Wife senses as well as I ; and both of us , now , are coming to perceive how iron is his will and how ruthless his determination . We know what his ultimate ambition is , because Sitamon , embittered by his refusal to marry her , recently told the Great Wife . Yet he can not possibly be Pharaoh , for poor little frightened Tut comes next , and soon now he will be married to Ankhesenpaaten , which will sanctify his full claim upon the throne ; and where does Horemheb fit then ? We can not see : yet we know he dreams of it , and we know that such a dreamer is dangerous indeed to Pharaoh . So both Queen Tiye and I have come to realize that what we were responsible for has not worked out at all as we thought it would . Just yesterday when she was visiting mehaving finally come down from Thebes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for herself what all reports have told herwe admitted this to one another . Finding that she agreed with me , I decided to put into effect at once the plan that is apparently going to save the Good God and the Two Lands , at last . ( It is now nearing dinnertime . Ra is sinking in the west . The Nile has turned to copper . Across on the other bank the cultivated lands that serve Akhet-Aten , and the distant mountains beyond , are becoming purple and misty in the dying light . Anser-Wossett should be back by now . I shall send very shortly to find out where she is , for she must report to me in detail all that she said to my husband , and all that he said to her . ) Actually I did not need the approval of the Great Wife for my plan , because I have become determined to do it . And actually she did not say in so many words that she does approve . But I could tell from her expression that she was relieved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have both desired so desperately in this past year : the beginning of the campaign to restore Kemet to all her glories , which will be long and hard because of Akhenaten 's almost complete uncaring for it in these recent months . For me , of course , it will mean even more : the return to my side of him whom I have loved since a child and still love , despite all the insults and indignities he has heaped upon me and the coldness with which he has treated me since he put me aside to take Smenkhkara in my place . It has not been an easy time for mesometimes I have thought I would die of it , so bitterly has it hurt my heartbut I have been strong and I have persevered , as becomes a daughter of Aye and Chief Queen of the Two Lands . Now it is all going to come right at last , as I have always felt it would if I could just be brave enough to withstand the bur-  | den that might have crushed me completely were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I hope and believe , it will mean happiness for him who has had so little in his tense and lonely life . As a boy , before his ailment , when he was Crown Prince , handsome , vigorous , joyously active with all the world waiting for his rule , I know he was happy . I think that perhaps for six years after we were married , while our six daughters were entering the world and our childhood love for one another was ripening into maturity , that he was happy with me . Then he began to lose heart because his worship of the Aten , even though he built this great city in the Sole God 's honor , was not spreading to the people . He destroyed Amon and the other gods , he abandoned me , he turned to Smenkhkara . Perhaps he was happy with his brother , but I do not believe it , for still the Aten failed to win the people , and still his dreams of a universally loving world under a universally loving god did not materialize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , too , only lasted three yearscould not last more , for Kemet 's sake . All his young beauty lost , all his dreams frustrated , all his plans gone wrong : I do not think Nefer-Kheperu-Ra has been very happy with his life . It has made me love and pity him the more . . . . Even when he turned against me I could not stop . In this past year word has come to me through my father , through Horemheb and through Anser-Wossettin just a moment I will send for her , I am anxious to know that all is ready for my planof how completely he has abandoned physical pride and self-respect . It has been obvious to all of Kernet that he has virtually abandoned civil government , but since he has kept himself mostly hidden in the South Palace in the past twelve months only the Family and his immediate servants have been aware of his personal deterioration . Anser-Wossett from time to time sees Peneptah , the bearded scribe who assists Amonhotep , Son of Hapu , and from him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others have not knownthe lateness of the hour at which he rises , the listlessness with which he shuffles about the Palace , the growing disinterest in eating , the frequent nocturnal passages when he can not sleep but goes , driven by demonsor the vengeful godsto wander the corridors alone and unbefriended . These things have made me weep many bitter tears and have made my heart cry out to him . . . though when I have tried to convince him of my continuing love and my desire to help he has refused to see me and has continued on his desolate way . But now all that will change : I shall make him happy again at last .  | He is coming back I still can not quite believe it ! I do not know what prompted me to organize my plan , to realize by some blessed instinct that now might be the time when he would respondbut somehow I knew . So I formed my household guard of twelve men , giving no explanation to my father or Horemheb , both of whom were curious but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their loyalty , I waited until I was sure I could trust them completelyand then I sent Anser-Wossett to him today , and all has fallen into place beyond my dearest hopes . I shall not truly exult until all has been safely accomplished . But for the first time in many years I , too , believe I will once again be happy , which in my darkest moments I thought had been denied me forever . It is nearing time to go to my formal banquet room for dinner , and Anser-Wossett must come to me . We have much to talk about . I rise from the bench before my mirror , where I have been thinking these things , hardly daring to acknowledge the growing hope and excitement I have seen in my eyes ( which still are beautiful , though very sadbut much less sad now , and very soon , I hope , not sad at all ) , and go to the door , open it and clap my hands for a servant . For a moment none are about , the busy palace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my lesser ladies in waiting coming toward me down the long painted corridor . Amazingly , she weeps . What can it mean ? What can it mean ? My heart feels a sudden terror , I do not know why . But very soon , in a voice racked with sobs , she tells me , and I do . I know now where Anser-Wossett is . Her battered body was tossed off at the palace gate a few minutes ago by a chariot that fled away , its driver masked and unrecognized . It was obvious she had been tortured before she died . So all must be known to someone who wishes us ill . My poor Anser-Wossett who has been with me so many years ! Oh , my heart grieves , it grieves ! Good , faithful , loving , loyalah , such evil , such evil ! May the Aten help us now ! . . . For many minutes I stand like stone while the lady weeps beside me . I am too stunned to weep , two stunned to think . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am not a daughter of Aye and Chief Queen of the Two Lands for nothing . My heart which has known so much sorrow can stand a little more . I shall harden myself , I shall meet what comes without fear . Right now there is just one thing to do : go to my husband and rescue him . I call the captain of my guard , I give him the orders , I prepare myself  | hastily to leave . I wear my golden shift and my Blue Crown , for I go as a Queen with my head held high and my face once againas always when my people see mecommanding and composed . I am Nefertiti and I will not be denied . No one sees us leave the Palace and start across the city whose many thousands , all unknowing of the events that are occurring in their midst to affect their lives forever , are placidly eating before their peaceful hearths . A chill wind is driving off the Nile now that night has truly come . It is turning winter and soon it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We will win this battle and , with Father Aten 's help , regain in happiness our full rule and glory . He has made many errors : no doubt I have . But from now on we will do all things right for the Aten and for our beloved kingdom and people of the Two Lands . Now is this hour of final reckoning , before Horemheb and I go to my sister to secure her compliance in the terrible thing we must do , I seek a balance between the good I have known of my nephew Akhenaten and the evil he has brought upon our beloved kingdom and people of the Two Lands . I must also , if I can , accept the fate that very likely is about to fall equally upon my beautiful , misguided daughter , who has suffered so much and whom I have loved so much as things have spun down and down with increasing rapidity for them both . Of my nephew Nefer-Kheperu-Ra , what is one to say ? I loved him as a handsome child loved him as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of love has been less than the one before , and steadily my dismay and mistrust have grown . I have forgiven him so much : we all have forgiven him so much . The balance finally drawn must , I fear , come down against him . We could accept , I think , the early attempts to establish the Atenthe murder of my brother Aanen , who asked for itthe attempt , for which f was directly responsible , to give the Aten equal stature but still  | maintain Amon and the other gods . We could even accept his desperate and pathetic attempts to achieve the son Nefertiti could not give him by marrying his three oldest daughters , and by them having three daughters , all puny and mercifully now dead . But none of us has been able to accept these years just past when all the gods were destroyed , and when amiable and foredoomed Smenkhkara shared the throne , met his fate , and left his brother to decline ever more swiftly into the almost animal squalor we now see when we visit him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made some earnest if ineffectual attempts to keep the government going during the period he shared the throne , while Akhenaten became ever more lost in his fading dream of the Aten . Horemheb , my other son Nakht-Min and I did what we could to help , an assistance Smenkhkara accepted gratefully , for he was very young . But it did no good : the whole thing continued to slide both within Kemet and on our borders , until the awful night when Nefertiti inspired us to kill him , and his mother , my sister the Great Wife , agreed . We thought then , foolishly as it turned out , that the shock of his brother 's death would drive Akhenaten out of his lethargy and , after a period of suitable mourning , bring him back to active rule . We also thought it would make him compliant to our growing conviction that Amon and the other gods must be restored , if not to their full power , then at least to a position befitting their place in all our ancient traditions . But neither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the lonely and haunted recluse to whom we report the formalities of our rule in his name , but whose slovenly person we can hardly bear to look at , and whose intelligence , while still great , is increasingly far away in the depths of mourning and the pointless worship of the Aten . Or so we had thought until tonight . Suddenly tonight he has revived and with my daughter 's aid threatens to resume with all his old demanding persistence the power of the Double Crown and the active and unrelenting pursuit of his sacrilegious Sole God . For perhaps an hour after Horemheb came to me with the news Hatsuret and his hidden acolytes had tortured out of poor Anser-Wossett ( a violence I would never have condoned had I known about it , unless it were absolutely necessary : I think frightening her with it would have been enough , though she was always fiercely loyal to my daughter and it might not have been ) I remained silent in my chair , staring blankly at the wall while a thousand things raced through my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had been with me discussing matters of government , and ordered him to tell no one . He  | looked deeply hurt and offended , for it is the first time in many years that we have not sought his wisdom in our family councils . But I told him that the responsibility now rested solely on my sister , myself and my son Horemheb . Wounded , he went away . For a moment I had a pang of uneasiness and regret ; then I put it aside . We can count on his loyalty , we always have . He will tell no one , and it is better that on this final dreadful occasion he not be directly involved . It is truly our responsibility alone , for we , even more than his old tutor , have made Akhenaten what he is . So I sat and thought , while patiently Horemheb sat with me . He made no attempt to influence me , he spoke no word . He simply watched me with a complete and controlled attentiveness . He is very shrewd , Horemheb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way for him to reach the place he would like to fill but he is an invaluable assistant to me in all that must be done to save the Two Lands . So a few moments ago I finally turned to him and asked : " What would you suggest , my son ? " " There can be only one solution , " he replied in a somber voice . " I shudder to contemplate it , " I said . " So do I , " he said calmly , " but we have no choice . " " Can we not somehow banish him ? " He looked at me long and steadily before he replied with a quiet cer-tainty : " Father , you know perfectly well it would not work . Nefer-KheperuRa perhaps has nothing left but his stubbornness , but he does have that . The wound must be cleansed completely , and it must be cleansed immediately , now the opportunity has presented itself . We must close our hearts , harden our resolve , ask the blessing of Amon and the gods , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could ever return to power . " " To kill the Living Horus , " I almost whispered , so awful is it to contemplate , even now , " is no light thing , my son . " " I do not approach it lightly , " he said with the same implacable calm . " I approach it as the thing that must be done to save the Two Lands from utter and final destruction , both within and without . " " Tut should be told . " " Tut is a child , " he said with a sudden harshness . " We will tell him when it is over . It will be time enough then for him to know that what he fears has happened . As Regent , I will inform him in due course . First , it must be done . "  | " As Regent ' ? " I echoed sharply . " Who said you will be Regent , my son ? " " You have just heard me say it , Father , " he said , staring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was so taken aback by his sheer effrontery that I could not speak . Then I replied in the cold tones that have made many men tremble at the wrath of the Councilor Aye : " I shall be Regent , and there will be no further discussion of it ! " " You are old , Father , " he said , " and I am still in my forties , still relatively young and vigorous . And I have the army at my back . It would ill become us to engage in an unseemly battle for control of the King . " " You have some of the army at your back , " I said , for it is true , he has many divisions loyal to him , " but I also have many members of it who still stand in awe and complete loyalty to the Divine Father-in-law Aye . Is it civil war you wish us to fall into over the corpse of your cousin Akhenaten ? If so " and my voice was as steely and unrelenting as I have ever made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his headlong flight toward insane ambition and studied me for a very long time , very carefully , while my expression remained stern and never yielding . My eyes met his with an icy sternness as I thought : This is my son . What have I created ? . . . But I shall ever be stronger than he , and he knows it in his heart . And presently I could sense that with an obvious great effort of will he was acknowledging this to himself and abandoning his insane bluff to replace the one man whose consistent strength through more than thirty years has been the true salvation of Kemet in all her troubles . " Very well , " he said at last , very quietly , still not taking his eyes from mine . " But I shall be King 's Deputy , then . " " You may be that , " I conceded , for our strengths are so nearly equal that , though I did not show it , I feared a battle between us as much as he . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course . " " After the occupant of the Window of Appearances is no more , " he said softly ; and though I shuddered again at the enormity of it , I agreed with equal softness , " It is the will of the gods . . . . However , " I added firmly , " there must be no harm to Nefertiti . " " She has already been warned , " he said , " and if she is as intelligent as I know her to be , she will already have abandoned her pathetic plot and be even now preparing herself for graceful widowhood . " " Are you sure of that ? " I demanded . For the first time in our interview he smiled , a slight , wry smile . " No , I am not sure of it , Father . You have bred a family of lions , and as one of them I can not vouch for what one of the others may do . "  | " Your sister must not be harmed , " I said again sternly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is up to her . I hope she will not be . " I made it an order : " You will see to it ! " He gave me a steady look and shrugged . " It is up to her , " he said again ; and turning the subject with a sudden briskness , " We must yet have the approval of the Great Wife before we act . Do you wish to go to her alone , or shall we go together ? " " Together , I think , " I said , and repeated , again with a shudder at the enormity about to engulf us : " The murder of the Living Horus is no light thing . " " Good ! " he said , leaping to his feet . " We must go to her at once , for the time is very short in which to catch him unprepared at the Palace . " " Yes , " I agreed , and also stood up . As I did so there came a frantic pounding on the door . Without announcement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The Queen has left the North Palace ! " he cried . " We must stop her at once ! " " Yes ! " Horemheb exclaimed , starting for the door . Then he paused in mid-step and said slowly , " No , let her come to him . . . . We will meet her there . " " No harm to her ! " I shouted in a terrible voice that made Ramesses turn pale at my fury . But Horemheb gave no sign . " Go to the Great Wife and send me word at once , Father ! " he yelled over his shoulder as they crossed the threshold and started running down the hall . " Tell her it is too late to stop the just vengeance of the gods ! " " I will ! " I shouted back . " But again , no harm to your sister ! " But they were gone at the turning of the corridor and there was no answer . I flung a robe around me against the cold and hastened shouting through the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gates of the lovely little palace my nephew built for his mother in happier days , and now they are escorting me to her private chamber . And now together we must agree upon our last , awful act for the sake of Kemet and the millions who , all unwitting , plunge with us tonight into a future I believe not even the greatest gods can foretell.  | Akhenaten ( Life , health , prosperity ! ) Can it be hope I feel , after all these awful months ? I can scarcely imagine it . Yet do I still have sufficient faith in the word of Nefertiti that I believe it must be so . . . . Only you and I , Father Aten , know the agonies I have gone through since they came to me with word of my brother 's death . The reason was never officially discovered , but for the two of them to die so swiftly and so horribly there could be but one explanation . Someone saw fit to poison them : someone very close to me . I scarcely dare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother , my uncle and my cousin Horemheb , yet there is no other sensible conclusion . Is it any wonder I have retreated into myself to nurse my awful pain and loneliness as best I could ? I have not dared do other , for daily I have lived in fear that presently they would come for me . The Living Horus , Great Bull , Son of the Sun , He Who Has Survived , Living in Truth Forever , Nefer-Kheperu-Ra Akhenaten , King and Pharaoh of the Two Landscowering like a thief in his own palace , terrified of his own family ! Father Aten , it has been dreadful for me . Still , I could do no other . For the seventy days it took to embalm him , I ventured out only to supervise the process . So terrible was my obvious grief that no one ventured to speak to me , let alone harm me , then . I was enwrapped in grief , engulfed in grief , drowned forever , it seemed to me , in grief . I do not recall now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and set in the west during those endless interwoven days and nights : it seems to me only a long , gray blur in which I came and went between the House of Vitality , where the rites went on , and the Palace . Priests of the Aten accompanied me wherever I went , chanting their dirges for the dead . Frequently , for hours at a time , I could not even move , but only lay weeping on the floor before the sculpture of that beloved head that Tuthmose completed for me only a week before he died . I could not believe he was gone , my little brother who grew to be such a comfort to my heart and such a strength to my being . But he was : he was . The mummification of Merytaten I left to others . I scarcely knew when it was completed , gave to Nefertiti and my mother ( how could  | she have the courage , the effrontery and the heartlessness ? ) the task of presiding over her final going beneath the ground in the Royal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notified that it had occurred , but that was only a day before I had to preside at my own grief-filled ceremony . I barely noticed : my daughter 's going moved me very little . I never liked her particularly . She was simply a convenience who , like her mother , could not even bear me a son . She was useful to keep the domestics of the Palace in line : that was all . To Smenkhkara , howevereven now it cuts me like a knife to say that name I gave the most tender and most loving entombment he could possibly have desired . The memory of his sunny nature , always open , generous , undemanding , comforting , supported even as it devastated me . I got through it somehow and arranged it so that all who come after will know how much he meant to me . I used one of the coffins originally prepared for Merytaten , for there had been no time to prepare one suitably ornate for him . Around the head of the one to whom I had given Nefertiti 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Akhenaten , " I caused to be placed the sheet-gold vulture that usually bedecks the crown of a Queen : the golden wings will protect him forever . His body I caused to be mummified , not with arms crossed over the chest like a King 's as though to carry scepters , but as a Queen with his left hand closed upon his breast and his right arm stretched along his side : thus will all know the position he held in my life . And at the foot of his coffin I caused to be inscribed , as if from him to meas the God who will someday raise him from the afterworldthe prayer I composed myself in one of those occasional curious periods of detachment that come in the midst of deepest grieving : " I shall breathe the sweet air that issues from thy mouth . My prayer is that I may behold thy beauty daily , that I may hear thy sweet voice belonging to the North Wind , that my body may grow young with life through thy love ; that thou mayest give me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live by it ; and that thou mayest call upon my name forever and ever and it shall not fail in thy mouth . " Thus will all know how tenderly and eternally he touched my heart . Then I came away to return here to the Great Palace and resume the seclusion from which I have not , from that day to this , gone forth . At first I took no interest at all in government . Aye , Horemheb and Nakht-Min came to me as in a recurring dream , their words meaningless , their reports incomprehensible . Somehow Kemet continued to be governed , by them but not by me . I knew this was wrong , that I should bestir and reassert myself , but a great lethargy held my heart .  | And in spite of what I sensed about their part in the murder of my brother , I felt that I could trust them : I was still the Living Horus , and none , not even they who had wounded me so deeply , would dare betray me . More lately , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grief and lethargy have held me prisoner . I have eaten less and less , grown thinner and more grotesque . With increasing carelessness I have allowed my physical appearance and cleanliness to decline . Again , I have known this was not right , that pride and the dignity of Pharaoh should require me to do otherwise . But again , the great pain and dullness have made me listless and uncaring . So it has gone until a few short days ago . I do not know exactly what inspired the turning point , unless it was my surviving brother and now my heir , who came to me with a childish concern because he had not seen me for many months . Timidly he came alone in his chariot , surrounded by soldiers , from the North Palace where he lives with Nefertiti . Timidly he sent in word that he was here and asked to be admitted to my presence . My first instinct was to say no , as I have refused , until today , all requests from my wife . Then something made me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realization of how little , how lonely and how lost he must feel in the midst of all these violently unhappy grownups ; and so I reconsidered and bade them bring him in . " Brother , " he began , after he had prostrated himself dutifully at my feet and I had raised him up , " Your Majestyhow are you ? " It was asked very simply and directly , as befits a child ; and it revived with a sudden rush all the affection I have always felt for little Tut , who was such a happy baby and now has been made tense and over-old by all that has happened in his eight brief years . " I am not well , Brother , " I responded , beckoning him to sit beside me on the empty thronethe first of the only two I have so honored " but your visit makes me feel better . " " Oh , " he said , eyes wide and earnest , " I am so glad . We have all been worried about you . " " Have you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardly believed itat least not of my mother , Aye and Horemheb . " You are very kind . " " I have brought you a present to make you happy , " he said , and held out a brown little hand , clenched tight . Slowly he unfolded it , eyes gleaming with excitement , to reveal an exquisite pale blue faience pendant of the god Thoth in his aspect of the baboon . I still have a liking for Thoth , whose priesthood in the old days was quite small and never any real threat to me ; and besides , he is the god of wisdom , scribes , learning and the arts , all of which I have respected and en-  | couraged all my life . But I did not at once accept the gift , for through my mind there ran a sudden terrible warning : Beware ! They killed Smenkhkara with poison . Perhaps they have sent this innocent child to wreak their evil upon you . Beware ! " It is beautiful , " I said , keeping my voice calm but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Why do n't you take it ? " he inquired in a puzzled tone , his eyes concerned . " It will not hurt you . " " Are you sure ? " I asked , unable to keep the concern from my voice . " Look ! " he said . " It does not hurt me . " And he lifted it , turned it over , shook it , placed it next to his face , sniffed it , licked itall with a deliberate and knowing air that made me realize sadly that even at his age he must have come to understand the evil of his elders and the method they used to wreck my life . " No , " I agreed , smiling as I took it from his hand , " it does not hurt you and you have bravely proved that it will not hurt me . I shall treasure it and wear it on a gold chain around my neck as evidence that there is one of my family , at least , who cares for me . " " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upset by my bitter tone ; but I am afraid too much has happened for me to conceal my bitterness . " You are generous to think so , little Tut , " I said , " and I pray you may never have cause yourself to think otherwise . But I must warn you to be careful , as I must be careful , for the Son of the Sun has many enemies . " " I know it , " he said , looking suddenly quite as old as his apparent knowledge of the dangerous world in which we live . " It is very hard being Pharaoh , is it not ? " " For me , " I said somberly , " it has been very hard . But for you , when it comes your time , I hope and believe it will be better . " " I am frightened , " he said in a wistful little voice that caused me to take his hand quickly and give it a reassuring squeeze . " You must not be , " I said firmly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said in the same remote little voice , " and that then I will have to be Pharaoh . And I am frightened . " " I do not intend to die yet , " I said , sounding more positive than I often am about this : often it seems I may die naturally at any moment , even if they do not succeed in making me die unnaturally . " It will be many years before you must assume the Double Crown . By then you will be a man , big and strong , and no one will dare frighten or do harm to the new Son of the Sun . " " I hope so , " he said in the same wistful fashion . " Oh , Brother , I hope so ! "  | " It will be as I say , " I told him emphatically . " You must be brave and patient and never fear ; and when your time comes , you will be a good Pharaoh and do great things for Kemet . I know it . " " Are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desperate in his search for reassurance . " I am sure , " I said with a flat certainty I indeed was far from feeling : for the evil that threatens me may yet consume him . " I , Nefer-KheperuRa Akhenaten , Living Horus , Son of the Sun , decree it ! " " Well , " he said with a sudden relieved sigh that told me my firmness had been accepted , " I 'm glad of that . " His manner became suddenly grave and dignified , he rose from the throne and bowed low . " Now I must return to the North Palace , Your Majesty , if I may have your leave to depart . " " You may , little Brother , " I said with equal gravity . " Come to me again when you wish to talk . " " I will , " he promised solemnly , and added , with an innocent emphasis that told me much , " I like you . " " Thank you , Neb-Kheperu-Ra , " I said , formally using the name the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the throne . " You are always welcome in my house . " " Good ! " he said with a quick smile that lighted up his face . " Be of good cheer , Brother , and do not worry . All will come well for you . " " And for you too , little Tut , " I said , " and do you never doubt or forget it . " " I will try not , " he said , falling abruptly solemn again . " But at times it is not easy . " After he had gone the glow of his earnest and loving little being stayed with me for a while , a bright , even if troubled , note in my weary life . But I was deeply disturbed by the fears he revealed to me . Even its youngest member , apparently , is haunted by the ghosts of the House of Thebes . Later I reflected that he had not even mentioned Nefertiti . I wondered if this might not have been her deliberate design , to send him as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and make me weaken toward her . But I did not weaken , for at that time I was still too gone in grief and resentment , and the things that had caused me to put her from me in the first place . But presently I began to think ; and in these past few days I have found to my surprise , with a growing inward excitement , that I am beginning to dwell a little less upon the past and a little more upon the future . In some subtle way I can not quite define , my heart and mind are coming to life again after their long , dark passage .  | And so today Anser-Wossett , with her never shaken loyalty to Nefertiti and her honest concern for me , opened the way . She was the key , as I know Nefertiti hoped she would be . The door is unlocked and I am ready to come forth . I do truly believe that this is hope I feel at last , 0 Father Aten , you who have sustained me in all my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I now realize possesses a love for me that nothing can ever shatter , which revives in me my love for herwe will resume our rule of our dear Two Lands . I have given the order . All is ready . The guards are expecting her , they will let her in , we will go to the North Palace and from there , tomorrow , to the Window of Appearances to announce the resumption of our rule . It is now three hours to midnight . I have only to wait patiently , here on my throne where none will dare disturb me , and very soon I will see her again . And then , Father Aten , perhaps your son Akhenaten will find some little happiness in the world once more . With excitement and anticipation growing eagerly in my heart , I am told that Amonhotep , Son of Hapu , would see me . I send word that he is to be admitted . I shall not tell him our plans , but he is my old , dear friend and teacher , and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I arrange myself upon the throne , put on my wig which I have not worn for days until my visit with Anser-Wossett this afternoon , straighten my linen shift , prepare to greet him with the smile of old friendship and affection . He appears in the doorway , face distraught , eyes filled with great agitation . . . and hope , which I now know I should never have allowed to bemuse me , dies . " Majesty ! " he cries with a frantic urgency . " Flee , Majesty ! Flee ! They are coming to do awful things ! You must flee , I beg of you ! Flee ! Do not hesitate , do not delayflee ! " " Who is coming ? " I demand sharply , my voice succumbing to its damnable emotional croak . " Who is coming to my palace ? Tell me . " " Horemheb , Rarnesses , Hatsuret and their troops . " " For what purpose ? " " I do not know , Nefer-Kheperu-Ra , " he says , using my name with old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you and Her Majesty . She has left the North Palace . They seem to know she is coming here they are coming here . Please ! Please , I beg of you as a father which I have almost been to you all these unhappy yearsgo ! Please go ! Imme-diately ! " " Where can I go that they will not find me ? " I ask him bitterly ; and suddenly I reject it all , him , them , everythingexcept my dear wife  | who is riding to me swiftly through the night , her plan apparently exposed , her life in jeopardy as I now know mine is . A great calm and radiance settle on me , Father Aten , coming from you to your son Akhenaten . I know what I must do . " Her Majesty is indeed coming here , " I tell this old man who is almost a stranger to me now , so remote does he seem in his terror . " She is being very brave . I can be no less brave . I shall go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dare harm us . " " They will , Majesty ! " he cries in anguish as outside we hear the distant approaching sounds of many men and many horses . " They will ! Son of the Sun , you must go ! " " No , " I say quietly , " I will not go . " And I start toward the door , noting with disdain that Amonhotep , Son of Hapu , that great sage whom we have looked up to and revered all these years , is clinging desperately to my sleeve , weeping like a woman . He is but a poor thing , after all . I go armored in our love for one another , and for you , Father Aten . I am Nefer-Kheperu-Ra Akhenaten . She is Nefer-neferu-aten Nefertiti . And we will prevail . He tries to shake off my hand with a furious impatience , he hobbles ahead of me along the corridor as fast as he can . He is like one possessedbut of a weird otherworldly serenity I am unable to penetrate . They are coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me while there still is time . He could fleeeven now , with luck , they could manage to escape and flee togetherand from some hidden place seek friends to rise and put down their enemies . . . but he will not flee , for he knows , as I know , that they no longer have any friends and their tragic story is at last played out . So I weep as I cling to him , seeking even now to hold him back . As we near the entrance he turns upon me with a sudden violent movement , eyes still remote but blinded briefly by a savage rage . " Let me go ! " he snaps , yanking his sleeve finally from my grasp . " Get back ! "  | Furiously he stares at me , helplessly I stare back . Outside the sound of approaching troops comes nearer . " Yes , Son of the Sun , " I murmur at last through my tears , " I will let you go . " He turns instantly and resumes his shuffling , stumbling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with terror , waiting to fling them open at his command . " Open ! " he shouts with a terrible urgency . They obey , tumbling over one another in their fright . We look out upon a garish scene . A wild wind is blowing off the Nile , great torches hiss back the night . There is a jumble of horses , troops , menand a single beautiful woman , standing straight and composed in her chariot as it pauses on one side of the courtyard to confront that of her half brother which has just drawn up on the other side . For a moment we are all frozen in one of those awful spells that last forever in memory and , perhaps , in time . Over Akhenaten 's shoulder I can see them staring , first Nefertiti and Horemheb at one another , then the two of them at Akhenatenhe looking from each to each and back again , revealing nothing in a face that now is as composed as hers , serene and unafraid . A breathless silence fills the world . The wind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the horses and the dry rustling of the palms keeps us in tenuous touch with reality . We are figures of stone , awaiting the word that will start us to life . It comes at last from him , in a voice that miraculously rings clear and commanding through the square . " Why do you come here , Cousin ? What business have you with your King and Pharaoh at this strange hour ? " Horemheb stares at him , he and Nefertiti at Horemheb . Finally Horemheb speaks , his face working with emotion but his voice filled with a terrible determination . " We have come to arrest Your Majesties and remove you forever from the rule of the Two Lands , " he says , and a great shuddering sigh goes up from the trembling soldiers , the terrified servants and the few late wanderers of the city who have been attracted by the unusual commotion . " You speak treason , Cousin , " Akhenaten says quietly , his face betraying no emotion other than a calm conviction that he will prevail . Abruptly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " There is a stirring among the troops , an uneasy movement , the exchange of many awed and frightened glancesbut they have had their orders and although most are simple peasant lads confronted by the awesome age-old mystery of their Pharaoh , they stand firm . Horemheb is their leader , and commands the world .  | " Arrest him ! " Akhenaten shouts again , his voice now croaking with a furious anger that is frightening in its intensity . . . but they do not move . " ARREST HIM ! " he shouts for the third time . . . and still they do not move . The silence returns . Our dreadful paralysis has enveloped us again . None stirs . A stillness as of death lies on us now . " Your Majesties , " Horemheb says at last , face still filled with emotion but voice implacable , " had best come quietly so that no one will be hurt . " " No ! " Nefertiti cries , her voice as implacable as his , ringing firm and fearless in the chilling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the trembling hands of her driver and turns to Akhenaten , standing rigid on the topmost step . " Husband , " she says , still in the same clear , untroubled voice , " come with me and let us leave this traitorous dog to eat his vomit as befits him . Come ! " And she slaps the reins across the backs of her horses , who whinny and start forward . Instantly the world goes mad . " Stop her ! " Horemheb shouts in a terrible voice . " Let her through on pain of death and the eternal curse of Pharaoh through all time , forever and ever ! " Akhenaten shouts in fury equally terrible . For the slightest of moments the world hangs suspended . Then the terrified but obedient soldiers tumble forward , her chariot is surrounded , the horses scream and rear high as someone stabs them and their entrails begin to spill upon the stones . Wild shouts mingle with the horses ' screams as the soldiers seek to strengthen one another 's resolve . The dust swirls up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is hurried away by the racing wind , the melee emerges again in all its awful excitement . At its center stands Horemheb , holding the reins of the dying horses . Straight and proud , eyes fierce , expression fearless and enraged , Nefertiti stands at the front of her chariot . Behind her stands Hatsuret , a glistening battle-ax raised high above his head . For what seems an eternity but can only be a moment she stays so in the wildly flickering light of the great bronze-shielded torches , beautiful , brave , indomitable and unconquerable . " Now ! " Horemheb shouts . Hatsuret raises still higher the gleaming ax . So fast the eye is unable to follow , it flashes for a split second and comes down to cleave forever that perfect , timeless skull .  | A heavy , unbelieving groan comes from the stunned soldiers and the watching crowd , a wild animal scream from Akhenaten . Desperately I clutch his arm , with a strength I did not know my old bones could muster I drag him back inside before any can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I shout at the servants , frantically they leap to slam shut and bolt the massive doors . " Majesty ! " I cry . " You must flee ! Oh , my dear son , I beg of you , please , please , please , come with me ! " He is in a daze , he does not know where he isbut he obeys . Blindly he staggers away with me down the corridor . At our backs we hear the first heavy crash of the battering rams . Somehow I hurry him , half falling , half stumbling , leaning on me for support I am almost afraid I can not give , I am so desperate and frightened and my heart hurts so as I struggle to breathe , down the seemingly endless corridors to the private entrance at the back . Miraculously Horemheb has not thought of this : perhaps he could not imagine her death would not deliver the Good God helpless in his hands . Only Akenaten 's troops are on guard , and they have as yet had no word of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irresolute , and in that moment he comes back to me . " Chariot , " he croaks . " Chariot ! " " Yes ! " I cry , and give the command . Sped by my haste and agitation , the guards spring to obey . In a moment a chariot with two horses stands before us . In the next , the back gates have been swung open . With a strange , startling agility , calling upon who knows what reserves of strength and terror , he leaps up as I have not seen him do since he was a child and grasps the reins tightly it his long , thin hands . " Majesty " I cry , and start to clamber up with him . But savagely he pushes me backsavagely , but , I think , quite impersonally , for I know he hardly realizes I am there . " No ! " he cries . " I go ! " And lashes the horses , who leap forward , and vanishes in the night of the still sleeping , unsuspecting city . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desperation and I know that they will find him there . I bow my head and weep bitterly for Nefer-Kheperu-Ra Akhenaten , tenth King and Pharaoh of the Eighteenth Dynasty to rule over the land of Kemet , whose living body I know I shall never look upon again . . . . Some time latersome little time , though to me in my utmost agony  | of soul it has seemed very long indeed I hear the crash of the great doors going down , a swirl of soldiers jangling through the halls . Ever nearer comes the voice of Horemheb . I sit upon the ground and draw my robe over my head and wait humbly for his coming : for I know that for me as well he means Death . But amazingly it does not come . I am aware of a sudden quiet , I am conscious that he is standing over me . Slowly I draw my robe away and look up with tear-filled eyes into his strained and ravaged face . For a long time our eyes hold in silence . Then at last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my head . I prepare myself instantly for the end of life . But again he astounds me . " Do not feel too badly , old friend , " he says softly , " and do not think I will blame you for what you have done this night . You have done what you believed you had to do " he pauses and his voice grows infinitely sad , with a depth of feeling I had not known was in him , my bright and clever " Kaires " who came to us so long ago " and so , I think , have we . " With an abrupt harshness he cries , " Bring my horse ! I go alone to the Northern Tombs ! " There is an obedient jumble of responseand he is gone . I draw my robe tighter over my head , I lock my hands around my knees , I rock back and forth in desolation for our poor lost Akhenaten and our beautiful Nefertiti . Far below me the city sleeps . Here where I have come so often , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my protector , my friend ; you open for me the peaceful ways . For your son Akhenaten you will set all things right and make the world to sing again . You will restore to me my beloved wife , who has not died , and my dearest brother , who has not died , and together we will rule in happiness and love for all our people , forever and ever , for millions and millions of years . It seems to me that somewhere , but a little while ago , there was horror in the night . I can not remember exactly what it was , I remember iight and voices shouting , there seems to be a great terrorand then it  | eludes me . I can not understand , I no longer remember , I forget and with a smile of infinite peace I think again upon your wonderful and loving grace to me , my Father Aten . You know , my Father Aten , how long and faithfully I have loved you , and how earnestly I have sought to make my people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labored diligently in all things so that they might know how you have made the world to be a beautiful and happy place , and how you love all men and keep them safe , 0 Sole God who rules the universe . I have tried to make them see that they must not be afraid of other gods , that they must not fear the powers of magic , of evil and of darknessthat they must love only you , who are all things good and kind , in whose holy light all men , women , birds , animals , living things are blessed and sheltered and made whole . This I have tried to do , Father Atenonly you know how hard I have tried . I think I may sometimes have made mistakes , for though I am a god I am also human ; but they have been mistakes grown of loving you , and not from evil in my heart . I know my people have not understood me always , and perhaps I have not understood them as much as I would wish ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ save them , as best I could with the benison of your loving guidance . For you I married my daughters , that I might have sons to carry on my line and spread your gospel to all the lands and oceans , not only of Kemet but far beyond our borders , for all men need your loving help . For you I put aside my dear wife Nefertiti for a time and took to my side my dear brother Smenkhkara , who represented to me all that was happy and hopeful in my own youth that was so sadly ended when I fell ill : in his love I thought I might find the strength to help me strengthen you . For you I destroyed Amon and the other gods , so that nothing would stand in the way of your dominance of the world . I have wanted only love , for you , for myself , for everyone . Dimly I seem to remember that there was oppositionbitternessI have a vague feeling that some things were unhappy and did not go right for meI try to remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I can not . Nor do I wish to or need to , protected as I am by your love , resting in peace within your loving arms . It may be all has not gone as I would have wished , it may be I have been wrong about some things . But I have loved you , Father Aten , and I have loved my kingdom and its people , and for them I have sought only happy things . I have tried , Father AtenI have tried : only you know how hard your son Akhenaten has tried ... . Far below I see the tiny spark of a flickering torch , twisting erratically in the wind . I thought the wind might be cold up here , for some-  | how I seem to have come without my robe , clad only in my linen shift ; but I am warm and comfortable in the glow of your love , and I do not feel it . Somehow all the world seems bright and filled with happiness tonight , and all bad things are gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes : the torch rocks as in the hand of one who rides a galloping steed . He has started up the long stone ramp that leads here to the Northern Tombs . His progress slows as his mount takes the steep incline . But he is coming , Father Aten , and to greet him I believe that I will sing to him once more my Hymn that I wrote to you , which I have sung so often to sustain me through all our years together . I do not know who he is who comes : but I think that he can only be moved , as all men are moved , by the loving beauty of what I sing to you . I rise to my feetI seem to have been lying prostrate on the ground , though I can not remember whyand I move to the edge of the terrace that fronts the tombs . I spread my arms wide to embrace my city , my beloved kingdom and the glorious shining world . It is filled for me tonight with a marvelous all-conquering peace in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you : " Thou arisest fair in the horizon of Heaven , 0 Living Aten , Beginner of Life . When thou dawnest in the East , thou fillest every land with thy beauty . Thou art indeed comely , great , radiant and high over every land . Thy rays embrace the lands to the full extent of all that thou hast made , for thou art Ra and thou attainest their limits and subdueth them for thy beloved son , Akhenaten . Thou art remote yet thy rays are upon the earth . Thou art in the sight of men , yet thy ways are not known . " When thou settest in the Western horizon , the earth is in darkness after the manner of death . Men spend the night indoors with the head covered , the eye not seeing its fellow . Their possessions might be stolen , even when under their heads , and they would be unaware of it . Every lion comes forth from its lair and all snakes bite . Darkness is the only light , and the earth is silent when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brightens when thou arisest in the Eastern horizon and shinest forth as Aten in the daytime . Thou drivest away the night when thou givest forth thy beams . The Two Lands are in festival . They awake and stand upon their feet for thou hast raised them up . They wash their limbs , they put on raiment and raise their arms in adoration at thy appearance . The entire earth performs its labors . All cattle are at peace in their pastures . The trees and herbage grow green . The birds fly from their nests , their wings raised in praise of thy spirit . All animals gambol on their feet , all the winged creation live when thou hast risen for them . The boats sail upstream , and likewise downstream . All ways open at thy  | dawning . The fish in the river leap in thy presence . Thy rays are in the midst of the sea . " Thou it is who causest women to conceive and maketh seed into man , who giveth life to the child in the womb of its mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nurse that thou art , even in the womb , who giveth breath to quicken all that he hath made . When the child comes forth from the body on the day of his birth , then thou openest his mouth completely and thou furnisheth his sustenance . When the chick in the egg chirps within the shell , thou givest him the breath within it to sustain him . Thou createst for him his proper term within the egg , so that he shall break it and come forth from it to testify to his completion as he runs about on his two feet when he emerges . " How manifold are thy works ! They are hidden from the sight of men , 0 Sole God , like unto whom there is no other ! Thou didst fashion the earth according to thy desire when thou wast aloneall men , all cattle great and small , all that are upon the earth that run upon their feet or rise up on high , flying with their wings . And the lands of Syria and Kush and Kemetthou appointest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Everyone receives his sustenance and his days are numbered . Their tongues are diverse in speech and their qualities likewise , and their color is differentiated for thou has distinguished the nations . " Thou makest the waters under the earth and thou bringest them forth as the Nile at thy pleasure to sustain the people of Kemet even as thou host made them live for thee , 0 Divine Lord of them all , toiling for them , the Lord of every land , shining forth for them , the Aten Disk of the daytime , great in majesty ! " All distant foreign lands also , thou createst their life . Thou host placed a Nile in heaven to come forth for them and make a flood upon the mountains like the sea in order to water the fields of their villages . How excellent are thy plans , 0 Lord of Eternity ! a Nile in the sky is thy gift to the foreigners and to the beasts of their lands ; but the true Nile flows from under the earth for Kemet . " Thy beams nourish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for thee . Thou makest the seasons in order to sustain all that thou host made , the winter to cool them , the summer heat that they may taste of thy quality . Thou host made heaven afar off that thou mayest behold all that thou past made when thou wast alone , appearing in thine aspect of the Living Aten , rising and shining forth . Thou makest millions of forms out of thyself , towns , villages , fields , roads , the river . All eyes behold thee before them , for thou art the Aten of the daytime , above all that thou host created .  | " Thou are in my heart , and there is none that knoweth thee save thy son , Akhenaten . Thou hast made him wise in thy plans and thy power ! " Triumphantly I conclude , my voice loud and clear in the silent night , ringing over the city , the Nile , Kemet , the world ; and as I do , the horseman reaches the edge of the terrace , dismounts and walks slowly toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that he is carrying a battle-ax . . . and suddenly I remember . I know . Great terror for a second fills my heart , but then you come to me and place your hand tenderly upon my shoulder and strengthen me , 0 Father Aten , and all is peaceful and serene again with me . You are like unto a great light , a Nile of Niles that floods my being . I do not fear him . He will not harm me . I am the Living Horus and I stand armored in your love . " Ah , yes , Cousin , " I say quietly as he advances . " Somehow I knew that you would come for me . " From afar I hear his high , wild keening , whipped to me on the wind as my horse struggles up the long incline to the Northern Tombs . Dimly above me in the blustering night I see his gaunt , ungainly , white-clad figure , arms outstretched as if to bless the world with the obscene mouthings of his empty Aten . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they mean nothing . Only the measured cadence tells me what he thinks he is chanting . From his mouth there issues only gibberish . Upon his face as I approach there shines a light unearthly : it frightens me . He is in some other world , gone from us for good , leaving us at last forever , poor , sad , pathetic Akhenaten . I am filled with horror of what I have done and still must do : yet I tell myself that it has to be , for Kemet , for the Dynasty , and for him . He looks to be at peace at last . It is peace that I am here to bring him . Suddenly lucidity returns and he says the only intelligible words that I have heard : " Ah , yes , Cousin . Somehow I knew that you would come for me . " There is in his voice such a calm acceptance , in his eyes such a look  | of humble yet tranquil submission , as of a wounded animal awaiting with pain yet a marvelous serenity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that almost it turns my legs to water . It brings to my heart such terror and such grief for what I must do that almost I turn and run screaming from the necessary horrors of this dreadful night . Almost it stays my hand . Almost ... . I sit in the window of the little palace he built for me and look my last upon the Nile , my beloved Two Lands and all the lovely world that once was so kind and generous to me . I have done my duty and I can live no more . An hour ago they came to me , my brother and Horemheb , faces ravaged , eyes filled with tears , yet calm with the calmness of men who have accomplished what they believed they must . " It is finished , " Aye says , his voice shaking with emotion , yet firm . " Both are dead . All is over . " Though I had given the word , I yet cry out , a terrible shrieking wail that echoes down the corridors . My heart dies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and all my life of care and devotion for the Two Lands has ended in horror and ruination . Perhaps , as they tell me , it has ended in a new birth for Kemet , a great change that will be for the better after all these sad past years . So do they believe . So would I like to believe . So , perhaps , I can make myself believe . But however it has ended , it has ended for me . After I have wept for a time , my body torn with such savage sobs that they look at me with fright , I tell them that I wish to be buried in the Royal Wadi beside my sons and Nefertiti . Both pledge me this , and I do not think they will betray me . Then I tell them I wish to be alone for a while , and dismiss them . Weeping also , but strong in the certainty that what we have done must be right , they leave me.  | I sit alone at my window and look my last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on this earth for those blessed with the good fortune to enjoy them . I have not been so blessed in many years . The poison gleams beside me in the glass ; I am taking it with wine so that I will not be aware when it goes down . Presently I shall cease my looking , and go to sleep . My mind staggers with horror , my hands reek with blood : I think they shall never be cleansed again . Yet what could we do , for the Two Lands ' sake ? If only we had not ... if only he had not . . . if only . . . but we did . I must think no longer thus . I shall weep forever for my beautiful daughter and lost unhappy Akhenaten , for my sister and for us all . But a new day has come for Kemet . I must put away the past that kills my heart and help my frightened little nephew restore the Two Lands to ma'at and their ancient glory . Tutankhaten ( Life , health , prosperity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my mother , my brother and my beautiful cousin . They were all so kind to me . Who will be kind to me now ? Beside me Ankhesenpaaten , who will be my Queen , weeps softly too . We are alone in all this world . Though but a child , I am King and Pharaoh . But whom can I trust ? What will happen to us , now that the grownups tell me I must rule this sad land of Kemet ?  | He is a pliant lad . If he continues as we desire , he and Amon will many long years together . Tutankhamon ( Life , health , prosperity ! ) Today is the day we must leave the city of my brother and retui Thebes . All about me is bustle , confusion , last-minute packing and pre tion , the final hours of readiness in which everyone rushes about , ries , checks to make sure all is right , hopes to forget nothing , tri , remember everything . All over the city I can hear these sounc Ankhesenpaaten and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gleaming white rooftops , the golden-spired temples , the mil once-crowded streets , gardens , parks , alleyways that he called inte the year I was born and which , on this day thirteen years later , now begin to die . On the river the great barges wait , filled to overflowing with h ( hold goods , gold , jewels , the wealth of what was once his capital for these past four years has been a favorite one of mine . A vast fl jams the Nile from the southern boundary to the north : all the of of the Court , the nobility , the civil servants , their families , servant slaves are packed and ready to leave . We sail at noon , my gold-pa barge in the lead , followed immediately by that of my uncle Aye then by my cousin Horemheb . All the rest will jostle into place an ( long journey upstream will begin amid the hectic shouts of pilots oarsmen , the heavy rhythmic slap of paddles on water , the snag sounds of sails as Shu the wind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who look forward and perhaps , underneath , the quiet bing of those who look back . . . desperately muffled , of course  | cause this is supposed to be a happy day and no one is supposed to feel regret . As we push out from the landing stage at the foot of the long ramp that leads from the now empty North Palaceall its bright hangings stripped from the walls , all my dear cousin Nefertiti 's statues and objects of art removed , all furniture stacked on the barges , even the kitchens emptied totally of pots and panstrumpets will blow , banners will fly , a last dwindling shout will rise wistfully from the small official guard and the handful of poor who remain to serve them . All others have been removed in these recent weeks , sent away to start new lives in villages far from here . The city will stand deserted save for its lonely guardians . It will be lonely too . It is time to say farewell : to Akhet-Aten , to him , and to the dream .. . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe . And so , I think , would I have them believe , for only if they believe it will my Queen and I be permitted to live .. . . I go in deathly fear of my uncle Aye , my cousin Horemheb and evil Hatsuret , who now rules triumphant as High Priest in the fast-rebuilding temple of Amon at Karnak . All goes happily now for him , the monster who killed my brother Smenkhkara , my cousin Merytaten , and last and most awful , my beautiful Nefertiti . At his side with cold confidence my uncle and Horemheb work their will upon me and , through me , upon the Two Lands . Once I believed they did this because they really believed it to be best for Kemet . Now I wonder if it is not just their own glory they seek . When I first became Living Horus , Son of the Sun , King and Pharaoh , I cowered , a child just turning nine , in the dark night of murder and horror that ended the life of Akhenaten , Nefertiti @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death of duty , I realize that now : she did what she felt she had to do for the Two Lands and then bravely paid for it with her own life , and I honor and respect her for it , terrible as it was . But there was no need to kill my brother , no need to kill the Chief Wife . They could have been taken prisoner and sent away somewhere , if that was deemed best for Kemetand perhaps it might have been . I can see that argument now . But there was no need to murder them just at the moment they seemed at last to be returning to one another . There was no need to kill my poor brother , driven insane as he was by all that had happened to him : no need to kill my " second mother , " my sweet Nefertiti whose only crime was loving him . They  | could have been allowed to enjoy in peace whatever happiness they could salvage from the wreck of the bitter past ... . You will say these are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wear a heavy crown , and because of it I am old beyond my years . So I cowered , not knowing whether at any moment I might not be next . I did not really think so , for I was indeed the Living Horus then , I had the blood , the Double Crown was mine by right . These things had not saved Akhenaten , but I thought they might save me , whom they thought untainted by his " heresy . " Beside me trembled my loving Ankhesenpaatenmy niece and four years my senior , but ordained from childhood to be my wife : we thought she too might face the ax of Hatsuret before the night was ended , for now she bore the final right of legitimacy to the throne . So we jumped and screamed and clung to one another fiercely when the door suddenly opened . But it was my uncle Aye and Horemheb , and their words were loving and sweet , and we believed them , and relaxed . " Son of the Sun , " my uncle said gravely , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the glorious throne of your ancestors . The House of Thebes , in you , will be restored to glory . Through you Kemet will once more flourish and be happy . Dear Ankhesenpaaten , you will rule beside him as Chief Queen of the Two Lands , and from his loins and yours will come many fine sons to serve the kingdom and preserve our Dynasty . Do not be afraid , for we are your servants and your friends , and it will be so . " And Horemheb , his hands , though I did not know it then , just washed of the blood of my brother , agreed with equal gravity : " Son of the Sun , it will be so . " And because we were so frightened and wished so desperately to believe them , we did . And presently our trembling ceased , though not our tears for those who were gone ; and soon Queen Kia appeared , her face as sad and ravaged with weeping as ours , and led us away to her quarters , hugged us and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed , where we fell asleep in one another 's arms while she crooned a gentle song all night long to soothe our restless nightmare dreams . ( Dear , kind , gentle Kia , Nefertiti 's faithful friend , and ours ! Where is she now ? I do not know . When I went to Thebes for my coronation she was here ; when I came back she was gone . When I asked my uncle where she was , he said vaguely , " She wished to go and live in the Delta , far from this place . " But secretly I had the three I now regard as my only true friendsmy much older sister Sitamon , young Maya , my schoolmate and now supervisor of the necropolis at Thebes , and my  | cousin , the Vizier Nakht-Mintry to find her for me . They have never been able . ) Very soon thereafter we were taken to Thebes for the ceremonies that would sanctify my place as Pharaoh . Somewhere I heard dimly that there had been a hasty embalmment of Akhenaten and Nefertiti @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or twenty , and that their rotting , half-prepared bodies had then been hurried away in the dead of night to the Royal Wadi here in Akhet-Aten and there been hastily and furtively buried . Only my mother the Great Wife received seventy days and full honors , and now is buried beside them . Meanwhile throughout the length of Kemeton our bordersin embassies sent to King Tushratta of Mittani , King Supp-i-lu-li-u-mas of the Hittites and such other few remaining friends and allies as my brother left usit was being announced that he , my mother and the Chief Wife were dead " of a natural fever " and that I was now the Living Horns and soon to be married to Ankhesenpaaten . So all proceeded as my captors wished . It was a great shock to me to realize that this is what they were , my uncle Aye who had always been so fatherly and kind to me , my cousin Horemheb with whom I had played so happily so many times as baby and childbut I learned it fast , as I have learned much else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throne . Ankhesenpaaten and I were helpless and alone : the game proceeded as they said it must . So there came the great day ; and I will admit that for me , as a child , and for Ankhesenpaaten , who was allowed to watch nearby through dazzled eyes though we were not yet married , it was , although at first almost a disaster , in final impact an awesome and powerfully moving thing . It was only later that we came to realize that ambition , evil , corruption and death underlay it all . For the moment it became a spectacle as overwhelming to us as it was to all who crowded Thebes to witness the triumph of Amon , returning to power through the medium of his small , bewildered , nine-year-old pawn . I had not slept much the night before , falling at last into fitful dozing not long before my uncle came to waken me . So I felt , at first , sleepyeyed and queasy at my stomach . After I retired to relieve myself , he gave me strong tea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first shocked me awake and quieted my stomach , the second seemed to put me into a dreamlike and happy mood . I forgot all that had brought me to this hour and thought only of what lay ahead . A great excitement began to fill my heart . Next there entered to me four white-robed priests of Amon , who under my uncle 's supervision stripped from me my nightclothes and  | washed my body thoroughly in all its parts . ( A little too thoroughly at times , I thought . I like not priests : they make me uneasy on many counts . ) They anointed me with unguents which they told me were sacred to Amon . ( Only eight days before , when my brother was alive , the unguents had been just unguents . Now the priests said mumbo-jumbo over the sticky stuff and it was suddenly sacred to Amon . I was not too bemused to miss the irony of this , but gave no sign . ) Then they placed about me only the pleated kilt of a Pharaoh , in my case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but a skinny child . They placed nothing on my head , no sandals on my feet . Naked save for the kilt , I was escorted into the first courtyard of the temple of Karnak ( its battered doors still scoured by the fires of my brother ) and there joined the solemn processionheaded , of course , by Aye and Horemheb , who fell into step just behind me , and after them by Hatsuret and his highest aides . Following them came many priests and priestesses , not only of Amon but of all the other gods . ( How quickly , in but a week 's time , had they reappeared from hiding to seize anew their long-lost power ! ) These last were shaking sistrums , clashing cymbals , beating drums and blowing on the long bronze trumpets whose mournful mooing must sound like Hathor the cow goddess when she has a bellyache . In response to their sudden raucous noise there came from beyond the walls a great , deep , roaring sound which startled me so that for a moment I turned back in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy , Son of the Sun , " he said , placing a soothing hand on my naked shivering shouldershivering more from chill than fright , actually : it was sunny but cold that day in Karnak . " These are your people , and they love you . " And I believed him , and still do : for they are mine and they do love me , and Ankhesenpaaten as well . It is not their fault that they are unable to know who really rules them . So we moved solemnly forward through the first pylon , erected by my father Amonhotep III ( life , health , prosperity ! ) , and suddenly I was greeted by sights such as I had never seen up to then , but have seen only too much of since . My uncle had tried to forewarn me , but his words had not really prepared me for such a startling spectacle . Priests masked to represent the gods descended upon me from every side , dancing and cavorting and whirling about , uttering welcoming shrieks and , to me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me because , having been raised in the Aten , I had never known these grotesque masks and ceremonies . They did not perceive it then , nor do they realize it now , but in that moment I thought with a sudden blinding flash : But how absurd ! They are children playing children 's games !  | And instantaneously thereafter the thought which only Ankhesenpaaten knows , and shares : My brother was right . It is nonsense , all this . None of this showed upon my face , for by nine I had learned very well how to keep my feelings hidden . I submitted placidly when a priest wearing what I now know to be the falcon head of Horus of the Horizon seized me by one hand , and another , wearing the old man 's mask of Ra in his form of Atum as he sinks in old age into the West , seized me by the other . So excited were they at thus being back in power again that they almost yanked me forward through the second pylon built by my **35;610;TOOLONG @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My naked feet barely skimmed the stones of the courtyard as they hustled me along . Behind me Aye and Horemheb , Hatsuret and the rest had to puff to keep up . All this happened very quickly , you understand , and it ended very quickly too , because suddenly I saw where they were dragging me and I cried out sharply , " No ! " and let myself go limp in their hands so that my sacred body touched the ground and they had to stop in sheer horror of their own profanation of my person . Before me I saw a pool of water , with four masked men standing around it at the points of the compass . Later I learned , of course , that this represented the division of the world into four parts according to the ancient creed of Heliopolis . But to me , a child seeing a mask of an ibis ( Thoth , of course ) , a dog 's curved muzzle and square-cut ears ( Seth ) , and two more falcon beaks ( Horns of Behdet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pool of water , only one terrified thought could come : It is like my distant brother Tuthmose ! They are going to drown me as they drowned him ! And again I shrieked , " No , no , no ! " and sagged upon the ground . Outside the loving roar continued . Inside all was consternation . Instantly my uncle stooped down , angrily ordered the frightened priests aside , scooped me into his arms . Soothingly he murmured in my ear , quieted my trembling , which now was quite genuinely caused by fear , and patiently explained once again the significance of the four who confronted me . Since I could see that they were obviously as terrified of me as I of them , utterly confounded and confused by my reaction , I soon believed him and regained my composure . I slipped out of his arms , stood straight for a second and then marched sturdily forward , head held high . After that I felt no fear and the ceremony proceeded without further difficulty . Reassembled in their positions around the pool , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than ever to be their child-masks , poured water over me from four golden jars . This waterwhich ( 1  | thought as before ) up to Akhenaten 's death eight days ago had been only waternow was presumed to splash the divinity of the gods upon me . Why this was necessary , since I am divine by birth , I did not understand ; but having now resolved to see it through as befitted the Pharaoh I intended to be , I submitted quietly . I was then led on to two chapels between the second and third pylons , one representing the " House of Flame , " the ancient northern sanctuary of Amon , the other the " Great House , " or ancient southern sanctuary . In the first were more priests , more masks : Horns , Neith , Isis , Buto of Lower Kemet , Nekhebet of Upper Kemet , Nephthys and many others ( most of whose names I learned later : they were , as I say , mostly new to me ) chanting my solemn praises . Noisily they accompanied me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I went within . A priestess representing Amon 's daughter , the snake goddess , loomed out of the shadowy interior , around her head a great linen cobra 's hood held stiff by bands of gold . Before I knew what she was doing she had enveloped my body with hers . Her bosom was suffocating and her perfume overpowering . I almost gagged from the strength of it but managed to distract my throat by pretending to cough . This stinking embrace was supposed to represent my being acknowledged as the heir to the throneAmon 's hidden hand supposedly guiding his daughter 's hood to rise behind my head . To me it was simply being crushed by an offensively smelly woman . But I had made up my mind , and accepted it solemnly . Next came a priest named ( I learned later ) Inmutef , accompanied by other priests , each bearing one of the crowns of Kemet ( recovered from my brother 's palace at Akhet-Aten , I learned later : he had not quite dared destroy these ancient symbols ) . Quickly they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ removed the combined white miter and red mortar-cap that represent the Double Crown of the two goddesses Buto and Nekhebet , meaning the Two Lands , Kemet itself ; the atef crown of Ra , the seshed headband , the ibis crown of Thoth , the blue leather khepresh crown , the diadem of two tall plumes similar to those worn by Amon , and the great golden wig , its flaps resting on my chest . Then the khepresh was returned to my head and I was led on through the third pylon to another shadowy chapel ( it is as my brother said : Amon is always cold , hidden and unhealthy ) where I knelt before a rose granite shrine originally dedicated by my great-great-grandfather Tuthmose III ( life , health , prosperity ! ) . There in ringing tones from behind me Hatsuret announced that Amon had confirmed my wearing of the khepresh and henceforth I had sway over all the dominions of  | the sun . To prove this , he announced , I would feel the hand of Amon touch my neck . A cold hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I knew it was the hand of Amon , all right : the hand of Amon that had killed my brother Smenkhkara , my niece Merytaten and my dear cousin Nefertiti . But with great effort I managed to show none of the awful revulsion that withered my body at his touch , and all in attendance breathed a sigh of satisfaction as I rose again to my feet . There followed the conferring of all my titularies and names , including my coronation name of Neb-Kheperu-Ra that the Family long ago selected to be mine if I should become King . I was also hailed , in a great shout that allowed of no rebuttal , " Tutankhamon ! " Not my real name that honors the Aten , but their name that honors their god : " Tutankhamon ! " There was nothing I could do but outwardly accept , though inwardly I made a promise to myself about that . I was then led on to the most ancient innermost sanctuary of Amon where the golden idol , released from his long hiding in the passageway off Horemheb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mysteriously in the gloom . I looked into his hooded eyes and joined as best I could in the prayers chanted by Hatsuret and the rest ; but between the hooded eyes and my own there passed a message that I think the hooded eyes understood . No one else saw itno one to this day save Ankhesenpaaten is awarebut between the god and me there is no secret . We are not friends , and he knows it . Then I was led back through the pylons to the first courtyard , which had now been thrown open so that between its walls and as far as my eye could carry , to the very banks of the Nile itself , I could see my people , thousands upon thousands upon thousands of them , waiting to watch me go through once again , in public , the full traditional coronation ceremony that they had not seen since the crowning of my father , more than forty years ago . Now the great roar welled up to greet me in person . And now it suddenly all became real to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought forward to sit at my right hand , her chair a little back as became one soon to be , but not yet , Queen . Now I was to be united with my people in a bond of affection and love that nothing could break . The union with the god , restored with such desperate haste so that he might assert his claim on me as I was inducted into kingship , had been a cold , confusing and repellent ceremony to me . The taking of my crown again before my beloved people of my beloved Kemet was a  | thing so warm and marvelous that Ankhesenpaaten and I could only smile at one another in the wonderment and joy we shared in it . The first part of the day was ridiculousempty and horrid , as far as we were concerned . The second was love , in whose arms we have rested ever since , and upon whose endless kindness and unshakable loyalty we still hope to base our rule . I was seated on the ancient throne of coronation , so old that its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ priests danced and chanted in the bright sunshine , somehow no longer chill but soft and warm with the magic of love . The khepresh was removed , the Double Crown was placed upon my head . Priests masked as the spirits of the Nile twined the lily and the papyrus , representing the Two Lands , around a pillar to symbolize their union . I then rose and made my ceremonial run around a square marked out upon the sand : this ancient rite represented the way my distant ancestors millennia ago ran around the boundaries of our first capital of Memphis to symbolize their assumption of rule . There was more chanting , long and solemn , to which the vast crowd listened respectfully . Finally I returned to the throne , stepped forward and lifted my arms for silence . I was aware of consternation around me , sudden startled looks from my uncle Aye and Horemheb , Hatsuret 's uneasy turnings : this was not part of tradition . Akhenaten inaugurated it , this revolutionary direct contact with the people : they thought they had destroyed it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes , fear of what I might say , and I knew I must banish it at once . Indeed , I never intended else . " My dearly beloved people of Kemet ! " I cried , and my fluting child 's voice no doubt sounded thin and reedy in the utter silence ; but they loved me for it , and their love came up to me in waves . " Much of sadness and of ill has fallen upon us in recent years . Many were to blame " for I would not blame him , ever , who strove for love and died for it , though I could sense the silent protests around me because I did not " and all must now work together , to repair what has been done and make the Two Lands whole again . I will restore ma'at , I will bring back happiness . All will be again in Kemet as it was before . You and I , my dear people , together with our dear Queen , Ankhesenpaaten , will work to restore our beloved land . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! We will make all come right again for Kemet ! Great will be her glory hereafter , forever and ever , for millions of years ! " I , Neb-Kheperu-Ra " for a split second I hesitated , for the new name did not yet come easily to my tongue : then I decided it best to  | be clever and appear to accept " Tutankhamon " a joyful roar broke the silence to the very edge of the Nile , for they have never loved my brother 's Sole God of love , so I repeated it slowly " I , Neb-KheperuRa Tutankhamon , do so promise it ! " And turned back to resume my seat for the ceremonial games , to find my uncle , Horemheb and Hatsuret nodding and beaming with great relief and approval . They need not have worried : it was not at that moment I would choose to defy them , a child of nine only . How on earth could I ? There followed a procession through Thebes that lasted all afternoon , at which those who had been unable to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Ankhesenpaaten , borne high in our goldpainted baldachins , their exited , happy greetings . We then crossed the river to Malkata and attended the traditional ceremonial banquet for an hour or so , after which we were sent off to bed in charge of Ramesses and his wife Sitra , who are kindly people if a little dull . It was high time for us to leave , in fact , because by then nearly all the top officials of the Court , including even Horemheb ( though not my uncle Aye ) , were becoming very drunk , and other things were apparently soon to happen . On such occasions in Kemetincluding the banquets that traditionally follow funerals , and particularly at the great Festival of Opet , which has now been revived and lasts for two weeks while Amon is brought from Karnak to visit his temple at Luxorthe ladies wear cones of perfumed wax atop their wigs . As the wax melts , the perfumes run down over their bodies . This combines with a great deal of wine that everyone drinks , and presently things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life recorded on the walls of our tombs and temples . Ankhesenpaaten and I soon learned , in fact , that such occasions often conclude with most of the guests rutting like animals in a communal orgy which disgusts us so that we have banned it from our own banquets . But it goes on all over Kemet , all the time . Next day , of course , everyone is dignified again and serene as a temple painting , if a little hollow-eyed . We went to bed with the howls of our own guestsand from across the river the howls of the common citizens of Thebes , who always pour into the streets in a drunken mass on the slightest pretext to mimic their betters in every naked particularringing in our ears . With a wryness that came to me even at the age of nine , I reflected that the coronation of the King and Pharaoh Tutankhamon was indeed being suitably celebrated by his countrymen . When we said good night before being led to our respective chambers , Ankhesenpaaten and I agreed that this would never happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in spite of  | some grumbling by those who consider us strait-laced , that we have been able to achieve . After that I lingered for a few weeks in Thebes , while Aye and Horemheb gave orders to Amonhotep , Son of Hapu , and to Tuthmose , our chief sculptor , to start the rebuilding and redecorating of all the temples . I then made a triumphal coronation progress to Memphis , to Heliopolis , Hermonthis , and finally back to Hermopolis , across the river from Akhet-Aten ; and so from there back to this city that today we abandon . Here I have had one of my principal seats of government , though I have spent much time , too , in Memphis and in Thebes . Thebes in particular I like , because that is where I first became aware of life , in the Palace of Malkata ; and now that we are being forced to leave this city that holds so many unhappy memoriesand yet , for me and Ankhesenpaaten , as children growing up mostly in the palace of Nefertiti while my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thebes , many happy memories , tooit is to Thebes that I will go . I told my uncle recently that I wished to add to my titles the words Ruler of Southern ' No , ' " which means Thebes ; and there was happy agreement from all , because they thought it meant I wanted to be near Amon , whom I appear to love so much . Actually I want to reoccupy Malkata , which of all my palaces , save the North Palace here which we must now abandon , I like the best . Six months after returning here , Ankhesenpaaten and I were married in a lengthy ceremony , its first rites held in the House of the Aten , its second half held in the small temple of Amon adjoining what used to be my mother 's palace , now standing empty beside the Nile . Our desire to give the Aten such renewed prominence of course greatly disturbed Horemheb and Hatsuret , but to their surprise it was Aye who said firmly it should be so . It was he , in fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place . " We do not wish to destroy the Aten altogether , " he said to Horemheb when the two of them argued it out in my presence . " Why not ? " my cousin demanded bluntly . " Because Aten is still a sacred aspect of Ra , " Aye replied with equal bluntness . " And while we have restored Ra 's other aspects , and given back their power to Amon and the other gods , we can not simply pretend the Aten does not exist . The key to change in Kemet , my son , is gradual ' gradual . Even though he ( Aye does not name my brother if he can possibly avoid it . He does not go so far as to call him " the Heretic " or " the Criminal , " as Horemheb and many others do , but he will not say his name ) is gone , still for a time the Aten was supreme . The god can only be reduced gradually to a lesser role . "  | " Well , see that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncle came as close to open anger as I have ever seen him display with my powerful cousin , whom I think he even then was beginning to fear . " You do not order the Regent to do anything ! " he snapped . " I shall proceed in moderation and sense , as I have done all things . " " Including " Horemheb began sarcastically , but his father cut him off with a terrible fierceness . " Do not raise old ghosts with me ! There is guilt enough for all and blood enough for all ! Be satisfied with your portion , and be still ! " For quite a long time Horemheb stared at him , apparently unabashed , while I , frightened of their anger , almost hesitated to breathe . But Horemheb apparently was more intimidated than he showed , for presently he turned away with a sullen " Let us not do too much honor to the Aten , then ! " To which my uncle replied , more calmly , " We will not , you may rest assured of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concern by being as violent toward the Aten as he was toward Amon and the others . It is balance Kemet desperately needs now . Balance ! " Horemheb made no reply as he departed , and my uncle turned back to me , still breathing a little hard , to say quietly , " Son of the Sun , do not be alarmed by these arguments between your cousin and me . Though a mature man , he is still too rash and impatient in some respects . I know in his heart he sees my wisdom , as I hope you do too . Do you not agree with what I say ? " So dutifully I said ( because it conformed so well to my own desires , in any case ) , " Yes , Uncle . Your words make sense to me . " And thus we had our wedding , blessed at least in part by the Aten , as we wished ; and thus began the small defiancenever daring very much , for we are still so young and our hold on the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which has allowed us to keep our hearts at rest and feel that we are being true to those who watch us from the afterworld , expecting us to keep faith with them . It is for this reason also that , until this day , I have continued to use both my names , signing myself sometimes " Tutankhamon " and sometimes " Tutankhaten , " so that both appear on my official documents . Now I have been told that as of this day this will no longer be permitted : from now on all must be " Tutankhamon . " It will also be " Ankhesenamon " instead of Ankhesenpaaten . But they can not change what we call ourselves in our hearts , or what we call one another in the privacy of our chambers . Between ourselves , at least , we will continue to do what we feel to be our duty . On this day also , before we depart , I must set my seal " Tut-  | ankhamon " to the text of the " restoration stela " that Horemheb has drawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on two tablets , one in the temple of Karnak and the other in the temple of Luxor to provide , as he says , " a suitable celebration of your return to Thebes . " In them he wishes me to describe for eternity how I have restored to Amon and all the others their rights , prerogatives and privileges . He also wishes me to condemn my brother . This time my uncle and even my friend and cousin Nahkt-Min are agreed . I do not wish to do it , but these are the words I must endorse for them : " Now when His Majesty myself appeared as King , the temples from one end of the land to the other had fallen into ruin ; their shrines were desolate and had become wildernesses overgrown with weeds ; their sanctuaries were as though they had never been ; their precincts were trodden paths . The land was in confusion , for the gods had forsaken this land . If an army was sent to Asia to widen the frontiers of Kemet , it met with no success @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of him , he did not come . If one supplicated a goddess , likewise she did not come either . Their hearts were enfeebled because what had been made was destroyed . " I know that in large measure this is true ; yet I do not like the tone of criticism of my brother , who was kind to mehe was kind to me . He may have done bad things to Amon and the other gods , but did they not do bad things to him ? He did not turn upon them until very late , when he felt he could do no other . Is he to be blamed to eternity for that ? Apparently he is , for when I showed signs of demurring ( this was handed to me unexpectedly after dinner last night when I was of course entirely unprepared for it ) , I was threatened that if I did not sign we would not be allowed to return to Thebes , and there would be public disgrace for me . I am still too young , as I say , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said that , while I regretted what they seemed to regard as the necessity to attack a Good God ( they winced at that title , as I desired they should ) who could do them no further harm , still I could see that Amon perhaps needed to be appeased , now that they had made him so strong again . They did not like this reminder very much , but since I was conceding they could say no more about it . So with silent apologies to my brother I agreed to the rest of it as well . I related ( in Horemheb 's words  --  - he , being a scribe , is very good at words , of course ) how I was speaking from the domain of Tuthmose I ( life , health , prosperity ! ) at Akhet-Aten ( where my brother had built our distinguished ancestor a small honorary temple ) . I said I must congratulate myself on what I had accomplished for Amon and the other  | gods so far , and stated my determination to put an end to evil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " momuments of eternity . " I also promised to build Amon " an august image of pure gold " inlaid with lapis lazuli and other precious stones , greater than he had ever receivedit would take thirteen stretchers to carry it , in fact , which I reflected silently ought to be enough to make Hatsuret dance up and down the obelisk of Hatshepsut ( life , health , prosperity ! ) in sheer glee . I also related how I had " gathered in priests and prophets , children of the notables of their towns , each the son of an eminent man whose name is known , " to form the revived priesthood of Amon ( all of them carefully selected by Aye and Horemheb , of course , even though officially appointed by me ) and told how I had endowed the temple at Karnak with treasures and filled its warehouses with male and female slaves to wait upon them . I also described how I intended to rebuild Amon 's barges with cedarwood of the finest quality and gild them with gold so that they might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for them male and female workers and singers to assist them in their taskall this for the delight of all the gods and goddesses , who loved me and were filled with delight by my care for them ( as indeed they should be , for it is all being handed back to them on a golden platter ) . For this , I concluded , the gods had already repaid me a hundredfold , particularly kindly old Amon , who now " loves better than ever his son Neb-Kheperu-Ra , Lord of Karnak , Tutankhamon , him who satisfies all the gods . " To this I affixed my seal " Tutankhamon " but not before I asked my cousin Horemheb , " Is this how you would achieve balance between Amon and Aten , Cousin ? To me it seems you would put Amon again on top of the world . " " It is not so , Son of the Sun , " he said , rather more vehemently than I think he intended . " It is simply a matter of redressing the wrongs that have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not lift him too high , " I said , " for he has been known to cast down even Pharaohs whom he does not like . " He gave me a startled look , flushed and growled , " Well , it will be done correctly . Do not worry , Majesty . He will not cast you down , for he loves youas you , " he added , suddenly peering at me , sharp and shrewd , " love him . Is it not so , Son of the Sun ? " " It is so , Cousin , " I said calmly , " with all my heart . Does not everything you require me to do give proof of it ? " " I require of you nothing you do not grant willingly out of your deep love for the god ! " he said . " Is that not also true , Son of the Sun ? "  | I saw from his expression , and my uncle 's that it had better be , so I laughed and said , " Certainly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Never would I have it otherwise ! " " I hope not , " he said , while at his shoulder my uncle looked as intent as he , " for to do so would only bring new sorrows upon the Two Lands . And that we all wish to avoid , do we not ? " " You have the proof of it , " I said cheerfully . " My seal is affixed to your writing . You hold it in your hand . Certainly even for one as suspicious as you , Cousin , that should be sufficient . " " He is not suspicious , " my uncle said gravely , seeking to turn aside the contest he sensed beneath our words . " He is simply careful of the kingdom . " " And I am not ? " I demanded , suddenly stern , drawing myself up to my full height , which of course is not yet full-grown : but impressive enough , I guess , for they both stepped back a little as though from a physical impact , at my regal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not ? " " No , Majesty , " Aye said hastily ; and , " No , Son of the Sun , " echoed Horemheb with equal haste . And , " Very well , then , " said I. " Take your paper and have your stelae carved . I , Neb-Kheperu-Ra Tutankhamon , have agreed to it , so let no more be said ! " " Yes , Majesty , " they said as one ; bowed low ; and backed out while I still stood stern and imperious before them . Behind me I heard a giggle : Ankhesenpaaten had been peeking through a slit in the curtain that conceals my private passageway to the throne . " You have them scared , " she said , coming out and taking my hand in hers . " Not really , " I said . " I am scared of them , and so should you be , until we are powerful enough to bend them to our rule . " " Yes , " she agreed , suddenly somber , for we agree in all things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet . " " Not yet , " I said , " but it will come . " " Yes , " she said softly , kissing me as she often does , for we have found great happiness and are very close now that I am old enough , " it will come . " Her eyes looked suddenly fierce . " I swear it by the blood of my mother and my father ! " " I swear it by the blood of my brother and my cousin ! " I said with equal fierceness : and then we clung to one another very tightly for a very long time , for in reality we are still children and today we are being forced to leave our favorite city under the command of others , and we are , in truth , unable to do the slightest thing about it . But the time will come , it is simply a matter of getting through these next few years without antagonizing them too much or revealing to  | them too clearly what our real thoughts are . For the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using the " restoration stela " as my excuse , which I think I can do in the guise of maintaining that " balance " my uncle talks about . I will tell them about this when we get to Thebes . If they protest too much I shall abandon itfor now . If they do not I shall go ahead , regarding it as one more small step on the long road we must go to return Kemet to the only balance that can truly restore her glory , the balance of love . Now the trumpets are blowing , there is bustle in the corridors . They are coming to get us . It is time to say good-by to Akhet-Aten . We stand together for a last moment at the window , arms about each other 's waists , eyes suddenly filled with tears as we look our last upon the ghost city to which we will never , in all probability , return . They are with us achingly now , our own special ghosts . One shuffles awkwardly down the hall . One gives us a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and harried by her cares for Kemet , looks at us absentmindedly yet with love as she vanishes from us down an empty street . We have not left you , dear ghosts . By us you will be remembered and revenged . I , Neb-Kheperu-Ra Tutankhaten , so decree it . You will remember me , Amon-em-het the peasant who lives beside the Nile and watches the grand ones pass up and down on their way to death and disaster ? Well , I am still here , a little older now : and lots of them are not . So I guess I ca n't complain , even though life has never been easy for us here in the village , and I have just about given up hope that it ever will be . Tonight the village is being greatly honored , so we are told , because the procession of the new Good God , our boy-King Tutankhamon , has graciously decided to tie up along our shores on its way to Thebes . What this " honor " means in fact is that hundreds of oarsmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to chase our women and children and buy up every bit of food we haveor steal it , if they ca n't buy it . When I first heard they were cominghorsemen rode ahead to  | spread the word , followed by the sound of many trumpets on the river , far offI ordered my wife and our six children ( yes , we keep at it , though it means more mouths to feedbut also , you see , more hands to feed my wife and me when our mouths grow toothless again , as theirs first were ) to take away our precious little hoard of grain , our two cattle , our two donkeys , even our dog and the catand hide them several miles from here in a secret cave we know at the place where the Black Land ends like a knife edge and the Red Land begins . I told them to remain there , for evil visitors sometimes want more than food , and my wife is still comely and we have three girls , and poor peasants have little appeal from the whims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left our hut wide open , the rough stone table and benches where we eat and the round stone where we grind the grain left in place , our sleeping pallets stacked in one corner of the room , our earthen pots and pans in another . I hoped this would discourage any would-be evildoer off the boats who might happen to look in , and with a silent prayer to Amon that all would be well with my family and our house , I went forth into the village to learn what I could learn . The thing I learned , to my pleased surprise , was that this visit was different from the last such one we had , when the Good God 's father , Amonhotep III ( life , health , prosperity , and may his memory be blessed forever , good father to us that he was ! ) decided to tie up here many years ago on his way to Memphis . That time it did go just as I said . I was but a boy at the time , and even I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of everything we had , there were screams and scuffles in the bushes , many of us children learned things that night we had not known before . The great ones passed through like a plague of locusts and we cursed their memory ( except for the Good God , who remained on his golden barge and could not have known what went on ) for many years thereafter . It was this that made us all rush our goods and families away at sundown when we heard the new Pharaoh was coming . And for a little while , as I entered the market square and greeted my friends with worried glancesall of us standing about uncertainly , trembling and fearful of what might happen as the noisy visitors approachedit seemed the old pattern would be repeated . And it seemed that it would be approved by Pharaoh and by Amon himself , for it was one who announced himself as Amon 's High Priest who strode first into the square , stabbed the pole of his flaring torch into the sand with a scornful authority , and cried out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the comfort and well-being of Pharaoh , who blesses your humble village with his sacred presence this
