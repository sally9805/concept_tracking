" In my articles I always wanted to help Yugoslavia . I am simply fighting for the rights set out in the constitution . " So pleaded Mihajlo Mihajlov last week as he stood before five stern-faced jud es in a courtroom at Novi Sad , about 75 miles northwest of Belgrade . For the 40-year-old dissident author , who was arrested last October , that fight involves denouncing his country 's one-party system-even at his own trial . To no one 's surprise , the justices , all of whom are members of the League of Yugoslav Communists , ignored his arguments and found him guilty of disseminating hostile propaganda against Yugoslavia and of associating with foreign emigre groups . His sentence : seven years imprisonment . <P> The ostensible reason for Mihajlov 's trial was the publication , since 1971 , of four of his articles by Posev , a stridently anti-Moscow Russian-language journal published in Frankfurt by Soviet migrs . All the articles had earlier appeared in Western journals , including the New York Times and the New Leader . In an essay on Russian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " really endangers the dictatorship of the Soviet Communist Party . " In another work , he accused Yugoslav President Josip Broz Tito of permitting a " cult of personality " and denounced the Yugoslav " party oligarchy " for attempting " to reintroduce total dictatorship in all vital spheres . " <P> Moscow 's Least Favorite . If these articles were so offensive to Belgrade , asked Yugoslavia 's Archheretic Milovan Djilas in a newspaper article last fall , why was Mihajlov not indicted when they first appeared ? Answering his own question , Djilas notes that three years ago , the . historian 's statements did not seem so threatening to the regime as they do now that " Yugoslavia 's ideological and political course has changed . " Tito , who will be 83 in May , has grown increasingly worried about his nation 's ability to remain united and independent after his death . Thus he has recently ordered an ideological campaign to suppress political unorthodoxy and augment the power of the central party leadership . According to Djilas , Mihajlov " did not fall in line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also be a sop to the Soviets , whose attitude toward Yugoslavia will be extremely important in the post-Tito era ( TIME , Oct. 21 ) . For a decade , Mihajlov has been the Kremlin 's least favorite Yugoslav . His 1965 travelogue , Moscow Summer , was scathingly critical of the Soviet police state . Kremlin leaders were so angered by it that they pressured Belgrade to prosecute Mihajlov for " defaming a friendly power . " Since then he has been tried three times and has served 3 years in prison . This did not dissuade him , however , from warning in his recent articles that the greatest danger to Yugoslavia comes not from the West but from the East . <P> Even before his detention last fall , Mihajlov was living in a prison of sorts . The government refused to let him publish , and he was prevented from leaving the country to accept lecturing positions at Western universities . Now Mihajlov hopes that Western outrage at his imprisonment will induce Belgrade to reduce his sentence or permit him to emigrate .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
