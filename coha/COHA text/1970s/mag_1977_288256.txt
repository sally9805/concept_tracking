A young killer-an d television-go on trial for murder On June 4 Elinor Haggart , 82 , a Miami Beach widow , discovered two teen-agers burglarizing her home . It was a fatal incident : the intruders abruptly shot the old woman to death with a gun they had found in the house , grabbed $415 in cash and made their getaway in the victim 's 1972 Buick . Four days later Ronald Zamora , 15 , confessed to police that he had killed Mrs. Haggart , who also happened to be his next-door neighbor . This week Zamora is facing a Miami jury-his accomplice will be tried separately - charged with first-degree murder , burglary , robbery and possession of a firearm while committing a felony . <P> Another desperate young drug addict plundering to maintain his habit ?

His favorite shows : such cops-and-robbers series as Kojak , Baretta and Starsky and Hutch . According to Mrs. Zamora , Ronald is such a Kojak fan , " he even asked his father to shave his head because he wanted my husband to look like him .
