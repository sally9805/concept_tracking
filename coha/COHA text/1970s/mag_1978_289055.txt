Should a paper put its money where its mouth is ? <P> Southern Florida 's Gold Coast , a narrow strip of sun-drenched sand and aging hotels that stretches north from Miami Beach , has fallen on bad times : the beaches have been slipping into the Atlantic and the tourists are slipping north to Disney World and south to Caribbean casinos . So some of the area 's businessmen have been pressing hard for the legalization of casino gambling , a matter voters will decide in a Nov. 7 referendum . <P> The measure is opposed by Governor Reubin Askew , clergymen , parimutuel operators-and many of the state 's leading newspapers . But instead of merely editorializing against the threat of corruption and organized crime , the papers have become major contributors of money to the antigambling efforts . Their role raises thorny questions of ethics and propriety . <P> According to campaign spending reports filed late last month , Florida news organizations have paid or pledged some $175,000 to No Casinos Inc. , the principal antigambling lobby . Big spenders included the St. Petersburg Times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( Orlando Sentinel Star , Fort Lauderdale News ) , the Cox Newspapers ( Miami News , Palm Beach Post and Times ) , the Tampa Tribune and Wometco Enterprises ( Miami 's WTVJ-TV-each of which gave $25,000 . The Knight-Ridder chain 's Miami Herald , largest paper in the state , gave $10,000 . <P> The newspapers have no immediate financial interest in opposing casino gambling . Indeed , papers around the Gold Coast would probably gain from any casino-induced economic revival . So why did the publishers ante up ? " We want to participate on the local level with other Florida businesses that see the serious social and economic dangers of casino gambling , " says Miami Herald President Alvah Chapman Jr. , who was designated by Governor Askew to be a chief fund raiser for the fight . Says Orlando Sentinel Star Editor James Squires , " This just happens to be a case of a newspaper putting its money where its mouth is for once . " <P> So far , the contributions do not appear to have affected news coverage of the casino gambling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their financial stake until forced to by last month 's disclosure of campaign spending . Still , the Gannett Co. ' s four Florida dailies declined to contribute , despite a personal appeal from Askew to chain President Allen Neuharth . The Miami News last week printed a letter from 47 employees objecting to the paper 's contribution . " Nobody is censoring our copy , " says Miami Herald Reporter Pat Riordan , " but this whole thing raises the appearance of a conflict of interest . " <P> Perhaps more troublesome is an attempt by pro-gambling forces to make the financial role of the press a major issue . Spokesman Sanford Weiner has questioned the objectivity of contributing news organizations , and has charged that a number of Florida television stations have refused pro-casino ads . ( Though broadcasters are required by law to air opposing sides of a " controversial " public issue , the Federal Communications Commission has rarely forced stations to accept " controversial " advertising. )                    @
