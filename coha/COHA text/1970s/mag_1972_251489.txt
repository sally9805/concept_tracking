patriarch : the head of a family <P> First and foremost , he was head of the family . It was a large family - Russians , Greeks , Bulgars , Syrians - and it could be a quarrelsome one . His fellow patriarchs in the ancient sees of Jerusalem , Antioch and Alexandria , and newer ones like Moscow , recognized him only as the " first among equals . " The power of his office had originally derived from its association with the Byzantine Empire , and later from its role as a kind of Christian viceroy for the Islamic Ottoman Empire . But modern Turkey had scant use for a Christian leader in Constantinople . <P> Thus , while as many as 250 million Eastern Orthodox Christians round the world owed him spiritual respect , His Holiness Athenagoras I , Archbishop of Constantinople-New Rome and Ecumenical Patriarch , held actual jurisdiction over as few as 3,000,000 of them , mostly Greek Orthodox outside of Greece . Yet when he died at 86 last week in Istanbul - of kidney failure following a hip fracture - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great holy men . <P> His gift had been one of reconciliation . It was Athenagoras who first sent out feelers to the Vatican to end the 900-year-old battle between Roman Catholicism and Orthodoxy. *The gesture culminated in the historic meeting between Pope Paul VI and Athenagoras in 1964 on Jerusalem 's sacred Mount of Olives , where the two men exchanged a kiss of peace and prayed together . The next year , the Patriarch and the Pope officially revoked the mutual anathemas that had been hurled at the start of the schism between East and West in 1054 . In 1967 they capped the new era of good feeling by exchanging visits at Istanbul and Rome . <P> <P> A doctor 's son , Athenagoras was born Aristocles Spyrou in 1886 in what is now northwestern Greece . He trained for the priesthood at the Patriarchate 's seminary on the island of Halki near Istanbul . By 1922 he was a bishop-bearing the ecclesiastical name Athenagoras - and soon became one of the leading clerics in Greece . Perhaps partly to remove him from contention for the powerful post of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1931 as Archbishop of the Greek Orthodox Church of North and South America . <P> U.S. Greek Orthodoxy was in a shambles when Athenagoras arrived . Like other immigrant churches , it was torn by the politics of the old country , and Greece had been riven for decades by the struggle between royalists and republicans . In 1922 the new Ecumenical Patriarch , Meletios Metaxakis , had canonically severed the American church from Athenian authority and made it subject to the Patriarch of Constantinople . Despite the disjuncture , political passions continued to divide parishes .
