THE CAR THIEF <P> by THEODORE WEESNER <P> 370 pages . Random House . $6.95 . <P> <P> Alex Housman steals cars . At 16 , already in trouble because he has rifled high school gym lockers and lifted a wad of bills from the wallets there , he is off in a coppertone Buick Riviera - his 14th car- " joyriding " with a tense joylessness through his slushy Michigan factory town , watching for cops , indulging his quick-fade fantasies of ownership and manhood . <P> He is caught . With a cavalier imprudence he has given the camel 's hair coat in the back seat to a girl he hardly knows , and the girl 's mother calls the police . He goes to a youth detention house , does a few months ' time , then returns to Central High School , where he is brutally beaten by his schoolmates for that locker-room job . He drops out of school , drifts , eventually joins the Army . <P> It is , in outline , an unprepossessing story-a punk 's progress . In this first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excessively precise . Yet the book develops a building power . It is , for one thing , an achievement of almost perfect sympathy . One begins caring about Alex-his guilt , his daydreams , his bewildered adolescent innocence . Descendants of Huckleberry Finn , Alex and his brother do cannonball dives into the polluted muck of an urban river , cracking exuberant and forlorn scatological jokes about what they are swimming in . <P> In Alex 's swift fantasies of being a basketball star , in his coach 's small complacent cruelties that drive Alex to quit , an American dream of winning goes winkling out . The thoroughfares of escape-rivers , highways-are encrusted , blocked arteries on the landscape . <P> Alex 's father , alcoholic , grimy with grease , possesses only a vocabulary of manly cliches . The father works in the local Chevrolet plant , making the bright cars that his son will steal . Yet between him and his boy , Weesner draws an evasive tenderness , a shared vulnerability and hence a curious kind of dignity . <P> For Alex , the cars sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are an obsession , a brief freedom and , simultaneously , a vehicle for the half wish of getting caught . Only the cars seem to renew themselves , with new models every year .
