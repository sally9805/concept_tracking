ROOSTER COGBURN <P> Directed by STUART MILLAR Screenplay by MARTIN JULIEN <P> The announcement last year that John Wayne and Katharine Hepburn were to be teamed in a movie for the first time in their long careers was the sort of thing that fills fans with an unsettling mixture of hope and dread . The hope arose out of the possibilities inherent in permitting these feisty senior citizens to have at one another on the screen . The dread derived from knowledge that they would be doing a mere sequel ( to True Grit ) and that producers have a habit of resting on their packages , not bothering to turn them into movies that would interest us on their own merits . Rooster Cogburn is not as bad as it might have been . It is just not as good as it quite easily could have been . Hepburn is doing her doughty spinster turn , than which there is none finer , and Wayne is doing his crotchety old reprobate number , than which ditto . They meet after an outlaw gang he is pursuing pauses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murder her father , a missionary to an Indian village . Nothing will do , of course , but that she must join forces with Rooster in order to help avenge her father 's death . The pair quarrel along a meandering trail . She tries to reform him or at least get him to take a bath and ease up on the corn likker . He grouses about the talky ways into which her moral fervor leads her . In the end , needless to say , mutual respect bordering on romantic attachment develops between them . <P> The film 's central , bickersome relationship is satisfyingly close to what one expects of Wayne and Hepburn . The tremulous self-awareness that has marred some of her recent performances is entirely absent here , and she is the tough-minded , high-spirited Kate of blessed memory . And the Duke , too , is his old self-the slackness engendered by a succession of dismal late films banished . In short , they are good for each other and fun to watch . <P> This is a considerable triumph , for the script @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line is but minimally suspenseful and the dialogue generally banal . Director Millar has a nice feel for his handsome Oregon locations but none at all for staging action . His tendency is to back away from it and to minimize it so that even a climactic ride down a white-water river on a raft load ed with nitroglycerin turns out to be dull . <P> Still there they are , in what may be a once-in-a-lifetime pairing . If no one appears much interested in helping them to be their very best , it can be said that no one gets in their way either . That should be reason enough for older view ers to take a flyer on Rooster . And rea son enough to take the kids along , if you were planning a trip to Mount Rushmore.
