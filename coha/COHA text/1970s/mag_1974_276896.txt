The pervasive economic malaise is certainly democratic in its sweep . Almost everybody-whether affluent or poor , young or old , urban or rural , white , black or brown-rightly feels a little or a lot less well off than several years ago . Some examples : <P> BELEAGUERED BOUTIQUE . When Barbara Edlund opened her bath-accessories boutique The Royal Flush on San Francisco 's Union Street 16 months ago , a two-roll package of campy printed toilet paper sold for $1.25 . Today the same package sells for $2-a price that Mrs. Edlund concedes is " ridiculous . " She is merely passing along to customers astronomical wholesale price increases on a wide variety of items ; for example , an importer of bamboo magazine racks has recently doubled the price to $8 . The prices are discouraging many potential buyers and Mrs. Edlund has fired her only salesgirl . Though her husband , a lawyer , " suggests every morning that I sell the store , " she has no plans for throwing in the towel . " People say that if you leave your heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she says wistfully . " Maybe they leave their hearts , but not cold cash . " <P> CRUMBLING COOKIE BAKER . A year ago , Baker Louis Calabrese , 45 , of Carnegie , Pa. , had plenty of competitors in the business of baking cookie-like miniature waffles that are known as pizzeles . Now he thinks that he has a monopoly . All of his rivals , he believes , have been shut down by the vicious cost squeeze that threatens to close Calabrese 's Caroline Baking Co. ( 1973 sales , $200,000 ) . In the past eight months , oil of anise has risen from $3 per lb. to $40 . Because the high price of chickenfeed is forcing many farmers to slaughter their hens , eggs are both scarce and more expensive . Says he : " If prices keep rising like this I could go out of business in a few months . " Calabrese has reduced the number of pizzelles in a package from seven to six , foregoing a price increase because " I had to raise the price from 33 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ INSECURITY . David Seidman , 68 , once looked forward to a comfortable retirement . He had worked 20 years as a cloth cutter in Los Angeles , earning $160 a week when he left and had invested $8,000 in a savings and loan . But inflation has robbed Seidman of his dreams . " I am now living on social insecurity and a little interest from my savings , " he says bitterly . " If I had not had that I would have died . " <P> A rent increase from $84 to $92 on Seidman 's one-room apartment in sunny but seedy East Hollywood almost totally negated the latest increase in his $230-a-month Social Security check . Climbing costs have purged cottage cheese from his meatless diet ( he suffers from a cardiovascular disorder and subsists on nuts , grains , fruits and beans ) . Despite Medicare , Seidman has had to dip into his savings to cover medical bills . He recently paid $700 for dental work and $140 for a pair of special orthopedic shoes , and fears that he will have to make another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later this year . " I 'm mad about inflation , " says Seid man , " and I know I must fight back . " He has joined an organization called Fight Inflation Together , which has sponsored boycotts of meat and milk and picketed super markets to protest high prices .
