Like characters in a novel by Allen ( Advise and Consent ) Drury , two of the Nixon Administration 's most powerful figures are grabbing for the sweeping economic policymaking authority once wielded by departing Treasury Secretary George Shultz . The contenders are Roy Ash , 55 , once president of Litton Industries , now director of the Office of Management and Budget , and William E. Simon , 46 , a former Wall Street bond trader , now federal energy czar . Simon is on the verge of winning an early round : President Nixon this week is expected to name him to succeed Shultz at Treasury , a job that apparently Ash wanted . But neither man is likely to get Shultz 's other titles of Economic Counsellor and chairman of the Council on Economic Policy . In a continuing move away from super Cabinet posts , the White House will probably leave those jobs vacant . So Simon and Ash are almost sure to carry on for several more months a backstairs guerrilla war for top policymaking authority . <P> Complete Surprise . While the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coordinate economic policy is falling into disarray . Since Shultz announced that he will leave in May , key officials have strayed from the Administration 's economic line or even collided with it head on . Cost of Living Council Chief John Dunlop , for example , once indicated willingness to accept stand-by authority to reimpose across-the-board wage-price controls . Though Congress is moving instead to kill controls altogether ( see following story ) , Dunlop 's stand briefly upset other Administration planners , including Shultz , who want controls to die . One Government economist grumbles : " Dunlop would never have done what he has been doing before Shultz announced he was leaving . " <P> Another symptom of the void at the top was Agriculture Secretary Earl Butz 's unilateral decision two weeks ago to buy $45 million worth of beef for the Government 's school-lunch program , in an attempt to prop up beef prices . Butz 's decision came as a complete surprise to the COLC 'S food policy committee , which is chaired by Shultz , and provoked an angry reaction from Dunlop , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with undisguised pleasure . <P> The disorganization is unlikely to end until the Simon-Ash struggle produces a clear winner . In classic Washington fashion , that struggle is being fought almost entirely behind the scenes . Tension between the two men has flared openly only once , in February , when <P> Ash made an optimistic statement about the energy crisis . Simon , on television , smilingly warned Ash to " keep his cotton-pickin ' hands off energy policy . " Next day Ash retorted : " We do n't pick cotton at OMB . We run the plantation . " <P> Since then there has been no public bickering between the two , but both have been vigorously campaigning to line up support from the President and his key aides . Two weeks ago Ash flew to the Florida White House for a weekend discussion with Nixon about the future of economic policymaking machinery-and presumably his desire to play a larger role in it . Simon then closeted himself with White House Chief of Staff Alexander Haig , who is apparently in Simon 's corner .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
