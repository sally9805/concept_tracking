txt The word on Northern Ireland here in London is still " urgency . " But , equally , there is caution signaled against trying too early or too precisely to second-guess British Prime Minister Edward Heath on any political , social , or economic initiatives he might be considering . In the six Northern Ireland counties themselves , " D " ( for disruption ) day proceeded Wednesday without overt violence . But some roads were blocked , some police stations picketed , and phone lines were occasionally clogged . A Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association ( NICRA ) spokesman said : " Our aim is to show that a considerable section of the people is sick and tired of the present policies of Stormont . " ( Stormont is the seat of provincial government and Parliament near Belfast . ) Schoolchildren marched Security forces had braced themselves for possible mass demonstrations . But as the working day drew to a close , none had taken place apart from a march of some 500 schoolchildren in one section of Belfast . About the most dramatic demonstration of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposition members of the provincial Parliament , led by legislator John Hume , look up station in the Bogside in Londonderry  --  where 13 demonstrators fell to British Army gunfire on Jan. 30  --  and began a 24-hour anti-internment fast . On the eve of the day of disruption , the provincial Premier of Ulster , Brian Faulkner , made one of his toughest speeches in weeks proclaiming that Ulster would " never surrender our destiny into the hands of the gunman or those who seek to profit from his activities . " He even accepted a motion by a protestant hard-liner , the Rev. Ian Paisley that the Ulster Government oppose any moves toward uniting Ireland . " The Unionist Party , " Mr. Faulkner said , opposes any incorporation of Northern Ireland in an all-Ireland Republic . From this we have never wavered and we never will .

" " What we see of the Irish Republic we do not like , " he said . Mr. Faulkner has no choice , of course , but to talk this way if he is to keep grip on the Ulster majority  --  the one million Protestants , predominantly Unionist . This is no time ? as he sees it  --  for the Protestant majority to get the impression of wavering in regard to their constitutional position . Mr. Heath will have enough automatic resistance as it is from hard-liners like the Rev. Mr. Paisley and others for initiatives or concessions of any sort . New approaches hinted New propositions to resolve the crisis  --  and there can be no doubt whatever any more that they are in the works here ? will have to touch the heart of Ulster life : its community relationships , its faltering economics , its exclusively Unionist management of government . Mr. Heath and his relevant Cabinet ministers met Wednesday to work out details of substance and timing . Despite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not likely within the next few days . Early next week seems the likely moment for action . But there is no dawdling in government here even though some Cabinet disagreement apparently remains as to whether this really is the best possible moment for an orches tration of British-Ulster action on Northern Ireland to set alongside the security campaign of the British Army on duty there . Debate in Cabinet There appears to be some debate in the Cabinet over whether action on Ulster should be routed through long-sought interparty talks or more promptly , and directly , straight from the shoulder of the govern-ment , The overriding question continues to be time and timing . Mr. Faulkner appears to be holding violence-weary Protestants in line . The CRA appears to have made a deal with the outlawed Irish Republican Army 's band of terrorists to permit nonviolent mass protest to occupy center-stage momentarily in the minority 's campaign to overthrow the status quo in Ulster . Prime attention therefore  --  with some tense breath-holding  --  focuses on London and Mr. Heath , whose most fundamental tenet of government is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
