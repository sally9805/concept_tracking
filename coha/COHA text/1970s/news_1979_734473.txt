txt Spurred by a projected increase in demand for coal by electric utilities , a Florida firm has proposed construction of a coal slurry pipeline from the Midwest to Georgia and Florida . If some formidable legislative hurdles can be cleared , and assuming that there are no major stumbling blocks to receiving state and local construction permits , it is estimated that the $2 billion to $3 billion project could be built and operating by 1986 . A leading location for the starting point is the southern Illinois-southern Indiana area . One scenario places it in the general vicinity of Mount Vernon , Illinois , near of St. Louis . Such a pipeline could save utility custom- ers in the Florida/Georgia area $15 billion over a 20-year period in reduced fuel costs , says Wiley Cauthen , senior engineer for the sponsor of the project , Continental Resources Company , an energy exploration and transportation firm based in Winter Park , Florida . Industry sources expect the demand for coal in the two Southeastern states to reach 55 million tons a year by the late 1980s , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are planning to switch to coal ( or a coal-oil combination ) or to build new coal-fired generating facilities . Among these are Florida Power &; Light Company , Georgia Power Company , and Tampa Electric Company . The US Environmental Protection Agency requires the installation of scrubbers on all new power plants using coal . Sources say this will enable the new Southeastern plants to burn the less-expensive , high-sulfur coal found in Illinois and other parts of the Midwest and East . It has not escaped the notice of pipeline proponents and Illinois officials alike that several Georgia and Florida utilities are interested in Illinois coal ? if it can be moved by a slurry pipeline . Mr. Cauthen says a recent feasibility study by the Bechtel Corporation , a major engineering and construction firm , examined " four supply scenarios for the Georgia and Florida markets . All four are economically feasible and all involve the Illinois Basin either wholly or partially . " With what appears to be adequate economic justification for the project ( as well as meeting the Carter administration 's call for the increased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their biggest hurdle involves land acquisition . Coal slurry pipeline companies do not have the right to condemn land through eminent-domain proceedings as do railroads , utilities ( for their transmission lines ) , gas pipelines , and municipalities ( for water and sewer lines ) . Supporters of the project say the inability to exercise the right of eminent domain effectively blocks slurry pipeline construction . // From page 1 Pumping coal : new energy muscle for US They say the railroads , which vehemently oppose slurry pipelines , consistently have refused to allow such lines to cross their rights of way . This means that slurry lines must try to make an " end run " around land owned by the railroads ? which greatly increases costs and lengthens construction timetables . In an effort to resolve the issue to their satisfaction , slurry pipeline operators have gone to state legislatures and to Congress for legislation giving them eminent domain rights . So far , Florida is the only state along the route of the proposed line which has enacted such legislation . But sources say pressure from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take effect only after all other states along the proposed route have passed similar legislation . At the national level , a bill is pending before the House of Representatives which would allow " pipeline operators to exercise eminent domain under carefully constructed circumstances , " says Chuck Linderman , a spokesman for the Slurry Transport Association . The bill is said to have the backing of major utilities , coal operators , and the Carter administration . But , as in Florida , the railroads are putting up stiff opposition . We 're opposed to eminent domain at the federal level , " says Dan lang , general manager of the Association of American Railroads . " We believe we would lose a substantial amound of very profitable traffic to coal slurry pipelines . " Currently , he estimates , railroads are hauling about two-thirds of the nation 's coal . Replies Mr. Cauthen : " A coal slurry pipeline is not a panacea . About 80 percent of the projected coal growth in the project 's market area will go to the railroads and water transportation . We feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next 10 years if the eminent domain legislation is passed . "
