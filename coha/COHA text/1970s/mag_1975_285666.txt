No modern Pope has tried more earnestly than Paul VI to control the proudly independent Society of Jesus . When the policymaking General Congregation of 235 Jesuits from 80 countries convened three months ago in Rome , Pope Paul made known that he wanted no changes made regarding the " fourth vow " of special loyalty to the Pope , which some Jesuits take in addition to the three usual vows of poverty , chastity and obedience . His reasoning : to extend the elitist vow to all Jesuit priests ( fewer than 50% are now allowed to take it ) would weaken it as a commitment . Undaunted , the Congregation , by more than a two-thirds majority , agreed in a preliminary vote to extend the vow to all Jesuit priests ( TIME , Feb 10 ) . The Pope responded militantly . In a letter to Jesuit Superior General Pedro Arrupe , he not only vetoed the fourth-vow action , but insisted on his right to approve every document from the Congregation-despite a longstanding custom that Popes review only major constitutional changes . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was held last month in Paul 's private library . While Arrupe 's first assistant waited in an anteroom , the Superior General entered the library to find seated with the Pontiff Archbishop Giovanni Benelli , the No. 2 man at the Secretariat of State , where hostility to the Jesuits often runs high . The Pope was warm but firm . Arrupe 's responsibility , he insisted , was to reimpose discipline and respect for tradition and persuade the increasingly egalitarian Jesuits not to change the structure of their order . Paul 's message to the Jesuits : enough innovation is enough . <P> Most Controversial . The Jesuit fathers , according to one , were left " reeling " and " crestfallen " by the papal attitude , but nevertheless completed work on a dozen documents last week . The most controversial of these , TIME learned , was called " Faith and Justice . " It asserts that Jesuits must attack poverty and injustice even if that means in some cases struggling against oppressive governments . Life within the order would be changed by another much debated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vow of poverty . Funds earmarked for Jesuit schools and institutions would be kept separate from those of the Jesuits ' own living communities . Other legislation would streamline candidates ' training . <P> Because of the papal review that had to take place , the Jesuits were not sure that their documents would be accepted . There were even rumors that Arrupe might resign if the documents were vetoed . Then , in the final hours of the General Congregation last week , Pope Paul sought to reassure the Jesuits . He summoned Arrupe and his four top assistants to a special meeting . The mood was noticeably different from that of the earlier meeting . The Pontiff explained that " it was this very affection that we have for you that drove us to interpose our authority in the course of recent events . " After presenting the Jesuits with a valuable crucifix , he announced that he had approved the four documents he had received so far from the Congregation - including one that could provide a back-door way for more men to take the fourth vow .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
