Doleful G.O.P. <P> To the Editors : <P> The Ford-Dole presidential ticket Aug. 30 will be tough . Democrats should return to their battle stations . And Jimmy Carter should not ship his furniture or appoint his Cabinet yet . <P> Thomas B. Givens Renton , Wash . <P> My moderate instincts warn me against Dole 's smart-alecky shallowness as he stalks arrogantly along . There is something of the Nixon-Agnew flavor here . I wonder uneasily how distressing it would be should this glib practitioner , by some unfortunate circumstance , become President . <P> Henry E. Biggs Front Royal , Va . <P> Robert Dole is a man of intelligence , humor and wit . It is pleasing news to me that a candidate can open himself emotionally to the public and that our leaders are n't mechanical robots . <P> Laurel Wurth Briarwood , N. Y. <P> How come Dole can cry but Muskie ca n't ? <P> Charlotte Minnette Evansville , Ind . <P> I would buy a used car from Ford . I would not buy a used car from Dole . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might buy a used car from Mondale . <P> Irene Streeter McLean Devils Lake , N. Dak . <P> Republican Vice-Presidential Candidate Robert Dole 's homecoming introduction of President Ford as a " man I consider to be a friend of rural America , a friend of small-town America " was appropriate rhetoric , given the time and place . <P> Unfortunately , it is not rural America or small-town America that desperately needs friends , but our overcrowded , problem-beset cities . <P> Gene Paul Yarnell , Editor Community Advocate Detroit <P> Betty Ford 's crude , unwarranted remarks about Nancy Reagan typify the mindless , permissive drivel we have come to expect from that dancer turned counterculture apologist and defender of public immorality . <P> Curt Smith Clinton , N. Y. <P> My choice is so close , yet not running . It is Betty Ford , a wonderful and amazing woman . <P> Jean Louise Fiftal Cheshire , Conn . <P> How ironic that the G.O.P. strategy is to " Give ' em hell . " The Republicans did enough of that with Watergate . <P> Diane Bright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the popularity contest to the Democrats because " sharing the wealth " is a much more salable term than an abstract word like freedom . <P> Timothy P. Utter Hopkins , Minn . <P> Bring on the debates ! We the people are eager to see pilots of the Jimmy and Fritz , Jerry and Bob shows before deciding if we want to vote for one to premiere in January . <P> Sue Tracy Maplewood , Minn . <P> <P> No , Never ! <P> Pardon , amnesty , forgiveness Sept. 6 . No , never ! <P> Who in hell is going to fight the next war ? Those unsophisticated Soviets will not be deterred by the peace sign . <P> Calvin D. Ream Wewahitchka , Fla . <P> Jimmy Carter exhibited a tremendous amount of courage in making his policy statement on amnesty and pardon at an American Legion convention , in view of the paranoid patriotism that is always present . <P> The pardon would grant forgiveness in the hope that this country can get behind it the nightmare of Viet Nam . <P> Jack R.
