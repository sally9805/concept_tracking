When the dim lightning of mediocre minds strikes the same place twice , that place is invariably Broadway . Two weeks ago , the first musical ever based on a record album , the less than divine Jesus Christ Superstar , opened at the Mark Hellinger Theatre . Last week the second musical based on an album , Melvin Van Peebles ' Ai nt Supposed to Die a Natural Death , opened at the Ethel Barrymore Theatre . Catastrophes traditionally come in threes , but let us pray that the real Jesus Christ will spare us that . <P> Ai nt is a jumbled-up , quasi-Brechtian Harlem re-do of Elmer Rice 's Street Scene . Manhattan has grown seedier , in or out of Harlem , since Rice wrote . The people talk tougher now , and are more frantic , more terribly frustrated . <P> Van Peebles , famed for his movie Sweet Sweetback 's Baadasssss Song ( TIME , Aug. 16 ) , has brought his bile into the theater , but left his craft at the stage door . Ai nt is a series of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addicts , corrupt cops , Panthers and jailbirds-all the characters who would be promptly denounced as racist stereotypes if a white playwright dared to suggest their existence . Inevitably , there are quite a few moments of truth , a quite poignant one when a country boy ( Ralph Wilcox ) finds out that his sister ( Barbara Alston ) who fled to the city has become a prostitute . But the book is torpid , the music is undistinguished and the words are undistinguishable , thanks to a faulty sound system and a resolutely amateurish cast . <P> To try to dramatize the agony of black confinement is fair enough , but nowadays the ghetto can be as chic as Fifth Avenue . In their self-indulgent militancy , black playwrights of Van Peebles ' frenzied stamp like to think that they are raising welts on The Man 's conscience . Actually , they are catering to a masochistic mea culpa claque and assorted liberal breast beaters .
