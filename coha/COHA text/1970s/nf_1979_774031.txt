txt MACRO-ECONOMICS the marginal efficiency of capital ( MEC ) . The quantity of capital demanded depends upon the relationship between the MEC and the market rate of interest . We take the MEC curve in Fig. 11 to represent the aggregate demand for capital . Although the MEC for different types of capital assets will be different at any given time , we are assuming profit maximisation determines investment behaviour so that the MEC schedule of capital will be the aggregate of the MEC schedules in different industries . The equilibrium level of private investment can now be determined . It is that level at which the market rate of interest is equal to the marginal efficiency of capital . In Fig. 11 when the rate of interest is OR the level of investment will be OM . If the rate of interest falls to OR ' , investment will increase to OM ' . If the rate of interest is very high only a few projects will appear profitable . If the rate of interest falls , projects with lower expected returns will now offer the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one ; businessmen will purchase capital up to the point where the marginal productivity of capital is equal to its cost ( i.e. where the MEC curve cuts the interest rate line ) . According to this theory , the investment function will be I = f(r) , where r is the rate of interest . Much of this analysis can be applied to the public sector . Investment in the nationalised industries is now evaluated on a commercial basis which makes use of the discounted cash flow techniques described above . Many investment proposals in the public sector are subject to cost ? benefit analysis . The net social benefits are discounted and the present values of these expected benefits are then compared with their costs . Even where this kind of assessment is not thought appropriate , public investment is likely to be affected by movements in the rate of interest , more especially , those longer term projects where interest charges form a substantial part of total costs . The inclusion of the public sector does not alter the basic conclusion that planned investment can be related to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sloping demand curve . THE INFLUENCE OF THE RATE OF INTEREST The basis of this theory , which holds that the level of investment is dependent upon the rate of interest , is subject to much dispute . There are some good reasons for supposing that investment decisions may not be so sensitive to interest changes as the theory seems to imply . 1 . The degree of uncertainty surrounding the investment decision makes it impossible to obtain precise estimates of the MEC which can be compared with the rate of interest . The businessman is likely to work with estimates which give a fairly wide range of possible returns , a // range , perhaps , of some 10 or 15 per cent . This will mean that relatively small changes in interest rates will not make much difference to his calculations . While this may be true of short-term projects , longer-life investments such as buildings are affected to a much greater extent by changes in the rate of interest . 2 . Large enterprises usually engage on long-range planning which calls for an investment programme spread over many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to disturb these plans to any serious extent . 3 . The rate of interest , in certain circumstances , may not be viewed as a major item in the firm 's costs . Interest charges may be claimed as costs for purposes of taxation so that the burden of interest payments is offset to some extent by reductions in tax payments . In times of inflation the real burden of interest charges is reduced by rising prices . If prices are rising at 5 per cent per annum , and the rate of interest is 8 per cent , the real rate of interest is about 3 per cent . 4 . Even when interest rates are low , firms may be unable to borrow as much as they would like . If the government is operating a credit squeeze ' funds will be difficult to obtain because of quantitative restrictions . The amount of planned investment would then be more influenced by the availability of credit than by its cost . 5 . Investment in stocks , at least in the manufacturing sector , does not seem to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Interest charges are normally a small part of total costs , and , in any case , much stock holding is financed by trade credit , the charges on which do not usually move with market rates of interest . Where stock holding is a major function as in retailing and wholesaling , firms may be more sensitive to interest rate changes , although when prices are rising , stock appreciation could offset any interest rate effects . EXPECTATIONS One of the difficulties in using the Keynesian theory as a tool of economic policy is the fact that the MEC is likely to be very unstable . The calculation of the MEC is very much a matter of forecasts , expectations , hunches and guesses . Business expectations are bound to be strongly influenced by current optimism and pessimism and hence will be subject to sudden shifts as confidence rises or falls . Changes in expectations alter the whole basis of the MEC . Rising hopes will mean higher expected returns and the MEC curve will shift to the right . A sudden collapse of business confidence will cause a downward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curve will move bodily to the left . With an unstable demand curve , therefore , it is extremely difficult to predict just what will be the demand for investment goods at any // given rate of interest . Keynes himself was well aware of this problem and he stressed the importance of expectations in the determination of the rate of planned investment . Investment and income Of all those factors which are most likely to influence investment , the one most susceptible to short-term variations is the expectation of profit . Expectations are most closely related to movements in current income . Investment which stems from the desire of firms to meet an increase in the demand for their product is known as induced investment . This type of investment is related to movements in current income , or , more accurately , it is related to the rate of change of income . Investment which is determined independently of current income is known as autonomous investment , some examples of which are given on page 53 . Induced investment is the basis for a theory of investment known as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that firms try to maintain some constant relationship between the level of output and the stock of capital required to produce that output . In other words , we assume a constant capital ? output ratio which can either be expressed in physical terms or in money terms . The accelerator helps us to understand how small increases in demand in one sector can be magnified and spread throughout the economy . It can best be explained by using a simple arithmetical example . Assume a given manufacturing industry , producing consumer goods , which has , ( a ) a capital ? output ratio of 2 , i.e. ? 1000 worth of capital is required to produce ? 500 worth of consumer goods per annum , ( b ) machines whose average life is 10 years , and ( c ) a capital stock which has been built up evenly over time so that 10 per cent of the capital stock becomes due for replacement each year . Table 4 nook provides us with the data necessary for an understanding of the accelerator . In Year 1 we find that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a capital stock of ? 20000 and a regular replacement demand valued at ? 2000 . We now assume that sales rise to ? 12000 . In order to meet this demand the industry requires ? 24000 worth of capital equipment . Its annual demand for capital now increases from ? 2000 to ? 6000 ( replacements plus additional units ) . A rise of 20 per cent in // consumer demand has led to a rise of 200 per cent in investment demand . In Year 3 consumption demand rises again to a figure of ? 13000 . How does this affect the industry 's demand for capital goods ? Its replace ment demand is still ? 2000 worth of equipment ( the machines bought ten years earlier ) and it will require an additional ? 2000 worth of capital to meet the increased demand for its output . In fact total investment demand falls from ? 6000 to ? 4000 . Note that a simple increase in consumer demand is not sufficient to maintain the level of investment . In order to hold the level of investment to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to increase at the same rate ( i.e. ? 2000 per annum ) . It is the rate of change in consumption which determines the amount of induced investment . A slow-down in the rate of growth of consumer spending can cause an absolute decline in the orders to the capital goods industries . The reader can verify this by noting the effects in Years 3 , 4 , 5 and 6 . Note what happens in Year 8 when consumption declines from ? 14000 to ? 13000 . The demand for new equipment falls to zero although sales are 30 per cent higher than they were at the beginning of the sequence . The example provides us with some ideas on why the swings in the level of activity in the capital goods industries are much greater than those experienced by the consumer goods industries . The extent of the accelerator effect depends largely upon the durability of the capital equipment . If the life of the machines in our example had been 5 years instead of 10 the accelerator effect would have been much smaller . SOME QUALIFICATIONS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leverage effect of the accelerator only takes effect if the industry is operating at or near full // capacity . If the industry has excess capacity it can meet a larger demand by increasing output on its underutilised equipment . Additional machines will only be ordered when the increased demand is believed to be permanent otherwise firms will deal with the additional orders by running down stocks or operating waiting lists . If the rise in the demand for investment comes at a time when the capital goods industries are fully employed , it could well lead to an increase in the prices of capital goods . This may lead to some reduction in the demand for capital and encourage the adoption of more capitalsaving techniques . If this is so the accelerator effect will be reduced . Nevertheless , in spite of these qualifications , there is empirical evidence to support the accelerator theory both in the USA and in the UK . Summary We have now considered a number of influences on investment demand . It is clear that there are several determining factors affecting the rate of planned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of any one particular theory of investment . It appears that a large part of investment is autonomous ( i.e. independent of the level of income ) . This will be true of a substantial part of public investment as well as that part of private investment stimulated by technical progress , growth in foreign trade and the long term plans of large corporations . Accelerator investment is induced investment in so far as it is related to the rate of change of current income , but if there is a time lag in the process , current income may not be the determining influence . Expectations are a major determinant of short-term movements in the rate of private investment and these will be subject to a wide range of influences . The rate of interest also plays a part , although the extent of its influence on the level of investment is subject to much dispute . More is said on this point in the chapter on monetary policy . 64 7 The Determination of Equilibrium We are now ready to show how the equilibrium level of income can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sectors ? households and firms . Before proceeding with the analysis we should restate the assumptions on which it is based : ( a ) There are unemployed resources ( b ) The techniques of production remain unchanged ( c ) The hours worked by each worker remain unchanged ( d ) Prices remain constant Output , income , and employment , therefore will be determined by aggregate demand . Our simple model has only one injection ? investment , and one leakage ? savings . Equilibrium , we know , requires that leakages should equal injections and in our model that means that planned savings should equal planned investment . Since there is no government sector , there will be no taxation . We also assume that firms pay out all their profits . Personal disposable income , therefore , is equal to national income . The whole of factor income is received by households who can either spend it or save it . There are two approaches to the problem of equilibrium . We can ask : 1 . What level of income will generate sufficient planned saving to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ income will generate sufficient planned consumption plus planned investment to buy the whole of current output ? We shall take each approach in turn , beginning with an explanation of equilibrium in terms of saving and investment . Income is equal to output so that saving may be regarded as that part of output which consumers are prepared to forgo ; that is , to leave for purposes other than consumption . If the amount of total output forgone by consumers is exactly equal to the demands by firms for capital formation ( including additions to stocks ) then planned saving is equal to planned investment , total demand is equal to total supply and // equilibrium will exist . But if consumers plan to save more or less than firms plan to invest there will be a situation of disequilibrium . Table 5 and Fig. 12 should help us to get the picture more clearly . The table shows us ( a ) the plans of households and firms at different levels of income , ( b ) the realised situation which results from the inter-action of households ' and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on output and income . We assume that households ' plans to spend and save are realised . In Table 5 , column 1 indicates possible levels of total output ( = income ) . Column 2 shows the levels of planned consumption appropriate to the different levels of income . Column 3 gives details of // the saving planned at each level of income ? these details are derived from columns 1 and 2 . In column 4 we have the investment intentions of firms and , for the purpose of this exercise , we assume investment to be autonomous . Total planned expenditure is obtained by summing the amounts in columns 2 and 4 ( i.e. C + I ) and is shown in column 5 . The amount of investment which actually takes place ( realised investment ) is given in column 6 and will consist of unplanned plus planned investment . For example , when income is at the level 1600 , planned investment is 200 and unplanned investment amounts to 100 ( expenditure falls short of output by 100 so that there is an unplanned increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1400 are investment plans realised . At higher levels of income expenditure falls short of planned output and there will be unplanned investment . At lower levels of income , expenditure exceeds the value of current output and there will be unplanned dis investment ( stocks will run down ) . These effects are seen in Fig. 12 . The equilibrium level of income , therefore , is 1400 . This is the only situation where total demand is equal to total supply , where the plans of producers are in harmony with the plans of spenders and there are no forces at work tending to change the level of output . It is , of course , the level of income at which planned saving is equal to planned invest ment . Table 5 can be used in the second approach . Column 5 ( = 2 + 4 ) provides us with details of the level of aggregate demand at each level of income . Column 1 indicates the level of planned output . Equilibrium requires that Only at the income level 1400 does Planned Output ( Column 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ levels of income firms will be paying out more in factor incomes than they are receiving back in the form of sales receipts ? they will reduce output . At lower levels of income they will be receiving more in sales receipts than they are paying out in the form of factor incomes ? they will expand output . The short-term adjustments will take the form of changes in the levels of stocks ( i.e. unplanned investment or disinvestment ) . These same relationships may be seen very clearly in Fig. 13 . In Fig. 13(i) expenditure is marked on the vertical axis and income is shown on the horizontal axis . We use the same conventions as developed earlier so that the 45 ? line shows all points of equality , Expenditure = Income . The line CC represents consumption spending at different levels of income , while the C + I line shows total expenditure in a two-sector // economy . Investment amounts to the vertical distance between the CC line and the C + I line . Since we are assuming investment is autonomous the two lines are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ income . Now the vertical distance between the CC line and the 45 ? line must indicate the amount of saving at any given level of income . For example , when income is OD , consumption will be FD and saving amounts to FG . At this level of income , investment is FJ . Income is equal to output and it can be seen that only when income is at OB do we have an // equilibrium situation where total supply ( OB ) = total demand ( BK + HK ) . At this level of income planned savings = planned investment since both are equal to HK . At higher levels of income such as OD we note that total expenditure DJ is less than the value of output ( GD = OD ) . This is because planned savings ( GF ) is greater than planned investment ( FJ ) . Output ( = income ) will be reduced and will tend to fall to OB . At lower levels of income such as OA , total expenditure ( AM ) is greater than the value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saving is zero , while planned investment is ML . Injections exceed leakages and income will tend to expand to OB . Fig. 13(ii) looks at the same situation but concentrates the view taken in our first approach ; that is , the relationships between planned I and planned S. The savings line is derived from Fig. 13(i) , as explained earlier . The investment line is parallel to the horizontal axis since I is constant . Again it can be seen that OB is the only equilibrium level of income . At higher or lower levels of income , divergencies between planned S and planned I will set up changes in production plans which will cause income and output to move towards OB . Changes in equilibrium Given the investment and propensity to consume schedules there is one and only one equilibrium level at which income tends to settle . Diagrammatically it has been shown to be determined where the C + I cuts the 45 ? line . In this position firms will find that they have made the correct output decisions since they will be able to sell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changes in their stocks . By taking : Y to mean current planned output ( = income ) , C to mean current planned consumption spending and I to mean current planned investment spending , the equilibrium condition is Y = C + I and any disequilibrium situation will tend to correct itself by changes in output plans . But what will happen if there is a change in planned investment ? The investment schedule will move and , assuming no change in the savings schedule , a new equilibrium will be established where planned S = planned I. Alternatively we can say that the aggregate demand schedule ( C + I ) will move and a new equilibrium situation will arise when aggregate demand again equals planned output . These changes are illustrated in Fig. 14 . The original aggregate demand function is C + I so that the equilibrium level of income is OA where planned expenditure ( C + I ) // equals planned output ( OA ) . Another view of the same situation is presented in Fig. 14(ii) where equilibrium income is established by the equality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investment , at all levels of income , in-creases by an amount Al . The demand curve shifts to C + I ' ( Fig. 14(i) ) and the investment line from I to I ' ( Fig. 14(ii) ) . Income and output will now increase by an amount A Y to the new equilibrium level OB . As one would expect , an increase in planned investment has led to an in- // crease in output and income , but the interesting feature is that the resulting change in income is much greater than the change in invest ment ( A Y Al ) . The nature of the relationship between A Y and AI is explained by one of the most important concepts in economics ? the multiplier . THE MULTIPLIER The multiplier describes the fact that changes in spending have an impact on income that is greater than the original change in spending . Since we are dealing with a two-sector economy , we shall explain the multiplier process by means of a change in investment spending . Later we shall see that there is a multiplier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ components of aggregate demand . Beginning from a position of equilibrium we can suppose that invest ment spending is increased due to a substantial increase in the pro-gramme of housebuilding . Assume that the rate of investment in housing has been fairly stable for some time at ? 1000m. per month and it now increases to ? 1100m. per month . Hence AI = ? 100m . The immediate effect of this increase in investment will be an increase in the incomes received by construction workers , who , we assume , had been previously unemployed . Incomes in this industry will rise by ? 100m. per month . If the MPC of the community is constant at 0.8 then ? 80m. of this additional income will be spent and ? 20m. saved . But this is not the end of the matter , because the producers of the goods and services bought by these construction workers will find their incomes increased by ? 80m . This particular group will proceed to spend ? 64m. and save ? 16m . And so it will go on ? each round of spending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed on . Setting out the sequence more formally we have , These rounds of spending will continue until the amounts have become infinitely small . It must be noted that we are equating each round of spending with a corresponding increase in income . This means that we are assuming that businessmen react immediately to changes in spending by changing their production plans . The eventual increase in income is the sum of the successive rounds of spending generated by the increase in investment . It is , in fact , a // geometric series diminishing to infinity . There is a simple formula for summing such a series : The common ratio of the series we are dealing with is 0.8 ; it is the factor by which each term is multiplied in order to obtain the succeeding term . Hence : As a result of the multiplier process , income has increased by an amount 5 times greater than the change in investment . But we can put it in more precise terms than this . The common ratio ( 0.8 ) used in the formula above is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ series might therefore be written , The expression in the brackets is the multiplier . The size of the multiplier obviously depends upon the size of the MPC . The larger the MPC ( the smaller the MPS ) the larger is the multiplier . All we are saying is that the greater the amount of income passed on at each stage , the larger will be each term in the series and hence the larger will be the eventual rise in total income . SAVINGS AND THE MULTIPLIER We have seen how an increase in one of the injections ( investment ) will cause income to expand by a multiple of the change in the level of spending . It will be seen later than any change in either a leakage or an injection will cause income to change until leakages are once again equal to injections . In a two-sector economy a change in investment will cause income to change until planned savings are once again equal to planned investment . We can develop the earlier example to show the change in savings as well as in income . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expenditure and income as follows : to sum the first column to a total of ? 500m . Exactly the same procedure enables us to obtain the sum of the series for consumption spending and saving . Note that the expansion of income continues until planned saving is again equal to planned investment ? both increase by ? 100m . The economy is now in equilibrium . The process is presented diagram-matically in Fig. 15 . If there is a change in the level of S or I so that planned S is not equal to planned l then income will change until these planned aggregates are once again equal to one another . Worked Example // There is no government or foreign trade ; the economy is in equilibrium . What would be the effect on income if planned investment increased by 50 ? Initially , Therefore , Investment now increases to 450 . We have used the formula // New level of national income = 1 125 Note that saving at this level of income will be 0.4 x 1 125 = 450 ( = Investment ) . Income @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The multiplier is a most important key to an understanding of economic fluctuations . Not only does it explain how relatively small increases in spending plans can exert considerable upward pressure on income , it // also helps to explain why relatively small decreases in the rate of spend ing might lead to serious falls in income and employment . The multiplier is a two-edged weapon ? it cuts both ways . Just as additional income is respent to create still further income , so any cut in spending will reduce income which , in turn , will lead to further cuts in spending and income in a cumulative manner . It should be easy for the reader to recast our arithmetical example ( page 71 ) to show the effects when planned investment falls by ? 100m . The terms in the geometric series will now have negative signs and the ultimate effect will be that national income falls by ? 500m . Income will fall until planned saving is again equal to planned investment . THE PARADOX OF THRIFT The fact that income must always move to the level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to one of the most important paradoxes in economics . The paradox of thrift explains how , under certain circumstances , an attempt to increase saving may lead to a fall in total savings . Any attempt to save more which is not matched by an equal willingness to invest more will create a deficiency of demand . Leakages will exceed injections and income will fall to a new equilibrium level . Fig. 16 illustrates the effects of an increase in the propensity to save . In Fig. 16(i) we have only autonomous investment and the savings line giving an initial equilibrium level of income OM . An increase in the propensity to save ( i.e. people attempt to save more at all levels of // income ) raises the savings curve to S ' S ' . Income falls to OM ' and the level of saving remains unchanged . In Fig. 16(ii) investment includes both Autonomous and induced elements . In this case an increase in the propensity to save reduce income from OM to OM ' , but the level of saving itself falls . The attempt to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explanation for this , of course , is that an increase in the propensity to save is the same thing as a fall in the propensity to consume . This is an autonomous fall in one of the components of aggregate demand which will have downward multiplier effects on income . 76 8 Output and Employment The simplifying assumptions on which the present analysis is based enable us to relate changes in output and income directly to changes in employment . We have seen how the equilibrium level of output is determined by aggregate demand and we known that the level of output determines the level of employment . Ever since the Keynesian revolution ' , full employment has ranked highly amongst the goals of government policy . This leads us , therefore , to the idea of a desired ' level of output ? that output which will provide full employment for the labour force . Equilibrium in the market for goods and services obtains when aggregate demand is just sufficient to absorb current output at constant prices . Now it does not follow that an equilibrium situation in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the market for labour ( i.e. full employment ) . This is one of the most important points to emerge from the Keynesian analysis of income determination . A deficiency of aggregate demand Suppose we have a given aggregate demand function ( C + I ) as in Fig. 17(i) . This will produce an equilibrium level of output OB . The output of goods and services required to maintain a full employment situation , however , may be OD . In this case , at the full employment level of income ( OD ) there is a deficiency of aggregate demand equal to the vertical distance between the C + I line and the 45 ? line . This deficiency is known as a deflationary gap . If firms were to produce an output equal in value to OD , the deflationary gap measures the value of output which would remain unsold . With the given aggregate demand schedule the economy would settle in equilibrium at OB and this level of income would be associated with unemployment of labour and under-capacity operation of capital equipment . This situation will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planned I or both . In the two-sector economy , the deflationary gap represents an excess of // planned S over planned I at the full employment level of income . This is clearly seen in Fig. 17(ii) . The important point to grasp is that there is no guarantee that equilibrium output will be large enough to ensure the full employment of labour and capital . If the propensities to spend by the private sector are insufficient to generate the required level of output , the deflationary gap must be closed by the appropriate public policy . This is discussed in Chapters 9 and 20. // Excess demand It is possible that planned consumption and planned investment might produce a level of aggregate demand greater than that required to produce the full employment output at constant prices . Such a situation is illustrated in Fig. 18(i) . Equilibrium output is OY , determined at the intersection of the C + Iline and the 45 ? line . Suppose , however , that OX , represents a full employment level of output . At this output , planned spending exceeds the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gap in the diagram . This gap measures the extent of MACRO-ECONOMICS the excess demand over the maximum output at constant prices . Spending plans in real terms can not be realised and inflationary pressures will be present in the economy . This excess demand must be eliminated by a cut in C or I or both . Again , it will probably require some deliberate act of public policy to bring about the required changes in spending ( see Chapter 20 ) . As in the previous example , the inflationary gap may be seen in terms of injections and withdrawals . Fig. 18(ii) shows the inflationary gap as an excess of investment over savings at the full employment level of income . AN EQUILIBRIUM LEVEL OF EMPLOYMENT The last section indicated that an equilibrium level of output did not necessarily produce the desired level of employment . It seems logical at this stage to ask what is meant by an equilibrium situation in the market for labour . Using the traditional supply and demand analysis we would define such an equilibrium as a situation where the demand for labour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( i.e. the level of wages ) such that no forces were at work , within the system , tending to change the numbers employed at that wage rate . The classical economists believed that the economy would always tend towards such an equilibrium and , moreover , it would be a full employment equilibrium . If a disequilibrium were to arise , market forces would restore the full employment equilibrium . Unemployment would lead to competition for jobs and force down the wage rate until it became profitable for firms to re-employ the surplus labour . The experience of persistent unemployment during the 1930s finally discredited these views . The inter-war period demonstrated that there could be an under-employment equilibrium in the market for labour . But , in any case , a reduction in money wages might not bring about an increase in employment . Wages are incomes as well as costs and the fall in wages might cause a fall in aggregate demand which would worsen the employment situation . Instead of tending towards a full employment equilibrium , falling wages could set off a downward spiral of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labour market is also possible where aggregate demand is at a level which exceeds the supply of labour ? a situation usually described as one of over full employment . It would be a disequilibrium situation because there would be a tendency for prices to rise . The scarcity of labour would cause employers to bid up the price of labour , passing on the increased labour costs in the form of higher prices . A general increase in prices would no doubt lead to demands for higher wages and there would be the beginnings of a wage ? price spiral . ( See Chapter 17. ) // The policy aim of governments is a full employment equilibrium , but it is difficult , if not impossible , to provide a precise and meaningful definition of full employment . Whatever meaning is given to the term it clearly relates to some particular relationship between the demand for and supply of labour . It is the interpretations given to these terms , especially the supply of labour , which makes it so difficult to be precise about the meaning and measurement of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be defined in terms of the number of man-hours of labour supplied at any given wage rate over some given period of time . The amount of labour supplied can be varied without any change in the numbers of people employed . Existing workers may work longer hours ( e.g. overtime ) or they may be placed on short-time ' ( i.e. working three or four days each week ) . Over the longer period the aggregate supply of labour from any given labour force will tend to fall if there are pressures for a shorter working week and longer holidays . In discussions of employment and unemployment , however , it is usual to refer to the supply of labour in terms of the number of persons seeking work . Since there are limits to the amount of overtime the labour force will accept , and limits to the amount of short-time working which can be offered , it is reasonable to expect that the numbers employed will vary with total output . The level of employment will depend , at least in part , on how many of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this appears to be about 60 per cent of those over the age of 16 . This participation rate , ' as it is called , is an important concept since it is subject to short-term variation . In other words , there is a degree of elasticity in the aggregate supply of labour even in the short term , and this causes difficulties when we attempt to measure the true extent of unemployment ( i.e. the amount of surplus labour ) . The participation rate is influenced by the current demand for labour . When the unemployment level is high more married women may try to enter the labour force in order to supplement the family income . Similar conditions in the labour market may persuade many young people to stay on in further education in order to acquire better qualifications or to postpone entry to the labour market until conditions are more favourable . On the other hand , in good times when jobs are plentiful more people , especially married women and retired people seeking part-time work , will be tempted to enter the labour force . Thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the economy . In the UK the extent of unemployment is measured by reference to // the number of persons who are formally registered as unemployed . This figure will understate the amount of surplus labour since registration is also a requirement for obtaining unemployment benefits . People seeking work , but not entitled to such benefits do not have the same incentive to register . This group will include married women who do not pay the full rate of national insurance , young people who have not yet paid the qualifying amount of national insurance , and a fairly large number of people who will take part-time jobs when the labour market is favourable , but will not register as being available for work at other times . In some countries the extent of unemployment is measured by means of household surveys in which people are asked if they are actually looking for work . If the sample of households is adequate this method probably gives a better indication of unemployment in the sense of the numbers actively seeking work but unable to find it . If this number is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indication of the aggregate supply of labour measured in terms of the potential labour force . THE DEMAND FOR LABOUR The demand for labour is a derived demand . Labour is not demanded for its own sake , but for the goods and services it can produce . Just as there are problems in trying to measure the supply of labour so there are similar problems in trying to assess the demand . The number of persons actually in employment is one indicator of the current demand for // labour . Movements in the numbers at work give some idea of the direction in which the demand for labour is moving . A further useful statistic is the number of unfilled vacancies . The official register of un-filled vacancies , however , is likely to understate the demand for labour since not all employers register their vacancies and those who do may not register all their vacancies . We do not know , therefore , the full extent of the demand for labour . The official statistics of registered unemployed and unfilled vacancies help to give us a picture of trends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decrease in the other as Fig. 19 shows . A major problem in trying to apply the elementary techniques of supply and demand to the total labour market is that demand and supply may not refer to the same thing . Employers may be demanding labour of a different type to that which is available . The demand for labour is derived from the demands for a great variety of goods and services and the nature of these demands is always changing . The supply of labour comprises a wide variety of skills and abilities . The changing demands for goods and services give rise to a continually changing pattern of demand for labour . Given the real world im-mobilities , both occupational and geographical , in the labour force it is apparent that there will always be some unemployed people while , at the same time , some employers are looking for labour . This feature of the labour market is known as frictional unemployment . FULL EMPLOYMENT The difficulties associated with the interpretation and measurement of the supply of and demand for labour should serve to remind us that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early stages of development . The fact that many economic terms have come into common use should not delude us into thinking that we know all there is to know about such things . Full employment is one such term . What does it mean ? On the simplest level it could mean that the total available supply of labour was completely absorbed into gainful employment . We have already noted that , in the real world , this can not possibly be achieved . Since labour is not perfectly mobile between places and occupations , there are many separate labour markets each with its own supply and demand conditions . A definition of full employment which requires that the demand for and supply of labour be equated in each and every labour market is not tenable . An alternative definition would require the sum of the demands in all the labour markets to be equal to the sum of the supplies , even though in several of these markets there may be an excess of demand over supply or supply over demand . This is the meaning usually given to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accepts the existence of some unrequited demand and some unused supply . The unemployment which is consistent with a state of full employment will be frictional unemployment . Although we have a definition of full employment it is a very different matter to say when such a situation exists . Some authorities would say that full employment exists when there is a balance between the unfilled vacancies and the numbers unemployed . Unfortunately these statistics do not provide an accurate picture of the supply and demand situation . In any case these concepts are aggregates which could mask uneven occupational and geographical distributions of unemployment . A balance between the numbers looking for work and the number of jobs available to them is not in itself sufficient evidence of full employment since it is conceivable that a situation might arise where there were , say , two million out of work and two million vacancies . This could hardly be described a full employment . Any acceptable definition of full employment demands that the existing amount of unemployment be relatively small . Another way of assessing the employment situation is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it with the number of workers unemployed . Lord Beveridge in his classic work Full Employment in a Free Society ( 1944 ) used this technique and estimated that something like 3 per cent of the working population might be unemployed at any one time for frictional ' reasons . In fact this figure is well above the average unemployment figure for the UK over the greater part of the post-war period . From 1945 to 1969 the average rate was rather less than 2 per cent . Beveridge , of course , based his estimates on studies carried out before the war and he lacked adequate statistics on unfilled vacancies . Given the possible variations in the participation rate and the inadequacy of data on the demand for labour it is very difficult to obtain a precise measure of frictional unemployment . Some guide as to the nature of the unemployment problem might be obtained from the statistics showing the length of time which unemployed persons have been on the register . If the average duration of unemployment is fairly short this might be taken as an indication that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the authorities must use the available evidence of registered unemployed , unfilled vacancies and the duration of unemployment as rough guides in assessing whether there is an excess supply or excess demand for labour . Full employment , however , is such an important aspect of policy that political judgements must also be considered . It seems that for the UK an unemployment rate above 2 per cent is not regarded as politically acceptable . Employment policy is discussed in Chapter 20. 84 9 The Government Sector Up to this point we have worked with a very simple model of a twosector economy . The aim of this chapter is to introduce a government sector into the model and examine the manner in which government income and expenditure affect the national income . The government can expand total demand through its purchases of goods and services , ' or by stimulating private spending by means of tax reductions . Similarly it can reduce total demand by decreasing its own spending or by increasing taxation , or both . Government spending may be treated in the same way as investment ? it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Taxation may be regarded as a leakage from that circular flow . The size of the government sector The government sector , which includes both central and local authorities , is a major part of the UK and most other economies . The size of the public sector may be defined in various ways . If we take the role of government and publicly owned bodies as employers of labour , the public sector accounts for well over 25 per cent of the nation 's labour force . Another way of measuring the importance of the public sector is to take the value of the output of publicly owned institutions and add it to the value of the purchases by public authorities from the private sector . For the UK this measure indicates that 35 ? 40 per cent of economic activity is either under public ownership or dependent upon public sector activities . Perhaps the most widely used indicator of the importance of the public sector is the figure for total public expenditure . In the UK this amounts to about 50 per cent of the Gross National Product . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ categories : ( a ) Public authorities ' consumption spending ( b ) Public authorities ' investment spending ( c ) Transfer payments ( pensions , family allowances , interest on debt , and so on ) . // This is an important breakdown since as Fig. 20 shows , in the UK about two fifths of public expenditure is devoted to the third category ? transfer payments . These consist of transfers of money which are spent privately by households and firms . Thus a large part of total public spending does not take the form of direct spending on goods and services . To the extent that these transfers are financed from taxation , they simply amount to a redistribution of income . Only the first two categories constitute demands by the public sector on the real resources available to the economy . In other words , the proportion of national output devoted to collective rather than private purchases amounts to about 30 per cent of the GNP . This is the part of public spending which affects aggregate demand directly . We must bear in mind , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distribution of disposable income . They will affect the con sumption function and hence have some influence on aggregate demand . Quite apart from its sheer size another reason for differentiating the public sector from the private sector is that the motivations for spending are different . In the private sector we assume that the motives for spending are the maximisation of personal satisfactions in the case of households , and the maximisation of profits in the case of firms . The expenditures in the public sector are not determined by habits , personal preferences or profit expectations , but by political decision . They are subject to the collective will of the people expressed through their // central and local legislatures . How large should the public sector be ? The answer to this question is political rather than economic . Even when there is broad agreement on the range of goods and services which should be provided collectively there is still room for wide disagreement on the proportion of the nation 's resources which should be devoted to the public sector . The budgetary framework The annual Budget sets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the year ahead together with a statement of the revenue and expenditure for the past financial year . The original purpose of the Budget was to raise just sufficient revenue to cover public expenditure ; it was regarded as most desirable that the Budget should be balanced . Nowadays , the Budget is used as the major instrument of economic policy and a budget surplus or deficit may be deliberately planned in order to bring about economic changes . This deliberate manipulation of G and T is known as fiscal policy which may be formally defined as the policy that government receipts and expenditures should be consciously planned , particularly in their aggregate amounts so as to effect beneficial changes in the overall level of incomes , prices , and employment ' . We shall look at the use of fiscal policy later in this chapter ; for the moment , we shall be concerned with the instruments of that policy , one aspect of which ? public expenditure ? has already been discussed . TAXATION Taxes may be structured in various ways . A proportional tax requires all taxpayers to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or expenditure in taxation . A person with a large income would pay more than a person with a small income , but each would have the same percentage of income taken in taxation . In the UK , Corporation Tax and Value Added Tax are examples of proportional taxes . A progressive tax is one which removes a greater proportion of income or wealth from the better-off members of the community . The highly paid person might pay 50 to 60 per cent of his income in tax whereas the person in the lower income groups might only pay 5 per cent of his income in taxation . Such a tax is held to be more equitable than a proportional tax because it bears a closer relationship to the ability to pay . Income Tax and Capital Transfer Tax are examples of progressive taxes . A regressive tax is one in which the proportion of income or wealth taken in taxation decreases as the amount of income or wealth increases . In the UK there are no taxes structured in this manner . // A flat-rate tax imposes the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the UK is the same for all car owners whether they be rich or poor . This type of tax is widely used as the basis for expenditure taxes . In the UK the excise duties on petrol , tobacco and alcoholic drinks are all levied on a flat-rate basis . Taxes are usually divided into two categories , direct and indirect . Direct taxes are those levied on income and wealth and the burden of such taxes is borne by those upon whom they are levied . Income tax , corporation tax and capital transfer tax are examples of direct taxes and , as such , they are collected by the Inland Revenue Department . Indirect taxes are imposed on items of expenditure and , in this case , it is possible for the person on whom the tax is levied to pass on the burden , or part of it , in the form of higher prices . Just how much of the tax burden can be transferred in this way depends upon the elasticities of supply and demand . If the commodity on which the tax is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to price ( consumers have very strong preferences for it ) it will be possible for the seller to embody most of the tax in an increased price . Customs and excise duties and the value added tax provide examples of indirect taxes . They are collected by the Customs and Excise Department . Indirect taxes are said to be regressive in their effects since they are usually of the flat-rate type . The tax paid on any particular purchase represents a greater burden to the poor man than to the rich man . The State also has a substantial source of income in the form of compulsory levies on employers and employees in the form of National Insurance contributions . Although these are not collected by the taxation departments they are , in effect , a form of taxation . The revenues from these contributions are paid into the National Insurance Fund and must be spent on specified social security benefits . The public sector also raises revenue by means of local rates . These are taxes levied by the local authorities on the owners of buildings in their administrative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calls for a substantial modification of our simple model of the economy . Government expenditure ( G ) is treated as being autonomously determined since it is subject to political decision . We regard it , therefore , as being independent of income . Thus , our model now has two injections into the circular flow of income , land G. Taxation ( T ) , both direct and indirect , represents a leakage from the system . Taxes , unlike government spending , can not be treated as autonomous since the revenue from taxation bears a direct relationship // to income , and tax revenue is a function of income . Indirect taxes cause spending at market prices to exceed spending at factor cost so that the whole of current spending does not go on to generate incomes . Direct taxes are a compulsory withdrawal of income from firms and households . Our model now has two leakages , S and T. It is necessary to take account of subsidies which , since they cause the market price to be less than factor cost , can be regarded as negative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taxation ( i.e. indirect taxes ? subsidies ) and Td to stand for direct taxes . The expression for aggregate demand , therefore , is Equilibrium obtains when this planned expenditure at factor cost is equal to the value of planned output at factor cost . This planned output may be expressed in terms of the factor incomes which it will generate . These incomes may be disposed of in three ways : 1 . Part will be spent on consumption ( C ) . 2 . Part will be saved ( S ) . 3 . Part will be taken in direct taxation ( Td ) . Planned output ( = income ) , therefore , may be expressed in the form , Equilibrium requires , The introduction of a government sector means that an equality between planned S and planned I is no longer a necessary condition for equilibrium . A discrepancy between S and Ican be offset by an equal discrepancy between G and T ( where T = Td + It must also be noted that a balanced budget is not a necessary condition for equilibrium all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is illustrated in Fig. 21 , where the equilibrium level of income is seen to be 0 Y. The existence of the public sector also calls for a modification of the consumption function . Consumption expenditure is clearly related to disposable income ( Yd ) ? the income available to households for saving or spending . In the two-sector economy Yd is the same thing as national income ( Y ) since all income is paid out and there is no taxation leakage . In our present model the situation is // Nevertheless it is necessary to express C as a function of Y for purposes of analysis . We wish to know how much planned consumption spending will be generated by any particular level of planned output . For example , if we know that C = of disposable income , and disposable income is of national income we have , and It is also necessary to express the marginal propensities to consume and save as proportions of changes in national income . This is made clear in the worked examples later in this chapter . The government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rates of taxation will have multiplier effects since they will cause changes in aggregate spending which are not related to changes in income . EFFECTS OF CHANGES IN GOVERNMENT SPENDING The government may alter the level of income by changing its own // spending on goods and services , that is by changing the level of G in the equilibrium equation . In order to simplify the analysis of these changes we must make some assumptions : We assume that the rates of taxation ( both direct and indirect ) are unchanged . In other words , the marginal rate of taxation ( t ) is constant . Changes in G are assumed to have no influence on I. MPC ( c ) and MPS ( s ) are constant . There are no transfer payments . Now if government expenditure is increased by an amount AG it will give rise to a multiple expansion of income equal to A Y. It will , in fact , have exactly the same effect as the increase in investment described on pages 71/72 . The series of increments in income generated by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of each increment of income which is spent . The sum of the series ( = A ) 7 ) is so that ( 1 t k ) is the multiplier . Now k = 1 ? marginal rate of leakage = 1 ? ( s + t ) . The multinlier therefore is In fact , it is not likely that tax rates will remain unchanged . Direct taxes are progressive so that the rate of tax leakage will increase as income increases . The multiplier therefore will become smaller as income increases . Worked example An economy is in equilibrium and national income = 1000 . Rates of taxation are constant and equal to of gross income . MPC = APC = of disposable income . What would be the effect on national income of an increase of 100 in government spending on goods and services ? // Saving =ix 4 Y= 4 Y Therefore , APS = MPS = ; marginal rate of taxation = EFFECTS OF CHANGES IN RATES OF TAXATION Changes in the rates of taxation may also be used as a means of in fluencing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to much uncertainty . An increase in direct taxation will reduce disposable income but the eventual effect on spending depends upon the extent to which people are prepared to maintain their expenditures by reducing their savings . An increase in the rates of taxation may alter the pro pensity to consume and hence the multiplier . The effects also depend upon the nature of the tax increase . If it falls mainly on the less pros perous section of the community , where the margin of saving is smaller , it will obviously have a much greater effect on spending than would be the case if the more affluent groups were to bear the main brunt of the increase in taxation . A reduction in taxation will also have uncertain effects for similar reasons . Changes in direct taxes may also have effects upon investment ? this is discussed later . Changes in indirect taxation will also affect consumption . The effects will depend upon the elasticities of demand for the goods in question and on whether the changes in tax rates affect the propensity to consume . If the taxes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expendi tures on these goods tends to increase since the demands are very in-elastic . This may reduce spending on other goods and services so that aggregate demand is reduced . But consumers may decide to maintain their spending in real terms by cutting back their saving . If we again make simplifying assumptions by specifying constant I and G and a constant marginal propensity to consume , it is possible to derive the multiplier effects of changes in the rate of taxation . The first point to note is that the given change in tax revenues will have a smaller multiplier effect than the same change in G or I. The reason is that a change in taxation will lead to a corresponding change in dis posable income , but , since part of disposable income is saved , the full extent of the change in taxation does not fall on spending . For example , if a of disposable income is spent , a reduction of the tax burden of ? l m. will lead to an initial change in spending of only ? 750000 . The second problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the value of the multiplier itself will be affected . The // value of t in the denominator alters when we change the rates of taxation . The effects of changes in the rates of taxation may be illustrated by means of a fairly simple arithmetical example . We shall assume that changes in taxation leave G unaffected , that MPC remains constant , and that rates of taxation are the same at all levels of income . We must further assume that the only tax is an income tax and that there are no transfer payments . This is an equilibrium situation because , Planned injections = Planned leakages Now assume that the government increases the rates of taxation to 0.4 Y. What will be the effects on income ? 1 . Disposable income now equals 0.6 Y and since APS is constant Therefore Income will fall by approximately 272.7. 2 . Alternatively , we can say that the initial effects of the increase in taxation will be to reduce disposable income from 0.8 Y to 0.6 Y ; that is , from 800 to 600 . Therefore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 600 = 450 . The multiplier effects of this fall in C can now be calculated . TRANSFER PAYMENTS For purposes of simplification transfer payments have been assumed // to be zero in the preceding analysis , but it was made clear in the introduction to this chapter that they are an important element in disposable income . Transfer payments financed from taxation are clearly a means of redistributing income . They are not factor incomes and do not contribute directly to national income . Nevertheless they do influence national income since , via their impact on disposable income , they affect the propensity to consume . They may be regarded as negative direct taxes . Even when transfer payments are financed wholly by direct taxes they may still have an expansionary effect on aggregate demand if the MPCs of the recipients are greater than those of the taxpayers from whom the revenue is raised . Fiscal policy The deliberate use of government income and expenditure as an active instrument of economic policy is a relatively new concept . It stems essentially from the work of John Maynard Keynes during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been that the State , like the individual , could not afford to spend more than it received ( through taxation ) . A deficit Budget , it was held , would lead to inflation and increase the National Debt ; both regarded as most undesirable developments . These views were attacked by Keynes and others who argued that a deficit Budget will create demand , but , where the economy is operating at less than full employment , this extra demand will call forth extra output rather than increase prices . In the 1930s unemployment rates were more than 20 per cent so that fears of inflation seemed very inappropriate . The basic idea behind modern fiscal policy is simple enough . We have seen that in a two-sector economy an excess of planned saving over planned investment will lead to a cumulative downward movement of income . Where planned leakages are greater than planned injections at the full employment level of output , the economy will settle at an equilibrium with men and machines lying idle . But it is also possible that planned injections might be greater than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be strong upward pressures on prices . Modern fiscal policy aims to use G and T as compensating devices to deal with situations where aggregate demand is either excessive or deficient at the full employment level of income . It is helpful to divide fiscal measures into two types , automatic and discretionary . AUTOMATIC STABILISERS There are some propensities in government spending and income that // play a compensating role in the economy quite independently of any direct political intervention . The reason for this is that taxation revenues and a large part of public expenditure are both closely related to activity in the private sector . ( a ) Taxation revenue at given tax rates is a function of national income and will tend to rise as income rises and fall as income falls . Where direct taxes are progressive , the tax yield will rise faster than income , and , as income falls , tax yields will fall even faster . Assuming that the government does not change its own spending , progressive taxes will act as a stabilising influence , slowing down the growth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall in aggregate demand when income is falling . ( b ) Transfer payments can also serve as stabilising devices . Some transfer payments such as family allowances and sickness benefits are not affected when income changes , but others such as unemployment benefits and supplementary benefits tend to vary inversely with income and output . When output is falling and unemployment rising these payments prevent disposable incomes falling as fast as factor incomes . Similarly when income and output are rising these payments will decline and national insurance contributions will increase so that aggregate demand does not rise as fast as factor incomes . Where the State supports farm incomes with such schemes as guaranteed price supports there will also be an automatic stabilising effect since farm incomes will not fall proportionately with farm prices , neither will they rise to the same extent as farm prices . The advantage of automatic stabilisers is that , since they are built into the economic system , they require no legislative approval before they can take effect and no new administrative machinery is needed which might delay their implementation . Their effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them or not . The disadvantages of these built-in stabilisers is that they do not come into effect until some de-stabilising change has actually taken place ? they can not prevent the initial change and , although they do have some stabilising influence , they could stabilise the economy at a high unemployment level . They work both ways so that they could operate to delay a much needed recovery from a depression . Automatic stabilisers partially compensate autonomous changes in GNP , but it may be necessary to fully compensate such changes if price stability and full employment are to be achieved . This will require public action of a discretionary nature . DISCRETIONARY FISCAL POLICY Let us suppose that national income is in equilibrium at a level which is // not providing for the full employment of the nation 's labour force ; there is a deficiency of aggregate demand at constant prices . In Fig. 22 equilibrium income is at 0 Y where the aggregate demand curve intersects the 45 ? line . Suppose that full employment calls for an output equal to OY ' . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level shown by the C ' + I ' + G ' line . How can fiscal measures bring about this increase in aggregate demand ? ( a ) Tax changes By means of fiscal policy the government can influence any or all the components of the aggregate demand function ( C + I + G ) . The consumption component may be increased by reductions in direct and indirect taxes . A reduction in direct taxes increases disposable income and leaves people more to spend . The multiplier effects will depend upon the size of the marginal propensity to consume . If the tax cuts are biased in favour of the lower income groups the multiplier effect will be greater . A cut in indirect taxes will have a similar effect ? a given level of disposable income will now purchase more goods and services . Provided G and I remain unchanged , tax reductions will cause an upward shift of the aggregate demand function . Tax reductions might also be used to stimulate private investment . Cuts in income tax and indirect taxes will improve business prospects and lead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improve // the profitability of investment . Tax reductions might also take the form of increased tax allowances on investment projects . If these measures are successful , investment will increase and the aggregate demand curve will move upwards . ( b ) Change in government spending The most direct means of increasing aggregate demand is an expansion of public spending . Providing the rates of taxation are not increased , an increase in government spending on goods and services has a direct effect on aggregate demand with the appropriate multiplier effects . This increased spending will raise income initially by the full amount of spending , whereas , as we have already noted , tax reductions of equivalent money value will not increase spending to the same extent since part of the addition to disposable income will be saved . Alternatively the government may increase its outlays by raising the levels of the various welfare benefits . Higher social security pay ments will have an immediate effect on demand . Since the bulk of such payments are received by persons with relatively high propensities to consume there would be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to raise the C + I + G line in Fig. 22 until full employment income 0 Yt is achieved . The increase in expendi ture required for this purpose is ab and the multiplier will be When the problem is one of excess demand at full employment in-come the measures discussed above can be put into reverse , but there are some serious problems associated with policies to increase taxation and reduce government spending . These are discussed in the next section . FISCAL POLICY-SOME PROBLEMS Fiscal policy , in common with other economic policy instruments , has its advantages and disadvantages . It has the advantage of being a very direct instrument . Changes in G and T will have immediate effects on aggregate demand , although the extent of these effects is rather uncertain because of likely changes in the propensity to consume . Fiscal policy may also be used in a dis criminatory manner to alter the allocation of resources both geo graphically and industrially . Government expenditure may be biased towards projects in development areas or towards certain industries ( e.g. coal-fired power stations instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firms locating themselves in development areas . The govern ment may decide to place heavier tax burdens on service industries // than manufacturing industries if it believes , for example , thak exports are mainly dependent upon the latter . A major use of fiscal policy is in the pursuit of social and political objectives , especially those which aim to reduce inequalities of wealth and opportunity . The application of progressive taxation to income and wealth , and the redistribution of the revenues in the form of social security benefits , will tend to reduce the extent of these inequalities . There are disadvantages . Some major part of government expenditure is geared to important social and political programmes which make for a high degree of inflexibility in a downward direction . Where the policy requirement is for a reduction of aggregate demand it will be difficult to make a substantial use of G for this purpose . Any reduction in the expenditures on education , health services , pensions and other social security measures will be very strongly resisted . Unless the situation is very critical , the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plans for expansion by postponing the implementation of certain programmes . This lack of flexibility in the short run is particularly applicable to public investment which is largely concerned with longterm projects such as road construction , school building , hospital building and so on . Such projects can not be switched on and off ' as a means of varying aggregate demand in the short period . The time interval between the decision to build new roads and the time when large-scale expenditure is actually undertaken may be a matter of years ? the planning and organising period will be a long one . Once the work is begun it will be difficult and costly to postpone or reschedule the work . Major changes in taxation also take a considerable time to implement since they usually involve an immense amount of administrative work . Some degree of flexibility does exist in the form of the regulator ' whereby the Chancellor of the Exchequer has power to vary the rates of indirect tax either way by up to 10 per cent between Budgets . Fiscal policy is a powerful instrument of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tuning ' ? major changes can not be carried out more frequently than once a year . The effectiveness of tax changes has also been seriously questioned in recent years . While tax reductions will certainly increase consumer spending their effectiveness as a stimulant to private investment is more uncertain . Much depends upon the climate of business expectations . Recent British experience has shown that tax reductions on quite a massive scale can fail to produce a major increase in private investment when businessmen are not optimistic about future prospects . Increases in taxes aimed at reducing aggregate demand may also affect aggregate supply if they have unfavourable effects on the incentives to work and invest . In this respect direct taxes such as income tax and // profits ax are more likely to have such disincentive effects . The se of indirect taxation as a means of restricting demand creates problenps because such taxes affect prices and an increase in the general price level is almost certain to provoke reaction by organised labour . The proved effectiveness of union action in obtaining compensating wage increases when the cost of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in indirect taxes as a means of restraining demand . THE BALANCED BUDGET MULTIPLIER An increase in government spending on goods and services financed by a corresponding increase in direct taxation will not leave national income unchanged . The fact that G and Twill have increased by equal amounts does not mean that injections and withdrawals also increase by equal amounts . Even with a balanced budget , the State can still bring about an expansion of aggregate demand . This is possible because the expansionary effects of the government spending are greater than the downward multiplier effects of the increased taxation . If we assume a closed economy in which investment is autonomous and the MPC of the community is less than 1 , it can be shown that an increase in govern-ment spending on goods and services financed entirely by direct taxation will lead to an increase in national income equal to the increase in G. In other words , in this particular case , the balanced budget multiplier is 1 . Suppose that the MPC i s - , so that s of any income received leaks out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each ? 1 of income received , therefore , 60p will be spent on domestic output and generate a further increase in income . Now if government spending on goods and services is increased by ? lm. a sequence of spending rounds will be set in motion as follows . If , at the same time , direct taxes are increased so as to raise revenue by ? 1000000 , the immediate effect is to reduce disposable income by ? 1000 000 . Consumption spending will change initially by ? ? 600 000 and this will set up a downward multiplier sequence as follows . // Income will eventually change by The net change in national income therefore will be Income has increased by an amount equal to the change in government expenditure ; i.e. The reason for this , of course , is that the government will be collecting in taxation some income which would otherwise have leaked out of the circular flow of income , but it will be spending all of this income . Some of the income now taken in taxation would have been saved had it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will be spent . If the government expenditure had been devoted to increased transfer payments the results would have been quite different . If the recipients of the transfer payments had the same MPCs as the taxpayers there would have been no multiplier effects . The group receiving an increase in disposable income would dispose of it in the same manner as the taxpayers would have disposed of it had they been allowed to do so . FISCAL POLICY AND THE NATIONAL DEBT The use of fiscal policy has important implications in respect of the national debt . Where the government is increasing its expenditure but not increasing taxation , or where it is holding its expenditure but reducing taxation , it must be obtaining the necessary funds by borrowing . It will be running a budget deficit , and , in so doing , increasing the national debt . Like any firm or household , a government can not spend money it does not have . To finance a deficit the government must borrow by selling bonds to households , firms and banks . Is the National Debt a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much confusion because many people view it in the same light as a private debt . When a firm or household borrows , it incurs a liability in that interest payments on the debt and its eventual repayment will involve a real loss of resources by that household or firm . When the government borrows internally ( i.e. from domestic lenders ) the community as a whole does not incur any liability . Interest payments to bondholders and the repayment of the debt simply involve transfers of funds from some members of the national community ( taxpayers or purchasers of new bonds ) to other members of the same community ( holders of maturing bonds ) . The internal national debt may be compared to borrowing within a family . If one brother // borrow ? 5 from another brother , the wealth and income of the family is in no ay affected . Any hart of the national debt which is owed to foreign citizens , however does constitute a national burden . Interest payments and capital repayments to foreigners represent claims on the resources of the home country ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaving fewer goods for consumption at home . Does borrowing transfer the burden ? A common misconception with regard to the national debt is that the burden of current government spending is in some way transferred to future generations . The construction of roadworks which is financed by selling bonds due for repayment , say , in 25 years ' time will sometimes be condemned as unfair ' because the repayment of this debt places the burden of meeting the cost of current road construction on a future generation of citizens . This is not the case at all . The real cost of constructing roads is borne by the community undertaking the work . The true cost of these roads is the desirable foregone alternative uses of the resources . Resources committed to building roads might have been used to build houses , power stations , technical colleges and so on . The opportunity cost of the new roads should be seen in terms of the sacrifice of alternatives incurred at the time the resources were committed . The debt inherited by future generations will not be a cost ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community . Can we have a perpetual public debt ? The government does not have to worry about paying off the existing debt since it makes no call on the nation 's resources . When a particular loan is due for repayment the government can make a new issue of bonds and use the proceeds to repay the holders of the maturing bonds . The debt may last forever provided the government raises sufficient revenue to cover the interest payments . In this respect the total interest cost must be judged against the size of the GNP since this is the total tax base . Using this comparison it can be seen that the very large national debt of the UK is a smaller burden ' than the very much smaller pre-war national debt . Does a large national debt have any unfavourable effect ? A large national debt presents the government with the task of raising large sums of money to meet the interest charges . These charges have to be met out of tax revenues and they may be a cause of the tax burden reaching levels which have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to an undesirable ' redistribution of income from the lower income groups to the higher income groups . This would // be the case if bonds were held mainly by wealthier groups ad taxes paid mainly by lower income groups . Heavy government borrowing through large sales of securities is likely to drive down the prices of securities and raise the rate of interest . This could have harmful effects on investment . If we assume that there is some upper limit to the tax burden that a government is prepared to impose , the heavy interest charges of a large national debt may restrict the government 's ability to carry out or expand some of its programmes in such fields as education , roads , hospitals , etc. 102 10 Foreign Trade and National Income Exports and imports It is now time to introduce another sector into our model of the economic system . We have proceeded to this present stage of the analysis using a closed ' system ; that is , an economy with no flows of goods and services from within its borders to other nations and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find such an economy in the real world , and we must now take account of the relationship between a country 's international transactions and its national income . In Chapter 3 it was explained that exports constitute an injection into and imports a leakage from the circular flow of income . We now have to examine the determinants of export and import demands just as , in previous chapters , we have looked at the determinants of consumption and investment demand . The first point to make is that we are interested in the creation of demand and not the meeting of a demand . Imports help to meet a home demand , but they do not make any demand on home resources ? they do not generate income at home . The demand for imports , therefore , is subtracted from total demand in order to calculate the demand for home resources that makes up the national expenditure . Exports , on the other hand , do contribute to aggregate demand for domestic output . Export demand , for purposes of analysis , will be treated as autonomous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determined independently of the level of income and output . It will be the state of world trade ? the level of overall demand in world markets ? which will determine the level of a country 's exports . Movements in the real incomes of the importing countries and the extent of the barriers to international trade ( tariffs , quotas , etc. ) are obviously important factors in this respect . Exports will also be affected by the relationship between movements in home prices and movements in world prices and this is a point dealt with later in the chapter on Foreign Exchange . Import demand by contrast will be related to movements in the // national income . As domestic output rises or falls we must eipect the imports of raw materials , semi-finished goods , fuels and machinery to rise and fall in the same manner . As incomes increase or ; decrease imports of finished goods will probably move in the same direction . Imports , too , will be affected by changes in the country 's policy with regard to tariffs and other restrictions on international @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is also an important determinant of the level of imports ? again , this is a matter for subsequent discussion . Equilibrium ? an open economy For an open economy the equilibrium equation , as demonstrated in Chapter 3 , is Y=C+I+G+ ( X ? M ) The brackets placed round ( X ? M ) draw attention to the fact that the difference between them ( which may be positive or negative ) is the balance of payments on current account . ' The equation may be rearranged as follows , Y ? ( C + I + G ) = X ? M This shows that the balance of payments position is directly related to national income and domestic spending . The balance on current account is equal to the national income minus public and private spending on consumption and investment . There is , in fact , a two-way relationship . Changes in exports and imports affect income , and changes in income affect the balance of payments account . This is explained later . The equation above refers to the equilibrium level of income . It tells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ output at constant prices . The balance of payments introduces the idea of an external equilibrium where the expenditure on imports is exactly equal to the revenue from exports at constant prices . There does not appear to be any reason why the conditions necessary for internal equilibrium should produce an equilibrium situation in the current balance of payments . This may be clearer if we look at the equilibrium level of income from the point of view of planned leakages and planned injections . Planned spending = C+ I+ G + X ? M Planned output ( = income ) = C + S + T 1 . The current account covers most transactions in goods and services , it does not include capital items . ( See pages 200-1 ) . // Equilibrium requires , C+ I + G + X ? M = C + S + T ; i.e. I+G+X = S+T+M ( Injections ) ( Leakages ) It can be seen that there is no need for any pair of injections and leakages to be equal . Savings need not equal investment , government spending need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equal to exports . The requirement is that total leakages equal total injections . For example , the following values provide an overall equilibrium but there will be deficits on the government account and on the balance of payments . I G X S , T M 100 + 100 + 50 100 + 75 + 75 In the long run a government must achieve an equilibrium situation in its international transactions and this will entail the use of measures explained in Chapter 18 . In the meantime we should note that the task of obtaining equilibrium conditions in the markets for goods and services at home ( i.e. stable prices ) , in the labour market ( i.e. full employment ) and in the balance of payments ( i.e. X = M ) will obviously present the government with major problems . It is most likely that the pursuit of any one objective , say , full employment , will conflict with the objectives of achieving the other goals . Foreign trade and the multiplier Just as we can project a schedule showing the relationship between consumption and income so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ income . If we relate movements in imports to movements in income we obtain the propensity to import or the import function . The average propensity to import will give us the level of imports associated with any given level of income and may be represented by M Y. The marginal propensity to import ( MPM or m ) will tell us what proportion of any increase in income will be spent on foreign goods and services and may be represented by AM AY . For example , if , when Yincrease by 100 , M increases by 10 , the marginal propensity to import is 04 . This MPM is an important concept since it // indicates how much of a change in our national income will be transmitted to other countries through variations in our purchases of their goods and services . Similarly exports will be dependent upon the rest of the world 's propensity to import . The marginal propensity to import is a part of the marginal rate of leakage and , as such , will influence the size of the multiplier . Moving from a closed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( imports ) and hence reduced the size of the multiplier . The import leakage means that a smaller proportion of any increase in income is now passed on to generate further increases in income . The multiplier expression must now be adjusted to take account of imports . The multiplier = 1 1 s + t + m marginal rate of leakage where s = marginal propensity to save t = marginal rate of taxation m = marginal propensity to import . Note that this multiplier applies to any autonomous change in spending . Thus , changes in the levels of exports , investment , government spending or autonomous consumption will all have multiplier effects on income . The introduction of an international sector has given us a foreign trade multiplier since changes in exports will have magnified effects on national income . + Planned Injections and Leakages Y VI DX oY // Income changes and foreign trade Fig. 23 shows the aggregate leakages and aggregate injections for an open economy . W is the total leakage function and is obtained by adding together the schedules of savings , imports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obtained by adding together the investment , exports and government spending schedules . Initially equilibrium is at O Y , where planned injections equal planned leakages . Now assume that exports increase X to X ' . The planned injection line rises to J ' and the new equilibrium level of income will be established at 0 Y ' . The multiplier , which is the eventual increase in income divided by the originating change in spending , is AY AX Several important points emerge from the foregoing analysis . ( a ) Earlier analysis established that one of the main causes of instability in the level of income and output was the variability of private investment . The introduction of foreign trade has now added another cause of instability ? changes in the level of exports . The foreign trade multiplier is a most important relationship for those countries , such as the UK , where exports account for a large percentage of total output ( i.e. 20 per cent or more ) . A rise in exports , through the multiplier effects , can be the cause of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but , equally , a substantial fall in exports can lead a country into a recession . ( b ) Changes in the level of income will have effects on the balance of payments . The nature of these effects depends on whether the change in income arises from internal or external causes . If there is a rise in export sales , due , perhaps , to trade liberalisation measures , domestic incomes will rise until the increase in planned injections has been matched by an increase in planned leakages . But only part of this increase in leakages will be due to increased imports ; savings and tax revenues will also rise . Hence exports will rise by more than imports and the balance of payments will improve ' . Conversely the multiplier effects of a fall in exports would reduce income , and imports would fall by a smaller amount than exports . The balance of payments would worsen ' . When the change in income arises from causes which have a domestic origin , the effects will be different . An increase in income brought about by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position since imports would increase while exports remain unchanged . The reverse would apply when investment ( or government spending ) fell . ( c ) The analysis so far has ignored foreign repercussions of changes in country 's exports and imports . If a country is a major exporter and // The Multiplier Round Increase in income = ? 100.00 Retained profits and surpluses ( 10% ) = ? 10.00 Personal income = ? 90.00 Direct taxes ( 25% ) = ? 22.50 Personal disposable income = ? 67.50 Saving ( 10% ) = ? 6.75 Consumption at market prices = ? 60.75 Imports ( 20% ) = ? 12.15 Indirect taxes ( 18% ) = ? 10.90 Consumption of domestic product = ? 37.70 Fig. 24 importer ( i.e. it accounts for a significant proportion of world trade ) , there are likely to be feedback ' effects whenever its exports or imports change substantially . Let us suppose that A stands for the home country and B for the rest of the world ( or those countries trading with A ) . Now assume that A 's income @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the propensity to consume . The rise in A 's income will bring about an increase in its imports from B , and B 's income will rise . This increase in B 's income will tend to increase its imports from A. There will be a // further rise in A 's income and a further rise in its imports from B. And so the process will go on until the multiplier effects have worked themselves out . The dimensions of these effects will depend upon the respective marginal propensities to import and the extent of the savings and taxation leakages . Again we must note that these changes can work in the opposite direction with multiplier effects downwards . There will also be international feedback effects arising from any autonomous changes in A 's exports . Suppose A 's exports increase due to an increasing preference for its products in B. Now the rise in B 's imports will cause its income to fall and this will tend to reduce its imports from A. But the initial increase in A 's exports will have increased its income through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tend to increase . This will offset to some extent the fall in B 's income . The ultimate effects will again depend upon the marginal propensities to consume and the magnitude of the multiplier effects in each sector . We have ignored the possibilities of changes in the prices of exports and imports and concentrated on the real income effects . In fact , price changes are an important element in the adjustment processes in the real world . In certain circumstances countries will resort to a deliberate policy of changing the relative prices of exports and imports ( devaluation ) rather than allow an equilibrium situation to arise through income changes . We discuss these matters in Chapter 18 . Fig. 24 gives very approximate values for the multiplier round in the British economy . What is the value of the multiplier ? Some worked examples 1 . In a closed economy , net investment expenditure is at the rate of ? 1000m . APC = MPC = 0.8 of disposable income . There is no government activity .

Since this is a closed economwith no overnment activit The multiplier is the reciprocal of the sum of the leakages ( expressed as fractions of income ) . In this case the only leakage is savings . The multiplier therefore When APC and MPC fall from 5 to 5 , then APS and MPS increase from s to 5 . The immediate effect is that Planned Savings Planned Investment . But adjustments of income will take place until Planned injections = Planned leakages ; i.e. Investment = Savings Since investment does not change 3 .

This is , perhaps , rather surprising since the earning and spending of money are essential , and most obvious features of economic activity in the modern world . A study of the monetary aspects of the economy has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minor importance , but because it is the production and distribution of goods and services which determine the material welfare of the community . Similarly it is the stock of real assets ? houses , factories , machines , stocks of materials and the like ? which comprise the real wealth of the nation . We have concentrated on output , because it is the flow of real income per unit of time which determines the standard of living . Nevertheless we know that income and wealth are given monetary values , and it is this which gives rise to the common confusion between money and wealth . Money gives people a command over goods and services , and its possession represents wealth to the extent of the goods and services for which it can be exchanged . It is not money itself but the things it will buy which represent wealth . A nation can not grow richer by creating more money since money is merely a claim to things and , if there are not more things to claim , more money can not make people as a whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inventions ? it is impossible to imagine the operation of an advanced industrial society without money . The fact that all but the most primitive societies make use of money indicates that it is an essential tool of civilisation . Money has been described as a kind of lubricant which greatly increases the efficiency of the economic mechanism . If this were its only role we would not have to spend long on the subject ; it would only be necessary to describe its effectiveness as a device for facilitating exchange transactions . Unfortunately money is not a passive or neutral element in the economic system . It exerts a powerful independent influence on the real macroeconomic variables we have been discussing ? consumption , investment , 119
