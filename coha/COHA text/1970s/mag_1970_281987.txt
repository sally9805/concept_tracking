When The Shadow of Sound , a small volume of poetry , went on sale in Moscow a few weeks ago , the first shipment of 10,000 copies was sold out within two hours . That frenzied response was merely one more proof of the excitement that is generated by Andrei Voznesensky , who at 37 is among the best-and most talked about-of the Soviet Union 's younger poets . <P> Since he first began to publish his poetry twelve years ago , Voznesensky has been sharply rebuked by Nikita Khrushchev and dismissed by conservative critics as a " formalist " -a derogatory term for a Soviet writer who allows himself to become preoccupied with experimentation rather than socialist realism . And he has frequently tussled with officialdom over censorship . His controversial stage revue , Look Out for Your Faces ( TIME , March 9 ) , an exuberant plea for individuality and self-expression , was ordered closed in February after only two performances . But his widespread popularity as the voice of a new Soviet generation has clearly survived undiminished . " His main quality is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an introduction to the new volume . " The books of Voznesensky are always a depot of metaphors . " <P> The Shadow of Sound is also a depot - or perhaps a birdcage-for a series of picture poems in which words are arranged in the shapes of their subjects . The poet , for instance , ends a sun-washed reverie ( " I love to enter the aureole of light/where there are no boundaries " ) with the image : " The seagull is the bikini of God . " Then he recasts these words to form a picture poem ( see cut ) . <P> One of the volume 's best poems , The Grove , * translated by R.A.D. Ford , Canadian Ambassador to Moscow and a poet in his own right , is an ode to the natural world in flight from man , who would destroy it : <P> Do n't touch man , little tree , do n't start a fire in him . So many things go on in him- Oh God , save him from that ! <P> Do n't shoot man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In your shade below is silence . So painful is the unknown . <P> An inexperienced two-legged friend . You , mink and sable , Strip the traps from the trail , so you do n't harm your soul . <P> The past should not poach on him . He is not guilty of that . No need , free copse , no need , to be jealous of his homes . <P> You stand in such easy shade , reaching up to the eye-brows- At least You do n't kill with love . <P> Give back to him on Sunday all the berries and mushrooms . Grant him salvation , with salvation destroy him . <P> <P> *Copyright 1970 by R.A.D. Ford .
