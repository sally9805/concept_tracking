txt The word that we would be released came to us on June 9 in a rather casual way . To our pleasure , we had been taken out to the woods before dawn that day . That meant we could get some sun , walk around a bit , and enjoy the trees and the birds . There was a tiny thatch but we could sit in that housed several sacks of rice . In the afternoon we heard helicopters approaching and quickly pulled into the but the wet clothes that were spread out so as not to draw attention to our position . The tea kettle was black and therefore posed no problem . The white dishes had already been put under a bush and covered with an additional branch or two . The but itself had had foliage put over it at one time . But these branches had long since browned and withered , leaving a rectangle of thatch that might easily become visible from the air if rotors were close enough to agitate the branches of the tall trees above us . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were four helicopters , and they were working over our immediate area , descending and rising in a pattern as they searched the woods . They were not shooting  --  yet  --  but the but was a likely target if they saw it . In one breathing space the three of us had scrambled under the raised floor of the hut  --  under the rice sacks  --  but this would have been no protection if the helicopters had fired their rockets . // ? *Last days of captivity and a farewell dinner // One of our guards , Ba , feared the worst as two of the helicopters , which were maneuvering at a distance of about 80 meters from the but and at an altitude of only 40 meters , were indeed sweeping the high foliage in a way that might reveal the hut . He therefore ran through the woods to the far side of the helicopters , shot his M-16 into the air , and ran in the other direction to divert the pilots away from the hut . Diversion tactic tried Hai and Tu , who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us when the helicopters approached , independently ran to the same area that Ba did , also to draw the aircraft away . Ba next circled back to us and moved us , with great urgency , to a camouflaged glade in another section of the woods . Then he disappeared to reconnoiter further . Ban Tun stayed with us , giving us fresh branches to cover ourselves with in case the helicopters should return  --  and also giving us some wild oranges he had discovered en route . When Ba came back to the glade once more , he explained that we would now have to leave the area that night , unexpectedly . The safest way to leave was to walk , and he made sure that we were all in good health and that none of us had any foot trouble . We assured him that we were feeling very well and that we could walk a long distance with no difficulty . Instructions repeated " No matter what happens , do n't run , " Ba said , repeating an instruction he had given us at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ command . We feared the helicopters as much as everyone else did . ) Now Ba added what he had not said before : " I have a pistol here , and in a dangerous situation I could shoot You . . . . I am letting you know , no matter what happens I would not do that . But if you brought the American helicopters here , it would make much difficulty for the friends that live here . " I want to see you back with your families . . . I just want them to see you face to face again . ' ? The officer in charge We told him that we would never run , and he nodded , adding that he did not say much , but he saw a great deal , and he knew this was the case . " I want you to live , " he said , " I want to see you safely back with your families ... . I just want them to see you face to face again .... Sooner or later you will be released @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a high commander in the region who informed us officially that we would be released soon . No more than half an hour later we said goodbye to the Cambodian family we had been staying with and began our long last night walk . Some niceties remained . There was our formal and polemical interview with a Cambodian introduced as the regional commander . There was one photograph of us with packs and hats standing with Ban Tun , who had just been promoted to officer . ( We asked to have copies mailed to us . ) There was one brief recording session in which Dick read the joint statement we had been asked to write about our treatment and impressions . Mike read an article he had written about high morale among the pro-Communist and pro-Sihanouk front troops ? and a dog yowled inconsolably in the background , ( I was recorded in French at the interview when I thanked the commander for the interview and for the hospitality and good treatment we had received in Cambodia . ) There was a gala good-bye dinner at which just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks showed up . Chess set accepted And there was one session which Mike , Dick , and I initiated in which we gave modest presents from our own belongings to our five escorts . They would not accept anything we had brought to Cambodia with us , but they did accept the chess set . In doing so , they said they would always remember our whittling it . We were scheduled to be released on June 14 and on that afternoon set out across the fields to meet a vehicle . To our surprise , the vehicle turned out to be a full-fledged taxibus . To our further surprise , we took a main road full of people , an unprecedented event . To our final surprise , we turned into a village schoolyard where a celebration was beginning . There was a gathering of about 1,000 villagers ; there was an honor guard of Cambodian irregulars ; and there were new banners that were translated for us as thanking American people who oppose aggression by the Nixon administration in Cambodia . We were shown places at a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a speech given in Cambodian over the loudspeaker system that was not translated for us . At one point our names were announced , although we did not seem to constitute the focus of the speech . At the end I was asked to thank the assemblage in French . I said  --  sincerely  --  that we appreciated greatly the hospitality of the homes we had stayed in . Then the heavens unloosed a monsoon torrent and the crowds fled . The rain made travel difficult on mud roads , so we changed our plans and returned to our last house , rousing the family , which had already retired for the night . Wang ( the guard who had done most of the cooking ) had bought some pastry in the village . We dried out over tea and pastry , and we wondered what Hai , Tu , and Ban Tun , who had quit our party that day , might be doing n inge . xt afternoon and night we traveled by jeep and a relay of motorbikes to a part of Highway 1 controlled at night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and money that the soldiers had given us to make sure we could get back to Saigon . The following morning we hitched a ride with an empty South Vietnamese convoy that was returning from Phnom Penh to Saigon . Our Cambodian sojourn was at an end .
