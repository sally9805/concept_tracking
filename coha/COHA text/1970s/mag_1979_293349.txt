Carter increases pressure against threat of spy trials <P> For five long weeks they have been held under threat of death in the U.S. embassy in Tehran . Their arms have been bound , and they have been forbidden to speak to one another . Their captors have subjected them to intense questioning , and even threatened some of them at gunpoint . All the while , crowds of fanatical followers of the Ayatullah Ruhollah Khomeini have demonstrated outside the embassy walls . <P> Last week a climax to the hostages ' ordeal , by either their trial or release , seemed closer . Iran 's Foreign Minister Sadegh Ghotbzadeh told Western reporters that " as soon as possible " the government would announce the hostages ' fate . Many will be released , he said , but an undisclosed number will be tried as spies . The trials will be conducted by the same revolutionary tribunals that have sentenced some 630 Iranians to execution . Said Ghotbzadeh : " Those who can be proved not to have consciously engaged in espionage will be freed . " Asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death , Ghotbzadeh replied : " I hope we do n't reach that point .

Explained a top Administration official : " We are trying to say , ' Look , world , nobody has seen the hostages . We do n't know what is happening to them . ' " Vice President Walter Mondale complained that " even prisoners of war are guaranteed certain standards of human treatment , but these standards are being dragged in the dirt . " Rosalynn Carter voiced the same refrain in campaign appearances for her husband in Washington , New York City and Jackson , Miss. , calling the captives " hostages of a mob and a government that have become one and the same . " Secretary of State Cyrus Vance demanded that Iran permit neutral doctors to examine the hostages .
