THE TALK OF THE TOWN Notes and Comp/lent JIMMY CARTER 'S staff has reported that he is deeply concerned about losing contact with the people he has been elected to serve . He is so concerned , in fact , that his office has established a special mailing address for those who want to send in suggestions that might help him keep in touch with his constituents . The problem is acute , and his desire to do something about it is commendable . We submit our proposals herewith . For one , Mr. Carter could ask to be addressed not as " Mr. President " but simply as " Mr. Carter . " When the title " Mr. President " was adopted , in an age of potentates , it must have seemed modestly democratic , but surely the most powerful man on earth today does n't need any title at all . If Mr. Carter were to get rid of this one , it might remind him that , while he is the first citizen in the land , he is still merely a citizen  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campaign for the Presidency , to he . He could also break some other traditions that tend to insulate Presidents from the citizenry . At White House banquets in the past , for instance , Presidents have sat down at table with generous campaign contributors , powerful financiers , leaders of special-interest groups , influential politicians , and celebrities from the worlds of science and the arts . These are people who usually know little about their country , for their positions tend to insulate them from their fellow-men and from the realities of the ordinary person 's lot . In place of such luminaries , Mr. Carter might invite workers , housewives , students , small businessmen , farmers , bus drivers , public-school teachers , waiters , and salesmen , and impose on them only one condition  --  that they speak honestly to him about their views of America 's problems and of his proposed solutions . Then , to get a more personal impression of the lives of the people in this country , Mr. Carter could visit some of them  --  say , once a month  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ random in some city or town or village , who could sit down quietly with him in the house of one of them and talk for an evening . Mr. Carter could also ask more broadly experienced men and women around the country whom he knows well , whose judgment he trusts , and who seek no private advantage to come to the White House occasionally , one by one and without publicity , to tell him what they hear and what they think about his stewardship of the nation . If they want nothing from him , they would have nothing to fear from him , and could speak freely about what seems to be going on beneath the surface of our society . A close aide of Mr. Carter 's recently attributed the decrease in his contact with the public to the increase in protection provided by the Secret Service after he was nominated and the further increase after he was elected . It was , the aide said , becoming difficult to maintain " relations with the outside world , which is getting more and more remote . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that matter , a candidate  --  establishes contact with people by shaking hands with them in a crowd or by chatting with them for a few moments or by riding past them in a limousine or by kissing babies is nonsense . Appearances like these may Feed a candidate 's or a President 's already inflated sense of self-importance , but they do nothing to keep him in touch with the public . As a matter of fact , this kind of contact reduces true contact by deceiving him into believing that he is close to the public when he is actually more remote than ever . The radio " fireside chat , " which was used by Franklin Roosevelt , and which Mr. Carter has promised to revive , would do far more for the people themselves ; that is , it would at least keep them in touch with him . The " imperial Presidency " has , to a large extent , grown out of the immense power  --  mainly military power  --  developed by this nation since the Second World War . When that war began , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below Portugal 's and barely above Bulgaria 's . Although our military establishment is essential to our freedom , it is basically undemocratic in nature and should be kept in its place . Most of all , the ceremony surrounding it should be limited , for the symbol of armed might is an affront to a nation that preaches peace . Albert Jay Nock , in his character study of Jefferson , wrote , " Economy furnished Mr. Jefferson a good pretext for indulging his inveterate dislike of ceremonial formalities .... As President , he made a clean sweep of levees , parades , reviews , and public functions of a decorative character . These things cost money . " They also cost our democracy some of its plain dignity . The military honor guard that is trotted out every time a foreign head of state pays an official visit to Washington may have been excusable when our youthful Republic felt a need to flex its tiny biceps , but it is an absurd and swaggering exercise today , when our power terrifies even us . If Mr. Carter wants to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do better to introduce foreign heads of state to the officer who always accompanies him carrying a small black box that contains codes for setting off a nuclear attack . Rather than go through the pointless formality of " reviewing " ranks of rigid servicemen , Mr. Carter and his visitors could greet assemblages of common citizens invited , again at random , off the streets . Tradition has it that we must show respect to the President as a mark of our respect for the Presidency . This , too , is nonsense . Presidents should be respected when they deserve it . We have seen what mindless respect for the Presidency brought us in the case of President Nixon , who was allowed to stay in office long after he should have been impeached or forced to resign . Despite his flagrant skullduggery , he would probably have completed his second term  --  possibly at mortal cost to the nation  --  if he had n't been discovered with the " smoking revolver " in his hand . In fact , it was doubtless his belief that public respect for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that led Nixon to indulge in such lawless behavior in the first place . To help reduce the Presidency to more democratic proportions , the tradition of playing " Hail to the Chief " at White House ceremonies might also be dispensed with . Renditions of this Presidential anthem may be suitable for the lunacy of a National Convention , but it is a shoddy imitation of " God Save the King/Queen " and we could well do without it . In German , it would be called " Heil dem Fii h rer . " Above all , though , every possible means should be used to remind Mr. Carter that , for all his power and glory , he is no more than a man who has been chosen as a temporary occupant of the highest office in the nation . James Burnham , editor of the National Review , once remarked , " Every man who has become President in our time sooner or later has come to feel that he does not merely represent the people but that he is the people . When that happens , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vicious attack on the people  --  in short , as treason . " It was this devastating hubris that brought on Vietnam and Watergate , destroyed two Presidents , and nearly wrecked our country . Mr. Carter seems far different from those predecessors  --  an extraordinary man who is also a plain man . We hope that he will preserve these wondrous qualities and remain himself  --  not an imperial President but a leader and a follower of the people . ? ? Rehearsals WHEN an opera disappears from the stage for nearly fifty years , there is usually a good reason for its absence . Giacomo Meyerheer 's " Le Prophete , " which was revived by the Metropolitan Opera last Tuesday , is a classic case in point . Written in the early eighteen-forties , at the very beginning of " grand " opera , it requires seven big , flexible , wide-ranging voices , an exceptionally large orchestra , eight elaborate sets , a company of dancers capable of performing the famous ice ballet ( which was originally given on roller skates ) , and an audience willing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fireworks and blood-and-thunder histrionics . We watched a couple of " Prophete " rehearsals recently and can report that the new , streamlined version  --  directed by John Dexter , designed by Peter Wexler , and conducted by Henry Lewis  --  is a galvanic , tightly paced political melodrama in three acts , with unexpected Freudian overtones . The theme is religious fanaticism during the Protestant Reformation . ( The hero , Jean de Leyde , becomes convinced that God has chosen him to lead an Anabaptist revolt against the city of Miinster . After he is crowned prophet-king in the Miinster cathedral , Jean 's love-hate relationship with his mother , Fides , causes his downfall . ) The production combines abstract sets ( the basic visual element is a skeletal Gothic cathedral ) with vividly realistic characters , must of whom seem to have stepped out of a Bruegel painting . ( The three Anabaptists , who are learned men , are patterned after Holbein or Diirer . ) The movable scenery consists of nine roughhewn wooden wagons and a couple of vestigial staircases , all of which are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a city square , a banquet hall , and so on . The score is eclectic and intensely theatrical  --  Meyerbeer is not in the Mozart-Verdi league , but lie influenced everybody from Brahms to Offenbach  --  and the characters , as they are developed by Dexter , possess a blazing sense of life which is rare in opera . ( Jean and the Anabaptists are historical personages ; Fides is presumably based on Meyer-beer 's strong-willed , devout moth er . ) Our initial encounter with " ProphZte " took place in a basement rehearsal room , where John Dexter , a compact Englishman who has snapping brown eyes , a neat salt-and-pepper mustache and heard , and a cheerfully ferocious disposition , was rehearsing a scene in which ( l ) Jean hides his fiancee , Berthe. , from the lecherous Count Oberthal , ( 2 ) the Count demands Berthe in exchange for the life of Jean 's mother , Fides , and ( 3 ) Berthe gives herself Lip to save Fides . Three wagons had been transformed into a table at an inn ; a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hiding place . With Henry Lewis conducting from beside the piano , Berthe ( Renata Scotto ) dashed across the room to the staircase and disappeared ; Count Oberthal ( Morley Meredith ) ordered Jean ( James McCracken ) to produce her and Fides ( Marilyn Horne ) was dragged in by two soldiers and forced to kneel with their swords pointed at her neck . The singers were not rehearsing full nut , because they had not learned all the words , and because the microsecond timing of the action gave everybody trouble . " We might even do a little nick of Mama just to make the audience realize it 's serious , " said Mr. Dexter , moving the sword points closer to Miss Home 's throat , and showing her how to clutch her rosary in anguish . " Remember , you 're not commanding Jean to sacrifice you . You leave it up to him . Happy martyr . Then Renata takes over from there . The main thing now is to get the text out of the way . It 's driving you all crazy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're in that state . " " You know , " said Mr. McCracken , a stocky , commanding tenor who has strong features and an aureole of fluffy white hair , " I 'm beginning to think that Jean goes along with the Anabaptists because he wants vengeance on the people who have taken his bride away . I think my vision in this scene is a fake . " " Not at all , " said Mr. Dexter . " Look at the words and you 'll see Jean is already halfway round the twist . " " He sure has that vision at an opportune moment , " said Mr. McCracken . " Joan of Arc always heard her voices at just the right time , too , " said Mr. Dexter . " When we get you into the cathedral for the Coronation Scene , we 'll convince you that you 're God 's chosen prophet . " Three weeks later , we returned to the Met to find " Prophete " being rehearsed on the main stage . The principals were letter-perfect in their lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bodices and layers of skirts for the women , medieval hose and short jerkins for the men  --  and Mr. Dexter was transforming its members from passive peasants into a revolutionary mob . " The weather is good and it 's your half hour off , " Mi ? Dexter said to ? ? eighty-odd men and women who were sprawled across the stage ready to sing . " Do n't let the eating and drinking relax , and do n't be too French  --  it 's vulgar and Flemish we want . Watch the pots along the front ; one fell into the pit yesterday and made the orchestra a bit nervous . " As three Anabaptists in black robes appeared at the hack of the stage , Mr. Dexter encouraged his peasants to react as individuals . " First , you 're apprehensive and astonished , " he said . " Too frightened to move . Then you 're curious . And finally they convince you . " The Anabaptists preached their revolutionary doctrine from three small platforms at the front of the stage , and Mr. Dexter brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , their heads thrown back and their arms outstretched . " The gesture is grab  --  give me , " he said , flinging up his arms and spreading his fingers . " Now run out , get the hayrakes and the scythes , and come back as fast as you can . " Mr. Dexter went through the remainder of the first act , pausing to revise a costume ( " Renata looks too much like Giselle . She should be dirtier " ) , restage a piece of action ( " Jimmy , put your face in your hands and then look up and out to tell them about that terrifying dream " ) , and work out an intricate set change ( " We 've got eighteen seconds to get three wagons into the center as a platform and take three more offstage , and I 've got to move eighty people out of the way so that Jimmy can sing Roi du ciel ' " ) . When the first act had reached its triumphant conclusion with the assault on Miinster , we followed Mr. Dexter down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him why he had chosen to revive this particular opera . " If there 's any thread in my work over the last twelve years  --  from ' The Royal Hunt of the Sun ' to Equus ' ? it 's a fascination with religion , with this teasing out of the relationship between man and God , " he said . " People often dismiss Prophete ' as a piece de theatre , but I think the work exists on a much more profound level . As a Jew , Meyerbeer was absolutely fascinated and appalled by the idiotic things Christians do to each other in the name of their God . In Prophete ' he tried to capture , musically and dramatically , the explosive atmosphere of Northern Europe in the fifteen-thirties  --  a time when the movement for a populist , instinctive religion had reached the boiling point . Revolution was in the air , because the literary humanists in the Catholic Church had tried without much success to absorb and define what , for the people , was a purely emotional thing . So people heard voices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Everybody in this opera is a fanatic , and at the same time there is a strangeness about the characters which gives them an extra dimension . Take jean  --  a simple innkeeper who actually comes to believe he 's God . How does it happen ? And then , in the cathedral , he comes face to face with his own humanity in the shape of his mother , and he 's trapped right through to the end . When you lay on top of that those extraordinary Anabaptists  --  I 've come to think of our trio as Marx , Trotsky , and Lenin ; a thinker , an activist , and a spiritual leader  --  you have a very complex canvas indeed . The set began as a half-built cathedral , but it has become a kind of Gothic cage , because that 's what Northern Europe was at the time ; the Church was a cage , and everybody was trapped inside it . I first thought of staging the opera as a morality play , using the theatrical devices of the period  --  no curtain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forth . Now I see these ideas as a springboard for presenting Jean , Berth ; Fides , and the Anabaptists as the fanatics they arc against a map of the world in which they live . " Coming to the Point T was halftime at the Central Gym up at West Point at five o'clock of a January Saturday afternoon when at last our friend the old curmudgeon began to talk . The Rabblerousers  --  the local term for the Army cheerleaders  --  were stirring up a fearsome din in the bleachers , but , as always , the o.c. ' s words cut cleanly through the hubbub of the moment . Princeton was three up over Army , 30-27 , and the players on the basketball court were two teams of quite well-behaved young women . The curmudgeon , an old Princetonian himself ( class of ' 22 ) , had been impartial throughout . " I like it up here , " lie said . " In the first place , a lot of the sporting events up here are free to anyone who happens by , just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Massachusetts or in my favorite town in the Cotswolds . This is hometown America . Look at the customers  --  they 're town and gown , happily melded . In the second place , it 's a Colonial town , or dates back almost that far . American Colonial-style houses , English collegiate Gothic . As for a town green , there 's one practically everywhere you turn . But what 's most important to me today is that here 's old Army thoughtfully carrying on a tradition of the dear old Sargent School , in Boston , where , in the days when women tennis players wore skirts that revealed no more than a hare hint of anklebone , my Aunt Anna shot , in the exuberance of her youth , twenty-nine baskets in a match one afternoon against a fairly worthy basketball team . Sargent was , as you should know , the ranking institution in this country for young-women athletes . My own alma mater gave in  --  against my wishes , I must admit  --  to the march of time and installed a women 's basketball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in August of last year Army finally came to heel and did the same thing . I should point out , I expect , that the 1 , Vest Point freshmen , or plebes , arc today sometimes called smacks , and that what we now have before us  --  i.e. , Army 's first women 's basketball team  --  is made up of young women who are called sugar smacks . But on to more weighty matters . " " Wait a moment , " we said . " Do you still think that the idea of women on campus is a had one ? " " Not at all , " the curmudgeon said . " I 've surrendered . And so , I note today , have some colonels of my acquaintance who only last spring were thundering against the idea of a single high-heeled shoe embedding itself in their sacred greensward . Did you notice a couple of them screaming at the referees women referees , at that ? when they imagined that these women were overlooking Princeton fouls ? Not that Army does n't practice psychological @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the outset of the match showed ' HOME ' leading ' VISITORS ' 40-33 with no playing time left . Ah , well , I suppose all 's fair . " While we were driving up to West Point before the game , in a Rallye Red 1976 Volkswagen Rabbit , the curmudgeon had filled us in on the Army women 's record  --  five games under their belt in their first season of play , and all of them triumphs . The curmudgeon , who was clearly looking forward to the encounter , said he thought the Army women 's team might turn out to be the holy terror that the Army hundred-andfifty-pound football team ( male ) had been in its league for the past twenty years . The women , he said , were tough and scrappy but worked under one handicap  --  by Army regulations , they are not supposed to be more than six feet tall . The average height of the current team is five six . They play a fast-break kind of game reminiscent of the Celtics in their great days , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to , so to speak , man-to-man . As the second half of the match progressed , all this became apparent . The Army women were of almost uniform height , and their hair , mostly auburn , was so deftly cropped , Army fashion , in what Army calls the Dorothy THE NEW YORKER Hamill style that they looked a good deal alike as they wrestled down rebounds and flung them recklessly down court . The Princeton women , on the other hand , were an Ivy League assortment . There were three genuine beanpoles , two of them listed in the program at 6 ' 0 " , and one at 6 ' 2 " , and their ability to out-jump the Army women was obvious . The Princeton hairdos ranged from waterfall to ponytail , and there were such unmilitary adornments as a light-blue bandeau and a barrette . The curmudgeon said he detected only two unorthodox maneuvers on Army 's part  --  once when a forward called a huddle on court during a time-out , and once when , during play , one woman whispered instructions to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Both teams missed a lot of shots ( as the final count  --  Princeton 48 , Army 47 ? in dicates ) , and Army committed more turnovers than is usual , and often looked a little nervous in its first matchup with a nationally ranked college women 's team . But the game was as much of a down-to-the-wire thriller as a 128-127 double-overtime playoff game between the Knicks and the Celtics . Army was five points up on Princeton , thanks to the bull's-eye shooting of its star center , Carol Barkalow , about two and a half minutes before the end of the game , but some flashy buckets by Princeton 's Jackie Jackson , who has the moves of a smart schoolyard ballplayer , and two foul-shots by Margaret Meier made it 48-47 Princeton . Army had a chance to tie or win on a one-and-one free-throw situation at the final buzzer but could n't sink the first one . " God knows how my Aunt Anna scored fifty-eight points for Sargent under the dusty old rules that used to govern women 's basketball , " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In her day , for instance , the guards could n't go past center court . This is real basketball . Sargent rides again . " In Army 's locker room after the match , there were tears . " Girls feel freer to show their emotions , " said Dennis Van Fossen , a long , lean Specialist Five from Laurel , Nebraska , who is ending his Army career as , for the first time in his life , the coach of a women 's basketball team . ( He , and we , could n't know that exactly one day later Chuck Foreman would be crying on the field toward the end of the Super Bowl when the Raiders were beating his Vikings . ) The curmudgeon approached Brynnen Sheets , Army 's most aggressive guard , who told him she came from Edmond , Oklahoma , near Oklahoma City , where she 'd played only old-fashioned , six-woman basketball before coming to the Point . " I did n't see many of you wearing kneeguards this afternoon , " the curmudgeon said to her . " My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mailed them to me , and I have n't got them yet , " Brynnen Sheets told him . " The kneeguards are coming , the kneeguards are coming , " said Coach Van Fossen . " You know , last summer we did n't even know if we 'd have enough basketball players among the hundred and nineteen new girl smacks to field a team . " The young women trooped off to the showers , and , whether they were downcast or not , their voices were almost instantly raised in song . The coach picked up a laundry bag . " What 's that ? " said the o.c . " Well , I want the girls to look real nice , " said the coach . " I do n't trust the post laundry to do the uniforms tight , so I take them home to my wife . " By then , the Princeton women and their two coaches were seeping out of their quarters . We caught the assistant coach first  --  John Hicks-Hershey , a bearded young chap not long out of the Princeton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ballgame ? " the curmudge asked him . " I just rambled onto the Princeton campus and asked if they would n't like a little help with the girls ' basketball team , and it was n't long before I was , rather to my surprise , on the payroll , " said Coach Hicks-Hershey . " My wife thinks it 's a great idea . Pat Walsh is the head coach . " Pat Walsh turned out to be a young graduate of Immaculata , a celebrated fountain source of women basketball players which is situated in Pennsylvania . " When you matriculated at Immaculata , " the o.c. asked her , " had you any idea that you 'd wind up as head coach of the Princeton women 's basketball team ? " " No , " said Pat Walsh . " At that time , Princeton did n't even have a women 's basketball team . " She opened her coat to take her gloves out of her pocket and again revealed her courtside uniform  --  un wrinkled white flannel trousers and a vivid black-and-white zebra-striped sweater . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best-dressed coach on the North American continent , " said the old curmudgeon .
