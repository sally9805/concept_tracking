txt For the first time in the 23 years of modern Israel 's statehood , Saudi Arabia has agreed to admit Israeli Moslems for pilgrimages to Mecca . The decision of King Faisal was transmitted in writing to the influential Mayor of Hebron , Sheik Mohammed Ali Jaabari , who has championed the cause of Israeli Moslems ever since his city , on the west bank of the Jordan River , fell under the Israeli 1967 occupation . Over 325,000 Israeli citizens are affected by the long-sought permission . They are the families of Palestinian Arabs who decided to stay in their homes rather than become refugees after Israel declared statehood in 1948 and fought the war of independence . " We are very happy , " said Sheik Mohammed Hubeishi , the kadi , or Moslem religious leader , of Acre , where the greatest concentration of Israeli Arabs is centered .

A Religious Obligation Being cut off from the haj ? the holy pilgrimage to Islam 's central shrines ? has been one of the hardest consequences of Arab-Israeli tensions for Israel 's Arab minority . The pilgrimage to the city of Mecca , birthplace of Mohammed , is a profound religious obligation for Moslems , but for nearly a generation Arabs living in Israel have been barred by Arab governments from making it . As soon as Sheik Jaabari sent word yesterday that King Faisal had relented , excitement spread through Israel 's Arab communities . In most centers , newsmen were told that older people probably would go on the first pilgrimage , in January . " The young will have their . chance later , " said one jubilant Arab in Haifa .

Hussein 's Approval Needed He is now assembling a delegation of Moslem notables to petition King Hussein of Jordan for transit rights for the Israeli Moslems who wish to travel overland to Mecca , King Hussein 's concurrence was said to have been the one condition attached by King Faisal . Israeli Arab leaders said they believed that King Hussein would not raise any obstacles . Sheik Jaabari reported King Faisal 's decision to a delegation of Israeli Arab notables from the Haifa area who paid a call on him in Hebron yesterday .

Later Sheik Hubeishi said he would request waiver of the large travel tax that makes foreign travel virtually prohibitive for most Israelis , a request that seemed likely to be granted because of the Government 's eagerness to promote regional interchanges whenever any neighboring country permits them . Elections Are Ordered In another development , the military commander of the west bank issued orders today for municipal elections in four towns , Jericho , Jenin , Qalqilya and Tulkarm . This is a tentative step , long under discussion in the Israeli Cabinet , that is expected to determine whether the westbank population is ready to participate in normalization of political life under military occupation , Legally the terms of mayors and municipal councils expired long ago . Under Jordanian law , they serve'for four years , and there have been no municipal or other elections in the occupied territories since 1967 .
