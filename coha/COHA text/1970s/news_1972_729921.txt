txt The Nation 111 ? ? ? ? MINIM=MIMP /111111MIMMI Longshoremen : And in This Corner , Harry Bridges Harry Bridges was causing more anxiety in the White House last week than he ever had in the years when Presidents Roosevelt , Truman and Eisenhower were vainly trying to have him deported to Australia as a Communist . A Bridges order renewing last year 's hundred-day dock strike in West Coast ports lit a fuse that could blow up the Pay Board , battered guardian of the Nixon Administration 's wage-control policy . All the remedies available under the national emergency provisions of the Taft-Hartley Act were used up in ending the first tie-up , but on Friday President Nixon asked Congress to rush through a special back-towork law this week submitting the dispute to compulsory arbitration . Passage of such a law , however , would take care of only half the problem even if the longshoremen do go back to the piers , a question that Mr. Bridges left wide open at week 's end . A no less troublesome question for the Administration is whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Secretary of Labor under mandate from Congress come down with a wage award double or triple the 5.5 per cent set by the official wage regulators as the guide post for noninflationary settlements . The law recommended by the President calls upon the arbitration board to operate consistently with the Economic Stabilization Act , but it leaves the final decision to the arbitrators without review by the Pay Board . Given the vacillation with which the Pay Board has been monitoring its own standards , most experts in industrial relations are convinced that the most powerful guidepost influencing the umpires is likely to be the high-cost tentative agreement on wages and most other money items that Mr. Bridges and the Pacific Maritime Association had reached before the strike began . Only one issue  --  a highly technical one involving the method of crediting an automation tax on containerized freight  --  kept the two sides from a full settlement without any tie-up . Included in the tentative accord on all other matters was a basic 32.2 per cent direct wage increase in next contract expiring in the middle of next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a guaranteed annual wage fund to protect longshoremen against technological displacement . If the arbitrator were to order any substantial scaledown of either of these figures on the ground that they were out of line with the anti-inflation guideposts , it is highly improbable that the Bridges rank and file would stay on the docks , law or no law . " There are two industries that ca n't be run by the General Motors manual , the coal mines and the docks , " a Bridges aide warned last week . " There would be murder if the longshoremen were ordered back on terms below those they had been offered before the strike . " Thus , an arbitrator 's award incorporating most , if not all , of the money demands is expected . Some Administration experts view such an outcome as the best possible under the circumstances : It would avoid a strike showdown , which the Government might well lose , and the responsibility for approving an expensive settlement would rest not upon the shaky Pay Board but upon a transient arbitration panel . What that tidy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would carry a White House imprimatur . On top of that , as with every deviation from ceilings , the breach would not stop with one . The International Longshoremen 's Association , which is tying up loose ends of a tentative contract providing increases of 41 per cent over three years in New York and other North Atlantic ports , would almost certainly be a hitch-hiker on any above-ceiling authorization the Bridges union won . That would mean two breakthroughs for the price of one , and would probably mean a pullout from the Pay Board of its industry members and perhaps most of its public members as well . There is a measure of irony In the prospect that Mr. Bridges may prove an icebreaker for the I.L.A. in getting its pact approved . Three weeks ago the West Coast leader brought his executive board to New York to make final arrangements for a full-fledged merger with the I.L.A. The two unions had no trouble agreeing that they would go on a Joint strike if either had its contract trimmed by the Pay Board . But other commitments Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the merger talks collapsed . Despite that setback Mr. Bridges , 70 years of age and locked in internal union conflict with some of his lifetime power-sharers , was determined to solve his succession problems by merging with someone . He went to Washington and negotiated a tentative unification deal with the giant Teamsters Union ? a deal that had the extra attraction of promising to end a bitter jurisdictional fight between dock workers and teamsters over who stuffs containers at waterfront terminals . But when the jubilant Mr. Bridges returned to San Francisco he found he could not sell the merger to his fellow officers . Under the President 's bill the arbitrators will now have to rule on the teamster - longshoreman controversy as well as everything else ? an extension of Federal authority in union affairs that labor may find even more startling than the wage tangle . ?
