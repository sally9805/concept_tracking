txt Premier Aleksei N. Kosygin reported today that the seven months of talks with Chinese Communist officials in Peking had failed to make any appreciable progress . In a wide-ranging , nationally televised speech , Mr. Kosygin blamed the " general anti-Soviet course " of Chinese leaders for the inability of the two sides either to improve relations in general or to reach an accord on disputed frontier questions . He said , however , that " despite the complexity of the talks in Peking , which tire hampered by the Chinese side , the Soviet Union intends to continue them in order to find an agreement that meets the in // terests of the Soviet Union , China , and the entire world . " Mr. Kosygin addressed a specially invited audience of 2,000 in the Bolshoi Theater . He spoke in his role as the candidate from the city of Moscow for re-election to the Soviet of Nationalities , one of the two chambers in the Supreme Soviet , the Soviet equivalent of a national legislature . The elections ? scheduled every four years  --  for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Sunday . In keeping with Soviet practice , all candidates run unopposed . But the press publishes " campaign speeches " of the Soviet leaders to their constituencies as part of an effort to drum up popular enthusiasm . President Nikolai V. Podgorny speaks tomorrow and Leonid I. Brezhnev , the Communist party leader , and a member of the Supreme Soviet , on Friday . Other leaders have already Spoken . Mr. Kosygin 's remarks on the status of the Peking talks were the most authoritative since Oct. 20 when they began . The talks , which began after several months of sporadic border clashes , opened after Mr. Kosygin made a sudden flight to Peking last September for a meeting with Premier Chou En-lai . Chinese Demand Reported Soviet sources have said that China has blocked any substantive discussion until the Russians pull back their border forces about 60 miles . in his speech Mr. Kosygin made these other points on Soviet foreign policy : 41The United States is the " main source of international tension " and this has been responsible for the lack of progress in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not opposed in principle to improving relations with Washington since this would " meet the interests of our peoples and the whole world . " The United States must not think , however , that Moscow is more interested in better relations than Washington . rah &; Nixon Administration says it wants peace in Southeast Asia , but is carrying on a " medieval policy " and is violatin " norms of human morality " in Indochina . There can be no other solution than " immediate and full withdrawal of the troops of the United States and its satellites . from Vietnam and other countries of the area . " tilThe Soviet Union " firmly pursues " a policy of all-round support for the Arabs . The main reason for the failure to reach a political accord in the Middle East is " the Israeli ruling circle 's confidence of support from the United States imperialist forces . " qSoviet relations with France are very good , and recent talks with West Germany were " useful . " But it would be premature to predict the outcome of Moscow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon . West Germany must recognize the Polish and East German borders . Progress has also been noted toward calling a European conference . Economic Problems Cited In keeping with the apparent ' division of labor within the ruling leadership , Mr. Kosygin concentrated on foreign policy and economic problems , his chief areas of responsibility . Presumably Mr. Brezhnev will discuss in more detail questions dealing with ideology and the world Communist movement . Mr. Kosygin reviewed many of the problems facing the Soviet economy , particularly those affecting the consumer . Taking note of the severe shortages of meat in many parts of the country for more than a year , Mr. Kosygin promised that additional measures were being taken to meet the increased demands . He said that the last winter was not as severe as that a year ago and that this held out the promise of more meat . On construction of new buildings , a perennial problem here , he said that " we still build very slowly and the quality is not good and the plans are not fulfilled completely . " He said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later this year , would compel each construction enterprise to abide by its own plan and to fulfill it strictly .
