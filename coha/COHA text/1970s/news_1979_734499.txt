txt MAYOR BYRNE 'S task force on school financial problems warned Friday that if the state does n't come to the rescue immediately with a huge infusion of cash , Chicago 's public schools will have to shut down . Mrs. William L. Rohter , the Board of Education president , said she could not guarantee that the schools will be open Monday . But she insisted , " I am not saying the schools will be closed . " Mrs. Rohter , who said the school system needs - $175 million by Jan. 31 , blamed the immediate problem on the Internal Revenue Service 's demand for payment at once of $16 million . The $16 million represents federal income taxes that were deducted from employes ' paychecks in November but not turned over to the government . MRS . ROHTER SAID this demand by the IRS will prevent the school board from paying debts to dairies , bus and food companies , and other firms with which it does business . She said some of these companies are in a financial bind and some have threatened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not paid on Monday . She called upon Illinois ' senators Republican Charles Percy and Democrat Adlai Stevenson III and the state 's congressmen to urge the IRS to soften its position . A spokesman for Gov . Thompson said there is no danger of the Chicago schools closing Monday for lack of money . The schools are scheduled to close for eight class days next Friday for the Christmas-New Year 's holiday . " The next critical date is Dec. 21 , and the governor is confident that something will be worked out by that time , " said David Gilbert , the governor 's press secretary . FRIDAY IS NOT only the start of the // Tribune Photo by Quentin Oodt Mrs. William L. Rohter : No guarantee that the schools will open ' Monday . Fear school closing without state aid // school holiday but also payday for the system 's 48,600 employes . So far , the school board does n't have the $41.5 million needed to pay them . From a variety of sources , it emerged that the school system , which operates on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funds . In a meeting with reporters at City Hall , the mayor 's special task force of lawyers , accountants , city budget officials , and bankers said that Chicago is - not able to rescue the public schools on its own . They also said that the city can not afford to join in a plan calling for the city , the state , the Chicago Teachers Union pension plan , and Chicago banks to put up $50 million each to provide $200 million in short-term aid to the schools . SOME POLITICAL observers said the comments of task force members appeared to be an effort to put pressure on the governor ? The task force members , who agreed to answer questions only if they were not quoted by name , made clear that they want the state to join in a plan similar to the one outlined a week earlier by Mayor Byrne . Thompson , has called that plan " unacceptable . " Under it , the state would agree to buy $200 million in short-term notes issued by the school board : The city would guarantee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the notes if the school board could not . But under the plan , the school board would pay off the notes and acquire additional millions needed to put its financial house in order through the sale of a large issue of long-term bonds . THE PLAN FURTHER called for Chicago banks to buy the bonds if the state legislature passed laws enabling the school board to levy new taxes to ensure payment principal and interest en them . Before the banks ? could buy such bonds , New York-based financial rating services would have to give them an acceptably high rating . Because of years of financial mismanagement , the school board currently has a low credit rating and can not borrow money from conventional sources . To ensure the financial good conduct of the school board , the task force members said , new laws would-be needed to create a special oversight committee operating out of City Hall . Such a committee would give Mrs. Byrne far greater control over school operations than her predecessors had . THE MAYOR 'S TASK force said , it has been warned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rescuing the schools , Chicago will lose its own credit rating and be unable to borrow . They said that the city needs to borrow between $100 million and $150 million next month by issuing tax anticipation notes . In Springfield , Gilbert said Gov . Thompson and Mrs. Byrne talked by phone Friday and agreed that the city and the state should take equal risks in any financial bailout plan . Gilbert said they also agreed that the risks taken by the city and state should be greater than those taken by banks . But Gilbert said no plan can be made until precise figures are available showing the school system 's exact financial condition . School system records are in such bad shape that these figures have not been forthcoming despite days of work by skilled outside auditors . GILBERT AGREED that a bailout plan is necessary by next Friday because school employes can not be paid that day in the way they were on the last two paydays  --  through an advance of millions of dollars in state aid to the Chicago school board . Gilbert said that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Dec. 7 payroll , he is prevented by law from advancing any further state aid to meet the Dec. 21 payroll . In outlining the need for $175 million by Jan. 31 , Mrs. Rohter said $130 million is needed to meet the payroll next Friday and twice in January . She said the remaining $45 million would pay bills owed to those providing the schools with goods and services and also would be used to pay funds deducted from employes ' paychecks but not turned over to the proper agencies . THESE INCLUDE the federal and state governments for taxes withheld , plus amounts withheld for union dues and contributions to the employes ' credit Union . Robert H. Healey , president of the Chicago Teachers Union , said the union already has filed a labor grievance over the failure of the school board to turn over funds withheld for union dues and credit union contributions . He said this is the first step toward a lawsuit . Angeline P. Caruso , appointed this week as the system 's interim superintendent , said she is preparing a " barebones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operations during the crisis . She also warned that to make the spending cuts she thinks necessary , the new contract with the teachers may have to be renegotiated . HEALEY RULED OUT such a move . He said that under the contract , both sides must agree to any renegotiations during the ? life of the contract , and " we 're not renegotiating . " While taping the " Eye Witness Forum " to be telecast at 3 p.m . Sunday on WLS-TV Channel 7 , Healey said that if Miss Caruso wants to renegotiate contracts she might start with the school light bills from Commonwealth Edison Co. , then try to renegotiate contracts with other suppliers of goods and services . Miss Caruso replaced Supt. Joseph Hannon , who resigned and spent his last day on the job Friday .
