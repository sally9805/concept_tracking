 | The Edith Project : Bringing out the best in baby ON AUGUST 16 , 1952 , Aaron Stern called a press conference in a Brooklyn hospital . Stern , a survivor of Nazi cattle cars , Gestapo assaults , and midnight escapes into the black , snowy woods of Poland and Germany , showed the reporters a baby girl . He gazed raptly into her crib and said : " Meet my daughter , Edith . She is going to be a genius . I shall make her into the perfect human being . " With that Frankensteinian pronouncement , Stern devoted himself to what he calls " an idea that became an obsession " ? the Edith Project . For the past twenty-five years , his life has had a benign sort of mad-scientist motif that has brought him into conflict with the educational establishment , his wife , and with Edith herself . Stern never swerved from his goal . The beloved daughter , weighing six pounds , seven ounces ; nineteen ? inches long ; three weeks premature , conceived in defiance of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man whose wartime experiences had left him with a medical dictionary full of physical and emotional maladies ? this daughter , Stern vowed , would not be ordinary . Twenty-one years later Stern was again talking to reporters . He was making the Philippine government the following proposal : he would study the Tasaday tribe , a group of cave-dwellers found living in Stone Age isolation , bring back two children , and rear them . @# to become geniuses ( he was eventually turned down ) . It had worked with Edith , he said , and it would work with them . " I have done what I promised the world , " Stern says . " I have created a superior being . " Dr. Benjamin Fine , onetime education editor of the New York Times and a friend of the Sterns ' , said : " I 've watched Edith develop through her teens . Her IQ might possibly be in excess of 200 . She is certainly on the level of Einstein . " Edith , now twenty-four , consistently scores about 200 on an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatever that may be . She entered school at the customary age of six , already reading two books and the New York Times every day . She skipped alternate grades through junior high , and skipped high school entirely to enroll in college at twelve . At fifteen she was teaching higher mathematics at Michigan State and working on her Ph.D . But Stern 's claims , even his accomplishments , have not always gone uncensured . He was warned that he might be creating a monster . Critics called him cruel and self-indulgent , accusing him of stealing Edith 's childhood for his own aggrandizement . They suggested he was building a top-heavy structure ? all brain and no wit or warmth . They say IQ tests mean little or nothing ( a proposition with which Stern agrees : " I have subjected her to the indignities of IQ only to disarm my critics . " ) . Dr. John Freeman , Edith 's department chairman at Florida Atlantic University , has said : " Time will tell if her development was too fast . I 'm concerned at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her father . This may not prove good for her in the long run . I also question Aaron Stern 's claim that he molded her mind . But , yes , she is very bright . " No one disputes that . STERN HIMSELF can not say where he got the idea . When asked , he launches into a long and complex tale , obviously told many times before . During the war years Stern lived for two years in a hole he scooped out in the muddy woods of Europe , eating wolf and bulldog meat when he was lucky and nothing when he was not . He was captured by the Germans twice and escaped twice . Once his jaw was crushed by a Gestapo agent 's boot . After the war , in a refugee camp at Bad Reichenhall , he organized a school for orphaned street children . Arriving in the U.S. in 1949 , he and Bella , who were married in the Warsaw ghetto only to be separated by the war and later reunited , descended into what amounted to another ghetto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stern has never been well since . " I became , " he says , " a notorious patient , a professional patient . " He has had heart disease , hyperthyroid- , ism , and cancer of the jaw , and has been hospitalized 170 times ( he keeps  | track ) . It was after one of those times that a vocational rehabilitation worker tested him and concluded that , although Stern spoke six languages ( now ten ) , his intelligence was low . She recommended training as a welder . Instead he enrolled in Brooklyn College and finished in thirteen months . While Bella worked , Stern , virtually unemployable , spent years writing a book documenting Nazi atrocities , the manuscript of which ? 1,600 handwritten pages in six languages ? disappeared from his car one day while he was detained by Miami police on a traffic charge . In 1971 he wrote another book . This one was about Edith , his real vocation , and it was called The Making of a Genius . Stern himself published it , and has sold 3,500 copies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white house near the railroad tracks in North Miami Beach . There is a chartreuse living-dining room furnished inexpensively ( " I am somewhat of an ascetic , " says Stern ) , and stacked in the sun porch are cardboard cartons filled with unsold copies of The Making of a Genius . Shelves there were filled with folders of clippings and testimonials to his work . " I have always welcomed publicity , " Stern said , " even though Edith has come to think of it as an invasion of her privacy . " Edith had recently taken her first job , with IBM , and moved to the small city of Boca Raton , about forty miles north of Miami , driving down to visit her parents on weekends . Her title was assistant programmer in the development laboratory , but no one could tell me exactly what she did . IBM spokesmen said only , " It 's confidential . " Edith said , " It 's interesting . " Stern and I talked before Edith arrived . He dumped sheaves and folders of papers on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ critics , the " harassment , " the difficulty of persuading others that he was not an ogre . He was at the center , he seemed to say , of a hostile universe ? a man beset . I asked how he responded to charges that he had sacrificed his daughter 's childhood to his own ego . " Sublimation , I know , " he sighed . " Every parent has the desire to fulfill himself through his child . It 's not unusual . " He paused . " Ask Edith if she missed anything . Those who say I stole my daughter 's infancy are wrong . I did n't restrict her ; I added to her life . " There had been early disappointments . As a youngster Edith was sometimes " excessively arrogant . " She occasionally broke windows and furniture . Once she locked her father in the basement for half a day ( she maintains it was an accident ) . He was not pleased , he said , by her excess weight . In college , Edith changed her major from pre-med @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to cure her father 's many ailments when she grew up , to mathematics ; Stern was certain it was " to cut the string , to leave me out . In mathematics I can not follow her progress . " We inspected Edith 's library , some 3,000 books and magazines obviously collected by a lover of science fiction and fantasy . There were books by Robert Heinlein , Harlan Ellison , Isaac Asimov , Theodore Sturgeon . There were also Camus , Steinbeck , the Durants . There were novelistic spin-offs from Star Trek , a book of B.C. cartoons , and M*A*S*H Goes to Maine . " If she read that many books in the medical field , " Stern said , " she 'd be transplanting hearts by now . " THE SCULPTING OF Galateas seems an arcane enterprise , but there was nothing mysterious in Aaron Stern 's method . He calls it " total educational immersion " which , he says , " assumes that intellectual growth begins at birth and ends at death . It invites the utilization of all resources . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a construction site and she learned about physics . If we passed by a picket line , she learned about civics . " Since he was unemployed , Stern gave Edith more attention , starting earlier , than most children get . And he demanded more back . All this may not be especially rare , but Stern 's intensity and unwavering persistence over a period of many years surely are , and they may be unique . The Edith Project began immediately after the infant was brought home and established in her crib , a blanketdraped bureau drawer . Stern announced that the family 's cheap radio would be tuned to WQXR twenty-four hours a day . " Classical music , " he swore , " shall beautify her soul . " Except for repairs , the radio played for years . Baby talk was forbidden . Stern , then himself perfecting his English , read and talked incessantly , repeating words and holding bright magazine pictures before Edith 's scarcely focused eyes . He gave her flash cards with numbers and animal pictures on them , reading off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old travel posters around the family 's single room and spun tales for her of castles in Bavaria , pyramids in Egypt , and airliners over Manhattan . He filled her crib with multiracial dolls from the U.N . gift shop . He talked . For weeks little happened , and then he noticed that Edith would cry if the radio were tuned to jazz or popular music . Then she began to recognize the dolls . Edith was five months old and being breast-fed by her mother when the conflict between the two parents first came out in the open . " This period is conducive to learning , " Stern said , and announced that from then on he would feed the baby . " Please do n't deny me this pleasure , " Bella pleaded . But from then on Edith got her sustenance from Aaron . When she was eleven months old , Stern asked her how old she was . She rummaged in her crib , picked up the " 10 " flash card and held it up . Stern waited . Then Edith raised a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( he used kisses and candy as rewards for good performance ) , and she counted aloud , " One , two , three , four , five .... " When she did not learn well later on , he would forbid her to read . From Stern 's diary , April 1 , 1953 : " Like the spring sunshine which melts the dreary , all-encompassing icy landscape , so does Edith 's intellect emerge in all its splendor . " At one year she spoke simple sentences and identified letters on flash cards , at two she knew the alphabet . When she was one-and-a-half , someone gave the family an ancient set of the Encyclopaedia Britannica . " When I can read , " announced Edith , " I will read the whole set . " And Stern placed volume one into her crib . Today he says she had read it straight through by age four-and-a-half ; Edith can not remember , but believes she must have skipped around a little . When she was two , portraits of Gandhi , Tolstoy , Schweitzer , and Einstein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on humanitarianism . Then there was arithmetic which Stern taught using an - abacus , and walks through 22  | the neighborhood , during which they would read aloud in unison : " Mermaid Avenue , " " Barber , " " Motorola . " Father and daughter were inseparable , shutting Bella out . She went to work ; they studied and played . " You have stolen my child from me . You stole her childhood , " Bella said . He scarcely heard . When Edith was two-and-a-half , her father took her to visit Albert Einstein , who , several years before , had helped Stern get admitted to the Mayo Clinic for surgery that cured his cancer of the jaw . Edith read from the newspaper for Einstein , who confessed that he had not learned to read until he was seven . Edith would visit her father in the hospital . She learned to read his EKG , found a stethoscope and listened to his heart , pestered physicians for definitions of words she found in medical books , and finally ? inevitably -- disputed their diagnoses . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kissed her many times . When the neighborhood children began to talk about storks , Stern held a brief debate with himself and then disrobed to teach Edith about male anatomy and human reproduction . Edith , then five , relayed the facts of life to her friends on the block , an enlightenment which occasioned angry parental visits . It reminded everyone of the visits of years before , when Edith had dispatched Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny . Edith horrified the neighbors , what with telling playmates their epidermis was showing , or that they displayed narcissistic tendencies . But Stern appalled them . The apartment was crowded with documents , transcripts , and boxes of grisly photos as Stern labored on his book of Nazi atrocities . Edith chose the photos . The neighbors tsk-ed . And Stern would say : " You allow your child to watch television , which glorifies crime and violence , while I am teaching Edith the irrationality of violence and hate . " When Edith went to school after the family moved to Miami , Stern quickly earned a reputation as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and embattled innovator striving against the forces of darkness and barbarism . His unscheduled classroom visits struck terror into teachers ' hearts . " Her father drove us crazy , " recalls a school official . " He avalanched us with letters , pestered us on the telephone , interrupted school-board meetings . But how could we change the entire system just to suit one person ? " The Sterns ' son , David , was born when Edith was seven , and Bella drew the line . " I want one child , just one , to grow up normal . " So David 's training was less intense , though he is very bright . His ambitions , unlike Edith 's , are modest . When he was nine a reporter asked David whether he wanted to be a genius . He reflected a moment and then said simply : " No . " Everyone thought Stern was pushing too hard . Edith would be mediocre in spite of it , they said , or smart as new leather but socially retarded , loony , weird , goofy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In school she cared more for her books than for her looks . Her popularity , never very high , would increase just before exams , when classmates would call and ask for help . She was perennially interviewed and written about , and received bagsful of letters from advertising agencies , religious nuts , educators , quiz shows . There were even proposals for Stern as well as Edith . Not long ago a thirty-yearold California woman asked if he would father her next child so that her offspring would be favored with his marvelous genes . Her husband would n't mind , she said . But Stern , who has always claimed that genes have little to do with intelligence , declined . And is Stern content with the result of the Edith Project ? " I will confess something to you , " he said carefully . " I am not very impressed with Edith . She could have been much more given what the input has been . I do n't believe she has reached the plateau of Einstein or that she is a genius . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when she makes a contribution . " BEFORE I MET EDITH , I had thought of Mr. Spock , the superior being played by Leonard Nimoy on Edith 's favorite TV show , Star Trek . She did not resemble him . She wore a gray sleeveless dress , a bit too tight and short . She was , she said , about twenty pounds overweight , and she looked five years older than she was . Her face was pale and a bit puffy , with a slightly receding chin . But her eyes , . behind the lenses of wire-rimmed glasses , were @#  | very pretty ? large and dark with good strong brows . She reminded me of the solemn , competitive , bright kids I 'd known in school , those who would strain forward in their seats to answer every question . Edith was curt , almost sullen , and I learned later that her father had made the appointment without consulting her . Now he said severely , " I expect you to talk to him straightforwardly and in a civil manner . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not obliged to talk at all when Bella said , glaring at Stern , " You have no call to make a speech like that . Edith , like me , is just home from work , and she is tired . " Stern said , " She looks mad to me . " " She is tired , " Bella said flatly . Edith said nothing . Stern put the papers away , and we went in to a dinner of excellent borscht with carrots and apples , Kentucky Fried Chicken , and blackberry Manischewitz . Bella , toiling in the kitchen , said goodnaturedly , " I 'm the only person in this house who works . " Stern alone did not laugh . " I am not such a liability , " he said , and whispered to me later , " We are a closely knit family , though you see there is a certain conflict with my wife . " There was also a conflict with Edith ; it erupted once again during dinner . Stern was chatting amusingly about how " she " denied enjoying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reprints . Edith put a hand to her throat and gasped , " I do not ! " and bolted to her room . " I was talking about Bella . Bella , not you ! " he shouted after her . Edith later returned to the table , in a better mood . Passing the platter of chicken too fast , she dropped a thigh and a breast . Everyone laughed , and when Bella said , " Why are you so klutzy ? " Edith laughed , too . Edith willingly admits to her clumsiness . She had given up the violin years before partly because her fingers had grown too fat , and had been plagued by the same problem in her year of premed training . ( " My fingers would n't work . I 'd try to cut up the worms and I 'd always mess it up . " ) She does not , however , admit to being bothered by it . " I do n't care for my body , " Edith says flatly , " I 'd be happy to leave it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Edith 's reply to nearly every question , as if she never thinks out loud because she already knows the answers . All her life she has performed ? for her father , for teachers , for Albert Einstein , for the neighbors and the reporters . She learned as a child of eight that she could pontificate and have her words duly set down in print to read the next day . She was tagged very early as a whiz kid , a girl genius , and it would be surprising if she did not become a practiced know-it-all , probably without knowing it . Still , though Edith seldom laughs spontaneously , she manages to have a sense of humor about herself . The day after the chicken dinner , she and her father sat side by side at a sticky Formica table in the employee 's cafeteria at Sears , where Bella works as a saleswoman . Edith badly wanted a cigarette . She had been smoking since she was twelve and the week before had quit for the third time . As we spoke , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Have you created the perfect human being ? " " Perfection is utopian . But she is destined for greatness . " " Edith ? " She replaced the lighter in her purse , pushing aside a paperback book called The Weird Ones , and said with a glance at her father : " How can imperfection create perfection ? But I 'm ? you 're asking me if I 'm a perfect human being . I 'm going to feel silly if I say yes . " I was startled . " Are you tempted to ? " Her answer , as always , was ready : " I 'm sitting here overweight , having withdrawal symptoms , from something as silly as cigarettes , and wishing I had something sweet to stick in my mouth , and you 're asking me if I 'm perfect ? " But I 'm delighted with the outcome of his experiments on my mind , " she added . If she had children of her own , she said , she would rear them in the same way . That was shortly after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When we talked later , Edith was still working for IBM , was " immersed in real life in the business world , " and doing relatively well . " I 'm independent now , " she asserted . " I have- no more problems than others who have strong parents . They are somewhat loath to realize I no ion-24 ger accept the house rules , but I 've broken my father of bad habits like committing me to be somewhere and then being angry when I do n't show up . " Wilfrid Sheed has written about having been " a brutal case of precocity , a disease which can make both childhood and adulthood wretched , with just a few good years in between . " When I read the quotation to Edith , she was startled and said that it made no sense . " It was not a wretched childhood , " she protested , " and I 'm not having a wretched life . Of course , being a former child prodigy is like yesterday 's newspaper when you 're grown up . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're fifteen and just graduated , it 's one thing , but when you 're twenty-four and have graduated at fifteen , it 's lost some of its immediacy . " Sooner or later , what she calls " the horrid truth " comes out , and people realize that she is that Edith Stern ( " I have a problem with friends who are overproud , shall we say " ) , but it does n't bother her . If Edith and Aaron Stern are telling the truth , and they seem to be , his critics were mistaken . She is not a perfect human being . She has a few neurotic tics , but she functions perfectly well . She has her own car , she dates occasionally , though not seriously . She has lost weight ; she still battles her addiction to tobacco . She has thrown herself into so many pursuits that the uncharitable might assume she protests her well-roundedness too much . When I asked if I could reach her by telephone with a few further questions , she said , " If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and ? let 's see . Monday is bowling , Tuesday is karate practice , Thursday is volleyball .... " She is taking tennis lessons , was recently certified as a scuba diver , and is interested in underwater photography . She is having fun . And the great contribution for which she has been so carefully prepared ? Does she feel the world watching , waiting for the fulfillment of her father 's promise ? No , she said , which struck me as quite a healthy reply for a girl of twenty-four . " I refuse to admit it or see it . I 'll be disappointed only if I do n't do what I choose to do , and I have n't chosen yet . " Her future plans ? She said , " I 'll do what amuses me . That 's the only plan I 've ever had . " 11111
