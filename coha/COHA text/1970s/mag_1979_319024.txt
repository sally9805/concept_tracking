Talmadge claims victory <P> For months the Senate Ethics Committee has agonized over what to do about Georgia Democrat Herman Talmadge , who was charged with extensive financial wrongdoing , including filing $43,000 worth of improper expense accounts . In effect , the committee wanted to recommend that the Senate censure Talmadge without using that fateful word . " Censure " is a punishment that has been applied only seven times in Senate history ; the last occasion was in 1967 , when the Senate passed judgment on Connecticut Democrat Thomas Dodd for pocketing campaign funds . <P> In Talmadge 's case , the committee considered a variety of damning words , including " reprimand " and " condemn . " None of them seemed quite right , but last week the panel hit on a semantic solution : it unanimously recommended that the full Senate " denounce " Talmadge for " reprehensible " behavior and require him to refund at least $13,000 . Undismayed , Talmadge , who is running for re-election to a fifth term , claimed that the verdict exonerated him of intentional wrongdoing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result is a personal victory .
