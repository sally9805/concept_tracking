Returning home from a tour of Britain and the U.S. , the government-appointed Prefect of Paris , Maurice Doublet , produced his ratings of some of the cities he had visited . At the top of the list was San Francisco : " It reminds me most of Paris , but there 's more . There 's a very agreeable mixture of new big buildings and the old . " Second was London-good mass transportation and parking . The third choice , Chicago , was a pleasant surprise because " they 've respected nature in many areas of the city and there are good vistas . " <P> Los Angeles came in fourth ; Doublet said that he had found less smog there than he had expected . In last place , the Paris administrator listed New York . Central Park was joli , he agreed , but " if they brought New York 's subway to Paris , I assure you there would be a revolution . " Later Doublet 's office issued a statement denying that he had cast aspersions on New York . <P> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could only observe that if relative cleanliness and efficiency were Doublet 's criteria , then perhaps he would prefer Salina , Kans. , or Salt Lake City . Still , if it is true that the world 's great cities-ancient Rome or 19th century London , for example-have always been paradoxically noisome and even dangerous places , many New Yorkers could do with a little less greatness .
