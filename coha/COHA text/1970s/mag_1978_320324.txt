The Nixon Administration had the shop harder program , which urged housewives to flock to store food sales . Gerald Ford had his WIN ( Whip Inflation Now ) crusade . Now comes the Carter Administration 's entry in the P.R . war against rising prices : a 16-page booklet titled A Consumer 's Shopping List of Inflation Fighting Ideas . The guide 's producer , Esther Peterson , 71 , the feisty $51,000-a-year head of the Office of Consumer Affairs , says that the idea is " to help you cope " and to show people how to " stretch their food , housing , energy and health care dollars . " Some of Peterson 's advice for the inflation-worn : <P> FOOD . Before going to the grocery store , advertised sales should be checked . Shopping should be done at the end of the month when there are more specials . <P> FUEL . Oil furnaces and air ducts should be checked out at least once a year , preferably in summer , when off-season rates apply . Install weather stripping if a quarter can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bills can be reduced by visiting dental schools , where the patients ' work is done by students . <P> Peterson , an Assistant Secretary of Labor during the Kennedy years , was the first person to fill the White House consumer post after Lyndon Johnson created it in 1964 . Reappointed by Carter , and enjoying somewhat greater clout in the Oval Office , she helped persuade the President to raise beef import quotas in June as a way to drive down meat prices , and she is lobbying for legislation to keep coffee and sugar prices low . Of her new publication she says : " It 's not pabulum . It 's no WIN button . "
