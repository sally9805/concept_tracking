It was primary-election night in Chicago , but what was the matter with everybody ? Why no festivities , why not the usual arm pumping and back thumping ? The hordes of loyal Democratic Party workers who gathered in the Sherman House hotel to await the returns were uncommonly solemn and silent . Ward bosses did not barge exuberantly into Mayor Richard Daley 's tightly guarded inner office . They slunk in sheepishly or stayed away altogether . <P> The gloom was justified . The vote tallies had spoiled their plans and struck the machine a staggering blow . For the first time since 1938 , the Cook County organization had lost a primary . Not only had Edward Hanrahan beaten the machine 's candidate , Raymond Berg , for state 's attorney , but Insurgent Daniel Walker had won the party nomination for Governor against Paul Simon , now the Lieutenant Governor . Five machine-backed state legislators from Chicago had also gone down to defeat before independent candidates . As he moodily paced a corridor in the hotel , a ward boss remarked : " This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a miscarriage . " <P> The Daley ticket was trounced by a combination of the Old and the New Politics . The old was represented by " Fast Eddie " Hanrahan , who returned from the political dead-and as everyone knows , the dead do not vote in Chicago unless Daley tells them to . Daley had originally endorsed Hanrahan for reelection , but party pressure forced the mayor to dump him from the ticket . A grand jury had indicted Hanrahan for obstructing justice in the investigation of the killing of two Black Panthers by the police in 1969 . <P> Surprise Dessert . Hanrahan , however , decided to fight back , and he had the resources to do so . As U.S. Attorney for Northern Illinois and as state 's attorney , he had built up a reputation as a zealous law enforcer . He asked voters during the campaign : " Would you want your law enforcement carried out by me or by a nice fellow ? " A volatile man , he buttonholed precinct captains to remind them who he was and what they owed him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meetings , he sometimes tried to bash them down . He claimed that he had done more than anyone else to protect blacks from street crime , but he also played to the gut fears of whites . His appeal was likened to that of George Wallace . <P> Normally surly and dour , Hanrahan was at pains to demonstrate another side of his personality-one that people had not seen before . He developed a sense of humor . Marching in the St. Patrick 's Day parade , he doffed his hat and released a white dove as he passed Mayor Daley . He engineered a surprise dessert for Daley 's precinct captains when they gathered in support of Berg at a dinner . When they cracked open their fortune cookies , they found the message " Hanrahan is the man . " <P> Less amusing , Hanrahan made use of the powers of his office to help him get elected . It was implied that anyone who opposed him too vigorously might become the target of an investigation - and investigations are not popular in Cook County ; they have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
