Festival Prize " Last year , who knew ? " asks the ad for the New York Film Festival , Manhattan 's annual exhibition of new cinema . Below the question is the old announcement of Five Easy Pieces , first shown at last year 's fete . " This year , who knows ? " continues the ad , exhibiting an array of 18 fresh announcements and obviously hoping for more Easy Pieces . Not a forlorn wish . The festival already boasts one film strong enough to be both a commercial and aesthetic hit . <P> The Last Picture Show seems modest to the point of extinction . Its actors are unknowns , its scene a Southwestern tank town , and its subject boredom . To make matters even less promising , it is not in color . Yet the choice of black and white , like the choice of cast and subject , is shrewdly apposite . <P> For Director Peter Bogdanovich has seen Anarene , Texas , in the cinematic terms of 1951-the langorous dissolves , the strong chiaroscuro , the dialogue that starts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from Summer of ' 42 to Carnal Knowledge , total recall gluts the screen . There is nothing very ingenious about replaying Hank Williams records or showing a kinescope of Strike It Rich . But Bogdanovich has gone far beyond simple souvenirs . His film miraculously recaptures life-styles and attitudes-sexual , social , political that have almost vanished from the national consciousness . <P> There are no crescendos in The Last Picture Show , adapted ( as was Hud ) from a novel by Larry McMurtry . The film is , essentially , a two-hour countdown to maturity . A couple of high school football players , Sonny ( Timothy Bottoms ) and Duane ( Jeff Bridges ) , carom slowly toward responsibility in Anarene . There the primary pastime , as always , is sex . Furtive sex . Tainted sex . **34;16609;TOOLONG sex . Nice girls never let boys go " all the way , " and nice boys never deflower a virgin . All the townsfolk are decent types , but the featureless landscape and the oven-like days render them insensible . Any diversion suffices ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an evening 's entertainment . <P> Sonny , weary of unhooking his girl friend 's brassiere without being allowed further incursions , drifts to the wife of his basketball coach , and then to the high school tease , Jacy ( Cibyll Shepherd ) . Duane , Jacy 's jilted lover , swiftly belts Sonny with a beer bottle , impairing his sight but , oddly , not their friendship . The night of Duane 's departure for Army service in Korea , the youths attend the town 's last picture show . Anarene 's only theater is shutting down ; Sam , its owner , has died-almost because there is nothing else to do . On the final bill is Red River , the definitive John Wayne Texas epic . Outside , the real Texas waits in the dark , choked with weeds and dust , cramped in spirit and dimension , the butt end of the Old West .
