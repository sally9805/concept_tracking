 | can add two cubits to its length , and wield it so , shall conquer Hellas and the world ? But with this , " pointing to the sarissa , " it can not be done , " he said , " for only with both hands can so huge a spike be wielded , and without a shield upon his arm none can abide the crash of spears . " So spoke Pelopidas , with good understanding of the matter , for he had often charged in the front rank . But this he did not foresee , that the sarissa itself becomes a shield when a thousand are leveled in serried ranks , outreaching any spear , five points to each cubit 's breadth of front , with the rest upstanding behind . And who in the front rank can flinch when each is borne onward by the rush of a column sixteen deep ? And what need of a shield when the line of the enemy goes down at the shock of impact , a full pace before his shorter spear can touch your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and that sarissa , swung by strong arms , will at the final plunge drive its point through any fence of shield or armor . Whether Philip had heard this saying  --  as he well might , for it was then that Pelopidas led him to Thebes as a hostage  --  I do not surely know ; but that this thought , with all that it might imply , was already in his mind , even in boyhood , will be plain from what I shall now relate , which till now has not been told . For this was the beginning of my adventures ; so I account it . I was then fifteen years of age , well grown and strong , and rode in the train of my father on that mission to Thebes which afterwards brought him to ruin . But to me it was the beginning of great fortunes , as the god would shape it in ten days yet undreamed of ; for then first I met Philip , as it were by chance , boy to boy , in the streets of Thebes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think , without a god , and who else but  | Apollo , even then watchful over me because of her of whom as yet I had no thought ? And that this was no mere chance may be further seen in this , that my father had bidden me lie close at the inn while he was away , conferring privately with Ismenias and others ; yet as I waited I was beset by such an incursion of fleas that I could not abide it , but fled before them and went forth , wishing also to view the city . I11-built and mean it seemed to me , its boasted Cadmea little better than a mole-hill to one who had dwelt in the shadow of Athena 's towering citadel . Although I knew that of late Theban armies , artfully marshaled by a certain Epaminondas , had shattered the phalanx of Sparta , and that Thebes was now esteemed mightier than Athens , I scorned it utterly . So , as I turned a corner , seeing a hoopoe perched upon the head-screen of a statue in a garden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crying , " That , for Thebes ! " And a voice , close at my elbow , said , " Well thrown , Athenian ! " for the bird fell fluttering among the flowers beneath . At which I wheeled quickly and saw behind me a boy , richly clad but not like a Theban , and with him five others . Of my own age he seemed ; as handsome  --  for I was not ill to look at  --  and as strong , with swelling muscles that rippled in his arm as he raised it . His hair fell on his shoulders in a wavy mane , lionlike , and so he bore himself . His eyes flashed with a singular charm of good-fellowship , yet burned upon my face . I liked him well , but stood abashed , which was not my wont ; and I noted that his companions deferred to him . " How did you know that I am of Athens ? " I asked him . " By that accent ; all others mouth it . Besides , in that city , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this seemed clever , and I told him so , at which he was not displeased ? " That is , for one who is a barbarian , " I added , " for you are not of Hellas , I think . " But at this he blazed with anger , and caught my arm with a clutch like the iron tongs of a smith . " If you say that , I will break you into five villages , like Mantinea , " he cried . His face came close ; his eyes flamed in mine at a handbreadth ; and mine fell , I knew not why but knew my master . And as I did not resist he dropped my arm , still wrathful . " You do not yet know me , " he said , " else I would strike you dead for that " ? but even as he spoke his passion seemed to abate , his lips curling as if to smile . " I am of Macedon , but a prince " ? and here the laugh came . " It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Athens owe homage to none , " he conceded , looking upon me more kindly . " And the rest are as you say , but we of the royal house , " and his voice grew sterner , " are descended from the sons of Hercules ; that is well proven , and he was no barbarian . " He frowned ; again his wrath was rising . " No more is Philip , " he said fiercely , " and you shall confess it . Say it  --  that I am of Hellas and a son of Hercules . " I said it  --  not unwillingly , for I believed it . And I still believe that if any of the sons of men are in any manner derived from gods , he was indeed of the line of Hercules . " And that , " I said , " explains why I could not fight you . " He was smiling broadly now . " You would have made a stark struggle , " he told me , " for I felt your arm heave and stiffen in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But that is well over with . I like you , and when I am king , as I shall be soon , for reigns are short in Macedon , I will summon you , and you shall serve me . " But at that I protested : " I am an Athenian , of a city that  | tolerates servitude the least of any in Hellas  --  except , perhaps , for such as have excess of wealth ; and you know well that we Greeks abide no kings save in Sparta , where two are made less than one . " Now while we were talking thus , he urging and I , though fain , still refusing , we heard the sound of a horn , ill blown , like the squawk of a caught fowl , and we saw approaching a troop of Theban boys , training in sport with light spears and wooden shields ; who when they perceived us shouted , " Have at them ! These are the barbarian captives from the house of Pammenes , " and bore down upon us with leveled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with unfenced flesh . I was hot with rage at this , as was Philip , both at the word and the act ; yet not beyond reason . For as they came on quite steadily , massed after the Theban fashion with a narrow front and a deep backing , not to he withstood , he fled with the rest of us into a narrow space between houses , where they could not enter without breaking ranks . And here we repelled them with stones , which I cast unerringly , as at the bird , so that they drew back and stood at a more prudent distance . And for this Philip again commended me , saying , " I will have you yet , and you shall serve me as a leader of peltasts , for these , properly armed and led , are of much value ; but today I will put you to other service . " It happened that the smaller of the houses was a ladder-maker 's shop , and beside it lay a long pole , partly shaped but tapering overmuch toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And when Philip saw it , " We will smite them with the Macedonian sarissa , " he said , " and this shall serve . " Six in file he marshaled us , with meat the front , the heavy  | pole lifted to our shoulders and grasped with both hands , for so only could we wield it ; and with this we ran out upon them , while Philip with a carpenter 's mallet snatched from the shop ran at the side , like a troop of horse to guard the flank and follow up the rout . As all this had been done very quickly they were taken much by surprise , and though they kept in line and received us with protruded spears they stood without action , while I aimed at the center of their front , about breast high , and we delivered our stroke with the swing of twelve arms and the rush of a charge . Whereupon they broke before us and fled in dismay , dropping their spears , and some their shields , while Philip was upon them with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ borne the first brunt of the charge lay howling on the ground with broken ribs . We were well avenged . And so great was the tumult that some of the soldiers of the guard ran down from the Cadmea , who dispersed the rabble of boys , and finding Philip , led us  --  for I was forced to go with them  --  to the house of Pammenes , where the young Macedonians were kept as hostages . Here we found consternation , for the household had already missed Philip and discovered that he and those with him had gone out unattended . But after some explanation we were kindly received and set at tables , where we ate rich meats with great relish ; and here I first tasted the flesh of Copaic eels , for Philip insisted that I should stay and made much of me . Yet while we were sipping the wine , which to me was then a rare indulgence though to him an every-day matter , again we almost quarreled . For while we were drinking , I with some moderation but Philip with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a promise of future service , not as By the Will of Apollo 11  | a vassal but on good terms as a soldier of fortune , he demanded my name , which I had not yet told him , being wont t o tell no more than seemed needful . And when I answered , " Cylon , " he laughed loudly . " It savors of crookedness , " he said . Now this was a sore point , for others had seen this import iii my name and I had been mocked with it ; moreover my father , already under some suspicion , had been taunted with his descent from that Cylon who had once plotted against the city . So I answered shortly : " Rightly uttered it has no such savor , but your accent is Boeotian . " This he took lightly , laughing more loudly than before . " It is true , " he said , " for I am now among Thebans , heavy brutes and thick of tongue , like my own Macedonians , yet stark fighters . But with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your Attic speech beyond all others , and your city , too  --  so well that with the sarissa I will some day make it mine . " I put down my cup with a crash . " You , master of Athens , " I cried , " the most ancient city of Hellas , and the noblest ! You , a mere Macedonian , mad with wine and the blood of Hercules  --  who , though a god , never dreamed of an assault on the city of Athena . But you boast like a Thracian at a revel ; and you drink like one , " I added scornfully , " for no Greek gulps down his wine like that . To me you are but a Thracian ; and while you , bred in Pella , boast that you will take my city , you ask me to serve you ! " He was raising his wine to his lips , but flung it in my face . " Am I again called a barbarian ? " he shouted , his voice hoarse with anger and drinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wine cooled my brow . " No , " I told him , " for it seems like enough that you  | are descended from that Hercules who in his cups slew Iphitus , his friend . But this rage of yours  --  to me it is Thracian , though perhaps godlike . " He set down his empty cup and thrust away the slave who advanced to fill it . " I will drink no more tonight , " he said . " And , Cylon , whatever crookedness there may be in that name of yours , I find none in you , for you speak as you cast a stone . You shall serve me yet ; and since there are other cities , no few , to make prize of , against Athens I will ask of you no service . You need not fear that tale of Iphitus . When Philip is king , the king shall be your friend , and to you no Thracian . " Such was his promise  --  of which , later , I had need to remind him . How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and what my father , when I stood before him , said and did to me , matters little now , but I rode ill at ease as we hastened back over the long road to Athens the next day , seeing few but shepherds , for my father crossed the mountains by the more northern route . And let this be noted by him who is curious in such matters . When on the morning of the second clay we approached the city walls , my father , wishing to avoid observation , though knowing well that the place was unlucky , entered by the gate which opens on the Hill of Nymphs , close by that accursed ravine which we of Athens call the Barathrum ; where formerly were cast the bodies of criminals with all the refuse of the city . And here were cast the murdered kinsmen of that Cylon who once aspired to be tyrant , as men say ; hence to us beyond others the spot is ominous ; yet by this gate my father entered .  | In which is related what befell in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the city . In other gods , I know , my father had little faith , for he said that he had not perceived their works among men ; but that there is a god of luck , dispensing both good and evil with small regard for merit , he fully believed , since his works were manifest . And this god , be it Hermes or some being less known and nameless , he held in fear , not without reason ; for the luck of our house had been an ill thing from the beginning , when that Cylon who was the first of my name was driven from the city . But the worst , in his opinion , was in the time of my grandfather , when our family estate , which lay on the eastward slope of Hymettus where a drowsiness of bees fills the air , was made forfeit ; for this good man was accused with Antiphon and others of attempting to betray the gates , and though innocent was convicted by the craft of orators and the prejudice of the judges . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but with such ingenuity of argument and bitterness of invective that I am left in some doubt . For he was gifted in the twisting of words to his purposes , and being a man of large presence and loud of voice he resorted to that which had destroyed our fortune to restore it , himself becoming a pleader before the courts 13 14 By the Will of Apollo  | and soon a politician of note . I know that by some who feared him , and perhaps had formerly sent him presents , he has been reviled as a sycophant and a bribe-seeker ; but this is a charge uttered against all orators , even against him who was greatest . Yet I can not deny that those who spoke thus of my father might have some excuse , for he ever turned his influence to good account , and our new house in the Collytus quarter was soon well equipped with slaves and rich furnishings , with no lack of silver . But that my father was guilty of that for which he was brought to trial I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thebes to confer with Ismenias  --  who , with Pelopidas , had recently journeyed to Susa to incite the Persians against Athens  --  my father 's enemies accused him of conspiring with these men to betray Hellas to the barbarians , and with such charges terrified the rabble  --  though to people of sober judgment this was no more than a tale of chimaeras and griffins , since none any longer feared Persia , for in every city scarred veterans of the ten thousand whom Clearchus had led against Babylon had told of her impotence . Yet after Timagoras had been impeached for accepting Persian gold and the rage of the multitude had tasted blood , my father also was brought before the dicasts by those who well knew that at such a moment those who offer a victim may say what they will . Marvelous speeches they made , full of noble indignation and foul slander , demanding my father 's life ; and in the tumult that arose his answer was scarcely heard . No friend presumed to defend him ; but when he had been condemned and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than death , and this at last was granted , since the anger of the judges was now somewhat appeased.  | So fared my father  --  guilty , it may be , of some indiscretion , but not of treason ; and this has left in my heart a bitterness which time has not much abated . To him the hemlock would have been a kinder sentence , for this brand of infamy was more than his pride could bear . All night he pa ( cd the floor and in the early morning fled . None knew or tat ** but I , and at the city gates I took leave of him with ni:uiy tears , for he forbade me to go farther . Yet I followed Mill with my eyes as he slowly went forth , a broken man , never turning his head to look back , not even when he i cached the hill-crest and passed from sight . And since that d , iv I have never seen my father , nor has any report of him ever come to me . I turned from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unwillingly to the house of my uncle Pheidon , to whose ** ? I was now committed , since my mother had died some motif Its before . He was a miserly man , older than my father In eleven years , and had been envious of our prosperity in the days when men brought bags of silver to our house and l e f t t hem with humble messages . He deemed me a burden , lot my inheritance was forfeit to the state ; he showed me no kindness , and I hated him with all the heartiness of youth . Soot he called me before him and told me that it was time to be thinking of a trade by which I might earn my bread , as he was a poor man and could not support me in idleness , i onunending to me the business of making shoes , for which he said there was a good market among the wealthy t hough I went barefoot and he himself wore rude sandals of bark . And when I demurred , " You , perhaps , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profession of your father ! " But at this my gorge rose and I choked ; for at school that  | day I had heard myself called " the son of the sycophant . " And I answered , " I will have no dealings with the courts ; I will slay men in fair fight , not by tricks of speech . I will choose a profession worthy of my mother 's son , and if I must earn my bread it shall be by the spear . " For my mother was descended from that Dimon who won so many victories , a brave leader of men , the son of him who led the charge at Marathon ; and she was also related to that Cynaegirus who fell by the ships in this same battle  --  whose brother , they say , was Aeschylus , a poet , once a famous writer of tragedies but now little regarded . And already I had shown some aptitude with the light javelin , though with the stylus none . But at this my uncle was much disconcerted ; for if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at some expense , and refusing this he would be shamed . So he put the question by , telling me that a soldier 's life was a wretched business , which after much misery commonly ended in crippling and beggary . In any case I was quite too young to stand in the phalanx , he said , and bade me continue in school for a season . For I , being slow to learn , was still in the school to which my father had sent me , kept by Atrometus the freedman ? for whom his son has claimed a more honorable lineage , but whom Demosthenes called a slave , which is as near the truth as may be expected from contending orators when they break out upon each other . Like a slave  --  for such are always over-observant of dress  --  he treated me when I appeared before him in a ragged tunic ; and when my charges were stingily paid his harshness redoubled , and his son , five years older than I and a helper in the school , began to make me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even then . Yet the schoolboys were no better , except that By the Will of Apollo 17  | they feared my strength , which bred in them some caution of speech . All were against me save one , like myself bereft of parents and under a guardian upon whom he lavished no affection ; for he too was but scantily furnished , though he had inherited wealth . At first I had not liked this son of a tradesman ; I had even joined with the rest in taunting him , for we deemed him a weakling . Though of fair stature , he was not strongly framed and suffered much from illness . He seemed older than he was , being in fact of my own age within a month ; yet I have noticed since that advancing years had small effect upon him ; he still appeared the same . To me as he came among us , a boy among boys , he seemed somewhat affected , conceited of himself with little cause , being inapt in sports , reserved in manner , devoted to studies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aspired to be a great orator , like Callistratus , though he sometimes stammered after a fashion that made us laugh . Yet this was not customary ; it came upon him chiefly when he stood before the master for reproof or was jibed at by the boys , for then he might choke with resentment and stutter his anger while we laughed the louder . At other times he would answer with such a flow of words and sharpness of retort as forced us to some admiration , and his eyes would flame with the unquenchable fire which glowed within him until we stood abashed  --  as well we might be , for this was no other than that Demosthenes whose steadfast spirit , in the darkest hours that have shadowed the world , would at last become the guiding star of Hellas , shining most brightly out of the deepest gloom . But what the years would reveal was still on the loom of the Fates  --  unsuspected , unless by him , and unseen save by Apollo .  | Hitherto , of all the boys in school , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liked him least . Yet now , as I stood alone in sullen shame , he approached me and took my hand . " Cylon , " said he , " it may be that you have not always used me quite fairly , but let that pass . We may well be friends , I think , and for those who have need of each other to hold aloof because of old grudges is mere folly and meanness of ' spirit . This , at least , I wish to say to you : I was present at that trial , and if I had been thirty years of age , with a hearing before the court , your father would not have lacked a friend and he would not have been convicted . " And with this , though it seemed no more than the vaunt of a self-deluding child , he won my heart , then so empty of ' comfort . But , still sullen , I answered , " It could not be , though you were Pericles . Never yet was there an orator in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hear , or , pleading the profitless truth , could hope to win against lies . " " Then , " said he , " what never yet was , shall be . " From that time forth we were friends , but soon parted ; and thus it befell . One day at school we had paused from the weary droning of the admonitions of virtuous poets by rote , for our midday meal , each eating what he had brought from home ; and I was gnawing on a barley cake , hard and dry , for my diet was such as might subdue my spirit even to the making of shoes , which doubtless was my uncle 's purpose . And while I strained my teeth upon it , with meager spoils , Aeschines watched me and presently flung at me a taunt so hateful that I hurled my cake in his face like a sling-stone , drawing from his nose more blood than he afterwards shed in that service at Tamynae of which he has made such a . boast . In days then far distant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manner of speaking , when he had presumed to use it against Demosthenes ; but I waited for no advocate , nor did I trust to words . Having flung my defiance I rushed upon him as a dog goes against a boar , and though he fought with some resolution I beat him down and would have taken deadly vengeance , but I was plucked off by many hands . So ended my schooling . For my uncle , berating me for my conduct yet not ill pleased that I had justified his harshness in the eyes of the neighbors , led me next day to the shop of a cobbler with whom he had made some sort of bargain , where I was given a knife and a piece of leather , with certain instructions . But as soon as my uncle had passed the door I slashed the good leather in strips and cut them across for more perfect ruin , and when the little cobbler would have checked me menaced him with the knife . Then , as he would have no more to do with me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who thereupon took a staff from the wall , but having looked at me put it back and eased his heart in words . When morning came he led me to the shop of a wagonmaker , who , noting my size and strength , was pleased with me , so that terms were quickly agreed upon . And since this man was himself so big and strong that he did not fear me I kid an ill day , but at nightfall , picking up a stout billet of ash , I returned once more to the house of my uncle resolved to submit no longer . I went straight to his chamber , where by the flicker of a lamp I found him counting money , much of it in gold , which he hastily covered with his cloak . He was trembling , almost in tears . " You need not try to hide it , " I told him , " since I have seen . And you need not cower , as if I were a robber , when I only ask for my own , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not refuse . I will endure no more of this . I will go where luck may lead and you shall be rid of me ; but of what is my 20 By the Will of Apollo  | due you shall give me a mina of silver for travel and present needs . " At this he cried out that he was a poor man and my demand beyond reason , yet being terrified offered a daric . " And that , for a pauper , is much , " he assured me , for even in his fear he could not curb his tongue . For the insult I cared not a whit , but I would take no less than I had asked . " And unless you give it , " I warned him , " I will indeed adopt what you call my father 's profession . I will accuse you before the courts of concealing part of my father 's property , which was forfeit ; and men have wondered that so little was found . Have I not seen that great mixing-bowl of silver , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so ill hidden under the edge of your cloak ? It was from my father 's house . And those golden darics over which you are crouching , how did you come by them ? " He denied everything , though the proof lay before us , weeping and lying like a child . But now , being much cowed , he promised the mina ? " as a gift , " he told me , " because of kinship . " So I left him and for the last time slept beneath that roof . He , I think , slept little , guarding his money and lamenting the mina . In the morning he went with me beyond the gates , for he would give nothing until I was well started on my way , fearing lest I stay to spend it in the city . Then , looking about him and seeing nobody , yet bidding me hasten lest we be observed , he slipped into my hand a bag of silver  --  which I forthwith poured out on the ground and counted before him , finding it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return to his house he made good the whole sum , for he had it by him in another pouch . And so , with scant courtesy , I took leave of him forever .  | I followed the road along which , scarcely three months before , I had seen my father dragging slow steps as he too passed into exile . But on the ridge where he had not so much as turned his head , I looked back , beholding for the Last time in many years the towering figure of Athena on her sacred rock , high over her city , lifting her spear in anger as it seemed to me then . As I crossed the broad , hot levels beyond , my bag of coin , at first a delight , became a trouble to me , the more as I feared to let it be seen ; and on reaching the lower slopes of the mountains I withdrew into a thicket , where I slung it rider my tunic beneath my left armpit , for so it seemed safest to carry it through a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all cities . And now I climbed the rocky path leading into the hills , feeling quite secure in my ragged gown , which no marauder would ever suspect of hiding money and as I went , to give voice to my joy in so new a freedom , I whistled a song from a comedy  --  the words , thus left unuttered , being such as are not deemed fit to be spoken save at the festival of the god . Soon I came in sight of the fortress of Phylae at the 21  | summit of the pass , and here , not wishing to meet the guards , I made a wide circuit by a trail that led me deep into the forest . And as I entered a glade I heard my song echoed by a great booming voice which sang the very words , omitting none . And out of the wood came a man , the hugest I ever had seen , in height exceeding four cubits by a span , and two cubits across the shoulders ; and he stood in my path with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a heavy boar-spear . Then , as I cowered before him , he spoke in tones that seemed more terrible than the thunders of Zeus . " What sort of imp are you , " he demanded of me , " that stroll so friskily through the hills , spearless and woefully wounded in the smock , chirping a snatch of Dionysus in his drink ? By the thirst of the god , I thought you were some satyr , well soaked with wine and strayed from his fellows . But mark you , young hoopoe , here is no passing for spies except by way of Styx ; nor , by the howling of the hound , for any other , god or man , unless he be of our gang , for these woods are mine . " I was sick with fear ; of such a being as this I had never dreamed . But I told him that I was the son of Hermogenes , his only son , and had lost my way on the mountain seeking my father . He laughed loudly . " Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acquaintance , and am reminded that I owe him a bullock 's tongue for notable luck at dice , which I have not yet paid , being myself of great appetite . But of this Hermogenes I have no knowledge , be he god or man . Yet it matters little ; from this place we send none back to tattle of us in walled cities . " And he smiled as he fingered his knives , as if selecting . Then , faint with terror , I told him of my father 's trial , and that he was an exile and had passed this way . liy the Will of Apollo 23  | He dropped his hands , and his look was less grim . " We did not happen upon him , " he said , " and that is the better , for being empty he would have died to no profit . Whom the courts have stripped I deem no fit booty for thieves . But his son is less lucky , and I am sad at thought of it . For I myself ant soft-hearted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thief not altogether devoid of piety , especially after drink , having been reared in some reverence for the gods ; but my cornrades yonder would stop Apollo 's chariot should he chance this way , and strip the very god of his shining robe . Yet vours , I think , they will presently leave on your carcass , for a Fisher 's net is not more full of holes . By the hound , it is an unprofitable waste of good blood , but I see no cure . My boy , " and his eyes began to twinkle , " is it because you were beaten at school that you fled to us ? " " It may be , " I said ; " but I beat the master 's son in fair fight , and would have killed him but for those who dragged me off . " He broke into a hoarser laugh , a hollow roar that shook the pine leaves . " So you have the spirit to slay , and have done it , at least in thought . Then for you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you will abide with us . I am loath to cut your throat without due cause ; there is neither mirth nor profit in it . But here , though my body was sweating with fear , I made some question . " First tell me this , " I said . " What manner of man are you , and of what city , and what is your name ? " For nay heart was so stuffed with the phrases of Homer learned at school that in my terror I could find no other words . Again he made the forest quake with his laughter . " Did you hear it ? " he shouted into the bushes . " He has asked my inane  --  of a thief  --  yea , and my trade ! " and his voice almost broke . " Come forth , " he called , " but draw no knives . This  | lad is no spy from the fort , but a young scapegoat from the city . He will make an ill thief , lacking cunning , yet with training may serve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As he spoke three others came out of a thicket , less huge , but more malignant of face , I thought . Plainly they looked upon me with less favor ; for though they obeyed their leader and their knives remained in their belts , their fingers lingered dear . " No tricks , " he said to them sternly . Then , to me , " You seem well muscled ; have you any skill with weapons ? " " With a good javelin , " I told him , " I can do something up to forty paces . " On the edge of the glade stood an oak , old and full of gnarls , on which a squirrel , alarmed at the noise , lay flattened like a patch of gray lichen . " Strike me that beast , " he said , and put the boar-spear in my hand ; yet , wary of treachery , he stood close beside me with his knife drawn and ready . The spear was over-heavy for such a cast , yet of proper length and well balanced . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a spring as made him lift the knife ; but he dropped it as the weapon left my hand and with a little murmur through the air sank deep into the wood , pinning the squirrel to the trunk . At that he bellowed applause , and the rest joined . " Not once in thrice could I have done it myself , " he cried , " and you at the first cast with a spear not of your choosing . " And when he had recovered the javelin , " Without breaking , " he said , " I scarcely could pluck it out , yet the point was not bent . My boy , you have in you the makings of such a thief as Mount Parnas has not yet seen , and unless you refuse our fellowship your throat shall not now be cut ; otherwise , here ends your journey . " By the Will of Apollo 25  | I did not refuse , nor yet , in my heart , consent . I was desperate and had no choice . " You shall swear , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knife ; for to us of the mountains this alone is truly binding , and with this came blade is treachery paid its wages . " Ile picked up the knife he had dropped and with the point scratched my arm , and his own , and those of the others , smearing a little of'the mingled blood upon his lips , and mine , and those of the three . " Now we are brothers , " he said , " and to all men else enemies , on occasion , even to the slit ling of throats . But remember , " he warned me , " the next e ut , if it comes , goes deeper . " He spoke with menace in his tone , and not yet did he trust me with a weapon ; but to me all this was idle mummery , not an oath , though I submitted perforce . ' Then , through the deepening twilight under the pines , they led me by devious paths to their cavern ; not indeed a true cave , but a deep cleft between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost touched their branches across it , yet a glimmer of the sky came through . Itelow , the entrance was narrow and lost in thickets , but opened within to an ample floor of bare rock strewn with boulders , on three of which a broad slab of stone had lodged , which they used as a table , while others served as seats . Safe hiding it seemed ; yet , once discovered , a very ( lap , as I saw at a glance . In a deep recess under jutting rocks they showed me all manner of plunder piled in heaps  --  arms , garrnents , vessels of silver and gold , and much coin . " But these , " said they , " are ours ; these we will divide with no one . What comes later you may share . " " Yet one thing he shall have this night from our store , " broke in the captain , " and none shall deny him . A new shirt  | he shall have and may choose it from any pile ; for now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the luck of thieves . " This filled me with alarm , for I felt the perilous lump of silver close under my armpit . " No , " I said , " I will rob no comrade of his spoil , but will go as I am until I myself can win better . " They applauded my word , yet watched me closely as they displayed their treasures , among which I noted with loathing the rich garments of women and their jewels . But seeing their eyes upon me , I made a shift to turn a jest , saying , as if in gaiety of spirit , " The ewes too come to this shearing , it seems . " " All alike , " they answered ; " all that have fleeces , rams , ewes , and lambs . " And hearing this I thought better of the Cyclops , who devoured men only . Yet when meat was spread on the rock I sat among them and ate with the zest of keen hunger , so that the captain muttered , " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from home , and all day he has gone without food . " Thus they were lulled of their suspicions ; and when they had dragged to the table a great sack of sea-wine , hot and stinging , they poured it , untempered with water , into a crock , from which they dipped and drank as thirst prompted . " No water for us tonight , " they cried ; yet to me , as unused , they permitted a little . And since , for what I had in mind , I had need of both valor and wit , I dipped as they bade me , but poured in of the water more than they knew and of the wine drank less . And here I had a good fright . For as the wine began to warm our throats and the silence of eating was broken , the fellow who sat at my elbow , dark and squat , speaking with an accent like nothing in Hellas , plucked my tunic and said ,  | " Why you not streep for throw ? Man offstreep alway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a shrewd wrench broke his hold . " Because I had no need , " I told him . " This you saw . And if you tear my chiton I will break your arm . " For I felt myself the stronger and already was learning their manners . I lis left hand sought his knife ; but the captain , reaching across , seized him by the hair and shouted : " Let be ! Did you not hear him , Bogas ? He had no need , but casting from his shroud of rags with one drive spiked the squirrel . " He seemed to gloat on this . " Had he put off that shirt of his he could ill have put it back , " he roared , " being as full of holes as a mesh for birds . By the hell-hound of the kennel by Styx , if ' you harm him , Bogas , I will spike you like that squirrel . " ' Then , wishing to turn their attention , " It seems that you do have names , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broadly . " Aye , for convenience of speaking , and that is well said . And whether Bogas be his whelp-name or some other , what of it , so far from home ? For the fellow is one of those Massagetans of whom you may have heard , who dwell in frosty shade behind the climbing place of the sun and eat their elders . " " But those , " I told him , " are the Cimmerians , and it is not they that ? " He cut me short . " Then let him be a Cimmerian . It matters nothing , nor of his name ; and if , on some festival occasion he has eaten his grandfather , which I deem not beyond him , he will do no penance here . But as to this c ouvenience of names  --  for I understand you , comrade , and this a thief may ask of a thief  --  mine at this time is I.achas , of Arcadia . " " You have say you be Attican , Lachas , " murmured the barbarian . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " 28 By the Will of Apollo  | " Did I say so , Bogas ? Now mark the folly of thieves , to believe a thief . It was yesterday , Bogas , that I said it ; today I am of Cynaetha . For two from one city breed plotting and ill luck . " " Luck spoil already , Lachas , " said Bogas . " Four , it is luck and of Hermes ; five , it is of no luck . " He turned upon me a look of malice . The rest grew grave , and one began , " I too have heard ? " But the captain , breaking in , blustered them clown . " You have heard  --  yea , you have heard many lies , and believed them . Will you quote me the cant of priests , and choose me a holy number for a gang like ours ? " Then to Bogas , " Let no barbarian make talk of Hermes , for the god will be vexed . I tell you the luck is not of numbers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring luck . But if you will have it that five is luckless , he who grumbles shall be fifth . " So he silenced them . But I , still fearful of Bogas , held up my bare hands , saying , " See , Lachas ! I alone of this pack am toothless . Is it well ? " He frowned , then laughed , and said , " Tomorrow you shall be fanged . Tonight I will growl beside my cub , and none shall molest him . " He spread a pallet beside his own , and there he bade me lie and make no more talk ; then , going back to the wine , he drank and howled impious songs and jests with the rest , till the sputtering torch had burned low in its cleft of stone . At last , unable to bear more , they reeled to their beds , where they fell and lay face upward , with a snorting as of crocodiles on mud-banks of Nile . I had laid myself down on my left side for the better guarding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against my ribs I rejoiced in it . Moreover , it helped to keep me awake , and even so I had almost lost myself many times .  | How I had dared to plan what I now ventured is still an amazement to me ; in after years , in the full strength of manhood , ripened with perils , I would have hesitated . But the danger of lingering among them was scarcely less , and to lead a life like theirs seemed worse than present death . The silver too incited me . It was mine ; I would not give it up ; I would have the spending of it at whatever risk . I rose on my elbow , then to my knees . The giant beside me trumpeted through his nose like that great beast of Indus ridden by Porus  --  though of that I had then no thought . I reached out with my hand ; with the tender stealth of a mother who would not wake her child I drew a knife from his girdle , and the joy of a weapon filled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I felt the edge ; it was keener than that with which I had slit the cobbler 's leather . And such a new boldness possessed me that , seeing an amulet hanging awry from his neck , I gently cut its thong and took it , leaning close to his face . But I would not harm him , unless at utmost need . Brute though he was , he had been kinder to me than my uncle or my city . Toward Bogas , who lay a little aloof from the rest , dim in the gloom , I cast a look , but turned away hastily . I presumed no further , but stole out softly from that evil place ; and as the fresh wind of the mountain smote in my face , I had a longing to shout for very gladness . But I fled in silence under the brightening sky , through dusky ravines and down slopes of some hazard , till with the rising sun I stood on the edge of tilled land , and the wide Boeotian plain lay before me . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ richer only in the wit that breeds so quickly from danger . For , as I view it now , I had left my boyhood in that den of thieves .  | In which is related how I entered the service of a tyrant and how I helped to deliver a city . Of the years that followed , until that great adventure in which I first saw Doria , when also I learned the might of Apollo and what his favor may mean to men , I am not so proud as to make a long tale of it . Yet within this time I grew to the full four cubits of manhood , of all statures the best for endurance and active strength , so that my eyes now looked downward into the faces of most . And while I thus outgrew my comrades and my sinews toughened until my javelincast , at full stretch with a thong , was upward of a hundred paces , I learned in the hard school of service such lessons of craft and skill that when I offered my spear none was chosen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was less easy ; and once in Thessaly , for unasked counsel to Daiphantus concerning the order of battle , I received on my shoulders such an acknowledgment from his staff that even today my back aches at the thought of it . That the counsel I gave was sound I will still maintain , for the event showed it ; yet so I was taught that in war one voice alone must be heard . Hence I mastered the gift of silence and of speech that tells even less , 30 B t/ Will of Apollo 31  | and learned at last to trust none wholly . And living thus , my heart grew hard with my body . All this came slowly , like a soldier 's pay , and though my adventures were many , they were not altogether such as one would care to recount in later days . I shall therefore deal with these years of my schooling in arms quite curtly , as Ptolemy treats of the time before Alexander crossed the Hellespont . Yet some part I will tell . When after my flight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and made known my name , I expected to be made much of because of my father . But in this I was sorely disappointed . I was , indeed , as a matter of no consequence , allowed to enter ; but neither at the house of Ismenias nor at the house of Pammenes was I received . Ismenias , it seemed , was absent on a mission , and Philip , I was told , had returned to his own country , where there was trouble enough , for some usurper now held the scepter . Only the traders greeted me with any kindness , and they only when they discovered that I had money . For at the shop to which I went first , to purchase a decent garment , the fellow thrust me from the door with insolent words ; but when in my anger I turned and flung a drachma in his face , though it cut his lip he ran out and pulled me back . So , buying of strangers the hospitality that none offered freely , I lodged at an inn and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indulged in pleasures for a time , as is the wont of unseasoned youths in a foreign city . Yet soon I was turned from these courses , and here is a strange thing to tell . For this came about by a dream , which after waking I could not recall , yet all day it haunted me ; and at night , when I slept , it came again , and again in the morning I could not remember , though it changed my 32 By the Will of Apollo  | mood like a heady wine . Something sent by a god it seemed , and of exquisite sweetness , leaving my spirit filled with some new joy ; and the name of Apollo rang in my heart , though hitherto I had worshipped him as little as any . I could not at all understand it ; but since I found no further relish in pleasures such as the streets of Thebes had to offer , I presently left them and sought the camp , with still some remnant of silver in my bag . Here , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days Thebes had need of many spearmen , and when the captain had seen my cast of the javelin I was quickly enrolled as a peltast . First , as being undisciplined and raw to service , I was put under training in garrisons on the border , and I served seven months in Oropus , then newly wrested from Athens . But later I served under Pelopidas in that expedition into Thessaly in which , by mere folly and heat of anger , he lest his life after the battle was won . For seeing in the press of those in flight that tyrant of Pherae who once had betrayed him , he rushed against the man in heedless rage , with few about him , and being encircled was struck down . So ended Pelopidas , than whom I have seen no soldier more gallant ; and so great was our love of him that in the pursuit we spared none , either for ransom or sale . But the tyrant , being well horsed , escaped to breed further mischief . After this , being now rated as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marched in the phalanx to Mantinea , where Epaminondas fell in the very impact of victory . But this too I rather blame as Theban folly than praise as valor ; for while he directed the battle he bore a shield in the front line , and as the opposing ranks broke under the shock of the onset a spear crushed into his side and snapped short . So it is told , and so indeed it was ; for I stood near when he bade them  | pluck the iron from his wound , and his life gushed out with his blood . Of all that have held command in Hellas , and such also was Philip 's opinion , I esteem him greatest in the marshaling of men . Worsted in skirmish he might be , but on no set field , for always his column cleft the phalanx of his foe as a war-ship splits a wave , and the rest was but the spearing of men in flight . But Philip , though none knew less of fear , was more prudent in this , that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He would go to the front when he saw that his presence was needed , and no whizzing of darts could then deter him , but he commonly held a little aloof from the crash of combat . For to wield a sarissa , he said , was a soldier 's business , but a king 's to wield armies ; and he deemed it mere Boeotian stupidity , more worthy of bulls than of men , t o rush on the spears and so lose victory with life . But his son he could never persuade of this , and once when I heard t hem arguing the matter the son had the better ; for , " If a king may not fight , " said he , " then to be a king is like a sickness . " So spoke Alexander while still a youth , and in this he was ever a boy ; yet that speech warmed my heart . But with Epaminondas died the fortunes of Thebes , for none like him remained ; and though the cities of Hellas were still at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as served for pay were dismissed . Then it was that I took service , perforce , under that same tyrant of Pherae whom I had once met in battle , for those who live by the spear must take what service is offered and may not be squeamish . And this I have noted , that the pay of tyrants , as of kings , is far better than may be had of free cities , but the service harder and the levy worse . In this army at Pherae were gathered the refuse of all lands , thieves , exiles , runaway slaves , since few  | others would willingly serve a tyrant so odious . And if here , at his command , I had some part in deeds such as I shame to remember , let this be my excuse , that I had little choice or none . One only in that place moved me to any admiration  --  no man , but the tyrant 's wife , a woman called Theba , once noted for beauty , but now somewhat faded . It chanced that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had been commended by the tyrant and placed among the house-guards , hence I often saw them sitting at meat together ; and though she sported with this fierce brute like a child that makes a pet of a bull and hangs garlands upon it , I presently discovered that she had not failed to observe me , and with no little favor , as I stood erect with my spear by the door . For one day when the tyrant was absent and I had been left in charge of such troops as remained , she touched my arm and drew me aside to a more private quarter , where , falling on her knees and clasping mine , she implored my aid in no light matter . Her face , seen at near view , was no longer childlike , but a tragic mask with paint and terror , and out of its gaudy white and red shone the eyes of Medusa . The tyrant had wearied of her , she said ; he grew impatient and was already planning to destroy her . Of this she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her brothers too were to die . " But you  --  you shall kill him for me , " she whispered , and shuddered as she said it . " You shall kill him , and free all Thessaly from his tyranny . You shall yourself be tyrant in his place and have all that he has , even Theba . " The tale seemed likely enough , and I had no ill will to the deed . Such an act was accounted no crime ; it would be applauded to the ends of Hellas . The man was abhorred of By the Will of Apollo 35  | all ; and as for me , I knew that he would jam his spear between my ribs on the smallest provocation or suspicion . " For Theba , " she pleaded . " You need not hesitate . Even his household serve him only for fear and greed . Once he is dead not a hand will be raised . They will greet you as a deliverer , and with Theba 's aid you may become tyrant of I'herae ; for some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Theba I was stirred with no desire , though I pitied her much as she knelt at my feet , her colors strangely streaked and blended by her tears . Nor did any wish to be tyrant move me ; for I saw , only too plainly , that the fortress which tyranny builds for itself is but a prison , doorless save to a tomb . Why lose my freedom to make slaves of others ? And so " If your brothers are threatened , " I said , " let your brothers strike . " " They are cowards ; they dare not , " she murmured . " And alone I can not carry it through . " " The more they are cowards the more they must do it , " I told her . " Let cowardice scourge them to it . For I will not undertake it . I will neither stab him as he sits at his drink nor by midnight murder succeed to his place  --  though Theba invites me . " A flush of anger reddened her neck and burned under her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Will you betray me ? " She arched back like a serpent in its coil . " I ' . ' ill denounce you to him as an accomplice . He will make no question , credit no denial . Then we shall both die , shrieking , together . " " Be still , " I commanded her . " If you lift your voice till some other hears , you were better unborn . Speak no more of ' betrayal  --  though with such a secret you have put me in  | peril , unasked . I would gladly see him dead , and now my own safety demands no less . I will aid you , but not with the knife . Lash your brothers to action ; the day is short . " Her bosom heaved , but with steady eyes she searched my face  --  and believed . " They shall do it , " she said , " and you shall give us what aid you will . Yet in you I put my trust . I will never betray you , Cylarion " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your reward shall be as you ask it . " " Let it be trusted service at good pay , " I said , " and no more . " She assented , sighing . " And now , what plan ? " I asked ; and we conferred together . While thus we whispered with perilous breath , the morning shadows grew short ; they almost pointed northward when I came forth . I summoned her brothers in haste ; they held back , but I would have no denial . She constrained them with proofs and threats , while I stood grimly by with folded arms ; they promised ; I gave them weapons and safe concealment . One thing remained , but on this all turned . The tyrant slept in an upper chamber , reached by a ladder , at the foot of which , each night , was stationed a huge guard , reputed a Thracian , with a great hound of the fiercest breed . This fellow was little seen by day , but lay , they said , in drunken slumber in a guard-room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needful either to win him over or to put him away , I sought him out . I entered softly ; the place was dark and full of foul odors . I called , " Mokus ! " ? for so he was known . The dog , chained by the wall , growled savagely ; a monstrous shape rose out of the straw and towered above me with a lifted knife , the face by the light from the doorway showing dimly against the darkness . if the Will of Apollo 37  | " Lachas ! " I cried . " By the hound , " he roared , " it is that thieving son of I Icrmogenes , and no other . " He laughed and flung aside the knife . " It makes my fingers itch , " he said , " for I have as good a will to kill you as to drink , yet can not . " I ( lid not much trust him . But my hand was now upon my sword and I had little fear , for in those days few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lachas ? " I asked him . Again he leered tipsily , for a rank welter of wine was in him . " Why , you ill-begotten whelp of Hermes , I owe you a life ; for when you were tickling my throat with a knife in yon cavern you forebore to cut . My own knife it was , you little horned imp of the woods , " and he almost choked with laughter , " with an edge that would have gone to the bone in one slash ; yet you spared me . " " And for that do you let me live ? " He gazed at me with unsteady eyes and the air of one who strives to array his wits . " Yea , comrade  --  reason enough  --  at least , when I am afflicted with any measure of soberness ; at cock-crowing that were sufficient . Yet being at present so drunk , I wonder  --  but now I have it . You pilfering brat , you stole the amulet off my neck  --  and by the crook of Hermes it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for the luck of the cavern went with it . Yet while you have it upon you , drunk or sober I can not strike , for the thing is a charm . " It was true , I had it upon me . I had kept it , though I deemed it of no account except as a trophy , and that morning , suspicious of the tyrant 's mood , by some unwonted impulse I had tied it about my neck  --  where , charm or not , it had served me well . " Now give it back , " he demanded .  | " Not yet , " I replied . " You shall earn it by service . " And venturing much , I told him the plot in fewest words . The thing tickled his fancy . " To steal his dog and his wife , " he muttered , " and with help of his own guard cut his throat in his chamber ! What other but this incontinent cub of Hermes , who stole an amulet off the neck of a thief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so luscious a jest needs no amulet . Our kind master , the tyrant , is already sick with mortal illness , though as yet he feels no pang , But doubtless some proffer of reward is made by those who will inherit from him . " " For Lachas , a talent of silver . " " It shall be mine . I weary of these sober watches by night , without comfort or company , save the dog . It is a dog 's life . A good tale shall be told of this . " And indeed , the tale of what followed has been much bruited , but with strange alterations . For some say the guard was a painted savage from Thrace , who kept by him a Thracian lion ; but in truth it was Lachas , and the beast but a dog . Now all that day the shadows under the sun swung and lengthened with such speed as I remember at no other time . We had barely finished our preparation when the tyrant rode in , with much clamor of men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as when goats are herded for slaughter . He was weary and fretful with hunger , and struck the cook with his fist because his meat seemed oversalted , yet drank the more  --  while Theba in her richest robes sat before him , seeming fair enough in the lamplight , and filled his cup without ceasing , though he scarcely gave her a look . At last he stumbled to the ladder , which he climbed with sagging steps , pushed up from behind by Lachas , who could the Will of Apollo 39  | ill conceal his mirth as he saw his master mount into the trap that was laid for him . Theba followed , but soon came daintily down , with silent tread , bearing his sword ; and this was the signal . Lachas , catching the dog by the collar and gripping its snout with his mighty hand , led the beast to its kcn nel without a sound ; and while Theba deftly twined each ling of the ladder with muffling flocks of wool , I called her three brothers , who stood belted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ascended and they after , for I would not let them linger . Slowly they climbed and vanished . At the foot of the ladder I waited with straining ears . All was mill , save a faint creaking of the planks , close over my head , and the heavy breathing of sodden sleep . Then a scuffle of fret and a bellow of rage and a groan ; and after no long interval a steady drip descended from the cracks , splashing on the floor , so near me that I moved aside . And by this I knew that the deed was done . What befell in the chamber I learned later from Theba. h ' . vcn there her brothers had flinched , but when she bent by the bed as if she would shout a warning in the tyrant 's ear , they plucked courage from desperation . Advancing to where he lay , one seized his extended arms and another his feet , while the eldest sought his liver with the knife . Three blows he struck , the second alone mortal  --  given barely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sat bolt upright , but fell back dead .  | In which is related how Lachas fulfilled his vows and how I was put to shame by a thief . From the vale of Tempe to the gates of Hellas this deed was acclaimed , and the coward hand that had struck the blow now grasped at dominion . Too weak it seemed to clutch more than the semblance ; yet he at whose wrist it dangled gazed at it in wonder , held it before him , and saying , " This is the hand that did it , " swelled with pride . But the hand was still the same , and being impotent to swing a sword , could ill wield a scepter . Soon most of the cities of Thessaly cast off the yoke of Pherae . The tribute fell , spoils there were none , and the cut-throats of Hellas began to scatter to other service . The new tyrant was scorned . Theba he feared and hated , yet at first did her will . Through her I was made captain of the guards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said she , " you will pay yourself first of any , and so much as you like . " She spoke sadly , and as always with a childish lisp . " Yet already , Cylarion , you may see by how much it had been better  --  otherwise . My brother can not rule , nor I through him . Even now that wife of his  --  such a fool as she , and of no complexion  --  is supplanting me with  | him ; to her he listens , no more to me . And now that he has learned how easy it is to kill , you were best to beware of him , ( : ylarion , and quickly make good your reward . For I can do little to aid you , as things are ; and you , I think , have no wish to make them  --  different . " She seemed fairer than when I had seen her sporting with the tyrant , yet to me she still was as a spotted adder , a venomous thing , not to be touched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " No , " she said , " the thanks are still to you ; but you , I think , have eyes only for silver . " And with that she turned away , nor did she ever come to me again . For the jealous schemes of the tyrant 's wife  --  he himself was nothing  --  I cared less than the echo of a curse ; but my post was not easy as the pay became scant , and the men , such as remained , grew riotous with discontent . So , mindful of ' I heba 's counsel , putting away some store of silver from what was in hand , I too began to cast a look abroad for other service . Meanwhile all Pherae was full of the noise of Lachas spending his talent . For he had said : " I will now pay my debt to the god , who has been long-suffering and very patient of my shameless appetite ; for I , no less than he , love the tongues of hulls , and I have many times eaten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good and the pleasure of money is but the spending of it , he shall have full payment , with usury , lest he weary of inc and ill luck follow ; and when my account is thus cicared and I owe him nothing , I will henceforth be more discreet in this matter of vows . I will vow but the bones and the entrails , which I value not , yet deem as good as better to burn to a god ; and the horns and the hoofs I will devote to Pan , lest he trouble me in the woods . Thus shall I make a  | good bargain at no loss ; but first I will pay my debt as becomes an honest thief . " Thus he discoursed in the market , buying cattle with lavish hand , while a great throng gathered about him and trailed his steps. - 'Then , followed still by the crowd and leading an ass loaded with sacks of wine , he drove the cattle before him into an open space , where lay many stones . Here with lewd jests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but most remained . Then , having splashed out a libation and prayed profanely to the god of thieves , bidding all take note of his piety , he offered a hecatomb to Hermes and feasted all corners with roasted meat and raw wine from the sacks , spilling as he poured . Twenty tongues of beeves he burned on that impious altar  --  after which , heaping it high with wood , he laid on such masses of offal that a reek as of pestilence tainted the air as it smouldered . And when this at last was consumed he slew the dog , which lay by the altar gorged with meat , and with sacrilegious solemnity offered that also , " to guard , the shade of the dead , " he said , " in its chamber below . " Whereat some others made haste to depart , fearing the wrath of Persephatta . Then sending men with asses for more of the wine , which still he poured without stint , slitting the necks of the sacks as the mob pressed upon him bearing all manner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a tumult that the citizens barred their doors and the tyrant fled to his inmost refuge . Not even with nightfall did the clamor end . They rioted under the stars , ever feeding the fire with fresh faggots , and some houses they burned with brands snatched from the altar  --  unchecked , for so few were left under arms that I was loath to lead them forth , fearing lest they too join the By the Will of Apollo 43  | revelers  --  of whom , when morning dawned , such a multitude lay prostrate about the streets that the town had the look of a city taken by storm after stubborn resistance . I left Taxiotas , the only one of the officers whom I felt I could trust , in charge of the men , with orders to herd in the stragglers as they roused  --  for they would be tame enough now  --  and slipping the amulet round my neck I sought out Lachas . I found him in the guard-room , sprawled on the straw and snoring loudly ; yet he leaped up at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was distorted with terror , but relaxed as he saw me . " Is it you ? " he said . " By the gods of the pit , I am glad you aked me , for I was dreaming unhappily . " You well might . " " Belike , but it is not my custom . Yet I stood before that Pet scphatta in the house of Hades , and that three-snouted hound of Styx had me by the ankle , and the face of the goddess was grim and of no sweet omen . I have not felt such fear since I was a brat and was told of Empusa . " He rubbed his ankle . " The accursed beast held hard , with teeth like spikes ; but I think it is healed with waking . " " Lachas , " I said , " you have done well ; you have surpassed yourself . You have made the name of Mokus a glory in Pherae . " " Mokus ? ? yes , it is now Mokus , but that may well be changed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that of which you speak , but the thing eludes me . Not within memory have I been so fogged with drink . I had made some purchase of cattle , I think ; and I was impelled to acts of piety , was I not ? Rarely have I been so drunk . " " ' Twenty head of choice bullocks you burned to Hermes as the patron of thieves , with most impious rites ; and with 44 By the Will of Apollo  | the stench of the offal you have gathered all the flies from Egypt , and a swarm of men scarce fewer or more to be desired , whom you feasted with sacrilegious meat and so drowned in wine that they lie like logs beside a river after flood . I have by me barely fifty fit for service . " He gasped . " Think of it , comrade ! I stood beneath the moon at the head of a thousand men ; had I been less deep in wine I might have sacked the city , and no ill jest , either , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ass-load of wine . But I have been wasteful of opportunity , and of wine and meat no less . Those fellows were not worthy of it , comrade , and I doubt they observed the decorum of such an occasion . " " They howled and danced like Thracian savages , " I told him , " with such a bellowing of bulls and men as terrified the tyrant . " " And all to no profit , " he sighed . " But at least , I am glad that my debt to the god is now paid . It had troubled me , comrade ; such a thing it is to be piously reared ! But , comrade , in this access of pious zeal did I not do some mischief to the dog ? Else why did I dream of such a thing as Cerberus ? And I can not find the clog . " " That , " I said , " was the worst , and some of your godforsaken rabble sobered and fled when they saw it . For , catching the beast by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strained back his head and cut his throat , and with such prayers as made men wish for lids to their ears , you devoted his blood to the shade of the slain tyrant .

" y the Will of Apollo 45  | " He will bid me break your bones on the wheel . You can not stay , and of this I am come to warn you . " Cylon , " said he ? " since so you are called , and for a thief the name is well chosen  --  again I owe you a life ; and although I deem you somewhat of the nature of a daemon , as being a misbegotten cub of Hermes , this debt shall not be repaid as a vow to a god , with the burning of offal , but shall be honored as due from a thief to a thief . I will go , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of firs . For though I may deal with six or eight of common stature , I can not stand against a line of leveled spears . Yea , I will go , and noon shall not see me within these gates ; but first , for better luck , give me my amulet . " I laid it in his open hand , which closed upon it ; then he strove to cast it down , yet could not , for it seemed to cleave to his palm . He soon ceased . " I have done ill , " he said , " but it is idle to contend with a charm " ? and hung it about his neck . " What new trouble is this ? " I asked . " I gave it freely . " " Yea , Freely ; and so I received it , as a gift , and am bound by its magic . " " To me , do you mean ? " " Yea , to your service . I had hoped you would not ask that , nor discover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have made a mistake . I lad I wrested it from you , as at first I intended , all would be well ; or if I had taken it by theft , as you did , or had it by purchase , as from the hag that made it . And here is the remedy : take it back that I may buy it of you ; for when sleep overtook me I had not yet been able to spend all my talent , and I will pay a fair price , more than its cost . " " Take it back ? " I cried . " Not I. Who then would be mas46 By the Will of Apollo  | " Then , " said he slowly , " you have your will , and I am under the yoke . I might have known that you would not be duped . Yet so much I will say : to you , of all that range the hills , daemons or men , I would soonest be bound , if this must be . " Beyond the door I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the tyrant had summoned me . " Lachas , " I said , " be free . I have but one command : flee to the mountains . " " I am gone already , " he answered , " yet am free only as a runaway slave , who must still fear a master . " As he spoke , pushing away the straw , he lifted a trap in the floor and fled through a dusky passage under the castle , known to few . I replaced the hatch , kicked back the straw , and went out . I found the tyrant pale with anger and tremulous from recent fright . He assumed an air of sternness , reproved me like a fretful old man berating a servant , and bade me seize and bring before him the profane malefactor whose riot had disturbed the city . I told him that the man had not been seen since early dawn , and called in Taxiotas , who confirmed me . It was very unlikely , I said , that the fellow had returned within the walls , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , closing the gates and entering houses , to the great vexation of many citizens , who cursed the tyrant under their breath , fearing for their goods . And not only was Lachas not to be found but with him had vanished five others , whom I esteemed no loss . Not many days after , I learned by a message from Theba that Taxiotas , in whom I had somewhat confided , had denounced me to the tyrant , that he might supplant me , so that I stood in imminent danger ; whereupon I too fled , using the secret passage under the hatch in the guard-room , where I  | had already hidden a sack of silver as heavy as I could well carry . Much impeded with this I groped far in the smothering gloom , for the passage was long and crooked , and in places so low that I was forced to crawl backwards , dragging the sack . I wondered not a little how Lachas had ever wallowed through , but the thought was reassuring , for where he could pass I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in by a heavy door , which I could not stir by any effort . Banded with metal and studded with spikeheads it seemed , but I could find neither latch nor bolt and was near despair , when at last , by a lucky fumble , I touched its secret and it swung outwards . So , sweating and breathless , I stepped forth into the starlight , and the sweet , cool air of night laved my body like flowing water . I found myself standing beyond the walls in a copse of holm oaks under a ledge , yet so near the battlements that I heard the tinkling bell of the watch as it circled above . As yet there was no alarm , but I hastened away , finding the sack a grievous burden , until , about midnight , rousing a countryman and stilling his fright with double payment , I bought an ass ; after which I made such progress that by morning I had reached the little town called Phylaka , close by the mountains . Here I bought bread and wine and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my knife ; but without pausing to eat or drink I hurried on to the foot-hills , which I climbed by steep trails through thickets and woods  --  none too soon . For looking back from a bushy ledge , I saw in the plain below a troop of horse , led , I surmised , by Taxiotas ; but he did not attempt the hills , and the better for him , as I think he suspected . So secure did I feel that I refreshed myself with food and drink as I watched my pursuers ; and when they came nearest and halted under the hill , gazing  | upward in doubt , I was tempted to shout down to them in defiance , but was not so rash , for they might have dismounted and given me trouble . Indeed , being in some uneasiness lest the ass begin braying , I quickly started on and lost myself among the mountains . Then , as night began to darken the forest , tying the ass to a tree I slept on a pallet of moss and leaves . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the silver , but bread and wine and a flitch of dried goat 's flesh lay beside me . By this I suspected that Lachas was near , and after a little he came before me , leading the ass , his look sheepish . I barely gave him a glance and resumed the barley cake I was eating . " What a thing is this , " I said , " to rob a comrade ! Have you no regard for oath or amulet ? " " Captain , " he answered humbly , " the charm works only by your will , and this you never forbade ; by the hound , I had no command not to rob you . Yet the deed , viewed as an exposition of honesty and fair dealing among thieves , was not , I admit , well conceived , though as a jest excellent and no more than your due for what was clone in the cavern . " He seemed eager to excuse himself . " Indeed , Captain , unless it might be in the planning , the deed was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they would have capped the jest with the cutting of your throat , I opposed them with such vigor of argument that they are now in no fit case to appear before you , and for that reason I have come alone . " I was vexed ; it stirred my spleen to seem in anything indebted to him . " For that no thanks , " I said . " Already you owed me a life . It is paid ; let the match stand even . I once robbed you and you have robbed me . Begone ! " He grew sullen and turned away , but faced about . " It is not that I greatly care for the silver , " he muttered , " save in By the Will of Apollo 49  | the taking , as one who hunts for sport but cares less for the pelts . Comrade , I am sorry for this ; I might better have borne some measure of injustice than offend you . But the fault is yours ; for although you have sworn our oath , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with us by fair allotment but kept all . " I Lis words startled me . With new eyes I saw myself no Fetter than a bandit , less to be trusted than Lachas . I sprang to my feet . " You are right ; I commend you , " I cried . " You have but robbed a thief of his spoil . " " Yea ; and there is the very mischief of it , " he said . " It was tank indiscretion and subversive of discipline to rob our own captain ; but I have brought you your share by just division . " He cast a bag of silver at my feet . " I have divided all , " said he , " into four parts , and of these I set aside one for ou , and each of the others I halved for the rest of us , to every man his fair portion , since the captain of right takes a double share . " " Captain ! " I cried . " How else ? I have plainly informed them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to aid remembrance , that you are truly the captain and I but your deputy in absence . It could not now be otherwise , because of the charm . " It was idle to say to him that I was no brigand ; far wiser to humor his fancy . " Then call me captain if you will , and be ' till my deputy . For I can not stay . I am fleeing southward , to hebes , if my purpose holds . " " I thought it likely . You cry on the scent of blood like a hound , and will find much satisfaction , belike , in this war which is stirring against those Phocians , who are making fat spoil of Apollo 's temple . What a booty is yonder ! " he said  | thirstily , licking his lips . " Unless at Susa , nowhere else is such store of gold . But make no such error as to go to Thebes . Take service rather with the Phocian , who already offers double pay ; and if you bid me I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deem it wiser to stay . For south of the Gates that portentous affliction which men call law is rife in all the cities , and this to men of liberal spirit becomes a menace and a great annoyance  --  while here in Thessaly there is little law , and these mountains are free and lawless altogether . " " Keep to the mountains , " I told him , " and by no means seek to follow . " And so we parted  --  without ill-will , yet with relief to both . The bag of silver which he had brought I deemed rightly mine , no more than was justly due me for service ; and my heart , as well as the back of the ass , was much lightened now that the rest had gone to such as were thieves by profession . With such thoughts I passed on through the hills , crossing the heights by the rough path over Anopaea , for the pass by the sea was closely guarded ; and thus , without further adventure , I came to Thebes . These things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any pride , but that men hereafter may know the truth . For a slander has gone abroad concerning me , that I was once a leader of brigands and in that way got most of my wealth ; and this has sometimes been cast at me . But that tale arose through the misguided zeal of Lachas and those whom he led , who would ever be saying that I was their captain , ascribing to me all the credit of their deeds . But I was not with them , nor was I their captain except in name ; and my wealth  --  which you , Apollodorus , will so soon inherit  --  has been honestly won as spoils of war and rewards of service . Such is the truth of this matter .  | In which is related how I prayed to Apollo and what fortune I had in a casting of lots . I have heard that once there was a war in heaven among the gods , of all wars the worst . How such a thing could be and what it might mean let rhapsodists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , that of wars among men those waged in the name of a god are least human , as was quickly shown in that in which I now took service ; for of all the wars called " sacred " ? and these are ever the most devoid of piety or pity  --  I deem it the most merciless and empty of profit or honor . Its beginnings I will not presume to discuss  --  whether that pious council of men from many cities , called Amphict yonic , which from of old has watched over the shrine of Apollo , was just or unjust in the harsh sentence proclaimed against the men of Phocis for the plowing of what was said to he consecrated ground . This , indeed , seems to be a debatable matter , since my own city , and Sparta no less , at first sided with Phocis , thinking that decree little else but an act of spite prompted by Theban jealousy , and deeming the Amphictyons good men of religion , yet unduly excitable and little skilled in the ways of politicians . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Phocians , thus brought to des-51  | peration , had seized the oracle of the god and his temple and all its treasure , and built a wall about Delphi , and melted the gold of Apollo 's gifts to pay the charges of war , their sacrilege then became manifest and all Hellas cried out upon them . I had not taken the advice of Lachas . For although hitherto I had given no great heed to the gods , being in this no better than others who dwell in camps and whose bread is kneaded with the spear as some poet has said , my gall rose against these impious wretches and I deemed their gold accursed . For no pay would I serve them ; ' but after a season of waiting I enrolled against them in the army of Thebes , rendering perilous service for scanty wages grudgingly paid . For this war , ill conducted and unending , was like no other in bitterness . Deeming the enemy no honorable foes but malefactors abhorrent to gods and men , we gave no quarter , granted no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flung to dogs and kites . We ourselves fared as ill ; maddened and desperate , they fought like wolves , sparing none , and to wolves they left the slain . So war became massacre , no fair contest of arms , and from each camp many deserted , but most from us , for the pay was mean and the hazard excessive . In commanders the enemy had the advantage ; strong men they were , who ruled with undebated sway , which in war is much . First Philomelus , who , being bold and resourceful , soon made himself tyrant in the city of the god ; for in such an hour one man must be master and tyrants thrive . A gallant leader he was and much loss he caused us ; but at last , defeated and encircled , he reined his horse on the verge of a precipice , a sheer descent of fifty fathoms , and sooner than suffer capture he plunged and died . By the Will of Apollo 53  | By his death we gained less than nothing ; for Onomarrhus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his brother 's forces and seized his power . And then it was that I had a great adventure , full of wonder and peril , which lifted me out of that ungrateful service and changed my life . There were three of us , hardened veterans of many marches , and we had been sent out as spies , making Apollo our pretext with some vain question to the oracle . For at this time Pherae , ever changing its tyrants , was ruled by Lycophron , who had promised aid to the Phocians ; and Philip , now for some six years king , had invaded Thessaly , pro ( 'aiming himself champion of the god , then as ever making shrewd use of the feuds of Hellas . Hence our general , doubtful as to the purpose of Onomarchus , whether or not he meant to march against Philip , had devised this plan of sending spies into his very stronghold . Thus far we had come quite boldly , with jesting and little thought ; but when the shadows of the mountain were about its , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grew steep toward Delphi , we , halted , leaning upon our spears . For now , as we stood in view of those menacing battlements high on the cliff , the scheme seemed untoward , and the peril no fair risk of service but out of measure . Here the tyrant had gathered about him the worst in Hellas , such as lie alone could curb , men of no city and broken fortunes , ready to lift their spears against the gods in heaven for him who would pay ; and with ten thousand of these he held this fortress , defying gods and men . And the mercy of Onomarrhus was the mercy of the Medes , for he was adept in all their cruelties , to which were added Thessalian treachery and Macedonian riot ; yet in shrewdness he was a Greek of the Greeks . And to go before him spying , with a shallow tale of consulting the oracle ?  | " Comrades , " I cried , " it is to snatch meat from under the jaws of Cerberus . But to venture three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If a viper must needs be caught by the tail , one man is better than three ; to him it is no worse and the rest may live . For by casting lots , who shall go , there will be to each man two chances of life against death , which , for picked men of the front rank , is no more than a fair hazard of service on occasion . " To this they found no answer ; so , when we had cursed a little at him who had brought us to this pass , we prayed , making vows to the god , and marked each man his pebble . And he who prayed loudest was Bias , and he who vowed the richest gifts was Bardys . But going apart , as wishing to speak more privately into the ear of Apollo " Great Lord of Delphi , " I prayed , " be well advised in this matter . For men say that from yonder rock no ambush is hidden , and the marches of tomorrow , to thee , are known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this shall prove an affair of little import let Bias be chosen , and if it be mere waste of life take Bardys , for he is old ; but if it be of great import , needing both hardihood and wit , then choose the best , come what may ; but forget not him who serves . " Now whether the god gave ear to this you may judge the better when all is told . But I , turning back , dropped my pebble into the helmet of Bias , and they too their pebbles . " And who , " I asked them , " shall make the cast ? Agree together , that we may have no dispute later over the fairness of the casting , to imperil all with a second trial . And I name Bardys , as being eldest . " But they answered , " You , Cylon , for yours was the plan . " So I shook the helmet and the pebbles rattled within , while they , sitting upon the sand , ground their nails into the By the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaped out and fell in the dust . And he who caught it up was Bias , but dropped it quickly , crying , Not mine . " Then Bardys  --  and turned it and wiped his eyes and looked again , crying , " Not mine , " in the voice of one drawn from the water far spent . Whereupon I , letting fall t he helmet , stooped for the pebble ; and I held it as one holds hard on a spear sunk in his side , for the mark upon it was my own . But when I found voice , " Remain here , " I said , " till midnight ; then , post-haste to the camp . You may report that the tyrant would admit but one ; he turned you back , hence you are blameless . And listen : if it be possible , go before the generals and bid them march quickly for sudden assault . For this is my only hope , if anything be left for hoping . " And they , " But how shall we be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the captain , and use some unning ; let the plan seem his . It is thus : the tyrant will think they wait my coming ; he will toy with me as a cat with a clawed mouse , and fearing nothing will not refrain from his pleasure ; and if , while he is sunk in his drink , you storm the wall , the rest without direction will be as a herd of bulls for Apollo 's altar . So shall my forfeit serve the god . " " May Apollo guard you , " they cried . " The god has chosen wisely . " " Yes , wisely  --  unless it be waste . For the feeding of dogs t here are some of less wit as heavy of carcass . " And I strode away vexed at this praise of the god , for I doubted that he had given the matter due attention . But t hey ran after me into the open road , and we took each other by the hand . So we parted , thinking to meet no more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to Delphi , for who i n Hellas has not rubbed its stony steeps with weary feet ? Yet  | I saw no pilgrims ; already the oracle was deemed of most men the voice of Onomarchus , not of Apollo . Vines that sprawled across the track entangled my feet , and where any trickle of moisture came , grasses waved from the wheel ruts , though crushed a little , as if a single chariot had lately passed . At length I reached that place where , beside the way , the gates of the House of Hades stand figured upon the cliff , amid tombs of those long dead . And here a strange thing befell . For at sight of so ill an omen I paused and invoked the god , and while I stared upon it in dismay  --  you will say that I dreamed , and indeed it was like a dream , yet I stood in open day grasping my spear and felt the dust of the road beneath my feet . But as 1 called upon Apollo the ominous symbol faded from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of it shone a face , as of a maiden , glimmering in the very rock ; it came and went in the stone like a face that sinks and rises in dark waters . Then , as I gazed , it flashed forth in full color and gleaming with light ; for though the hair on either side fell in masses that seemed of the substance of night , the cheeks were tinted like the evening glow , starlit between . Soon it paled and vanished under the scales of the - ock , which again showed the symbols of death ; but fear was now lost in wonder . For I knew , in an instant I knew with full conviction , that this was the face I had seen in my dream ? many times , in the dream that waking I could not remember ; yet in sleep thus it had shone in my eyes . What it might portend I could not guess , but I deemed my prayer well answered ; and where this might lead I would go , even to the gates of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the tyrant in Delphi and whom I beheld there . I hastened on with better speed , surprised that I met no outpost . Presently I was at the gate with which the tyrant had closed the summit of the approach , where , still unchallenged , I beat upon its bolted planks with the stock of my spear . Now this was sheer folly and savored of Boeotian insolence , to stand in arms , unheralded , before a fortress gate ; and so it seemed to those within , for from the bastion beside it an arrow whistled by me , so close that it nipped the edge of my ear . But with that came a shout of laughter ; and when I had called for the captain a little door swung out at the foot of the tower , and there I entered stooping , dragging my spear . I rose up amid armed men in a guard-room , thronged and dim . " Speak , " said a voice from among them , " and to some purpose , else the crows are waiting for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steam of raw wine was rank in my nostrils . I had a wiser thought than to speak here of oracles . " I have a message , " I said , " for the tyrant 's ear . To him I will tell it . " " By the corpse of Bacchus , " the man called back , " I will not answer for it . He is engrossed and vexed already with 57  | this godly embassy from Lacedaemon about Apollo 's shrine  --  may hogs wallow in it ! That he may hoist you on a pole to howl for the ease of death is little to me , but if through us you are brought before him to babble follies he is like to flay our backs . " He pressed forward and came to my side . " Good youth , is it anything else but this , that you seek service ? Then by no means trouble the tyrant . I will enroll you . The pay is liberal , and for you I will make light charges ; for the price of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brawn and your impudence too . " But I looked him in the eye . " Forty horse , " I told him , " wait my call beyond the hills . " For my plan was shaping . " Forty horse  --  but I will make my own terms and have pledges . " " Pledges ! " cried he ? " god 's death , what pledge but his pleasure ! But , Mother of Bacchus ! if you have horse at call it may chance he will hear you . Yea , for horse I will venture you in , but curse not me if he horses you on a stake . " Now here was a notable matter if with any celerity the generals might be apprised of it ; for why should the tyrant seek horse unless for the plains ? And I said in my heart , " It is Thessaly ; he will march , and for this he gathers horse . " And so , having gained my end , I would fain have spared his leisure , but found no present means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my spear , led me quickly to the tyrant 's dwelling  --  a great house splendidly garnished , partly with spoils from Apollo 's temple as I surmised . Here , amid many whispers , I was conducted to a spacious chamber , where I was bidden to abide the master 's convenience . While I waited the place grew dark , for the day was waning , and a servant came and set a little lamp on a stand , and beside it a tall beaker of wine , hotly spiced , so that the By the Will of Apollo 59  | odor filled the room and my palate tingled . But I stood by the wall , obscure in the shadow of the golden beaker ; for the lamp , flat and low , lay behind it . Then came the tyrant with heavy steps and sat alone by the wine ; yet beyond the door I heard the click of spears as the butts were dropped to the marble floor . " Now , " I thought , " is the time , and delay perilous . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raised his eyes , and I checked as though a hand had been laid on my breast . It was toward the door that his eyes were turned ; they were small , deep sunk in sodden flesh under bulging brows , but restless as the twinkle of stars . His face was broad and swollen , the nose wide , yet reaching down with the cast of a buzzard 's beak . Beneath stretched a mouth like a red slash cut with a knife , clamped shut by a chin as broad as the brow , beset with a swinish stubble of bristles . His frame was unwieldy , lumped with brawn padded in fat . Hard faces I had seen in many camps , but none like this . And while I looked upon him the great cleft of his mouth opened and he called , " Lead her in , " so loudly that the brimming wine jarred with the sound ; then , more softly , in a voice like crushed honey , as thick and cloying , " Rise , maiden , and be at ease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And I saw , kneeling before him , the vision that came and went in the rock  --  that very maid , clad in a trailing robe of purple which in the lamp-light shadowed to black ; but for the deeper blackness of her hair , I would have called it black . But the radiance of her face no lamp could subdue ; rose and lily it glowed , and like the lily her head was bent . When she spoke , after the rumbling tones of the tyrant , her voice came like a whisper , yet such a whisper as commands the ear amid tumult .  | " Sire , " she said , " I am not afraid ; yet I am the last of three chosen to speak Apollo 's truth , and the two were grown old in the wisdom of the god . Where are these , that you now bid a novice speak from the tripod ? " He heaved with anger , yet spoke with smothered breath . " Old in insolence , not in wisdom . Was it Apollo 's wisdom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , those two , by the way appointed for such as dishonor the god . Well you know their punishment , and well for you that you know . " " I know " ? and her voice was lifted . " Entombed alive , they went to a living death . Have I not seen them through this crust of earth , which to Apollo 's eye is but a film , like ice that crusts a pool ? Alive they crossed the dark waters , and the boat swam low . " Her face whitened , her hair streamed back as if there were wind . " And alive I see them now , far down in the cavern of ghosts . Alive they kneel before the throne of death , and lift up living hands that gleam amid the shadows ; and the face of her who sits upon the throne is changed , and her frown is darker than the shadows . " He shuddered , sweating cold dew that glistened on his brow , but broke forth : " By all daemons of the pit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ softness , " The two are gone , whither your searching eye has seen , and thence , alive or dead , none rise ; mark that . The one remains , to voice Apollo 's oracle in wiser words ; of her  --  because she is a novice and not yet hardened in presumption  --  I have hope . Now let the novice give ear , and she shall have honor , and pleasures too , under the smile of him who rules ; the god shall show favor to her who serves him well from the tripod . Know that envoys are come , envoys from worshipful Sparta , seeking to know from the very lips of the oracle if the god is truly free and sanctions our acts in defense of his temple ; By the Will of Apollo 61  | and by this they will shape their policy . They love the Thebans as little as we ; if Apollo bids they will march . And the day is tomorrow , and the tongue that speaks is your own . Do you understand me ? If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shrine , we are first in Hellas and you first in my favor ; but if ill words break from your lips you shall go to the place your eyes have seen and no god shall help you , though you too lift pale arms before the throne of darkness . Speak  --  for your face is a mask of linen , as silent as your tongue . " Again the color flowed in her cheeks and her eyes leaped light . " I understand you well . I will speak as I am bidden . I will voice the oracle aright ; I will proclaim the honor of the god . " Now whether the tyrant was shrewder than I , or less shrewd , will presently be seen ; for to me this answer seemed a dubious thing , itself much like an oracle , but to him full satisfaction . And this , I conceive , is the very art of oracles , to speak truly and speaking the truth to deceive . " The novice , " said he , " is the wisest of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the capering goats . Apollo 's shrine shall spill jewels upon her ; she shall have her will , and god 's queen shall sulk on Olympus in envy of her . " He raised the goblet ; the light of the lamp streamed full in my face . He turned  --  and the wine fell flooding on the floor . " A spy ! " he shouted . " A spy  --  and tonight ! By the hound of Styx , he shall ride the stake and howl his message to the crows . " Now this was a time for quick thought . I set my hand to my car and spoke in dull tones without accent . " Yea , my lord , for such service I came , and the pay you name is sufficient . I will gladly ride for you by night , and spy  | as well as I may , or bear any message  --  so it be written . I am not so ill to hear , my lord , when I am roared at thus . " And with this I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but with laughter . " By the god of all liars , fellow , this deafness is well thought of ; with another it might pass . Not here . Now find your ears and answer without further evasion . Did you hear my speech with this maiden ? " I dropped my hand . " My lord , to another I might say I heard nothing ; to you I say I heard , but cared not . What is it to me that you fright a maid with threats , or buy with jewels ? I am one who seeks service and no spy . " " Why , then , are you found spying ? " " My lord , I did but stand where they set me to wait your coming , and ill enough at ease . It may be that you will believe me in this , that I feared to move an eyelash . " " Your eyes have seen too much to see tomorrow . But if not a spy , what errand brought you here ? My captains deal with such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was like flight unarmed before pursuing spears ; I was breathless , but found no pause .

" " My lord , men of service make little account of age and much of wit . " " Your wit has harmed you . I had thought , a moment since , to give you easier ending , but for these forty horse you ride the stake . Nearer than Thessaly there are no horse ; I know it . The land is drained . You would bring me forty chimaeras ; you shall ride for them all . " By the Will of Apollo 63  | lie was rising , but checked at sight of the maid . I strode before him and laughed in his face with the insolence of desperation . " Are there no horse , " I asked , " in the army of Thebes ? Thence I come . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lie is the truth . He flung back in the creaking chair and searched my face , his own like an actor 's mask . " A desertion ? They propose a desertion ? What moves them to it ? Tell me that . A clever lie , but it will not save you . " " My lord , men of service serve for pay . From Thebes our pay is poor , with heavy arrears and small expectation . Call it what name you will  --  we seek a better paymaster . " " Aye , it might well be true . I like your cleverness , fellow ; if I could trust you , you should win me cities . But you are lying for your life . By your own confession you are not to be t rusted . " Now in truth my heart had leaped to a sudden scheme to bring picked men within his wall under this pretext and so seize the gates . But I answered : " My lord , there are traitors in every city . The bold use them ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the god 's own truth , and I will spare you the stake and all torment . " He paused . " But it is safer to kill you . " While we debated thus , with lies and cunning , the maid stood in the chamber , still as a statue , it lacked little forgotten of both . She now advanced , her dark robe fluted with shadow , and again she spoke : " Sire , you have promised much ; grant this , his life . " He scowled upon her . " Not yet ; it is yet to be earned . Tomorrow ask what you will . " " But if he be dead ? "  | " He tells no tales . Ask anything but this . " " This I ask , and this you shall grant . Do you think to force my tongue with threats ? It shall sooner be torn from its roots . So shall the Spartan return unanswered . " " May the Gorgon blight you ! Would that Apollo spoke through oaks or in sounding brass  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dodona is wiser . " " This the last Pythia asks  --  by your own act the last . Beneath the shining vault that roofs the world of men tomorrow 's sun will show no other . Shall the Spartan go unanswered ? " " Gods ! You shall speak , else the hounds of Cocytus are baying for you . " " They are baying , deep-mouthed , but not for me . Boar , do you whet your tusks ? you shall need them . Again I ask you , shall the Spartan return unanswered ? " " Do you presume to tempt my anger ? " He breathed hard , struggling between rage and prudence . " Even so , I am loath to harm Apollo 's priestess . " " Do I seem to fear you ? Though you send me too , before my time , to seek my own in the gloom below , is anything hid in that darkness so evil as Onomarchus ? I am not concerned with your anger ; I demand your answer . " He sat in silence ; I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fleece of a flea . And she  --  she stood before him like Persephatta , her face as pale and as cold . At last he smote the table with his hand , so that the lamp leaped and the flame fluttered . " By the sports of Apollo and all the sweet wantons of the court of heaven , have your will . " He laughed grossly . " I see you take me at my word , and by the snare of Hephaestus I  | commend your choice . A lusty youth , shapely and tall and of a cheerful wit  --  and I doubt not , apt in the arts of wooing by the practice of many camps . He shall be at your service ; but for the present I will hold him by me , well guarded . " " Think as you will , " she said ; " a heart so black can not think white thoughts . But tomorrow let this youth stand before me unharmed ; for his hand and no other shall lift me to the tripod , else the oracle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Pythia , last of her line . So it shall be . Now go forth quickly by the door that opens under the curtain . " Then , turning , he called , " Shackles , and a double guard . And let scouts range the roads below . "  | A soldier would sleep , I think , on the bed of that Procrustes of whom they tell ; and I , though cramped with chains and confounded with contending thoughts , slept like a bedded stone and dreamed as little . It was morning when I woke , though the light crept but faintly into the cell where I lay , and a burly Thessalian stood beside me with bread and sour wine of the camp ; and when my fetters were loosed , and I had rubbed the numbness from my ankles and stamped my feet into better life , I ate what was offered with some lust of appetite , for I had tasted nothing since my parting with Bias and Bardys . The rough trooper then bade me follow . " And see that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " else I am to club you into dumbness . " So we marched in silence , he beside me with a heavy staff , behind us twenty spears in double file . The sun fell at our backs , but my eyes were narrowed with the gleam of marble , for a shining line of statues bordered the way , and beyond glittered a city of temples . Distrustful of the tyrant 's purpose and eager to know more , I neglected the warning of my guide . " Do we go ? " I began . By the Will of Apollo 67  | " We go ; let that suffice . " " But , man , I need ? " " A touch of the staff . " And it dropped on my head , not with any weight of swing , yet with such a jar of the skull as filled my eyes with a shimmer of statues leaping up from t heir shadows , for the thing was no toy . After this I meddled no further with words , deeming the time inauspicious , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he bade enter , for this was Apollo 's temple . Within , the dusky vestibule was thronged with men , and among them blazed the tyrant , more crimson than his robe , like a red fire under the shadow of trees . But on that day the tyrant was less regarded , for on one who stood near him , yet a little withdrawn as if in scorn , fell the brunt of all glances . Ile was old , gaunt , clad in a tunic of coarsest weave much stained with travel ; yet flung over all was such an air of more than royal arrogance as vexed the heart , and by this I knew Ile was Spartan . Under his eye the tyrant seemed but a blustering braggart , a thing to be cowed and driven . Here I lingered short space , for a white-robed servant of t he temple took me by the hand to lead me on . As we came to the doorway I noted that the wall was fretted with many inscriptions embossed in letters of gold , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but heeded them little , being distracted with other cares ; yet one so shone out that its words seemed uttered to the eye , and this I read : " Dare thy fate . " And I said in my heart : " What is fated even Zeus must abide ; but a man may blench or brave all , and by that he is judged . " So , with somewhat less of dismay , I passed on into the greater hall of the temple . It was empty , except for those who came and went on errands of service  --  empty of men , but full of the trophies of 68 By the Will of Apollo  | the god ; not yet had the tyrant stripped it bare . To tell of these would be an endless task , and to no profit ; for if you have seen , what need , and if not , what use of words ? In the midst an altar burned with deathless flame , lighted in some forgotten age , and its smoke streamed up in filmy spires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sky . And here I saw also that rock  --  like an egg in shape and color , but seamed and streaked with strange devices  --  which they say is earth 's center , and from this to the utmost verge , east , west , or north , or south , the distance is ever the same . But my tale is not of this , nor of the eagles of Zeus that flying east and west here met , and now , all golden , stand beside the rock ; but I hasten on to tell of other things that befell in the chamber below . Yet before I left that stone I laid my hands upon it and prayed to Apollo and to Zeus . For now they led me on to an inner door where few may enter , and down a steep path of stairs into a chamber sunk in the rock , which is the very place of the oracle . And here is no light of the sun , but always a gleam of lamps amid thick shadows ; and a sound of rushing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stones tremble . In the floor is a cleft , and out of the cleft a mist rises , and in this is the power of the god . And here is the tripod , wrought of beaten gold , its feet set in sockets worn in the rock , whereon the Pythia sits while Apollo comes in the mist and possesses her tongue . But she whom I sought was not yet on the tripod , but they led me past it to the inmost nook , where a seat was cut in the wall ; and there she waited , cowering under the gloom like one who would flee but sees no way . Much abashed at her aspect , I knelt at her feet full of dread ; for the place was awesome , and I had looked to her for some comfort but now feared the worst . She signed to the others to draw back a little , and seized my hand with sudden words .  | " Oh , Cylon , I am afraid ! Hold me fast with your hand , or I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for I am afraid ! " I felt as if I were kneeling on bending ice over bottomless waters ; my head swam . But I crushed her hand , so cold and ( Inivering , in mine , and put in my voice more courage than I Iound in my heart . " Why fear  --  you who braved the tyrant and bent him to your will ? I myself was affrighted then , though danger is my trade ; and to you I owe my life . " " Speak not to me of the tyrant , " she cried . " Like the shades below he drinks blood and swells with a semblance of life , but like them he is dead already , an impotent thing . It is not the tyrant that I fear ; but to sit there " ? she gazed at the misting chasm with eyes of horror ? " shrouded within the awful presence ; to quail with the entering power of the god ; to unseat my soul to give place to another ; to he shaken with voices not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for they have told me , they that are now among the ( lead . And , Cylon " ? gripping hard my hand ? " I fear it more than death . Yet some , when the departing god had cast them down , were dead indeed . " I gazed upon her in amazement . " Thrice , " I cried , " you have spoken my name . Thrice  --  nor have heard it once , I would swear by this Apollo . " She still clung to my hand with the clutch of a frightened child , but the brassy clang of her terror softened . " No , Cylon , I have known it long . For long ago , when I was a little maid of six , standing beside the altar , and you were a boy of fourteen as I think , you came with your father to offer a goat to Apollo , and then I heard you called Cylon . I observed you closely , for I had seen no such boy as you , so tall and lithe and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and when you were gone I could see you still ; but if I reached out with  | my hand , there was nothing . And I know that my image was in your eyes that day , for you looked straight toward me , yet scarcely saw me , I think , for you were more concerned with the goat . " And here a little laugh rippled out of her wanness . " For , " said she , " it befell that the victim did not tremble as it should when the water was poured upon it , so that the omen was unpropitious and your father went away unanswered . " " It is true , by that tripod . I see it all . A little child stood by with shining eyes . It was you . And can it be ? " " That you have seen me since , in dreams ? Why should you not ? At least , my Cylon , for so in my heart I have called you , I have dreamed of you many times  --  and loved my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even in dreams . But that is not all ; for we who are chosen to speak from the tripod ? " her voice quivered to silence , but after a pause she went on ? " we that thus serve Apollo often fall into ecstasy , and then with closed eyes we see visions of things not near , and it may be of things not yet . And in such a moment I saw you , Cylon , as you came  --  yonder , in a place where there is sand by a thicket , and a lot was cast . And that was a very strange prayer you prayed to Apollo . " And I , as I heard it , feared her  --  more than cavern or tyrant or misting chasm . I would have plucked away my hand , but she clung the tighter , and the blood ran chill in my veins . Whether I spoke aloud or only in thought I can not be certain ; but ? " Are all things open to you , for your eyes to see ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she answered . " No , not all . I can only catch little glimpses , here and yonder , when the god is propitious . Those others , who now in the nether darkness seek the pale goddess , while they walked on earth saw far more clearly than I. Yet I still By the Will of Apollo 71  | followed you , Cylon , in dreamy flashes of vision , for I knew von were sent by the god to be my helper and guard ; and when you halted beside the rock I saw you plainly ; but because I feared that you too saw , I shrank away and opened my eyes and saw no more . " " But now , " I whispered , " I have seen your very self , and I would offer up my life to serve you . " " You shall ; already you do . Though I enter the tomb and lie door be sealed behind me , your arm shall guard me still . ) h , Cylon , they come ! " Her eyes flung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entering now , groping the stairway with unsteady step , and behind him the Spartan , and others followed . She spoke quickly : " Indeed you aid me , and but for you I think no word of the god would be spoken this day ; for you alone believe , you alone of them all  --  but the Spartan , and he is so hold . " " Have haste there ! " called the tyrant . " Is this a place for cooing whispers and amorous vows ? Set that gilded crock of dainty flesh on the tripod , fellow , and while the oracle smokes let it bubble words ; for we would go back to our wine . " The Spartan turned upon him with the look of iron pikes . " Meddle no more . You are drunken already . Speak not again in this presence . " She rose . " Be near me still , " she murmured ; and I lifted her to the tripod . The fume streamed up around her till her shape grew ( Mn ; I heard a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far-off moaning voice , old and broken : " Dark are the ways . Darkness and shadows are about me ; I can not see my steps . Dreadful are the paths of the dead  --  to  --  to those  --  who  | ? Oh , this is not Apollo , it is not the voice of Apollo , " she cried ; and the feet of the tripod rattled . " Have care ! " shouted the tyrant ; but again the Spartan quenched him with a look . The voice moaned on : " who behold , with living eyes  --  I will not , I will not speak for them , " she sobbed . " They die and are not yet dead . It is not Apollo . " Her voice rang out in a scream of anguish ; the tripod rose and crashed again in the sockets . Suddenly every lamp grew dim ; only the Pythia was lighted , close wrapped in a filmy mist , a gleaming shroud . Her body gasped and bent ; her face was terrible to see ; her form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not . Then came a voice that seemed the throb of falling waters shaped in words . " I speak , that am Apollo . I , that am god of Delphi , speak from a tainted shrine , whence truth shall speak no more ; for here shall I speak no more . " Spartan , give ear : a spotted hound has ravened in my sanctuary ; he has driven his swine to root and wallow about my temple ; with dripping jaws he lays his carrion upon my altar ; the mist of my oracle is foul with a stench of the murder of souls , and a cry from the cavern of death comes up through the chasm . The sacred stone of earth 's center trembles at the touch of pollution . " Woe unto you that make traffic of desecration . Woe unto Hellas , that she is faithless . Lift your eyes , for I have called to the north against Hellas ; from the north comes vengeance . I have cried against her , and out of the north shall fall a spear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the tyrant ; on him first shall it fall , and his place shall know him no more . And woe unto Thebes , that she has made my temple the toy of her malice , and her god the pretext of an By the Will of Apollo 73  | evil heart ; on her too falls the spear , and her place shall know her no more . " Woe to thee , proud Sparta ; thou art made small , and thy laws shall be forgotten . Woe unto thee , wise Athens , that thine eyes are blinded ; thou shalt sing as a slave to his mister , and he shall smite thee when he will . Woe unto all I Iellas , that she forgets her gods , and her sons that sell their birthright for a price . Desolation shall sit in her cities ; her Fields shall be dust ; the babble of children shall not be heard in her houses . " Spartan , go home to thy city ; bid it rear a wall , and trust no more to Apollo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falsehoods shall be uttered as from me ; but here my voice is heard no more , even to the end of days . Mute is my oracle , vanished the living mist of my presence . And this , tlhe last word of my truth , the last Pythia speaks  --  a Pythoness no more . " It ended wailing , and with a shriek that shook the temple ; t lien silence . The lights leaped high and flamed as in a wind ; the mist was gone ; bent and flung from its place was the tripod . White on the floor lay the Pythia  --  white and crumpled , like linen bleached on the grass . I knelt beside her , cold to fate  --  for I thought her dead  --  viewing the tyrant with dull eyes . " She has lied in the name of the god , " he shouted . " She has blasphemed god 's oracle with lies and shame . " He wheeled on the Spartan . " The god disowned her ; you heard it . He struck her down . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a blasphemer . " But the Spartan turned and strode from the chamber ; not ; i word did he speak . Then the blood of the tyrant surged , and his face became  | as a smother of coals where blue flames flicker . Like a beast that leaps with spread claws he sprang at the pallid shape that lay so still on the stones , but with such a fury of madness as matched his own I hurled him back , and my thoughts were of strangling . He reeled , and many hands were laid upon him . " It is a priestess of the temple , " voices cried , " and blood must not be shed . Already the god is much offended ; if she be alive , let all be done by the temple 's law . " As a wrestler rises breathless on a fallen foe so he mastered his rage , but his mask was warped with the wrench of effort . Under his savage look the maiden stirred , with the quiver of milk jarred in the bowl , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to outward vision . I lifted her head from the stony floor and held her up on my arm , that was hid in her hair . " Yea : let her die by the law of the temple , " he said , " like those before . " His lungs labored . " What better ? It is the darkest , slowest road of death 's anguish , for body and soul . So the god has ordained , and so shall it be . For thus it is written : Alive she shall enter the house of shadows ; she shall sit long in the silence of a living death , her bed a sepulcher , her roof a tomb , her lamp darkness . ' So shall her doom be pronounced , as of old , by the priests of the temple ; there shall be no breach of the law . " Her hand sought mine and nestled there ; his eyes glowed upon me . " And you , that I granted life to be her slave , you also . I hold by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor the sword . Nay , the slave shall still attend his mistress ; I would have the two stand together before that queen of the dead . So let Apollo 's law be fulfilled ; great is Apollo ! If indeed she speaks his truth , let him open to her a door in the By the Will of Apollo 75  | rock , for by all the dark gods of the cavern , she shall sleep tonight under a blanket of stone . But you heard it . " He turned to those about him . " The god himself denounced her as no true Pythia . " ' They were silent ; then a voice : " He denounced  --  we know lint what . It seemed the end of all . The god is incensed ; three times within the month has the earth been shaken ? and now , this ! Let us humble ourselves and pray to avert his wrath . " And some fell on their faces and prayed to : Apollo ; the tyrant cursed them , and still they prayed . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " we have sinned . It was sin to set a lying wanton on the tripod , and the god spoke in anger , as I too have spoken . Spend no more breath in prayer ; he shall be appeased , not by words , but by fitting sacrifices . Call guards ; let this blasphemer from the holy tripod and the slave who set her upon it be led to some safe cage to await my pleasure . The god shall have justice . " She looked up . " Tyrant , the god shall not have justice ? neither he nor any other . It is found no more in Delphi , nor in Hellas , nor beyond the sea . Yet in this evil age there still is vengeance . Watch well the north . " Like a horse thrice galled with a fly he snorted and stamped . " Do you still throat oracles ? Am I one to fear the Macedonian , or to quail at a goblin god that neither is nor was ? A stout soldier is your Macedonian , but a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painted mask to scare a child . A notable prank is this you have played upon us  --  at some cost , you will find . But I too have my jests and my humors . Good youth " ? his eye smote me like a lash ? " I go to make ready your forty horse . They are come . " He had no wish to linger here , neither he nor any other . 76 By the Will of Apollo  | He fled upward with a stumble on the stair , still muttering curses ; we followed , with rough hands laid upon us . As we passed through the chamber above , the air was foul with smoke ; there glowed on the altar only a waning spark , which the frightened servants of the temple strove in vain to revive .  | We lay chained in a guard-room , its brawling hushed . Instead were murmurs : " Is it not enough to fight all Hellas , hilt we must also fight the very gods ? " And others : " It may he t hat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Olympus ; but it is better to seek another service . " Whereat I thought , " I f t he generals have my message and strike tonight it will be quick work , yet for us scarce in time . " And I rolled and groaned in my chains . A soldier smote my face . " Be still ! If you cry to Apollo I will stop your mouth with the butt of my spear . " The maid had hooded her face with a fold of her robe , , iiicl lay in such silence that she scarcely seemed to breathe . I'he hours dragged heavily . As the day advanced , the place grew sultry , and the air was foul and thick . I watched a wisp of sunlight as it crept along the floor and slowly lengthened , extending itself like a shining worm . At last the tyrant came with a clatter of following spears , lurching upon a huge charger as we were brought before him . Again we stood in the glare of the sun , still hot and high , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | west . We marched far , speechless , dull of eye and thought , I dragging my chain , and she too her trailing chain . Then , with a bend of the way , we came to an open space , where the tyrant reined back and turned upon me . " Young captain of horse , behold your forty horsemen ? well mounted as you see , on Trojan steeds . We have found means to impress them into our service , and they deem the pay sufficient . Would you ride at their head ? " Before us , not twenty paces distant , I saw two tall stakes , like great spits planted upright , and fixed upon them ghastly shapes that were men . I reeled in my fetters with a faintness near death ; for from one stared Bias with slowly glazing eyeballs , from the other Bardys , in the last agony it seemed . Beneath stood an evil figure , squat and dark , directing the slaves . It was Bogas  --  who laughed aloud as he saw me , and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay idle on the sand . But the tyrant broke out upon him with curses . " Lead that foul barbarian away , " he cried , " for the sight of him curdles my stomach . " Then to me : " Know that your comrades are fully informed of your treachery and see standing beside you its price . " He too laughed , yet with little mirth . He seemed ill at ease and turned away his eyes . But to me these words were like the rip of the spur in the side of a foundering charger . I almost leaped under my load of iron . " It is false . I go to death  --  I too  --  and she . " So I cried to them . And Bias , clutching , gasped , " Aye , comrade  --  lies . " And with an oath he writhed upon the stake and died . Bardys , unheeding in his anguish , spoke no word , though I felt that with his eyes he cursed me ; but he died not yet . So from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we came to a region of shadows , where the mountain is cleft and the twin peaks rise , a deep glen where Ile hoofs of the tyrant 's horse faltered among the stones , for the way was uneasy . To him who goes farther the place becomes a gorge walled with a precipice , and out of it flow t old winds , and in the season of rain a rush of waters , but on t hat day barely a trickle . Here we halted . The tyrant rolled From his horse and again let loose his tongue . " Fair daughter of the temple , I fear you grow weary ; for the way has been long and hard and beset with sights of woe , much like the paths of those Tartarean regions , of which betimes I have heard you speak with such fervor . Even our gallant captain of troopers seems shaken ; and I myself  --  by Apollo 's vengeance , these pious oblations have spoiled my dinner and I have need of wine . " She gazed away from his scowling face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it seem a fit abode for gods . " How long , " she whispered , but not to him , " how long must I bear with this ? " " You deem me unkind ? It is true that these chains which I have bestowed upon you  --  do they gall you , Doria ? ? are of no such glittering ore as you have been wont to wear in the house of Apollo ; but do not grieve , sweet maid ; it will matter little in that darker dwelling to which you go . Be of good cheer , my priestess , for here the journey ends . See ! you have misjudged me ; I have had kind thoughts . Here I have built you a hostel of enduring stone , remote from prying eyes which lovers love not . And if you would rest , here you may sleep until all your lies are fulfilled , and none shall trouble you  --  unless , indeed , Apollo beats at your door ! But with him you know how to deal . " At Apollo 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she made no answer . As for me , the words fell empty  | on my ear . What is scoffing to one so close to death ? he has other thoughts . For I saw in the slope of the mound beneath the cliff a trench , cut deep , leading in , and at its end a doorway black with the darkness of the chamber beyond . Here the light of the sun would cease ; here all would end . To this we were led , she and I. A guardsman shook my chain . " Do we strike off this , or do they rot in irons ? " " What matter how they rot ? " Then , quickly , " But strike it off ; they shall have nothing of mine upon them . Their death is from Apollo , not from me . " So , freed from fetters , we were thrust in . The place was an ancient vault sunk in the hillside , in shape like a furnace , built of great stones banked over with earth , though at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were bringing mortar and more stone to seal the door , when the tyrant checked them ; he came to the entrance and himself pressed through . And first , while we wondered and shunned him with hasty steps , he felt the wall all about , trying the stones with his hands . None stirred , though he strained with much grunting . Then he turned , and as we felt his hot breath in our faces my hands grew tense for a grapple at his throat . But drawing away a little he called through the door " Bring food  --  yes , and drink . For so long a stay they must have some provision ; to shut them in to starve were a sin . " Then to her : " You shall bear me witness before the god that I have not harmed you ; no stain of blood , though you die , is upon me . I leave all to the god . " A slave crept in with a jar of water and sundry cakes of barley meal . These he laid on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said , " that I would taste your By the Will of Apollo 81  | bread though I famish , or touch your impious mockeries with a finger-tip ? " " Have it as you will . " He spurned the offering with his foot  --  the jar broken , the bread trampled . " You have betrayed me , yet I have spared you , because of the god . I have given you food  --  well may it serve you ! My hand is stainless of ' your blood ; no god can hold me in guilt . " Then , with lifted arms , " Lord Apollo , son of Leto , bear me witness : I hut leave her in thy hands . " He crept from the chamber ; the slaves hastened their work . And as the last stone was set she caught my hand in hers . " Oh , Cylon , thank the god ! " she cried . " Oh , thank the gods ! " " Indeed , " I said , " that he is shut out is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but that we are shut in makes the respite short  --  unless , in very truth , Apollo comes . Tell me , maid , will he come ? " For the gloom oppressed my soul and a great dread was upon me . But she answered : " How can I know ? What is right he will do . How shall I tell you his purpose that am but Doria now , my duty done , a Pythoness no more ? " And again she cried , " Oh , thank the gods ! The wall is finished and I am free . " Then I doubted , and grieved ; for it seemed some loss of joy that I had not throttled the tyrant while he stood within grasp , and the end no better . " What freedom is here , " I murmured to her , " unless we are freed by Apollo ? In the wall I find this merit , that it is not a stake  --  that and no more . But this roof  --  it weighs me down as if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Apollo ? " Now while we spoke thus they were rolling great boulders into the trench before the door and casting soil upon them ; and the fall of the stones and the clods , with the scraping of  | the shovels , was appalling to me , for under the earth such sounds bellow in the ear . And with this came such a frenzy and terror of the place we were in that I butted the wall with my shoulders , and wrested at the stones and smote upon them . And when Tor no brief space I had struggled thus , and my madness grew upon me , I groped to the maid and shook her in my hands , crying : " Will you not pray to the god ? Call aloud to the god ! " But as I grasped her thus roughly , my arms fell . Her voice laughed in my ear , yet was half a sob . I felt her hand , soft beneath my chin . " Cylon ! Would you rend me , like the very tyrant ? And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Cylon  --  that we were escaped from his hand into the hand of the god . " " Glad ! in this doorless vault ! " " And I have prayed . Indeed I have prayed , deep in my heart , that the god might save you , Cylon , while you raged at the wall and gripped so hard on my arm . But  --  listen . I think he comes . " " I hear : they are still rolling stones ; or perhaps there is thunder out under the sky . " " They are gone , long since , and no storm is raging . It is Apollo shaking the earth with his nether thunders deep under the mountains , rending asunder the rooted rocks . That sound is often heard under Delphi . He comes ! Quick , Cylon ! " She pressed me to the wall , my back against the stones , her arms about me ; our hearts smote together with heavy strokes . A rumble arose in the earth and filled the space about us ; it beat upon our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upward and fell  --  thrice it lifted and fell ; the rock of the wall crawled on my back . The darkness By the Will of Apollo 83  | seemed a thing that swayed and reeled , and all else with it . Then fell the roof from its center , with new turmoil and dusty smother , and a flash of the stars shone in . " Close  --  close ! " she cried . For around this crumbling window a great ring parted , and this too fell with din yet greater , so near that its downrush brushed our flesh and its ( lust flowed over our feet . Then the sky stood open above us , and all was still , save here and there a dropping stone . I climbed to the peak of the hill of rubbish , and a great leap brought me out ; then , flat on my face , I reached down with my hands , as into a well , while she from the hillock reached up ; and so I drew her forth . Again we stood in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and here , while a wind from the mountain , sweet with the odor of pines , blew about us and fluttered our garments , we lifted our arms and blessed the god .  | In which is related how I by falling was saved , while another fell less happily , and how we climbed Parnassus . Can you wonder , Apollodorus , that I , having thus been saved against all expectation , have ever honored Apollo beyond others ? For of other gods I know no more than what is told , which I mainly credit , yet with some lack of assurance ; but of Apollo I know , both that he is and that he has regard for such as serve him , even as I know that food strengthens the body and that spears wound the flesh . And this too I know , that he still loved Doria though he had set her free , and although she was no more his priestess he would sometimes whisper in her ear as to no other ; for she had an understanding heart and stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and above the earth there is now none like her ; and while I have honored her second only to the god , and with arm and spear have guarded her as my chiefest treasure , she has ever been my guide and helper in the hour of need . So , doubtless , it was meant ; and so it has been from that hour when we stood together beside the broken tomb giving thanks to Apollo . I gazed toward Delphi , down the road along which we had trailed our chains , now obscure in the twilight . But she  | " No , Cylon , not there ; that way lies worse than death , and the curse of Apollo is upon all that place . " With light touch she led me along the ascending path into the gloom of the gorge ; here she studied the marks of the rock and presently checked me under a jutting cliff , its summit lost in the night . She pointed up . " If we were winged birds ? " I began . " No : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have climbed it , when I was not yet a priestess , but a little girl , running wild in these places . There is here a way . Cylon , there is no other . " She went before , clinging by jut and crevice ; I followed with clutching fingers and groping toes , my eyes strained upward , for I knew that by one step not in the print of hers I might hang in mid air from a ladderless rock . So the gulf grew behind us , not seen but felt . At last , at the giddiest height , the reach of the cliff next above us bellied out like a sail ; and here we clung on a little ledge of the precipice , with scant foothold , our fingers knotted in a crack in the face of the stone . " Cylon " ? her voice chimed with the moan of the wind , yet breathed its sigh in words . " Cylon , from this shelf of rock there is no way but one , a desperate way , which you alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near and the god will give you aid . Behind you , within a fathom  --  turn your head a little , do you catch its glimmer ? ? a great vine hangs down , well rooted above . And now  --  there is no way else ? you must loose your hold from the cliff and face outward , and as your body sways to fall leap and clutch the vine ; the god will surely put it in your hand . By this you may climb to the top , and there , coiled on a stump , you will find a rope which the shepherds sometimes use ; and with that you may  | save me too if you will , for the way of the vine is beyond my strength . But not to dare is death to both . " Now of all the terrors that have shaken my body and daunted my soul , I deem this the worst . But the place gave no choice ; unless I would fall in this hope , what remained but to fall without it  --  and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my fingers from the crevice , I turned and swayed out from the cliff , sweeping with my arm through the gloom  --  and by Apollo 's grace my hand met the vine . By this I climbed up , and though the roots crackled with my weight , surmounted the top , where I found the rope and knotting a loop drew up the maid . Glad was I when she stood beside me . Here I thought to rest , leaning upon my elbow close by the brink , much spent , but well pleased to be once more borne up on a place that was flat . But she called " Cylon , rise quickly ! There is yet another peril , and yours again is the task , though more , I think , to your liking . " Even as she spoke the bushes rustled and an armed man loomed before us . I awaited no aim of his pike , but braving its thrust in the shadows ran in to close grapple , and while he was still encumbered with his weapon I had him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we strained and tugged by the perilous verge till , at sudden advantage , I flung him backward over my head with the desperate surge of last effort ; and behind was the precipice . I heard a trailing cry , a thump as of a fallen clod  --  and no more . Then I sank to the ground , utterly spent . And now I found some respite , brief but sweet . For Doria came and sat beside me and lifted my head to her lap , while my lungs heaved like sea-waves after storm and my limbs quivered to rest like a shot bow . I had no words , for my By the Will of Apollo 87  | throat was scorched with hot breathing and the blood-rush of battle still fogged my heart . But after a little , " Look , ( : ylon , " she said ; and I sat upright . We looked down from the brink beside us on a tumult of torches far below ; a trumpet rang up to our ears , and a flutter of voices came and went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broken , Cylon , and soon they will find  --  him that fell . Then the tyrant will know . He will rage ; they will scour the hills . We must flee with all speed . " " At least , " I said , " I have this , and in it is comfort . " I raised the fallen pike . And she : " It is heavy and of little use . But come . " She caught my hand ; we fled long , with unrelaxing haste . We looked hack from a higher slope and saw torches dancing where we had stood . And still we fled , through shadowy glens , dark groves of pine , over ridges , up shaly steeps where our footsteps clamored , ever upward . I mounted a ledge with my spear and drew up Doria by the shaft . " Indeed , " she cried , " it has a use ; and this is far better , I think , than slaying with it . " But we paused not yet , though weary and faint ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grew thin with the height ; the grey of the morning dimmed the stars ; soon dawn began to flush on the sky . Then we halted ; we stood on the topmost peak of Parnassus . " He never will seek us here , " she panted . " He himself could never climb so high , nor without him will any other . He can lead no army here , and without an army he dare not leave his den ; we shall see him no more . " " I have a better hope , " I said . " May Apollo grant me this , that I meet him once again on a fair field of battle , spear in hand . " For my heart grew grim at thought of my comrades .  | " Then , " said she , " we must turn to the north ; it is Philip he fears , not Thebes . But , Cylon , let us leave him to the god . Why speak of the tyrant now ? In this hour can you not forget your spear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joy shone from her eyes , but she was weak with the toil of the way . I laid down my pike ; and as we sat in the rosy bloom that fell from heaven , her head was on my shoulder , her soft hand lost in mine , with none to threaten or scoff . " Cylon , " she whispered , " is not this the sweetest morning , since first the rosy-fingered dawn mounted into the sky ? At last the god has set me free . I am only Doria now , and speak no more from a tripod nor fear the shadow from the misting chasm . My soul is quite my own ; unless , indeed , by woman 's choice , I should yield it up to another  --  and he would be no god , Cylon . But that is a very different matter ; for so , I should speak with my own tongue still . " She shivered a little in the freshening wind , and I wrapped my arms about her . " Doria , " I cried , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that strange vision by the way , before ever I had heard your voice , I said in my heart : Where this shall lead I will follow , even to the gates of death . ' And so it shall be . " But she whispered : " Not so : henceforth it is for me to follow , for I am but a woman now , and no Pythia , to cry out dire words for Apollo . And I will follow you , Cylon , even to the end of the way , for I am yours altogether . And I think it was always so , since first I saw you by the altar , when you were a little boy with a greater interest in goats . " " Who , of us two , shall lead , " I answered , " and which shall seem to follow , matters little and has no meaning while we  | walk together . " And I kissed her lips , but still with awe , for scarcely yet could I feel that she was but a woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close under the edge of the sky . We sat in shadow , but the distant sea , fretted with islands , flashed up in sudden light , then wavered , dim in mist . Nearer , Olympus towered in gloom , the hugest billow of a sea of mountains , crested with a foam of cloud ; and this too began to sparkle under the lifting glance of Apollo . ' hen , as he searched the plain , each bay and lake and river and all the bending coast shone out , and Hellas lay unrolled beneath us like a written scroll , that our eyes might choose . " To the north , " she said , " for from the north comes vengeance . So spoke the god . Cylon , if still you must wield a spear , let it serve the will of the god . "  | In which is related how we descended Parnassus and what we found below , and how a dispute arose . That Parnassus ' top is earth 's true summit and rises nearest that etherial city which Zeus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe ; and so she held who was wiser than I in such matters as this . And if any , reciting the words of Homer , shall claim that Olympus lifts its stairway yet nearer , and is indeed the very gate , not even so shall I concede it , though I revere the poet . For Homer spoke as one prompted by the Muses and on their aid he depended , but Doria spoke the word of Apollo ; and who would trust the Muses before Apollo ? Many a mountain , she said , not one alone , has been called Olympus through the error of men ; but among the gods this is the name of their dwelling place , high above all mountains , and its nearest portal is Parnassus . So spoke Doria , and so it was taught in Apollo 's temple , and to this opinion I hold . Now on such a threshold of the sky the air is sweet in the nostrils , like the odor of nectar , and full of ecstasy as blowing down from the aisles of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too thin and keen for mortals to breathe it long . And we , I and my Doria , each in the other blessed by Apollo 's grace , were still but mortal  --  though the god poured over us By the Will of Apollo 91  | such a libation of rosy light that Doria blushed like the dawn , and I in the valor of my love would have grappled with a Minotaur . But not even she , and I much less , might linger here , for this wine of the gods exalts the spirit but leaves the body faint . Even the goats of Pan , that sport upon the peaks , find pasturage at lower levels , and the bread of men lay far below , still to be sought , as of old , amid toils and perils . Meanwhile the sun had climbed some space into the sky and shone with a whiter glow . Observing this I started up as at a sudden call ; but as I stooped for the spear , " Do you not perceive , " said she , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plucked thence by impious hands ? " Then I noted that its head was broad and flat , of an antique pattern , such as a potter might figure on a vase ; and with many such , plundered from ancient offerings , Onomarchus had armed his men . " Let us bear away no spoils of the god , " she cried . " Will you not rather set it up as a trophy in this holy place ? " Now this was hard , to go spearless through the hills , but harder to refuse when Doria thus besought me . So , wresting the blade from the wood , I made it fast in my girdle . " This , " I said , " I will borrow from the god , lest I be found weaponless in his service , for I have no knife . Only the shaft will I consecrate . " And she : " It shall suffice . " Whereupon I set the tall shaft upright in a cleft of the rock and heaped loose stones about it , and so left it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may still be standing , bleached and warped by many winters ; for few visit that spot , and unless lured by spoils of metal who would cast down a trophy ? Then from this stepping-stone of the gods we began to descend to the dusty fields of men  --  racing hand in hand ,  | like children at a festival , when the slope was smooth , but where ledges broke our path I went before and from below received her in my arms . Loath was Ito unclasp them , eager to bear her away like booty from the field of battle ; and thus was I reconciled to the loss of my spear . We entered a region of looming clouds , not above but all around us  --  vast thronging shapes that rushed in upon us like a herd of dragons out of the middle air , casting windswift shadows far below . Shedding gloom they came , but as they billowed over us vanished , and we stood enclosed as in a pavilion of shining mist , drenched with unhelpful light . For it stopped the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three paces the slope before us seemed ever to fall away like the brink of a precipice , and we walked in fear with halting feet , but advancing found the foothold firm and the threatening verge still beyond our step . Then Doria laughed , and said she : " So seems the life of men , Cylon , and such in the sight of the gods are the dangers we have passed ; for fear in the soul is like the mist . Yet let us be wary , for there are real precipices upon this mountain , even upon Parnassus ; and may Apollo guide us through its fogs ! " As she spoke there came a rift in the smother of mist , and we saw before us a precipice in very truth , its shelving edge so near that we checked and drew back with a surge of the heart  --  while a glimpse of the shadowy gorge beneath and the wide valley beyond flashed up and for an instant filled our eyes , then was lost as the glimmering cloud closed about us . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with bated breath . " He has made of my idly spoken words a quickanswered prayer . " By the Will of Apollo 93  | A long circuit we made , but at last descended safely . And now we stood beneath the clouds after the manner of men , and gazing upward saw behind us a mighty cliff , over the brow of which the flowing mist poured like a torrent but fell not . Here gentler slopes began , fretted with many paths beaten by the hoofs of goats , and below , not far , lay a forest dark with pines , where shelter might be had . Well it was that we had reached this place , for Doria 's strength was spent . She swayed as one who has a mortal wound and clutched my arm with sliding fingers . " Cylon , 0 Cylon , I can go no further , " she breathed in my ear , and like the fall of some soft garment sank beside me . Then , as I bent above her , " You were best to leave me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you too perish in this endless desert . For here ? 0 Cylon  --  I think my journey ends . " " Leave you ! " ? but on that I wasted no more words . Into my arms I gathered her and struggled on , and she , when she had striven a little , lay still upon my breast . Such joy as this I had never known in camp or city ; it was wine to my heart . Thus , though I too was far spent , the rough way grew short and easy  --  so quickly passed that I almost grieved as we entered the fringe of the wood and I laid her down on the drifted pine leaves . A fair camping ground I thought it , yet it seemed to Doria wild and strange . She lay faint and bewildered , gazing at the waving boughs , listening with dread to the rustle of scurrying feet under the trees . " Is there no cottage near , " she asked , " for better shelter , and food perhaps ? " I heaped a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ range so high , " I said . " But here is rest , and food I will shortly bring . " " Food ? " said she . " Indeed I am famished , Cylon ; for  | though in the temple we fasted at fit seasons , we climbed no mountains . But if there is food there will surely be a cottage , and if you find it bring me there ; for the storms are cold and terrible upon these hills , and under a roof of leaves , if Zeus sends rain ? " " There will be no rain , " I told her , " and I am now the better prophet . " She smiled upon me and would have laughed , but could only breathe a sigh . " I would gladly grant you that . To me it has been an evil gift , to speak in fear and anguish ill words which none believe , like that Cassandra . I will not doubt you , Cylon , when you seek to comfort me . And yet ? " She did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lips , but closed her eyes and lay so still that I seemed alone . By morning I would be alone indeed , unless Already the sun was low and the air chill . I found dry stalks of fennel , drew the pith , and upon it with clashing stones struck sparks . Soon , fanned with breath , a glow appeared , which , fed with twigs and fallen branches , leaped up with so loud a crackle that Doria roused . " It is good , " she murmured , and turned a little to catch the warmth ; " but how in such a wilderness have you found fire ? " And when I had told her , " What need , " she cried , " for Prometheus to bring down sparks from heaven and anger Zeus ? I think he was less clever than Cylon . " " And much less happy . " Whereat , and in the comfort of the fire , she glowed , but essayed to frown . " We boast and are presumptuous , " she said . " Yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spark you struck is from no tainted hearth , but the gift of earth and pure , and you have made the mountain of the god his altar . But  --  I do not mean to doubt you , Cylon , but have you any offering that we may taste ? "  | " Do not fear ; there shall be a victim . " Laying a circle of stones about the fire I walled it in like a burning city , then hastened out into the dusk where the mountain hares were running . Two I struck down with hand-stones , and these with the whetted bronze of the spear-head I flayed and divided . This done , I trimmed a staff and fixed the blade upon it  --  no ill spit , and a weapon too at need . She clapped her hands , though but weakly . " Again I will say it , " she cried , " Prometheus was not so full of devices . But will you give no part to the god ? " So , with a clumsy prayer , at which she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I burned some bits to the god . The rest , with better skill , I roasted over the coals . " How sweet it is , " said she , " and flavored with the very balsam of the pine ! In the temple no such meat as this was served . " Yet she ate but daintily , less than her portion , but drank deeply of the water I brought in a cup of bark . " Such is the wine of the mountain , " I told her , " and it flows from a wine-press of rock . No other wine is here . " " For thirst it is better than wine , " she declared . " It is the gift of Zeus from the clouds of heaven , while wine is but the gift of Dionysus , trodden from presses in the vineyards of men " ? which to me was a new thought , for I had esteemed wine the greater gift . Thick darkness was about us now , and we sat , as it were , in a tent with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire , beyond which phantom barrier all the hidden thickets seemed full of prowling footfalls . Doria shuddered , and her eyes roved . I settled the spear-head more firmly on its shaft . " Do you not see that I was right in demanding a weapon ? " I asked her .  | " I had no thought of beasts , " she said , " nor ever expected to sleep in their unfenced fold . " " The world is full of beasts , " I told her , " and of men even worse . While this is so , and I see no end of it , weapons are needful . But with me , fear nothing . Is this that Doria who defied the tyrant ? " " In the temple , " she answered , " I feared Apollo only , as was meet . But here the god seems far away and I no longer hear his voice ; and here I am like other women and fear all things  --  even Cylon , whom I most trust . " Yet soon , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pine-drift , and the god whose care she had for a moment doubted sent her , unasked , the boon of sleep . All night I stood watching beside her , feeding the fire and holding ready my makeshift pike ; for restless steps still circled round us , drawn by the odor of meat , and many times I caught the gleam of eyes . Once a hear pressed closer , pushing his black snout into the circle of light , but when I had hurled at him a faggot , drew back , and I heard his whine as he padded away . He at least would not return , for these brutes are shrewd and have no relish for a mauling . Then , as the gloom grew lucent and dim avenues began to open through the trees , I sat bowed by the embers , propped with my spear-shaft , and while I nursed I too became lost in sleep . I was waked by a soft touch on my brow and in sudden alarm leaped up to swing my pike ; but Doria stood before me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun had risen out of night , with shreds of darkness still clinging upon it , so shone her face amid her loosened tresses . " Would you slay me , Cylon ? " she cried . " I knew well that the weapon was not my friend . "  | I placed it in her hand . " It is blameless , " I told her , " and at need a faithful helper . But I have betrayed my watch , and you may justly smite me with it . " She flung it down and wrapped her arms about my neck . " I am ungrateful , Cylon , and more jealous than Hera , for not even she would deny Zeus his thunderbolt against the ' titans . Take up the spear ; in your hands I shall learn to love Cylon . It has guarded me all this night , while the forest swarmed with monstrous things  --  chimaeras , I think , for they say that this mountain is haunted with them  --  and I was terrified . Indeed , Cylon , you need not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ places like this , where the light is dine ; so I have been taught by the wisest of the women . " I laughed as I stooped for my pike . " Such beasts , " I said , " I have met many times and in the dusk have on occasion slain them , yet in the morning found no carcass . Such a thing is a chimaera : when it is slain it is gone altogether , for n its substance is the breath of men . " " II may be so , " she answered , " and I will not dispute with u , Cylon . But to me they were terrible in the darkness , Ifd such another night I could not hear . Let us hasten down regions where men dwell in houses , such as beasts can not ter . " And there , " I warned her , " we may find worse than chimaeras ; yet with this , " and I shook the pike , " though its balance is much at fault , I fear not even the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little use in Delphi , " said she , " but that ' I fear not ' served you well ; for danger is often such a And I , in later days , remembering these words of Doria , blustering thing as you deem the chimaera , and vanishes before him who has no fear . " 98 By the Will of Apollo  | have wondered less than others at that unfailing luck of Alexander , who ventured all hazards and knew no fear . We descended slowly , skirting the lower steeps , for I would take no chances where horse might come . After a time Doria 's morning strength began to wane , but at noon we came to a spot where wild grapes grew , which gave both food and drink in their rich clusters ; and here , under the drooping vines , we lingered through the midday heat , for the way beyond was more open . Yet when we arose Doria 's step still was languid and her face like that of one who , after respite , is again laid on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Cylon ? I did not know that the world was such a wilderness , so vast and so empty . Not so did Apollo reveal it to me , but full of walled cities and furrowed fields , with roads between , on which I saw wagons and creeping carts , and even chariots . " " You have seen it only in visions , " I told her , " and beheld it like the god , without measure of time or space , which to him are as nothing . But look ! This grass has been freshly cropped by sheep , and toward the west I see a trace of smoke against the sky . " " I can not perceive it , " said she , " but am fain enough to believe . May Apollo bring us this night to a roof , at least of thatch , with better shelter than waving boughs ! " " You need not scruple to trust the god , " I said ; " and even to me you might trust a little in a matter like this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darkness , Cylon , when I heard those prowling creatures and all the doors of the wood stood open to them , I trusted you above Apollo . And if this was a sin the god shall forgive me , for he gave me into your hand and even by the tyrant 's voice made you mine . " uj  | Thence we went on with lightened hearts and a better pace , descending a deep ravine ; but as we climbed its further slope we heard a wailing cry , faint on the wind . I liked it little . She stood with every muscle tense . " Cylon , it is a baby , " she said , " a little baby , lost in the wood , crying for hunger . " " Do not be deluded . Fauns haunt these places , and spirits of the wood not good to meet ; but a babe ? " " It is a baby , " she cried . " Would I not know ? Let us run to it . " More likely it is a mountain cat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has , like the moan of a man when he lies stricken . " " Shall I go alone ? " said she . " It is a baby , and I will find it . " To that I made no answer , but in some wrath strode behind as she wove through the thickets . And in a glade we found it , a babe indeed , swathed in linen bands , lying like a slug among the rocks , gasping with its cries . She caught it up , and when it lay upon her bosom the weeping ceased . Now this to me was mere womanish softness and excess of folly . For we ourselves were hunted fugitives , unprovided with anything , bound for an alien camp ; how , then , should we care for a babe ? To expose an infant thus seemed a cruel act , but if the parents were so hard of heart as not to wish to rear their own , it was no concern of ours ; so I bade her lay it down , since it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bade me lay it down , " said she , " I would not . " For she was ever rash in pity . " You are already weak and faint , " I urged her . " Such a burden you can not and you shall not bear . " " When I find that I can not , then I will lay him down . I will not leave him here to perish ; those beasts would come at his  | cry and tear him with their teeth . It is a boy , I think , and see how beautiful he is . Oh , Cylon ! if he were yours would you leave him to die ? " " If it were mine , " I said , " I would guard it with my life , nor even ask if it were boy or girl . But this is none of mine . As for the face it may be fair enough , but I loathe it like a venomous worm . " Now whether I was right in my misliking , time was to show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will . " He shall be saved for some great deed , " she said . " This is mountain madness , " I cried . " You shall leave it as we found it . " But now I spoke with no assurance . She sat upon a rock and pressed the infant close ; it blinked and seemed to sleep . " Go on , " she said , " if you will leave us , Cylon . Here I will sit and give him comfort while I may  --  till those creatures come . " What use to reason with a woman ? By the strength of her weakness she will ever have her way . " Give me the babe , " I said , " and follow . Some shelter I will find and what is needful I will take , whether by force or entreaty . " She looked up , searching my soul , then smiled and laid the irksome burden in my arm . It awoke and clamored , but she walked beside me and soothed it with hand and voice . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disputing in our hearts .  | The filmy streak of smoke that was my beacon rose nearer than I had expected . As we mounted the crown of the ridge we heard the barking of a dog , and ere long saw a shepherd 's hut , half hidden under a ledge and with a fold beyond . As we approached , the door swung out and a man appeared , wrapped in a goat-skin , clutching a spear . I dropped the swaddled babe into Doria 's arms and bade her keep behind ; for the dog , urged on by his master 's chirking , was bounding toward us with wolfish yelps , which a well-cast billet presently turned to howling and flight . The man halted , close by the door . He was short but sturdy , thick bearded , with a dull scowl and a furtive eye . " Who are you ? " he called roughly . " And how did you come by the brat , which is none of yours ? " " We come as supplicants , " I told him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night . And a babe on a mountain side is the prize of the finder , be it man or beast . But if you choose to claim such a package of trouble , the only ransom we ask is shelter . " " And a pledge , " cried Doria , " a promise confirmed with an oath . And unless the mother ? " 101  | " She is dead , " he answered shortly . " But since the woman , whatever she was , died in my cabin , the child is mine to deal with . " His voice had fallen somewhat ; he glanced back at the door . " Yet I do not care to claim it ; keep it , and begone . " I was not so easily put off . " Tomorrow , after food and rest . Man , tonight you shall receive us , as the gods command . " " Not for Zeus  --  no , nor Apollo . " He fumbled his spear , but seeing me not unarmed spoke craftily . " For your own good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are lepers , both my wife and I , and for that reason we dwell apart . " I laughed in his face . " Not lepers , but liars ; but I , like one recovered from the plague , have no fear of such infection . " " You will rue it , " he growled . " Even thieves  --  and I think you no better  --  avoid this place . " But he said no more of this ; for a woman looked out of ' the doorway , and seeing the babe , ran toward us with extended arms . " The gods have sent him back to us , Coptas  --  back from Apollo 's mount , by the hand of strangers . It is Apollo 's will that he shall live . " Her voice was shrill , shaken with hope and dread . " You shall not again deny him to me , Coptas . " " Be still , " he said . " The god has given the babe to these , and I have confirmed it . Submit , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no more outcry . It is no child of yours , Mataea . " " Two of my own , " she wailed , " you have taken from me , and would not rear them because I had borne you girls . But this boy I will have . " She knelt at Doria 's feet with upturned palms . " Give him to me , " she cried . " Woman , you shall give him to me . " And Doria laid the whimpering roll in her arms , whereat I breathed thanks to Apollo . But Coptas was furious .  | " What a thing have you done ! " He cursed until I poised my spear . " She shall not have it . Why should I rear a brat not mine , born of some outcast , a trull of the camps ? " " For many better and holier reasons , " answered Doria ? and her voice rang out as at Delphi ? " but also because the woman , she that is dead , gave you gold on this promise . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No gold . Some scraps of brass , and a bit of silver , it may be , but no gold . How should such as she have gold ? " " Do you not know , " said Doria , " that Apollo hears you , and that his eye has seen all ? " " Not in the hut , " he cried , " not through the thatch ? " but suddenly was silent . Then , " What manner of woman is this , that speaks for Apollo ? " " It is the Pythia , " I told him ? " she who spoke Apollo 's word from the tripod and vexed the tyrant 's heart . " Ile quailed . " I have heard great rumor of it , " said he , " in the village below . " His voice was hushed , but again grew loud . " What you say can not be ; for the Pythia died by the tyrant 's command . At least , the tomb holds her . " " Even from the tomb Apollo led her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not heard of that also ? Was not the earth shaken by it , even here ? And I am he who was entombed to perish with her , if you have heard the tale . " And now he fell on his knees before her , trembling , moist with the sweat of fear . " Woman or ghost , " he said , " I beseech your pardon , for how could I know that I spoke to the Very Pythia ? But turn from me Apollo 's anger and I will do Vout bidding , and my house is yours while you will . " And she , still speaking in Delphic tones : " The wrath of the god is not averted by promises uttered in terror and soots lot got ten ; yet he is not implacable . Keep faith and he  | shall spare you ; but if you are false to your promise and harm this child , no forest , no cavern , shall hide you from his vengeance . " He swore by the tripod of Delphi , bowing his face to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door , hung an olive branch from the rough lintel . " For the babe , " she cried , weeping with joy , " is born again to life , and thus I will announce it to gods and men . " Now might Doria rest beneath a roof and taste of the bread she had longed for  --  coarse barley cakes with the dust of ash upon them , but to us sweet on the tongue . And with these they set before her an offering of lamb 's flesh , humbly , like those who lay gifts before a goddess , and in place of wine brought milk . Of what they had , nothing was stinted . But when we had eaten  --  I with the greed of Hercules , while she barely nibbled the bread and scarcely touched the meat  --  the woman placed the child in Doria 's lap . " It shall be his tenth-day feast , " she said , " and you who have saved him shall give him a name . " But Doria turned to me . " It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name . " My pleasure at this was less than none . The little beast was odious to me , even then  --  the lips too full , the chin too weak , the eyes catlike . But since Doria asked it , " Let him be called Pausanias , " I said , " as having abated sorrow . " " He is rightly named , " exclaimed the women , both together . But the man began to grumble , saying , " not so , he will bring much mischief . My way was the better . Yet it is idle to oppose Apollo 's will . " And whether these words were truly ominous or had no deeper meaning than he meant , I will not assume to say ; but the gods will sometimes speak portentous words by the tongues of the witless . By the Will of Apollo 105  | Now this I have noted , that plans are needful yet nothing falls out as it is planned . I had thought to depart quickly and proceed into Thessaly , seeking Philip . But in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which in the end was our salvation , for the tyrant 's spies were in every village . Yet this protecting hindrance came as a deadly menace , for thus it befell . That night the cabin was left to the women , Coptas withdrawing to the fold and I keeping guard outside the house , for so I chose to arrange it . But again weariness overcame me ; and while I lay stretched on the threshold in such sleep that if a robber had used my body as a stepping-stone I doubt I would have wakened , a worse thing entered in against which my spear was weaker than a woman 's spindle . For when at last , with the morning sun hot on my face , I aroused and pulled open the cabin door , Mataea checked me with lifted hand . And there I saw Doria , not yet risen , sunk on a pile of fleeces . At the noise she started up with a little cry but met me with strange eyes , and on her cheeks instead of blushes the hot glow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but again she strove to rise , gazing about her as if she saw some grisly vision where nothing was . ' hen sinking back she murmured words , I know not what , in a restless stream ; Delphic , they seemed , and dire , but I could trace no meaning in them . Long days and never-ending nights I watched beside her with Mataea . In my heart I sometimes cursed and sometimes prayed , but saw little change . Coptas , with sullen deference , brought food to the door but slept in the fold , and the woman served us like a slave . When the babe grew Fretful , " Be still , " she whispered in his ear ; " it is Doria , of Apollo 's temple , who saved you from death . Will you ever be  | peevish thus ? " And she smothered his cries in her bosom . At last , when the fires on Doria 's cheeks had wasted to pale ashes , her eyes , that so long had wavered like the fitful glimmer from troubled waters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radiance of stars . She smiled upon me and sought to lay her hand in mine , but could not , nor speak my name , for her voice faded on her lips . Not yet could we leave our place of refuge . Now to Doria , because of his awe of the god , Coptas remained obsequious , but to me he grew surly . " I can not feed a sturdy thief forever , " he said , and as we talked he began to bluster and waved his boar-spear . " Cast it , if so you are minded , " I bade him , standing back a little ; and he , being angry and seeing me defenseless  --  for I had left my clumsy spear in the hut  --  accepted my challenge and cast at me with all his strength . I swerved a handbreadth , and the plunging ash quivered in the ground behind me ; I plucked it up and leaned upon it . " It is now my turn , " I told him , " but if once I cast you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herd frogs in the marshes while your flocks in the fold will be mine for the taking . But perhaps you will think it better to be civil to one who asks little yet might take all . " His jaw had fallen . " I yield , " he said . " It is better to feed a thief than be eaten by him . " For still he muttered of thieves , being a coward of no discretion , ever needing the spur of present terror . It was plain that there could be no dependence upon him unless he were more abjectly cowed . So , at a venture " Have you heard of one Lachas ? " I asked him . " Lachas ! Why speak of Lachas ? " I saw that my random shaft had touched a vital spot . His voice faltered , and he paid to this name such homage of unfeigned fear as he had  | not shown to the weapon which he deemed I would not cast . " Why speak of that Lachas , who haunts all the mountains of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thickets , " or speak of other things . " To this I gave no heed . " He too has been called a thief . " " Not by me , " he muttered hastily , " yet such words may have been spoken . They say he is a monster like the Cyclops , dwelling alone in a cavern full of plunder , devouring men and roasting their livers on a three-tined fork such as fishers use . But I say nothing . Why speak of Lachas ? " " You do well to curb your tongue , " I told him , " but you are late to perceive it . " He glanced at me shrewdly . " Do you mean ? " he began , hut went on with returning insolence . " No , you are not he . Fool , did you think to gull me ? For Lachas is above five obits , and his voice like the howl of the wind ; he offers dogs for a sacrifice , and no man has seen him sober . And he spares none @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That is true , " I said , " but you are rash no less ; for I.achas ? " I paused and laid the weight of my eyes upon him ? " Lachas spares whom I bid him spare and none else . l , achas knows his master . " His knees shook ; his insolence ran from him like a splash of ' water off a goatskin . " Are you that Hermidion , " he cried , Of whom they tell , who never is seen , but directs all , and whether he be god or man , none knows ? " I let him feel my frown . " By that name I have been called , and to me Lachas is but a servant . What , then , are you ? " He groveled at my feet . " Your slave , " he answered , " and t he least of them all . Speak no ill of me to Lachas . Let it be remembered for me that I have served you well up to this day  --  which is empty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and hereafter you shall find no blame in Coptas . I  | might have known that you were not as others when , standing so close , I could not strike you with my spear ; and before , when you led the very Pythia to my hut , I might have known . But my heart was dull . " From that day forth he held me in reverence even above the daughter of the temple , and my word was law ; for whom he feared he served , and when his fear was great enough he might be trusted . Many such I have known . And now Doria , though still as white as a willow wand and as frail , was slowly gaining strength . Already she could walk alone , though Mataea restrained her like a mother and to serve her would even let the petulent babe scream . So I felt that I might leave her , in this safe retreat , for a hasty visit to Athens , as the occasion seemed urgent . For soon I should have need of money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been well stripped . Yet for Doria , when we resumed our journey northward , a donkey must be had , and some store of silver to spend on the way , since not in all places may what is needful be taken with a flourish of the spear . I had not been wholly improvident in this matter . While still in the service of Thebes , trusting none in that city , I had sent to Athens some parcels of coin for deposit with Phormion the banker , who had taken over the business of Pasion , once his master , and was accounted honest . For indeed , those who deal with most money can least afford to be knavish ; to be honest brings far greater profit . Yet a messenger he might put off with excuses , the more as I could send no sure token ; and where should I find a trusty messenger ? Hence , for Doria 's sake , I must leave her this short space ; and to this she assented , though her fingers clung in mine as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the open country ill clad and unpro vided , scorned as a beggar and suspected as a thief , is no happy adventure ; yet to me no harm came of it . Some trouble I had in the villages because of that Delphian spear , which with its leaf-shaped bronze seemed to mark me as a brigand or a deserter . I should have exchanged weapons with Coptas , and this neglect cost many lies ; but being alone , girt with a sheepskin and smirched with abundant filth , I won through to the borders of Boeotia , where the tyrant was not to be feared . Yet the way beyond still was hard and full of vexations for lack of silver , which was not to be had unless by robbery  --  though plain food was given by country people to an armed man at the asking , with a scowl or a jest . But when at last , from the low Aegalian ridge by Eleusis , I saw Athena 's templed hill rising within the wide encircling walls like the boss of a mighty shield , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lane of battlements stretching down to the sea , where stood a second Athens scarcely less than in the first , its harbors thronged with ships from every port ? then sudden anger foamed in my heart . Here were my enemies sheltered , they who had wronged my father , 109  | robbed me , cast me out to sort with bandits and dwell in camps , a man without a city , when such a city as this was mine by inheritance . Again I felt myself a helpless child , fatherless , beaten at school , starved by my uncle ; like an evil dream these memories lay upon me . Scarcely with thoughts of Doria could I shake them off and command my spirit . What to me was Athens ? That night I slept outside the gates , but at sunrise entered , passing amid strange faces through familiar streets . I was in evil case , more like a Thracian savage than an Athenian ; but when I questioned the hurrying artisans , the clear Attic that fell from my tongue brought civil answers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Little enough I had heard it of late . From these I learned that the house of Phormion was in Piraeus , and down to the port I strode while the turrets along the way still slanted their morning shadows across my path ; the markets were not yet full when I reached his door . At first the porter , a burly Libyan with a spiked staff , barred the way , demanding my business ; but when I answered loudly that I brought a message from the ships , a voice from within bade him let me pass . " Now you go in , " said the slave , " and tell message quickly , but this , " plucking away my spear , " you leave by me . Such weapon ! Must have take it from Scyth . " I entered a great room , rich with rugs and costly furnishings . Here Phormion sat in a gilded chair , intent on a tablet from which a seal was hanging , but at my step started up in awkward haste like a servant at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ habit of servility . His face was kindly , broad and coarse , with eyes wont to tell no secrets , yet for an instant they flashed alarm as they rested upon me . He stopped short .  | " Man , you are not from the sea ; you bring no message of ships . What message , then ? " " None , " I told him , " but of my own need . " My voice appeared to reassure him . He answered with no discourtesy , but coldly . " If you seek a loan , money at this time is not easy to find . And since I am much occupied ? " " Listen , " I said . " I am that Cylon from whom you have received sundry remittances from Thebes . We have an account . I ask only for what is mine , and of that no large portion at present . " " It may be so . " He regarded me with more attention . " I perceive that you are better than you seem  --  Athenian born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man of decent breeding . But your face I do not know and you offer no tokens . If you are indeed that Cylon  --  and observe that I do not deny it  --  you can doubtless present some person of credit to vouch for you . " " I have been absent for many years . My uncle , I presume , is dead . " " If you speak of Pheidon , the brother of Hermogenes , it is scarcely two months since he had me before the Archon demanding an account of those very deposits you claim , alleging that Cylon had fallen in a raid at Delphi ; but he could produce no evidence . And now , within the month , he himself is dead  --  which to you , as a nephew , might be a matter of some concern , since he has left property open to litigation . But here is no proof that you are Cylon . " I reflected . " I once knew  --  but he was no friend of mine  --  a schoolmaster 's son . Aeschines , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That Aeschines ! I would not accept his word for a debt of three obols . A rascally pettifogger , no better than a sycophant . He conspired with your uncle to prove you dead 112 By the Will of Apollo  | and lay claim to your money ; you will get no help there . Surely , Cylon , you have some better acquaintance than these . " " I had also a schoolmate , and a good friend he was , but I do not even know whether he still lives , for he was sickly : a boy named Demosthenes , of the Paeanian quarter , who perhaps ? " " Demosthenes ! " he broke in . " If that young man knows you , all is well . I would trust him in a matter of twenty talents , or twice that . A rising man ; no better pleader is in Athens . He has lately won a case for me , Cylon , against a sycophant worse than Aeschines , the son of my  --  of him who was once my master . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a spendthrift , ever seeking to bleed me . I had a good case , Cylon ; yet by the unskill of advocates , or by fraud , I have sometimes lost cases as good . But when this young man had finished his presentation , the truth was made so clear that the jury would listen to no evasions . False witness was wasted upon them ; not one vote was cast against me . A masterly pleader is your old schoolmate , Cylon , and already he speaks from the bema as well . Seek him out , and his word shall suffice . " " Shall I go before him in this goatskin ? " I asked . " Not so ; not so . His nose is dainty , and so foul an odor might overpower recollection . This much silver I will venture upon you . " And from a chest in a closet he brought ten drachmas , which he counted out into my hand . " Now seek your friend  --  but first a bath and a decent garment . And let that goatskin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advance the silver . Is it your purpose , Cylon , to remain in Athens ? " " Not I ; the city that banished my father is no city of mine . " By the Will of Apollo 113  | " You were not , I think , included in his banishment , and the city is good to dwell in , law-abiding and hospitable beyond all others . Yet perhaps you are right ; it is of late much impoverished , and better pay may be had abroad . If you do not care whom you serve , I would commend you to Philip ; he digs from the mines of Pangaeus the price of Delphi year by year , and his hand is lavish . At Delphi not much is left . Why tempt the wrath of the god when more may be had in his service ? " " I shall not offend the god . " But this talk of Philip I turned aside , not wishing to disclose my plans , and soon departed . My spear I did not reclaim , leaving it with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be unlucky and Doria right in her thought that it should have remained on Parnassus . Yet  --  although it is true that this Phormion , in whose house I left it , not long after broke with Demosthenes and thenceforth was less lucky  --  I deem it mere folly to speculate on these matters . But that night , bathed and well scrubbed with Cimolian earth , I slept in clean lodgings on a bed that was bugless , for at Athens such a luxury may at least be bought ; and at dawn , rising unwillingly from this unwonted comfort , I put on the decent dress of a citizen and proceeded to the house of Demosthenes . The room into which I was ushered appeared small and plain ; no gilded seats or gaudy rugs were here , yet I perceived that nothing needful was stinted . It was vacant when I entered , but while I looked about me a step sounded in the corridor and my schoolmate stood before me . Little changed he seemed  --  I would have known him in Canopus  --  though already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with sterner lines than I remembered .  | " Well ? " he said , as I rose but waited in silence . " You have some business , doubtless , and my leisure is brief . " " Demosthenarion " ? by this schoolboy name I addressed him ? " have you forgotten the street of the Scythian Archer ? and one to whom in unhappy days you showed kindness ? ? which I , at least , do not forget . " His eyes met mine ; his cold look broke in recognition . " It is the son of Hermogenes , " he cried , " unless I dream and see his shade ; that Cylon who thrashed the master 's son and fled , we knew not where . We feared you had killed him , Cylon  --  which would have been a misfortune , both to you and others ; for he has since been of some service to the state , though I do not wholly trust him . " lie grasped my hand . " Indeed , we are friends from of old ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you some past kindness , it may chance that I shall now be able to render you more important service . It would be a pleasure to me , Cylon ; but at least we are friends . " He seemed deeply moved , and as he spoke the hard lines on his face relaxed almost to the look of ' boyish days . I perceived that his heart was lonely and he had much need of a friend ; he too had walked amid treacheries and found few to trust . " Demosthenes , " I said , " to others who have shown me favor , even the kindest , I would not wish to be further indebted but rather to repay them and have done . Yet with you I feel no such scruple and am glad to be in your debt , for kindness such as yours seems but a helping hand which gives ease and leaves no burden . " I paused . " Never before have I spoken words like these to any man , on long or short acquaintance ; and I wonder at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pledge of friendship , " he anBy the Will of Apollo 115  | swered , " to give without obligation and to accept as freely . But here we can not talk at ease . " For now there was much rapping at the door and many were entering . " Come with PI me , " he said . " These may wait . " He led me quickly through dusky passages , then down a ladder into a basement chamber , closing above us the heavy trap . The place was roomy and quiet , craftily lighted by an open shaft extending upward to the roof . Lamps too were here , with a faint odor of oil . Along the walls were chests of cedar filled with books , of which one lay outside , half unrolled , being that wherein the son of Olorus has recorded the words spoken by Pericles over those who had fallen in 11 defense of Athens . This , he told me , he had copied with his own hand , for he loved that book ; and on a shelf near-by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the end 111 farthest from the entrance , was set up a mirror of silver , the largest I had seen , lacking not much of two cubits , so that by standing back a little I beheld myself at full height . He blushed as he noted my surprise , and said : " This is no womanish vanity , Cylon . I have found it much the most honest of critics , and before it I am wont to declaim , watching every attitude and gesture with the eye of an enemy . For here is my gymnasium , in which with more unsparing toil than any wrestler I train for the public contest . And then , Cylon , when after endless labor and hard contending the prize is won , some jealous Pytheas chooses to taunt me that my speeches smell of the lamp  --  which indeed lights here no revels such as his . But all this matters little if the end is gained . " 11 " So I have often felt , " I told him , " after some arduous venture , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rash assay of Delphi through which I won my greatest prize , and 11  | the last this beggarly incursion upon Athens , at the end of which I have found a friend . " " There came a rumor that you had died in Delphi  --  unfounded , I hoped , and so find it . " " Not wholly false , " I assured him , " for there I was as good as dead , not lacking even burial ; but Apollo delivered me . " And I told him all the tale . " Cylon , " he cried , " it is astounding  --  a divine portent , if such a thing may be . It reproves our unbelief . It makes clear many things . Do you say that the god speaks no more at Delphi ? " " He is gone altogether . The tripod is a broken toy . If there is still any report of oracles , the tyrant speaks for Apollo . " " I shall remember it , Cylon . I have suspected this , and you have done me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In what way can I aid you ? " I told him my need . " That is easy , " he said , " and not to be counted . Phormion shall be satisfied ; the fellow is honest enough for his trade , though as exacting as a peddler of fishes . But I can serve you in more than this . Your uncle is lately dead , and much silver was found in his house . " " So I have learned . " " Since no heir appeared , false claims have been set up . If you bid me I will settle the matter for you to the best advantage . I know these rascals well , and their price ; and , Cylon , they know that I know them , and will be the less eager to meet me in court . " " I trust all to you . " " It will be wise to make some concessions . If the matter comes to public trial the graves of old scandals will surely he opened and the bones of the dead dragged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would sooner forfeit my claim . "  | " No need , for I will drive a thrifty bargain with the sycophants . But , Cylon , tell me this , and frankly : have you ever borne arms against the city ? " " Scarcely  --  yet once , in the service of Thebes , I was under arms at Oropus . " " At Oropus ! That spot is like an ulcer to the touch . We will call no jury , Cylon . And in Theban service ! What a weapon is this for a sycophant ! " " What is that to me ? The silver is mine by right , but let it go ; I shall have enough . And in Philip 's camp no sycophant can so much as graze my shield . " " You go to Philip ? ? to the foe of Athens ? " " To Philip I go , and why not ? He has proclaimed himself Apollo 's champion , while Athens screens the god 's enemy , and mine . With Philip I shall serve the god @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I will not defend Onomarchus . I admit him much in the wrong , a sacrilegious beast . But if ' , as already I apprehend , Philip presently strikes at our city " It is none of mine . " " Yet here you were born , and here ? " " For ten generations it has oppressed my line . Your courts are the plotting place of thieves , your Pnyx the stamping ground of bellowing cattle  --  which you may seek to herd if you will , but their horns will rip you at last . I hate these walls and all that they encompass , save only you . And for this , Demosthenes , you can not blame me . " So I , hot with passion , and stopped breathless . But he said gravely , " For this I do blame you , Cylon  --  except that I disbelieve your words altogether . Would you shed the blood of citizens ? " And at this I checked , though angry . " No blood of any citizen has stained my spear , nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though I will not slay my kindred  --  no , nor help to enslave them  --  with this forbearance my every debt is paid and what I owe to Athens is less than nothing .

Is it nothing that your tongue coins Attic as pure as mine ? You are proud of that  --  you can not deny it ; and of this , that your soul is the quick soul of an Athenian . Is here no debt ? " I stood silent . What could I say ? I was indeed an Athenian to the marrow ; I could be nothing else . If I would deny it , my Attic speech and Attic wit proclaimed the falsehood . I did not deny it ; I gloried in it  --  yet hated my native city . Shame struggled with anger . " I too have had wrongs , " he said , " but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . " I will be no traitor , even for injuries . For now I see that a man may not disown his birth . " " Not if he be an Athenian , and worthy of it . And Cylon , I think , will prove himself worthy of his heritage  --  his and mine  --  the greatest in Hellas . " " Demosthenes , " I promised him , " I will at least be no traitor ; and this I swear by the great god of Delphi , that in the hour of need I will fight for the city of my birth and by no means against her . Not again shall you call rue traitor . " " The time approaches , " he said , " when Athens will have need of all her sons  --  all who will serve her with loyal hearts , and not least such as you , strong with the spear . " " When that day comes , " I told him , " I will do my part , though my heart is sore . Indeed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But meanwhile I will not remain in this place , which to me is drenched with memories as bitter as hemlock , nor will I dwell among this people whom I I By the Will of Apollo 119  | neither love nor trust . So much you must concede to me , Demosthenes . For now I have another debt to pay , which I owe to Apollo , and in that service I will join with Philip or any other , Greek or barbarian , who seeks to avenge the god . This too you shall grant me . By the schemes of your demagogues and their unholy alliances I will not be bound . But against my city I will never lift my spear , for you have spoken to me a great word , not to be forgotten ; and when you call I will come . " " Go , " he said ; " what you ask is conceded . But I shall hold you to your pledge . " The payment from Phormion was soon arranged . He greeted me with all the courtesy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " has prospered in our hands and the sum is nearly doubled . Take what part you will . " And before I departed , despite my protestations , Demosthenes had rescued for me my uncle 's hoard , or the main part of it ; for even then the sycophants feared his tongue like a drawn sword and hastily withdrew their claims , accepting what he would allow . So , after no long delay , amply furnished with good Attic drachmas and leading two well laden asses , I passed from Athens by the double gateway toward Eleusis . And here I took leave of my friend , who had walked beside me thus far . " Some day , " he said , " I would see that prophetess of yours . " For I had told him much of Doria . " It may happen , " I answered , " that a day will come when I shall wish to entrust her to your protection .

Startled by the noise , the women rushed forth , and Doria , speeding down the path , met me with such a greeting that I could give heed to her only , while the dog for a season had his will with the beasts . " 0 Cylon , " she murmured , as I lifted her up , still all too lightly , till her cheek pressed mine , " I have been so lonely in this place ; it was worse than the sickness .

" Be still , and if you love me , Cylon , speak no impious words . Have no thought By the Will of Apollo 121  | of lingering here . Let us rather hasten , for so the god has whispered to me . He bids us go . " " Yet , on a road so long and rough ? " " You need not fear that I shall faint .

And indeed , when I sighed for a roof it was the gracious shelter of the god f'or which I pined , not this stifling thatch of reeds . For a terror came upon me , and love was so new to me , Cylon ! I almost feared you , Cylon , then . " And while I strained her to my breast , in voiceless joy , " Let us hasten on , " she urged me softly , " for the time calls , Apollo calls ; and if , " locking her fingers behind my neck as though in dread to be plucked away , " when I am weary with walking I may perch on the pack of one of those beasts you have brought , I shall not envy the great king of the Medes on his chariot beside Euphrates . " Then , at last finding speech , " Tonight , " I said , " we remain ; we will not start out on such a quest under a declining sun . " At which she laughed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of old Myrtis , in the temple . " But stilling her lips with a kiss , I went on : " Tomorrow , my gift of Apollo , you shall ride forth to seek new domains , mounted upon your beast like Dionysus of old . " " Avert the omen ! " she cried , and as I set her down raised her palms , half earnest , half in jest . " For , " said she , " I have heard another part of that sorry tale , so that I know too well into what regions at last his quest descended ; and not yet would I exchange these rugged paths of earth , through which with mingled pain and gladness we walk together , for 122 By the Will of Apollo  | those that wind through the asphodel fields in the sunless world of ghosts . " And her voice became no more than the rustle that stirs in the vines as she breathed in my ear , " For now I truly love Yu Cylon . I had never dreamed that I a could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be so happy . " That night I followed Coptas to the fold , where he kept a smouldering fire within the pickets . " Pile on the faggots , " I bade him ; and when the blaze had mounted up and filled the place with lightI put in his hands a bag of coin . " Poise it , " I said ; and he sucked his breath as he felt the weight . " A mina of silver , " I told him . " Pour it out . " The newly minted drachmas fell ringing and lay in a shining heap . His eyes gleamed . Such a sheen of silver he had never beheld . " Count it , " I said . " Make sure that the sum is what I say . " He counted slowly with trembling hands , laying the coins in little parcels  --  ten , of ten each . " It is so ; an Attic mina , as you say . " His tongue was parched with a fever of avarice ; his voice cackled . " Do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from me ? " His fingers twitched ; he stared at my throat , but forbore . I laughed . " It is yours , for the keep of the child . But let me hear no report of knavery . You will be watched . " He clapped his hands upon it with a gasp of relief ; he crouched over it as I have seen a wolf guard his prey . Then , " There will be much expense , " he muttered ; " to rear a babe is much expense . There will soon be need of more , for the cost " " Expense ! " I cried . " Be silent , or I will break your head . The child will cost you little trouble and no silver ; the woman will do all . This you will add to your hoard . " " I have no hoard . How should Coptas have a hoard ? If the By the Will of Apollo 123  | woman has told you that , she lies . She is loose of tongue . What hoard ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , but to you it is a hoard . And now you may even fear thieves ; the child has brought you wealth , not loss . Yet if you are faithful , more will be sent in due season . But if you betray your trust , as the god flayed Marsyas so shall Lachas do by you , and shall bring me your hide to be a cover for my shield , that I may ever be reminded to trust no man of Phocis . " He beat his brow upon the earth and swore by Dionysus and Demeter and Persephatta , though calling them by other names . But I trusted more to his fear of Lachas . At daybreak , as the crowing of the cocks came up faintly from far below , I so readjusted the packs that Doria might ride at ease upon the bedding ; and when we had tasted bread and wine amid a din of blessings from Mataea , ungracious silence from Coptas , and thankless outcry from the babe , we departed , Doria and I , down the steep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slow progress . Yet by noon we had reached the nearest village in the valley , a straggle of houses almost empty of men . While I was still in Athens I had learned that Philip was in Thessaly and that Onomarchus had sent against him an army under Phayllus , his brother ; and later , as I passed through Thebes , I heard that Phayllus was worsted , and that Onomarchus had marched to his aid with all his forces  --  twenty thousand men , it was said  --  while Philip 's array , swelled by Thessalian cavalry , was scarcely less . So much I knew already ; and now we found the Phocian villages so drained of manhood that little guard was kept and none ventured to detain us . We stole through without obstruction and made our way to the pass of Anopaea , for  | again I avoided the garrison at Thermopylae . In this wild region of cliffs and pines I feared lest I might meet Lachas , which was far from my wish , but I saw nothing of him or his like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a traveler encumbered with donkeys and a woman , let us by without question . Yet in the valleys beyond we met alarms , with rumors of a great battle impending , so that I hastened on with all speed ; for Doria now seemed as tireless as those beguiling sprites who are said to haunt these forests , in whom any show of woman 's weakness is mere feigning . She would ride only at intervals and for the most part walked beside me , from hour to hour more like her with whom I had scaled Parnassus . Soon , as we reached the plains , we began to meet stragglers , with daunting reports of Philip 's defeat before Pherae  --  that he himself was slain , his army broken and fleeing ; whereupon , though doubtful of the truth , I made the greater haste , for I knew that such numbers could not move quickly even in flight if they still held together . And on the third day we overtook them , not far from Larissa , where Philip , not dead but much confounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  with small success , it seemed , for the men , twice beaten , were utterly dismayed and would scarcely keep the ranks . Almost in open mutiny I found them  --  insolent , jibing at me and leering at Doria , though a veil of sindon screened her face . Yet the name of Philip was still held in some fear , and when I demanded to be led before him , hearing command in my voice and seeing me no weakling , they brought me into his presence . But here I was much abashed . Thwarted and wrathful he stood by his horse , gripping hard on his horseman 's spear .  | He turned upon me with lowering looks ; he had forgotten me long since . " Who are you that dare intrude upon the king , and in such an hour bring women to my camp ? " The guards around him laughed . I broke in hastily , as there was need . " I am Cylon  --  Cylon of Athens , to whom you once gave a pledge , and I seek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " He appeared but half to hear me . The scar of a deep gash , newly healed , that seamed his cheek beneath the eye which it had made sightless , grew livid as his anger rose . " An envoy of enemies , with some prattle about promises ! Perhaps you would like to chatter to me about Amphipolis ? Begone , before I strike you dead . " " I love Athens as little as you , " I retorted , " and care less for Amphipolis . I tell you I am Cylon , whom you knew of old . We were boys ; we met in Thebes . We broke bread together at the house of Pammenes , where a promise was given which the king shall redeem . " " Cylon ? ? that crooked name ! " With an effort of memory he recalled me . He almost smiled . " A most beggarly name ! but the boy was no beggar , not he ; a stout fighter , almost as strong as I , and at casting , a prodigy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rash of spirit , ready to brave Philip to his face ? You are little changed , I think . Do you still esteem me such a son of Hercules that you track a fleeing army to find me and seek my service in disaster ? " " There is service enough to be had in these days , and the Phocian bids high for spears ; but so I have made my choice , and I hold the king to his promise . " " Cylon , " said he , " this is a childish fancy of long ago that  | you call up , and the promise you had was made not by the king but by a boy . Yet since it was the word of Philip , freely given as to a friend , it shall be honored , and beyond what was promised , for you shall serve among my guards . " He looked about him sternly . " I will have beside me one stout heart , though my own Macedonians fail me , " he concluded . But lest he assume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I warned him , " I bind myself . When this is ended and the god avenged , I am free . We will then confer further . " " Would you limit your service ? " So he began , with heat , but added quickly , " Let it be as you will . I know your thought and esteem you none the less for that . Traitors are cheap and frequent ; I find them useful , but not as friends . " He took my hand , which he crushed a little , as if in reminiscence , then turned toward Doria with a heavy frown . " Whatever you have beneath that veil , dispose of it without delay . At this time I will have no women about the camp . " " You shall make an exception , " I told him . " I bring you a manifest sign from Apollo , a pledge of victory . It is Doria , of the temple , she who spoke from the tripod . " " The Pythia ? She that denounced the Phocian before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you lie to me , Cylon ? Yet I have heard strange tales . " " Then hear the truth . " And I told him briefly what had befallen in Delphi . " This seems beyond belief , " he cried . " I can not fully credit the story , though it holds with what I know . Yet , were it true  --  but first I will see this prodigy . " He snatched away the veil , and Doria , fair as a goddess and as unafraid , stood before him . He gazed upon her with admiration , more than I liked ; yet some awe was in his look . She did not quail under his eye . " It is true , " she said ? " all  | that Cylon has told you . I am she whose voice Apollo has chosen to utter his will  --  at Delphi , and now to you ; and no prison might avail to hinder his purpose . Can you not believe ? For you are he whom the god has appointed to wreak his vengeance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without faith , trusting rather to men , your spear is fallen from your hand . But again Apollo bids you lift it in his name , and bear it to victory . " Now the mind of Philip was ever hard to fathom , and though he did reverence to the gods when it suited his aims , I have sometimes questioned whether he had faith in any god ; for I noted that when he most invoked the gods , then he was least to be credited . Yet , whatever moved him to it , he bowed his head ; the king bent before Doria . " I shall doubt no more , " he said . " It is indeed the Pythia , by whose tongue Apollo speaks , and I am but the servant of the god . I will assemble my rabble of blustering runaways , and with words like these Apollo 's priestess shall inspire their hearts ; then , under the auspices of the god , I will lead them to victory . " The trumpet brayed its call . Already a rumor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revelation , a prodigy  --  pervaded the camp ; and the men of the phalanx , brought to some order and marshaled by their officers , gathered on the low , wide slope that rose toward Ossa till the hillside was hidden with the gleam of arms and the glare of fierce faces . At its foot was a platform , hastily made of wagons with planks laid across , over which a linen cloth had been spread . Behind stood Philip with his guards , backed by t he Macedonian cavalry ; and at the king 's command I lifted l ) oria to this rude scaffold . At first she stood before them as white and as motionless as a marble statue upon its pedestal  --  stood mute , as if in  | terror , until a sudden tumult of impatience shook the spears as when wind strikes a thicket . My heart sank , my face blanched like hers ; Philip ground his teeth and cursed all women . Hoarse cries arose , but rough hands beat the clamor to silence . For now she advanced a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Delphi . " Few heard , but a hush swept back and all grew still . " Out of the tomb I am come , by Apollo 's will , to speak his message . " Like the voice of a a ghost it seemed . And here one of those nearest called loudly : " It is true ; it is Apollo 's Doria , she who was sealed in the rock . For this I saw with my eyes , and fled because of the sacrilege . " And another : " Yea , and he who stands by the wheel of the cart was cast in with her ; for this too we saw . Yet the god has led them forth . " And a great shout went up : " It is the Pythia , from Delphi . Be silent ; let us hear the message of the god . " But some from the hilltop cried : " We can not hear ; her words are blown from us and lost on the wind . Why should the god speak to men of arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reed ? " " May not a god speak with what tongue he will ? " Her tone rang clearer , and in the eager quiet pierced far . " Has he not made tongues of the leaves of trees and shaped words from the moan of winds ? And if he has chosen to open the door of a sepulcher to lead forth his priestess , the last of all who served him thus , that he still might use the tongue with which he spoke from the tripod to utter his warning to you , will you blame his choice and refuse to believe his word ? " And they shouted : " We believe . Mighty is Apollo . Yet tell us this : why has the god forsaken those who fight for his glory ? " By the Will of Apollo 129  | She stood in the waning light like a spirit such as they deemed her , pale as the Queen of the Dead and as regal . Her voice was changed ; its girlish flutings ceased . It now seemed , not weak , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a far-off sky , filling every ear . They listened with quaking hearts . " Thus speaks Apollo by the lips of her who sat upon the tripod . Not for the god do you fight , nor for his glory , else none might withstand you . Is the god 's eye blinded , not to see your deeds ? Is his ear deaf to your profaneness ? Does he behold his emblems in your camp ? Or his name  --  does he hear it spoken in honor among you ? Not for him do you fight , but for spoils ; and not for Apollo 's glory , but his own , does your captain lead you against the cities . Shall the god be mocked , yet give you victory ? Shall he lend you his name as a screen for your greed , or a king 's ambition ? Are the men of Phocis worse than you ? Because of the rankness of your offenses the god looks down in wrath upon you , and your spear is broken and your feet are turned in flight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that profane his cause , and for a pretext call yourselves the god 's avengers ? For your own unworthiness you have suffered defeat , and your punishment is but begun . Soon shall the god bend his bow , and his arrows shall fall as at Ilium . " Groans sounded from the hillside . Some wept ; some clamored vows ; some sought to pray , but found their words unfit . Even Philip had flinched a little as she spoke ; he bit his lip , yet smiled in triumph . A cry began : " The god is angry ; what shall we do to appease the god ? Apollo 's Doria , what shall we do ? " For this name , uttered by the deserter from Delphi , they caught up . A faint blush tinged her pallor ; but the answer came in a  | voice that seemed not hers , still falling like an echo from an unseen sky . " Do you ask of Doria how the god may be appeased ? Know this : not wholly may he be appeased ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seed , will grow and bear its fruit . So speaks the god to the king , by Doria 's tongue . And this also : not by the sins of men are his purposes made vain , but while they think to gain their ends they do his will , and through their wickedness is justice done . " I glanced toward Philip . A light sneer quivered on his face , but in an instant vanished , while all the army shouted : " The king shall lead us as Apollo bids . There shall be expiation . Voice of the god , command us what to do . " " Then hear the will of the god of Delphi . Never by any expiation is a wrong made right ; yet there shall be expiation . Yonder , " and her left arm was lifted toward Olympus , " yonder the vale of Tempe lies , and the laurel groves of Apollo . " " Within a day 's march , " they cried . " In that spot the god himself was purified of old , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purge yourselves of all uncleanness ; if any shall speak foul words of ill omen , let him be cast out from the camp . There you shall consecrate your arms to Apollo 's service ; thence you shall bear his tokens . Let his name be revered . " " All this shall be done . And then ? " " If you would avert Apollo 's vengeance , fulfill his vengeance . " And here her voice began to falter , but again it swelled . " Make true your false professions . So shall his wrath be turned upon his despoilers , who shall fall at your onset like the ripe barley before the reapers . Such is the god 's command and his promise , voiced by his Pythia . But By the Will of Apollo 131  | ask no more , for the voice of her who speaks grows weak and her spirit faint . " They acclaimed as with one voice ; they beat upon their shields with an uproar like the crash of battle . To this she gave no heed , nor seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes upturned , and murmuring " Cylon " swayed as if to fall . But I leaped from the hub of the cart to her side ; and while they jarred the air with clamor and called on Philip to lead them to Tempe , she lay in my arms as if with the voice of the god her soul too had departed .  | I sat with Philip at his evening meal under the laurels of Tempe . Not far away a rich pavilion fluttered its curtains in the wind that blew down from the pass , and within it lay Doria , still pale and weak , but attended by the king 's physician and well served by a troop of slaves . A few days before , mounted on a gentle mare from the king 's own stables , I had borne her hither in my arms , preceded by the Macedonian cavalry , with Philip at its head , and followed by above ten thousand spearmen , Macedonians , Thessalians , Thracians , with levies from the mountains of Illyria ; and in all that godless horde @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Apollo 's Doria filled their hearts . So they still called her ; and a man from Larissa who had presumed to speak lewdly of her had been stoned from the camp , scarcely escaping with his life . On our arrival here a great sacrifice of expiation had been made , under Philip 's direction ; for Doria lay in silence under her canopy , with dull eyes , like one half lost in slumber , though when I sat beside her she would rouse a little to press my hand and whisper my name . The soldiers , r  | feasting upon the meats of the offering , were well content to linger for a time ; indeed , they would march no step without Doria . Philip himself seemed in no haste , but watched the pass with anxious glances , as if expectant . Me he kept beside him and used as a trusted friend  --  partly in policy , I think , for he was cold to his Macedonians and made them feel his displeasure . So it chanced that I and no other was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little withdrawn , within call but out of easy earshot ; and as we conversed I could not keep my eyes from the ghastly scar that disfigured his face and had cost him so dear . This he noted . " I had it at Methone , " he explained impatiently , " by a bolt shot from an engine ; its range was better than my guess . Such sometimes is the price of cities , though most may be bought more cheaply , with gold . Yet by this mischance , which befell me through sheer carelessness and without excuse , I have learned the value of these engines and shall put them to more use . " " For a soldier in the ranks , " I said , " such scars are seemly since by the hazard of wounds he earns his bread . But for one who is a king  --  is it worth it , Philip ? " " It is worth it , " he answered ? " and for a king beyond others . Without these hazards nothing can be won . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the field of battle ; I will leave some memory of me in the minds of men . Glory is something , well worth an eye , and power is more than glory ; but greatest is the joy of winning , and while fortune gives pie that , let her take what she will . " He glanced at the guards and lowered his voice . " But , " said he , " do I seem so grievously marred ? My physician is accounted skillful ; the wound is well healed and the scar not much to be noted I think , unless by a friend at close view . "  | My thought was different , but I was not so rude as to utter it . " Well , " said he , " the use of the eye is lost , I admit ; but that vexes me less than this defeat of my army . I will yet crucify that Onomarchus . " " He is worthy of the worst , " I answered bitterly , " for so he deals with others . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Through the lips of your Doria . By the god in whose name she speaks , she has done me good service . Yet I have not trusted wholly to the garlands of Apollo . " " Philip , " I asked him , " do you trust at all to the aid of the god  --  Apollo or any other ? " He laughed . " Not more than is needful , it may be . But this I will freely concede : to a king the gods are often helpful . And I have put my trust in Apollo 's Doria , as the spearmen call her , though , for some moments , I feared I had lost . Cylon , I have staked all upon this venture . I have drained Pella and stripped my garrisons . Eight thousand spears are now on the march to join us . Like a ram , I have only drawn back to butt the harder ; and with the god 's pledge and a stiffened phalanx I will drive the Phocian into the sea . " Yet still we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restless . Presently it was even rumored that Doria lay dead in her tent , whereupon the Thessalians began to mutter that the god had withdrawn his favor , and so many cast down their laurels that the ground was littered with wilting sprays . But when , at the king 's command , I led her forth , and they as they passed in review saw her leaning upon my arm and smiling upon them , their blasphemous tongues were stilled ; and scattering through the groves they plucked fresh garlands and renewed their vows .  | Then , on the evening of the fourth day after , a trumpet sounded from the pass , anda column of spears , flashing red in the sunset , defiled from its shadows . Two by two they came , and the slow line lengthened to forty stades of marching men , followed by squadrons of horse and a troop of Thracian targeteers . A great shout of welcome went up from the camp . " Apollo 's Pythia fulfills her promise , " they cried . " Who now shall withstand us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Philip to obey the god . He was not averse . " Tomorrow we march , " so he bade the herald proclaim , " and let every helmet be wreathed , for without that token none shall have part in this service . " We now moved southward by easy stages , Doria riding close behind the front in a covered wagon , well guarded . At each halt we were joined by more Thessalians , and every recruit came wearing his token , for the word had gone out . Beyond Larissa we met some troops of hostile horse , but when Philip had launched against them the Macedonian cavalry they were scattered like chaff tossed in the winnowing pan ; and after this , Onomarchus retired before us , finding his army daunted and his Thessalian allies not to be trusted . Not even at Pherae did he make a stand , but hastened on to the coast near Pagasae , where Athenian ships were stationed ; for Athens , with little love for the Phocian , was loath to see him overthrown by Philip , already fearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was forced to give battle , forming his phalanx in dense array on the plain above the beach . Twelve deep he made it , not daring to extend a thinner line , shielding his flanks with Thessalian horse . But Philip formed his spearmen sixteen deep , though it narrowed his front ; for he trusted all to a single stroke . On the 136 By the Will of Apollo  | right he stationed a squadron of recently gathered horse , mainly Larissan , but on the left he marshaled his Macedonian cavalry , compact and steady , held like a hound in a leash . The wagon conveying Doria he sent to the rear , under heavy escort , though disciplined men were precious . Not far away , where the slope gave an open view , he sat on his horse , keeping me beside him , well mounted like himself . When all was ready he gave the signal for attack . A low murmur ran through the files as the watchword passed ; then it rose loud and clear , " Apollo 's vengeance and victory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Macedonians ; but the ranks shut and five ranges of tall sarissas bent down at the front in a thorny thicket of outreaching points , while the mass of upright spears behind swayed like reeds in the wind as the phalanx advanced . Then Philip loosed his cavalry , which leaped like a bolt from a catapult , and almost as the two main lines encountered smote the enemy 's flank on the side unsheltered by the shield . The opposing horsemen , few and irresolute , were scattered like dust under a broom ; and now I saw what I had not thought possible , a well-ordered phalanx broken by the charge of mounted men . For the hostile formation crumbled as when an earthen pot is struck by a stone ; and over its shattered fragments the slowly advancing sarissas drove like a plow drawn by yoked oxen . The rest was mere pursuit and slaughter ; for though the Macedonians held their ranks , the men of Larissa rode down the fugitives and Thracian footmen ranged the field with gory knives to kill and strip . Philip had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wreckage of battle and exploring the medley of carnage with a careful eye .  | " Yonder , " I called , " he rides ! " For I had caught sight of Onomarchus , borne on a great horse , headed toward the sea . We spurred after him . " Alive , if possible , " cried Philip , as we dashed through the drift of fleeing men . " Strike down his horse . " " I can strike surely , " I told him , " at some sixty paces , but at a hundred and from a horse , all is chance . As to those casts of heroes of which they tell , it is doubtless true that some god aided them ; for without a god no mortal can strike with any assurance at such a distance . " We galloped on at utmost speed and gained somewhat ; but the fear of worse than death was in the tyrant 's soul , and he was still too distant for a cast as he crossed the beach , where a huddle of panic-shaken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward the ships . His horse balked at the breach of the sea ; he sprang down and splashed through the shallows ; he was far out and up to his neck in the heaving swell as we reined on the shore . On the nearest deck stood men with a coiled rope , ready to cast it to his aid . I slipped from my horse to the sand . " Take this , " said Philip . " It is from Athens  --  none better . " And receiving his javelin , lighter and of better balance than mine , I flung it , almost from his hand , with all my strength . It soared like an arrow , then , with the swoop of a hawk , descended upon its quarry ; for as he spread his arms to swim , it struck his back between the shoulder-blades and drove downward through his breast , so that he plunged forward in the reddening brine and wallowed with the waves . " A well-cast dart , " said Philip , settling back upon his i  | horse . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marred his own vengeance , for the fellow is dead . Yet I will keep my promise to his shade . " As the swing of the tide wafted the carcass landward , a troop of the guards rode up in anxious haste . " You are negligent , " said the king . Some fear was on their faces . " We were cumbered by captives , " they explained . " You need not have been cumbered long . For these you will get no ransom ; they shall fare like their master . Look ! " He pointed to the corpse , now tossing in the shallows . " Pluck it out . " They dragged it up the bank , a sodden mass , transfixed with the wooden shaft , oozing with blood . " Spit it upon a pole and set it up , " he commanded them . " A headless sarissa will serve . " For we had seen many such lying on the field . But at this they demurred . " So vile a task is fitter for a slave , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a Massagetan they say , more apt for such business if reports be true . " " You are right . His own servant still shall serve him . Yet , by the glory of him who flayed Marsyas , it is an easy guess whom he had in mind when he brought the brute with him . " They led forth Bogas . He stood trembling , like a mountain cat caught in a snare , with glittering eyes that sought the king in sidelong glances . But when they had made him understand , " What use do it now ? " he muttered . " Dead man have no feel . No fun , do it now . " " When I impale for entertainment , " said Philip coldly , " I will choose a Massagetan for my sport . Slave , do you palter before the king ? "  | The barbarian cowered and obeyed . Soon , with the help of other captives , the pole was hoisted , and the hideous shape swayed in mid air , a bait for crows . Philip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he commanded them , " set up this beastly slave beside his master . Good companions , these ! He shall have by him his own tormentor , even in Tartarus . And since the Massagetan has taught you the pleasure as well as the practice of his art , let him miss no part of the joy of it . " They laughed , but again demurred . " We are no Massagetans . Here are captives enough , who for the promise of life will do anything . " And as they spoke , a great voice boomed from behind them . " Yea , by the hound of the pit , for my life I would flay alive any son of my father but one , and account it no ill bargain  --  much more a brother bandit who already owes me a forfeit for betrayal on Parnas . " With that we heard the snap of bursting cords , and the huge form of Lachas lurched through the press , towering above the rest by head and shoulders . " It is the Arcadian from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the man with the dog , who made sacrifice at Pherae . " And another , " It is the great thief of the mountains , who serves that Hermidion whom no man has seen , but he dwells apart and rules all bandits . " I perceived that Lachas blenched a little as his eyes met mine , but he turned to Philip with a face of brass . " King , I will do your pleasure on Bogas , but not without a pledge . And four others I shall need to hold him ; these too you shall spare for that service . This done  --  and the deed in the doing is of no sweet relish , though , as a jest , of much merit and doubtless worthy of a king  --  I am then minded to enter your  | service , for I would now serve Apollo . King , with one hand I can drive you a sarissa through any shield , or toss it like a peltast 's dart . For rich spoils I defied the god . But since the tyrant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temple spent , I see in sacrilege no present hope of safety or profit . Against Apollo and the Macedonian horse it is vain to contend , and I would join with them . " dl Philip surveyed him cooly , yet not without admiration . " I commend your insolence , " said he . " It has saved you from a wet death , but let it now be abated . I grant your terms . You shall head a file ; such a frame I have scarcely seen . Four others you shall choose and they shall live . " Then , to the 1 guards , " Let the rest be flung in the sea to drown like rats , " IIII he commanded . " Spare none for ransom . This we owe to the god for his aid , and so we avenge him . " 1,1 A wail of terror arose from the captives , as many as heard ; but to Philip it seemed no more than the bleating of goats at the altar . Again he turned to Lachas . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would live fulfill them quickly . " 11 But Lachas , although he had faced Philip with measureless assurance , now seemed uneasy . He looked from the king to me and bowed his head . " Captain , " he asked humbly , " is it permitted ? " " Obey the king , " I answered . This Philip heard and noted , but his face was a mask . " Perform your task , " he said sternly , " and make no more question . " Lachas selected his helpers ; they seized Bogas by the arms and threw him down . Philip wheeled his horse , and I folP lowed swiftly , leaving the accursed wretch in shrieking expectation . At last , as the canopied wagon of Doria came in sight , the king drew bridle .  | " Why did the fellow call you captain ? " he asked abruptly . " He was under my command at Pherae , " I answered , " but because of misconduct deserted . " And I told him the tale of the sacrifice .  | A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Apollo . From a shelving cliff , beneath which the surf broke loudly , three thousand fettered captives were cast into the sea , in plain view of the watching ships that already were swinging their oars to depart ; and the white moonlight was foully polluted with shrieks and curses as the victims fell , to strangle in the waves . A godless crew they were , unworthy of pity , yet scarcely worse than some who were flinging them down  --  among whom I saw Lachas , flushed purple with Thessalian wine , pushing them over by ranks with the broadside of a pike . It seemed out of measure . I turned toward Philip  --  for now we had ridden back to the shore , and I stood beside him as he surveyed the scene and made sure that none were spared . " What need of this ? " I said . " The god is fully avenged . The tyrant hangs on a stake , and many thousand lie unburied on the field . " " And there shall lie till their bones bleach . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gathering to give them such burial as suits their deeds . But why feed the fishes too , with living men ? For these were mere hirelings , selling their 142  | spears ; like Lachas , they would have served you in the ranks as well as any . Or , if you can put no trust in them , sold in the market they would bring you a cart-load of silver to pay others . You are casting treasure into the sea . " So I spoke , with the freedom of friendship . And he answered , taking no offense , " Cylon , you offer me counsel like such an Athenian envoy as at first I thought you , seeking to turn me from my purpose with clever phrases and to show the king his folly . Many such I have heard  --  and still must hear , it is likely . But like them , you advise me ill . These malefactors will serve me better by the terror of their death than with impious spears ; their howls , as they pay their forfeit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the ends of Hellas . Even Athens will quail when her ships bring this tale to Piraeus . And as for the money I sacrifice , do I not dig from the mines of Pangaeus in a single year , in pure gold , more than twenty times the price that might be had by sparing these desecrators of Apollo 's temple ? Concede it , Cylon : the king sees clearer with a single eye than you with full vision . " " I admit the rest , " I told him , " but Athens will not quail . In that you are wrong . While her orators wrangle and danger seems uncertain and remote , she drowses . Struck by the lash , she will rouse herself . " He kicked a clod with his buskined foot . " We soon shall know , " he answered shortly , " better than prophets . I shall march to the pass . " But that night , in a great pavilion reared in the midst of the camp , he held a revel , and from this a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summoned his Macedonians and showed them more favor , placing Antipater on his left , and Parmenio , who had led the phalanx , on  | his right , with Attalus next , and many more beyond  --  all his chief officers , according to rank . I too was present , for Philip would not have it otherwise , but in the lowest place , alone on my couch . " What is this renegade Greek from Athens doing here ? " grumbled Attalus , as he drained his cup and signaled for more . " The king 's will , here and elsewhere , " said Philip , and frowned him to silence . Scarcely , even in Thebes , had I seen such drinking . They swilled the hot Thessalian wine in great goblets , mixed half and half ; yet soon Philip bade the slaves mix it stronger . " We drink tonight to the god 's glory , and mine , " he said ; and already his tongue was thick . So the riot grew , with ribald songs and foul clamor , until Philip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a Cyclops , began to call for dancing-girls to be led in . " All have been banished from camp , " they told him , " by the king 's order . " Whereupon he frothed at the lips and cursed his own discipline . " The king has been worshipful , " sneered Attalus . " Save those who attend the holy Pythia in her rolling shrine , no maids are permitted . " Philip glared upon him . " You presume too far ; it lacks little I strike you with my spear . Yet , by the golden throne of Apollo , these at least shall grace our banquet , and the Pythia shall sit beside the king on his couch , that all may see how she is held in honor . A fair maid , that has pleased the king . By the Lord of Delphi , we will have them in . " Thus Philip , rearing on his couch , all reason lost ; but on the rest an ominous silence fell . Some feared the god  --  or if not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ,  | even to stoning , and deemed her the pledge of victory . The king stared about him and fingered his javelin . " Do any presume to make question ? " he muttered . Antipater strove to whisper in his ear , but was thrust aside . I sprang to my feet . " Philip , " I cried , " this shall not be . " " Who dares deny the king ? " " The god of Delphi . " Still the Thracian frenzy possessed him . " Is Apollo greater than I ? " he raved hoarsely , " a god who could not defend his own temple than I who have so gloriously avenged him ? " Again Antipater sought his ear , but in vain . I too was well steeped in wine , but this menace sobered me quickly . I spoke slowly , in steady tones . " Listen , " I said . " You are not now Philip but a madman , beside yourself , as when Hercules struck down Iphitus . And so , bs ' killing me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else ; and in so doing you will have lost a friend , and the god 's favor , and the esteem of men , and the fruits of victory . Philip  --  I , Cylon , speak to Philip , not to his wine  --  this must not be . " Of these words some part at least pierced the fumes that beclouded him . A brief gleam of understanding shone in his eye . But , as it went from him , " Who shall restrain the king ? " he demanded . " The king , and no other , " I answered . I saw him struggle with his whirling thoughts as one who labors to rouse from troubled sleep . With a mighty effort he hound himself . " Cylon , " he said , and his voice quavered as when one calls across a blustering wind , " there is ever a strain of madness in our blood  --  it is Hera 's curse upon us ; hut again I am Philip . The king has spoken no such words , hut the wine that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wine  | be forgotten . " He rose unsteadily , staying himself on Parmenio 's shoulder . " This is ended . Go , all of you , to your rest . At dawn we march . " As the banquet broke , Antipater pressed beside me . " Cylon , " he said-to me , " though but a hireling Greek , you have served the king this night like a subject . " " Far better , " I boasted , " than any dull-witted Macedonian . " For now the wine was coming back upon me . The next morning , as I rode by Philip , a little apart from the rest , he said : " Cylon , last night , when I sat over-long at my cups , I fell asleep and had an evil dream , unworthy of a king  --  for the wine was rank . From this I was roused by the voice of a friend . No more of that ; there shall be no further mention of it between us . But this I will say : hereafter all that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to this I will swear , if you like , with any oath . " But I answered , smiling , " By oaths , I think , the king is not unduly bound , but by his own free promise he may be bound . I ask no more . " And he , reaching from his horse , clasped my hand , and no more was said . All that day we marched , and the next , reaching Lamia at nightfall and camping in the plain . Yet when , as we skirted the coast on the third morning , we drew near the western gate of the pass , we beheld in the offing the ships of Athens already arrived . A fair sight they seemed , as they swung in a wavering line on the roll of the sea , but to Philip most unwelcome . He smote his thigh and swore Macedonian oaths , cursing the slowness of his march , though the men were spent . Then , turning to me ? " Cylon , you warned me rightly . Your Athenians have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sight of a whip , but more like a nest of wasps , best stilled by a smoke of words . I have stirred them unduly ;  | hereafter I will deal with them according to their nature . " He sent forward scouts , and when he learned that the defenders of the pass were no fugitives from the battle , but Athenian hoplites from the ships , " Who leads them ? " he asked . " He who is called Phocion , " they told him , " a stout soldier whom the people of Athens hold in such esteem that year after year they elect him to office . " Again Philip turned to me . " An honest man , " I assured him , " blunt in speech but brave in action . He will listen to no bribe . " " I know him well , " said he ; " honest indeed , but of less discernment than prudence , and his blundering , unbought caution has sometimes served my ends in your city . But no traitor , and while Phocian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Will you force the lock ? " " It might be done ; but with yonder triremes watching the coast , not quickly , and meanwhile all the hives of Hellas would be humming . No , Cylon , the hour is not yet . " " Then , " said I , " it is still permitted me to continue with you , and I ask nothing better . " He faced me with a startled look . " You had thought to leave me  --  here , at the very gates of Hellas ? " " It was so agreed . For these who now opposed you ? though I own that I feel for them less than little affection  --  are yet my kin and my people , and against them I will lift no spear . But against the men of Phocis or of Pherae , or any others , I will do your will ; and right glad I am that you have decided thus . " " It was so decided on other grounds , but I would not willingly lose you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 148 By the Will of Apollo  | folly before these well-defended rocks . We march now to Pherae . " " That city is a den of vipers , the worst even in Thessaly . To crush them is a worthy adventure , and since I know the place I may be the more of service . " I struck my palms together at a sudden thought . " Listen : I have it . Already the town is ours . " And I told him my plan . He listened like one well used to hearing schemes , but before I had finished his face lighted . " Unless they throw open the gates at once this attempt shall be made . But you take upon you some risk . " " Fair hazard of war , " I answered , " and no more . " As there was now no urgency of haste , Philip somewhat relaxed his harsh discipline . The troops marched in loose order , while wagons bore their heavy shields and lances . At times , with the king 's consent , as Doria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her in the curtained shade , and the idle hours passed sweetly . For the guards  --  what some may find it hard to credit  --  did not jeer . That they saw my favor with Philip doubtless counted much , but this far more , that they esteemed me the divinely appointed servant of Apollo 's Doria . At last , on the fifth day from Thermopylae , we halted before the walls of Pherae . But the gates were shut and the towers fully manned . Made desperate by reports of the battle and what had ensued , they dared not yield and defied us in mere excess of terror . Philip rode to the front , swept the wall with a glance , and saw all . " They are stubborn , " he said , " but a quick blow will break them . " Then to me , " Take what men you like and execute your project . " I chose first ten peltasts , veterans tried in many dangers .  | To these I added Lachas , sober beyond belief after these marches . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reek of sackage and plunder , and a good revenge . I am glad to be with you . " I made no answer , but summoning Sperchon , whom I had known in the service before Delphi , I bade him follow with a reserve of fifty more , picked men of discretion . To Philip , who had not yet left me , " Set scouts about the wall , " I said , " to watch from every side and make prompt report . When a turmoil is heard within , let Parmenio assault the gates on this side , with torches and engines and no lack of clamor . Let him keep the defenders well occupied . But yourself hold ready the cavalry ? " and I named the gate . Then , as Philip departed , I led my troop by a long detour to the rear of the city , stealing in silence through the growing dusk . I watched the landmarks closely and at the edge of a certain thicket halted Sperchon . " Wait here , " I commanded , " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is io paian follow swiftly , by the way you will then find open ; if eleleu is the cry or after due interval no call is heard , return to Philip and tell him that he has lost a friend . " With the ten , and Lachas , I crept through the bushes until we reached the hidden door leading into the rock  --  well remembered , yet I could scarcely believe that I was he who once had dragged out plunder here , like a very Lachas  --  to whom now I turned and bade him draw the secret bolt . " Captain , " he said , his monstrous voice sunk to a whisper , " I had guessed it : a noble conceit for the stealing of a city . " Ile groped a moment , and the black opening gaped before us , tainting the air with its musty odors . " A shrewd scheme , yet the jest is against us if any be watching at yonder end . "  | " You first , " I ordered , " for when the trap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " " They will be well flayed in the passage , " he muttered , " and once in , there is for me no turning . But such are the miseries of greatness . " He stooped , thrust himself in , and crawled forward , clutching his short , broad-bladed pike  --  for so we all were armed , and cased in stout jackets of hide unfenced with metal . I entered next , and the rest followed after , creeping behind me with a stealthy sound like the padding of wolves . Where the roof dropped lowest I heard unvoiced curses strangling in their throats , but all drew through to the end , where Lachas bowed his neck beneath the trap . We listened , but could distinguish nothing . I touched the ankle of Lachas : " Now ! " I whispered , and with a vast heave of his body he forced up the hatch . It fell over with a crash . Then came a howl , as of someone rudely awakened . Sudden tumult filled the darkness . Already Lachas had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by those behind . Not a glimmer of light appeared , but all around us was the noise of rousing men , groping for weapons , which as they found them they hurled , much at random yet not wholly in vain . I felt a keen sting in my side and plucked from it a dart , which the tough leather of my coat had only partly stopped . I heard from Lachas such a grunt of rage and pain as when a great boar feels his flank stricken . I drove my spear at a sound and struck down a man , from whom I wrested a shield  --  none too soon  --  and crouching held it over Lachas who lay prone on the floor . A javelin crashed against it , but fell harmless . Meanwhile all the ten had emerged . " Stand close , " I called . " Press upon them ; thrust them By the Will of Apollo 151  | back . Cast no weapon , but stab with your spears , gripping short on the shaft . Harm no man clad in leather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guards , though more in number as it seemed , strove against us in mere confusion , undirected , still half numb with sleep ; they spent their spears in blind casting , striking each other more often than us . We drove them to the wall and of those before us made short work , but some , unfastening the door , rushed out into the twilight . These we followed , but halted close by the threshold , where I shouted the call to victory like a very Stentor , and my comrades joined in the cry  --  all save two , Lachas , who still lay groaning beside the hatch , and another who lay silent . Then lights appeared and more enemies , of whom we struck down one and seized his torch , but at once drew back within the guard-room , barring the door ; and before they could gather in force to break it down , Sperchon and the fifty were mounting up from the hatchway . Of these I left two with Lachas . The rest I formed in column , and unbar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed were arrayed in no order , and so reached open spaces . The din of battle was now resounding from the front , where Parmenio was assaulting the walls . Women shrieked from the upper windows ; men ran hither and thither , screaming that the city was betrayed and all would be put to the sword . Meeting no further resistance I led on at a running pace to the postern , where I threw wide the gates and dispatched messengers to Philip . Soon a thunder of hoofs was heard , and the Macedonian cavalry swept through and cleared the streets . It was barely midnight , and the town was won . And now I felt the warm blood gushing from my un
