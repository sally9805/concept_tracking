txt If you work for a company that has a pension plan or is planning to put one in , your pension rights will be virtually guaranteed under a new law enacted by Congress . President Ford will sign the measure at a Labor Day ceremony . In the face of mounting evidence that thousands of workers each year were being denied their pensions after years of toil , Congress has laid down new rules for private pension systems , including those administered iy unions . HERE 'S THE WAY your rights to pension benefits will be protected under the new law : The new pension regulations may cause economic hardships for some corporations . Story in Business . ? If your company goes broke , or in some way defaults on its promise to honor the pension rights you have earned , a new federal pension insurance plan will come to the rescue . The Federal Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp . will pay your pension benefits in an amount equal to as much as 100 per cent of your average pay during your five highest earning years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It will be financed from premiums paid by companies with pension plans . ? Your pension benefits also will be " vested . " This means that once you earn them , no one can take them away from you . Employers will have three choices in the way they vest your benefits . UNDER CHOICE NO. 1 , called " straight years vesting , " you would be eligible for full vesting  --  to receive 100 per cent of whatever amount your benefits were worth  --  after 10 years on the job , assuming you retired at age 65 . For example , if you are now 31 years old , you will be fully vested in your company'splan , if your employer chooses this option , at age 41 . UNDER CHOICE NO. 2 called " graded vesting , " you would earn 25 per cent of your pension benefits after five years on the job , 50 per cent after 10 years , and 100 per cent after 15 years . Between your 5th and 10th years , your benefits would be vested at a rate of 5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year , for example , you would be 35 per cent vested . Between your 10th and 15th years , your benefits would grow at a rate of 10 per cent a year , so that in your 14th year , you would be 90 per cent vested : . UNDER CHOICE NO. 3 , called " age weighted vesting , " your vesting rights would be computed on a somewhat different scale . When your age , plus your years of service , add up to 45 , you would be 50 per cent vested in your company 's pension fund . After that , your vesting would grow by 10 per cent a year , so that after another five years , you would be fully vested . For instance , if you are 34 years old and have worked at your company for 11 years , your vesting rights would be half of whatever you are entitled to upon retirement at age 65 . By the time you are 39 , and assuming you are in the same pension plan , you would be fully vested and would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ widow or surviving spouse of a pensioner also would be entitled to at least 50 per cent of the pensioner 's benefit . Thus , if a pensioner collecting $150 a month in benefits died , his widow would be eligible for at least $75 a month as long as she lived . THE NEW VESTING provision also helps younger workers get started at an earlier age in building up their pens i o n benefits and vesting rights . Any worker who is at least 25 years old must be taken into a company 's pension plan , if he or she has at least one year of service . Under the existing , nonregulated system , many plans do not go into operation until an employe is 30 or even older . Furthermore , if you started with your company before you reached 25 , you could be credited with up to three years toward your vesting rights , depending on how old you were when you joined the company . ? Your vesting rights , of course , do not determine how m u c h  --  in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retirement . This depends on your company 's particular plan , and the new law does not tell a company how much it should pay in benefits . The law does , however , require an orderly way of building up benefits . Again , companies are given three options . Under option No. 1 , your actual retirement benefit could grow at a yearly rate not to exceed one and one-third times the amount credited in any other year . This means a steady growth in acquiring pension benefit credits . Under option No. 2 , your company could chose to build your benefit at , say , 4 per cent a year . In 25 years , your benefit would be wholly covered and waiting for you upon retirement . Under option No. 3 , your company could choose to build your benefit on a scale proportionate to your years of service . ? The new law also allows you to take your accrued benefits , or vested rights , with you if you change jobs  --  subject to your old and new employers ' permission . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take.your benefits out of your old employer 's pension fund , you can leave them there and collect whatever fraction of your pension you are entitled to when you retire . ? Employers already having pension plans and those setting up new ones will be required to fund them adequately . ? The new law also provides rather generous tax incentives for self-employed persons and workers whose companies have no pension plan . Under the 1 a w , self-employed persons  --  depending on their annual income  --  can defer tax payments on from $750 to $7,500 of their annual income if they sock the money into a personalized pension plan . EMPLOYES WHOSE companies have no plan will be encouraged to set aside up to $1,500 a year from their own earnings for personalized pension plans . The federal tax on this money also may be deferred . In both cases , pensioners would have to pay tax  --  at the appropriate rate  --  on the monthly income from the individualized plans they created . The new law provides for a number of different effective dates , depending on what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set up their own plans , the effective date is Jan. 1 , 1974 . This is a retroactive feature . The federal insurance provision , protecting workers from the hazards of pension fund bankruptcies , also is effective as of last Jan. 1 . All pension plans not yet created will come under the provisions of the act the moment they are established . Workers not covered by a company plan but desiring to set up their own fund may begin on Jan. 1 , 1975 . All pension plans in existence before the law was enacted must comply with the law no later than Jan. 1 , 1976 . All multicompany plans run by labor unions must comply by Dec. 31 , 1980.
