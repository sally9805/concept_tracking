An Atlanta couple is harassed by obscene telephone calls after they and their eight children appear on a television commercial for a laundry detergent . The Good Samaritan , a large hospital in Los Angeles , closes down its maternity ward as the number of abortions in the area approaches the number of live births . Underused elementary schools are turned into bakeries or motels . Young people gather in Manhattan 's Central Park to honor the " nonparents of the year " and celebrate their childlessness in a " non-fertility rite " complete with dancing . <P> These scenes , which only a few years ago would have seemed unusual , even extraordinary , are becoming more common week by week across the U.S. They are part of a phenomenon that is deeply concerning social planners , politicians , businessmen and educators : the falling birth rate among Americans . Although the U.S. population is still on the rise , Americans in 1974 are producing fewer babies per family than at any time in their history . <P> <P> As a result , the country is moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at which births balance deaths . <P> This does not mean , of course , that the total number of Americans will become a constant , like the number of degrees in a triangle . Instead , the future U.S. population is likely either to fluctuate around a base point as it seeks equilibrium , like tides around a mean high-water mark , or continue to increase , but at rates even more modest than today 's . <P> Because of this gradual alteration in the U.S. population , which now stands at about 212 million , the American way of life has already begun to change in ways both obvious and subtle . Ultimately , few segments of society will remain untouched by the absence of those missing babies . Long before Z.P.G. is achieved , which some experts expect will happen around 2025 , when they expect the population to be over 260 million , the U.S. <P> will be a considerably different country than it is today . <P> The U.S. is not alone in experiencing a slowdown in population growth . A similar fall-off has been occurring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , West Germany , Japan , Hungary and Rumania , the birth rate has slowed strikingly since World War II . In a few countries-including Rumania , Argentina and Japan-there is talk of steps to increase the birth rates again in order to build up labor forces . <P> This trend has tended to be obscured , or at least overshadowed , by the wider problem of a rapidly increasing birth rate in the world as a whole . In the underdeveloped areas of Asia and Africa , which include more than half of the world 's people , the population is increasing by 2.3% a year , far faster than food supplies-a serious situation that has been severely aggravated by drought in parts of Africa and India . In Bucharest last month , a United Nations conference of demographers , scientists and government planners from 141 nations held ten days of acrimonious discussions about how to combat this 20th century version of the old Malthusian nightmare ( TIME , Sept. 9 ) . Naturally , not much tune or interest was expended on the contrary trend toward lower birth rates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economists have long known about the sharpening decline in the U.S. birth rate , the public at large
