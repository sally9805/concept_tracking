Ever since Consumer Advocate Ralph Nader first forced them to recognize their responsibilities for their products , manufacturers have regularly recalled such items as automobiles and television sets found to be dangerous or defective . Now General Electric has issued what may well be the ultimate recall : 487 heart pacemakers , almost all of them in the chests of patients . <P> The device is a relatively recent innovation . Most pacemakers , implanted in the chest muscles under the collarbone , send out electric impulses that actually set the heartbeat rate . But G.E . ' s $850 standby , or demand , unit is designed to assist hearts that need only intermittent stimulation . It works only when the patient 's heart rate slows below normal . After G.E . received word of a malfunction in one unit , it conducted tests which showed that some of the devices were pacing too rapidly . An unwanted increase in the heart rate reduces the time during which blood remains in the cardiac chambers and prevents the chambers from filling completely . The effect is a kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could , if uncorrected , bring on a heart attack . <P> The defect is not in G.E . ' s basic design , but in one of the pacemaker 's parts . A subcontractor for one of the unit 's circuits changed the cement used in its manufacture , unwittingly choosing one that can transmit electric current . This supplies more power from the built-in battery than is needed and affects the governor on the mechanism . <P> G.E . keeps a list of surgeons who have ordered the unit , and three weeks ago the company began notifying them quietly of the problem . As far as is known , the error has not yet proved damaging to any patient . But it is proving expensive to the manufacturer and inconvenient to some patients . G.E. , which has replaced almost all of the devices , is paying for the substitutions . Replacement involves a 15-minute operation and several days of observation in a hospital at a total price of about $1,500 per patient .               @ @ @ @ @ @
