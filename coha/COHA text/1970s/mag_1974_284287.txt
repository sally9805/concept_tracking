" Discrimination based solely on the color of a man 's skin can not be defended , " said the burly , mustachioed Ambassador to the United Nations . That truism would probably have passed unnoticed except for the identity of the speaker . He was Roelofse F. ( " Pik " ) Botha , permanent representative for South Africa . Botha 's concession came too late to block a Black African resolution calling for South Africa 's expulsion from the U.N .
