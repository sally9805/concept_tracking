If Ponce de Len were alive today , he would know exactly where to find the Fountain of Youth : in Boston Garden . It was there last week that Celtic Forward John Havlicek , a venerable 34 , ran and shot , almost singlehanded , the defending N.B.A. champion New York Knicks out of this year 's playoffs . Havlicek was unstoppable , averaging 30 points and 41 minutes of playing time per game in the Celtics ' 4-1 annihilation of the Knicks . For the Celtics , their reward was a trip to Milwaukee to play the Bucks and a chance to win their first championship since the last Celtic dynasty ended in 1970 . <P> When the Celtics won the title in 1969 , Havlicek was already a seventh-year pro . He was a leading scorer in the N.B.A. and the top point producer for Boston . He had all the credentials of a superstar ; on any other team he would have been one . In Boston there were obstacles . Namely : Bill Russell and Sam Jones , both fixtures of Red Auerbach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Today Havlicek is still a leading scorer in the league and Boston 's most prolific shooter . This time , though , " Hondo " Havlicek is the undisputed star . He showed why against the Knicks . In the fourth game , which the Celtics needed to win to take a commanding 3-1 lead , Havlicek played all but three minutes , scored 36 points , called a critical final play , then executed it to ice the game . In the fifth game , Havlicek led the scoring with 33 points and played all 48 minutes . <P> Not bad for a twelve-year player . Red Auerbach , now the Celtics ' general manager , puts it this way : " John Havlicek is what I always thought a Celtic should be . " Indeed , in play and personality Havlicek is the classic team performer . On the court he seems tireless . " He is in perfect physical shape , " says Auerbach . " The man does n't sweat . " With his limitless energy , Havlicek , a forward who will play guard when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leads the famous Celtic fast break , racing downcourt to drive on the basket , shoot from outside or , more often , pass the ball to a teammate . Though Havlicek has uncanny aim with his passes and shots , his style is anything but flashy . " He takes charge in a quiet , unobtrusive way , " says Auerbach . " I did n't think he 'd be able to fill Russell 's shoes when the big man left , but of course he has . " Says Havlicek : " The Celtics have always had an older person to try to pass along some of the team philosophy . I 've learned to fill that role to a certain extent . " <P> Though his annual salary tops $200,000 , Havlicek lives modestly with his wife and two young children in a middle-class suburb outside Boston . In the offseason , they move to an unpretentious home in Columbus , Ohio , about 100 miles west of the small town of Lansing where Havlicek grew up . When his playing career ends , Havlicek hopes , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work around Columbus as an assistant college coach , but I 'll concentrate on my housewares business there . And I 'm going to learn to ski . " The way Havlicek is running these days , it will be some time before he tries the slopes .
