Confronted with Paris ' stiff prices , many a visiting American has wondered how the French manage to live at all well on their monthly salaries , which average far below U.S. scales . The answer is that Frenchmen do not get by on their salaries alone . Thanks to an elaborate system of vacation bonuses , workers receive up to 14 months ' pay a year . Fringe benefits-from subsidized lunches to company-paid housing-are far more generous than those in the U.S. or Britain . Today Frenchmen are more than ever enjoying the good life , evident in the brisk trade of big department stores and even such luxury shops in Paris as Hermes and Chez Franck . Workers ' purchasing power went up by 5% last year , and private consumption rose more than in any other Western country . <P> The relative prosperity is testimony to an economic turnaround . Only 17 months ago , France was beset by inflation ; it arose from the student-worker riots of 1968 , after which a 15% wage increase was necessary to restore tranquillity . The danger of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economy seemed so acute that Finance Minister Valry Giscard d'Estaing brought out every modern anti-inflationary weapon : a devaluation of the franc , tight credit controls , the highest interest rates in Europe , a temporary price freeze and a strict limit on wage increases . <P> Arms and the Exporter . The austerity measures were startlingly effective . Since devaluation , the franc has become one of Europe 's solidest currencies . The gross national product grew by 6.2% last year , to $126 billion , while prices rose only 5.2% . Leading companies threw their energies into exports , which increased 21% . Arms exports boomed . In 1970 , France sold $1.3 billion worth of military aircraft , submarines , helicopters and other equipment to 26 countries . France ranks second only to the U.S. , which expects to sell $1.9 billion worth of armaments abroad in the fiscal year ending June 30 . <P> By last month Giscard d'Estaing was able to announce that " the readjustment has ended . " The measures have worked quickly because France is a prosperous country with considerable powers of recovery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " France goes through events , through wars , through student riots , and these events can be very dangerous and disruptive . But as soon as the clouds fade away , we go back to normalcy . " <P> The recovery has been sped along by changes in the structure of industry . As Giscard d'Estaing put it , " We had an industry that was in the hands of an old establishment of bourgeois people , rather respectable , rather inefficient , reluctant to change . Since our entry into the Common Market , this has been entirely changed . The people are not the same ; the old ones have faded away , disappeared . "
