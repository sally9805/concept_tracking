txt Evidence accumulates that the Russian military are gaining increasing influence over Soviet policy . In recent weeks and months , Soviet military figures , especially Defense Minister Andrei A. Grechko , have intruded noticeably into Moscow 's diplomatic and political spheres . Henry A. Kissinger 's secret trip to Moscow offers one revealing example of the Soviet military 's current prominence . For two days Mr. Kissinger was secluded with Party Secretary Leonid I. Brezhnev and Foreign Minister Andrei A. Gromyko in Mr. Brezhnev 's country house nine miles from the capital . Then , although Mr. Kissinger had not ended his quite exceptional visit , Mr. Brezhnev left these discussions of " important international problems " and gave precedence to consultations with his top military brass . The commanders-in-chief and the chiefs of staff of all branches of the armed forces ? Army , Navy , Air Force , rocketry logistics , civilian defense ? the commanders of all military districts , and top political commissars attended this unprecedented consultation . The " Gensek , " as Soviets refer to the party 's secretary-general , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ readiness of the armed forces were given . . . and expressed the firm conviction that the military , as always , would successfully fulfill its task , " said the communique . - // *Soviet military influence // Mr. Brezhnev must have felt that it was imperative to win over the military to his policy of detente . This policy of d  --  tente is clearly reflected in the party press . " Our common course , the strengthening of peace " was the characteristic five-column headline of an article by the new Polish Foreign Minister Stefan Olshevski in Pravda of April 27 . But the military seems to play a different tune . Also on April 27 , Red Star , the daily of the armed forces , carried a two-column , front-page editorial devoted to the military consultation April 22 to 24 . It said that " the complicated international situation " on which Mr. Brezhnev had lectured the marshals and generals " requires from us the maintenance of our defense potential . . on the highest level . " Warnings sounded The editorial bristled with warnings of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The dark forces of world reaction seek a way out of the inextricable contradictions of capitalism by means of heightening international tension . . . military adventures and direct aggression . " " The desperate opposition of West German revanchists against a relaxation in Europe , the continaution of the criminal war of American imperialism against the peoples of Indo-China , and the Israeli aggressors " were singled out as examples . The editorial was scarcely in tune with strengthining of peace " And it may not have been fortuitious that this editorial apppeared on the day Egyptian President Anwar al-Sadat arrived in the Soviet capital . Internal opposition to Mr. Brezhnev 's policy has been reported from many sides . According to good sources the Politbureau is far from unanimous in its judgment of these policies . The military especially favor a harder line . judging by Red Star 's editorial , the " gensek " does not seem to have been overly successful so far in selling his policy to the armed forces . Meanwhile , it happens more and more frequently that Marshal Grechko or another military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who formerly asked to be received by a member of the Politbureau or of the inner cabinet now seek an audience with the Defense Minister who belongs to neither of these bodies .
