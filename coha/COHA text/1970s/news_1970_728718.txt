txt Fire House No. 9 , in Cleveland 's East Side ghetto , has all the earmarks of a police station . Squad cars are parked in the driveway . Armed policemen stand guard . They have been on duty since firemen were shot at a few weeks ago . Ghetto residents use other weapons against firemen more often than bullets . The other day stones rained down on No. 9 's hook and ladder rig from a bridge while firemen worked below to put out a blaze in a railroad car . Such persistent harassment , almost a daily occurrence here and in New York , Washington , Detroit and many other cities , has made recruiting of firemen more difficult and has left fire officials and the city authorities puzzled . Why , they ask , would anyone want to hurt a conscientious man who might be taking serious risks to save lives and protect property ? Several explanations are offered . Most firemen and fire Attacks on Firemen Hurt Recruiting in Many Cities very definitely hinders recruiting . " Mr. Davis tends to blame teen-agers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Cleveland firefighters union , said that the increase in false alarms had more than tripled the workload since 1961 . Firemen work up to 60 hours a week in some cities at relatively low pay ( only Chicago has reached $12,000 a year ) , and many must " moonlight " to pay their bills . " We were making 8.000 runs a year in 1961 , " Mr. Gannon said . " Last year it was 27,000 , with a smaller force . " Cleveland , with an authorized force of 1,500 firemen , now has 1,292 . Fifty new firemen were appointed in February . All were white . A third of the city is black , but only 4 per cent of the Fire Department is . Cleveland 's ratio is typical . Washington has the largest percentage of black firemen , onefifth of the force , but the city is 70 per cent black . Some Southern cities , such as Jackson , Miss. , have no black firemen .

Death and  --  injury at the hands of snipers has diminished with the reduction in ghetto rioting since 1968 , but false alarms Intended to lure firemen into stoning range have soared . " The false alarm rate is completely out of control , " said Capt . Charles A. Lewis , president of the Pittsburgh firefighters union . " More than 60 per cent of our runs are false . That 's when most harassment takes place . " Police Escort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to certain call boxes without a police escort , " said Donald O'Brien , general manager of the International Association of Fire Chiefs in New York . An examination of fire department troubles in several cities showed that false alarms were increasing in most of them . They have soared by 237 ler cent in the District of Coumbia in the last four years , for example , with 1,437 last month . " False alarms are a tremendous morale problem , " said Joseph H. Mattare , fire marshal for the-District . " They are heating our men to death and wearing down our equipment . " " The harassment is very disturbing , " said Safety Director Benjamin 0 . Davis Jr. , the topranking Negro general when he retired from the Air Force last Feb . I to head Cleveland 's poll ( P and fire dr  --  pdrtnients " R // chiefs feel that the " establishment , " with the uniform as one of its ' symbols , is under attack rather than individual firemen . Some attribute this to the influence of " revolutionaries " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trouble is in black ghettos , and American fire departments are overwhelmingly white . Black firemen frequently charge that there is bigotry within fire depatrments and that resentment in the ghettos is a bigger reason for attacks on firemen than opposition to a vague concept such as " the establishment . " White fire chiefs invariably concede that it would help to have more blacks in firemen 's uniforms . But officials point out , too , that black firemen have also been the target of stones , and that firemen sometimes encounter abuse on college campuses and in low-income white neighborhoods as well as in black slums . Whatever the reasons , the perils of the job have escalated swiftly in recent years . In Washington , firemen wear heavy leather neckpieces now as well as plastic face masks . Washington , Boston , New York , Newark and other cities have installed shields on trucks to ward off missiles . New trucks come with enclosed cabs . Plastic domes are provided for the rear tillerman . Many Incidents Cited Many fire chiefs say it would help to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the civil service exams . " It 's not our fault , " said Fire Chief Lawrence L. Kenney of Miami , whose 670 firefighters include two Negroes . " I do n't know why the members of minority groups have this hesitancy about joining the department , " said Fire Chief C. R. Cook of Houston . Black firefighters offer specific reasons , including these : discrimination , civil service tests " designed for whites , " recruiting of nonresidents of a city in competition with ghetto dwellers , and automatic elimination of men with token police records . " In the ghetto , " said Brother Diablo of the black United Community Center in Cleveland , " you can get a police record by just standing around . " " Blacks want to get in , " said Lieut . Donald Brown of the Philadelphia Fire Department . " But a ghetto education does not prepare those who would like to be firemen for the civil service exams . " Mr. Brown , a member of the board of directors of the allblack Club Valiants , Inc. , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the number of blacks in fire companies would reassure citizens in the ghettos that the system was not racist and that ax-wielding firemen intended no unnecessary damage to property . Preference for Negroes Black firemen contend that black residents should be given preference in a city over the many white firefighters who i live in suburbs . They believe examinations should be devised that do not favor applicants who can answer irrelevant questions about history or who have special knowledge of the fire department because they have friends or relatives in it . Irish and Italian and other white ethnic groups have traditionally monopolized fire department jobs , with fathers encouraging sons and nephews to join . The International Association of Fire Chiefs signed a contract , this month to do a one-year study for the Labor Department on hiring the disadvantaged and obstacles to it . The black fireThe blacks demanded better racial balance in fire stations , recruiting of Negroes and equal promotion practices . They charged many white firemen were bigoted . Separate Breathing Devices In August , 1968 , 100 black firemen in Washington filed charges with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separate breathing device for the rescue squad so whites would not have to put their mouths on the same machine . Beds were set aside in the station houses , they said , for , use only by blacks . This was the , practice in Baltimore , also , until city officials stopped it . Because firemen live and sleep in close proximity , there is more potential for racial friction than in a police department , but ? many firemen say close quarters pose few problems in fire houses after the first period of adjustment following integration . " A black firefighter can be pretty bitter riding on a piece of equipment covered with American flags he knows are racist symbols , " said David Jackson , president of the Vulcan Society , the black firemen 's organization in New York City . " They treat us okay in the fire house , but they ca n't figure out how we relate to the guy on welfare out on the street , " he said .
