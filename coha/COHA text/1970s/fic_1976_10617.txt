S T O R M W A R N I N GThe loss of the chickens and two goats kept for milk , all swept overboard in a bad squall three days out of Belem , has had an unfortunate effect on our diet , althoughhere again , it has been most noticeable in the nuns . Frau Prager is still my main worry , and her condition , as far as I may judge , continues to decline . As for the prospect of a meeting with an enemy ship , we are as ready in that respect as can reasonably be expected . The Deutschland is now the Gudrid Andersen to the last detail , including the library of Swedish books in my cabin . The plan of campaign , if boarded at any time , is simple . The additional men carried beyond normal crew requirementswill secrete themselves in the bilges . A simpledevice admittedly , and one easily discovered by any kind of a thorough search , but we have little choice in the matter . The Deutschland stands up well so far to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day passes that shrouds do not part or sails split and , this morning , Mister Sturmm reported twelve inches of water in the bilges . But , as yet , there is no cause for alarm . We all get old and the Deutschland is older than most ... . The whole ship lurched drunkenly and Berger was thrown from his chair as the cabin tilted . He scrambled to his feet , got the door open , and ran out on deck . The Deutschland was plunging forward through heavy seas , the deck awash with spray . Lieutenant Sturmm and Leading Seaman Kluth had the wheel between them and it was taking all their strength to hold it . High above the deck , the main gaff topsail fluttered free in the wind . The noise was tremendous and could be heard even above the roaring of the wind , and the topmast was whipping backward and forward . A matter of moments only before it snapped . But already Richter was at the rail , S T O R M W A R N I N G @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ downhaul to collapse the sail . Berger ran to join him , losing his footing and rolling into the scuppers as another great sea floated in across the deck , but somehow he was on his feet and lending his weight to the downhaul with Richter . The sail came down , the Deutschland righted herself perceptibly , the continual drumming ceased . Richter shouted , " I 'd better get up there and see to a new out-haul . " Berger cried above the wind , " You would n't last five minutes out there on that gaff in this weather . It 'll have to wait till the wind eases . " " But that sail will tear herself to pieces , sir . " " A gasket should hold her for the time being . I 'll see toit . Berger sprang into the ratlines and started to climb , aware of the wind tearing at his body like some living thing . When he paused fifty feet up and glanced down , Richter was right behind him . There was a foot of water in the saloon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sister Angela went from cabin to cabin , doing her best to calm her alarmed companions . When she went into the Pragers , she found the old man on his knees at his wife 's bunk . Frau Prager was deathly pale , eyes closed , little sign of life there at all . " What is it ? " Otto Prager demanded in alarm . She ignored him for the moment and took his wife 's pulse . It was still there , however irregular . Prager tugged at her sleeve . " What happened ? " " I 'll find out , " she said calmly . " You stay with your wife . " She went out on deck to find the Deutschland racing42 STORM WARNINGnorth , every fore and aft sail drawing well , yards braced as she plunged into the waves . Sturmm and Kluth were still at the wheel . The young lieutenant called to her , but his words were snatched away by the wind . She made it to the mizzen shrouds on the port side , the wind tearing at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ballooning sails . The sky was a uniform gray , the whole world alive with the sound of the ship , a thousand creaks and groans . And then , a hundred feet up , she saw Berger and Richter swaying backward and forward on the end of the gaff as they secured the sail . It was perhaps the most incredible thing she had ever seen in her life and she was seized by a tremendous feeling of exhilaration . A sea slopped in over the rail in a green curtain that bowled her over , sending her skidding across the deck on her hands and knees . She crouched against the bulwark and , as she tried to get up , Berger dropped out of the shrouds beside her and got a hand under her arm . " Bloody fool ! " he shouted . " Why ca n't you stay below ? " He ran her across the deck and into his cabin before she had a chance to reply . Sister Angela collapsed into the chair behind the desk and Berger got the door shut and leaned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to do with you ? " " I 'm sorry , " she said . " There was panic down below . I simply wanted to know what had happened . " He picked up a towel from his bunk and tossed it across to her . " A line parted , a sail broke free . It could have snapped the topmast like a matchstick , only Richter was too quick for it . " He opened a cupboard and reached for the bottle . " A drink , Sister ? Purely medicinal , of course . Rum is all I can offer , I 'm afraid . " " I do n't think so . " Berger poured himself a large one and she wiped her face and regarded him curiously . " It wasS T O R M W A R N I N G 43incredible what you were doing out there . You and Mister Richter , so high up and in such weather . " " Not really , " he said indifferently . " Not to anyone who 's reefed main t'gallants on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She nodded slowly . " Tell me , do you still think we 're bad luck ? A positive guarantee of contrary winds , was n't that what you said at our first meeting ? And yet we 've made good progress , would n't you agree ? " " Oh , we 're making time all right , " Berger admitted . " Althoughshe shakes herself to pieces around us just a little bit more each day . " " You speak of her , the Deutschland , as if she is a living thing . As if she has an existence of her own . " " I would n't quarrel with that . Although I suppose your church would . A ship does n't have one voice , she has many . You can hear them calling to each other out there , especially at night . " " The wind in the rigging ? " There was something close to mockery in her voice . " There are other possibilities . Old-timers will tell you that the ghost of anyone killed falling from the rigging remains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Obligatory in the Kriegsmarine . " There was an ironic smile on his face now . " Imagine the shades who infest this old girl . Next time something brushes past you in the dark on the companionway , you 'll know what it is . One Our Fatherand two Hail Marys should keep you safe . " Her cheeks flushed , but before she could reply , the door was flung open and Sister Else appeared . " Please , Sister , come quickly . Frau Prager seems to be worse . " Sister Angela jumped to her feet and moved out . Berger closed the door behind her , then picked up the towel she dropped and wiped his face . Strange how she seemed to bring out the worst in him . A constant source of irritation , 44 S T O R M W A R N I N G but then perhaps it was simply that they 'd all been to- gether for too long in such a confined space . And yet ... For most of the afternoon , HMS Guardian , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fleet , en route to Trinidad for special orders , had proceeded submerged , but at 1600 hours she surfaced . It was the throb of the diesels that brought her captain , Lieutenant Commander George Harvey , awake . He lay there for a moment on the bunk , staring up at the steel bulkhead , aware of the taste in his mouth , the smell of sub- marine , and then the green curtain was pulled aside and Petty Officer Swallow came in with tea in a chipped en- amel mug . " Just surfaced , sir . " The tea was foul , but at least there was real sugar in it , which was something . " What 's it like up there ? " " Overcast . Wind northwest . Two to three . Visibility poor , sir . Slight sea mist and drizzling . " " Succinct as always , coxswain , " Harvey told him . " Beg pardon , sir ? " " Never mind . Just tell Mr. Edge I 'll join him on the bridge in five minutes . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the floor and sat there , yawning . Then he moved to the small desk bolted to the bulkhead , opened the Guardian 's war diary , and in cold , precise naval language started to insert the daily entry . There were three men on the bridge . Sublieutenant Edge , who was officer of the watch , a signalman , and an able sea- man for lookout . The sea was surprisingly calm and there was none of the usual corkscrewing or pitching that a sub- marine frequently experiences when traveling on the sur- face in any kind of rough weather . Edge was thoroughly enjoying himself . The rain in his face was quite refreshing , and the salt air felt sweet and clean in his lungs after the hours spent below . Swallow came up the ladder , a mug of tea in one hand . " Thought you might like a wet , sir . Captain 's compliments and he 'll join you on the bridge in five minutes . " " Good show , " Edge said cheerfully . " Not that there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then his eyes widened and an expression of incredulity appeared on his face . " Good God Almighty ! " he said . " I do n't believe it . " In the same instant , the lookout cried out , pointing , and Edge turned to see a three-masted barkentine , all sails set , emerge from a fogbank a quarter of a mile to port . On board the Deutschland there was no panic , for the plan to be followed in such an eventuality had been gone over so many times that everyone knew exactly what to do . Berger was on the quarterdeck , Sturmm and Richter beside him at the rail . The bosun was holding a signaling lamp . The captain spoke without lowering his glasses . " A British submarine . T ' class . " " Is this it , sir ? " Sturmm asked . " Are we finished ? " " Perhaps . " The Guardian 's gun crew poured out of her conning tower and manned their positions . For a moment , there was considerable activity , then a signal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' " Richter translated . " Plain enough . Reply : As a neutral ship I comply under protest . ' " The shutter on the signal lamp in the bosun 's hands clattered . A moment later , the reply came : " I intend to board you . Stand by . " Berger lowered his glasses . " Very well , gentlemen . Actionstations , if you please . Take in all sail , Mister Sturmm . You , Richter , will see the rest of the crew into the bilges and I will attend to the passengers . " 46 S T O R M W A R N I N GThere was a flurry of activity as Sturmm turned to bark orders to the watch on deck . Richter went down the quarterdeckladder quickly . Berger followed him , descending the companionway . When he entered the saloon , four of the nuns were seated around the table listening to a Bible reading from Sister Lotte . " Where is Sister Angela ? " Berger demanded . Sister Lotte paused . " With Frau Prager . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emerged . He seemed haggard and drawn , and had lost weight since that first night in Belem , so that his tropical linen suit seemed a size too large . " How are things ? " Berger asked . " Bad , " Prager said . " She gets weaker by the hour . " " I 'm sorry . " Berger addressed his next remark to all of them . " There 's a British submarine on the surface about a quarter of a mile off our port beam and moving in . They intend to board . " Sister Kathe crossed herself quickly and Sister Angela came out of Prager 's cabin clutching an enamel bucket , her white apron soiled . When Berger next spoke , it was to no one but her . " You heard ? " " Yes . " " We had a bad night of it , Sister  --  a hell of a night . You understand me ? " " Perfectly , Kapitan . " Her face was pale , but the eyes sparkled . " We wo n't let you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the bulkhead , reached up , and jabbed at the skylight again and again , glass showering across the table so that the nuns scattered with cries of alarm . He tossed the broom into a corner . " See that you do n't , " he said and went back up the companionway . There was total silence , the nuns staring at Sister Angela expectantly . With a violent gesture she raised the bucket inS T O R M W A R N I N G 47her hands and emptied the contents across the floor . There was the immediate all-pervading stench of vomit and Sister Brigitte turned away , stomach heaving . " Excellent , " Sister Angela said . " Now you , Lotte , go to the lavatory and fetch a bucket of slops . I want conditions down here to be so revolting those Tommies will be back up that companionway in two minutes flat . " She had changed completely , the voice clipped , incisive , totally in command . " As for the rest of you , complete disorderin the cabins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at her sleeve . " What about me , Sister ? What shall I do ? " " Kneel , Herr Prager , " she said . " At your wife 's bedside  --  and pray . " As the Guardian moved in , Harvey observed the activity on the deck of the Deutschland closely through his glasses . Edge came up the ladder behind him . " I 've checked Lloyd 's Register , sir . It seems to be her all right . Gudrid Andersen , three-masted barkentine , registered Goteborg . " " But what in the hell is she doing here ? " Harvey frowned , trying to work out the best way of handling the situation . His first officer , Gregson , lay in his bunk with a fractured left ankle . In such circumstances to leave the Guardian himself , however temporarily , was unthinkable . Which left Edge , a nineteen-year-old boy on his first operational patrol  --  hardly an ideal choice . On the other hand , there was Swallow . His eyes met the chief petty officer 's briefly . Not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read his thoughts perfectly . " Tell me , Coxswain , does anyone on board speak Swedish ? " " Not to my knowledge , sir . " " We must hope they run to enough English over there to get us by , then . Lieutenant Edge will lead the boarding party . Pick him two good men  --  sidearms only . And I think you might as well go along for the ride . " 4$ STORM WARNING " Sir . " Swallow turned , and at his shouted command , the forwardhatch was opened and a rubber dinghy broken out . Edge went below and reappeared a few moments later buckling a webbing belt around his waist , from which hung a holstered Webley revolver . He was excited and showed it . " Think you can handle it ? " Harvey asked . " I believe so , sir . " " Good . A thorough inspection of ship 's papers and identitydocuments of everyone on board . " " Am I looking for anything special , sir ? " " Hardly , " Harvey said dryly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a surface raider in 1917 , if I remember my naval history correctly , and times have changed . No , we 're entitled to check her credentials , and I 'm consumed with curiosity as to the nature of her business , so off you go . " Sturmm waited at the rail as the dinghy coasted in . Edge went up the Jacob 's ladder first , followed by one of the ratingsand Swallow , who carried a Thompson gun . The other rating stayed with the dinghy . Of Berger , there was no sign . Sturmm , who spoke excellent English , pointed to the ensign , which fluttered at the masthead . " I must protest , sir . As you can see , this is a Swedish vessel . " " Ah , good , you speak English , " Edge said with a certain relief . " Lieutenant Philip Edge of his Brittanic Majesty 's submarine Guardian . Are you the master of this vessel ? " " No , my name is Larsen . First mate . Captain Nillsen is in his cabin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm afraid things are in a bit of a mess . We had a bad night of it . Almostturned turtle when a squall hit us during the middle watch . It caused considerable damage . " Edge said to Swallow , " You handle things here , Coxswain , while I have a word with the captain . " " Shall we take a look below , sir ? " Swallow suggested . Edge turned , taking in the watchful gun crew on theSTORM WARNING 49Guardian , and the Browning machine gun that had been mounted on the rail beside Harvey . " Yes , why not ? " he said and followed Sturmm toward the quarterdeck . The young German opened the door to the captain 's cabin and stood politely to one side . Edge paused on the threshold , taking in the shambles before him . A porthole was smashed , the carpet soaked , the whole place littered with books and personal belongings . Berger stood behind the desk , face stern , the ship 's log and other papers ready on the desk before him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English , so I 'll have to interpret for you . " Which was far from the truth , for Berger 's English , though modest , was adequate . " The captain , " Sturmm added , " is not pleased at this forcible boarding of a neutral vessel about her lawful business . " " I 'm sorry , " Edge said , considerably intimidated by the stern expression on Berger 's face , " but I 'm afraid I must insist on seeing your ship 's papers and log , also your cargo manifest . " Berger turned away as if angry . Sturmm said , " But we carry no cargo , Lieutenant , only passengers . " He picked up the ship 's log , soaked in seawater , its pages sticking together . " Perhaps you would care to examine the log ? You will find all other relevant papers here also . " Edge took it from him , sat down in Berger 's chair , and tried to separate the first two water-soaked pages , which promptly tore away in his hands . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members of the crew secreted in the bilges with him , were lying in several inches of stinking water , aware of Swallow 's heavy footsteps in the hold above their heads . Edge left the cabin fifteen minutes later , having examined as thoroughly as he could an assortment of papers , and clutching the Swedish passports offered for his inspection. 50 S T O R M W A R N I N GSwallow emerged from the companionway looking ill . Edge said , " Are the passengers down there , Coxswain ? " " Yes , sir . " Swallow was taking in deep breaths of salt air rapidly . " Five nuns , sir , and an old gentleman and his wife  --  and she does n't look too healthy . " Edge advanced to the top of the companionway and Swallow said hastily , " I would n't bother , sir . Not unless you feel you have to . They 've obviously had a rotten time of it in last night 's storm . Still cleaning up . " Edge hesitated , turned to glance at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The stink was appalling , the stench of human excrement and vomit turning his stomach . The first thing he saw in the shambles of the saloon below was four nuns on their knees in the filth with buckets and brushes , scrubbing the floor . Edge got a handkerchief to his mouth as Sister Angelaappeared in the doorway of the Pragers ' cabin . " Can I help you ? " she asked in good English . " Sorry to trouble you , ma'am . My duty  --  you understand ? " He held out the passports . " International law in time of war . I 'm entitled to inspect the passenger list . " He glanced past her at Prager , who knelt beside his wife . Her face was deathly pale , shining with sweat , and she was breathing incredibly slowly . " And this lady and gentleman ? " He started to sort through the passports . " Mr. Ternstrom and his wife . As you can see , she is very ill . " Prager turned to look at him , the agony on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back . Lotte chose that exact moment to be sick , crouching there on the floor like some animal . It was enough . Edge turned hastily , brushed past Sturmm , and went back up the companionway . He leaned on the starboard rail , breathing deeply , and Swallow moved beside him . " You all right , sir ? " S T O R M W A R N I N G 51 " God , what a pesthole . Those women  --  they 've been through hell . " He pulled himself together . " You 've checked the holds thoroughly , Coxswain ? " " Clean as a whistle , sir . She 's in ballast with sand . " Edge turned to Sturmm who stood waiting , Berger a pace or two behind . " I do n't understand . " " For many months we work the coastal trade in Brazil , " Sturmm told him . " Then we decide to come home . As you may imagine , no one seemed anxious to risk a cargo with us . " And the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Brazil for more than a year now . We are the first Swedish ship to leave Brazil during that time . They were grateful for the opportunity for any kind of passage . " " But the old lady , " Edge said , " Mrs. Ternstrom . She looks in a bad way . " " And anxious to see her family again while there is still time . " Sturmm smiled bitterly . " There 's a war on , or had n't you noticed ? It makes things difficult for us neutrals when we want to travel from one place to another . " Edge made his decision and handed the passports back . " You 'll want these . My apologies to your captain . I 'll have to confirm it with my commanding officer , but I see no reason why you should n't be allowed to proceed . " He moved to the head of the Jacob 's ladder and paused . " Those ladies down there ... " " Will be fine , Lieutenant . We 'll soon have things shipshapeagain . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiled . " Bring us up to date on the war , if you would . How are things going ? " " All our way now , no doubt about that , " Edge said . " Though they do seem to be slowing down rather in Europe . I do n't think we 're going to see Berlin by Christmasafter all . The Germans are making one hell of a fight of it in the low countries . " 52 S T O R M W A R N I N GHe went down the ladder quickly followed by Swallow and the other rating and they cast off . " Well , Coxswain ? ' he asked as they pulled away . " I know one thing , sir . I 'll never complain about serving in submarines again . " On the quarterdeck , Berger smoked a cigar and waited , Sturmm at his side . " What do you think , Herr Kapitan ? " Sturmm asked . " Has it worked ? " At the same moment , the signal lamp on the bridge of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' " Berger spelled out . " Happy voyageand good luck . ' " He turned to Sturmm , his face calm . " My maternal grandmother was English , did I ever tell you that ? " " No , sir . " Berger tossed his cigar over the side . " She 's all yours , Mister Sturmm . Let 's get under way again as soon as pos-sible . " " Aye , aye , sir . " Sturmm turned , raising his voice to call to the men below , and Berger descended to the deck . He stood in the entrance to the companionway , aware of the stench , of Sister Angela 's pale face peering up at him . " Did it work ? " she called softly . " Remind me , when I have the time , to tell you what a very remarkable woman you are , Sister . " " At the appropriate moment , I shall , Kapitan . You may be certain of that , " she said serenely . Berger turned away . The Guardian was already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind him Helmut Richter emerged from the forward hatch and came aft . His body was streaked with filth , but he was smiling . S T O R M W A R N I N G 53 " Can the lads come on deck and wash off under the pump ? They smell pretty high after those bilges . " " So I observe . " Berger wrinkled his nose . " Give it anothertwenty minutes until our British friends are really on their way , Helmut , then turn them loose . " He went into his cabin and Richter stripped his shirt from his body , worked the deck pump with one hand , and turned the hose on himself . As he did so , Sister Lotte came out on deck clutching a full pail of slops in both hands . She got as far as the starboard rail and was about to empty it when Richter reached her . " Never into the wind , " he said . " That way you get the contents back in your face . " He peered down in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without . " He carried the pail to the port rail , emptied it over the side , then flushed it out under the pump . She stood watching him calmly . She was small and very slightly built , a lawyer 's daughter from Munich who looked younger than her twenty-three years . Unlike the other nuns , she was still a novice , and had been transferred to Brazil , by way of Portugal , the previousyear only because she was a trained nurse and there was a shortage of people with her qualifications . She picked up his shirt . " I 'll wash this for you . " " No need . " " And the seam is splitting on one shoulder . I 'll mend it . " When she looked up , he saw that her eyes were a startling cornflower blue . " It must have been horrible down there . " " For you also . " He handed her the pail , she took it , and for a brief moment they held it together . Sister Angela said quietly , " Lotte , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entrance to the companionway , her face calm as always , but there was a new wariness in her eyes when she looked at Richter . The girl smiled briefly54 STORM WARNINGand joined her and they went below . Richter started to pump water over his head vigorously . Berger sat behind the desk , surveying the wreckage of his cabin  --  not that it mattered . It could soon be put straight again . He was filled with a tremendous sense of elation and opened his personal journal . He picked up his pen , thought for a moment , then wrote : I am now more than ever convinced that we shall reach Kiel in safety ... Barkentine Deutschland , 14 September 1944 . Lat. 28  --  16'N , long . 30  --  5o'W . Frau Prager died at three bells of the midwatch . We delivered her body to the sea shortly after dawn , Sister Angela taking the service . Ship 's company much affected by this calamitous event . A light breeze sprang up during the afternoon watch , increasingto fresh in squalls . I estimate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day . Fouright was falling fast as Jago and Petty Officer Jansenwent up the hill to St. Mungo 's . They found the burial party in the cemetery at the back of the church . There were twenty or so islanders there , men and women , Jean Sinclair and Reeve standing together , the admiral in full uniform . Murdoch Macleod , in his best blue serge suit , stood at the head of the open grave , a prayer book in his hands . The two Americans paused some little distance away56 STORM WARNINGand removed their caps . It was very quiet except for the incessantcalling of the birds , and Jago looked down across Mary 's Town to the horseshoe of the harbor where the MGB was tied up at the jetty . The sun was setting in a sky the color of brass , splashed with scarlet , thin mackerel clouds high above . Beyond Barra Head , the islands marched north to Barra , Mingulay , Pabbay , Sandray , rearing out of a perfectly calm sea , black against flame . Reeve glanced over his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward the men through the gravestones . " Thanks for coming so promptly , Lieutenant . " " No trouble , sir . We were on our way to Mallaig from Stornoway when they relayed your message . " Jago nodded toward the grave into which half a dozen fishermen were lowering the coffin . " Another one from U-743 ? " Reeve nodded . " That makes eight in the past three days . " He hesitated . " When you were last here you said you were going to London on leave this week . " " That 's right , Admiral . If I can get to Mallaig on time I intend to catch the night train for Glasgow . Is there something I can do for you , sir ? " " There certainly is . " Reeve took a couple of envelopes from his pocket . " This first one is for my niece . Her apartment'sin Westminster , not far from the Houses of Parlia-ment . " " And the other , sir ?

They 'll brief you at Mallaig on the times during the day I sit at the damned thing hoping someone will take no-tice . " Jago saluted , nodded to Jansen , and then moved away . As the admiral rejoined the funeral party , Murdoch Macleodstarted to read aloud in a firm , clear voice , " . . . man that is born of woman bath but a short time to live , and is full of misery . He cometh up and is cut down like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with only the burned-out fire of day on the horizon as they went out through the lychgate . Jansen said , " Who 's the letter for , Lieutenant ? " " General Eisenhower , " Jago said simply . In Brest , they were shooting again across the river as Paul Gericke turned the corner , the rattle of small-arms fire drifting across the water . Somewhere on the far horizon rockets arched through the night , and in spite of the heavy rain considerable portions of the city appeared to be on fire . Most of the warehouses that had once lined the street had been demolished by bombing , the pavement was littered with rubble and broken glass , but the small hotel on the corner that served as naval headquarters still seemed to be intact . Gericke ran up the steps quickly , showed his pass to the sentry at the door , and went inside . He was a small man , no more than five feet five or six , with fair hair and a pale face that seemed untouched by wind and weather . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all , contrasting strangely with the good-humored , rather lazy smile that seemed to permanently touch his mouth . His white-topped naval cap had seen much service and he was hardly a prepossessing figure in his old leather jerkin , leather trousers , and seaboots . But the young lieutenantsitting at his desk in the foyer saw only the Knight's58 STORM WARNINGCross , with Oak Leaves for a second award , at the throat and was on his feet in an instant . " I was asked to report to the commodore of submarines as soon as I arrive , " Gericke told him . " Korvettenkapitan Gericke . U-235 . " " He 's expecting you , sir , " the lieutenant said . " If you 'd follow me . " They went up the curving staircase . A petty officer , a pistolat his belt , stood guard outside one of the hotel bedrooms . The handwritten notice on the door said KAPITANZUR SEE OTTO FRIEMEL , FUHRER DER UNTERSEE-BOOT WEST . The lieutenant knocked and went in . " Korvettenkapitan Gericke , sir . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ readinglamp on Friemel 's desk . He was in shirt-sleeves , working his way through a pile of correspondence , steel-rimmed reading glasses perched on the end of his nose , and an ivory cigarette holder jutting from the left corner of his mouth . He came around the desk smiling , hand outstretched . " My dear Paul . Good to see you . How was the West Indies ? " " A long haul , " Gericke said . " Especially when it was time to come home . " Friemel produced a bottle of schnapps and two glasses . " We 're out of champagne . Not like the old days . " " What , no flowers on the dock ? " Gericke said . " Do n't tell me we 're losing the war ? " " My dear Paul , in Brest we do n't even have a dock any longer .

These days they send out half-trained boys . You 're one of the few old-timers left . " Gericke helped himself to a cigarette from a box on the table . It was French and of the cheapest variety , for when he lit it and inhaled , the smoke bit at the back of his throat , sending him into a paroxysm of coughing . " My God ! Now I know things are bad .

" Of course , they were pulled out of the Ukraine to come here . It could be they are still euphoric at such good fortune . An Americanprison camp , after all , is infinitely to be preferred to the Russian variety . " " And what 's the U-boat position ? " " There is n't one . The Ninth Flotilla is no more . U-256 was the last to leave . That was eleven days ago . Orders are to regroup in Bergen . " " Then what about me ? " Gericke asked . " I could have made for Norway by way of the Irish Sea and the North Channel . " " Your orders , Paul , are quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Channel as the rest of the flotilla has done , only in your case someone at High Command has provided you with what one might term a slight de-tour . " Gericke , who had long since passed being surprised at anything , smiled . " Where to , exactly ? " " It 's really quite simple . " Friemel turned to the table6o S T O R M W A R N I N G I S T O R M W A R N I N G 61behind , rummaged among a pile of charts , found the one he was looking for , and opened it across the desk . Gericke leaned over . " Falmouth ? " " That 's right . The Royal Navy 's Fifteenth MGB Flotilla operating out of Falmouth has been causing havoc on this entire coast recently . To be perfectly honest , it 's made any kind of naval activity impossible . " " And what am I supposed to do about it ? " " According to your orders , go into Falmouth and lay mines . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up a typed order . " Donitz himself . " Gericke laughed out loud . " But this is really beautiful , Otto . Quite superb in its idiocy , even for those chair-bound bastards in Kiel . What on earth am I supposed to do , win the war in a single bold stroke ? " He shook his head . " They must believe in fairy stories . Someone should tell them that when the tailor boasted he could kill seven at one blow he meant flies on a slice of bread and jam . " " I do n't know , " Friemel said . " It could be worse . There 's a protecting curtain of mines plus a blockship here between Pendennis Point and Blackrock and a temporary net boom from Blackrock to St. Anthony Head . That 's supposed to be highly secret , by the way , but it seems the Abwehr still have an agent operational in the Falmoutharea . " " He must feel lonely . " " Ships in and out all the time . Go in with a few when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Carrick Roads and across the inner harbor and out again . " Gericke shook his head . " I 'm afraid not . " " Why ? " " We may get in , but we certainly wo n't get out . " Friemel sighed . " A pity , as I 'll be going with you . Not out of any sense of adventure , I assure you . I have orders to report to Kiel , and as the land routes to Germany are cut , my only way would seem to be with you to Bergen . " Gericke shrugged . " So , in the end , all roads lead to hell . " Friemel helped himself to one of the French cigarettes and inserted it in his holder . " What shape are you in ? " " We were strafed by a Liberator in Biscay . Superficial damage only , but my engines need a complete overhaul . New bearings for a start . " " Not possible . I can give you four or five days . We must leave on the nineteenth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week at the most . No more . " The door opened and the young lieutenant entered . " Signal from Kiel , sir . Marked most urgent . " Friemel took the flimsy from him and adjusted his spectacles . A slight , ironic smile touched his mouth . " Would you believe it , Paul , but this confirms my promotion as Konteradmiral in command of all naval forces in the Brest area . One can only imagine it has been delayed in chan-nels . " The lieutenant passed across another flimsy . Friemel read it , his face grave , then handed it to Gericke . It said : CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR PROMOTION IN THE FULL AND CERTAIN KNOWLEDGE THAT YOU AND YOUR MEN WILL DIE RATHER THAN YIELD ONE INCH OF SOIL TO THE ENEMY . ADOLF HITLER . Gericke passed it back . " Congratulations , Herr Konteradmiral , " he said formally . Without a flicker of emotion , Friemel said to the lieutenant , " Send this message to Berlin . Will fight to the last . Long live the Fiihrer . ' That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Friemel said , " You ap-prove ? " " Was n't that Liitjens 's last message before the Bismarck went down ? " " Exactly , " Rear Admiral Otto Friemel said . " Another drink , my friend ? " He reached for the bottle , then sighed . " What a pity . We appear to have finished the last of the schnapps . " 62 S T O R M W A R N I N G It was still raining heavily in London at eight-thirty on the following evening when JU 88 pathfinders of Grupe i/K.G.66 , operating out of Chartres and Rennes in France , made their first strike . By nine-fifteen , the casualty department of Guy 's Hospital was working at full stretch . Janet Munro , in the end cubicle , curtain drawn , care- fully inserted twenty-seven stitches into the right thigh of a young auxiliary fireman . He seemed dazed and lay there , staring blankly at the ceiling , an unlit cigarette hanging from the corner of his mouth . Janet was being assisted by a male nurse named @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had served on the western front as a medical corps sergeant in the First World War . He strongly approved of the young American doctor in every possible way , and made it his business to look out for her welfare , something she seemed quite incapable of doing for herself . Just now he was partic- ularly concerned about the fact that she had been on duty for twelve hours , and it was beginning to show . " You going off after this one , miss ? " " How can I , Joey ? " she said . " They 'll be coming in all night . " Bombs had been falling for some time on the other side of the Thames but now there was an explosion close at hand . The whole building shook and there was a crash of breaking glass . The lights dimmed for a moment and some- where a child started to wail . " My God , Jerry certainly picks his time , " Callaghan re- marked . " What do you mean ? " she said , still concentrating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Do n't you know who 's here to- night , miss ? Eisenhower himself . Turned up an hour ago just before the bombing started . " She paused and looked at him blankly . " General Eisen- hower ? Here ? " " Visiting those Yank paratroopers in ward seventy-three . STORM WARNING 63The lads they brought over from Paris last week . Decoratingsome of them , that 's what I heard . " She was unable to take it in , suddenly very tired . She turned back to her patient and inserted the last couple of stitches . " I 'll dress it for you , " Callaghan said . " You get yourself a cup of tea . " As she stripped the rubber gloves from her fingers , the young fireman turned his head and looked at her . " You a Yank then , Doctor ? " " That 's right . " " Got any gum , chum ? " She smiled and took a cigarette lighter from her pocket . " No , but I can manage a light . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and gave it back to him . " You 'll be fine now . " He grinned . " Can you cook as well , Doc ? " " When I get the time . " Suddenly , the effort of keeping her smile in place was too much and she turned and went into the corridor quickly . Callaghan was right . She needed that cup of tea very badly indeed . And about fifteen hours ' sleep to follow  --  but that , of course , was quite impossible . As she started along the corridor , the curtain of a cubicle was snatched back and a young nurse emerged . She was obviouslypanic-stricken , blood on her hands . Turning wildly she saw Janet and called out  --  soundlessly , because at that moment another heavy bomb fell close enough to shake the walls and bring plaster from the ceiling . Janet caught her by the shoulders . " What is it ? " The girl tried to speak , pointing wildly at the cubicle as another bomb fell , and Janet pushed her to one side and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table , covered with a sheet , was obviously very much in labor . The young man who leaned over her was a corporal in the commandos , his uniform torn and streaked with dust. 64 STORM WARNING " Who are you ? " The tiredness had left her now , as if it had never been . " Her husband , miss . She 's having a baby . " He plucked at her sleeve . " For God 's sake do something . " Janet pulled back the sheet . " When did she start ? " " Half an hour , maybe longer . We was in the High Street when the siren went , so I took her into the underground . Borough Station . When she started feeling bad I thought I 'd better get her to hospital , but it was hell out there . Bombs falling all over the place . " Another landed very close to the hospital now , followed by a second . For a moment , the lights went out . The woman on the table cried out in fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lights came on again and she tried to sit up . Janet pushed her down and turned to the young nurse . " You know what 's wrong here ? " " I 'm not sure , " the girl said . " I 'm only a probationer . " She looked at her hands . " There was a lot of blood . " The young commando pulled at Janet 's sleeve . " What 's going on ? What 's up ? " " A baby is usually delivered head first , " Janet said calmly . " This is what 's known as a breech . That means it 's presenting its backside . " " Can you handle it ? " " I should imagine so , but we have n't got much time . I want you to stand over your wife , hold her hand , and talk to her . Anything you like , only do n't stop . " " Shall I get Sister Johnson ? " the young nurse asked . " No time , " Janet said . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and from the sound of it , panic had broken out among the crowd that waited in general casualty for treatment . She took a deep breath , tried to ignore that nightmare world outside , and concentrated on the task in hand . The first problem was to deliver the legs . She probed gently inside until she managed to get a finger up againstS T O R M W A R N I N G 65the back of one of the child 's knees . The leg flexed instantlyand so did the other when she repeated the performance . The woman cried out and Janet said to the husband , " Tell her to push . Push hard . " A moment later , the legs delivered themselves . She held out her hands for the young nurse to wipe away the blood , then grasped the legs , fingers beneath the thighs , and pulled down firmly until the shoulders were in sight . Now the arms were extended . She twisted the child to the left until the shoulder flexed , hooked a finger under the elbow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but farther away now , as she repeated the performance with the right . There was a tremendous hubbub outside , people runningup and down the corridor , and a smell of burning . She whispered to the young nurse , " So far so good . Now for the head . " She put her right arm beneath the child and got her forefinger into its mouth , then probed with her left hand for a grip on the shoulders and started to pull . Slowly , very slowly , it moved , and yet the strength required was so considerablethat sweat sprung to her forehead . And then it was clear and safe in her hands . But it was obvious at once that it was n't breathing and the whole body was deep purple . " Cotton wool , quickly ! " The young nurse passed some across and Janet cleared the mouth and nostrils . " Now you can get Sister Johnson , if she 's available , or Callaghan . Anybody , only hurry . " The girl went out on the run and Janet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shuddered , gave an audible gasp , and started to cry . Janet looked up and found the young commando staring at her wildly . " A daughter , " she said . " If you 're inter-ested . " His wife gave a stifled moan and fainted . At the same66 STORM WARNINGmoment the curtain was jerked back and Sister Johnson rushed in . Janet handed her the baby . " This one 's yours , Sister , " she said . " I 'll see to the mother . " And she elbowed the young commando out of the way and leaned over his wife . It was later , when the bombing had stopped and she had moved out onto the porch to smoke a cigarette , that the tiredness hit her again . " Oh , God , " she said softly . " Is n't it ever going to end , this war ? " There were fires on the other side of the Thames toward ' Westminster and the acrid smell of smoke filled the air . Behind her the blackout curtain opened briefly and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with him . " Oh , there you are , Doctor , " Callaghan said . " Been looking all over for you . This gentleman would like a word with you . " " Colonel Brisingham , ma'am . " He saluted punctiliously . Callaghan withdrew , leaving them alone on the dimly lit porch . " What can I do for you , Colonel ? " Janet asked . " General Eisenhower would appreciate a word , ma'am , if you could spare him a few minutes of your time . " He delivered the words gravely and courteously and yet , for Janet , the walls of the porch seemed to move in and out again , very slowly . She fell against the colonel who caught hold of her arms . " Are you all right ? " " It 's been a long day . " She took a deep breath . " Where is the general ? " " Just across the yard , ma'am , in his staff car . If you 'd follow me . We have n't much time , I 'm afraid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning . " The car was parked in a corner by the main gate . She was aware of the jeeps surrounding it , the helmets of the military police , then Brisingham had the rear door open . S T O R M W A R N I N G 67 " Dr. Munro , General . " Janet hesitated , then climbed inside , and Brisingham closed the door . In the faint light from the dashboard she could only get the briefest impression . He was wearing a trench coat , a forage cap , she could see that , but not much of his face except for the brief gleam of teeth that went with the inimitable smile . " Would it surprise you if I said I felt as if I already knew you ? " Eisenhower said . She frowned and then saw the solution . " Uncle Carey ? " He chuckled . " You were all he used to talk about over the coffee at SHAEF when we were putting Overlord together . But I knew him from long before then . Panama-1922 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as I recall , was a lieutenantcommander with a reputation for being difficult to handle . " " He has n't changed . " " Not in the slightest . " He hesitated .

" ' I know . Tell me . This place Fhada ? This Scottish islandhe 's staying on at the moment ? What 's he doing there ? " " His father 's family came from there originally . He was left a cottage by a cousin just before the war . He wanted somewhere to hide for a while and I suppose it seemed as good as any . It 's a strange place . " " You think he was looking for something ? " " Perhaps . " The general nodded . " Did you know he 's been trying to get back into action ? " " No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either . He could n't change his nature this late in the day , but it just is n't possible , you must see that . One68 STORM WARNINGeye , an apology for an arm . He 's given as much as any man could .... " " Except his life . " " Damn it ! " Eisenhower said . " The Navy Department wo n't budge . They want him on the retired list now . " " And you ? " He sighed heavily . " He sent me a letter by hand , delivered by some young naval officer on leave . Lucky I happened to be in London today . " " He asked for your help ? Carey Reeve ? " She smiled . " Now that , General , is really something . " " The same thought had occurred to me , " Eisenhower said . " And can you help ? " " I 've a job in Paris for him , starting the first of October . Supply and personnel coordination . Deputy director . " " A desk job ? " Janet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after . " " Those days are over . If he wants a job , there 's one for him . Otherwise it 's the boneyard . He must understand that . " " But will he ? " she said softly and almost to herself . Eisenhower said , " Look , is there any chance you could get a few days off and go and see him ? " She hesitated . " I suppose so . I have n't had more than a weekend in the past six months . " " Wonderful , " he said . " Naturally I 'll have someone on my staff make all the necessary travel arrangements for you . I 'll give you a letter , making clear the terms of my offer . But the real pressure must come from you . " There was a tap on the window . Eisenhower lowered it and Brisingham leaned in . " We 'll have to get moving if we 're to make that plane , General . " Eisenhower nodded impatiently and wound up the windowagain . " They wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a war , even for generals , believe me . " STORM WARNING 69Far out in the Atlantic , the horizon crackled with sheet lightning and rain started to fall heavily . The wind was force eight on the Beaufort scale , a mountainous sea running , and the Deutschland fled under staysails only , Richter and Sturmm at the wheel . At four bells in the first watch a sudden vicious squall struck from the southeast with incredible force , driving hail before it like bullets . The Deutschland lurched to one side , swinging nearly five points off course . Sturmm lost his balanceand was swept into the scuppers by a cascade of water , leaving Richter to struggle desperately with the spinning wheel . The Deutschland staggered as the wind dealt her another savage blow and started to heel over . Berger , unable to sleep , had been lying in his bunk for the best part of an hour , smoking a cigar and listening to the music of the gale . Every part of the ship creaked and groaned , and the wind whistled through the rigging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gear , seaboots , and oilskin coat , ready for any emergency . The crisis , when it came , was so unexpected that he was thrown from his bunk before he knew what was happening and rolled across the cabin , fetching up against the desk . The floor continued to incline as he tried to get up . " Oh , dear God , she 's going ! " he said aloud . Then the tiltingceased . He scrambled across to the door , got it open , and went outside . The lightning that flickered constantly in the sky above illuminated an extraordinary scene . The Deutschland was lying over , almost on her beam-ends , with her lee rail under and lower yardarm dipping into broken water . Richter and Sturmm were wrestling with the wheel and several members of the crew lurched and slithered across the sloping deck in complete panic . " She 's going ! She 's going ! " one man screamed . Berger punched him in the jaw , sending him flat on his back . He cried , " Bring her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " 70 S T O R M W A R N I N G Gradually , and with considerable difficulty , the Deutsch- land started to turn into the wind , as Richter and Sturmm got the helm up , but the deck remained at such a slope that no one could stand without hanging on to something . Berger yelled at the two nearest men , " Take the wheel and tell Richter and Mister Sturmm to come to me . " He managed to make it to the aft cargo hatch on his hands and knees and was wrestling with the ropes of the canvas cover when Sturmm and Richter arrived . " What do you think ? " Sturmm cried above the roaring of the sea . " The ballast 's moved , that 's obvious , " Berger replied . " But how much is the important thing . Let 's have this hatch cover open and see the state of the game . " Below , for the passengers , there was total confusion . When the squall struck , Sister Angela and Sister Else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cabin , discuss- ing a passage of the Scriptures , the usual evening task be- fore bed . They were both thrown to the floor , and the oil lamp fell from its hook in the ceiling to smash beside them . The spreading pool of oil flared , but was almost im- mediately extinguished as the cabin tilted , the door burst open , and water poured in . Sister Angela started to make a final act of contrition . " Oh , my God , who art infinitely good in thyself . . . " But she choked on the words , every instinct rebelling against such a calm acceptance of death . She crawled to the door , calling to Sister Else to follow her . The saloon was in total darkness , water pouring in through the shattered skylight . It was a nightmare world . Voices called hysterically . Someone lurched into her ; she reached out and touched a face as an arm fastened about her in panic . And then a cabin door opened and light flooded out as Otto Prager appeared with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was tilted at an angle of forty-five degrees , the dining table and chairs , all bolted to the floor , S T O R M W A R N I N G 71still in place , but on the port side at the bottom of the slope water had gathered to a depth of three feet . Each time the Deutschland rolled , more came in through the broken skylight , newly repaired only the previous day after the Guardian episode . Sister Angela found herself held by Sister Lotte , the youngest of the nuns . The girl was out of her mind with fear , and Sister Angela had to struggle to tear herself free . She shook the younger woman vigorously and slapped her face . " Pull yourself together , Sister . Remember what you are . " Sister Else managed to get to her feet beside her , waist deep in water , the skirt of her black robe floating around her , and at that moment , the cabin door next to Prager 's opened and Sisters Kathe and Brigitte peered through . Prager @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be fine , Sisters , no need to panic . Make for the com-panionway . " Sister Angela got there first , an arm around Sister Lotte . Prager handed her the lantern and assisted the others , one by one , until they were all on the tilting companionway . As he moved up to join Sister Angela , the door at the head of the companionway opened and Berger peered in , a storm lantern in one hand . " Everyone all right ? " " I think so , " Sister Angela said . He crouched down to speak to her . " No point in putting you into one of the boats . It would n't last five minutes in this sea . You understand me , Sister ? " " What must we do then , Kapitan ? " " Stay here for the moment . " " What 's gone wrong , Eric ? " Prager demanded . " The ballast has shifted into the lee bow . Most of the crew are down there now trying to do something about it . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hits while we 're in this state she 'll turn turtle . " Prager moved out into the night without a word . Sister Angela said , " Is there anything we can do , Kapitan ? " 72 S T O R M W A R N I N G " Pray , " Eric Berger told her . " Very hard . " And he slammed the door shut and disappeared . When Otto Prager went down the ladder into the cargo hold it was like a descent into hell . The crew worked in the light of a couple of storm lanterns , furiously shoveling sand to windward . Each time the ship rolled , men stumbled into each other and went down . Prager stepped off the ladder and fell to one knee . Someonecried out in fear , but otherwise everyone shoveled away with a grim frenzy , the only sound the creaking of the ship 's timbers and the gale outside . A strong arm hoisted Prager to his feet and Helmut Richter grinned down at him . " Just think , Herr Prager , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment enjoyinga drink before a late dinner , looking out from the terraceof the Copacabana at the lights in the bay ... " " Well , I 'm not , " Prager told him , " so just give me a bloody shovel and let 's get to it . " For some time now it had been obvious that the Deutschlandwas tilting to windward , but on the companionway in the half darkness it seemed an eternity before the door opened again and Berger peered in . He managed a smile , but only just . " Did you pray , Sister ? " " We did . " " Well , for what it 's worth , your prayers were answered . Somebody on this tub must live right . It is n't me , so it must be you . " " I 'm willing to admit that possibility , Kapitan . " " Excellent . We 'll have the pump working as soon as we can , but it may not be possible to light a fire in the galley again before morning . I 'm afraid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the rest of the night . " " We 'll manage . " S T O R M W A R N I N G 73In a sudden outburst , he added roughly , " Damn it , Sister , it was you who insisted on coming . I warned you . " " Yes , Kapitan , I believe you did , " she said . " And for that I thank you , among other things . " She looked down at the faces of the others , upturned in the dim light of the lamp . " Shall we pray , my beloved sisters ? " She began to recite aloud the prayers for thanksgiving after a storm . " So they cried unto the Lord in their trouble ; and he delivered them from their distress . " Berger shut the companionway door and turned toward Prager who leaned wearily on the hatch beside him . " What a woman , " he said . " What a bloody infuriating  --  " " Wonderful woman , " Prager finished . Berger laughed , then turned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own now , for the wind had dropped a little , although there was still a heavy sea running . Sturmm came down the ladder to join him . " I 've got a party on the pump , sir . Any further orders ? " " Yes , " Berger said . " Wood , Mister Sturmm . Every plank you can find . Gut the ship if needs be . Every cabin and locker , but I want that sand decked off within twenty-four hours so it ca n't damn well move again , whatever hap-pens . " " Aye , aye , sir . " Sturmm hesitated . " A close one , Ka-pitan . " " Too close , " Eric Berger said . " Let 's try not to make a habit of it , " and he turned and walked toward his cabin . Barkentine Deutschland , 17 September 1944 . Lat. 38  --  56'N , long . 3o  --  5o'W . Wind hauled into the west duringthe middle watch and we braced the yards forward . Hove the log and found we were going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sun to come through , the wind dropping to a flat calm . FiveThe Deutschland seemed to float in space , completely still , every sail set , yards braced , perfectly reflected in a sea of green glass . It was hot and airless . Conditions below were unbearable and , on the captain 's orders , a canvas awning had been rigged aft of the mainmast so that the sisters might be protectedto some degree from the fierceness of the sun . Most of the crew and passengers were suffering from sea boils now , a product not only of the unsatisfactory diet but76 STORM WARNING STORM WARNING 77of the constant action of salt water on the skin . One of the men , a brawny Hamburger named Schirmer , was virtually crippled by a whole crop of them on his left leg . He leaned back groaning in a canvas chair while Sister Angela went to work with a lancet . Forward from the mainmast , under the supervision of Sturmm , four of the crew worked the heavy metal bar of the ship 's two suction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stream . Richter , who had just finished a thirty-minute stint himself , dipped a pannier into the water bucket , wrinkling his nose in disgust . " Have you seen this , Herr Leutnant ? " he asked Sturmm , and poured the contents of the pannier back into the bucket . The water was dark red . " Rust from the tanks , I expect . " Sturmm grinned . " On this ship we think of everything , Helmut . You do n't just get a drink of water . We throw in an iron tonic as well . Good for the constitution . " " My belly does n't agree . " Richter ran a hand across his stomach . " Sometimes the cramps are terrible . Most of the lads will tell you the same . " Sister Lotte was standing by the mizzen shrouds on the port side . Like the other nuns she had put on her white tropical habit again , because of the heat . And , as always , Richter wondered how on earth she managed to keep it so clean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , one hand on a rope , gazing out to sea . Walz , the cook , came out of the galley and emptied a pail of garbage over the rail beside her . She moved back hastily . " Sorry , Sister , " he said , with total insincerity . " That 's all right , Herr Walz , " she answered in a low , sweet voice . He looked her over boldly and grinned , showing bad teeth . The lust in his eyes was plain : her smile faded and she reached for the shrouds as if to support herself . Walz turned back to the galley and found Richter leaning against the entrance . He was stripped to the waist , his muscular body burned brown by the sun , the long , blond hair and beard bleached white , a black Brazilian cigarillo between his teeth . A match flared in the bosun 's cupped hands . As he leaned down to it , he said softly , " Manners , you bastard . That is n't some San Pauli whore you 're talking to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Walz grinned again . " I do n't blame you . It 's a long trip home and women are women , as the captain said , whatever they choose to wear . It 's what 's between the legs that counts . " He was hurled into the shadows of the galley , found himself back across the table , a hand of iron at his throat . There was a sharp click as the blade of the Finnish gutting knife in the bosun 's right hand sprang into view . " One wrong word , you lump of dung , " Richter said calmly , " try even looking at her again as you did now and you go over the side  --  and I would n't like to guarantee it 'll be in one piece . " Walz almost fainted with terror , felt his bowels move . The bosun patted his face . " That 's it , Ernst . That 's exactly the way I like you . Frightened to death . " He snapped the blade of the gutting knife back into place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mizzen shrouds and , at that moment , an albatross swooped down to where the garbage floated , motionless as the ship itself . She turned , as if by instinct , and became aware that Richter was watching her . She smiled and he crossed the deck to join her . " Mister Richter . " There was no attempt to conceal the pleasure in her eyes . " That bird  --  what was it ? " " An albatross , Sister . King of the scavengers . There 'll be more around soon , when they get wind of our garbage . " " So beautiful . " She shaded her eyes against the sun and watched it go. 78 S T O R M W A R N I N GAnd so are you , by God , Richter thought . " They say an albatross is probably the ghost of a dead sailor . " " And you believe that ? " Her eyes were very blue , her face a perfect oval framed by the white coif . Richter 's throat was suddenly dry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Superstitious nonsense . " He took a deep breath . " Now , if you 'll excuse me , I must see the Kapitan " He had a rope burn on his right wrist . She reached for his hand and frowned . " That 's nasty . It could get worse . You must let me see to it for you . " Her fingers were cool . There was sweat on his brow and then , across her shoulder , he saw that Sister Angela , seated under the awning , her medical case open beside her as she treated one of the seamen , was watching him gravely . Richter pulled his hand away . " No need , Sister . It 's nothing , believe me . " Berger , seated at the desk in his cabin , was entering the log. i8 September 1944 . A bad night . Rain and heavy seas . Lower t'gallant split during a sudden squall at six bells in the midwatch . Weather changes again to flat calm in the forenoon . Mister Sturmm reports sixteen inches of water in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back , aware of the dull monotonousthumping of the pump . Not good . Not good at all for her to be taking so much water . Although he had said nothing to Sturmm and Richter about it , he knew that the seriousness of the situation must be as apparent to them as it was to him . There was a knock on the door and Richter entered . " Mister Sturmm 's compliments , sir . From the sound of things , she 's just about dry again . " Berger nodded . " What do you think , Helmut ? " S T O R M W A R N I N G 79Richter shrugged . " She 's old , sir . Too old , and I should n't think the copper 's been off her in years . God knows what state her timbers are in . " He hesitated . " And when that squall struck the other night , when she nearly turned turtle . . . " " You think she took some damage that we were n't aware of ? " Before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , mixed with cheering . And a strange drumming . Berger was on his feet in an instant , got the door open , and rushed outside with Richter at his heels . It was raining , a freak tropical downpour . Most of the crew were running about the deck like madmen , those who had been able to find buckets holding them up to catch the sweet water . The nuns , sheltering under the awning , were laughing like children as water poured from it in a torrent . Sturmm stood underneath the impromptu shower , water cascading over his head . He turned and , seeing Berger , moved aside hurriedly . " Sorry , Kapitan . Collective madness . " He stood mopping his face with his neckerchief , like a schoolboy caught out . The rain ceased as suddenly as it had started , and steam began to rise from the decks . Berger said , " How 's the pumping ? " " Sucked dry , sir . " Sturmm hesitated . " For the moment . " Berger nodded , aware that most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any information that was going . He made his judgment and acted on it . There was , after all , little point in pretending the situation did n't exist . " Not good , Mister Sturmm . Sixteen inches today . The same yesterday . Fourteen the day before . There has to be a reason . " There was a heavy silence , broken only by the creaking of the rigging and the slapping of the-empty sails . Richter spoke first . " Maybe I should go down and take a look , Kapitan. " 8o S T O R M W A R N I N G S T O R M W A R N I N G 81He was an excellent swimmer , and strong as a bull . With the ship totally becalmed , there was little danger . Berger nodded . " All right . " He took a key from his pocket and handed it to Sturmm . " Get a rifle from the gun locker , just in case . " As Richter pulled off his canvas , rope-soled shoes , Sister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rifle , Kapitan ? " Berger shrugged . " Sharks . No sign now , but amazing how they appear with a man in the water , and all that garbagedoes n't help . " Sister Lotte turned pale . She moved to Richter 's side where he stood at the rail , tightening his belt . " It 's  --  it 's very deep , is n't it , Mister Richter ? " Richter laughed out loud . " A thousand fathoms , at least . But do n't worry , I 'm not going all the way down . " Berger , listening to this exchange , frowned , but the time was hardly appropriate to make any comment . Insteadhe said , " You want a line , Helmut ? " Richter shook his head . " Why bother ? There is n't an inch of movement in her . " He put one foot on the rail , sprang up , and dived cleanly into the water . A shoal of small fish scattered before him , disintegrating in a silver cloud . He went down fast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with sunlight . The planks of the hull of the Deutschland were coated with barnacles , and sea grass sprouted everywhere in a gaudy carpet . Years since her bottom 's been scraped , he thought , and he swam down to the keel , hanging on to it for a moment , then started to work his way along toward the prow . On deck , they waited in silence . Richter surfaced once for air , waved , and went under again . Sister Lotte gripped the rail tightly , her knuckles white as she stared down into the water . Berger , watching her closely , glanced up and found Sister Angela looking at him . Her face was calm but there was something close to pain in her eyes . He took out his pipe and started to fill it from the worn oilskin pouch . More problems . As if he did n't have enough on his plate . And why did it have to be Richter , the finest seaman in the crew ? At that moment the bosun surfaced and floated at the port @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Someone tossed him a line and he was hauled over the rail . He squatted on the deck for a moment , shivering . Berger said , " How was it ? You can speak up . Let everyone hear . " " Nothing marked , Kapitan , " Richter said . " No sign of any real damage . It 's as we thought : she 's a very old lady . In places there are gaps between her planks where you can stick two fingers . I 'd say she needed recaulking ten years ago . " Berger turned to address the men . " You heard him . Nothing we ca n't handle . And with double the normal crew there wo n't be any difficulties in manning the pump . " The faces around him were still filled with uncertainty , but at that moment the mainsail flapped as a tiny wind rippled the water from the southeast . Berger looked up as the sails started to fill , and laughed . " There you are  --  a good omen . We 're on the move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you please . " Sturmm barked orders and the crew broke away . Sister Angela said , " If you have a moment , Kapitan , I 'd like a word with you . " Berger glanced from her to Lotte who , with the other nuns , was clearing away her belongings from under the awning . " All right , Sister . " In his cabin , she faced him across the desk , perfectly composed , hands folded . " Lotte is the most vulnerable of those among my charges , Kapitan . It is my sworn duty to see that nothing interferes with the path she has chosen . " " What you 're trying to say is that she is n't a proper nun yet , " Berger said . " Not like the rest of you ? " He shook his head . " It does n't make any kind of difference to me , I assure you . My orders to the crew are plain where you and your friends are concerned . " " And Mister Richter ? " 82 STORM WARNINGHe leaned back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so you 've caught him looking at the girl a few times . What do you expect me to do about that ? " " She was afraid for him when he went over the side and she allowed it to show . " " He 's a good-looking boy . " " Which is exactly what 's worrying me . " Berger said , " Helmut Richter was Obersteuermann on a U-boat before he fetched up in Brazil like the rest of us . Chief helmsman , to you . Iron Cross , Second and First Class . The finest seaman I 've ever known and a remarkable young man in every way . You 've nothing to worry about , believe me . " " I have your assurance in this matter , then ? " " Yes , damn it . " He was unable to contain his exasperation , went to the door , opened it , and called to Sturmm , " Send Richter in here . " As he went back to his desk , Sister Angela made a move toward the door . Berger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might as well hear this . " She hesitated , and at that moment there was a knock on the door and Richter entered . He had put on a heavy sweater and reefer , but still looked pale . " You wanted me , Herr Kapitan ? " Berger produced a bottle and a glass from his desk cupboard . " Scotch whisky . Haig and Haig . The very best . You 've earned it . " " It was colder than I thought down there . " Richter drank some of the whisky and Berger sat down . " How long have we known each other , Helmut ? " " A year , Kapitan . Fourteen months to be precise . ' Why do you ask ? " " The young nun , " Berger told him . " Sister Lotte . " He hesitated , choosing his words . " She was worried about you ? " Richter glanced at Sister Angela , his face paler than everS T O R M W A R N I N G 83now , then placed his glass on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Do n't play the fool with me , Helmut , " Berger snapped . " The girl is still a novice . Do you know what that means to these people ? " " That she has n't made up her mind yet , " Richter said evenly . " And you 'd like to make it up for her , is that it ? " Richter glanced at Sister Angela , then turned back to Berger . " You do n't understand , either of you , so let me make it plain . " He held up his left hand . " Before I would see harm come to her from any man , I would cut this off . " " I believe you , boy . And what happens when we reach Kiel and dry land again will be none of my concern , but for the present , you 'll stay away from her . I could make it an order , but I wo n't . I 'll simply ask for your word instead . " For a moment he thought that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hesitation was only fractional . He braced himself , heels together . " You have it , sir . " " That 's all right , then . " Richter went out quickly and Berger said to Sister Angela , " Was there anything else ? " " No , I do n't think so . I appear to anger you at times , Kapitan . I wonder why ? " " God knows , Sister . I wish I did . I 've experienced a few hard cases in my time ; you get them in every crew . They can be handled well enough . With boot and fist if necessary , but you . . . " She said gently , " Poor Kapitan Berger . If only everything in life were capable of such a simple solution . " She went out . Berger sat there , thinking about it , realizingsuddenly that it was the first time he 'd seen her smile . Like many a distinguished sailor before him , seasickness was an old story to Rear Admiral Otto Friemel , and the foul weather that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brest had had an unfortunate84 STORM WARNINGeffect on his stomach . On arrival off the mouth of the Fal , he had accepted the offer of the bunk in Gericke 's cabin on which to recover . He slept surprisingly well and drifted up from darkness into a world of total silence . For a moment he could not remember where he was and lay there frowning in the dim light . Then the curtain was pulled back and Gericke enteredwith a pot of coffee and two cups on a tray . Friemel swung his legs to the floor . " Things were a total blank . Does that ever happen to you ? " " Frequently . " " A nasty feeling . Perhaps I 'm getting too old . For this sort of thing certainly . " Gericke said , " It 's the war , that 's all . It 's gone on too long . " He took a chart from the shelf above the bunk and opened it out across the small table . Friemel said , " It 's damned quiet . " " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lying down . Those who have to move are walking with rags around their boots . " " How are they taking it ? " " The prospect of imminent death , you mean ? " Gericke shrugged . " They 're good lads , and we 've been together a long time . But they 've been to Japan and back , remember , so there 's a distinct feeling that we could be taking our pitcher to the well once too often . " He lit a cigarette and picked up a slide rule . " Of course , it has n't helped that I 've taken the coding machine to pieces and distributed them around the crew in case the worst comes to the worst . " " And you share their pessimism ? " " Not entirely . " Gericke traced a pencil across the mouth of the Fal from Blackrock Beacon to St. Anthony 's Head . " According to the Abwehr 's friendly local agent the boom is positioned here . Getting in is no problem . There have been several ships in and out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ N I N G 85they 've always been singles . I 'd rather follow a small convoyif possible . It would give us better cover . " Friemel inserted a cigarette in his holder . " Another point in your favor , as I see it , is that at this stage in the war the Tommies are hardly likely to expect a German U-boat to attempt to penetrate a major naval installation . " " A comforting thought . But I 'd rather not rely on it . Once in , we drop the mines through the stern tubes . Here in Carrick Roads , across the mouth of the inner harbor , what 's left across the entrance to St. Mawes ... " " And out again . " " You forget the boom . We 'll need a ship coming in or out for it to open again . We 'll have to wait . And if anyone'sunfortunate enough to touch off one of those mines in the meantime , the door , I assure you , will remain very tightly shut . " " And what do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another possibility . Not much of a one , but it 's there . " Gericke ran his pencil across to Pendennis Point . " Here , between the Point and Blackrock Beacon . " " The minefield ? " Friemel said . " A death trap , surely . " " Not the inshore run . South Passage , they call it . Accordingto the Abwehr report , they have n't bothered to mine it . Simply stopped the hole by sinking an old merchantship . " Friemel looked at the map . " In six meters . It would surprise me if a mackerel could find room to squeeze past . " " Six meters now , " Gericke said , " but at high tide , which tonight is at twenty-three-hundred hours , nine meters at least in that slot . " Friemel examined the map again . " Sorry , Paul , but I just do n't see it . Barely room to submerge , even at high water . And the navigation would be impossible . " " But I was n't thinking of submerging , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay on the bridge and give steering directions . I 've memorized the chart . " " God in heaven ! " Friemel whispered. 86 S T O R M W A R N I N GThe green curtain was pulled aside and Lieutenant Karl Engel , the first watch officer , appeared . " Contact , sir . Ships moving in from the east , line astern . Three , possibly four . " Gericke glanced at his watch . It was a few minutes past nine . " Sounds like exactly what we 've been waiting for . You know what to do . Ready to move out in five minutes from now . We follow them in blind . I 'll take the helm my-self . " " No periscope ? " Friemel said . " Not until we 're well into Carrick Roads . " Engel disappeared and the curtain dropped back into place . Gericke opened a cupboard under the bunk and took out a bottle and a couple of tin mugs . " Schnapps ? " Friemel asked . " The best . " Gericke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's been to Japan and back , this bottle . The one I keep only for the most special occasions . " " And to what shall we drink , my dear Paul ? " asked Rear Admiral Otto Friemel . " Why , to the game , " Gericke said . " That would seem appropriate . To the bloody stupid and imbecilic game we 've all been playing for five years now , which would once more appear , as they say , to be afoot . " Janet Munro came awake reluctantly to the persistent buzzing of the front doorbell . She had a splitting headache ; her mouth was dry . She lay staring up at the ceiling through the darkness , trying to pull herself together , hopingthat damn noise would cease . But it did n't . Suddenly angry , she flung the bedclothes aside and reached for her bathrobe . ' When she opened the front door , a tall , slightly built young naval officer in reefer coat and peaked cap was reaching for the bell again . He had stooped shoulders and seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scar ran down the left side of the face . She glanced at her watch . It was just after ten . She 'd hadthree hours sleep . Under the circumstances she found considerabledifficulty in keeping her temper . " Yes , what is it ? " " Dr. Munro ? My name 's Jago . Harry Jago . " " I 'm afraid you 've chosen the wrong night . I do n't know who sent you , but I have to sleep . Maybe some other time . " Jago 's smile faded . He suddenly looked very young . " You do n't understand . " He produced a letter from his pocket and held it out to her . " Your uncle asked me to deliver this . " She frowned . " Uncle Carey ? I thought he was still in the Hebrides . " " That 's right . I spoke with him on Fhada the day before yesterday . " She took the letter from him and nodded slowly as if still having difficulty in taking it all in . " And what are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I run a kind of postal service around the islands , " Jago said cheerfully . " Hardly the dead center of the only war we 've got . " " While good men and true are fighting and dying elsewhere ? It 's a point of view . " He was no longer smiling . " Anyway , you 've got your letter , Doctor , and if you 're interested , the admiral was in good health when I last saw him . " She regretted the sarcasm instantly . She had become increasinglyprone to such cruel remarks of late . " Just a minute , " she said . Jago turned . She smiled . " You 'd better come in and have a drink while I read this . " The living room was small and untidy . She switched on the electric fire and sat down . " Take off your coat and help yourself to a drink . You 'll find some Scotch in the corner cupboard . No ice , I 'm afraid . Something you learn to live without over here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one would be fine . Nice and straight . " 88 S T O R M W A R N I N GHe took off his coat and cap and moved to the cupboard , and while he busied himself getting the drinks she read the letter . It told her nothing she had not already learned from General Eisenhower , and was mainly concerned with her uncle 's desperate need to get back into the war again . Talking it out , she thought , just as if I were sitting in front of him , that 's all he 's doing . She looked up as Jago came back with a couple of glasses , and the first thing she noticed was the Navy Cross ribbon . She took the drink automatically , without even sayingthank you . " Sorry about the delay , " Jago said . " The letter , I mean . I tried here yesterday evening but you were out , and when I called at the hospital today , they said you were too busy to see anyone . " " You could have left it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you got it person-ally . " " You 're a rotten liar , you know that ? " " I 'm afraid so . " " Why was it so important ? " " He showed me a photo of you . " She laughed again . " And what is that supposed to do  --  sweep me off my feet ? " " No , ma'am , " Jago said . " You asked me , I told you , that 's all . " He stood up and reached for his reefer . " I 'd betterbe moving . " " Oh , be your age , for God 's sake . " She was suddenly angry again . " Let me tell you something , Lieutenant . Tonight , I feel not only totally exhausted but old enough to be your mother . " " You 're twenty-seven , " he said . " Birthday , November ninth . That 's Scorpio , and I can certainly see why . " " Did you get that out of Uncle Carey , too ? All right , I surrender @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those circum-stances ? " " Strike your flag . " S T O R M W A R N I N G 89 " I 've had a rather heavy afternoon , " she said . " Fourteen flying bombs hit London today . Maybe you heard the bangs but I saw the results . I fell into bed exactly three hours ago . Then you arrived . " He was on his feet again in a moment . " I 'm sorry . I just did n't realize . " " You brought a letter for Ike as well , did n't you ? " He hesitated and she carried on . " Do n't worry , you are n't givingaway state secrets . He spoke to me about it last night . My uncle 's trying to get back into the glorious fight . " Jago did n't know what to say . He was fascinated by this strange , abrasive girl , by her wide , almost ugly mouth , and her harsh , distinctive voice . She said , " When are you going back ? The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Me , too . I mean , I 'm going to see my uncle , courtesy of the supreme commander , but they have n't given me a date yet . " " Maybe we 'll be on the same train . " She took an English cigarette from a packet on the mantelpieceand he lit it for her . " And the rest of your leave ? What do you plan to do with that ? " " I do n't really know . " Jago shrugged . " There does n't seem to be too much fun in this town these days . " " Oh , I do n't know , " she said . " You Yanks seem to do all right , with your cigarettes and whiskey . Why , you can even get a cab when you need one , which is more than the locals can , believe me . " " Is that how you see yourself ? A kind of American Cockney ? " " I came out of Paris in 1940 . I 've been here ever since . " There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say . Janet said , " Where are you going now ? Out on the town ? " " I do n't think so . I 've got a bed in one of the officers ' clubs . " 90 S T O R M W A R N I N G " And just think  --  you could be walking along the Embankmentwith me . " He stared at her . " The Embankment ? " " Sure , why not ? I could do with the air . Give me three minutes to throw something on . " She crossed to the bedroomdoor and paused to look back at him . " You do n't mind , do you ? " In Falmouth , coasting along at periscope depth , U-235 discharged the last of her mines across the entrance to St. Mawes harbor and started to turn away . Gericke was at the periscope , Admiral Friemel and Engel beside him , and the chief helmsman , Willie Carlsen , at the helm . The tensionhad been incredible , the crew padding about like ghosts , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Engel 's face . He said eagerly , " And now we go home ? " " Bergen is home ? " Gericke said as he started his sweep , checking the situation in the harbor . But at that moment a tug , emerging from Carrick Roads , struck one of the mines . There was an instant searingexplosion , a tongue of flame that illuminated the entire harbor area . The concussion drummed on the hull of the submarine . " Oh , my God , " Engel moaned . Friemel , face ashen , plucked at Gericke 's shoulder . " A mine ? " " I 'm afraid so . Strike one . " And then he seemed to go rigid , his shoulders hunched . He turned to look at them . " There are two river-class frigates moored almost side by side just north of the inner harbor . " " Not even you could be crazy enough for such a thing , " Engel said desperately . " We would n't stand a chance . " " And what chance do we stand now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Two of them . " He seemed to crackle with electricity , his face veryS T O R M W A R N I N G 91white , his mad , dark eyes blazing . It was as if he had been sleeping and was now awake . He turned on Friemel . " Konteradmiral ? " Friemel found himself shaking , not with fear , but with a kind of fierce joy . " Why not , by God ? A hell of a way to go , Paul . " And Engel , touched now by the same madness , all fear leaving him , saluted , heels together . " At your orders , Herr Kapitan . " " Good man , " Gericke clapped him on the shoulder . " Take her up . We 'll have to do this the hard way . Prepare tubes one to four for surface firing . " He turned to Carlsen . " You take the helm , Willie , and make it good . " There was a sudden bustle of activity , the klaxon soundingbattle stations . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over his shoulder , " Perhaps you 'd care to join me on the bridge , Herr Konteradmiral ? " At the top of the ladder he waited . There was a hiss of compressed air , a rushing of water , and then Engel called , " The hatch is above water . " Gericke unclipped it and scrambled out onto the bridge of the conning tower . Heavy rain smacked solidly into his face and the waters of the harbor heaved in turmoil . The tug was almost under now but the oil around it was on fire , and when he focused his night glasses , men jumped into view , hurling themselves into the icy water . In the forward torpedo compartment the crew worked frantically to make ready . Engel was already aligning the attack periscope as Gericke swung his glasses to focus on the two frigates . Beside him , Friemel said , " A lot of activity on deck . I 'd say you 've got three minutes before they chop those anchorsand get out of there . " Alarm klaxons echoed stridently across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harbor wall . Suddenly , there was a hollow staccato booming and brilliant92 STORM W ARNINGballs of fire seemed to cascade toward them in a great curve , falling into the water to port . " That 's it , " Friemel said grimly . " They know we 're here . " U-235 surged forward . Gericke said calmly , " Tubes one to four prepare for surface firing . " Engel called into the voice pipe . There was the briefest of pauses before he looked up . " One to four ready , sir . " " Six meters , " Gericke said . " Line of sight . One and two on the starboard frigate , three and four take care of the gentleman to port . Distance one thousand meters , speed thirty-five . Director angle blue four . " Engel relayed the orders through the voice pipe to LeadingSeaman Pich , who manned the TDC , the complicated electrical device linking gyro compass , attack periscope , and torpedo circuits , which from now on would , in effect , be responsible for the success @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connection . Engel guided the aiming cross of the attack periscope onto the starboard frigate which , relieved of its anchor , was starting to swerve to port . " Blue four , ready to fire , sir ! " " Fire , " Gericke called . " Tube one fire . Tube two fire ! " The U-boat staggered as the torpedoes broke free and raced toward the target at thirty-five knots . The port frigate was moving now , surging forward as her captain gave her everything she had , the bow wave rising . " She 'll make it , Paul . She 'll make it , " Friemel cried , his binoculars glued to his eyes . " Oh , no , she wo n't , " Gericke said calmly . " This is my night . Hard starboard , " he called . " It 's all yours , Karl . Fire at will . " Machine-gun bullets rattled against the conning tower , and several shells landed close enough on the port side to cause the U-boat to roll violently . But it was Karl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cooler than he had ever been , as the captain of the frigate made his one mistake , turningSTORM WARNING 93to starboard to bring all guns to bear , momentarily exposinghis entire port side , a perfect target . As the torpedoes were released , the U-boat corkscrewed in the heavy seas . " Hard port , " Gericke called . " And tell Deetz to give me everything he 's got . " There was a muffled explosion , followed by another , as the first two torpedoes struck home . A cheer drifted up from the control room . Across the water , orange fire erupted from the first frigate and black smoke billowed into the night . The second was turning frantically now , as if her captain already sensed that the ax was about to fall , her guns still firing . A moment later , number three torpedo hit , closely followed by the fourth . The frigate staggered drunkenly , her prow seemed to lift high into the air , then plunged . There was a further great explosion and flames towered into the night . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The magazine . It has to be . " He called to Engel . " I said speed , damn you ! Speed ! Let 's get out of here . " All hell had broken loose now , guns firing across the harborfrom the shore installations . Friemel , ducking between the steel canopy as a bullet ricocheted close to his head , said , " Gun crew , Paul ? " " No , " Gericke said . " We 'd only give them a better target . We 'll be out of it soon , believe me . They wo n't be expectingus to try the South Passage run . It is n't supposed to exist , remember . " The wind rolled thick , oily smoke in a black pall across the harbor , blanketing the entire scene , and U-235 , hidden from view , made toward Pendennis Point at full speed . The tide was running fast under the Point as they turned into the channel . In the control room , Engel had the helm , Friemel at his shoulder . Everyone seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , young Heini Roth , the second watch officer. 94 STORM WARNINGThe diesels had stopped and the propellers were being driven by the electric motors . It seemed very still , and when Gericke 's voice crackled over the tannoy , Roth gave a startled gasp . " We have n't got too much time to spare . The tide 's beginning to ebb and there 's a five- or six-knot current running , so let 's get it right first time . " His voice , clearly audible to every man on board , was properly calm . Engel , speaking into the microphone box above his head , barely managed to keep his voice steady as he replied , " Aye , aye , sir . Ready when you are . " Gericke , on the bridge , was colder than he 'd ever been in his life before . Reaction , he told himself , to all that action and passion . He managed a smile . He wore a life jacket , headphones , and a throat microphone , and was up to his chest in water . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and considerable broken water gave him a far better view of the general situation than he had expected . The hubbub on the far side of the harbor seemed muffled and far away , without reality . " Course one-eight-two , " he said . Engel 's voice crackled in his ears . " Seven meters under the keel . . . six meters under the keel . " They surged on , caught by the current , white water all around , and somewhere high above in the night , the turret on Pendennis Point lifted into the darkness . Gericke could hear traffic , and wondered briefly whether there might be searchlights mounted . There was sudden panic in Engel 's voice . " Two meters , sir . Only two meters under the keel . . . one meter . " Gericke said calmly , " Steady as she goes , Karl . Nice and easy . Half ahead . " " We would appear to have run out of water , my dear Paul , " Friemel 's voice sounded equally calm . U-235 seemed to shudder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that set on edge the teeth of every man on board . " Oh , God , that 's it , " Heini Roth said aloud in the controlroom . And yet they were still moving , a long , continuous gratingthat suddenly ceased as Gericke 's voice called , " Full ahead . " There was a ragged cheer through the entire boat . " He 's done it ! " Deetz said excitedly . " As usual , " he added . Gericke 's voice sounded again . " If you think we 're out of the woods yet , forget it . We have n't passed the blockship . A hundred meters to go . I can see her plain . Half engines and make ready to give me everything you 've got when I give the word . " On the bridge he faced the last obstacle . U-235 drifted forward in the grip of the current that coursed through South Passage as the tide started to ebb . The blockship was an old coaster , her single stack clear against the night sky , deck awash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slot between the rocks and the blockship seemed inconceivablynarrow , but it was too late to turn back now . Again there was a grating under the keel . Engel 's voice was frantic . " There should be six meters , sir . Six meters . " The grating stopped as the U-boat slid on . " Probably a chain , " Gericke said . " Keep going , Karl . Not long now . " Somewhere behind him , beyond the smoke on the other side of the harbor , there was a muffled explosion . He paid no heed , and gave all his concentration to the task in hand , gripping the rail with numbed fingers . And then the boat seemed to be caught in a giant hand and pushed forward by a sudden fierce current . The blockshipwas alongside  --  the stack looming above him , rusting plates , bridge windows smashed , a ghost ship . He leaned over the rail . This was the moment of maxi-96 S T O R M W A R N I N G mum danger , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up like a sardine can . There was a grating on the starboard side , the cliff seemed very close , too close , and then , as they swung to port in the current , the blockship seemed to drift away into the night , was suddenly abeam . Gericke said hoarsely , " We 're into clear water . Heavy seas . Wind force six by my estimation . Full ahead ; diesels , too , if you please . " The scene in the control room was incredible . Deetz burst into tears and Friemel , in an excess of emotion , grabbed Heini Roth and hugged him . " Remarkable , " the admiral said . " There I was , lying in my coffin ready to go . Now I 've just been told it was all a mistake . " On the bridge , Gericke hung on tight as U-235 rode into the full force of the wind sweeping in from the Channel . It was very dark now , with no landmarks to guide him , as one great wave after another slapped over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his ears . Better to get out of it now . " All riht Karl " he said . " Bringthen we 'll submerge till we 're n her umidch andannel. let " me get dry , And suddenly , the roaring was louder and it was no longer the sea . He became conscious of an enormous , white bow wave to starboard . There was a tremendous crash , the tearing of metal , as a dark , greyhound shape plowed right across the U-boat 's forecastle and plunged on into the night . The U-boat rolled , the conning tower swung to port , and Gericke was tossed over the side . " My night , " he thought , for some inane reason clutch- ing at his cap . " Was n't that what I said ? " And then he hit the water and the first wave rolled over him . The dim shape Gericke had glimpsed momentarily as she plowed across the U-boat 's forecastle was a Vospar MTB of the Royal Navy 's Fifteenth Flotilla , racing home from S T O R @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirty-five knots , on receipt of the news from Falmouthover the radio . Now she drifted helplessly , making water , all engines stopped . On the bridge , her commander , an RNVR lieutenantnamed Drummond , was taking the damage report from the boat 's chief petty officer . " How long have we got , Chief ? " " In this sea , an hour at the most , sir . If they want to save her they 'd better get a tug out here fast . " " You 're certain it was a submarine ? " " Definite , sir . Leading Seaman Cooper saw it , too . " He hesitated . " But whether one of ours or theirs , I could n't be sure . " " My God , " Drummond said softly . There was an excited cry aft of the bridge . " Someone in the water , sir , off the port rail . " " Searchlight , " Drummond said . " Quickly now ! " The beam sliced across the broken water and picked out Gericke in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ears . He waved as he was swept in under the rail . " Quickly ! " Drummond called . " He must be frozen half to death in there . " Bell , the petty officer , ran down from the bridge to supervise . There was a flurry of activity at the rail and Gericke was hauled aboard . Drummond leaned over the bridge rail , watching anxiously , training the searchlight on them , and then Bell looked up . " Good God , sir , we 've got ourselves a Jerry . " In London it was raining hard , and fog crouched at the ends of the streets . Janet Munro 's trench coat was soaked through as was the scarf bound around her hair . They had walked for several miles in the pouring rain  --  Birdcage Walk , the Palace , St. James 's Park , and Downing Street , although Jago had n't been able to see very much . Not that he cared. 98 STORM WARNING " Sure you have n't had enough ? " he asked as they moved down toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something special , re-member ? " " Did you ? " Jago looked puzzled . They came to the bridge and she turned onto the Embankment . " Well , this is it , " she said . " The most romantic place in town . Every American in London should walk along the Embankment at least once , preferably after mid-night . " " It 's almost that now , " Jago said . " Good , we 'll have another cigarette and wait for the witching hour . " They leaned on the parapet and listened to the lapping of the water . " Have you enjoyed it , your guided tour ? " she asked . " Oh , yes , ma'am , you could say that , " Jago told her . " I was a stranger in your city , but not anymore . " " I like that , " she said . " You 're a poet , too . " " Not me , " Jago said . " Thank the Gershwins . " He leaned over the parapet beside her . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " We have a special relationship . I 've seen her through good times and bad , often burning like hell , and we 're still here , both of us . " " But you do n't like people much ? " Her chin tilted . He could sense anger in her , barely contained . " Should I , darling ? I wish you could give me a good reason . " " What is it , Doctor ? Do n't you think you 're up to the snuff ? Do you have to let too many people die ? " " Damn you to hell , Jago . " Her hand went up as if she would strike him . Big Ben chimed the first stroke of midnight . Jago put up his arms defensively . " The witching hourremember . And this is the Embankment , the most romanticplace in London . " STORM WARNING 99She reached out to touch his face . " Tell me , Jago , did they cut you up badly back there ? Did they take a few years off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . The last stroke of midnight boomed out . The rain increasedinto a drenching downpour and she seemed to be standing very close . Tentatively he put his hands on her shoulders . She ran a hand up behind his head and kissed him passionately on the mouth . " Take me home , Jago , " she whispered . Barkentine Deutschland , 19 September 1944 . Lat. 430 4'N , long . 2o  --  55'W . Last night in the middle watch , fore upper topsail split during a bad blow . Weather continues to deteriorate . Full gale in the morning watch with big sea running . SixIn spite of the fact that it was only two bells of the afternoonwatch , it was so dark in the saloon that Sister Angela had to light the lamp . She sat at the table which , like the chairs , was bolted to the floor . Her Bible was open in front of her . Lotte sat opposite , busy with needle and thread as she mended a denim shirt . Outside , the wind howled and the Deutschland rolled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , an event that would once have caused them both considerable102 S T O R M W A R N I N Galarm , but not now . Water trickled down the companionwaysteps and slopped across the floor . It was cold and damp  --  everything was damp  --  even the blanket that she had draped around her shoulders . Lotte , concentrating on her task in the poor light , smiled briefly , as if at some private thought . Sister Angela had seen that smile often of late , knew only too well what it meant . It was as if the girl was slipping away from her , from everything that had once seemed so important  --  and for what ? She was aware of anger rising inside as old wounds opened , but she resolutely held it in check . It was an unworthyemotion and solved nothing . She said to Lotte , " That shirt  --  is n't it Mister Richter 's ? " Lotte looked up . " Why , yes , Sister . " Before the conversation could be taken any further , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeared , a billycan in one hand . His head was bare , the blond hair and beard beaded with rain , and his yellow oilskin ran with water . He smiled as he placed the can on the table . " Hot tea , ladies . All the galley can manage at the moment . " " Is it bad up there , Mister Richter ? " Sister Angela asked . " Just another Atlantic gale , Sister , " he replied . " Nothing special to an old hand like you . " She smiled , in spite of herself , for it was hard not to . Lotte said , " Your shirt , Mister Richter , will be ready for you this evening . " " You 'll spoil me , Fraulein . " The Deutschland lurched so that he had to brace himself against the table . " I 'd better get back up there . That was n't too good . " He mounted the companionway and Lotte paused in her sewing . " He never stops . One would think at times that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The finest sailor , certainly , " Sister Angela said . She paused , then carried on , " A fine young man altogether . STORM W A R N I N G 103Has he told you much about himself ? " Lotte glanced up , her face coloring . " I only ask because Sister Kathe mentionedthat she had noticed you and Mister Richter enjoyinga lengthy conversation on deck yesterday evening . " Before the girl could reply , the ship staggered under anothermighty blow , swinging off course . There was a cry of alarm on deck , the doors at the head of the companionway burst open , and water cascaded in . Berger had the wheel with two seamen to help him as the Deutschland plowed on through a wilderness of white foam . In spite of their combined efforts , the ship was swinging a couple of points on each side of her course . Sturmm and Leading Seaman Knorr were attempting to reef the fore staysail and were having a hard time of it , for the sea constantly poured over the weather bulwark , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and yet again they had to stop work and simply hang on to prevent themselves from being swept away . Richter emerged from the companionway , closed the doors behind him , and turned to move toward the quarterdeckladder . An enormous wave raced in astern , towering into the rain as if intent on engulfing them . He cried a warning to Berger , pointing , but the wave broke full upon the poop , knocking the captain 's two companions from their feet . Richter grabbed for the weather-jigger rigging and held on . Water boiled around him as the wave passed , taking all before it , so that for a moment he believed she must certainlyfounder under all that weight . Slowly , the Deutschland started to rise and , as the water receded , he saw that there was now only Sturmm up there in the weather rigging by the fore staysail . Knorr floundered in the lee scuppers , trying to get to his feet . Richter started toward him as the Deutschland continued to climb , and then another great sea rolled in and knocked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edge of104 S T O R M W A R N I N G S T O R M W A R N I N G 105the main hatch cover and held on tight , but the same sea lifted Knorr over the rail . As Richter struggled to his feet , he caught a single flash of yellow out there that as quickly was gone . Sturmm started to work his way along the deck using the weather lines . Berger and his two companions were winningin their battle to control the wheel . Richter saw that the doors at the head of the companionway swung open . He stepped inside , closed them behind him , and went down . There was a foot of water in the saloon , and the other nuns had emerged from their cabins in some alarm to join Sister Angela and Lotte . " It 's all right , ladies , " Richter assured them . " Everythingis under control , but I would suggest you return to your cabins and strap yourselves into those bunks until the gale blows itself out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said briskly , " Mister Richter is right . ' We must all do as he says at once . " The other nuns retreated to their cabins , ankle-deep in water , skirts raised , but Lotte stayed , reaching up to touch the smear of blood on Richter 's right cheek . " You are hurt , Mister Richter . " " Nothing , " he said . " A scratch only . Please do as I say . " He turned to Sister Angela . " We lost a man overboard just now . Knorr . You can tell the others in your own good time . I did n't want to alarm them unnecessarily . " She crossed herself . " Was there nothing to be done ? " " In these seas ? He was swallowed whole . " The ship staggered again and he turned , swearing , brushed past Lotte , and went up the companionway fast . She reached out as if she would hold him back . " Helmut , " she whispered . She stood there , her skirts dragging in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to despair on her face . " He 'll kill himself , I know it . " Sister Angela said gently , " You like him , do n't you ? Like him a great deal , I mean ? " " Yes , Sister , " Lotte replied in a low voice . Sister Angela sat down at the table , her hands gripping the edge of the table . " My child , you must remember that we are members of an order whose vows urge us to love all our fellow creatures equally . The danger for us , in any kind of personal relationship , is that it detracts from what one is able to give to others . Our vow is to be servant to humanity , Lotte . " " I have taken no such vow , Sister . " Sister Angela braced herself against the table as the floor tilted again . She was slightly breathless now and not from any physical exertion . " Do you know what you are saying ? " " Yes , " Lotte replied , a new firmness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain of my vocation . " Sister Angela reached out , grasping the girl 's hands tightly . " Think well , Lotte , " she said urgently . " To give up God 's love for ... " " A man ? " Lotte asked . " Is it not possible then to have both ? " Sister Angela tried to stay calm , and yet that ancient bitternessfloated up again like bile . " Things are not always what they seem . Human beings are frail . Once , when I was even younger than you , I loved a man , gave him my heart , and , God help me , gave him my body also  --  and in return  --  " She choked on the words . " And in return ... " Lotte said gently , " And because one man acted so , all men are tainted ? Is this what you would have me believe , Sister ? " " No , " Sister Angela whispered . " Of course not . " She squeezed Lotte 's hand . " We 've talked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mister Richter ordered . He knows what is best for us . " Lotte hesitated , but did as she was told . The door to herlob S T O R M W A R N I N Gcabin clicked shut behind her . Sister Angela sat there at the table , her eyes vacant , staring into space . " Why , Karl ? " she whispered . " Why ? " And then , as hot tears stung her eyes , the iron discipline of the years came to her aid as always . She took a deep breath to steady herself , folded her hands , and started to pray for the repose of Leading Seaman Peter Knorr 's soul , for all sinners everywhere whose actions only cut them off from the infinite blessing of God 's love . Toward evening the gale abated , but it was still blowing very hard and , high above the deck , Helmut Richter , Sturmm , and Leading Seaman Kluth balanced on the yardarm , struggling to refit the freshly mended fore upper topsail . The rain , sweeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they punched the wet canvas , cursing as blood spurted from torn fingers . Berger stood gazing up at the men aloft , Otto Prager at his side in black oilskin and sou'wester . " It frightens me just to watch , " the consul said . " I 'd never get used to it , not if we sailed around the world and took a year over it . " " It certainly separates the men from the boys , " Berger told him as Sturmm and the others started to come down . The young lieutenant mounted to the quarterdeck . " All square up there now , Kapitan . " His face was pale and drawn , the memory of Knorr still with him . Berger said , " Do n't blame yourself , boy . There was nothing to be done . " " I almost had him , " Sturmm said . " Then he slipped from my grasp . " Berger put a hand on his shoulder , " Get yourself some coffee . " Sturmm went down the ladder . Berger looked over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Bad ? " he called . " Fingertip , that 's all . " STORM W A R N I N G 107 " See Sister Angela . She 'll fix you up . " When the bosun went down the companionway , the saloonwas deserted except for Lotte , who sat at the table , a book open before her . She glanced up at the sound of his foot on the stair and she smiled . " Mister Richter . " " Fraulein . " For some reason lately he found it impossible to call her Sister . " You should be in your bunk . " She reached for his damaged hand and started to unwrap the handkerchief . " What have you done ? " " It 's nothing , " he said . " A split finger , that 's all . Punchingcanvas . It happens all the time . " The end of the middle finger was open to the bone . " You must let me do something . " " I 'll see to it . " Sister Angela spoke from behind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set you . In your cabin , " she added . Lotte colored , picked up her book , and went out quickly . It was very quiet in the saloon , the voice of the wind outsidesubdued , far away . Richter and Sister Angela confrontedeach other . " I 'll get my medical case . " He sat at the table and lit a cigarette . " You do n't mind ? " he asked when she turned . " Your smoking ? Oh , no , Mister Richter . My father used to say a man should have some vices . Of the right kind , that is . " " A short leash , you mean ? " " Do I ? " She examined the finger . " This will need two stitches . You 'd better look the other way . " He drew on his cigarette , watching the door to Lotte 's cabin , grunting a little as the needle entered the flesh . " Where are you from , Mister Richter ? " " Vienna . " She was surprised . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such things . What did you do , run away to sea ? " Io8 S T O R M W A R N I N G " Strangely enough , that 's exactly what I did , " Richter told her . " My father , if you are interested , was a surgeon , and had a similar career mapped out for me . " " And you had other ideas . Are you married ? " " No , " he said evenly . The needle was inserted again . " You should be . It 's good for the soul , Mister Richter . There , I 've finished . " " How strange , " he said . " I 'd always understood it was good for the flesh . " She kept her temper and contented herself with saying calmly , " Leave her alone . She has better things to do with her life . " " Why , because that was the way it worked out for you ? " She stood abruptly , picked up the medical case , and went into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As he got up , Lotte 's door clicked open . " Are you all right now , Mister Richter ? " she whispered . " Fine , " he said . " In fact , I 've never felt better , Fraulein . " " That 's all right , then . " She smiled again and withdrew . Richter went up the companionway steps two at a time . For Paul Gericke things progressed with extraordinary rapidity . A preliminary interrogation at Falmouth during which his own clothes had been dried , then returned to him . He had then been moved by road to Portsmouth , where he had found himself in the hands of naval intelligence . They had treated him with respect . He was , after all , something of a catch for them  --  the most important U-boat commander to be captured since Kretschmer . For five straight hours they had interrogated him in shifts , but with a total lack of success . Gericke had resolutelystuck to the personal information required under the Geneva Convention , and nothing more . Just after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 109moved to London . He was transferred in a naval police van , handcuffed and escorted by a petty officer , two ratings , and a sub-lieutenant , all armed . And so it was that at four-thirty in the afternoon he was in the London District POW Cage , a requisitioned house in Kensington Palace Gardens . This time the treatment was n't so good , particularly from the chief petty officer who took charge of him on arrival , a massively built man of forty-six named Carver , with the broken nose of a boxer . " If I had my way , son , " he informed Gericke , " there 's nothing I 'd fancy more than getting you inside a ring for six straight rounds , and I 'd make sure you 'd last right up to the final bell . " " Oh , I do n't know , Chief , " Gericke told him calmly . " I should have thought you would have been at your best up a dark alley with a bottle in your hand . " For a moment he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were two ratings present in reception . The chief petty officer , shaking with rage , contented himself with stripping Gericke of his decorations . The room to which he was finally taken was pleasant enough . More like a study than an office , books lining the wall , a fire in the grate , and , although the tall window was heavily barred , there was a view of the garden outside . He was placed in a chair on one side of a wide desk , still handcuffed , and waited impassively for whatever was to come , an armed rating on either side of him . After a while , the door opened . The man who walked around to the other side of the desk was a full captain in the Royal Navy . He had a DSO and ribbons for the First World War  --  Gericke took that in automatically , along with the iron-gray hair and pale aesthetic face . He had a bad limp and leaned heavily on an ebony walking stick . He placed a couple of manila folders on the desk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name is Vaughan . " " I wish I could say I was happy to meet you . " 110 S T O R M W A R N I N G S T O R M W A R N I N G 111Vaughan nodded to one of the ratings . " You can take the handcuffs off now , then wait outside . " He waited for them to comply with his order and only sat down as the door clicked shut behind them . Gericke eased his cramped wrists . " Thank you . They were beginning to be rather uncomfortable . " " Cigarette ? " Vaughan pushed a box across the table . " Your English is really quite excellent , but then you did live over here for a couple of years , did n't you ? " He opened one of the folders and put on a pair of half-moon reading glasses . " Nineteen twenty-six to twenty-eight . Hull . You went to grammar school there . " " You seem to know . " " Yes , I do , Commander , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice . " Everything about you . An excellentrecord by the way . I congratulate you . " Gericke restrained an impulse to laugh . " Of course . " " Not only the Knight 's Cross , but the Oak Leaves to go with it . A rare distinction . " " It was . " " Why do you say that ? " Gericke opened his leather jerkin to indicate the tunic underneath , bare of decorations . " The spoils of war . " For the first time , Vaughan showed emotion . A tiny muscle twitched in his right cheek . " Your decorations were taken from you ? " " Yes . " " In this establishment ? You will be good enough to tell me by whom . " " The chief petty officer in charge of reception , " Gericke said , and added maliciously , " I had assumed it to be the normal run of things . " " Not while I am in charge here , I can assure you , Commander . " Vaughan 's face was white and pinched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the desk . " Send Chief Petty Officer Carver up to twenty-two at once . " He got to his feet and stumped across to the window , leaning on his cane . There was a knock at the door a moment later and Carver entered . " You wanted me , sir ? " Vaughan spoke without turning around . " Carver , I understand you have in your possession certain decorations belonging to this officer . " " Sir ? " Carver started to bluster . Vaughan swung around to face him . " Damn your eyes , man , get them out on the table . Now ! " Carver hurriedly produced Gericke 's Knight 's Cross , Iron Cross First Class , and wound badge and laid them on the desk . " Is that the lot ? " Vaughan asked Gericke . Gericke nodded . Vaughan said to Carver harshly , " I 'll deal with you later . Get out . " As the door closed behind Carver , Gericke picked up the medals and put them in his pocket . Vaughan sat down , took a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the file again . " As I was saying , quite a record . Let 's see now . You joined the Tenth Flotilla at Brest after your return from the Far East , did n't you ? " " I 've told you who I am ; that 's all that 's required of me . I 'm sorry , Captain Vaughan , I have nothing else to say . " " All right , " Vaughan said . " You compel me to become unpleasant . You really leave me no other choice . " " Bring on the rubber hoses by all means . But it wo n't change anything . " Vaughan was annoyed . " We 're not the Gestapo . We do n't operate that way . " " Then I shall be even more fascinated to hear your proposal , " Gericke assured him . Vaughan opened the second folder . " On the fifth of April , 1942 , you sank , in American waters near Rhode Island , an oil tanker named the San Cristobal . " " Perfectly correct . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I N G " You are aware , of course , that this ship was a Spanish vessel registered in Bilbao and that to torpedo and sink her was contrary to the articles of war ? " " You do n't say . " " But I do , and what is more to the point , our American friends intend to make you answer for it . As a courtesy , American Naval Intelligence was informed of your capture this morning . Within two hours they 'd made a formal applicationto take you into custody . From what I hear , they intend to ship you to the United States to stand trial . " Gericke laughed . " What nonsense . The San Cristobal was under charter to carry oil for the American War De-partment . " " There 's no mention of that fact here . " " Strange  --  the rest of your information seems to have been so uniformly accurate . " Vaughan shrugged . " The Americans have asked for you , Gericke ; that is fact , and the consequences if they do tryyou @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But you could save me from all that ? " " If you were willing to cooperate . " Gericke sighed . " Sorry , but you really are wasting your time . " Vaughan nodded calmly , put the manila folder under his arm , got up , and limped out without another word . Left alone , Gericke , on impulse , pinned the Iron Cross and wound badge to his tunic and hung the Knight 's Cross around his neck . Then he stood at the window and looked out through the bars . The garden was enclosed by a high wall and was badly overgrown . Rain drifted down through the branches of a large beech tree into a wilderness of rhododendrons . It was a melancholy sight . The door opened behind him and Carver entered , followed by a rating carrying a covered tray . " Put it down there , lad , " Carver ordered and added to Gericke , " Somethingto eat , Commander ? " S T O R M W A R N I N G 113The rating withdrew and Gericke walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the front of the tunic . The eyes were cold . " I 'm going to have you , you German bastard , you see if I do n't , " he whispered . He hurled Gericke back into Vaughan 's chair and hurriedly left the room . Just after seven on the same evening , Janet Munro and Harry Jago arrived by taxi at the house in Kensington PalaceGardens . They went up the steps to the front door , which was guarded by two sentries , and into the entrance hall , where an Army Intelligence Corps sergeant sat at a trestle table . Jago produced his pass . " Lieutenant Jago . I 'm supposed to report to a Captain Vaughan . " " Oh , yes , sir , he 's expecting you . I 'll get someone to take you up . " The sergeant pressed a buzzer and Jago said , " Okay if the lady waits for me here ? " " I do n't see why not , sir . " Jago turned to Janet . " Sorry about this . Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Naval captain in the first place , God only knows . Let 's hope it does n't take long and we can get straight to the theater . " She patted his cheek . " How could this mighty war machineof ours roll on without you ? " Before Jago could think of a suitable reply , a young ATS corporal appeared to escort him to Vaughan . Janet sat on a chair by the window , crossing one leg over the other in a manner that filled the intelligence sergeant at his desk with admiration . " Not too bad today then , miss , " he ventured . " Three in Hackney , two down Poplar way , and one in Golders Green . " " And that 's good ? " she said . The flying bombs , the V-1 variety , had been bad enough , the grating roar of their engines growing steadily louder as they approached , but at least you knew they were coming . With the V-z rockets , on the other hand , there was no warning : a supersonic bang , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A door on the far side of the hall opened and Gericke came through , flanked by two armed ratings . His hands were handcuffed in front of him , but he made a striking figure in the white naval cap with the Iron Cross on his tunic , the Knight 's Cross around his neck . He did n't appear to notice Janet , his head half turned , laughing at something one of the guards had said , and they went up the stairs and disappeared from view . The desk sergeant said , " Jerry prisoner , miss . Naval officer . We get a lot of them through here . " " Oh , I see . " She stood up , crossed the hall , and stood in the porch at the top of the steps . There was a staccato roaring high above in the darkness , and she glanced up to see a V-i passing across the night sky , a short jet of flame sprouting from its tail . " I wonder where that bastard will come down , " the sentrysaid beside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the men responsible . The enemy . It was the closest she 'd been to a German since before the war . For a moment , she saw Gericke again , laughing as he went up the stairs between the guards , and was conscious of a kind of anger . Jago emerged behind her and took her arm . " Okay , let 's get out of here . " They went down the steps and turned along the pavement . " And what was all that about ? " " Well , I do n't see why I should n't tell you . The British picked up a German U-boat commander last night , one of the really top boys . A guy named Paul Gericke . They 've had him in here for interrogation . It seems they 're giving114 S T O R M W A R N I N GS T O R M W A R N I N G 115him to us . He 's being sent up to Glasgow on the night expresstomorrow evening . He 'll be handed over to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States three or four days from now . " " And where do you come into it ? " " Well , he 'll have a British escort , but some bright boy at naval headquarters remembered I was traveling on that train and decided it would be a good idea if I kept an eye out for our interests . " " Did you meet him ? " " Just now . " " Was he medium height  --  pale face , dark eyes , Iron Cross on his tunic ? " " That 's our boy . " " He was laughing as he went up the stairs , " she said . At that moment they were passing behind a row of halfdemolishedhouses . " He was laughing . He and his kind caused all this . " " They tell me Berlin does n't look too hot these days . " She slipped an arm through his . " You 're not for real , Harry Jago . By the way , I did n't get a chance to tell you , but Colonel Brisingham turned up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night 's train . " Jago was over the moon with delight . " That means we can be together all the way to Mallaig . " " I 'm not so sure , " she said . " Actually they 've provided me with a sleeping compartment . A single berth all to my-self . " " They 've what ? " Jago said in astonishment . " Have you any idea what it takes to get one of those things these days ? " " Yes , " she said . " Eisenhower . " Jago laughed . The rain increased , and they ran across to the corner of the main road . She sheltered under a tree while he tried to whistle up a cab. 116 S T O R M W A R N I N GAnd as she waited , for some reason , she kept seeing Gericke 's face , laughing as he went upstairs . The clock in the chart house chimed seven bells of the first watch . Seated at his desk in the cabin , a cigar between his teeth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ journal , the scratching of his pen sounding unnaturally loud in the silence. ... the loneliest sound in the world , a ship 's bell at sea by night , or is it that it simply accentuates for me the loneliness of command ? I think to be a ship 's master no simple task , especially in the conditions under which I find myself at the moment ... . There was a knock on the door and Sturmm entered in a flurry of rain . He wore black oilskins and a sou'wester , and water glistened on him in the light of the oil lamp . " Well , Mister Sturmm ? " Berger said . Sturmm saluted . " I 've just made the rounds , sir . Everythingnice and tight . Kluth and Weber have the wheel at present . Heading northwest by west at ten knots by estima-tion . " " Full sail ? " " Every stitch she can carry . " " And what about the weather ? " " Wind force five with heavy rain , but it 's surprisingly warm . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rum bottle and two glasses . " How long were you operating the radio yesterday ? " Sturmm accepted the glass gratefully . " An hour and a half exactly . " " What about the batteries ? " " Not too good , sir , but then they never were . It 's not much of a set . The best Herr Prager could manage at shortS T O R M W A R N I N G 117notice I know . Still ! " He hesitated . " Do you want me to stop listening in , sir ? " " No , I do n't think so . Those British and American weather reports are too useful , and the war news . But it 's when we 're close to home and wanting to transmit that we 're going to need the power . I want to be sure we have enough in reserve . " " Shall I leave it for tonight ? " " Half an hour , " Berger said . " When you go off watch . I think that should suffice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drained the last of his rum with reluctance . " If you 'll excuse me , I 'd better get back on the quarterdeck . " He turned and put his hand to the door  --  and from somewhere outside came the agonized cry of a woman . It was hot below and very close . T'o Lotte , this voyage seemed interminable . From nowhere to nowhere . There was a gentle and continuous snoring from beneath her . Sister Angela had moved Sister Else into the cabin without any explanation . Lotte lay on the top bunk , the roof no more than two feet above her face , hot and uncomfortable in spite of the fact that she was wearing only a linen nightdress . She was thinking of Helmut Richter , concentrating with an intensitythat was almost frightening , trying to conjure him up from the darkness  --  the slow smile , the wild blond hair and beard . Lotte was a quiet , self-contained girl . Most of her life had been totally enclosed  --  first by the demands of a rigidly orthodox Catholic family , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afterward , the Order of the Sisters of Mercy . Nothing more demanding than God . She had learned to live within herself . But Richter  --  Richter was something different , a totally new experience . When she thought of him , she smiled spontaneously. 118 S T O R M W A R N I N G S T O R M W A R N I N G 119Her body was damp with sweat . It was impossible for her to stay in that cabin another minute . She needed air  --  clean salt air . She dropped to the floor softly , reached for her cloak , and slipped outside . Lightning flickered on the far horizon , moving nearer . There was an eerie phosphorescence to everything , so that the ship was a place of darkness and light , warm rain driftingacross the deck in a silvery haze . Kluth leaned on the wheel , his foot against the binnacle , thoroughly enjoying himself as the Deutschland stormed on through the night , every sail full . Weber leaned on the rail beside him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companionway . But Ernst Walz , making himself coffee in the galley , saw her . The girl kept to the shadows by the port rail and paused at the mizzen shrouds , head lifted to feel the rain . She moved away from the rail , and as she passed the galleyentrance , Walz reached out and caught her around the waist . Lotte was not certain what was happening . From surpriseas much as fear she cried out  --  a sharp cry of terror that sounded clearly above the wind and rain . Helmut Richter , asleep in one of the hammocks that had been rigged in the forecastle to take care of the extra crew , was awake in an instant , was up the ladder and out on deck before Berger and Sturmm had even emerged from the captain 's cabin . Lotte staggered across the deck , losing her balance as the ship heeled , and falling at Richter 's feet . As he picked her up , the cloak fell back from her shoulders . Sister Angela emerged from the companionway . " Lotte ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side and took a pace forward to stand waiting as Walz came hesitantly from the galley . " Walz ! " Richter said softly . He stood there , bare feet apart , dressed only in seaman'sdenims . Lightning flickered overhead as the storm moved in . St. Elmo 's fire flared at each masthead , so that the entireship seemed to glow as it plunged forward . " Richter ! " Berger cried . The bosun ignored him and moved forward . Walz terrified , sprang into the ratlines and started to climb the foremast . Richter went after him , picking his way with care as if he had all the time in the world . Walz moved with remarkable speed . When he reached the lower topsail yard , he paused to look down , then drew the knife at his belt and slashed at the ratlines . Lotte cried out . There was a sudden groan from the assembled crew , followed by total silence as they held their breath . The ratlines parted and Richter reached for the downhaulnearest to hand , swinging from it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He hung there for a moment before starting upward again . Walz , holding on to the yard , waited for him , reachingdown to slash at the bosun 's hand with the knife . Richter twisted out of the way , but Walz kicked him in the side of the face . Richter slipped several feet down the line , then came to a halt , spinning around . Lotte stared up , her knuckles tight against her teeth . Sturmm took a step forward . Berger grabbed his arm . " Leave it ! " he said in a low voice . " In God 's name , Herr Kapitan , " Sister Angela said . " Do something . " " What would you suggest , Sister ? " Berger asked , without taking his gaze away from the scene above for a moment . It was an extraordinary sight , with sheet lightning explodingfrom one horizon to the other , the strange ball of light of the St. Elmo 's fire pulsating at each masthead , the eerie phosphorescence of the electrical discharge flowing along every rope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darkness with total clarity. 120 S T O R M W A R N I N GWith an incredible effort , the bosun went up the line hand over hand , grabbed for the lower topsail yard , and a moment later was secure in the footropes . Walz backed away and started upward again , climbing toward the upper topsail yard . Each flash of lightning had a dazzling white intensity to it that seemed to imprint the scene on the brain for those on deck , but in between was a brief interval of total darkness so that they might have been looking through the eyeholes of an old-fashioned moving picture machine , the action moving jerkily forward , scene by scene . As Walz reached the yard , the bosun swung to one side on a lift , pulled himself up to a position on the extreme end of the yardarm , and began inching along the footropes . Walz backed away , out toward the other end of the yardarm . Richter was very close now . He hung there no more than three feet away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knife caught the bosun 's right cheek . He came forward implacably and Walz gave a cry of despair . He grabbed for the main upper topsail brace and slashed at it in a frenzy with the knife . The line parted and the yardarm , freed from restraint , swung viciously from one side to the other , the sail flapping as air spilled from it . Richter should have been hurled into space , but he managed to scramble to the temporary safety of the lower topgallantyard . Walz swung crazily backward and forward . A particularlywild roll of the Deutschland sent him half over the yard , and he only managed to save himself by hooking an arm in the footrope . Richter worked his way across the back of the lower topgallantfrom one lift to another . He paused , suspended in space , watching carefully , judging his moment , as Walz , on the end of the yardarm , swung far out over the sea . The ship heeled , Walz swung in very fast , hanging on with one arm , striking with the knife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ W A R N I N G 121each hand , gave him both feet in the face . Walz cried out and went back over the yard into space . He hit the water some distance from the starboard rail . His arm swung up in mute appeal , but in spite of the wildly flailing sail , the Deutschland was still making ten knots , and he receded , became one with the night , taken by the sea . " We 're heaving to , Mister Sturmm . Douse jibs , if you please . Clew up forecourse , topsails , and t'gallants , then get to work and repair that damage . I want to be under way again in an hour , " Berger ordered . " Is that all you have to say ? " Sister Angela 's voice was low , intense . " A man is dead . " " It shall be so noted in the log , " Berger said impassively . Richter dropped to the deck and Lotte ran forward , arms outstretched . When she was a yard or two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caught her quickly . He stood there for a moment looking down at her , blood oozing from his slashed cheek , then went toward the companionway . The other nuns , gathered together at the bottom , got out of the way quickly . Sister Kathe said , " Is she all right , Mister Richter ? " Richter did n't reply . He walked across the saloon to Lotte 's cabin , went in , and laid her on the lower bunk . He reached for a blanket to cover her and the girl 's eyes fluttered . For a second only she stared blankly into space , then recognized him . " Mister Richter ? " " It 's all right , " Richter said . He made a movement as if to turn away and there was instant panic . " Do n't leave me . " He took her hand and crouched beside the bunk , strokingher forehead as one might gentle a child . " Never , " he said softly . " Never again . Sleep now . " She closed her eyes , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ T O R M W A R N I N Gthe breathing became slow and regular , the hand slackened in his . He got to his feet and turned to find the nuns peering in at the doorway , a uniform look of astonishment on their faces in the dim light . Sister Angela stood at the foot of the bed , pale and composed , hands folded . He waited for her comment , drained of emotion , quite indifferent , and as always , she surprised him . " And now , I think you 'd better come with me , Mister Richter , " she said calmly . " From the looks of things , I 'd say you need another stitch or two . " In the gray light of dawn far to the northeast , U-235 surfacedat the rendezvous buoy a mile off Bergen . She presentedan extraordinary sight , for in place of her prow there was only a jagged stump of twisted , rusting metal . In midChannelit had soon been discovered that eight meters of the forecastle were bent to one side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alternating as rapidly as possible between full speed ahead and full speed back . But the rest of the trip had been an unqualified nightmare . He had not closed his eyes in thirty-six hours , and when he followed Engel up the ladder to the bridge , it was very slowly indeed . An escort of two armed trawlers raced out to meet them , signal lamps flashing . Engel examined them through his binoculars , then turned . His face was gray , the eyes dark , no life there at all . The bandage around his forehead did n't help the general appearance . " We made it , Herr Admiral . " " So it would appear . " A seaman came up the ladder behind them quickly and passed a flimsy across . " Signal , sir . " He offered it to Friemel who shook his head . " You read , " he said to Engel . " WELL DONE , OTTO . DONITZ , HIGH COMMANDER OF THEKRIEGSMARINE AND BDU , " Engel said in a low voice . " That 's all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Friemel laughed harshly . " Well done in-deed . " There was a further flurry of activity as the minesweeperscircled to take up position , men cheering from the rails as U-235 plowed forward slowly . From somewhere below there was a cry , a muffled cheer , feet scrambling on the iron ladder , and Heini Roth erupted onto the bridge , another flimsy in his hand . His face was white with excitement . " What is it , for God 's sake ? " Friemelasked . " Further signal from BdU , Herr Admiral . It simply says : INFORMATION FROM ABWEHR THAT GERICKE ARRIVED LONDON CAGE ON THE NINETEENTH . " He turned , leaned heavily on the rail , totally overcome . Friemel took a crumpled cigarette pack from his breast pocket . There was one cigarette left , which he carefully insertedinto his holder . Heini gave him a light , hand shaking . Friemel inhaled deeply , then sighed . " The last of those lousy French weeds , and yet I do n't think a cigarette ever tasted better in my life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 46  --  55'N , long . 17  --  58'W . Another bad night . Wind force 7 . Rain and heavy seas . At four bells of the morning watch outer jib parted at the clew and jibboom ripped away when a huge sea came up to windward . Kluth and Schmidt who had jumped to the mizzen pipe-rail were hurled into the lee scuppers . I expected to see them swept away , but by some miracle they survived , Schmidt sustaining a fracture of the left forearm . As it was imper- ative to go about with such a sea running , I decided to wear ship to give Mister Sturmm a chance to repair dam- age . At two bells of the forenoon watch , Obersteuer- mann Richter reported eighteen inches of water in the bilges . I immediately ordered him to call the starboard watch from below and to commence pumping . It was two bells of the first dogwatch before Mister Sturmm was able to report all damage secure . Obersteuermann Richter 's watch having pumped her dry again and the storm having abated a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our original course , having lost some forty miles as we drifted to leeward . I estimate we are now some seven hundred miles due west of the Bay of Biscay . SevenIt was considered useful propaganda to let the public see German prisoners of war being led through Euston station . Sublieutenant Fisher was in charge of the escort , which consisted of Carver and two leading seamen , Wright and Hardisty . They all wore gaiters and webbing belts , car-126 S T O R M W A R N I N Grying Webley .38 revolvers like any normal shore patrol , but they took Gericke through the crowd as unobtrusively as possible , just another naval prisoner , a blue raincoat draped over his shoulders . Fisher identified himself to the guard , who led them into a luggage van . The rear section was walled off by a metal grille , behind which lay a jumble of red GPO bags . The guard produced a key . " He can go in there if you like . " " Fine , " Fisher said . " Can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why not , " the guard said . " I 've got a spare . I do n't suppose you 're likely to steal the mail . " He went out . Fisher unlocked the iron gate and Carver nodded to Gericke , scrupulously polite . " If you do n't mind , sir . " Gericke moved inside , the sublieutenant locked the gate , and handed the key to Carver . " Right , Chief . You look after things here while I see if I can find Lieutenant Jago . " " You take your time , sir . ' We 'll be fine in here , " Carver told him . " A damn sight better off than they are further up the train . " Fisher went out and Carver passed a pound note across to Leading Seaman Hardisty . " You and your mate cut along to the station buffet and grab what you can in the way of sandwiches and fags . " " But we 've brought a load of stuff with us from the canteen , Chief , " Hardisty told him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Carver said . " Which is fine , till we roll into Leeds or somewhere like it at two in the bloody morning and find the cupboard 's bare . Now do as I say . " Gericke leaned against the metal grille and examined anotice on the wall . It said : IF AN AIR RAID OCCURS WHILEYOU ARE ON THE TRAIN : 1 . Do not attempt to leave unless required by the guard to do so . You are safer where you are . STORM WARNING 127 Pull the blinds down , both by day and night , as a protection against flying glass . If room is available , lie down on the floor . Carver said , " Thanks to you buggers , that little lot . " " Tell me something , Chief Petty Officer , " Gericke asked , " how long have you been in the service ? " " Thirty years . Joined up in 1914 when I was sixteen . " " Ah , a regular , " Gericke nodded . " You surprise me . War , after all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yet you seem to object to the fact that there 's one on . Per- haps the only reason you stayed on after the first lot was to wear a pretty uniform and have a girl in every port . " Carver was furiously angry . " You wait , you bastard . " They heard Fisher 's voice approaching . The sublieu- tenant entered , followed by Captain Vaughan and Harry Jago , to find Carver passing a cigarette through the mesh to Gericke . " Care for a smoke , Commander ? " he was asking with perfect civility . " That 's very kind of you , Chief . " Gericke accepted the cigarette and a light . Vaughan said , " A little primitive , but it could be worse . Any complaints , Commander ? " Gericke raised his handcuffed wrists . " Could I possibly have these removed ? After all , I am caged in . " " Sorry . " Vaughan shook his head . " But if it makes you feel any better , we had an intelligence report in from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It seems U-235 , under the command of Rear Admiral Otto Friemel , arrived safely , minus seven or eight meters of her bow . " For a moment Gericke could n't take it in , but in any case there was no time to say anything , for outside the guard 's whistle blew , and there was the sound of running feet. 128 STORM WARNINGVaughan said stiffly , in that careful , precise voice , " Well , Commander , I can only wish you a safe voyage , in spite of the exigencies of the North Atlantic . " Gericke smiled . " Ironic to find myself in the periscope sights of an old comrade . " Vaughan saluted , beckoned to Fisher , and limped out on the platform . Jago said to Gericke , " I 'll look in from time to time . It can take twelve hours or more to make Glasgow . " " I 'm in no particular hurry . " Jago went out and Carver moved across to the grille . " And neither am I , son , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let 's have those medals back . " On Fhada , rain blew in across the harbor and drummed against the windows of the old cottage . Reeve was seated at his desk , his diary open before him . His daily entry was an old habit , engaged in from his earliest days at sea . Not so much a record of events as an attempt to formulate his thoughts . He put a match to his pipe , picked up his pen , and started to write . This life of mine , if life I can call it , has become a strange affair , a kind of metamorphosis in which every- thing has changed . Oliver Wendell Holmes once said that it was required of a man that he should share the action and passion of his times at peril of being judged not to have lived , and for most of my life I have fol- lowed his precept with uncommon faithfulness . But now I find myself caught in a web of days , time passing in a kind of slow motion , and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pen and stirred the wolfhound , sprawled on the rug before the hearth , with his foot . " Out of the way , you red devil . " Rory moved reluctantly and Reeve added a few turfs to the peat fire , then glanced at his watch . " Almost time , S T O R M W A R N I N G 129Rory . Shall we see if they 've anything for us today , eh ? Maybe someone out there will actually remember that we still exist . " The radio was on a table by the window . He sat down , adjusted the headphones , and started to transmit . " This is Sugar One on Fhada calling Mallaig . Are you receiving me ? " Rory crouched beside him and Reeve fondled the dog 's ears and tried again . There was an almost instantaneous response . " Hello , Sugar One , this is Mallaig receiving you loud and clear . Stand by , please . I have a message for you . " Reeve was aware of a sudden excitement . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What can I do for you ? " Reeve demanded . " Had a signal from London for you , sir . Just to let you know that your niece is on her way to stay with you for a few days . " Reeve said automatically , " That 's wonderful . When does she arrive ? " " Sometime tomorrow . I ca n't be more exact than that , I 'm afraid . You know what the trains are like these days . What about transportation to Fhada , sir ? I do n't think I 'll have anything official available . " " That 's all right , " Reeve said . " I 'll see to that end of things . " He braced himself . " Anything else for me , Mur-ray ? " " I 'm afraid not , sir , " Murray said , and added , " I 'm sorry , Admiral . " " Do n't be , " Reeve said bitterly . " I do n't think anyone else is , so why should you be different ? Over and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staring into space , one hand idly playing with Rory 's ears . It would be nice to see Janet again , to hear her news , but it was n't enough . Not nearly enough . The dog whined as his hands gripped too tightly , and he stood up quickly . " Sorry , boy . I 'm not at my best today . Let 's get a little fresh air . " 130 S T O R M W A R N I N G S T O R M W A R N I N G 131He took down his reefer from behind the door and went out , Rory at his heels . The wind was in the wrong direction to use a sail so he hand-pumped his way on one of the trolleysfor the entire length of the line to South Inlet . When he went down to the lifeboat station , the rear door of the boathouse was open . Murdoch was sitting on an old chair , sheltered from the rain , mending a net across his knee . He looked up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working . " A good day or a bad day , Carey Reeve ? " " Since when have I had a choice ? " " Like that , is it ? Would you care for a dram ? " " Maybe later . My niece is arriving at Mallaig tomorrow on the London train . " " That will be nice for you . " Murdoch spread his net . " Young Lachlan MacBrayne is coming home on leave off that same train . His mother told me yesterday . " " A paratrooper , is n't he ? " " That is so . If you 've no objection , I 've promised to run across in your Katrina and pick him up . You would like me to bring your niece back also ? " " That would be fine , " Reeve said . On the train , Gericke sprawled back on the mail sacks , eyes closed , apparently asleep . Carver and the two leading seamenwere playing cards . Fisher was reading a book . There was a knock on the door , and when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Everything okay ? " " I think so , " Fisher said . They walked across to the wire mesh screen . " He 's been asleep for the past hour . " " Fine . If you 've got time I 'd like you to come up to the sleeping car and meet Dr. Munro . There 's a bottle of Scotch in my bag we could do a little damage to . " " Sounds good to me , " Fisher said as they went out . Carver lit a cigarette and scratched himself . " They 've got it made , these bloody Yanks . " " How 's that , Chief ? " Hardisty asked . " This Dr. Munro . A nice bit of skirt , I can tell you , going all the way to Mallaig . Her uncle 's an American admiralliving on some island in the Outer Hebrides . She 's got a private berth up there in the sleeping car . Jago 's shacked up with her . " He threw in his cards . " Another lousy bloody hand . Deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give me some good ones this time . " He got up and stared through the mesh at Gericke . " You awake , Commander ? " Gericke made no sign , breathing softly , eyes closed , and Hardisty said , " Leave him , Chief , for Christ 's sake . He is n't going anywhere . " Carver turned away reluctantly , sat down , and picked up his cards . Behind him , Gericke 's eyes opened for a brief moment . It was raining in Trondheim , heavy , drenching rain as Horst Necker went up the steps of the main entrance to the operations building with Rudi Hubner . They were still in flying gear , having just returned from an eight-hour operationalflight that had taken them far out into the Barents Sea and back again . Necker was tired and bad-tempered . " They 'll have to do something about that port engine . It sounds more like a bloody tractor every time we go out . " " I know , Herr Hauptmann , " Rudi said soothingly . " I spoke to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next furlough . " " Christ Almighty , we could be dead by then . " He pushed open the door of the intelligence room , expecting to find Altrogge , the intelligence officer , but he pulled up short , for Colonel Meyer , the Gruppenkommandeur , was sitting on the edge of the desk , smoking a cigarette and leafing through some papers . He glanced up . " You do n't look too pleased with life , Horst . Did you have trouble ? " 132 S T O R M W A R N I N G " You could say that . " Necker dropped his parachute on a convenient chair and accepted a cigarette . " Eight hours of nothing but bloody sea and a port engine with asthma . Otherwise the flight was sheer delight . " Meyer grinned . " Never mind . I 've brought your two-day furlough forward . That should please you . " " Why should it ? " Necker demanded sourly . " You 'll have a damn good reason , I 'm sure . " " A change of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the west coast of Scotland and the Hebridesagain for the next couple of weeks . " He smiled . " You wanted action , Horst . You 've got it . Two new Spitfire squadrons moved up to the east coast this week . That should make it interesting for you . " " Thanks very much , " Necker said , suddenly feeling surprisinglycheerful considering the circumstances . " What 's it all about ? " " Convoys from Canada have been using the northern run lately , according to intelligence . Coming up a lot closer to Iceland . From now on your patrol must take you much further out into the Atlantic . At least five hundred miles west of the Outer Hebrides . " " We wo n't be able to stay there long . " Meyer pulled a chart across the desk and nodded . " We 'll give you improved drop tanks . That should add anotherfive hundred miles . And there 's a modification to your GMI system that should make it possible for you to cross Scotland without dropping below thirty-five thousand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . In any case , it should keep you out of the way of those Spitfires . " The GMI system employed nitrous oxide , which was injectedinto the superchargers where , during high altitude flights , it supplied additional oxygen for combustion , increasingthe engine power by twenty percent . Necker examined the chart and nodded . " That 's a long way to go . " S T O R M W A R N I N G 133Meyer smiled and slapped him on the arm . " It will seem shorter when you 've had a couple of days ' rest . " The wind dropped considerably toward evening and the Deutschland , under full sail , moved on into the gathering darkness , pushed by a light breeze from the southwest . Richter had the first watch , alone on the quarterdeck except for a petty officer torpedo mechanic named Endrass , who was at the wheel . The bosun stood at the rail smoking one of his cigarillos , enjoying the night , the horned moon , and the stars scattered to the far horizon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At nine o'clock he went forward to speak with the lookoutin the bows . On his way back he paused by the mizzen shrouds on the port side to check a lashing that had worked loose on the mainsail boom . There was a movementbehind him , and Lotte stepped out of the shadows between the lifeboats . " Helmut ! " Her hands reached out through the darkness , her face a pale blur . Richter took them instinctively . " Lotte  --  what are you doing here ? " " I 've been watching you for the past half hour , pacing from one side to the other of that wretched quarterdeck . I was beginning to think you were never coming down . " " You must return below , " he said . " At once . " 4CWh  --  f " Because Sister Angela is concerned for your welfare . I 've given my word to the Kapitan that I 'll stay away from you for the rest of the voyage . " " And you ? " she said . " Are you concerned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He tried to release his hands . " Let be , Lotte . I 've given my word  --  do n't you see ? " " I understand only one thing , " she said . " That all my life I have been afraid . But when I am with you . . . " HerS T O R M W A R N I N G 135Berger was at his desk , writing . Otto Prager lay on the bunk reading a book . The consul sat up , swinging his legs to the floor , and Berger laid down his pen . " Sister ? " he said politely . Prager stood up . " You would like me to leave perhaps ? " He took a step toward the door , but she shook her head . " A moment of your time only , Kapitan . In the matter of Mister Richter and Lotte . " " Well ? " Berger asked bleakly , ready for trouble . " I would be obliged if you would release him from his promise not to speak to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather surprising change of attitude on your part , would n't you say ? " " A new viewpoint , perhaps . All I have ever wanted was what was right for Lotte . Her decision as to her future when we reach Kiel must be made of her own free choice with no voice to aid her but God 's . I see that now . In the meantime , it would seem pointless to keep her and Mister Richter apart artificially . As I have discovered for myself , he seems a singularly honorable young man . " Berger could n't think of a thing to say . She gave him a moment , then added , " And now , if you gentlemen will excuseme . I 'm really very tired . " The door closed behind her . The consul turned , total astonishmenton his face . Berger , without a word , opened the cupboard and took out the rum bottle and two glasses . It was very dark as the train plowed on into the night , rain lashing against the windows . When Harry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went in , Janet was in the single bunk , a blanket pulled up to her chin . " I 'm freezing . " " Well , I could suggest a remedy for that condition , " he told her cheerfully . " Not tonight , darling . I 've had it . I could sleep for a week . You 'll have to make do with the floor and a blanket . " 134 S T O R M W A R N I N Ghands tightened on his . " Is this what love is always like , Helmut ? Have you known love like this before ? " His arms went around her as his last defenses crumbled . " No , never like this , Lotte . " She tilted her chin to peer up at him . " As a novice , I can leave the order at will and with a minimum of fuss when we reach Kiel . And then . . . " He kissed her gently . " What happens in Kiel is one thing . As for now , there can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer ? " she asked . " Two weeks if we 're lucky , though we 'll need to make better time than this . " " Shall I whistle up a wind for us ? " she demanded . " A real wind ? " " No need . " He looked up at the night sky . " I think this is only a temporary lull . Storm before morning . " There was a slight movement behind . They turned quickly and found Sister Angela standing by the mainmast . " Mister Richter  --  Lotte , " she said calmly . " A fine night . " It was Lotte who spoke first , reacting instinctively in Richter 's defense . " This was my fault , Sister , believe me . None of Mister Richter 's doing . " " I 'm well aware of that , child . I 've been here for the past five minutes . But now , I really do think you should go below . " Lotte hesitated , then started toward the companionway reluctantly . ' When she was halfway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mister Richter will be happy to talk to you again tomorrow , if his duties permit . " The girl caught her breath , paused , then turned and fled down the companionway . Richter said , " Do I understand from this , Sister , that I actually have your permission to . . . " " Come courting , Mister Richter ? " She smiled faintly . " How old that makes me feel . So old . " She turned from him and walked to Berger 's door . Richter watched helplessly as she knocked and entered. 136 S T O R M W A R N I N GHe shrugged his shoulders . " Okay , " he said . " There are guys sleeping in the luggage racks back there . " He took off his shoes , wrapped himself in one of the blankets , and lay on the floor , head pillowed on a canvas holdall ; he was almostinstantly asleep . They reached Glasgow at six-thirty on a gray , sullen morning . Janet had slept badly and had awakened to find that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so to pull herself together  --  to realize that they were standing still . As she threw the blanket aside and sat up , there was a tap at the door and he looked in . " Alive and well , " he commented . " That 's nice . " He passed a thermos . " Coffee . We 're in Glasgow , by the way . They seem to be disconnecting about half the coaches . " " Then what happens ? " " We pull out in about ten minutes . Bridge of Orchy , Rannoch , Fort William , and Mallaig . Another five hours if all goes well . I 'm just saying good-bye to Fisher and our mutual friend Gericke . I 'll be right back and we can have breakfast . It 's all arranged . " He went out before she could reply . For a moment only she sat there , then got up , raised the blind , and pushed down the window . The platform was almost deserted . Jago was hurrying along to a small group consisting of LieutenantFisher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blue raincoat over his shoulders again . As she watched , Fisher and Jago moved to one side . She caught a brief glimpse of Gericke 's sardonic face , and then Carver turned him around and gave him a push . They went through the door of the station waiting room , leaving Fisher and Jago talking on the platform . Quite suddenly Janet had had enough . She pushed up the window and pulled down the blind . When she turned back to the bunk , she was trembling . " I 'm tired , " she said softly . " Too little sleep for tooS T O R M W A R N I N G 137damned long . That 's what it is . " And she got back into the bunk . " I was expecting your people to meet us , " Fisher said . " I wonder what 's keeping them ? " " God knows . " Jago looked at his watch . " Say , I 'd better get back on board . This thing pulls out again at any mo-ment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough , believe me , " Fisher said . " There 's something about him . The way he looks at you . " " I know exactly what you mean . " Jago shook hands . " A good trip back , anyway . " He got into the train , and Fisher turned and walked toward the waiting room where a coal fire burned in a small grate . Hardisty and Wright warmed themselves in front of it , smoking cigarettes . " Where 's the prisoner ? " Fisher demanded . " He wanted to go to the lavatory , sir . " Hardisty nodded toward a green door with the sign GENTLEMEN painted on it . " The chief said he 'd see to it . " Fisher turned , and at that moment the door opened violently and Carver staggered through , half doubled over . He seemed to find difficulty in speaking , his mouth openingand closing as he gasped for air . Fisher grabbed him by the lapel . " What is it , man ? " he demanded . " He  --  he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at his groin . " The bastard 's got away . " Gericke had asked to go to the lavatory for the most genuineof reasons . The idea of escape at this stage hardly seemed to be in the cards , especially when one considered those damned handcuffs . What had happened had been a spur-of-the-moment decision , the briefest of opportunities instantly seized . " I 'll see to this , lads . " Carver had pushed him toward138 STORM WARNINGthe door and kicked it open . " You two have a quick smoke while the going 's good . " Inside , there was a row of stalls , a urinal , a broken washbasin , and rain drifting in through the open window above the basin . It was the sight of that window that stirred Gericke . The chief petty officer leaned against the door . " All right , get on with it . " Gericke moved toward one of the stalls , turned , and held out his handcuffed wrists . " A little awkward with these things . " " Oh , a sit-down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to extractevery last ounce of humiliation from the situation . " I think we might stretch a point there , Commander . " He produced the key and unlocked one handcuff . " There , that will do you . And you 'll have to leave the door open , of course . I 'm sure you wo n't mind me watching , under the circumstances . " " Thank you , Chief , " Gericke said calmly , and lifted his right knee into Carver 's crotch . Barkentine Deutschland , 21 September 1944 Lat. 490 52'N , long . 14  --  59'W . Wind force 5-6 . Intermittent squalls . Heavy rain . It is now necessary to pump four hours out of each twenty-four , which seems to suffice , and thanks to the size of the crew is less of a burden than it otherwise would have been . Our position now approximately220 miles southwest of Ireland . EightFfisher moved out of the parcels ' office with Carver hobblingat his heels and paused outside the waiting room . " Goddamn you , Carver , I 'll have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the corner on the run . " He has n't gone through the barrier , that 's definite , sir , " Hardisty said . " Two redcaps on duty there . They 're putting the word out now . " " Go through that damned luggage room again , " Fisher ordered . " He 's got to be here somewhere . Nowhere he could go , not in the time . " 140 S T O R M W A R N I N GThe two leading seamen went off . Carver said bitterly , " When I get my hands on that German bastard I 'll .... " " Oh , shut up , for God 's sake , and let me think , " Fisher said . There was the shrill blast of a whistle ; the guard 's flag fluttered . A sudden hiss of steam and the train started to ease forward . One or two sailors leaned out of carriage windowsto see what the fuss was about , but most of the passengerson board were still hardly stirring . " I mean , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demanded , and then , as realization dawned , he almost choked . " The train , Chief ! " he shouted . " He must have got back on the train . It 's the only possible explanation . " It was already moving fast , but there was still time , and he jumped for the open door of the guard 's van as it passed , turning to pull Carver up behind him . Hardisty and Wright , running along the platform to join them , were too late . " Here , what 's going ? " the guard demanded . Fisher ignored him , drew his revolver , and turned to Carver . " All right , Chief , let 's rout him out , " he said . Janet Munro 's travel voucher being marked TOP PRIORITY , the sleeping car steward served her first that morning , a good English breakfast of bacon , scrambled egg , marmalade , toast , and tea . Jago could hardly believe his eyes . " Did I say there was a war on ? " " Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I certainly joined the right ship this time . " He sat down on the other side of the small table that the steward had pulled up from under the window . Janet poured the tea . " You know , I 've actually managed to acquire a taste for this stuff , " Jago said . There was a knock at the door . Janet , who was nearest , S T O R M W A R N I N G 141reached to open it . Fisher moved in , revolver in his right hand , Carver behind him . " What in the hell is going on ? " Jago demanded . " He gave Carver the slip back there in the station , sir , " Fisher told him . " Asked to go to the lavatory . ... " " Save it for your court-martial , Lieutenant , " Jago said brutally . " Just tell me one thing . " He turned to Carver . " Did you unlock his handcuffs ? " Carver licked his lips nervously . " Just one , sir . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't believe it . " Jago exploded . " One chance  --  any chance  --  that 's all a guy like that needs . " He turned away , white with anger . " So , he 's on the train , is that what you 're saying ? " " I think so , sir . " Fisher hesitated and then added awkwardly , " I mean , there was n't anywhere else for him to go . There was n't time . " " You think so ? " Jago said . " All right then , Lieutenant , where is he ? German lieutenant commanders must be kind of thin on the ground , would n't you say , especially on the West Highland Line ? " Fisher glanced nervously at Carver , then back at the American . " I  --  I just do n't know , sir . We started with the guard 's van and worked our way forward . " " And there was no sign of him . Well , that figures . He 'd hardly advertise . Is he armed ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but one look from Jago was enough . " I 'm afraid so , sir . I was carrying a spare , sir . A Mauser . Just in case . " " In case of what ? " Jago demanded and then waved a hand . " Do n't bother , Chief , we 've got more important things to consider . " He opened his holdall and took out a service-issue Colt automatic and slipped it into one pocket . " Put those pistols away for the moment . No need to set the entire train on its ear . If he is on board , which I doubt , any confusion can only assist him . " 142 S T O R M W A R N I N GFisher , delighted to hand over the reins , said eagerly , " What are we going to do , sir ? " " Carver stays up here at one end , you and I go back to the guard 's van and work our way forward . Every compartment , every lavatory . We 'll find him  --  if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he 's on a streetcar right now , heading for Glasgow and a Portuguese or Spanish boat if he can find one . " " In German uniform ? " Janet said . " He would n't last five minutes . " " Last year a London journalist walked down Oxford Street to Piccadilly dressed as an SS colonel , " Jago said grimly . " And no one took any kind of notice . There are so many uniforms around these days people are punchdrunk . " He nodded to Fisher and Carver who moved outside . " You stay close to home . I 'll be back soon . " It was a good hour later and the train was approaching the northern end of Loch Lomond when they reappeared , Fisher paler than ever , a picture of total dejection . Carver lurked in the corridor outside . " No Gericke ? " Janet said . " What do you think ? " The guard , an old man long past his prime who had only stayed on because of the war , appeared behind Carver . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head . " Wherever he is , it is n't on board this train . We 've checked every inch . " The guard said , " Not quite , sir . They coupled a flattop on at Glasgow behind my van with three jeeps on it for deliveryto the Royal Navy at Mallaig . Mind you , there 's no way he could have got out there as far as I can see . " " Is that so ? " Jago said , and he reached up and pulled the communication cord . Gericke had enjoyed a surprisingly comfortable trip in the back of one of the jeeps on the flattop . He was out of theSTORM WARNING 143rain and the views were spectacular  --  the kind of country he liked . He had no set plan , allowing things to happen as the cards fell . The opportunity to put Carver down had been too good to miss  --  the decision to get back on the train so obvious that he had n't really thought about it . He 'd simply jumped for cover , head down . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , in regard to uniform , most naval officers looked the same the world over . All he had to do was remove the swastika and eagle from the Kriegsmarine badge on his uniform cap ; and he was doing just that , the handcuffs swinging from his left wrist , when the train started to grind to a halt with such violencethat he was thrown from the seat . The game was up , so much seemed obvious , for the train was passing through a long narrow cut with sides that were almost perpendicular . Yet Gericke was reluctant to throw in the towel . He had nothing to lose . While the train was still sliding to a halt , he moved along the flattop to the rusting iron ladder at the rear of the guard 's van . There was a catwalk on the roof and he ran along it , jumping to the first coach , almost losing his balance as it swayed violently from side to side . He made it to the next roof and threw himself flat on his face as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only the heavy rain , the hiss of steam , and then windows going down , doors opening  --  excited voices . Someone was running along the side of the track . He heard Fisher say , " Nowhere for him to go this time . " " Exactly , " Jago called . " So play it cool . No need for gunplay . Much better to get him back in one piece . " They moved on . Gericke , daring all , went over the edge and slipped down the ladder to the bridge between the coaches . He opened the door before him and moved inside . The corridor was lined with people , mostly sailors on their way to the naval depot at Mallaig , leaning out of the144 S T O R M W A R N I N Gwindows , looking back along the track . There was a great deal of speculation going on as to what it was all about . Gericke moved along the corridor , thrusting his left hand and the dangling handcuffs into his pocket . No one took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then a young sailor , moving back from a window , pushed into him . He turned , took in the raincoat and uniform cap , and said quickly , " Sorry , sir . " " That 's all right . " " What 's going on back there , sir ? " " God knows , " Gericke said . " I saw a couple of officers with guns in their hands . Maybe some prisoner or other has given them the slip . " He stood at a window for a while , just one of the crowd watching , and saw Jago and the others climb back on board . The guard 's whistle sounded , there was a hiss of steam , the wheels spun , and the train moved forward again . People started to go back into their compartments and he carried on . He crossed to the sleeping car and immediatelyfound himself in a calmer , more ordered world . The corridor was deserted , and as he started along it , a door at the far end opened and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Can I help you , sir ? " Gericke , improvising fast , remembered the conversation he had overheard earlier about Jago and the girl he was sharing a sleeping compartment with . What was her name again ? Dr. Munro , an American admiral 's niece . It had a certain black humor to it . " I 'm Lieutenant van Lott , Royal Netherlands Navy , " he said smoothly , " I was looking for Dr. Munro . " " Compartment fourteen . This way , sir . " He turned , moved a little way along the corridor , and knocked at a door . Gericke followed . The door opened and Janet peered out . " Gentleman here was looking for you , Doctor . Lieutenant van Lott of the Dutch navy . " S T O R M W A R N I N G 145Janet looked Gericke over calmly . " Thank you , " she said and added to Gericke , " Wo n't you come in ? " The steward departed and Gericke moved past her into the compartment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , arms folded , watching him gravely . " You do n't look too good to me , Lieutenant . What 's the trouble ? " " I 'm not sure . I was n't feeling marvelous in Glasgow . Nearly got off the train there , but it 's essential I get to Mallaig today . Someone told me there was a doctor on the train so I asked the steward . " " You 'd better sit down . " He perched on the edge of the bunk . She put a hand on his forehead . " You could be running a fever . " " You think so ? " " But definitely . " She was close enough for him to smell her perfume ; she sat down beside him and took his pulse , crossing one knee over the other . " You 've got excellent legs , Doctor . " " It 's been said before , " she said calmly and stood up . " A large Scotch , I think , is my prescription for you . " " You think so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need it . " She found the bottle in Jago 's holdall , took a glass from the small washbasin in the corner , and poured him a large one . " Good health , " Gericke said . " Prosit , " she replied and smiled . " How stupid of me . That 's German , is n't it ? " Gericke sighed and took the whisky down in a single swallow . " That was really most kind of you , " he said and reached out and shot the bolt on the door . Jago made his way along the swaying train , Fisher and Carver behind him . " But what in the hell am I going to do , sir ? " Fisher asked plaintively. 146 S T O R M W A R N I N G " Run for the hills . Blow your brains out . Why ask me ? " Jago demanded . " It 's your problem , Fisher . I was n't even there . I was back on the train . " He had no intention of being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he opened the door and entered the sleeping car , the steward was just emerging from the end compartment with a tray . " We 'll have some tea or coffee , " Jago told him . " Anythingyou can rustle up . " " In Dr. Munro 's compartment ? " The steward hesitated . " Actually she has someone with her at the moment , sir . A Lieutenant van Lott . Dutch naval officer . " Jago looked at him . " A small guy with a pale face , " he said carefully . " White cap , navy blue raincoat ? " " That 's right , sir . I 'm short of coffee , but I think I can manage tea for you gentlemen . I 'll see to it directly . " He moved along to his kitchen . Jago took the Colt automaticfrom his pocket and turned to Fisher . " Well ? " he said . " I ca n't believe it . " Fisher looked stunned . " It does n't make sense . " " Just give me a minute , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll have the sod out of there . " " Like hell you will . We 've got Dr. Munro to consider , so we play this very carefully indeed till we know what 's going on . Understand ? " He moved quietly along the corridor to Janet 's compartment . He tried the door handle gently without success , took a deep breath , and knocked . " Janet , you in there ? " His voice was muffled . She took a step toward the door but Gericke pulled her back , the handcuffs dangling from his wrist , plain to see now . " I do n't think so . Not at the moment . " Jago rapped on the door again , a little more insistently . " Hey , come on , Janet . Open up . " Gericke sat on the edge of the bed . " How did you know ? " STORM WARNING 147 " When I first saw you at the London cage there was an eagle and swastika above the badge of that rather sweet , white cap you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have missed you ? " " One of your bad days , I expect . Charm , like most things , has its limitations . Now would you mind very much if we bring this little farce to an end ? " She put a hand to the bolt and Gericke produced the Mauser from his pocket and cocked it . " I do n't suppose you 'd like to take my pulse again ? " " Not today , I 'm fully booked . " " Ah , well , I shall always have the memory . " He clicked his heels , gave a little bow , and handed the Mauser across , butt first . " Is n't that how Conrad Veidt does it in all those Hollywood movies ? " She stopped smiling . " You fool , " she whispered . " And in the end , where has it got you ? " He shrugged . " The rules of the game , Doctor . You have to keep moving . " She pushed back the bolt , opened the door , and stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Carver grabbing Gericke roughly and turning him around , jerking his arms behind his back . " You all right ? " Jago demanded . She handed him the Mauser . " He behaved like a perfect gentleman . " " I 'm sorry about that , " Gericke said cheerfully over his shoulder . She laughed harshly . " Get him out of here , for God 's sake . " Carver shoved Gericke , whose wrists were by now handcuffed behind him , into the corridor . Jago handed him the Mauser . " Try not to lose it again . Or him . " " I wo n't , sir . You can count on that , " Carver said grimly , and he put a knee behind Gericke and sent him staggering. 148 STORM WARNINGThe train stood in Fort William for twenty minutes while Fisher used the phone in the stationmaster 's office . Finally he came out , climbed into the guard 's van , and knocked on the door of the luggage compartment . As Carver opened it , the train started to move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " We 're taking him on to Mallaig . Back to Glasgow on the afternoon train . How is he ? " " Trussed up like a Christmas turkey . " Fisher walked over to the cage and looked inside . Gericke sprawled across the mailbags , wrists handcuffed behind him , ankles tied together with twine . The lieutenantsat down , suddenly very tired indeed , and lit a cigarette . Thank God the nightmare was over at last . No courtmartial , no inquiry . Well , an inquiry perhaps , but then he might not come too badly out of that . After all , it had been Carver 's fault in the first place , the whole wretched affair . On the Deutschland , there were rumblings of discontent amounting almost to mutiny when Richter descended to the forecastle for his midday meal . " Something 's crawled in there and died , if you ask me , " he heard Leading Seaman Roth observe . The watch below were grouped around the narrow centraltable on which stood the cause of their dissension  --  two large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The smell , when someone raised a lid , was really quite special , Richter had to admit that . Enough to take the edge off the strongest appetite . " What 's all this ? " he demanded , pushing his way through . " The food again , " Endrass told him . " Not fit for pigs . Weber 's gone too far this time . " " He 's no cook , " Richter admitted , peering into one of the pans with distaste . " Which Walz was , whatever else he might have been . " STORM WARNING 149There was an uncomfortable silence , for it was an undeniablefact of life that the cook 's death had left a gap that had proved almost impossible to fill . Richter , by implication , did bear a certain responsibility for the present situation . Riedel said , " I served my time in sail , Mister Richter , you know that . I was with the old Kommodore Johnsen out of Hamburg in the last grain race just before the war . One hundred and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights and , according to regulations , each man is entitled to one and a quarter pounds of salt beef and threequartersof a pound of pork per day . " He dipped the ladle into the pan . " And what do we get ? A mouthful each if we 're lucky . " " Supplies are running low , " Richter said . " That pork is half rotten when it comes out of the barrel . You ca n't blame Weber for that . " " Which is still no excuse to serve what little there is like something off the pavement , " Endrass said . " I think we should see the Kapitan . " " All right . " Richter nodded . " You and Riedel here , and you 'd better bring one of those pans so he can see what we 're talking about . " Not that there was any need , for when the bosun knocked at Berger 's door and entered , he found the captain and Prager seated opposite each other , plates of stew before them . " What 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crew , Kapitan . Petty Officer Endrassand Leading Seaman Riedel ask leave to speak for the men . " Berger looked at Endrass coldly . " Well ? " " The food , Herr Kapitan , " Endrass said . " It 's getting so the men ca n't stomach it anymore , and the stink ... " He lifted the lid of the pan that Riedel was holding . Berger grimaced at the first whiff . " You 've made your point . Get it out of here . " Riedel retreated . " All right , so150 S T O R M W A R N I N Git 's not too good , but we 're all in the same boat . " He indicatedhis own plate and said to Richter , " Who 's in the galley now ? Weber , is n't it ? " " That 's right , sir , and he had to be pressed into service . Nobody wanted the job so the men drew lots . " Berger nodded . " I do n't really see that there 's anything much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem on sailing ships , as you know . Once the food starts going off , especially the meat , it needs an experienced cook to handle it , and that 's something we just do n't have . I 'm sure Weber is doing his best . " " I beg leave to doubt that . " Sister Angela stood in the doorway , a pan in one hand , the other nuns behind her . She lifted the lid . " ' What would you say this is exactly ? " she asked Berger . He eyed the greasy scum on the surface with distaste . " Pea soup , I think , Sister . " " So dirty that it 's almost black , " she said . " A rare phenomenon , which is explained by the simple fact that the cook has omitted to wash the peas . " " All right . " Berger held up a hand . " No need to go on . So what do you want me to do about it ? " She handed the pan to Sister Kathe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With your permission , of course . " Berger , for once allowing himself to go with the tide , reached for his cap . " For you , Sister , anything . If you 'd follow me , please ? " So it was that the unfortunate Weber , sitting disconsolatein the tiny galley , surrounded by greasy pans and dirty plates , observed through the open doorway a sizable group bearing down on him , headed by the captain . He got to his feet , wiping his hands hastily on his soiled apron , and Berger said , " Outside , Weber . On the double . " Weber did as he was told . Sister Angela paused in the doorway . She surveyed the scene inside , briefly leaningS T O R M WARNING 151down to sniff at the rotting pork in its barrel , then turned . " Take off your apron , " she said to Weber . He glanced nervously at Berger , then did as he was told . She took it from him , holding it at arm 's length for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I suggest you return this man to his normal duties . This is obviously not the place for him . " " And the cooking ? " Berger asked . " There , you will have to show a little faith , Kapitan . But first , I want every inch of this disgusting hovel scrubbed clean . " She turned to the nuns . " Every pan sparkling . Then and only then will we be in a position to do something about the food . You agree , Kapitan ? " " We are , as you so frequently remind me , in the good Lord 's hands , " Berger told her . But later , toward evening , when he went up on the quarterdeckwith Prager , the aroma that drifted up from the galley on the damp air was so appetizing that for the first time in days he felt genuine hunger . " What 's that ? " he demanded of Richter who had the watch . " I think it 's what 's called the woman 's touch , Herr Ka-pitan . " " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Janet stood at the window of her sleeping compartment , looking out morosely . Even the spectacular beauties of Ben Nevis did n't improve the way she felt . She sat down at the table and picked up a book . An hour passed , an hour and a half , and Jago continued to sleep as they moved on , passing through some of the most spectacular mountain scenery in Scotland . Glenfinnan , Lochailort , and then the sea and the Sound of Arisaig , shrouded in mist and rain . She had long since discarded her book . She sat smoking a cigarette , watching raindrops roll down the window , thinking of Gericke , mainly because the thought of him152 S T O R M W A R N I N Gsimply would n't go away . And that would never do . She picked up the book again and forced herself to read . Lying face down on the mailbags Gericke could n't see Carver , but he was conscious of his approach . The chief petty officer squatted beside him , a knife in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Very foolish , " Gericke said . " You 'd never be able to explain it away . " Carver took the Knight 's Cross from his pocket . " Did you do something special for this one then ? Big hero , is that it ? " The anger welled up in him like hot lava . He sliced through the cords that bound Gericke 's ankles and grabbed his arm . " Come on  --  on your feet . " Gericke stood there swaying , almost crying out with pain as blood moved in his cramped legs . Carver pushed him out through the gate , then tripped him so that he fell to his knees , head resting on the floor . Carver booted him in the ribs . " You feel better now , sir ? " Gericke pushed himself up on his knees . " Was this how you won those fights of yours , Chief ? Using men with their hands tied behind their backs as punching bags ? " Carver produced the keys to the handcuffs and swung him around . " I 'll show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gericke , his wrists free , shrugged off his raincoat , a smile on his face . Carver rushed in and swung a wild punch , which the German sidestepped with ease , dropping into a fighting crouch , his right arm extended in front of him , fist clenched , his left guarding the body . And there was somethingterribly professional-looking about the way he moved . The chief stamped in again , swinging a punch that Gericke once more evaded with ease , this time pivoting and delivering a left to Carver 's kidneys . Carver cried out in agony and turned to face him . " Yes , I 'm afraid I have n't been really honest with you , STORM WARNING 153Chief , " Gericke said , sinking another left under Carver 's ribs followed by a right that landed high on the cheek , splitting flesh . " As a young man , I served my apprenticeship in a clipper ship on the nitrate run to Chile . A hard school . Plenty of discipline enforced by belaying pin , knuckle-duster , and boot . I grew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a kind of slow motion , one punch after another finding its target , and Carver 's blows repeatedly landing on thin air . The chief petty officer was in a bad way , face covered in blood , unable to speak , gasping for breath as the German drove him back across the van relentlessly . " My friend , you are a disgrace to the uniform you wear and the country that nurtured you . Someone should have cut you down to size long ago , " Gericke said , striking Carver three terrible blows on the face that sent him back against the wall of the cage . He slid to the floor , head lolling to one side . Gericke stood there looking down at him , then dropped to one knee and went through his pockets , retrieving his decorations . He found the Mauser , which he slipped into his own pocket , picked up his cap , and put on the raincoat . He pulled back the sliding door and rain flooded in .

Barkentine Deutschland , 22 September 1944 . Lat. 50  --  59'N , long . 15  --  35'W . At six bells of the midwatch , the iron collar of the mainsail boom fractured . In the ensuingtangle , the mainsail itself was split from top to bottomand we had to heave to for repairs , drifting under sea anchor until Mister Sturmm reported all clear and ready to proceed at noon . The weather deteriorated into heavy rain and mist soon after . Wind NW 5-6 . NineT he Mary Masters , a nine-thousand-ton Liberty ship out of Halifax , Nova Scotia , with a cargo of pig iron destined for the steelworks of South Wales , had just gone through a very bad twenty-four hours . Most of the crew , including the captain , were snatching a couple of hours ' sleep below . Visibility was poor , owing to driving rain and mist , and the third officer , alone on the bridge , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twentieth time in half156 S T O R M W A R N I N G an hour and the Deutschland sprang into view , he received a considerable shock . He went to the voice pipe to call up the captain . " Braithwaite , sir . Sorry to bother you , but I 've sighted a sailing ship . " " What did you say ? " " A sailing ship , sir . A quarter of a mile away on the port quarter . " " I 'll be right up . " Braithwaite turned to examine the Deutschland again , and a few moments later Captain Henderson hurried onto the bridge . He was a small , white-haired man who should have retired in 1940 but had stayed on for the duration . He reached for the binoculars and focused them . " You old beauty , " he said softly . " Alter course , Mr. Braithwaite . I think we 'll take a closer look . " There were no more than half a dozen men visible on the decks of the Deutschland as Berger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other vessel move in to ward them . Sturmm lowered his glasses . " A Tommy , Herr Kapitan . The Mary Masters , registered Liverpool . " Richter came up the ladder holding the signaling lamp . " What happens now , sir ? " " That 's a merchant ship out there , not the Royal Navy . " Berger glanced up at the Swedish ensign . " We 're still the Gudrid Andersen until someone proves different . " A signaling pennant was hoisted on the Mary Masters , and Sturmm examined it quickly through his glasses . " May I be of assistance ? " was its message . Berger frowned , one hand gripping the rail . She was very near , moving on a course that would take her astern , close enough for him to see the men on the bridge clearly . " I think we 'll try a real bluff this time . You speak the best English , Mister Sturmm , so you take the signaling lamp . Get ready to transmit on my orders . Plain language , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Sturmm made a preliminary signal . There was a pause and then an answering flash . " Here we go then , " Berger said softly . " Gudrid Andersen , twenty-eight days out of Belem for Goteborg . Thank you for your offer , but in no need of assistance . ' " The lamp flashed in reply from the bridge of the Mary Masters , even closer now . Sturmm waited until it had finished , then translated . " ' Out of Halifax , Nova Scotia , for Swansea . Compelled to drop out of convoy yesterday owing to temporary engine fault . ' " The lamp flashed again . " ' Do you wish me to reportyour position ? ' " " Accept his offer . After all , we do n't really have a choice . You agree , Helmut ? " Richter nodded , his face grim . " I 'm afraid so , Herr Ka-pitan . " " With luck , it will take them a couple of days , perhaps three , to discover that the real Gudrid Andersen is still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon as they 're over the horizon . " The signal lamp clattered in Sturmm 's hands ; the Mary Masters acknowledged . Most of her crew seemed to be liningthe port rail , waving , calling cheerfully through the rain . " Ask him if they are still winning the war . " Sturmm turned , mouth open in astonishment . " Get on with it , man ! " Berger told him impatiently . The reply was noticeably brief . " ' Definitely . ' That 's all he says , sir . " " Somehow I thought they might be , " Berger said . " Thank you and good-bye , ' Mister Sturmm . " The lamp clattered for the last time , and as the Mary Masters passed astern , they heard three long blasts on her steam whistle. 158 STORM WARNING " Mister Richter , return the salute . " The bosun hurried down the ladder and ran along the deck to dip the ensign . The hooter sounded again , a lonely echo drifting across the water . " Right , Mister Sturmm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Berger said . On the bridge of the Mary Masters , Henderson watched the Deutschland slip away , and she was already partly obscured by rain and mist when he lowered his binoculars . " Everything I ever learned at sea , everything worth knowing , I learned by the age of eighteen on an old hooker just like her . " " Is that so , sir ? " Braithwaite said . The old captain nodded . " Watch her go , mister . Drink your fill . I do n't think you 'll get a second chance  --  not in your lifetime . " There was mist on the hills , but in Mallaig , it was relativelyclear . Janet waited in the outer office of the naval commander 's headquarters , staring out across the harbor . It was busier than when she was here before , fishing boats , several naval patrol craft , a submarine even , and a lighter unloading at the pier . Her eyes were gritty from lack of sleep and she was impatient to be on her way . She had answered their questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still there were delays . A young Wren was typing at a desk in the corner , but in spite of that the murmur of voices was clearly audible from the inner office . She turned from the window as the door opened . Fisher hurried out , his face flushed , and brushed past her without a word . Jago appeared with Captain Murray , the base commander , a pleasant , gray-haired man of fifty or so . He smiled . " Sorry about the delay , Miss Munro , but we 're all through now . " " I can go ? " S T O R M W A R N I N G 159 " I do n't see why not . You 've told us all you know . As regards your passage to Fhada , Murdoch Macleod has n't arrived yet . The arrangement was that he would report here when he did . If I were you , I 'd book in at the hotel for the moment . I 've told them to expect you . " " And Gericke ? What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Munro , I 'm filled with admiration for the gentleman . " She was suddenly angry again . " Good God , he is on the other side . Or had you forgotten that ? " " Not at all , I assure you . Professional regard for a superb seaman , that 's all . However  --  " Here he turned to a oneinchordinance survey map of the western Highlands that was pinned to the wall . "  --  if he came straight over the mountain from where he left the train he would find his way blocked by Loch Morar . If he cut down to the coast road , it would only bring him to Mallaig  --  and he wo n't come here . " " So where will he go ? " " Not very far , I 'm afraid , because there is n't anywhere for him to go . One road and the railway line coming in , as you can see . Only a question of time . He wo n't stay up on those hills for long , not in this weather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll walk you to the hotel . " Murray shook hands . " I 'll send word the moment Murdocharrives . Have a nice trip , " and he turned and went back into his office . They walked back toward the station , heads down against the rain . Janet said , " What about Lieutenant Fisher ? " " They 'll probably post him to Cape Wrath . " " And Carver ? " " Patching him up now at the base hospital . That must have been something to see . I mean , Gericke really sorted him out . He 's finished , of course . I 'm not saying he 'll end up in the brig , but he 'll lose all rank . " 16o STORM W A R N I N GAs they came abreast of the station , a voice called , " Dr. Munro ? " A young paratrooper in red beret and camouflage jump jacket hurried across the road . " Why , Lachlan , " Janet said . " Were you on the train ? " She turned to Jago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's from Fhada , too . " " Is that so ? " Jago held out his hand . Lachlan was eighteen , and his untidy red hair , freckles , and snub nose made him look even younger . " Fourteen days ' leave . I 've just finished jump training . Murdoch is supposed to pick me up , but when I checked down at the harbor he had n't arrived . " " He 's taking me , too , " she said . " I 'm going to wait at the hotel . They 'll send word when he arrives . Why not join us ? " He glanced at Jago awkwardly . " Would it be all right , do you think ? " " Sure it would , " Jago said . " You get your gear and followus on . " The boy ran back across the road . Janet and Jago paused outside the hotel as the rain increasedin a sudden rush , and Janet looked up to the peaks on the other side of Loch Morar shrouded in mist . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a day like this , " Jago said . " An understatement . " They went up the steps into the hotel . Gericke was slightly northwest of Sitheon Mor . His intendeddestination was Mallaig . There was nowhere else to go ; he remembered enough of the charts for the west coast of Scotland to realize that . All he had to do was keep going , straight over the top and down to Loch Morar , impossible to miss even in the worst of weather , then along the shore to the coast road . That he could last longer thanS T O R M W A R N I N G 161a day seemed highly improbable , but at least there were boats at Mallaig . Some kind of a chance , however remote . And it was good to be free . Anything was worth that . After jumping from the train he had started up the hillside , coming across a mountain stream after ten minutes or so . He followed its course , moving fast , with mist pressing in on either hand giving him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside . There were birch trees at first , which grew sparser as he climbed higher , working his way through bracken that in places was waist high . Occasionally , grouse or plover lifted out of the heather , disturbed by his passing . He kept on the move , stopping after an hour to catch his breath , sheltering from the rain under an overhang . Not that it mattered by now , for his raincoat was soaked through . He set off again , climbing strongly . Three miles to the loch , perhaps four , and the mountains to pass over , but he was conscious of no feeling of fatigue , the first elation of freedom still carrying him on . Half an hour later , the bourn petered out into a small loch , and he moved onto the flank of South Moror , climbingacross a boulder-strewn hillside . The mist totally envelopedhim and he was by now soaked to the skin , for the first time aware of the cold . He climbed on doggedly , and two hours after leaving the train he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ granite and found himself on a plateau . There was a special kind of cold here , a wind on his face that told him he was on top . Then a sudden current of air snatched away the gray curtain . The view was incredible . Loch Morar below him , Mallaigon the far point four or five miles beyond and , out to sea , the islands , crouching in the rain : Eigg , Rum , and Skye , across the Sound of Sleat . There was a cairn of stones ten or fifteen yards away , a track snaking down toward the loch . The curtain of mist dropped back into place but he162 S T O R M W A R N I N Ghad seen enough . With renewed energy , he started down the mountainside . The Deutschland was making good time , plunging into the waves , carrying every stitch of canvas she possessed . From the quarterdeck , Berger addressed the crew and passengers . " The final run , " he said . " Our meeting with the Mary Masters was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on our side . I altered course as soon as I could , just in case anyone should come looking , but I do n't think it likely . However , one thing is essential . Now , more than ever , we must watch those lights at night . There have been occasionswhen carelessness in this regard has been much in evi-dence . " There was a moment of silence , every face turned up to him , expecting more , and there was so little to give . He clutched the rail tightly and tried to put confidence into his voice . " Look , it 's going to be all right . Another seven or eight days , that 's all , and those of you with families to think of will be greeting them again , I promise you . We 've come too far to fail now . " He nodded to Sturmm . " Dismissthe crew , please , Mister Sturmm . " There was a general movement as the starboard watch returned to their duties and the others went below . Berger checked the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cabin . He was pouring himself a glass of rum when there was a knock on the door and Prager entered . " Join me ? " Berger held up his glass . " No , thanks , " Prager said . " But I 'll have one of your cheroots if you have any left . " " Help yourself . " Berger sat down at his desk and pulled a chart of the western approaches forward . Prager said , " You sounded good out there , Eric . " " Did I ? " Berger said wearily . " That 's something any-way . " " Where are we ? Is it permitted to ask ? " STORM WARNING 163 " Here . " Berger tapped on the chart with his forefinger . " Now all we have to do is work our way up west of Ireland , the Outer Hebrides , Shetland , across to Norway . We should be safe enough then . Follow the coastline down through the Kattegat to Kiel . " " It seemed like a dream when we started , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , it did , did n't it ? " And something touched him , a wave of grayness running through his entire body , like a cold wind brushing the face on deck at night , first warning of a storm to come . In the galley , Sisters Angela and Lotte , sleeves rolled up to the elbows , worked together preparing the evening meal . The door was pushed open and Richter entered , an enamel washbasin in his hands . He dropped it on the table . " Salt beef . The last of the crop , and it does n't smell too good . " Sister Angela prodded it with a knife . " Half of it rotten , the rest teeming with life . " " Not to worry , Sister . I 'm sure you 'll manage to do something with it . " He exchanged glances with Lotte , who smiled as she kneaded dough , flour to her elbows . She was n't wearing her coif , and the slender neck and cropped hair made her look strangely defenseless . Richter would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his arms . He pulled himself together hurriedly . " Anything else I can do ? " " Yes , " Sister Angela told him . " There are still a few potatoesleft . You can peel them . Outside . " He took the bowl she indicated , went out , and squatted by the port rail . He took out his gutting knife , sprang the blade , and started on the potatoes . They were mainly rotten , sprouting roots , but he did the best he could , whistling between his teeth as he worked. 164 STORM WARNINGAfter a while , Lotte appeared , a bucket of garbage in one hand . He got up quickly , took the bucket from her , and emptied it over the side . When he returned it , their hands touched briefly and she smiled . As a token , he had given her his signet ring . Impossible to wear it , of course , and for the moment she kept it hidden in her bunk under a corner of the mattress . " It will be all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will get through ? " " Of course we will . Why do you ask ? " " Kapitan Berger . It was something in his voice . SomethingI ca n't explain . " " Nonsense , he 's tired , that 's all . We all are . It 's been a hell of a trip . " He reached up and held one of her hands . " You 've nothing to worry about . " She smiled . " And when we get to Kiel ? " " You 'll never be alone again , I promise you . From now on nothing parts us . Not ever . I swear it . " She smiled warmly . " Then that 's all that matters , " she said and returned to the galley . Janet peered out across the harbor from the bridge of the Dead End . " I always forget when I 'm away just how much it rains up here . " " Five days out of seven , " Jago said . Jansen entered , a cup of coffee in each hand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by dawn 's early light . " Noting Janet 's expression , Jago explained . " He always speaks that way . In quotation . " " A well-known disease , " Jansen told her . " It 's called ed-ucation . " A seagoing launch rounded the pier and moved into harbor . Janet leaned forward . " I believe that 's the Katrina now . Yes , I 'm sure of it . " Jansen said , " I 'll go and tell him you 're here . " He went out . She turned to Jago . " Well , Harry  --  the end of something . " S T O R M W A R N I N G 165 " Or the beginning . " " That 's what I like about you , darling . The last of the great romantics , and that 's a quality hard to come by these days . " There was a surprising amount of light on the pier in spite of the blackout . A crane was working powered by a diesel engine that thumped hollowly through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lighter into two large trucks . At least it gave Gericke , standing in the shadows , a view of the general state of things . There was an old gunboat that looked prewar , with a couple of ratings on the deck . Americans , to judge from their headgear . Beyond the gunboat was a coaster , a single-stacker of eight or nine hundred tons , and then a gaggle of fishing boats . And perhaps twenty yards farther on as the light faded , the dim shape of a seagoing launch . He glanced at his watch . It was just coming up to nine . Those sailors could n't work all night . At least he hoped so , for to attempt to reach that boat as conditions were presentlyon the pier was obviously impossible . He needed somewhere to lie up for three or four hours , preferably with a roof over his head , for the rain showed no sign of abating . There were half a dozen naval trucks parked at one side in a rather confined space , crammed togethernose to tail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be no guard , probably because they were empty . He climbed over the tailgate of one , made himself as comfortable as possible on the floor , and waited . Janet and Harry Jago were sitting in a corner of the bar of the Station Hotel when Murdoch came in . He wore seabootsand his reefer coat , a yellow oilskin over one arm , a splendidly archaic figure that made heads turn as he moved past. 166 STORM WARNING " Can I get you a Scotch , Mr. Macleod ? " Jago asked , standing up . " Murdoch , lad , Murdoch to my friends , " the old man said . " And yes , a wee dram would go down just fine , you being the one with the influence to get it . " Jago moved over to the bar and Murdoch took out his pipe . " Do you mind , girl ? " " Not at all , " she said . " Now tell me about the island . How 's my uncle ? " Murdoch filled the pipe methodically from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " Where would young Lachlan be ? " " In my room . I thought the bed might as well get some use , and he looked as if he needed the sleep . " Jago returned with Murdoch 's Scotch . The old man raised the glass and examined the contents in the light with a connoisseur 's appreciation . " How in the devil do you manage it , Lieutenant ? " " Oh , I let them have a couple of bottles now and then , so they always keep one under the bar for me . " " How is Uncle Carey ? You still have n't told me , " Janet demanded . He said carefully , " Have they work for him yet ? Have you news ? " " Yes , I think you could say that . " He nodded . " His only problem . " " Mind you , it 's not what he 's hoping for . No more boarding parties , sword in hand , if you know what I mean . " " I was afraid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  how can I explain it to you  --  a hunger for action . It is , I think , meat and drink to him . A great pity he can not bide still for a while , and a good woman to hold his hand . " " Jean ? " " That is the impression I get . " " And the best thing for him . " Janet was pleased . " I 'll have to see what I can do . " S T O R M W A R N I N G 167 " Look to your own affairs , girl , " he told her gently . " Some things grow better on their own . " Jago was vastly amused to see her slapped down . She kicked him under the table . " When do you plan to leave ? " " Oh , about two o'clock in the morning if that will suit . The tide will be flowing well by then . I 'll leave you now if you do n't mind . I 'm promised to supper with my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some inner pocket and consulted it gravely . " I should have been there ten minutes ago . She 'll have the skin off me . Terrible sharp since her husband died last year . " " Is it far ? " Jago stood up . " I could get the jeep . " " The top end of the main street . A step only . I 'll see you here at one-thirty . " He moved away through the crowded bar , and Jago sat down . " There goes one hell of an old man . Pity you had to be so openhanded with young Lachlan . There 's a perfectly good bed going to waste up there . " " Good deeds is my second name . " He leaned across , offering her a cigarette . " As it happens , being a young man of some resource , I have a special arrangement with the landlord . " " Somehow I thought you might . " " You know how it is . Home is the sailor and all that . Somewhere to lay his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a single bed . " " And two into one wo n't go ? " " I was always lousy at mathematics . " " Me too . " They got up and moved out of the bar into the hall . Rain rattled against the door in a sudden flurry of wind and she paused , one hand on the banister . " A hell of a night to be out . " " Not fit for man , beast , or an old stray tomcat , " he told her cheerfully . " As my old granny used to say . " " I was thinking of Gericke , " she said and started upstairs . S T O R M W A R N I N G 169He stayed in the shadows , waiting for them to stop , perhapsat one of the fishing boats , already aware with a strange kind of fatalism that they would keep right on coming . Someone laughed clear on the damp air , harsh , distinctive , and familiar . Gericke smiled incredulously as Janet Munro said , " Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Not if I can help it , " Jago told her . " You know , I 've had a great idea , Murdoch . Why do n't you choose the deepest spot you can find between here and Fhada and put her over the side with about eighty pounds of old chain around her ankles ? I 'd say the world would be a whole lot more comfortable for all of us . " " Bastard , " she replied . " Mind your manners , girl , " Murdoch said in reproof , " for if you do not act in a more seemly fashion , I might take the lieutenant here up on his suggestion . " Gericke , smiling again , was already out of sight and halfwaydown the companionway. 168 S T O R M W A R N I N GGericke actually dropped off to sleep , waking in something of a panic to find that a good two hours had passed . Not that it mattered , for it was one o'clock before the sailors on the pier finished unloading . The lights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very quiet now . A dog barked hollowly somewhere in the distance . He waited for another quarter of an hour just to make sure that no one was coming back , then moved out from the shelter of the trucks and went cautiouslydown to the pier . He kept to the shadows , pausing to remove his seaboots and stuff his white cap inside his raincoat . There was a murmur of voices as the two men on watch in the gunboat chatted , the glow of a cigarette inside the wheelhouse . He moved on , soundless in stockinged feet , past the coaster and the fishing boats . The launch was tied up at the bottom of a flight of stone steps . He stepped over the rail , put his seaboots down gently , and descended the companionway , the Mauser in one hand . There was a decently sized saloon , a cabin aft with two bunks , both unoccupied , and a small toilet . The galley was forward . Nothing could have been more satisfactory . He found a towel , dried his feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seaboots . Next , he made a cautious exploration of the wheelhouse . This was no fisherman 's boat , so much was certain . A rich man 's craft . Penta petrol engine , twin screws , depth sounder , automatic steering . Such boats commonly had a range of seven or eight hundred miles , perhaps more . It all depended on what was in the tanks . He found the correct dial that seemed to indicate that they were full or nearly so . What he needed now was an oar so that he might sweep her out of the harbor before switching on the engine . He moved out on deck cautiously and pulled back into the wheelhouse at the sound of voices , footsteps approaching along the pier . Barkentine Deutschland , 23 September 1944 . Lat. 530 59'N , long . 16  --  39'W . Wind NW 6-7 . Rain and intermittentsqualls . During the midwatch , Mister Sturmm requested permission to shorten sail as we were taking so much water inboard that life was becoming very uncomfortablefor the passengers . I refused his request @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . TenJ ago switched on the light in the saloon . The blackout curtains were neatly drawn , and he turned as Janet followed him down . " This is nice . Where do you want these , by the way ? " " The aft cabin , " she said . He kicked open the door and dropped the suitcases and medical bag on one of the bunks . As he went back into the saloon , Lachlan came down the companionway , his rifle slung over one shoulder , a kit bag under his arm. 172 S T O R M W A R N I N GThe boy made a face . " So help me , Doctor , but I feel sick already . " He dropped his kit bag on the floor and Janet took the rifle from him and pushed it out of sight under one of the divan seats . " I hate those things . Never mind , Lachlan , I 've got some pills in my bag . I 'll give you a couple and you can get your head down and sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the galley and she turned to Jago . " He 's always been like that , ever since he was a kid . Believe it or not , but his father was captain of a local fishing boat out of Fhada . " " Was ? " " Apparently he was killed in action recently serving as a petty officer under Murdoch 's son . " " I know , " Jago said . " About what happened , I mean . Not about Lachlan 's father , though . They were torpedoed in the North Sea . I had the unpleasant task of bringing the bad news . As I told you before , I 'm just a bloody post-man . " She was suddenly angry , irritated at the recurrence of the same old theme . " For God 's sake , grow up , Harry . Stop feeling sorry for yourself . " She grabbed hold of his sweater . " You try turning up at Fhada in that mood and I 'll throw you straight back into the sea . " " Yes , ma'am . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his arms and made for the companionway . " I want to get out of here . " They found Murdoch in the wheelhouse with Jansen . " I 've been trying to suggest to Mr. Macleod , " the chief petty officer said , " that maybe it would be a good idea to wait for a little more light . " " And what was his reaction ? " " As I have been sailing these waters , man and boy , for at least seventy years now , I told him to mind his own business and go to hell , " Murdoch said . " A terrible sentiment for a man of my persuasion , but there it is . " " Admirably put , " Jago observed . S T O R M W A R N I N G 173Murdoch took out his pipe . " A couple of plates of good Scots porridge in you and you 'll be ready for that dawn start to Stornoway . " " Porridge ? " Jansen asked . " A grain which in England is generally given to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' It was Dr. Samuel Johnson who said that first , by the way . Not me . As a matter of interest , he actually traveledin these parts . " " Lieutenant Jago , " Murdoch said grimly , " will you get him off now or do I pitch him head first over the side ? " " No offense , sir . " Jansen backed out hurriedly and stepped over the rail . " I 'm sorry , " Jago said . " He is n't really responsible . Something they gave him when he was very young . " " On your way , Harry . " Janet gave him a push . Jago joined Jansen at the bottom of the steps and they cast off the lines . Janet hauled them in , then stood watchingthem , hands on hips . Jago blew her a kiss . She waved and went into the wheelhouse . She stood at Murdoch 's elbow peering out into the darkness . " What 's the forecast ? " " Three to four winds with rain squalls . A light fog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " How disappointing . " " Oh , so it 's excitement you 're seeking ? You must wait a day or two . " " Why do you say that ? " " Heavy weather coming . " " Something really bad , you mean ? " Janet frowned , for she knew that it was not uncommon for Fhada to be cut off from the mainland for weeks at a time . But that was usually in the winter . " How do you know ? " " It is to be found in the wind 's breath , the touch of the rain . The smell of things . " He smiled . " Or in the sum total of a lifetime at sea , perhaps . " She stuffed her arm through his . " I know  --  you 're just an old Highland mystic . Can I take the wheel ? " 174 STORM WARNING " Later . Go you and see to the boy . You know how this trip distresses him . " She left him and went downstairs . Lachlan was seated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the aft cabin , opened it , and found the pills she 'd promised . " Take these with a glass of water , then get on one of the bunks . I 'll bring you a cup of tea . " She went out to the galley . Lachlan stood there by the bunk for a moment then , stomach heaving , reached for the handle of the toilet door . ' When he pushed it open , Gericke was sitting there , the Mauser in his right hand . Janet leaned against the bulkhead in the galley and smoked a cigarette , arms folded , as she waited for the kettle to boil . She was aware of the creak as the door swung open , turned casually , and saw Lachlan standing there , hands clasped behind his neck . Gericke peered over the boy 's shoulder , smiling . " Ah , there you are , Doctor . " Her heart pounded , and so great was the shock that she had difficulty in speaking at all . " You , " she whispered . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motioning with the Mauser . " Now you will please be so good as to come out here and tie this young gentleman 's hands behind him . " He threw her a coil of thin rope that he had found behind the cabin door . Janet folded her arms quite deliberatelyand it landed at her feet . " You wo n't shoot me . You could n't on the train  --  you wo n't now . " He smiled calmly . " You 're quite right . But the boy here  --  now he is something different . A paratrooper as well , so it may be argued that I am helping the war effort . The left kneecap first , I think . " She picked up the coil of rope hurriedly . Lachlan looked sicker than ever . " Sorry , Doctor , but he was in the lavatoryS T O R M W A R N I N G 175when I opened the door , sitting there bold as brass . Would he be the U-boat captain they were on about in Mallaig ? " " At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down like a good boy and all will be well . " Lachlan lay on one of the divans and Janet lashed his wrists , Gericke observing her closely . " Satisfied ? " she demanded . " Not bad . Now the ankles . " She did as she was told , and when she was finished he said , " And now we will go to see your friend upstairs , Mr. Murdoch Macleod . Have I got the name right ? " She had recovered enough from her initial astonishment to be able to assess the situation more coolly and became aware , with a kind of clinical detachment , that she was not afraid of Gericke in the slightest . Which was interesting . On the other hand he was very obviously a man who would kill , if he had to , without a second 's hesitation . He smiled down at her . " Of what are you thinking ? " The feeling of intimacy was really quite disturbing , but she forced herself to stay calm . " Murdoch 's an old man . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't want him hurt . " It was delivered almost as a command . Gericke inclined his head . " Very well , Doctor , let 's see if we can deal with this in a civilized manner , then . " She led the way up the companionway and opened the wheelhouse door . Murdoch stood there , his head disembodiedin the light of the binnacle . Gericke leaned in the doorway and thumbed the hammeron the Mauser very deliberately . " You will please do exactly as you are told , Mr. Macleod . " Murdoch looked him over calmly . " And who might you be , laddie ? " " He 's Gericke , the U-boat commander who escaped from the train , " Janet informed him . " I see , " Murdoch said . " It 's the boat you 're after , is that it ? And where exactly do you intend to take her ? " " Norway , by way of the Orkneys . " 176 S T O R M W A R N I N G " A possibility . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you were doing . A lot different from those sardine cans you 're used to . " " I have a master 's certificate in sail , " Gericke told him . " Is that good enough ? " Murdoch nodded gravely . " Like that gun of yours -- difficult to argue with . And what about us ? " " I 'll drop you off on the way . Somewhere nice and remoteon the coast of one of the larger islands . Lewis , perhaps . And now , as I am perfectly capable of reading a chart , you will oblige me by putting her on automatic pilot and coming below . " " You feel you are familiar enough with these waters ? " " I do . " " Then who am I to argue ? " He locked the automatic steering device in position and moved out , Janet leading the way . They descended to the saloon where he lay on the opposite divan from Lachlan and allowed her to lash his wrists and feet . When she was finished , she said , " Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavens , no . I should n't dream of such a thing , " Gericke said . " You , my dear Doctor , are far too useful . First , you will make a flask of hot tea and some sandwiches , then we will continue in the wheelhouse . " " Continue what ? " she demanded suspiciously . " Why , where we left off in the train if you like . " He smiled . " The galley , by the way , is right behind you . " It was very peaceful in the wheelhouse . Janet swung from side to side in the chart-table chair and watched Gericke at the wheel . " You like that , do n't you ? " she said . " A deck under the feet , a wheel kicking in the hands ? " He smiled . " The finest feeling in the world . Well , almost . " " Are n't you ever serious ? " " Not possible . I realized rather early in life what aS T O R M W A R N I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man of intelligencecould possibly take it seriously . We had a hard time when I was a boy , you see . My father was killed on the western front . " " Was he a soldier ? " " No , a fighter pilot . One of the first . He lasted three years . A long time , but not long enough . " " And your mother ? " " Died in the influenza epidemic of 1918 . I went to live with her brother , my uncle Lothar , in Hamburg . Poor as a church mouse , but one of the kindest men I 've ever known . He was a teacher of mathematics . Had a house at Blankanese on the Elbe from which you could see every ship that entered or left Hamburg . I used to sit in my room at night for hours with the window open watching the lights on cargo boats slipping out to sea . Going somewhere romantic  --  always that . And I wanted to sail with them . " " The beginning of a love affair ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too foggy to see them there were always the foghorns growling out there somewhere at the edge of things . " He took one of her cigarettes from the packet on the chart table . Janet said , " When I was a girl I used to spend summers at my uncle 's place on Cape Cod . Lots of fog there . Sometimes at night you could hear the fishing boats calling to each other far out to sea . " Gericke nodded . " A lonely sound for a lonely place . " She swung around on the swivel seat to face him . " You know it ? " " I sank eleven ships off that coast between mid-March and late April of ' 42 . " There was a slight ironic smile on his mouth . " The Happy Time all over again . For five consecutiveminutes the ' thought actually crossed my mind that we might win the war . " " American ships ? " " All except one . A Spanish tanker that got in the way of the action , so to speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said . " So even a neutral was n't safe from your attentions ? " He smiled sardonically . " Sea wolves . Is n't that what they call us ? " " And you 're proud of that ? " She reached for the thermos , mainly to give her hands something to do , and poured tea into the plastic cup . " Now let me tell you something . Lieutenant Jago let me read the report on you back there on the train . " " Strictly against regulations that , I should imagine . " " That Spanish boat was an oil tanker , the San Cristobal out of Bilbao . There was a big fuss in the newspapers at the time because she was a neutral , then it turned out that she 'd been chartered by the American War Department . You knew that when you sank her . " " Naturally . " He peered down at the compass and altered course a point to starboard . " Then why try to make me think something different ? " He smiled good-humoredly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe . The brutal Hun about his evil work . Machine-gunning the lifeboats , after making sure there were n't any women available among the survivors , of course . " " Damn you , Gericke ! " " Taken care of long since . " She lit another cigarette and sat leaning her elbows on the chart table , frowning and staring into the dark glass . " You love ships , yet you destroy them . " " I 'm perverse by nature . You should try me some time . " " No , thanks  --  and still not good enough . " " What would you prefer  --  some neat psychological explanationon the lines that each man kills the thing he loves ? Come now , Doctor . Even the great Freud once said that sometimes a cigar is only a cigar . " " They certainly did n't teach us that in medical school . " " Just put it down to the bloody war , then . " S T O R M W A R N I N G 179There was a savage tone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For a moment she stood on the edge of something , peered into a dark and private place and drew back . He checked the course again and stared grimly in the dark , his face set , that slight , perpetual smile missing for the first time . " Your English , " she said lamely , " is really very good . " " We lived in Hull for a while . That 's a port on the east coast of England . " " I know . " " My uncle taught mathematics there for two years . " He smiled . " People tell me I have a Yorkshire accent . When we returned home , I tried a year at university . Philosophy and mathematics because Uncle Lothar wanted it . It did n't work out so he allowed me to enroll in the school for naval petty officers at Finkenwarder in Hamburg . After that I went to sea as an apprentice on a square-rigger . " " A hard school . " " As friend Carver discovered earlier today . I sailed in clippers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Australia by way of the Horn . Then I served as third officer on a cargo boat to complete my navigational training . I was all of twenty-two when I took my master 's tickets in both sail and steam . " " And then ? " " Nobody wanted me . I tramped the streets of Hamburg . Visited every shipowner there was , but nothing doing . Times were hard ; the Depression was at its height . We all used to meet at a bar in the Davidstrasse called the Star of David . The man who ran it had served as a bosun under sail and gave credit . I finally shipped as first mate on a clipper doing the big circle . Chile , the States , then across to Australia , and home again . When I got back , everything was changed . " " When was that ? "
