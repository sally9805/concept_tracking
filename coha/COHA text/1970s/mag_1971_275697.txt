TO celebrate Earth Week ( this year 's version of Earth Day , spread over April 18-24 ) , New York 's Bronx Zoo set up this ominous " Animal Graveyard . " Each of the 225 tombstones commemorates a species that has become extinct since 1600-e.g. the New South Wales barred bandicoot , Labrador duck , Malagasy great tortoise and Haitian long-tongued bat . Wildlife experts say that at least 75% of the extinct creatures vanished as a result of human activity .
