" I guess this has been a bad year for justice , a bad year , " said U.S. District Judge Fred Nichol , 62 . At the very least , it had been a bad eight months as Nichol presided in his St. Paul , Minn. , courtroom over the trial of Indian Leaders Dennis Banks , 42 , and Russell Means , 34 , on charges stemming from last year 's 71-day armed occupation of Wounded Knee , S. Dak . After Means called a witness a " liar , " Nichol cited him for contempt ; later he threw Defense Lawyers Mark Lane and William Kunstler in jail overnight for arguing with him . The prosecution annoyed the judge no less . Nichol accused the FBI of " arrogance " and " misconduct " and Chief U.S. Prosecutor R. ( for Richard ) D. Hurd of deceiving the court . <P> Rather Ashamed . Last week Nichol did what he had earlier threatened to do : he dismissed all charges ( three of assault , one each of larceny and conspiracy ) against the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am now over the brink , " declared the exasperated judge . What pushed Nichol over was Kurd 's refusal to allow the case to be decided by only 11 jurors after the twelfth became ill . " I 'm rather ashamed that the Government was not represented better in this case , " said Nichol in the course of an hour-long denunciation of the prosecution . <P> Meanwhile , Attorney General William Saxbe , who has been brooding for some time about the Justice Department 's poor performance in " political " cases , appointed a task force to study the problem . As one department aide explained : " You name it-the Berrigans , the Gainesville trial , the Camden thing-we blew all of them , and more . "
