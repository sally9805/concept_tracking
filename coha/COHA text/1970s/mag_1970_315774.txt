In a calculated move to help pay for the Viet Nam War-without raising taxes-the Johnson Administration in 1968 invited oil companies to lease about 453 , - 600 acres of federal waters for offshore oil and gas drilling in California 's Santa Barbara Channel . The oilmen paid $624 million for 70 leases . But just as the Nixon Administration took office in 1969 , a massive underwater blowout began slopping 1,000 bbl. of oil a day over miles of Santa Barbara 's white beaches , killing marine creatures and raising a huge public outcry . <P> Last week President Nixon heeded the message . The President asked Congress to cancel 20 federal leases on 198,200 acres and establish a marine sanctuary in the Santa Barbara Channel . If Congress approves , the Government will compensate the oil companies for the 20 leases by selling crude oil from its federal reserve near Bakersfield , Calif . Courts will determine just how much the Government will pay . Since the area has not been fully explored , the oilmen may receive more than the $178 million they put out for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to continue operating in the sanctuary in order to reduce underwater pressure , which otherwise might cause further oil seepage . More important , drilling will continue near the sanctuary under 50 oil leases that are not affected by the Nixon proposal . " Any drilling on those leases will pose a continuing threat to the Southern California coastline , " says California 's Democratic Senator Alan Cranston . With Congress in a pollution-minded mood , the Nixon Administration may find its gesture applauded but deemed inadequate .
