Standing behind a box of S.O.S. soap pads and a box of Brillo pads , the announcer looks out from the television screen and soberly , sincerely , begins his pitch : " There 's been a lot of confusion lately over which of these steel-wool soap pads actually has the longest lasting soap . S.O.S. says ' longest lasting , ' and Brillo says ' now lasts longest . ' Obviously somebody has to be wrong , and somebody is . " The announcer removes the Brillo box from sight and concludes : " The facts reveal that only S.O.S. can make this claim . " <P> Not long ago , such head-to-head comparisons in TV commercials would have contravened advertising 's most venerable taboo : never openly knock a competitor 's product . Indeed , ads that named a rival product were long banned at the American Broadcasting Co. and the Columbia Broadcasting System . The National Broadcasting Co. permitted the practice in recent years , but few advertisers dared use it . Admen who wanted to tout their clients ' goods in a comparative way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allusions . Then in March , the Federal Trade Commission , as part of its drive to improve advertising practices , prodded ABC and CBS to allow commercials that named rival brands . <P> Sticks and Stomachs . Since then a procession of commercials boosting one product at the expense of another have bobbed up on the home screen . Promotions for Gulf Oil 's Totem brand sandwich bags contend that they hold more than Union Carbide 's Glad bags and Colgate-Palmolive 's Baggies . Bisodol commercials trumpet its stomach-soothing effectiveness over Turns and Rolaids . A Beech-Nut gum ad stresses that each pack contains eight sticks and displays a Wrigley pack , which has only seven . A plug for a Volkswagen Type III sedan insists that it has just as much in its compact as Maverick , Toyota or Datsun . The idea is infectious . Lincoln Continental commercials refer only to " that other American luxury car , " but the ad agency , Kenyon &; Eckhardt , is studying the possibility of naming Cadillac . Says K. &; E. Chairman Stanley Tannenbaum of name naming : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Though name naming could lead to wild and confusing name calling , it might weaken the campaign for " counter-advertising , " which is a nightmare for agency chiefs . Counter-advertising , pushed by consumerists and backed by the FTC , would allow special-interest groups to broadcast commercials pointing out what they believe are the dangers or flaws of a particular product or industry . For example , Ralph Nader 's forces might lambaste an auto company for alleged safety faults . But if advertisers are willing to call attention to the shortcomings of specifically named competitors ' products-and risk retaliation-the drive for counter advertising might well lose momentum .
