The Presidency <P> It is dawn along the Potomac River . James R. Schlesinger , ex-Secretary of Energy , former Secretary of Defense , former CIA chief , former AEC chairman , stands beside the marshes in a golden silence as old as earth . Mallards rise into the sun . Indigo buntings flit in the trees and goldfinches play below . Says Schlesinger with rare emotion , " Look , a long-billed marsh wren . " He raises his binoculars , studies the scene for long seconds , breathing cool morning air , humbled by the beauty before him in a way that his old adversaries in power never succeeded in humbling him . <P> For more than a decade Schlesinger was at the center of the nation 's drama , court philosopher and iconoclast , a man with big-fisted ideas of leadership oddly matched with a Swiss-watch mind . He is out of phase , decompressing ( sort of ) as the political pace quickens . He was fired by one President , sensed the time to depart another . A rare repository of current history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these autumn days . <P> He twists his head as he hears the greeting of a white-eyed vireo . Then he follows the flight of a parula warbler . Already he has spotted 22 different birds and the sun is barely over the trees . <P> " Can we have a system that works with two equal centers of power ? " Schlesinger asks , his eyes absorbing the graceful arcs of a broad-winged hawk , his mind back on Washington . <P> Obviously , he does not think so . The old Rooseveltian compromise , in which Congress let the President meet emergencies , has broken down . Today , Congress demands an equal voice . Right now Schlesinger sees our constitutional system as a road map to frustration . " It may require an external shock to set it straight , " he says . " It may be a major foreign policy setback , and then the public will insist that we have cohesion in Government . I just hope such a shock is not fatal . The 1980s will be a tune of severe peril . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ structure of Government . The press is in a destructive mood , he believes . " It comes because of disappointment with Government , " he says . " L.B.J. had a lot to do with it , loading on all of those Government programs . J.F.K. raised foreign policy expectations . All of this created grand illusions that all problems are solvable . All problems are not solvable . " <P> " Quick , " he blurts . " A redheaded woodpecker . It 's a beautiful thing . " A Carolina wren intrudes , followed by a kestrel . It is a birders ' ecstasy for a few minutes-a blue-winged teal , a pectoral sandpiper , a black-bellied plover . <P> " We are not going to be a great power if we keep going as we are , " Schlesinger says . " The Soviet Union 's intentions are not benign . So many people grew up after the Berlin crisis . They would not accept the true face of Communism in Hanoi and elsewhere . It used to be so much fun to discover our own moral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These people labored under the notion that if we were sufficiently lovable , others would be drawn to us . Our young had so much security in the postwar world that they felt it was the order of nature , that nothing needed to be done to preserve it . It does not work that way . There must be respect , even tinged with fear . "
