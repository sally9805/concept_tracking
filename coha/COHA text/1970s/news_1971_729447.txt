txt Many a New Yorker found A letter postmarked Weldon , N. in his mailbox last week ; it started out with a flourish of candor : " DEAR CUSTOMER : " In answer to an avalanche of inquiries concerning the cigarette tax in New York . . . . Any person purchasing more than two cartons of cigarettes through the mails is , in our opinion , violating the law .. . " The Apal Distributing Company , Inc. , of Weldon , went on to point out that it " does not and will not " send more than two cartons at a time and was thus " within the boundaries " of the law . That should have been comforting news for the hundreds of thousands of New York residents who have , over the past four or five years , purchased mail-order cigarettes from Apal or from the two now-defunct North Carolina companies whose mailing lists Apal inherited . But any comfort the letter brought was illusory . According to state , city and Federal authorities , the provision of New York State 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sic cigarettes , brought into the state on , or in the possession of , any person " does not include a neighborhood letter-carrier in the category of " any person . " So it was that , some 10 days ago , two Assistant United States Attorneys turned over to the New York State Tax Commission two shopping-cartsful of customers ' names . And one day soon , these customers will be getting another kind of letter in their mailboxes , demanding that they pay the state all that tax money they saved ? and some penalty money on top of it . The customers ' names , subpoenaed by the United States Attorney 's office during legal skirmishing with the two companies earlier this year , are those of between 250,000 and 300,000 New Yorkers ? most , but not all , city residents ? who had purchased cigarettes by mail from The Angelica Company and Weldon Cigarette Company . Both were operating out of Weldon , an unlovely little border town whose post office earned upgrading a few years back , it is said , solely on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went out of business after they were convicted in March of violating the Jenkins Act , which prohibits the interstate shipment of cigarettes ? any number of cigarettes ? without notification of the tax authorities at the destination . But Apal came into being almost as quickly as incorporation papers could be drawn up , succeeding Weldon as that enterprise had succeeded Angelica . The attractions of the business were substantial : they are believed to be reaping a profit of at least a dollar a carton . Weldon 's customers were soon getting little notes referring them to Apal for their bargain cigarettes . And they were bargains indeed : Two cartons ? " King Size , FitLa 's and Regulars of All Brands Available " ? for $6.65 , including postage and insurance , or $3.33 per carton . Other New Yorkers must pay prices , all taxes included , that range upward from $4 a carton . The letters that stag and city tax authorities will soon he posting will add approximately $2.60 to the cost of each mail-order carton . Under the state 's tax laws , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 40 cents city ) tax per carton , 20 cents in sales tax , and a penalty amounting to half the excise tax , or 80 cents , per carton . That brings the price to $5.93 per carton . The publicity and penalties may put a damper , at least temporarily , on the mail-order cigarette business ? but it is not likely to have any effect on the substantial volume of bootlegged cigarettes being brought in by truck , car and sometimes plane . The whole problem , of course , hinges on the disparity in taxes levied by different states . One solution has frequently been suggested : The adoption of a uniform national tax on cigarettes . Last week , representatives of the eastern region of the National Tobacco Tax Association , meeting in New York voted as they have in the past to send to their national convention a resolution urging such a course . Similar resolutions have failed in the past , in large measure over the issue of states ' rights . Actually , few of the mailorder clientele for the North Carolina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing was illegal ; after all , the 20-centsa-carton North Carolina tax had been paid . Thus , news of the New York state and city actions caused great upset and concern . " Will I go to jail ? " asked one customer . Told that the matter was civil , not criminal , she said weakly : " Oh . Just bankrupt . " " The thing was , " said another . Weldon devotee , " the service was magnificent . And if something happened and you did n't get the cigarettes they sent you a form . . . to fill out and sent you the two cartons . They were really terribly nice . " Even the Weldon-Apal order forms , she pointed out , show a high moral concern : " Try to discourage young people from smoking ? " they urge . " If possible , stop yourself ! "
