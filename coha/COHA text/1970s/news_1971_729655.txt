txt President Nixon now plunges in search of a consensus on what price-wage freeze in 63 days . His appeals to congressional leaders had not had the desired unifying effect . So he took his full case personally to Capitol Hill at a joint session of Congress Sept. 9 , hopefully and pleadingly . He calls on Congress for bipartisanship  --  a goal not easily achieved even though there is general agreement on the objectives of Mr. Nixon 's new economics . He invited labor leaders to the White House  --  a long-delayed conciliatory move that may help in some ways but also force some modifications of his goals He counts on public cooperation , something he has had ever since he held out hope on Aug. 15 that the inflation rampage could be checked . The President presented his new economic program to Congress in a way he hopes will make it difficult for anyone to make serious alterations . He first of all assured the country that the present 90-day freeze should not be extended This was anticipated . He then committed himself to a round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and agriculture representatives to plan what comes after the freeze . A meeting with George Meany , president of the AFL-CIO , and other labor leaders was scheduled within 24 hours of Mr Nixon 's address What most observers looked for in his congressional address was the degree to which he might compromise parts of his Aug. 15 program . There was no explicit answer to this in the President 's remarks . And it continues to be assumed here that he would accept some changes that would give lower-income persons a better tax break and cut back on advantages given business . But he did draw a line . He indicated that , if Congress went too far in increasing spending programs or reducing taxes , it , not he , would be blamed for starting the nation " on a spiral of higher prices " How to convince Congress to be above partisanship , at the same time holding a threat over their heads that they will be walloped in the 1972 election campaign , calls for all kinds of presidential dexterity Mr Nixon did not promise that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the campaign stump and give Democrats as much credit as he takes for Republicans . Congress was warned that it " will face many temptations to raise spending and to cut taxes in addition to the recommendations I have made . " In a short run , these always are popular measures . But as we look at the realities of the budget at this time , we must face up to this hard fact : Any additional spending increases not accompanied by tax increases  --  and any additional tax cuts not accompanied by spending cuts  --  will be certain to start us again on a spiral of higher prices . " // By R. Norman Matheny , staff photographer President Nixon *Nixon pleads with Congress // Mr. Nixon took up the major parts of his program one by one : " I urge the Congress to remove the 7 percent excise tax on automobiles , so that the more than 8 million people in this country who will buy new American-built cars in the next year will save an average of $200 each . " Job nriming sought Second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ credit to encourage investment in machinery and equipment that will generate new jobs . " He reminded Demo-crats , who are lukewarm about this proposal because they feel it would not necessarily generate jobs in a hurry and also gives too much of a bonanza to business , that it was " first advocated by a Democratic president and enacted by a Democratic Congress in the 1960 's . " It is at present widely predicted that Congress will either modify or discard this Nixon proposal . Exemption speedup Third , " I urge the Congress to create more consumer purchasing power by permitting the planned $50 increase in the personal income-tax exemption scheduled for 1972 to take effect next Jan. 1 .. For a family of four this could mean an additional $200 increase in tax-exempt income , beginning less than four months from now . " Congress likes this so much that it is expected to liberalize it further by increasing the minimum standard deduction to $1,200 . This has been suggested by the influential Rep. Wilbur D. Mills ( D ) of Arkansas , chairman of the House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very little income . Mr Nixon said little about the aspects of his program that are directed at improving the U.S. monetary position abroad . He did , however , observe that " abroad , we find that adjustments are being made and actions are being taken to set up a new monetary system within which America can compete fairly once again "
