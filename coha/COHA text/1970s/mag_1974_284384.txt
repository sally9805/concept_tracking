As oil profits continue to gush into the Persian Gulf nations , other governments , too , are beginning to make money from the stepped-up quest for oil . In the North Sea , explorations have so far turned up more than 20 billion bbl. of proven reserves , nearly 4% of the world total . Norway alone has proven reserves of about 6 billion bbl. , and experts believe that the potential is at least twice that amount . Surprisingly , though , Norway is approaching its new riches with Scandinavian solemnity . Government planners predict that by 1981 , oil output will pump more than $2.7 billion in yearly revenues into the Norwegian economy . The inflow , they gloomily believe , may bring more problems-in disruption of other industries and inflation-than benefits . <P> Since oil was first discovered on the Norwegian continental shelf about five years ago , some 16,000 workers have left their jobs and flocked to the coast to work on oil rigs and supporting construction industries . As a result , the shipbuilding and fish-processing industries are suffering labor shortages . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been forced to lay up one of its five frigates for lack of trained personnel . <P> Cutting Hair . The Finance Ministry estimates that annual oil revenues by 1981 will be roughly 2 times what the economy can absorb . The government can spend some of its excess profits on social services . It can also reduce its steep income taxes ( now ranging up to 90% ) . But University of Oslo Economist Erling Eide predicts that any reduction in taxation would lead to a severe inflation resulting from Norwegians ' increased spending power . The only way to contain the inflation , Eide says , would be to revalue the krone to reduce the cost of foreign imports . Revaluation , though , would damage such Norwegian export industries as fish processing and paper by raising the prices of these commodities in foreign currencies . Significant unemployment would follow . <P> The Finance Ministry goes along with this dire prophecy and calculates that every $180 million in tax cuts by 1980 would indirectly put 4,400 people out of work by forcing revaluations that would damage export industries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of London calls the " Venezuelan effect , " in which Norway 's oil industry would become " the only provider to a population left mainly , otherwise , to cut each other 's hair . " <P> The Norwegian government is trying hard to slow exploitation of its riches . Britain and other oil-hungry nations have drilled more than 330 exploratory wells in the North Sea . Norway has driven only 120-even though Statfjord and part of Ekofisk-two of the richest oilfields-lie under Norwegian waters .
