 | Traction without studes -- the new technology of snow tires A new super-traction studless snow tire will be rolling onto the market this winter . Designed to give your car the same traction on snow and ice as spikes , but without tearing up roads , it heads a parade of new tire innovations for winter driving . The need for a high-traction studless tire is becoming urgent ? studs may soon be banned everywhere . They 're already illegal in Minnesota , Michigan , Wisconsin , and the province of Ontario . And several other states seem to be on the verge of prohibiting them . Primarily to serve these areas , Firestone , Goodrich , and Goodyear are introducing the new studless tires this fall . But they will be available all over the snowbelt , along with similar tires made in Europe by Continental , Dunlop , Fulda , Metzeler , Pirelli , and by Semperit . Uniroyal says it is currently making the new studless tires , but wo n't have them for sale until 1976 . Other snow-tire developments include new fiberglass-belted radial tires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be mixed with steel-belted standard tires . Bias-belted snow tires ca n't be used with steel-belted radials . Another innovation is the Penetrator ? a new snow tire made by Cooper . Steel coils in its tread give stud-like action with minimal destruction of roads . The Penetrator is considered legal in states where studs are banned . Stud less snows But the big news this year is obviously the new super-gripping studless tires , which represent something of a breakthrough in traction performance . These tires originated in Europe a couple of seasons ago , with two German firms ? Metzeler and Continental ? getting to market first . These were followed soon by the European subsidiaries of Uniroyal , Firestone , Goodyear , and Goodrich . Last year , Goodyear introduced the new studless tire to the U.S. on a test-market basis . What 's the verdict , after a couple of seasons of use , on how well the new tires perform on snow and ice ? No manufacturer of the new studless tires I interviewed claimed that these snows outperform studded tires on virgin-glare ice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off . And they claim better performance than with standard snow tires on other surfaces . In fresh , hard-packed snow , says Mel Robetz , vice-president of Conti Rubber Products Co. , which imports the Continental Contact studless tire , that tire is superior to one with studs and stops in a shorter distance . On ice , he says , the Contact is about 90 percent as effective . Similar performance was reported by Galileo Buzzi-Ferraris , technical manager of Pirelli , who uses the following " grip scale " to indicate the relative effectiveness of his company 's super-adherent MS/ 35 : Standard snow tire ( radial ) 100 M/S studless tire 150 Studded radial snow tire 160-170 Lee Vanderberg , group manager of tire-compound development for Goodrich , says performance of that company 's Trailmaker XTP " is so good that little would be gained by using studs ( where legal ) with the new tire . " All the U.S.-made super-traction tires can be studded . Construction and materials What makes this new generation of studless winter tires go on snow and ice ? First , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except for Goodyear 's , which is a Flextan-belted radial . Flextan is Goodyear 's name for Kevlar fiber ( PS , Aug . . And second , new , softer tread compounds ( with one exception , the Cooper tire , which has built-in springs ) . Even in below-freezing weather , when standard treads get brittle and bounce off snow and ice , the new treads stay soft and flexible . They squirm into road or ice surface irregularities and envelop them to produce more contact and better traction . Various makers have used different approaches to producing the softer tread compounds . Metzeler 's tire is perhaps the most radical of the super-gripping tires . It contains no carbon black , the standard reinforcing component of tire treads . The primary function of carbon black is abrasion resistance . Most tires have about a 25-percent carbon-black content in their tread compounds . Metzeler uses silica instead of carbon black to reinforce its new tread compound . Without carbon black , a tire can be any color ? so the German tire maker decided to color its new treads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still use carbon black , but also use some silica for greater traction . American companies use no silica . What 's in the U.S. tread compounds ? The U.S. tire makers wo n't say , except that it 's done basically with a reformulation of the polymers that go into the tread ? styrene butadiene , and butadiene , plus natural rubber . All use a finer , smaller-particle carbon black in the new formulations , too . Nothing feels or looks different about the new tires , except for that unique blue color of the Metzeler tread . The tires do n't feel softer or more abrasive when you touch them . Durability dispute But this superior gripping does n't come free . Tire engineers agree that the softer the tread , the faster it wears . Just how much wear do you give up in the new tires ? Unfortunately , there are no documented figures . Instead there 's a lot of controversy . The tire makers claim you give up little durability , but this is disputed by independent experts . And , although most steelbelted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no tire maker guarantees snow-tire tread life . Typical of manufacturers ' claims is Metzeler 's reply to charges that silica-laced treads wear out fast . Martin D. Davis , president of Meon , Inc. , New York importers of the tire , says company tests indicate the tires wear at a rate of 1/32-inch per 1500 miles . This would give a tread life of about 18,000 miles . " We expect our customers to get at least three seasons out of our Blizzard Magnet and Blizzard Alpin M tires , " Davis says . A bolder claim is made for the silica-reinforced Conti Contact tire . Conti 's Mel Robetz says the tire will be marketed as an all-season tire because of its superior wetpavement traction . " And we expect the tire to give up to 40,000 miles of tread life in normal use , " Robetz says . But there will be no mileage guarantee , he adds . No silica , but .. . U.S. tire makers told PS that their super-traction studless tires do n't wear fast because they do n't contain silica . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blow the tread off , " says John T. Urbon , manager of tire compounding for Goodyear . Urbon does admit that better traction can cause more wear ? if @# @#  | all things remain constant . However , he says , Goodyear fights wear in its F-32 tire with a new tread design specially created for the studless compound . Both Firestone and Goodrich are using tread patterns identical to those of the old studless tires . How then do they maintain tread life ? " There has to be a slight tradeoff , " says a Firestone spokesman . " The Town and Country R/S tire gets a bit less tread-wear life ? not a lot . But we still think it 's good for at least three seasons . " Goodrich 's Lee Vanderberg says wear of his company 's Trailmaker XTP tire will match that of the Trailmaker without XTP compound . The reason : a third polymer in addition to SBR and BR . But he wo n't say what the third polymer is . The new studless tires should be available in virtually every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not come in sizes required by cars larger than the compact class . The U.S.-made tires will be available for bigger cars , but may not fit the small wheels @# that a lot of imported cars have . Prices for the new tires have n't been fixed by all the companies at this writing . They will cost about the same or slightly more than standard unstudded tires , but less than studded snow tires . The skeptics Not everyone is enthusiastic about the new studless tires . Perhaps the most skeptical are tire buyers for Sears , Penney 's , and Wards , all volume sellers of snow tires . All three told PS that their preliminary tests of the new tires do not bear out the wear or performance claims . Al Goldberg , tire buyer for Penney 's says in his company 's evaluation , the tires " do n't test out at all . They 're good only in a certain temperature range and on certain road surfaces and types of ice . " Springs for winter ? The super-adherent studless tires are one way of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cooper , using a wire coil in each tread is another sys-@# @# tem ; it has been declared legal in Minnesota and Wisconsin , two of the states that ban studs . Cooper 's tire , called the Penetrator , provides a stud-like traction , but has a minimal wearing effect on roads . Cooper says the coils in the treads create 4000 " claw-like edges that help provide grip when the tire is under the stress of accelerating , braking , and cornering . " While the tire companies are stepping up their efforts to provide better winter tires , there 's a question in the minds of some auto experts whether you need them at all if you use radial tires . One of the chief advocates of non-use is General Motors . It claims that cars equipped with its TPC spec radial have generally equal traction to cars with snow tires on hardpacked snow . In loose or soft-packed snow , says GM , traction of the TPC radial ranges from 73 to 96 percent compared with snow tires . Braking traction is generally equal in loose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wheels and bias-belted tires on the other wheels . @#
