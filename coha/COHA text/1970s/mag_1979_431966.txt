 |p483  Along the Great Divide @# DIVIDE ( verb ) : TO SEPARATE . Scaling mountains and creasing deserts , the Continental Divide gives a destiny to each raindrop , each snowflake . For some , the Gulf of Mexico ; for some , the Gulf of California and the Pacific ; for a few , Hudson Bay . And for a very few , captured in Wyoming 's Great Divide Basin , nowhere at all . But in March in the southwestern section of Yellowstone National Park , beyond Old Faithful , beyond roads , the snow seems destined only to cloak a wilderness . It is .. . how deep ? Six feet ? To guide ski travelers , little orange markers have been nailed to trees by a ranger standing on horseback . I see them now at eye level . Great balls of snow in those trees make grotesque shapes . Hunchbacks , gnomes , elves , creatures of a white nightmare . Five of us have ascended to the divide at 8,000 feet , then descended , only to cross it twice more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the continent 's backbone needs a .  |p485  chiropractor . I am here to trace the new Continental Divide National Scenic Trail , which wanders New Mexico , Colorado , Wyoming , Idaho , and Montana . Adding this 3,102-mile route to the national trail system in 1978 , Congress created a senior partner among pathways ? 700 miles longer than the Pacific Crest Trail , * 1,100 longer than the Appalachian . Yellowstone is one of three national parks the route crosses , along with 25 national forests , on its serpentine journey between the Mexican and Canadian borders ( map , pages 492-3 ) . We have come up by way of the Firehole , that well-named river that drains Yellowstone geyser fields . The Firehole joins the Gibbon to form the Madison , tributary of the Missouri , which feeds the Mississippi . Firehole snowmelt is thus destined for the Gulf of Mexico . Going southwest , we follow the Bechler , which unites with the Falls , which joins the Snake , which sends its waters to the Pacific via the Columbia .

Not because of a shortage of wallpaper in Bozeman , Montana , is Jim 's living room papered with topographic maps ? for him , a wish book on walls . " This is the best time to see this country , " he answered quietly . " When nobody else is around .

" " Yeah . . . , " mused Bob Lindstrom , another member of our party . " Something I noticed ? no beer cans here . " The Continental Divide is in fact a hemispheric divide , splitting watersheds from Alaska 's Brooks Range through the Andes to the Strait of Magellan . To make a route between Mexico and Canada , recreation specialists stitched together paths in national parks and forests . Thus the trail was two-thirds complete at birth . The planners usually borrowed roads where no path exists , though in places a hiker must trek cross-country . The segment joining New Mexico and Colorado follows an old railroad bed . The national scenic trail coincides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Elsewhere it meanders within a few miles , crossing from watershed to watershed 475 times . A few hardy souls already have gone the 3,102 miles . The trip requires six months or more , and almost certainly means slogging through deep snowdrifts somewhere in the high country . Most , like me , will challenge short segments of the trail . I logged 375 miles , south to north , by boot , horse , and unfamiliar ski . Nearly all of the trail is off limits to motor vehicles ( including snowmobiles and bikes ) , but roads make many parts accessible for a walk of a day or two . This trail divides not only watershed but also opinion ? about what land 's good for . Forces within the earth squirted a rich stew into cracks and cavities near the divide , spawning mine camps : Silver City , Durango , Leadville , South Pass City , Butte ? all old boomers . Grants , Gallapr Jeffrey City : new boomers . Water captured by the divide m streams ; beavers dammed them . Men c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dams ; more came to harvest the timber . And now in some of the most glo ous places there are simply too many o shattering solitude as we seek its spell . Yet the divide country is still virginal some places , gorgeous in many others . Ev its tale of human quest is seldom dull . A often it is something more : abiding . I member the Biblical answer of an old man Wyoming when I asked why he 'd left a ci to dwell beneath the great Wind Riv Range : " I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills , from whence cometh my help . " Desert Walk Draws Curious Stares A big bird is watching me . As I awaken from a fitful nap in the sparse shade of a mesquite , I see it atop a yucca : a Harris ' hawk ? dark body , a patch of white on the tail . wings nearly four feet across . I have walked since sunup . Stung by a hot May wind , dusted by passing pickups , lugging a gallon of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of New Mexico 's bootheel ? the meanest hiking I 've ever done . " Around here , anyone walking is suspect , " a rancher has told me , and I know he does n't mean just illegal border crossers Anyone hiking in this sun has to be suspicious . Even the hawk knows a body without a vehicle is alien . A few miles west the Continental Divide rides the Animas range toward Mexico . I wish I were in the shade of the pines and junipers on those peaks , but there is no trail . It was the road or nothing . So at sunup I touched the border fence and started north from Antelope Wells , the loneliest border station manned by U. S. Customs : one concrete building and two mobile homes on our side ( pages 484-5 ) , even less on Mexico 's . Dry and bitter , the desert nevertheless amazes with its abundance of life .

In the afternoon , under my mesquite , I return the stare of the curious bird and trail , using their own maps in their own forest . Pack mules crash their loads against trees . Harness snaps . As we bushwhack , my horse , Comanche , catches a strand of barbed wire between a rear hoof and shoe and goes wild with panic . " Mike , get off if you can ! " Ron yells . Tarzan never swung prettier than I onto the nearest aspen tree . It 's easy to lose your way in the 182,000-acre Black Range Primitive Area , on the eastern edge of the vast Gila Forest . A fortymile-long trail follows the divide here , but access trails and signs are scarce . In four days we have met only two hikers . From the North Star Road , northeast of Silver City , we climbed through ponderosas , aspens , and Douglas firs . Bob Williamson , whose sandy hair is phasing into gray , seemed determined to squeeze every drop of pleasure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This would n't be nearly as much fun if everything went right , " he declared the day we were lost . We camped on a grassy slope at almost 10,000 feet . Panniers yielded steaks , potatoes , salad makings , iron skillet , and Dutch ovens . Preparing his sourdough biscuits , Bob declared with satisfaction , " This experience will last me a long time . " With my sleeping bag under the stars , my window on the universe was a rectangle of sky fringed by newly leafed aspens and a big Doug fir . The next night we were under ponderosas . I awoke in the dawn mists to hear , close by , the gobble of a wild turkey . " The lordly gobbler ? there is no finer game anywhere , " Aldo Leopold once declared . Leopold pioneered wilderness preservation before fathering the profession of wildlife management .

Two days later and fifty miles north of Mexico , I stopped in Hachita , town of tumbleweed and tumbledown , and got a drink from Virginia Been . A slender woman o42 years , Virginia pumps gas , serves beer , and hustles the occasional troublemaker out of the Desert Den Bar . " It beats pickin ' cotton , " Virginia said . Around 1918 as many as 50,000 cattle were shipped each year from Hachita . Vir ? inia thinks a thousand people once lived in the town . Today , eighty .

No doubt such optimistic predictions encouraged Exxon Minerals Co. , U.S.A. , to , rospect in the pine-and-oak forests near livide-straddling Pinos Altos . " It 's a very good prospect , " said geologist Frederick P. " Rick " Schwarz , Jr . " But we lo n't know how good , or how much it would cost to mine a ton of ore . " Proudly Rick showed me spots where frilling crews had explored and reseeded . Now each plot was a small rectangle of grass . " We tried not to leave any scars , " he said . The pits , tunnels , and heaps of tailings here date from the 1860 's , when a few men found gold but hundreds more found only disappointment . Rick and I walked to a shallow pit .

" He tossed the lump into the pit . " But if ou 're prospecting , you 've got to believe in that pot of gold . It 's still true today . " Barbed Wire Spurs Quick Dismount A day of misadventure . My companions , Bob Williamson , supervisor of the Gila National Forest , and two district rangers , Mike Howard and Ron Bradsby , can not find the  |p490  the divide where it courses between Gallup and Grants , big towns prospering off the bonanza . Approximately half the known U. S. deposits occur in this region . That is not the end of energy potential in northwestern New Mexico . In the thirsty San Juan River Basin , among rimrocked mesas and scoured arroyos , I met Arthur Sandoval , tending sheep . Seldom have I known anyone more at peace than Arthur , a tall man of 40 years , shaded by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studies at the University of New Mexico , Arthur had returned " to civilization ? our civilization , being out with nature . " This was Sunday . On Monday Arthur would travel to the Indian school at Pueblo Pintado , where he teaches . " But back here , " he emphasized , " I 'm home . " A few miles away a coal strip mine may soon heave up miles of land . Miners , construction crews , railroad lines : The impact will be enormous on this remote region . " I know there 'll be strangers coming , " Arthur said , " but I figure they 'll stay on their side of the fence and we 'll stay on ours . " I looked up Frank Willetto , who represents the Pueblo Pintado area on the Navajo tribal council . A Marine in World War II , Frank was one of the fabled " code talkers " who radioed orders in Navajo to confound Japanese eavesdroppers . The strip mine ? " I know there 's going to be change , " Frank told me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Violence , crime . All that comes with development . " Because the coal is largely owned by the Santa Fe Railway , Navajos will reap few royalties . That does n't bother Frank . " No one can repay the Indian for what the white man has done to him . But if mining brings a hospital and new roads or helps us educate our people , that will be good . " Conquering the Divide The last six hundred feet of elevation : a terror for lungs and legs . Breathe ; pull up a step ; breathe . The heights surrender grudgingly in the Weminuche Wilderness of the San Juan National Forest in southwestern Colorado . But each gain unfurls a new vista . A boggy meadow , lush with white-and-gold @# @#  |p492  marsh marigolds . Two lakes , blue panes on a greensward .

The doughty steam locomotive chuffed uphill at 13 miles an hour , locked into a sinuous dance with the boiling Animas River . We dropped off at a meadow called Elk Park , then entered the Weminuche and hiked up a few miles to a shelf of land shining with beaver ponds . Sunset burnished Electric Peak as Mick , our provisioner , laid out the spices he 'd brought to enliven our dried foods : coriander , cumin , oregano , basil , and more . Oh , we would be seasoned travelers ! But salt : Where was the salt ? No matter ; with enough curry in the lentils ... . Thunder rattled among the peaks the next day as we continued upward . In the late 492 afternoon rain chilled our spirits . We came to a one-room relic of a miner 's shack and crowded inside .

" The sodden teenagers laden with gear glanced into the crowded room and moved south on a path already named Continental Divide Trail , then left it , edging along a mountainside of talus . We descended to a trail splayed and eroded by hooves and boots . The Weminuche is a huge wilderness401,600 acres ? but the part we chose , the part of greatest elevation and grandeur , pays dearly for being beautiful . Rangers are planning to limit traffic in the most heavily used areas . Who left those sneakers . . . that towel carried off from a Holiday Inn ? The best that can be said of such thoughtlessness is that it gave Ellen Klaver a summer job with @#  |p493  the Forest Service .

The next day I hiked to the other side of Florida Mountain and looked down on a camp of sheet-metal buildings , the summer home of drillers and geologists . Public Service Company of Oklahoma has been prospecting for uranium since 1975 on old gold and silver claims within the Weminuche . This area never should have been designated as wilderness , " a geologist said . " It was known there were minerals here . " And not only uranium ; molybdenum also has attracted prospectors . Under the Wilderness Act , prospecting is legal until the end of 1983 , and mining could begin after that . The helicopter may be noisy , but it does n't pound trails as mule trains would ? and it flies out garbage . Your modern mine camp ? portable buildings , a helicopter , toilets that biodegrade .

" John Denver sat on a Victorian sofa in his small office in Aspen , wearing jeans and sandals . Winter skiers were gone , but beneath the window joggers floated past in mindless rhythm . A few miles out of town cyclists strained legs and lungs to reach Independence Pass , where the divide touches 12,095 feet . In Aspen the cult of the body is strong . And the cult of the mind too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  |p494  the Aspen Institute for Humanistic Studies . Bach and Beethoven fill the Aspen Music Festival tent. * Aspen 's fundamental appeal , however , remains that which inspired John Denver 's " Rocky Mountain High " : the conifers soaring like shaggy arrows , the sparkling air , the golden glory of autumn , the snow 's gleam . Aspen in 1945 was a stagnant ex-silvermining town . As it developed , it became " in " ? the premier resort of the Rockies . Ski instructors became millionaires in real estate . Only 1,200 acres , the town burgeons today with 6,000 residents ? plus visitors by the thousands . Luxury homes sprinkle the slopes of nearby Red Mountain , and dishwashers commute thirty miles from Carbondale . Some older Aspenites complain that the town has attracted too many idle rich , that the real people are being squeezed out Mayor Stacy Standley , who came in 1965. campaigned on a platform of taming the " growth gorilla . " City and county have now fashioned a growth plan that limits construction and gives preference to builders of homes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down . The plan is , Stacy said . " our last hope . " Aspen 's real trouble is that too many people elsewhere look out their windows and see concrete instead of what John Denver sees . Between Aspen and Leadville the divide jogs in a semicircle , embracing 14,000-foot skyscrapers like Mount Elbert and Mount Massive , second and third highest peaks in  |p495  . the lower forty-eight , ranked behind California 's Whitney . I did n't see anyone in jogging shorts in Leadville . Its mining-camp roots still reach fc , r ore . The view from many a home is of a heap where a smelter stood . Gold , tungsten , lead , manganese , zinc , tin : This high-rise region has proved rich indeed . But it was silver that created instant miIlionaires in the 19th century and endowed Leadville with 118 saloons , a lush tenderloin , and a population representing Est of Europe .

Brown prospered from the Little Jonny ; his wife was the Unsinkable Molly ? though she really was called Margaret or Maggie , said Ned . The Leadville area has yielded ore worth more than two and a half billion dollars . The greatest part of that has come from Climax , under the divide 's brow .

Climax tailings will be eyesores for decades ; the mine holds ore enough for thirty-five years . I expect this is fine with Leadville , which has no wish to wither . Searching for a Not-so-mighty River From far off comes the yip of a coyote , making the dawn seem colder . Pink light glows on the peaks of the Never Summer Mountains to the west , but morning has not reached down to our tent in La Poudre Pass . I shake the water bottle . Ice .

Waist-high grass hid the watercourse , but at last I got on it . Here on its North Fork the great Colorado River is puny enough to hop across . The Colorado would be a good deal mightier were it not for the Grand Ditch . Shuttling a sizable stream from the western slope of the divide to the eastern , this canal transits La Poudre Pass . Two-thirds of Colorado lies east of the divide ; two-thirds of the water is west , dumped by Pacific storms . Some 24 diversions tinker with the imbalance . Other-side water goes to cities like Denver and Pueblo . @# By far the biggest project , the Coloradc - Big Thompson , carries Colorado River water under Rocky Mountain Park in a tunnel 13.1 miles long .

Looking at the whole West today . he might add : And in kilowatt-hours . In southern Wyoming the divide plunges out of timber and sparkling streams into sage and dry gulches . And then the divide divides . Two ridges enclose the Great D : - vide Basin , 85 miles across . The Continental Divide Trail would follow roads along the basin 's eastern and northern rims , through country that is largely empty . But not quite . There is Jeffrey City , instant boomtown of 3,500 people lured by yet another uranium strike . " If a miner ca n't earn $25,000 a year here . he 's not trying , " banker Keith Bourn said When the price of uranium shot from $8 a pound in the early 1970 's to $40 and more . mobile homes , prefab apartments , and even tents bloomed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nearby mines produce four million tons of ore a year .

" When we come out here , all we had was a ' 68 Ford van that looked like somethin ' out of a junkyard , three kids , and one twenty-dollar bill . Now we got a trailer house and a ' 74 Chevy Blazer ? and I still got the twenty . " To the west , near where the two divides reunite , I came to South Pass City and Atlantic City . Surely , a century ago , men in these gold-mining towns were as happy as Harry . In 1868  |p502  South Pass City boasted five hotels and ( to cite the usual mine-camp measurement ) 13 saloons .

" If I 'd known you were coming , I 'd have cleaned up , " Shorty said in his Bogart voice . I think the natural Shorty ? grizzled , begrimed , rolling his own smokes ? is the better sight . " Mining 's in my blood , " he said . I believed him . Shorty says he bought the St. Louis in the 1940 's because , having lived through the Depression , he wanted security . At the current price of gold , I imagine he 's a lot more secure than most of us .

In a four-wheel-drive van I followed some of the tracks that radiate , intersect , and peter out . Since this is mostly public land , people drive where they please . I noted numerous claim stakes . There is uranium in the basin , as well as other minerals . Antelope bounded across the scrub , raising whiffs of dust . I parked in the lee of a ridge and watched the basin rim dissolve into the deep blackness of night . When stars appeared , the basin seemed not around me but above , a glittering bowl of sky .
