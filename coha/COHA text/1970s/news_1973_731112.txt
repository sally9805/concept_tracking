txt A SUBSTANTIAL addition to Mayor Daley 's home at 3536 S. Lowe Av. was constructed in 1962 by builders accused of making payoffs of $300,000 which were shared by Matthew J. Danaher , clerk of Circuit Court , it was learned yesterday . The brick addition , including two bedrooms and a bath . was built by the Arjack Co. , 9612 S. Halsted St. , according to Arch A. Hermanns , who at the time was a partner in this and affiliated companies with John T. Jack Ahern . Others affiliated with the companies substantiated the information . Arjack was the company which built the Maple Park and Golden Gate subdivisions on the Far South Side for an affiliated company , Maple Park Development Co . IIERMANNS AND the Better Government Association have alleged the $300,000 was paid by Arjack as sales commissions to Garden Realty and Development Co. , no longer in business , in which Danaher and his brother in law , John P. Hyland , were associated . Actually , they contended , the payments were for favorable action on city ordinances required @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permit for the construction , issued May 21 , 1962 , showed the addition to Daley 's home included 8,812 cubic feet and estimated the cost at $6,800 . Hermanns said he was n't familiar with the details , because the work was arranged and handled by Ahern and Danaher , but that Michael P. Coughlin , former controler for Maple Park Development , said he thought Daley sent a check for about $8,000 in payment for the work . At either figure , building sources said , this appeared to be quite a bargain , even at 1962 prices . MAYOR DALEY said yesterday thru an aide that it is a matter of public record that he had some remodeling done on his home 11 years ago . Thru his press aide , Frank Sullivan , Daley said he " has known of the Aherns sic. who did the work but that he had no knowledge of any alleged payoff scheme involving Maple Park Development Co . " The mayor paid for the work when it was done in 1952 , Sullivan said . Daley did n't go to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a severe cold . VIE INITIAL document in the Building Department files dealing with this project was filed May 18 , 1962 , just three days before the building permit was issued . It applied for clearance on zoning and showed Maple Park Development Co. was the contractor . The building permit listed Malysa Contractors , now at 13156 S. Francisco Av. , Blue Island , as the contractor . On the application for the building permit , filed also on May 21 , 1962 , the name of a contractor had been scratched out and over this was written Ada Carpenter Contractors , 10910 S. Western Av . Despite the city records , Hermanns and others insisted Arjack was the actual contractor , and that Malysa was subcontractor for brick and masonry work . Phil Malysa , head of the Malysa company , has been identified as a close friend and former business associate of Hermanns . IT PREVIOUSLY had been disclosed that Arjack added a second floor in 1967 to Danaher 's home at 3504 S. Lowe Av. , and the B. G. A. described this as a 529.000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lion included 8,456 cubic feet , and that dimensions of the addition were 24 feet 8 inches by 49 feet 6 inches by 8 feet . If the estimate of cost given in the application for that permit is correct , Danaher got quite a bargain . The figure was placed at $7,000 . Often such estimates given in building permit applications are substantially inaccurate . Hermanns told The Tribune he broke with Ahern and got out of Arjack and related companies in late 1966 or early 1967 because they " were becoming so involved in politics . " It was the period from 1962 to 1967 when the payments to Garden Realty as " commissions " on sales allegedly were made . HE TOLD OF visits to the Halsted Street headquarters of the companies by Internal Revenue Service agents over a period of time , but that " we finally settled everything " with IRS in 1971 . " When we got our tax problems settled we went to the warehouse and threw out everything pertaining to the Maple Park company , " he said . But he said that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ records relating to the subdivisions and work on the Daley and Danaher homes . Federal records showed that I in 1967 Hermanns and Maple Park Development Co. were banned by the Veterans Administration from any building programs subsidized or covered by mortgages insured by the federal government . TIUS automatically banned them from participation in similar programs of the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development , including Federal Housing Administration mortgages . The ban was made effective to next April . Efforts yesterday to reach federal officials for information as to reasons for the bans were unsuccessful .
