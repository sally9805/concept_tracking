NATIONAL LAMPOON 'S ANIMAL HOUSE <P> Directed by John Landis <P> Screenplay by Harold Ramis , Douglas Kenney and Chris Miller <P> Before National Lampoon 's Animal House , no one ever had the guts to make an honest movie about college life . From Good News to Love Story , from Campus Confidential to The Paper Chase , Hollywood has chosen to regard the campus as a haven for earnest young lovers , gung-ho jocks , inspirational professors and tortured class losers . Animal House , a riotous farce set at fictional Faber College in 1962 , presents quite another picture . The film 's so-called animals-the inhabitants of Faber 's most disreputable fraternity house-are a filthy , outrageous lot . They guzzle and spit beer , drive motorcycles indoors , dump Fizzies in the school swimming pool , pile up 1.2 grade-point averages on their " permanent records " and wreck the homecoming parade . Here , at long last , are movie characters who embody the true spirit of American higher education . <P> Animal House is the first film project of the National Lampoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a fearlessly nasty pitch . The movie has the same strengths and weaknesses as its parent publication . At its best it perfectly expresses the fears and loathings of kids who came of age in the late ' 60 's ; at its worst Animal House revels in abject silliness . The hilarious highs easily compensate for the puerile lows . A few dumb gags about ROTC thugs and big breasts do not detract from the film 's scabrous assaults on undergraduate caste systems , sanctimonious preppies and liberal pieties . Besides , how can one fail to like a campus film that kills off one of the coeds in a kiln explosion ? <P> The film 's plot has something to do with the efforts of a mean dean ( John Vernon ) to shut down the frat house , but it is really just an excuse for a series of bits that are far too hot for TV 's Saturday Night Live . We watch the homoerotic rituals of a fraternity initiation and the orgiastic excesses of an all-night " toga " party .

Animal House ends with a where-are-they-now epilogue that demolishes the sentimental finale of American Graffiti , also set in 1962 . <P> The cast is large and talented . Thomas Hulce ( the class " wimp " ) , Stephen Furst ( the class " blimp " ) , James Daughton ( a BMOC of ambiguous sexuality ) and Karen Allen ( as the sexiest of the animals ' girls ) are much more subtle performers than the material demands . Donald Sutherland , playing Faber 's obligatory pot-smoking English prof , and Verna Bloom , as the dean 's alcoholic wife , score some wicked points against the postgraduate generation . <P> Though Director John Landis ( The Kentucky Fried Movie ) strives for an ensemble effort , he does allow one true star performance-from John Belushi . This Saturday Night Live regular , here making his big-screen debut , may be the funniest fat comic actor since Jackie Gleason . Ill-shaven and semicomatose , Belushi plays the mangiest animal of them all .
