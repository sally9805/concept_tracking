The auto industry used to count it an achievement to put two record years back to back , but now , for the first time since 1965 , it is rolling toward three straight annual records . Sales this year , including imports , will wind up at about 10,850,000 cars , some 600,000 ahead of last year 's previous high . Yet at what by Detroit standards is , if anything , ripe old age the boom seems to be accelerating further , and the companies ' main problem is producing enough cars to keep dealers well stocked . The same is true of trucks , which constitute a good gauge of the state of the economy . Manufacturers are selling all the trucks that they can produce ; volume this year will be about 2,470,000 , way up from last year 's record 2,070,000 . <P> For the first quarter of next year , the makers are scheduling an output of 2.6 million cars , 16% more than in the hot first quarter of 1972 and about equal to the alltime quarterly high set in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start , automen are predicting yet another sales record of 11 million or more cars for all 1973 , if-and it is a big if-the United Auto Workers do not stage a long strike against one of the Big Three when contracts expire next fall . <P> Luxury Compacts .

They are concentrating their purchases on compact cars , which now account for just over one-third of the market , easily outselling the next most popular class , the intermediates , which have just over one-fifth . Some of the fastest sales increases this year have been reported for American Motors ' Gremlin ( up 40% ) , the Chevy Nova ( up 33% ) and the Plymouth Valiant ( up 19% ) .

Overall , sales of imported cars have held about even in numbers , but their share of the U.S. market has slipped to 14.8% this year from 15.4% in 1971 . Imports that offer basic transportation and not much else are down : Volkswagen sales are off 14% this year , and Toyota volume has declined 6% . Foreign-made cars that also offer a touch of luxury are selling much better .
