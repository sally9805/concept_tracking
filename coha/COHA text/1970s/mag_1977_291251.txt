COVER STORY THE BATTLE OF NEW YORK <P> The National Guard had sealed off lower Manhattan when the great beast was first sighted , and helicopter gunships buzzed like giant killer bees over the East River . But the beast was undeterred . Lusting for some nameless trophy , he climbed down from the top of the New York Post building and lumbered up Second Avenue toward the deserted offices of New York magazine ... <P> To many New Yorkers , that tale would have seemed only slightly more bizarre than the melodrama unfolding on their front pages and television screens last week . Rupert Murdoch - the furry-browed , softspoken , intensely competitive Australian owner of ten major newspapers , 13 magazines and dozens of lesser publications-had no sooner established himself as the owner of the city 's only afternoon paper , the Post ( circ. 500,000 ) , than he was making a surprise bid to buy control of the New York Magazine Co . New York Founding Editor Clay Felker , meanwhile , canvassed millionaires around the world for help in fighting the takeover attempt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ implications of the whole affair . After a pageant of dramatic late-night board meetings and a spirited ballet of lawyers swirling into court , however , New York magazine finally got a new master-and America a new press lord . <P> That spectacle would have made a King Kong-size story for New York , the small but influential weekly that celebrates the life-styles of the city 's rich , its powerful and its houseplant owners . ( Felker 's editors indeed commissioned Cartoonist David Levine to draw a stinging cover portrait of Murdoch as one of those South American killer bees beloved of Murdoch-style tabloids ; Felker thought better of it eventually . ) But there almost was no new issue of New York . Nearly all the magazine 's 125-member staff walked out in support of Felker , and only some last-minute help from the new owner got the issue to press . Felker , meanwhile , went off to start a new magazine . <P> The siege of New York was not just another neighborhood rumble on the tight little island that is the nation 's publishing capital . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last year , not only publishes the much-imitated New York ( circ. 375,000 ) and the nation 's leading counterculture weekly newspaper , the Village Voice ( circ. 162,000 ) , but has already started its own invasion of the West Coast with the successful launching last April of New West ( circ. 290,000 ) . The company 's takeover by Rupert Murdoch marks an important new addition to the largely sex-and-scandal press empire that Murdoch is building in Australia , Britain and the U.S. It also marks Murdoch 's emergence as a major presence in U.S. journalism . Having committed roughly $45 million to his twin gambles within the past two months , Murdoch appears to control ample amounts of money , and , as he proved last week , he is accomplished at quick takeovers . <P> The story of Murdoch 's latest foray begins with Clay Felker , the gifted but erratic editor who virtually invented New York ( see box ) . He first met Murdoch about four years ago at the Virginia home of Washington Post Chairman Katharine Graham .
