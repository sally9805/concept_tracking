" In his October 30th speech to the National Press Club and in an article in this issue , Sen. Charles Mathias has voiced sentiments that most liberal Republicans will privately if not publicly applaud . Even before a recent Galhip poll placed Reagan ahead of Ford , Senator Mathias had joined Senator Percy in the preparation of a 400-word statement , circulated in Republican leadership circles and said-to have been signed by fifteen Republican Senators , which warned the President that the GOP must retain a broad base of appeal . The warning was ignored , with consequences that have now become apparent . With the New Hampshire primary close at hand , Ford 's fund raisers have run into serious difficulties and David Packard has bowed out as the chief money man . Three or four press aides are reported ready to desert what they regard as a sinking ship . Between them , Howard H. Callaway , President Ford 's campaign manager , and Vice President Nelson Rockefeller appear to have seriously damaged Mr. Ford 's cause at the recent Houston meeting of the Southern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advice and usually opts for the least viable alternative . But Ford 's main problem is that Republicans , like most other voters , have come to see him for what he is : a bumbling mediocrity . Frequent appearances have given his true character wide currency and the harder he campaigns the more evident it will become . As a campaigner he is no match for Reagan who , as Vice President Rockefeller notes , ' has that one great speech with the twenty-eight pauses . Nor can he possibly move to the right of Reagan . At the same time , by forcing Rockefeller off the ticket and ignoring the Percy-Mathias warning , he has alienated the liberal-moderate Republicans ( " astounding . . . incredible . . . appalling , " Rep. John Anderson said of the Gallup poll ) who are mostly from the heavily populated states . Thus , with neither wing of the party in his camp , the President is finding it very difficult to locate a solid constituency on which to base his campaign . Senator Mathias realizes , of course , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to enter the primaries ; besides that would only help Reagan . And it is perhaps too late for them to mount a fight at the convention which will , in any case , probably be-dominated by conservatives . But he has not ruled out the possibility of an independent candidacy , though for technical reasons it would be difficult to launch . Should such a last desperate effort be made , he has said that he would hope to be considered as the candidate . He would be a good choice . In heavily Democratic Maryland , he has won four terms in the House and two in the Senate ( he was re-elected last year ) . He was an organizer of the Wednesday Club  --  of liberal Republicans  --  in the House and of a similar group in the Senate . He was an early critic of the war in Vietnam and was one of only two Republican Senators on Nixon 's celebrated enemies list ( the other was Sen. Richard Schweiker ) . At 53 , he is one of the best liked members of the Senate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NATIoN/December 27 , 1975 admired by those shrewd sideline observers , the Senate press aides and administrative assistants . It will be said that he has raised the issue of an independent candidacy only to emphasize the earlier warning to the President about narrowing the base of the party 's appeal , but that does not seem to be the case ; he is serious about his initiative and he had better be , for it might well jeopardize his career in Maryland . It is always possible that the President , in the wake of sharp defeats in a couple of the early primaries , just might decide , for " family reasons " or " the gOod of the party , " not to seek the nomination . But barring some such eventuality , the liberal Republicans have the option of sitting out the campaign should Reagan be nominated or of supporting an independent candidate . Time is running out on the kind of politics they have played with considerable success for several decades . Under Eisenhower they had little difficulty infending off right-wing , ultraconservative attacks . Since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were an asset to the GOP in both state and national politics , for they could and did attract the votes of independents and disaffected Democrats . As a group they include some of the best political talent in the party , including Governori such as Tom McCall and William Milliken , Senators such as Percy , Hatfield , Packwood , Mathias , Javits , Brooke , Weicker , Case , Schweiker and others . But they can not , in their own interests , permit the Republican Party to be captured , without a protest , by the Reagans , Goldwaters and Towers . Either they take some public action or they will be charged with a measure of responsibility for the reactionary takeover and their own careers will be hi jeopardy . Early on , Wayne Morse saw the handwriting on the wall and , with characteristic courage , switched his registration and , quite logically , became a Democrat . If Nelson Rockefeller had made a similar move , at the proper moment , he might have been elected President . Now he is reduced to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Conference that they no longer have him to " worry about " ? much as Nixon once said at a famous press conference that reporters would not have him " to kick around any more . " What the liberal Republicans must face is the fact that the forces backing Reagan are , as conservative columnist Patrick Buchanan has pointed out , an all-or-nothing school : " conservatives before they are Republicans , counterreformationist as much as conservative . " They would cheerfully wreck the Republican Party if they thought they could take undisputed control of the wreckage . President Roosevelt properly appreciated the importance of the liberal Republican constituency . It has money ; it has power ; it has talent ; it is concentrated in key states . Estimates suggest that the liberal-moderate constituency may numbeet0 million to 12 million votes . Roosevelt had this constituency in-mind when , in the last year of his life , he sent emissaries to sound out Wendell WillIde on the possibility of his being named Ambassador to the U.N . He hoped thereby to establish a liberal Republican , liberal Democratic coalition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ October 1944 ruined that strategy . Nevertheless , such a realignment has been in the offing for years and an independent candidacy might be a step in that direction . If right-wing elements take over the Republican Party , as may happen , the liberal Republican rationale for staying in the party  --  that they want " to work from within " ? will have a hollow ring . It may well be that 1976 - is the year when time finally runs out on the heirs ? of Wendell Winkle . It is this risk that underscores the importance of the Mathias initiative . Angola The issues and facts involved in the Angolan civil war are too complex for summary editorial comment . But one fact can be stated briefly and needs to be stated sharply if the Angolan matter is to get the timely airing it deserves in this country : the American news media have largely misinformed or failed to inform their publics . Once again it is evident that the lessons of Vietnam have not been learned . With the exception of the reporting in the Los Angeles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Times , This country 's commercial news media , as they did with Vietnam , have been uncritically parroting the administration 's distortions of events in Angola , Though some critical words have been read and heard this month  --  notably from CBS ? the reporting over the last fourteen years , since the start of the Angolan war of independence , could largely have been written in the White House . We have been told that the United States ' goal in Angola has been to counter Soviet influence  --  to prevent , as Tad Szulc put it in The New Republic earlier this month , " the emergence of a Soviet-controlled Angolan state . . . the first full-fledged Soviet satellite in Africa . " American unity with South Africa in fighting the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola ( MPLA ) and endorsing the joint anti-MPLA effort of two rival factions  --  an enterprise the Chinese once participated in , but from which they withdrew  --  has been portrayed as a fight for Angolan self-determination and against Soviet expansionism . Soviet military aid must be countered . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be balanced . So $50 million in secret aid is authorized . At least five American-piloted spotter planes fly over Angola . The Ford administration has stated that no troops , nor even any advisers , will be sent in after the arms , that our major interest there is " limited " and does not represent a major face-off with the USSR . " The recent statements have familiar echoes , " noted a New York Times writer . This reference to Vietnam is accurate , both in the nature of the anti-Communist , confrontation rhetoric being used and in the degree of distortion resorted to by the administration . Bits of fact countering Henry Kissinger 's Angola line have found their wayinto the media , tucked between uncritical reports of administration saber-rattling . Involvement in Angola goes back more than a decade . The Soviet Union has given support to the MPLA since 1961 , whereas the United States generally allied itself with Portuguese colonialism . , Whatever American anti-colonial aid has gone into Angola since the early 1960s , much of it through Zaire , was paid from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The latest round of escalation seems to have had a chronology at odds with that advanced by the administration . Oswald Johnston of the Los Angeles Times reports that , according to his intelligence sources , the " initial superpower decision to intervene in Angola may have been made in Washington . " Seymour Hersh reports in The New York Times that his sources say the CIA was first authorized to support both anti-MPLA factions in the spring . It was only after this initial American push , augmented in July , that the Soviet Union began the massive airlifts which the administration now denounces so self-righteously . The first Cubans arrived in September . Just when the South African invasion began is still uncertain , though it seems to have been well underway by some time in the autumn . There is evidence that the Afrikaners have been joined by Portuguese mercenaries disenchanted with the Lisbon government 's anti-colonial policies . It is mischievous to call the People 's Republic of Angola , declared by the MPLA forces in Luanda November 11 , a Soviet satellite . As George M. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York Times earlier this month , " After long years of combat against the Portuguese the Angolans will not easily accept dmiiination by a new foreign power . It is a gross and demeaning distortion of reality to present the men and women of the MPLA as Soviet puppets . And certainly the Cubans are not taking over Angola . " Even Szulc points out that the MPLA President , Dr. Agostinho Neto , " is a radical nationalist . . . there is no proof that he is a Communist . " But even if he were , that would not justify secret U.S. intervention . U.N . Ambassador Moynihan claims that what is at stake is a struggle to control vital tanker routes between Asia and Europe and asserts that the " Soviet Union with its proxy armies from Cuba has invaded the southwest region of Africa . " Framing the issue in this way ignores the colonial background out of which the struggle has emerged and the racial overtones it has assumed with the direct intervention of the Union of South Africa . What is needed is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the facts . Soviet and Cuban intervention is a fact , but there are others that ought to be made known . Until quite recently , the American news media , with a few exceptions , had been reluctant to provide them . Now at last some of the information about U.S. intervention is coming out . After Vietnam and the investigations of the CIA it is no longer quite so easy to involve the country in military adventures the causes and implications of which are not fully known to Congress and the public . So while it is encouraging that the press has suddenly begun to report the facts and that there are growing forces in the Congress Which seem determined to block further American involvement , Angola 's future is still far from resolved and demands continued accurate and detailed discussion in the press and the Congress . Bad Judgment , Again President Ford continues to choose poorly in his nominations to jobs in the executive branch ( see editorial , " Rejected Nominees , " The Nation , November 29 ) . His latest controversial selection ? Mitchell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposed by the Chicago Better Government Administration , a corruption-fighting organization . The association has compiled a fine record while engaged in the herculean task of cleaning up Chicago ; it deserves at least a hearing when it opposes a governmental appointee . And in this case especially , what it would say should be on the record , since Kobelinski seems to have engaged in some shady transactions with Floyd Fulle , a Cook County commissioner  --  since sentenced to a five-year term for other abuses of public office  --  in the association 's own bailiwick . According to J. Terrence Brunner , executive director of the Chicago group , Kobelinski was an officer in the Parkway Bank and Trust Co. when in 1966 the bank sold stock to Fulle , a Republican , after the county deposited with the bank $300,000 in interest-free funds . According to the Associated Press , Fulle had a say in which banks were to receive county funds . The commissioner was made a director of the bank ; the county thereupon doubled its interest-free funds on deposit . If not , illegal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " highly improper . " Kobelinski must have known of the " classical conflict of interest " involving Fulle , Brunner has said . Kobelinski 's involvement in such dubious business failed to deter President Nixon from appointing him to a directorship of the Export-Import Bank . By nominating him to head the SBA , a scandal-ridden agency under Nixon , Ford once again has shown miserable judgment . The alternative ? ossibility  --  that Ford did not trouble to have Kobelinski 's background investigated , and so was ignorant of his past connections  --  is even more distressing . The J. Edgar Hoover Collection H.H. Wilson , dour and doughty professor of politics at Princeton University , has initiated what promises to be a project of lasting significance in the field of civil liberties . Annoyed , as he has every right to be , with the inaccuracies , silliness and irrelevance of his personal FBI file , Wilson resolved that some means should be found to encourage the study of the folly it represents . The obvious first step would be to collect a representative sample of such file @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where it can be made available for inspection . So he has arranged for the Library , Princeton University , to act as the depository for personal FBI files . The initial response has been most encouraging . If a large number of such files can be deposited at Princeton , scholars and others will have a chance to study them in a leisurely way . Such studies should yield some interesting data : how accurate are the facts ? What is the percentage of error per file ? What do the files reveal about the sources used to obtain such information ? How pertinent have beenthe political " overviews " reflected in this file material ? How much , really , did the FBI ever know cabout the " Left " in American politics against which most , of its surveillance activities were directed ? - Original files need not be sent ; photocopies will be received . It should be relatively easy to acquire through donations enough file material to demonstrate how , over a period of several decades , a gullible electorate permitted politically illiterate agency personnel and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defaming citizens neither guilty of a crime nor suspected of or charged with criminal behavior . No better " home " for such material is likely to be found than the library at Princeton . As long as the only collection of such file material is in that " great brooding Bastille , " as Alan Barth described the new J. Edgar Hoover FBI Building ( The Washington Post ) it can not be studied en masse but a representative sample of files will suffice . Only now is the public beginning to sense what a dangerous agency the FBI became , in some of its activities , under Hoover 's dominance and direction . No President governed him , no Attorney General ruled him and , as Barth notes , " No Congress fixed boundaries for his roving authority " ? and that authority roamed very far indeed . Just ten years ago , 84 per cent of Americans surveyed by Gallup gave the FBI a " highly favorable " rating ; today only 37 per cent do so . A collection of the kind proposed for the Princeton Library @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the J. Edgar Hoover idolatry of the last several decades and the attendant dangers of a secret political police . Presented by Xerox The connection between advertisers and editorial content in most authentic journalistic enterprises is complex and normally latent . Direct advertiser interference in modern print journalism is hardly unknown but it is usually an aberration . In broadcasting , where unsponsored programs are the- rare exceptions , the connection is explicit . In public TV it has often been pervasive . While the connection between funding and programming has produced something less than an ideal situation , it has resulted in the broadcast of some material that would otherwise almost certainly not have been shown . The executives at Xerox , one of the more enlightened of American corporations in its advertising policies , boast of having made possible on CBS Fear on Trial and The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman , programs which , though hardly a threat to the dominant American structure , were unusual attempts at political television fare . Now , to " parallel what we do on TV , " as a Xerox vice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influence to the print media , specifically to Esquire . That magazine 's February issue will feature an additional 24 pages , thanks to Xerox 's largesse . Included , besides two full-page Xerox ads , will be the product of six months ' work by Harrison Salisbury : Travels , Through America . Xerox in essence paid Salisbury $40,000 plus $15,000 in expenses while retaining no editorial rights over the project . The company promised an additional $115,000 in 1976 advertising , at least in part to compensate for the production costs-of the 24 pages , if it liked the article . It did . Esquire Has , had its troubles this year  --  its ad pages are Off 29 per cent-and its revenues down slightly more than half that  --  yet , according to Advertising Age , " Apparently the venture offers little , if any , direct profit gain to the magazine . " But , the trade paper goes on , " Certainly , Mr. Salisbury 's work is likely to enhance Esquire 's sales appeal , " and its editor in chief , Arnold Gingrich , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of sponsor cooperation in the future . " Gingrich says he would not become involved in a partnership that would , say , involve an oil company and an article on energy politics . Esquire and Xerox executives reported on December 14 that they had heard no adverse reaction to their arrangement . " I suppose we can still expect some criticism , especially from journalism reviews , " said Esquire senior editor Lee Eisenberg , " but it will be largely unjustified . " He 's wrong . While Esquire is in many ways a good magazine and Salisbury a fine journalist of integrity , the arrangement is highly suspect . Salisbury no doubt wrote what he wanted to , uninfluenced by Xerox pressures , yet if Xerox executives had not liked his piece , Esquire would have been out $115,000 in advertising and forced to bear the costs of its publication . As Advertising Age put it , " skeptics immediately wondered if the unprecedented notion of specific magazine article sponsorship might not lead to new avenues of veiled propagandizing in the hands of lesser sponsors and magazines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ article sponsorship , a practice which would limit beyond current restrictions theideological variety of material found in most advertising-supported print media .

He is Blair Clark , a man of long experience in many forms of journalism , and politics as well .

ELIZABETH HOLTZMAN Washington The office of the Watergate Special Prosecutor was given the responsibility for conducting perhaps the most important criminal investigation in the history of the United States . Its mandate included prosecuting all crimes arising out of the break-in at the Democratic headquarters on June 17 , 1972 , and investigating criminal charges against Richard M. Nixon , then President of the United States and his staff or appointees . The Report of the Watergate Special Prosecution Force , issued on October 16 , is disappointing. * It fails to answer many of the old questions  --  including those that gave rise to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still do n't know who ordered the Watergate break-in , and why . And this report , unfortunately , raises many new questions about the thoroughness of the Special Prosecutor 's investigations and the soundness of some of his decisions not to , prosecute . " Was the investigation itself completed ? " remains an open question . Archibald Cox , the first Special Prosecutor , in response to a question at Senate Judiciary Committee hearings about the nature of the final report , pledged that " prosecutions would be brought where there is a proper basis for prosecution " and " the reasons for not bringing other prosecutions or reason for not indicting other figures .. . would . . . be included certainly in the final report . " He added that " all the facts with respect to individuals in high-office ought to be out . " It is difficult to imagine that the Senate would have accepted any lesser commitment from the Special Prosecutor . In fact , it is inconceivable that the Senate would have been satisfied had it been told that no prosecutions would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not disclose who ordered the break-in or why , and that the report would not even attempt to explain these failures . Distressingly , the , report abrogates the commitment Archibald Cox made to the United States Senate . More important , it fails to meet the reasonable expectations of the American public and the Congress that , when the Special Prosecutor 's investigations were completed , criminal responsibility would have been clearly pinpointed through the bringing of prosecutions , or that failure to assign criminal responsibility would have been clearly explained . The most serious defect of the report is that it does not allow the Congress and the public to judge whether a full , thorough investigation was in fact conducted . In this regard , it is noteworthy that after the report was issued the Special Prosecutor 's office reopened the investigation into corporate contributions because of disclosures that the Gulf Oil Corporation illegally contributed to Nixon 's 1972 re-election campaign , as well as to well-known Democratic and Republican officeholders . In order to assess whether the Special Prosecutor did conduct a full investigation , we need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tape recordings  --  the most important and probative evidence available . Unfortunately , the report is silent on whether the Special Prosecutor obtained all such tapes , or even if he sought to obtain them . In another instance , we are unable to judge the degree of investigative thoroughness because the description of the $100,000 that was contributed by Howard Hughes and held by Bebe Rebozo is so cursory. , According to the Senate Select Committee report , Rebozo refused to produce for the committee a number of financial records . Were these materials obtained by the Watergate Special Prosecution Force ? No prosecutions ensued in this case . The Senate committee was thwarted in its attempt to obtain relevant information about this and other matters when Thomas Wakefield , a lawyer who represented both Rebozo and Nixon , asserted the attorney-client privilege . Was his full testimony obtained by the Special Prosecutor ? If not , was it because the Special Prosecutor failed to challenge his claim of privilege ? If that is the case , why was the claim unchallenged ? On September 21 , The New f6i-ic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were never obtained and that Bebe Rebozo and Robert Abplanalp were never called before the grand jury . If that story is accurate , the Special Prosecutor should explain what happened . The report should have given us enough information to determine if the Hughes-Rebozo matter was properly investigated  --  and it could have done so without compromising the parties ' rights . ' . It may well be that the Special Prosecutor conducted a comprehensive , complete , relentless investigation of all the matters falling within his jurisdiction . But one would never know it from this report alone , and we are entitled to the assurance . The central lesson that Watergate taught is that neither the public nor the Congress should be required to accept on faith that public officials do their jobs . In my judgment , another serious inadequacy in the report is its failure to describe the Investigation of criminal charges against Richard Nixon . We know that on September 3 , 1974 , the Special Prosecutor was investigating ten areas of Richard Nixon 's possible criminal liability , but the report is silent on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or did they instead abruptly halt when the pardon was issued ? The Special Prosecutor has no basis for refusing to disclose whether these investigations were completed . His failure to do so is puzzling indeed . Aside from mentioning Mr. Nixon 's status as an unindicted co-conspirator in the Watergate cover-up , the report does not describe his complicity in criminal activity nor does it exonerate him of any charges . The Special Prosecutor may certainly raise a number of serious arguments against disclosing information about individuals who were never prosecuted , but these arguments are not persuasive in the case of a President who accepted a pardon , thus precluding criminal prosecution , and tacitly acknowledging his guilt . The Supreme Court has determined that a public official 's right to privacy about matters directly connected to the discharge of his official duties is severely restricted when the public 's right to know about such conduct is invoked . . The Special Prosecutor told a House Judiciary Subcommittee in January 1975 that a fuller report from his office was neither necessary nor desirable , inasmuch as voluminous disclosures would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Act . The Special Prosecutor misses the point . The issue is not only whether the information will become public but how soon and in what form . The litigation on the constitutionality of the tapes legislation has not even reached the Supreme Court . Even if the Act is upheld , the General Services Administration estimates that / the first set of documents will not see the light until three years after the Supreme Court 's decision . Finally , the public needs guidance through this welter of materials . The Special Prosecutor , a nonpartisan official with a broad mandate , has a special credibility . He alone can answer the public need for a nonpartisan account of official misdeeds . Thus , another serious shortcoming of the report is its failure to explain convincingly why prosecutions were not brought in certain circumstances . For example , I am perplexed by the report 's account of the decision not to prosecute in connection with the submission of incomplete transcripts to the House Judiciary Committee . The report claims that no criminal intent could be found . The Special Prosecutor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the House Judiciary Committee and its ranking Republican member to verify the transcripts submitted to the committee was a bona fide offer . The report concludes : " All the available evidence indicated that the verification offer made by the White House to the committee was made with the full expectation that the offer might indeed be accepted . " The relevant question is not whether the offer would be accepted but whether , if accepted , it could , have resulted in verification . The report , surprisingly , assumes so , although the House Judiciary Committee rejected the White House offer after a full discussion about why the offer was unlikely to produce verification . The problems the committee raised then are still valid : ( 1 ) The authenticity and completeness of the tapes heard could not be verified , since no technical experts would be allowed to examine them . ( 2 ) The time factor involved in having two people listen to the tapes  --  even assuming that all tapes had indeed been presented  --  was unrealistically long . The Nixon verification offer covered twenty-three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 1,308 pages of typed transcript . A former Judiciary Committee staff member has said that a " conservative estimate " of the time it took the staff to transcribe the eight tapes submitted to the committee in October 1973 , was two hours per minute of tape. * At that rate , had Chairman Rodino and ranking minority member Hutchinson undertaken to verify the transcripts  --  doing nothing but listen for eight hours a day , five days a week  --  verification would have taken two years . They would still be listening to the tapes today . The impeachment inquiry would not have been resumed until President Nixon 's term had expired . To accept such an offer as bona fide simply strains credulity . Another questionable explanation for a failure to prosecute is given in regard to the investigation of so-called " national security wiretaps . " The report states that no prosecution occurred for any wiretap that might at any time have been construed as related to national security . This is a dubious policy because the report itself concedes that there was " room to contend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to an impermissible domestic political goal . " It is not clear whether this excessive prosecutorial caution springs from prudence or a desire to establish a perfect win-loss record . Even more disturbing , the report states that no prosecutions were brought for two wiretaps that were wholly unrelated to national security from the outset . In these instances , the report claims there was " insufficient evidence to bring criminal charges , particularly when weighed against other matters under inquiry by WSPF Watergate Special Prosecution Force as to some of the subjects of the wiretap investigation . " What does this statement mean ? How can there be " insufficient evidence , particularly when weighed against " something else ? If insufficient evidence existed , there was no point in weighing the matter further . If sufficient evidence existed , what " other matters " would have warranted dropping charges involving such a serious infringement of civil liberties ? This smoke screen of words raises serious doubt about the legitimacy of the Prosecutor 's dedsion . The report outlines another decision which , to me , has disturbing implications  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convicted of a " serious crime . " I do not advocate the unsavory prosecutorial tactic of " overcharging " a defendant with every possible offense in order to force a favorable plea bargain . But that is quite different from ignoring separate and distinct episodes of criminal conduct , as the Special Prosecutor tells us he did . The only justification given for this policy is that concur : rent sentences would probably have resulted from prosecuting the same person for several different crimes . But concurrent sentences are not imposed in every case . Also , what if the single " serious " conviction is reversed on appeal ? This policy produces a situation in which a public official who commits twenty crimes receives no more black marks on his public record than an official who commits only one . So deceptive is this policy that the public can not tell if failure to prosecute resulted from too little evidence or from too much . For the Special Prosecutor , speed and efficiency seem to justify the policies of single prosecutions and extensive plea bargaining . But one must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ official crime consequently lost to the public , and the damage to the important civic sense that justice has been done . Perhaps the real reason for the thinness of the report lies in a casual remark made to me by Special Prosecutor Henry Ruth . He said that full disclosure was less than important because the American public ( except , perhaps , in my district ) , had rapidly lost interest in Watergate . I found that remark deeply troubling . The Special Prosecutor 's mandate was to pursue the responsibilities of his office regardless of pressure from anyone  --  the President ? r the opinion polls . Also , I do not think that Americans are indifferent to efforts to bring high public officials to justice . One could detail a host of further inadequacies in the report , the sum of which may create the impression that we still operate a dual system of justice in this country  --  one for the highly placed and one for the thousands of ordinary citizens convicted of crimes .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
