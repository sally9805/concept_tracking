The book has the same size , feel and illustrated mini-encyclopedia format as the author 's last two manuals , The Joy of Sex and More Joy of Sex . But this time British Author Alex Comfort , 56 , is trying for a pop bestseller on old age , not sexual hydraulics . A Good Age ( Crown ; $9.95 ) is Comfort 's attack on " agism " - prejudice against the elderly , which he considers society 's most stupid bias . After all , the elderly are the only outcast group that everyone eventually expects to join . " I wonder , " says Comfort , " what Archie Bunker would say about Puerto Ricans if he knew he was going to become one on his next birthday . " <P> To Comfort , a gerontologist and author of two previous books on aging , the chief disability of old age is agism itself . " Most of the handicaps of oldness in our society are social , conventional and imaginary . The physical changes are trifling by comparison . " Because of " redneck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the elderly are patronized , overmedicated and arbitrarily excluded from any significant social roles . <P> No Decline . In fact , he says , the elderly are " simply people who have been here longer " and are no less creative or mentally intact than anyone else . Though the elderly are more prone to chronic diseases , they get fewer acute illnesses than the general population ; a person over 65 has an average of 1.3 acute illnesses a year , compared with 2.1 a year for all ages . Comfort cites a Duke University study showing that about half of a group of people over 65 who returned for periodic checkups had no detectable physical decline over periods ranging from three to 13 years . Nor are new emotional and mental disorders very likely in old age : true senility is uncommon , and only 1% of the elderly can expect to become demented . Says Comfort : " The human brain does not shrink , wilt , perish or deteriorate with age. * It normally continues to function well through as many as nine decades . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people are not biological effects of aging . " They are the results of role playing ... They the aging are supposed to be physically and intellectually infirm . " Example : many old people are uncertain , meandering drivers because they are expected to be , just as many women come to adopt the male notion of the dithering woman driver . " Older , fit drivers are the least dangerous on the road , " writes Comfort . " By 70-plus you have experience , and the accident-prone fraction of the population is dead or disqualified . " <P> Clearly intent on consciousness raising among the elderly , Comfort urges those over 65 to take no guff about their age . One of his encyclopedia entries is titled " Dignity . Stand on this . ( See Pulling Rank . ) " He advises " bloody-mind-edness " ( " Be ruthless to rudeness . " " Show you expect respect " ) . Any use of titles such as Pop or Granny must be punished . " Point out acidly that you have a name and if they do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you were earning a living when they were still eating baby food . "
