It was the last contest of the 1954 World Series , and the New York Giants had a deciding 3-0 edge in games over the Cleveland Indians . Cleveland had two outs and a man on third when the batter drove a long fly ball to deep center field . Willie Mays made one of his patented " basket " catches . Thinking there was only one out , he then wound up and fired a perfect strike to Catcher Wes Westrum at home plate in hopes of catching the runner trying for home ( who was already dejectedly trotting toward the dugout ) . A Cleveland sportswriter turned to the boys in the press box and said : " Well , we 've finally found Mays ' weakness . He ca n't count ! " <P> True . There were no weaknesses in Willie Mays ' career except a refusal to count the years . But last week he had to add up 42 of them , complete with fluid-swollen knees that had to be drained almost daily , an agonizing shoulder that would not let him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Maybe I 'll cry tomorrow , " Mays said , but he finally decided to hang it up after 22 resplendent years in baseball . <P> Mays was the last of the superstars who could do everything with consummate grace and skill . It was only fitting that he wind up his career with the Mets in New York , where two generations of ghetto kids have practiced basket catches and echoed his favorite cry , " Say hey ! " through the streets of Harlem . <P> Willie Mays , season after luminous season , made myths come alive and heroes , American-style , believable.
