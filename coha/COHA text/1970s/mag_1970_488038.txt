DEAR SIRS : In regard to your studious avoidance of the term " Fascist " to describe the current American scene l " Cold Comfort , " editorial , Oct 5 , I call your attention to Carl Oglesby 's thoughts on the matter , from " V:etnamese Crucible " in Containment and Change : One sees in America the emergence ( maybe it is too late for such a word ) of what we can only describe as a somewhat permissive , domestically benign Fascist state . Fascism  --  an extravagant term ? Webster 's defirntiOn ? " a centralized autocratic national regime with severely nationalistic policies , exercising regimentation of industry , commerce , and finance , rigid censorship , and forcible suppression of opposition . " On the- last two counts , I hope not too hopefully , I defer judgment . And in any case , there is no need to suppress an already harmless dissent . But centralization of the basic economic and political decisions , the sophisticated nationalism of our foreign policy , the de facto top-down regimentation ( our word for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and finance  --  these are very clearly the dominant features of our system Big government and big business are essentially one and the same . . : . The crucial competition takes place on the inside of a homogeneous , informal , but very real and very bureaucratic commercial monolith , 1 and the paramount issue of that competition is the-internal succession of power and authority : not where power will be moved to but who will win occupancy of power 's present ! seats ; not the rearrangement of power in the market place , but the acquisition of power within the closed system that commands it . If it walks like a duck , etc. , it can still be a duck without being the most grotesque example in history . Michael Miller teachers ' grapevine New York City DEAR SIRS .

Berman , Coordinator correction In " The Democrats : Spooked by Abstractions " The Nation , Oct. 5 Robert Sherrill said ? " Not long ago Stephen Schlesinger invited members of the temporary steering committee of the New Democratic Coalition to comment in a symposium on the question : Should we have a fourth party , or can the Democratic Party be reformed by 1972 ? " Mr. Schlesinger has written to say that the symposium was conducted by The New Democrat , the magazine of which he is editor , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committee ( though some were ) and that the magazine is an independent political journal and not affiliated with the NDC . The Editors EDITORIALS The Agnew Purge The liberal Republicans in the Senate would like to believe that the Nixon-Agnew attempt to read Sen. Charles Goodell out of the party is merely a special case . It is so in the sense that Senator Goodell , caught in a three-way race , is especially vulnerable . But Senators Brooke , Case , Hatfield and Percy must realize that if the purge of Goodell succeeds , they can expect similar treatment in 1972 when all of them will be up for re-election . The signal is clear : get right with Nixon-Agnew-Mitchell between now ' and then , or else . Sen. Hugh Scott is in no danger , but even so it should be noted that the President makes a point of relying more on Sen. Robert Dole than he does on the nominal Republican leader . Liberal Republicans up for re-election in 1972 must also have noticed the decline in influence at the White House of Robert Finch and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the President bypassed Gov . Dan EVans and other liberal Republicans in the state of Washington in order to insure the re-election of Senator Jackson , a Democrat . In Vermont , Sen. Winston Prouty and in New Jersey , Nelson G. Gross , the Republican nominee , find themselves torn , as The New York Times points out , between an Administration that tends to the right of Center and electorates that tend to the left . Of course , President Nixon does not relish the notion of splitting the Republican Party more than it is already split in states with a sizable liberal Republican element , but if , as he envisions , the GOP is to become the new majority party made up exclusively of conservative white centrists , then the liberal Republicans are expendable . As they are booted out , so the argument runs:conservative Democrats will be drawn in . What has happened in California may well prefigure'the future . Former Sen. Thomas Kuchel , the foremost liberal Republican in the Senate until he was-defeated for renomination by Max Rafferty , has now made his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Republican Party in his state . Or consider the June primary campaigns of Rep. Paul N. ( " Pete " ) McCloskey and Rep. Alphonzo Bell . Both are liberal Republicans ; both are attractive politicians who might go far in California state politics . This year right-wing elements poured money into a concerted effort to deny them Republican nominations . Fortunately the effort failed , in part because the districts involved  --  the 11th ( McCloskey ) and the 28th ( Bell ) ? are not densely populated with Reagan-Rafferty elements ; but neither McCloskey nor Bell has much of a future in state politics as a Republican . Elsewhere , as liberal Republicans veer to the right , which many of them are doing , they will no longer be able to enjoy the best of two worlds  --  that is , to curry conservative support simply by being ' Republicans and to pick up other support on carefully selected " liberal " issues . Time is running out on that ploy . Let them ponder the fate of Kuchel and the attempted purge of Goodell , McCloskey and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received in San Francisco in the and in Miami in 1968 . And let them also study the polls which show Mayor John F. Lindsay a runner-up with Senator Muskie for the Democratic nomination in 1972 . The liberal Republican category includes some fine political talent which the nation can ill afford to lose , but it is clear that politicians such as Senators Brooke , Hatfield , , Percy and Case have little to look forward to in the Republican Party of Richard Nixon . Will such men wait to be purged , or will they take the lead , between , now and 1972 , in forming a new coalition with independents and like-minded Democrats  --  now that an exodus of Dixiecrats just might " liberate " the Democratic Party ? The Crawfisher Zoologically , the crawfish , or crayfish , is a small fresh-'water member of the lobster family . Used as a verb , crawl ' fish means to retreat obliquely from a position or under , ? , taking . The connotations are invidious . The columnists ? Frank Mankiewicz and Tom Braden have converted the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  the craw fisher . An active example is the ever ebullient Hubert H. Humphrey . One takes no pleasure in thus citing him , for , whatever one may think of his politics , he is personally a able man . He smiles almost constantly , except when he is g. crying  --  which he also does easily . He honestly empathizes with the poor , the aged , the sick and other unfortunates . He is the kind of man of whom one says , sometimes patronizingly , that he " has a good heart . " But he has always been a crawfisher , and an agile one . The current instance of skittering is his discovery that he and his wife Muriel love to hunt . Humphrey the Hunter ! And Mrs. Humphrey ! Maybe she does like to hunt , though anyone who has exs , ' changed even ' a few words with her finds it difficult to imagine her firing a gun at an inoffensive animal . But Hubert is running for office , and almost automatically he crawfishes on gun control . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or shotgun under his arm ( perhaps both at once ) , stalking grouse ' , pheasants , deer , bear and National Rifle Association voters . Most politicians have a bit of the crawfisher in them ; our traditional modes of political action being what they are , one must allow the practicing politician room for dodging . But beyond that reasonable latitude the crawfisher becomes a menace to good government . Richard Niebuhr once said that there was nothing wrong per se about compromise ; the trouble is that most people compromise too soon . Even worse , then , are those who compromise , or crawfish , on a serious matter of principle , and lack even the excuse that they would have suffered damage had they not . What made Mr. Humphrey think he had to crawfish on guns ? A majority of the electorate favors gun-control legiglation . The National Rifle Association and perhaps 20 per cent of the voters are opposed . But they make a lot of noise , and thereby frighten politicians who frighten easily . In contrast , the ADA was completely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the 100-member board , a resolution not to support candidates who move to the right . For one ' y ' thing , there is no firm evidence that the country is moving ? in that direction . It may simply appear to be so moving , because Agnew , Mitchell , et al. , keep telling us so . And even if there actually is such a trend , what remains of the THE NATION/October 26 , 1970 function of a progressive organization if it helps to turn the trend into a stampede ? We have seen this happen before , and the results are with us still . In 1950 the Congress passed the Subversive Activities Control Act in a flurry of hysteria . HHH was for it , but he hardly deserves to be singled out ; only Estes Kefauver-7thrum et venerabile nomenl  --  voted against it . We are saddled with the Act to this day . Now the Organized Crime Control Act has been sent to the President for signature . When it first came before the Senate it whizzed through , 73 to 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of responsibility to vote against it . The crime bill is to this period what the subversive activities bill was to the fifties . Many of those who voted for the crime bill knew it to be what it is  --  a dangerous phony with totalitarian overtones . They say they are voting for it because no legislator dares refrain from declaring himself against " organ- , ized crime , " just as none dared vote against ? a ' measure designed to scourge the Communists in 1950 . The earlier Act did no great damage to the Communists , but contributed substantially to the atmosphere of hate and demoralization in which we now find ourselves . The Organized Crime Control Act will do little damage to organized criminals , but the Bill of Rights will feel it . The answer to demagogy is to force a discussion of the real issues , and always to bear in mind that a workable democracy can withstand only a certain level of crawfishing . Smoke-Screen Veto The Nation would welcome some action  --  almost any action  --  by the Administration that would merit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one string . Journalism reflects life and is subject to the proverb about variety . But the President seems determined to balk us . He has just vetoed the bill to limit campaign spending . He acknowledges that the issue is important . It had substantial bipartisan backing . Earlier attempts to limit campaign spending have not been effective , and this one might not have worked either . But it might have had some positive effect ; at any rate it would have been an experiment worth making . The history preceding the veto is instructive . The Administration played almost no role in shaping this piece of legislation . It did not offer changes which might have improved the bill ; it played no lobbying role of consequence . Then , when the bill came to him , the President vetoed it . His complaint was that it " plugs one hole in a sieve . " For one thing , the metaphor is an exaggeration ; nor is anything said about what might be done to replace the sieve by something less leaky . " The veto , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong action . This is not the way the parliamentary game should be played in a decently ordered democracy . Nor is the procedure honest . The veto says nothing about the equal-time amendment . Why ? In 1964 , the equal-time provision , part of an Act which had passed the House and Senate just as this bill did , was killed by Lyndon B. Johnson . He killed it because he was the incumbent . He was well ahead ; he did not want to be trapped into a debate ; he did not want to help Goldwater in any way . The same action , in substance , Was repeated by the Republicans in 1968 . Nixon was ahead in the polls and did not want to be led into a debate of the kind that had done him nothing but harm when he faced Kennedy in 1960 . Mr. Nixon will probably be the incumbent in 1972 . Presumably he will be better known than his Democratic opponent . The GOP can raise more money , with less effort , than can the Democrats , who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Nixon in a position to spend more but he does n't mind if he has to pay a higher rate for the tele.L vision time . So , while we have not been able to find something nice to say about Mr. Nixon , we have at least managed to give him an even break . In this area he has acted no differently than did his DemoOratic predecessor  --  which suggests that On this issue all incumbents think alike . Democratic Straw California Democrats have found a straw to clutch in that state 's newest voter-registration statistics  --  fragile but factual : the Republicans have slipped . It 's small , but it looms more importantly than the marginal gain Democrats have made . ' Statewide figures show that Democrats  --  for thirty-five years the party favored by well over the majority in California  --  picked up nearly 400,000 new voters just between June and September 15 . These are people not previously registered , a large proportion of them from minority communities . The gain inched the Democratic 4 majority ahead from 54.5 per cent where it stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for this November . Cheers ? Not exactly . The figure they were aiming for in an impressive registration drive , coordinated with COPE 's effort , was 57 per cent . The two occasions in this century when Democrats have managed to capture the governorship in California ( Governors Olson and Brown ) were when the Democratic share of the registration total topped 57 per cent . It has been skidding downhill since Ronald Reagan won , so there is some sunshine in the current fractional improvement . - But the real glow for the Democrats is shed by GOP figures . The Republicans slipped from 40.7 per cent of the electorate in June to 39.8 per cent this fall , and that despite the fact that they too had been industriously adding 01 : new voters to the rolls . They added about half as many as the Democrats , roughly 200,000 . This is the first time in the past four years that Democrats improved their position at the expense of Republicans . Getting the GOP margin below 40 per cent may be the start of a trend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is . The state 's voter total is 8.7 million . Of this Democrats are 4,781,282 ; Republicans , 3,469,046 . Lurking behind these official ratios , though , is another spark of arithmetical hope for Democrats . It involves tidied up registrar rolls , Some 400,000 voters who have moved since th  --  y last voted have been snatched back to proper voter status by an intensive effort to get these mobile Californians to re-register , which they now can do by mail if their move occurred within their original county . In this curious state , full of comings and goings , that is the prevailing pattern . In Los Angeles County , for every person moving away from the county , three other persons move to new abodes inside the county . k , And Democrats figure their share of the transient , shifting , work-seeking residents runs 2 to 1 in excess of mobile Republicans . The new law allowing re-registration by mail , and the fact that 90 per cent of all California counties have computerized their registration rolls so that deadwood is combed out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a segment of the voter population usually lost by indifference after a change of domicile . By this sophis-r , ticated reach for voters normally washed out , Democrats figure they have a better actual ratio than official figures disclose . But Bernard Teitlebaum , consultant with the Democratic state Senate caucus who engineered that party 's voter drive , concedes the whole effort could be nullified by apathy . Despite the heaviest unemplOyment lb- ratio in the nation , Californians have n't shown signs of election excitement on either side . Of course the significant trend may not lie in the ' major parties at all , but in the political anonymity of those who register but " decline to state " a party preference . Workers in the field were struck by the number of young people , tf new voters , who scoffed at allying themselves with either party . The number of " declined to state " increased nearly 100 per cent , from 2.2 per cent of the electorate in June to 3.9 per cent now , about the highest in more than a decade . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the growing proportion of the adult population which is eligible to vote but has never registered . In 1960 , when California had some 9.5 million adults in the population , there were about 7.5 million registered voters , 2 million others being lost . Today , with 11.9 million eligible adults , only 8.7 million are registered voters , leaving some 3 million out of the system . MARY ELLEN LEARY ) Dissent in the USSR The top Soviet leadership has a problem on its hands ' and it is no minor one . The award of the Nobel Prize in literature to Aleksandr I. Solzhenitsyn only serves to call attention to the underlying situation . The prize was awarded to Pasternak in 1958 for Doctor Zhivago , but Pasternak had his arm twisted by Khrushchev and declined to accept it . In 1965 , perhaps as a tactful gesture , the Nobel Prize went to Sholokhov for And Quiet Flows the Don . Whatever Sholokhov 's merits and defects as a novelist , he has never quarreled with the regime . Now the 1970 prize goes to Solzhenitsyn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his arduous struggle for intellectual freedom in the Soviet Union . The Soviet authorities might turn this latest award to their advantage . They could reiterate their disapproval of some of the laureate 's ideas , but still allow , him to go to Stockholm to claim the prize and air his views . This is feasible only if they are willing to relax to some degree the restraints under which artists and intellectuals now .111 labor in the Soviet Union . But it is time these restraints were relaxed , for today the opposition has assumed a new form . For the first time it exists as a movement , conscious of itself , with specific objectives and specific tactics , and with a strategy of working within the norms of legality , openly and with full publicity . In a recent piece in The Listener , Stuart Hood suggests that the movement dates from the opposition to the trials of Daniel and Sinyaysky in 1966 . The movement has a publication , Chronicle of Current Events , the first issue of which appeared in ' April 1968 . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not otherwise reported in the Soviet press  --  matters such as political trials , underground publications , and arrests and raids . The movement , known as the Action Group for Civil Rights , came into being , as an organized group , in May 1969 . Much of Hood 's evaluation , in common with other writings on dissent in the USSR , is necessarily conjectural . But the fact is , as David T. Cattell of the University of California , Los Angeles , points out in Current History , ' that the Soviet Union has created one of the most highly educated elites in the world , and this elite is showing definite signs of demanding to lie heard . It is one thing to put a few intellectuals in prison ; it is something entirely , different when key scientists and mathematicians and engineers begin to demand a larger measure of intellectual freedom . These academicians know about nuclear bombs and related matters of the highest priority . But if scientists invest the protest with a new significance , the writers , as always in the USSR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Nobel committee is precise and apt : Solzhenitsyn is being honored " for the ethical force with which he has pursued the indispensable traditions of Russian literature . " From Leo Tolstoy to Solzhenitsyn , under the czars and under the commissars , writers have kept the tradition of artistic and inte/lectual freedom alive in Russia . It is notable that the official reaction to the Nobel award was not to attack the author but to complain that the Swedes employed political , not literary , criteria . The Soviet leaders should permit Solzhenitsyn to visit Stockholm on December 10 , there to be honored in person . Whether they realize it or not , the Soviets face , as a recent issue of the Chronicle puts it , the " beginning of an irreversible process of self-liberation . " Keeping Solzhenitsyn from Stockholm will not arrest this process . Be It Known The U.S. Senate , our most distinguished legislative body , has placed itself in a peculiar position by rejecting , 60 to 5- , the findings of The Presidential Commission on Obscenity and Pornography that exposure to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crime . The findings of any commission are a body of alleged facts , put together by presumed experts . One may dispute the facts and challenge the credentials of the experts , but the Senate has not so proceeded . Stimulated by Senator McClellan ( D. , Ark. ) , it declares the commission in cahoots with the merchants of smut ( which reflects seriously on the judgment of President Johnson , who appointed its members ) , and then attempts to refute its findings by a show of hands . The Senate has decided  --  or believes its constituencies have decided  --  that pornography corrupts , and it will vote down anyone who presents evidence to the contrary . When we are not denouncing the Russians as a menace to world tranquillity , we entertain ourselves by laughing at the naivete of their logical procedures . There was much merriment , not long ago , over Lysenko 's genetic theories , a body of pseudo-science imposed on the Russians by decree of Stalin . It was true because Stalin said it was true ? how absurd . But now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produces perverts who commit horrid crimes , because the Senate says it does . Now who 's laughing ?
