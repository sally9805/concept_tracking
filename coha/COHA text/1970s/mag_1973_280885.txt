The Lightning Strikes <P> Sir / When we heard of the resignation of Vice President Agnew , we could not have been any more shocked if a streak of lightning had hit us . We were guilty of criticizing TIME and other news media for their factual reporting and must now eat crow . <P> Now what ? I often said , if we can not trust Mr. Agnew , whom can we trust in Government ? It would be frightening if all political officeholders were thoroughly investigated-for we might not have a Government at all . <P> EDWARD J. JOHNSON <P> Palm Desert , Calif . <P> Sir / If former Vice President Agnew really had " the best interests of the nation " in mind when he resigned , why did n't he do so before he divided the country into pro-and anti-Agnew camps with his constant protestations of innocence ? <P> PETER STANWOOD <P> Oxford , Ohio <P> Sir / Well , it looks like spiroagnew was a disease after all . <P> ALLAN CROWTHER <P> Elmhurst , Ill . <P> Sir / Normally when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I bought what Mr. Agnew had to say . Now I want my money back . <P> JIM FALIN <P> Tacoma , Wash . <P> Sir / I 'll never go to the races with Nixon . All he does is pick the losers . <P> SUSAN BAUM <P> Washington , D.C. <P> Sir / Mr. Agnew has now done what he can do for his country . <P> Mr. Nixon is still asking what his country can do for him . <P> BRIAN DELAHANTY <P> Burlington , Vt . <P> Sir / I applaud Agnew for haying the courage to resign . It is too bad Nixon wo n't do the same and make it a majority . We need more people like ... what 's his name ? <P> RON QUINN <P> Marshall , Mich . <P> Sir / Why is Agnew resigning when we all know that Nixon 's the one ? <P> MAGGIE MCCOMAS <P> Brussels <P> Sir / No greater disservice can be done to our system of constitutional democracy than to demonstrate , as the Justice Department has in this instance , that there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ordinary citizen . To call the Justice Department 's handling of the Agnew case " just , fair and honorable " is to make a mockery of justice , fairness and honor . <P> The future of American constitutional democracy is endangered much less by the activities of a few politicians like Mr. Agnew than it is by the mockery of justice that characterizes the present Administration 's response to such activities . <P> JOHN H. HALLOWELL <P> Professor of Political Science <P> Duke University <P> Durham , N.C. <P> Sir / Mr. Agnew 's prediction that he would not receive fair treatment in the courts has proved to be true . His punishment for a felony is a mockery of fairness and proves that " justice for all " really means " justice for most , unwarranted mercy for a few .
