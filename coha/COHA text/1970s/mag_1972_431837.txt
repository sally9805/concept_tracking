 | They 're not just toys anymore , Kites Go Scientific Flying kites is serious business these days . Scientists are using them to learn about weather making as well as weather forecasting . NASA scientists use them in aligning Navy tracking radars , to help guide Apollo spaceships back to safe landings . Special nonrigid versions are being developed for use as gliding parachutes , both for pilot ejection from damaged fighter planes and for controlled cargo drops into hostile territories . Your bonus ? The fallout from this research is advanced designs that make kites more fun than ever to fly . Kiting is no longer just a backyard pastime for kids , but a fast-growing hobby for men fascinated by the mysterious skies and bird-like flight . I recently surveyed new space-age kite designs ? mostly on Bermuda beaches , where the winds are unusually steady . As you might expect , new rugged plastics and plasticized papers are being used for surfaces . But more interesting is the startling variety of new shapes in the sky . You can get kites for light or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and some that hover like hawks . Some are specifically designed to be load lifters . And a new generation of two-string controllable kites is designed specifically for aerobatics and controlled kite fighting . The new kite scene has five basic  | types : deltas , sleds , parawings , parafoils , and inflatables . The delta . There are many variations , but essentially the shape is like the triangular or swept-back wing of a supersonic plane . Usually , there are three rigid sticks coming together to a point at the leading edge . There is considerable flexibility in the fabric or plastic sheet connecting , so that the sticks at the trailing edge will vary in distance from each other depending on the amount of wind and pull . Some , like the Gayla , have a center keel ? another delta , which provides directional stability and bears the attaching ring for the line . Others , like the Glite , have no keel . Deltas are probably the most popular of the new commercial kites . They can be made to look like birds , planes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that they usually zoom up almost directly overhead . Bird kites . Possibly the most exciting new " floaters " I 've flown are a series put out by the Airplane Kite Co. , 1702 W. 3rd St. , Roswell , N.M . 88201 . These are among several novel designs by Ray Holland Jr. , an MIT aeronautical engineer . The birds are aerodynamically balanced , can even do a slow glide ? maintaining stability when dropped by hand . Flown at the end of a string , they hold a correct angle of attack to the wind without a special bridle , keel , or even a long rag tail . Each sweeps around the sky with the string drooping below in a long bow . As the kite changes direction with slight wind shifts it has the uncanny look of a live hawk shifting easily from side to side as it searches for prey . Do n't fly this design near turkey or chicken farms . The realistic action could panic a flock . The parawing or Flexikite . Designed @# @# by Francis Rogallo , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parawing has no rigid wood or plastic members , but it does need a fairly rigid center crease for its keel . The rest of the shape is held by bridles . It is , like the delta , a high flier , and it needs a tail . Its great beauty is its ability to shrink and expand its direct surface area to the wind according to the forces it meets . Strong gusts make it pull itself together . Then when the wind slacks , it spreads out to get more lift in light air . Parawings have been designed for space vehicles and as ejection chutes for fighters ( to give the pilot a chance to glide away from enemy territory or dangerous obstacles ) , and have even been powered with engines to become " fleeps . " The basic kite is tricky to make and to fly ? not for the casual kiter . The Scott sled . Designed by Walter Scott , its side keels make it look something like a snow sled ? hence its name . It has only vertical stiffening , usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A variation on this is one kite I found which has three inflatable tubes that run vertically parallel to each other and act as stiffening . This one also has a double-slotted back that puffs out like an airplane wing to provide lift somewhat in the manner of the Jalbert parafoil described later . The Scott sled has a triangular vent about two-thirds to the bottom . and this seems to be important for flight stability . The sled has a twostring bridle ; the bridle-string length is critical . A lateral stiffener is sometimes used to keep the sled from collapsing in gusty conditions . The sled usually flies at a high angle , which means it can do well in light winds . .  | @# Ray Holland claims his Sky Sail design , which looks something like a Scott Sled without the center vent , can lift as much for its weight as any heavier-than-air lifting system . The parafoil . Conceived by Domina Jalbert of Boca Raton , Fla. , this is the most fascinating kite design I know . It 's like an airplane wing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basic idea while flying one day in his Beech Bonanza and thinking about how the wing worked . In the air , Jalbert 's parafoil looks like a flying mattress . But on close examination , you can see it 's a wingshaped fabric with individual longitudinal cells between each rib . Rigging and paneling along the bottom of each rib hold the bottom section flat . The upper section takes an airfoil shape because of wind pressure . To keep sections from collapsing in gusts or side shifts , Jalbert designed slots to keep the air from escaping too fast . Once aloft , the parafoil has startling lift , and it 's a very tough bird . As a result , big models are used in weather-making research in the Rockies . They carry large loads of instruments and seeding materials into extremely turbulent weather that might wreck planes , gliders , or helicopters trying to do the same job . Jalbert questions the general opinion that March is the kite month . " This may be true when the winds are between eight and 15 mph . Above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ velocity into which an average kite can be flown is highly dependent on the type and design of the kite . For example , a Scott Sled will fly in very light winds , while a French war kite requires high winds . For each kite , there is a minimum and maximum wind velocity at which pleasant operation can be performed . The very low wind can be as frustrating as the too high wind . " At what angle should a kite be rigged for best performance ? " My experience is , when suspended from the bridle junction , a kite should have an angle of 30 to 35 degrees . This means that this type rig on a kite will fly well at angles of 60 to 70 degrees to the vertical , which is good for any kite-flying . Now the higher the angle of flight , the less pull there is on the flying line , because past 60 or 70 degrees the angle of attack becomes negative , and the kite will gently settle back to normal flying position . Rigging a kite at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Should a kite have a tail ? Jalbert likes a plain kite with a long , light , @# waving tail that offers lots of air friction to counterbalance the dynamic pressure of the kite surface . The higher the winds , the more dynamic force ; therefore , more tail is required . It is the friction of the ajr that gives stability . A short , heavy tail simply acts as a pendulum and makes the kite fly erratically . How about the tailless kite ? Jalbert points out that all of the successful ones have a built-in fin . The fin acts as a lateral stabilizer , like the rudder on a plane . Adding a long tail to the normally tailless kite helps it fly in higher-than-normal winds . Jalbert points out that any kite is purely dependent on the plane surface area for dynamic force . A kite that is wider than it is long ( high aspect ratio ) has more difficulty maintaining lateral stability if it is the keel type . On the other hand , without a keel a longer tail is needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go into a series of downward loops . In this case , just quickly release the flying line and the kite will go back to flying upward . " The most exciting use for the parafoil design is for parachutes . Lift-todrag ratios of three to one and better have been demonstrated for specific designs . This is a rather steep glide compared to a regular rigid glider , but considerably better than normal parachutes . It means better control of landing sites for cargo drops and parachutists . A review of parafoil applications by Notre Dame , Air Force , and Navy researchers concluded that controlled cargo delivery at drop speeds of up to 130 knots could be accomplished with weights up to 2,000 pounds . All this points to some rather wild future demonstrations of load , altitude , and strong-wind capabilities . P. R. Lawson , of the department of mechanical engineering at the University of Waterloo in Ontario , told me of his research with Jalbert kites . He used gasoline-engine winches to tether and control the kites up to heights of 3,000 feet . Instruments carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressure , and relative-humidity changes at varying heights . The meteorological data was then used in conjunction with smoke-plume observations at a major thermal generating station for an air-pollution research program being carried out at the University of Waterloo . The kite size was seven-by-six feet and lifted instrument packages in ground winds of from five to 45 mph . Once , during a 45-mph wind , the @# @# winch failed . It took eight men Several hours to pull the kite down i , 1 hand . These kites have been flown both over land and from ships on Lake Huron using a 400-pound-test nylon braided line . Lawson feels the advantages at the Jalbert design are that it has no rigid parts , is easily transported , and is safe in event of a crash . It is also extremely powerful for its size Its disadvantage is a tendency to dive under gusty-wind conditions . Most of Jalbert 's designs have been for special scientific uses and cost 1 several hundred dollars . But his recently marketed miniature model , the Kytfoil ? about 27 inches by 36 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or $10.95 with snaps , drogue. and 500 feet of 36-pound test nylon and instructions . Order from Jalbert Aerology Laboratory , 170 NW 20th St. , Boca Raton , Fla. 33432 . Inflatables . Finally , there is a funny new kite I found as a breakfast-food premium . It is called the Puffer and is one of the few inflatable designaround . It 's distributed by Creative Marketing of Chicago , Ill . Made of thin plastic , the Puffer is blown up to an elongated pear shape , 42 inches long , 30 wide , and 12 thick . The grow met for attaching the string is already in place . It is light and goes up al most as though it had helium inside It is truly an advanced design . The kinds of fun you can have with kites seem endless . Altitude records are constantly being challenged . The most recent one was set by 10 Gary . Ind. , high-school students , who put up 19 Gayla deltas ( Gayla Kites , P.O Box 10800 , Houston , Tex . 77018 ) in June @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ challenging area : An unofficial record of 37 hours . 17 minutes was set at Sarasota , Fla . in Jan. 1971 . And Roger William .. ( R.I. ) College students kept a kite up 351/2 hours last April in a conte-t sponsored by Bermuda . With new scientific uses for kites cropping up , is there a major upswing of interest in the sport of kiting ' Definitely . Last year , according to one authoritative estimate , more than 35 million kites were sold , and countless more were home-built . If you want to learn more about kiting developments , one of the best ways is by joining the American Kite fliers Association , P.O. Box 1511 , Silver City , New Mex. 88061 . Membership is $3 and includes a bulletin called Kite Tails , which keeps members updated on new kites , kiters , and kiting methods . Have fun !
