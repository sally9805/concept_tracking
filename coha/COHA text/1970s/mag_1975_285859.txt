Among sci-fi 's most tired conventions is the one in which some latter-day cataclysm releases from an aeons-long sleep a monstrous prehistoric creature who rampages around for eight or nine reels until the combined brains of the **30;4632;TOOLONG complex figure out a novel ploy to dispatch the thing . <P> Such strained fictions have always seemed a lot of fuss to ichthyologists . Why bother to wake the creatures of unimaginably distant geologic ages when you can find , in a condition essentially unchanged for 63 million years , a creature cruising handily off every beach in the world who once shared the planet with dinosaurs , ichthyosaurs and pterosaurs and is as strange , unpredictable and dangerous as those bad old boys ? <P> That creature is , of course , the shark . Doubtless one of the reasons it has long exercised such a powerful hold on the imagination of everyone ( except , until recently , novelists and movie makers ) is that it attacks not merely out of the depths of the ocean but out of the depth of prehistory as well . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ despite ever-growing attention by marine scientists , there is precious little reliable information about sharks . It is not even known how many varieties of sharks there are ( best estimate : around 300 ) or how many of them must be regarded as definitely lethal to man ( best guess : about a dozen , with the great white and the tiger leading most lists ) . It is almost impossible to make wide-ranging behavioral generalizations from the way the creatures act in captivity and even more difficult to study them in their natural habitat . Science therefore knows more about the natural history and physiology of sharks , which can be gathered from autopsies , than about how they actually live in the wild . <P> Ranging in size from six inches to 60 feet , all shark species lack skeletons . Essentially they are masses of cartilage covered by a remarkably tough hide ( in itself a nasty rasplike weapon in the larger species ) . Theirs is an indiscriminating appetite . Everything from a keg of nails to a 100-lb. sea lion has been found in shark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's marine scientists theorize . Sharks are condemned by nature to a life without sleep or even rest . The reason is that they lack the swim bladders of the bony fishes , which permit the latter to float when they need to . A shark must literally swim or sink . If you wanted to anthropomorphize the beast , you could account for its wretched disposition by that fact alone .
