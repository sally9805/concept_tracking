A giant museum camera captures masterpieces <P> Engineers have spared no effort in recent years trying to reduce the size of everything from computers to portable radios . But Edwin Land , developer of the Polaroid instant camera , has taken a giant step in the opposite direction . At an exhibit at Boston 's Museum of Fine Arts this week , Land will show off one of the world 's largest cameras , a room-sized blowup of his old invention that in only a minute can make a full-color , full-sized copy of a masterpiece . <P> Land 's idea is not new . The camera obscura ( the word camera means room or chamber in Latin ) was described by the Islamic scientist Alhazen , who died in A.D. 1039 . It consisted of a darkened room with a small opening through which light passed to form an image on the wall opposite the aperture . Nor is using photography to make precise copies of paintings or other objets d'art a recent invention . Art reproductions have long been made by photographing paintings and then enlarging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . His large-scale camera produces a huge negative , 102 centimeters by 203 centimeters ( 40 in. by 80 in. ) , from which an equally big print is made by the Polaroid process . Unlike other large prints that are blown up from a small negative in conventional fashion and lose sharpness in the process , the Polaroid pictures show no graininess . Also , because the image on the original negative is so huge to begin with , conventional enlargement of sections of the negative can produce microscope-like magnifications . <P> Land first used his huge camera back in 1976 to make and then display for his stockholders a reproduction of his favorite Renoir . The Museum of Fine Arts has used the giant camera more recently to shoot the usually hidden side of a prized possession , a 15th century European tapestry titled The Martyrdom of St. Paul . Despite the best efforts of experts to preserve the side visible to the public , it has gradually deteriorated and faded . But when the museum recently replaced the tapestry 's linen backing ( a once-in-50-years undertaking ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the hanging-which had retained much of the vividness of the work 's original colors . In the spectacular picture that resulted , every thread is distinct , the colors are brilliant and the tapestry looks three-dimensional . <P> The device that made this remarkable picture possible is more than a king-size copy of the familiar Polaroid camera . Occupying an otherwise empty room at the museum , the camera is in effect a room within a room , a light-tight box 3.6 meters ( 12 ft. ) wide , 3.6 meters high and 4.8 meters ( 16 ft. ) deep . In addition to a large conventional lens , it contains a Rube Goldbergian arrangement of pulleys , ropes and rollers . While conventional Polaroid cameras are operated from the outside , the three technicians who work Land 's invention position themselves inside it .
