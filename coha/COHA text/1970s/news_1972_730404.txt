txt The audience is quiet but expectant as the judge , a competent-looking home economist , makes her way down a long table lined with paper plates full of cookies . She takes a cookie from each plate , turns it over to see if it is nicely browned on the bottom , and then breaks it in half , tasting a small piece from the middle . She takes occasional sips of coffee to clear her taste buds . Finally she moves back toward the center of the table and stops to unfold a small tag attached to a plate of peanut-butter cookies . She reads it to herself and then makes the awaited announcement ; " The winner of the cookie sweepstakes Is  --  Mrs. Mildred Phillips of Centerville . " There are a few pained looks around the room , but the applause is prompt and warm . Mrs. Phillips , a grandmotherly farm wife wearing a flowered print dress , accepts congratulations from her husband , daughter , sonin-law and other well-wishers . She is n't too surprised she won  --  she has taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't expect her peanut-butter cookies to get the top prize . " I was partial to my butterscotch cookies , but I guess the judge knows best , " she says . It 's no accident if this sounds like something out of the movie " State Fair , " that good old musical of the 19400 whose setting was the Iowa State Fair . This is the Iowa State Fair , 1972 version , now in its annual 10-day run here . Some of the Old Flavor The fair , like Iowa itself , is n't nearly as bucolic as it was 30 years ago . Farmers nowadays make the scene in air-conditioned Pontiaca and Winnebago campers and cheerfully plunk down $5 a ticket to see their TV favorites perform in the fairground 's main grandstand . Still , the event has managed to retain more of its old-time flavor than moat . The concession stands here continue to sell lemonade made from real lemons , for instance . The asphalt pavement on the midway still is thoroughly melted by noon on steamy , 90-degree-plue days . The smells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the routines of the thrill-show barkers . " If your heart can stand it , come and see Big Bertha the boa , " says the man outside the " Swamp Creatures " show . " She 's so big , so long , so strong she can crush a bull . " Even some of the faces are the same . Over at the campground , where some 9,000 fairgoers dig in for the whole 10 days , Walter and Florence Bauer , a retired farm couple from West Chester , sit on aluminum folding chairs in front of their trailer . He 's 68 and she 's 66 , and it 's the 40th straight year they 've vacationed here . " I guess you'might say it 's a habit with us , " says the gray-haired Mr. Bauer . " It 's about the only place we can get to easily where there 's enough to keep us busy for more than a day or two . " There 's plenty to do , all right , and plenty of people come to do IL The record for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Last year 's attendance was 645,193 . Officials say that this year as many as 680,000 could pay their way in here by Sunday , the last day of the fair . It Started in Syracuse The situation is much the same all over the country . The state fair , dedicated to the advancement of agriculture and the home arts , is one of America 's most venerable institutions , dating from the 1841 New York fair in Syracuse . It 's also one of the most enduringly popular , even though the flight from farms and small towns continues . The International Association of Fairs and Expositions in Chicago , which keeps track of such things , estimates that 25 million people will visit the nation 's 46 state fairs this year . That figure has been rising by a percent or two annually for the past decade , despite stiffer competition from all sorts of other diversions . One big reason that people still come to the fairs , of course , is that they have become less the agricultural expositions they once were and serve increasingly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . That 's true here , too , and Iowans this fortnight are being offered  --  for one night each at $5 , $4 , $3 and ** and Cher , Bob Hope , Bill Cosby , Paul Anka and various rock ' n ' roll , gospel , and country and Western singing luminaries , along with the traditional midway shows , livestock judging ' and farm-equipment displays . In addition , there were horse races last Friday and daily presentations of that rural entertainment staple , the stock-car race . ( Last Sunday a woman at a shooting gallery was killed when she was struck by a car that bounced off a railing , hit another car , careened over two protective fences and crashed into the midway area . ) Gasoline fumes from the afternoon 's auto racing hang over the big grandstand until the TV stars and singers are well into their evening shows . Compromises Beached Iowa has diversified its fair entertainment with less alacrity than some states , and the fair program frequently has been a focus of contention over how Iowans should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compromise . Thus , there is horse racing here but no pari-mutuel betting , and while there are rock shows for the youngsters , they tend to be on the tame side . At least this week 's featured group , The Guess Who , poses for publicity photos in jackets and ties . The struggle to keep the fair wholesome was more spirited than usual this year , and , after a long and involved series of legal maneuvers , it resulted in the near elimination from the midway of such traditional carnival games as ring tom , throwing darts at balloons and knocking over bottles with baseballs . The Names , it was arirued , constituted gambling and thus violated the state 's 121-year-old antilottery law . " I hated like heck to do it , but I had no choice , " says Richard Turner , Iowa 's attorney general , who directed the courtroom drive against the games . " Last fall we closed down a small-town church carnival because they had some heavy gambling going on , but people Bald we had no business doing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Pretty soon , some of the newspapers were saying the same thing . " Well , we looked up the statute , and , sure enough , any game where a consideration is paid in an attempt to win a prize is gambling . I had to do my duty , even though it 'll probably get me beat at the polls . " A few games are operating on the midway , but instead of prizes for winning , everyone who plays get a coupon , which can be cashed later for a prize ( 20 coupons buy a teddy bear ) . Not surprisingly , there are few takers . " It 's killed our concessions business , " complains Al Kunz , head of Century 21 Shows , which runs the carnival part of the fair . " I do n't see how we can afford to come back next year unless they get things straightened out " Good-Natured Crowds Chances are that the games will be back in 1973 ; a referendum to change the gambling laws is on the state ballot this fall and is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ games has n't had a noticeable effect on attendance . Business at the 50 or so midway rides , including seven tennis wheels , is especially brisk . Sonny and Cher drew capacity crowds of almost 20,000 to each of their two openingnight shows . Other attractions , such as Victor the bear , a large , amiable and heavily insured animal who wrestles all corners , also are doing well . Victor had a few bad days because of the heat and was wrestling only his trainer instead of taking on all corners , but he was soon back in action . The crowds are good-natured . This is par for the course here , observers say . " You 'll never see a nicer bunch of people , " says Wendell Nichols , Des Moines police chief . " We get a few complaints about pickpockets every year , and a young group from town sometimes gets to being unruly on the midway , but it 's never serious . Our biggest problem at fair time is people getting lost around town . A lot of them are farmers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get to driving around in circles . " City folks make up the bulk of the fair crowd , and the big-name acts get most of the attention and the money ( Sonny and Cher were guaranteed $30,000 against a percentage of the gate for their one-night stand ; Bob Hope got $25,000 for his ) , but it 's the farmers who give the event its special quality . Members of farm families make up most of the 13,500 persons who have entered fair competitions this year in everything from Angus cattle raising to insect collections . Indeed , a primary purpose of the grandstand shows is to earn money to award cash prizes to the winners of fair contests ; some $235,000 is dispensed in such premiums annually while only about $65,000 is collected from entry fees . No single winner gets much in the way of prize money because the total is divided among 4,800 classes of competition . The top award in most classifications is just $3 or $5 and a blue ribbon . Nonetheless , " we think a little cash makes it more interesting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that many fair participants put into their entries can hardly be justified by the prizes they win . Take the 60-year-old Mrs. Phillips , the cookie-sweepstakes winner . For the past 25 years she has brought upwards of 100 samples of her culinary work here annually . They inculde jams , jellies , butters , pickles and preserves as well as based goods . She starts getting ready for the next fair as soon as the present one ends . " The baked things keep real well if you wrap them tight in tinfoil and freeze them , " she says . Tired of Dusting Mrs. Phillips has won so many trophies and ribbons that she does n't know what to do with them . " Mostly , they 're in boxes in the attic , " she says . " I used to hang them , but I got tired of dusting them . " She continues : " I guess I got used to doing a lot of cooking when my three children were growing up , and I ca n't quit even though they are married and moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hunting with hound dogs . " The women of Anita , a town of 1,200 in the western part of the state , give much the same explanation for why they win the ladies ' horseshoe-pitching contest every year at the fair . " A bunch of us started pitching several years ago cause our men seemed to enjoy it so much , " says Mrs. Ruth Bailey , a carpenter 's wife from Anita , who won the title in 1968 and was runner-up the last three years . " First we just went on Monday nights , over at the bandshell park , but pretty soon we were doing it Thursdays and weekends , too . Some of us got pretty good at it . " Mrs. Bailey , a grandmother , is favored to win her second fair championship here . Mary Ann Kaiser , an Anita teen-ager , won the tournament In 1969 , 1970 and 1971 , but " she 's getting married this year and does n't seem to care much about pitching , " Mrs. Bailey says . Vocational Training For the young members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make up about one-third of the fair 's participants , the competition is partly for fun but mostly for vocational training . Over at the cattle barn on Blue Ribbon Road , 16-year-old Danny Creighton , from Hampton , is spiffing up Tom , his 1,100-pound Angus steer , for the afternoon 's cattle judging . He 's putting black shoe polish on the animal 's hooves so they will match the rest of him and Is applying hair spray to his legs so the hair will stand up just right . Danny , a short , stocky youth who wears his hair and sideburns longish , has raised Tom from a calf and admits being attached to him , but he says he is n't overly disturbed that the animal will be sold for slaughter shortly after the judging . " I 'm going to be a farmer when I finish school , and a farmer ca n't get too friendly with his livestock , " he explains . Besides , he says , the $375 to $400 that Tom will fetch as beef will help pay off a used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which matches the best of Iowa 's livestock , is even more businesslike . Most of the entrants are professional breeders for whom shows such as the state fair are a crucial part of their selling effort . They typically enter their stock in contests throughout the Midwest , and the more prises they win the higher the price they can command for their animals . " Entering shows is the way I advertise , " says Dale Westre , a 44-year-old hog breeder from Lehigh , who has 28 of his Hampahirea and Yorkshires competing in various prise classifications here . He and his panther , who is also his son-In-law . travel the Midwestern fair circuit in a large trailer truck , bedding down for the night on cots they carry with them They pick up between $1,200 and $1,800 a year ' in prize money , but this just revere expo/wee . " A lot of the people who come to see the judgings have it in their minds to do some buying , " Mr. Metre says . " If they like what I 'm showing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . That 's when the real payoff comes , " Judging Has Changed The standards of livestock judging also have changed to reflect the requirements of the marketplace . " In years past , livestock shows were really beauty contests , and the fattest , shiniest animals would win . Now we pay a lot more attention to economic factors , " says Wayne Haygood , a 34-year-old cattle expert , who manages a large cattle-breeding farm at New Harmony , Ind. , and is the Hereford judge at the fair here . " We look mainly for things like rate of growth , length and the soundness of an animal We walk them more than we used to because we want to see how well they 'll travel . We look for good muscling now instead of a lot of fat , You 'll never see a flabby animal win a big prize . We 've become very scientific . " Other things also are changing around the fair , and it 's likely that keeping the event the way it used to be will get harder as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Judge at the fiddling contest bemoans the lack of new blood . " Some of our beat fiddlers are passing on , and the kids are n't interested , " he says . " All they want to do is play the electric guitar . " An almost certain casualty is the girlie shows that used to give fairgoers a rare public glimpse of female flesh . Two of them are on the midway this year  --  both routine burlesque affairs to phonograph music  --  and the crowds are sparse and getting sparser . " We 're losing money on them all over . I think we 'll pack them In after this season , " says Century 21 's Mr. Kunz in his trailer office on the fairgrounds . " Today , you have X-rated movies and hot pants , so who needs girlie shows ? You can see almost as much out on the midway as you can inside the tents . "
