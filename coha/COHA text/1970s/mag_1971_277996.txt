The Fifth Dynasty , a period of the Old Kingdom that lasted from about 2450 to 2290 B.C. , is a puzzling blank in Egyptology . Little of its art has survived ; its pyramids were jerry-built and unprepossessing ; the surviving clues to its history are so meager that few of its pharaohs can even be identified . One who can be was King Ny-user-ra , who ruled from about 2370 to 2360 B.C. Few statues of Ny-user-ra were known ; one of them was in the Cairo Museum . It gave no hint of his appearance , since head and torso were missing , but it was certainly he , because his name was carved on the granite base beneath the striding legs . But where was the King 's top half ? Recently , the Brooklyn Museum 's curator of ancient art , Dr. Bernard V. Bothmer , announced triumphantly that he had found it 5,844 miles from Cairo , displayed in the Memorial Art Gallery in Rochester . <P> Putting this third-millennium Humpty Dumpty together again was an impressive feat of memory and scholarship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the National Museum of Lebanon in Beirut that he was able to identify as an effigy of Ny-user-ra . Checking archives for other monuments of the obscure King , he turned up a reference to the lower half of the broken Cairo statue , which had its left arm hanging by its side but no trace of a right arm . The Rochester bust , he remembered , was close in style to the statue of Ny-user-ra in Beirut , and it had its right arm raised gripping a mace . <P> " At that point , " says Bothmer , " it clicked . If the broken statue of Ny-user-ra in Cairo had no arm on its right hip , the arm must have been raised . That described the Rochester fragment . " At Bothmer 's request , Cairo made a plaster cast of its piece and shipped it to New York . When Bothmer placed the Rochester bust on Ny-user-ra 's legs , it fitted exactly . The completed statue is now on display at the Brooklyn Museum - and the Pharaoh looks a lot more pharaonic in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
