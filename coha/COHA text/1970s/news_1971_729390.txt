txt At the $125-a-plate testimonial dinner given for him March 22 , Joseph Colombo S.-. posed for a traditional family portrait ? the benign patriarch surrounded by his wife , four sons , two daughters-in-law and a 5-year-old daughter . A portrait of Colombo 's other " family , " according to law - enforcement officials , would show Colombo in the same central position , but the supporting cast would be different . At his right , the law enforcers say , would be the underboss of Colombo 's Mafia family , and on each side of them five capos ( captains ) . Behind this first line of leadership would stand about 200 family members and associates . Federal . stale and local agents who , f , ollow the activi:ie. ; of this group say that it represents a new generation in the Mafia . " The Colombo group has a style and character ail its own , " said an assistant district attorney in Brooklyn . " Most of its members are American-born , free-wheeling men not so bound to tradition and eager to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Federal agent . " Like Colombo , the family 's capos ore well-spoken , polished and inn ova Live . " Unlike some older family bosses , Colombo has concentrated on getting his men involved in legitimate business . " It is almost a fetish with him , " said the Federal agent . " We believe Colombo ? himself has interests through fronts in about 20 businesses in New York . " Colombo urges members of his family to hold some kind of legitimate job to help jusi i fy their expenditures , la w enforcement officials said . Colombo has worked as a salesman for Cantalupo Realty Company , 1434 86th Street , // Bensonhurst , Brooklyn . Law enforecment officials divide the history of the Mafia in the United States into three periods . Until 1931 , it was led by gangsters born and raised in southern Italy . Then a group led by Charles ( Lucky ) Luciano took over and these men were more attuned to the new country . But they feared public exposure and remained mindful of Mafia traditions . The Colombo family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that of Luciano 's era , law enforcement officials believe . Colombo refused to grant an interview to discuss the contention of law enforcement officials that he heads such a group , but he has publicly denied leadership of any organized crime element . Law enforcement officials , citing information gathered from monitored conversations and from underworld informants , said that they had a clear picture of the structure and membership of the Colombo family . Youth Takes Over Unlike the other Mafia families in New York , the law enf orcement officials said , the Colombo group is made up of young men . Colombo , 48 years old , is the youngest Mafia leader in the country , they maintain , and most of his capos are in their 30 's or early 40 's . The big exception is Salvatore Mineo , - the underboss , who is 73 . But he is believed to be rather inactive , given the title by Colombo to keep the job from going to one of the ambitious capos , some of whom harbor grudges against their leader . When Colombo took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old guard then in power and replaced them with younger men pressing for position . The story of how Colombo came to power is frequently discussed , not only among law officials , but also inside the Mafia . Colombo 's rise , for example , was a topic in the taped conversations of reputed New Jersey Mafia leader , Simone Rizzo DeCavalcante , that were released by the Federal Bureau of Investigation on a Federal court order in 1969 . Colombo 's break , these conversations indicate , came in 1962 when Joseph Bonanno , leader of a New York family and a member of the Mafia national commission , decided to try to become the dominant force in the Mafia . Assassin Pulls Switch Bonanno 's reported plan called for the killing of three Mafia leaders , Carlo Gambino and Thomas Luchese , both of New York , and Stephano Magaddino of Buffalo . He gave the contracts for the assassinations to a colleague , Giuseppe Magliocco , who in turn farmed them out to Colombo , a newly appointed capo in the Magliocco family . Instead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planned coup . Bonanno ultimately was forced to surrender leadership of his family . Magliocco repented of his part in the scheme , was fined by the commission and died shortly afterward . The leadership of Magliocco 's family and his seat in the commission went to Joseph Colombo , apparently as a reward for exposing Bonanno 's plans . The DeCavalcante tapes indicate that Colombo 's booster was Carlo Gambino , who , Federal agents say , is one of the most powerful Mafia bosses in the country . Until his elevation , Colombo was considered a lightweight by his colleagues , the DeCavalcante tapes make clear . Police officials say Colombo spent most of his time playing up to powerful Mafiosi like Gambino . " He was the Mafia 's Sammy Glick , " said one officer . A similar assessment was expressed by DeCavalcante and his underboss , Frank Majuri , in one of the taped conversations released In 1989 . Here is part of the exchange : DeCavalcante : This guy Colombo sits like a baby next to Carl Gambino all the time . He 'd do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : I told you , Sam , I was surprised when I heard he was in there head of the Brooklyn family . I would never have made that guess . DeCavalcante : What experience has he got ? lira was a bustout guy petty gambler all his life . ' Majuri : How can they make a guy like Joe Colombo sit at the commission ? Colombo inherited his association in the family he ultimately took over from his father , Anthony Colombo , who was garroted in 1938 and found , dead in his car next to the body of a woman friend , Christine Oliveri , who had also been strangled . The crime was never solved . The Mafia family Joseph Colombo came to rule , according to lawmen , differs in several aspects from other families in New York . Its approximate 200 members and associates make it small in size compared , say , to the Carlo Gambino family , which is believed to be four times as big . The Colombo family rackets are almost exclusively in Brook ? lyn and Long Island , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spread out all the way from New Haven to the outskirts of Philadelphia . Law enforcement officials say that the rackets of the Colombo family  --  about 20 of whose members are under current indictment  --  include numbers and sports gambling , hijacking , fencing in stolen goods and loan-sharking  --  the lending of money at usurious interest . $3-Million in Loans " Our informants tell us that Colombo 's family has at least $3-million in the street , " one Federal agent said . He explained that the money has been lent to individuals who could not get credit through legitimate channels at interest ranging from 20 per cent to 250 per cent . Before going to work for Cantalupo Realty , Colombo was employed for six years as a salesman for Pride Wholesale Meat Company , which was controlled by Peter Castellano and Paul Gambino , brother of Carlo Gambino . Castellano was identified by the Senate Permanent Subcommittee of Investigations in 1965 as a captain in the Gambino family . For 10 years before joining the meat company , Colombo worked intermittently as a longshoreman , according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before that , he spent three years in the Coast Guard . During his service period , he went absent without leave three times , according to his military record . For his last offense , he was sentenced to a year 's confinement , but he received a discharge before completing the sentence because he suffered from " psychoneurosis . " A medical report in his record says he was " unable to adapt to the restrictions of military life because of tension and instability . . . " For two years after his discharge in 1945 , he received a disability allowance of $11.50 a month as a result of his nervous disorder . Unemployed , but Loyal Colombo became a salesman for Cantalupo Realty nine years ago . Anthony A. Cantalupo , president of the company , told the New York State Legislative Committee on Crime last year when it questioned him about his famous salesman that he considered Colombo " a perfect gentleman . " He added that Colombo had " the sincerest group of clients  --  they do n't cheat him out of his commissions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to law enforcement agents , follow Colombo 's example in having legitimate jobs , with one notable exception . He is Nick Bianco , who the agents say left the Mafia family of Raymond Patriarca in New England to join the Colombo group . Bianco has not had a steady job for years , they say , but Colombo Indulges him because he values his loyalty . Colombo puts a high premiwn on loyalty . Although otherwise an astute leader , according to law enforcement officials , he picks his closest associates not for their intelligence or imagination but for their loyalty to him . " As a result , " said one agent , " most of the men nearest him are third-raters . " The official said that Colombo takes such care to surround himself with absolutely loyal men because he fears hostile factions within his own family . The hostility goes back to the early nineteen-sixties when the family , not yet under Colombo 's rule , was torn by an internal conflict known as the Profaci-Gallo war . The family was then led by Joseph Profaci , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own airport in Hightstown , N. J. In 1961 , a dissident group in the family , led by Larry , Albert and Joseph Gallo , began kidnaping Profaci lieutenants in a dispute with Profaci over illegal profits . Profaci died of cancer in 1962 , but the war continued under his successor , Giuseppe Magliocco . The conflict finally faded when a close and powerful ally of the Gallos , Tony Bender , suddenly disappeared . Later Joe Gallo was sent to prison for extortion and Larry Gallo died of cancer . But Joseph Gallo , who is called Crazy Joe , was released last month and , informants have told the police , Colombo is more than a little uneasy at having him back in circulation , although Gallo is on parole for four years and must be cautious . The man in his family Colombo is said to fear most , however , is Carmine Persico , 37 , the tough leader of a powerful faction within the family . Persico , however , is afraid to move against Colombo as long as Colombo has Gambino 's support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempt to purge Persico because it may touch off another round of internal warfare . ' Bad Blood ' Reported Police believe that there has been " bad blood " between Persico and Colombo for several reasons . Persico , according to the law officials , was a zealous follower of Profaci and felt that Colombo did not give strong support to the late boss in the war against the Gallos . He was furious when Colombo took a conciliatory position toward the Gallos after he became head of the family . Persico has always felt that Colombo did not deserve to be given the leadership of the family over more experienced capos , informants have reported , and he has expressed the belief that Colombo has not treated his faction fairly , giving it the most dangerous and least profitable assignments . The Persico faction is heavily involved in hijacking and loansharking , according to the police . Persico was sentenced to 14 years in prison for hijacking in 1969 and is free on bail pending appeal of his case . While few others in the Colombo family feel the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ informants have told law enforcement officials that Colombo 's unorthodox tactics have caused considerable grumbling among many family members . They complain that Colom-1 bo 's well-publicized attacks on the F.B.I . and other law en-1 forcement agencies have . made all family members targets of lawmen . " You do Joe a favor these days and you wind up in trouble , " said one member of the family to a law enforcement official recently . F.B.I . agents deny focusing special attention on any particular group of criminals , but they acknowledge greater success on organized crime cases in general . " When you have to walk through a picket line to get to the office , you tend to work a lot harder , " said one agent . Grumbling about Colombo has been heard also in other Mafia families . The chief criticism , according to informants , is that Colombo has had the Italian-American Civil Rights League , which he founded , stage demonstrations whenever he has been arrested , but he has shown little interest when other Mafia figures faced the same problem . Testimony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last year after his son , Joseph Jr. , was arrested by the F.B.I . on charges of conspiracy to melt silver coins into more valuable ingots . The son was acquitted last month after a key Government witness suddenly recanted his testimony . Colombo and his wife , Lucille , live with their two unmarried sons and daughter in a split-level house at 1161 83d Street , Brooklyn , about a half mile from the Cantalupo Realty Company . He also own an estate at Blooming Grove , N. Y. , near Goshen in Orange County . The estate , which has tennis courts , a handball court and a swimming pool , was assessed five years ago at $86,200 . The Internal Revenue Service has contended that Colombo could not maintain these properties and his comfortable life style on his income as a real estate salesman , which was reported as ranging front $18,000 to $35,000 in the last eight years . Colombo is under Federal indictment that accuses him of evading $19,169 in Federal income taxes from 1963 to 1967 . He is free on bail pending appeal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ application for a real estate broker 's license . He was sentenced to one to two years and a half years in prison for lying about his criminal record , which includes 13 arrests and three convictions ? two fines for gambling and a 30-day contempt sentence in 1966 . Colombo has also been implicated in a $75,000 jewel robbery in Nassau County and is under indictment on a charge of contempt of court in Brooklyn . Confrontation Still Due Colombo 's most dramatic confrontation with the law , however , promises to come out of a Federal indictment accusing him and 30 others of interstate gambling violations . The complaint , charges that Colombo directed a gambling operation with a weekly gross of $50,000 to $100,000 . Evidence in the case , the complaint says , includes legally monitored conversations at the home of Phyliss Schettini , who is described in the complaint as a " close friend " of Colombo . Colombo 's future in the Mafia , law enforcement agents believe , depends on two factors ? how he survives the legal battles now facing him and how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , stays alive . If Colombo 's legal prohlems result only in minor jail terms and if Gambino is arotwd for several years to back him ; . said the law officials , Colombn will emerge as one of the most formidable Mafia leaders in ? the country . But , the law officials added , if Colombo has to spend , -a long time in prison or if Gambino , who reportedly suffers from a chronic cardiac condition , dies soon , Colombo may find ' the leadership of his own - family slipping from his grasp .
