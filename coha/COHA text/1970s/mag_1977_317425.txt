The Presidency/Hugh Sidey <P> The yahoo syndrome has been detected in the White House . <P> God ( or perhaps Senator Russell Long ) help us if President Jimmy Carter succumbs . So far only Jody Powell , Hamilton Jordan and assorted other Georgians appear to be weakening , and they only mildly . There is hope before permanent disability sets in . <P> <P> The yahoo syndrome is a mutation of an earlier condition . In Lyndon Johnson 's time it was called " cornponeitis , " and with Richard Nixon it came out as the " better people " prejudice . Both terms came from the Presidents ' describing how they felt others unfairly viewed them . <P> The problem can be defined thusly : as long as Presidents are successful , they are proud ( indeed , some might say , even overbearing ) about their geographical , cultural and intellectual identities . But when success begins to elude them , they detect in the world beyond the White House walls ( particularly in New York and Washington ) massive arrogance and contempt aimed at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chips on their shoulders , which weight them into self-pity . The doubt and anger that result in such cases may well have damaged this nation far more than presidential overconfidence . <P> Some warning tremors of this sort are coming now from White House underlings who complain that Carter 's words are being unfairly edited , that Henry Kissinger ( a prime Carter campaign punching bag ) is being excessively venerated , that the Georgia boys are being called a bunch of yahoos . Something described vaguely as the Washington Establishment is blamed for frustrating the President 's plans by spreading its thin-blooded cynicism through the candlelit parlors of Georgetown . Of course , there is some truth in such criticisms . But there are also a few facts to be considered . <P> No scientific survey has been made , but it is a good guess that at least 86.3% of the people in Washington could start thinking of themselves as yahoos if they were to begin feeling paranoid . ( For New York the figure is slightly less , perhaps 67.4% . ) There remain in the capital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prominence by running brothels and selling swampland at exorbitant prices to homeless debtors just off the boats . But most of the Washington Establishment is only a few years removed from Dubuque lawyers and St. Joe hucksters , largely people of humble origins and quaint folkways . <P> Almost always , the first important complaints about the injustices borne by outlanders-or poor country folk , or the unentrenched-come from those who are having problems . Neither geography nor origins have much to do with it . Lyndon Johnson was a hero in Washington for decades , but when Viet Nam became an overwhelming problem for him , he began protesting that he was being picked on because he was not a Harvard graduate , liked the Presidential Seal on his cowboy boots and when he said hors d'oeuvres it came out " oar doves . " In Nixon 's dark days , he told and retold the tale of his family 's hardscrabble origins and stories of slights from Dwight Eisenhower and the Kennedy clan .                @ @ @ @ @
