txt President Ford faces strong opposition among Democrats in Congress to any request for urgent military help for Vietnam . Republicans will also need considerable persuading . . These conclusions emerge from interviews with key figures on Capitol Hill . Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield strongly opposes the expected effort to provide $300 million in military aid quickly to beleaguered South Vietnam . What is more , in a telephone interview he indicated doubt that Congress as a whole would agree either : " It would be quite a fight , " he said . " I 'm not certain the Ford administration could get it . " Two differing views Members of Congress , he said , have had their fill of Southeast Asia . They think these people ought to settle their problems in their own way , at their own time . " On the other hand , Sen. Jacob K. Javits , second most senior Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , thinks Congress probably will agree to the additional $300 million . This is largely because two years ago , when U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a major commitment to aid it for three years . This is the beginning of the third year . But congressional approval will come , he indicates , only if Congress is satisfied that the South Vietnamese Government has a good chance to // * Congress cool to Thieu aid // survive if it receives aid , and that the ' Thieu government has taken steps toward increased democracy . No confirmation Thus far the Ford administration : has refused to confirm widespread : reports that it is seeking an additional . $300 million in military aid . At Thurs-t day 's White House briefing , presiden- : tial press secretary Ron ? Nessen did : say the President is giving " intensive . consideration " to additional aid for : South Vietnam . He added that the President believes current levels of U.S. military ! ? aid to both South Vietnam and Cambodia are inadequate . Long an opponent of past U.S. military action in Indo  --  China , Senator Mansfield refuses to say whether he would lead the Senate fight to oppose additional aid , saying only in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the expected proposal . Senator Mansfield rejects what is expected to be the Ford administration 's major argument when it makes the requests : that the U.S. has spent so much money in South Viet ; : nam it now should provide this corn , : paratively little more to enable the : South Vietnamese to repel North : Vietnam , now in sizable military . offensive . Too much already He says impatiently : " We 've all : ready paid too high a price . . . . We 'll be paying for this war to about the year 2045 , with a total cost of about $385 billion . " These estimated figures come from a 1972 report by the Department of Commerce and Census Bureau , he says . They include such long-range . costs as Veterans ' hospitals , retire-. ment benefits to Vietnam-ERA ser-. vicemen and women , and disability costs for wounded Vietnam veterans. , It is widely reported here that tli ? Ford administration decided to seek the additional $300 million on Tues. day , following the fall of South Vietna- : mese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ambassador Graham Martin that South Vietnam urgently needs more ammunition to prevent military catastrophe . But it is in the full Senate and full . House that the proposal will face its , stiffest tests , There is doubt theie whether in a time of serious domestic economic difficulties Congress will , agree to send additional money to South Vietnam . ?
