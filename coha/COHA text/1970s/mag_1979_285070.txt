Does the Nuclear Regulatory Commission regulate enough ? <P> The reactor accident on Three Mile Island brought into public glare a little-known federal agency with tremendous responsibilities : the Nuclear Regulatory Commission , which is charged with making sure that nuclear plants are safe before it licenses them , and then enforcing strict operating rules . President Carter 's inquiry into the reasons for the near disaster in Pennsylvania will inevitably examine the performance of the NRC . <P> Regulation of reactors began under the Atomic Energy Commission , set up in 1946 shortly after the first atomic bomb fell on Japan . The AEC had the job of both promoting and safeguarding the development of atomic power . In 1974 President Gerald Ford signed a bill splitting the AEC into two agencies with separate functions : the Energy Research and Development Administration , which encourages the growth of nuclear power , and the NRC , which is concerned with safety . <P> This history is behind the main charge leveled against the NRC by the Union of Concerned Scientists , which is composed of 70,000 members , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experts . The nonprofit organization charges that the NRC has been far too lax about safety standards for nuclear power . Says U.C.S. Spokesman Robert Pollard , a former NRC safety inspector who resigned when his recommendations were overridden : " The top men at the NRC grew up in the AEC with the dream of nuclear energy . For that dream to work , it has to be economical . Even though they are only supposed to be regulating for public safety , these people take the cost of regulation into consideration and make safety decisions on that basis . " <P> Pollard and his colleagues cite a series of safety hazards they claim the NRC has tolerated in nuclear plants around the nation , including Three Mile Island . For example , the scientists contend that defects in 26 reactors built by General Electric might cause the release of radiation in an accident similar to the one in Pennsylvania . The scientists have also produced a pamphlet , called the " Nugget File , " that describes mishaps at nuclear plants , like the use of a basketball to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The U.C.S. also claims that top staff members of the NRC are too cozy with the industry they are regulating . A 1975 study done by Common Cause found that 65% of NRC staffers had been employed by companies that held licenses , permits or contracts with the commission . In particular , the U.C.S. is critical of NRC Chairman Joseph M. Hendrie for not keeping at arm 's length the industry he regulates . Retorts Hendrie : " I do n't think my critics know my mindset . They have a po litical goal , which is to capture the NRC with antinuclear forces . " And Hendrie insists : " I 've never worked a day in my life for the commercial nuclear industry .
