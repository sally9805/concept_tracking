Its chief has little impact <P> When James Mclntyre Jr . was propelled from near anonymity last December to replace flamboyant Bert Lance as chief of the Office of Management and Budget , everybody hoped that more was there than met the eye . Mclntyre , 37 , had served well enough as Lance 's deputy at OMB and as Georgia 's budget director under Governor Jimmy Carter . But many skeptics wondered if the bland lawyer from Vidalia , Ga. , had the forcefulness and credentials for the top job previously held by such heavyweights as Charles Schultze and Kermit Gordon . Of his critics , Mclntyre asked only " that I be judged on my experience . " <P> Now that judgment is in-and to many at OMB and on Capitol Hill Mclntyre appears to be a man in over his head , a sheep in sheep 's clothing . To alarmists , he is an inept custodian of a budget out of control . <P> The OMB Director is the chief adviser to the President on the preparation and control of the budget , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spending plans of the Government 's myriad agencies . The job calls for making agonizing choices from among many competing programs while keeping a lid on spending . With inflation rising and demands on the public purse growing , the post is especially critical . Yet under Mclntyre , the OMB has less impact on policy than at any time in memory , even though the Director continues to enjoy the support of the President , who is comfortable with his fellow Georgian 's basic fiscal conservatism . <P> Part of the problem is Mclntyre 's deferential style , which makes it difficult for him to play the OMB Director 's traditional role of abominable no man . At the Thursday breakfast meetings of the economic council in Treasury Secretary Michael Blumenthal 's private dining room , Mclntyre adds little to the discussions . At staff meetings with the President , the OMB chief is the ultimate wallflower , letting assistants do most of the talking . <P> Mclntyre does not yet seem familiar enough with federal programs to act as either a strong advocate or an effective critic . Last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the leading experts on budget policy , condemned the fiscal 1979 budget for failing to make any decisions on spending priorities and putting forward " no significant new proposals for economizing . " When HEW Secretary Joseph Califano first proposed a welfare reform package last year , he claimed it would cost $2.8 billion more than existing welfare programs ; by January the extra price had leaped to $8.8 billion , and the Congressional Budget Of fice now estimates it at $17.4 billion . An alert and knowing OMB should have stopped such a boondoggle at the start . <P> As a manager , Mclntyre is almost universally regarded as a thoroughly nice guy , a smiling fellow who is unable to make decisions fast enough on problems he does not understand . The result , staffers complain , is that it takes forever to get things through his office . He also tends to bog down in minutiae , especially in the area of Government reorganization , while major policy questions are slighted . Mclntyre has made both his own and his staffs job even tougher by failing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deputy director and chief economist .
