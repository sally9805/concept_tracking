THE TALK OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment WE have received a letter from a friend , a young man who has told us that he thinks being funny is the most important thing in life , that he uses humor to hide from real human contact , and that he is never serious , even for one minute : Everybody has advice for President Carter these days , and I am no different . I know that the President has said he wants the Cabinet members to travel the country getting the views of ordinary citizens , and , while I think that that is a great idea , I am very busy , and I 'm afraid I just wo n't have time to sit around and chat with Secretary of Agriculture Robert Bergland ( or whoever it is they send to see me ) , and so I have made a simple list of my suggestions , which the Cabinet member can just pick up when he stops by the house . I think my advice is hardheaded and timely , and , if followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these days of spiralling costs and soaring inflation in a land still traumatized by the agonies of Vietnam and Watergate . My advice is as follows : 1 . Avoid jackrabbit starts . 2 . Wait at least a half hour after eating before going back into the water . 3 . Brush up and down , not across . 4 . Remove necktie before operating lathe . 5 . Mail early in the day . 6 . Do n't slouch. 7 . Make sure that seat backs and tray tables are in their full upright position for landing . 8 . Never draw to an inside straight . 9 . Get set for metric . 10 . Take all you want , but eat all you take . 11 , Do n't run near the pool . 12 . When reading , practice SQ3R ( Study , Question , Read , Review , Reread ) . 13 . Check tire pressure often . 14 . Call if you 're going to be late . ? ? Inauguration OUR Inaugural correspondent , apple-cheeked and frostbitten after attending the recent ceremonies in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dispatch : Clear , clean , shining white ice everywhere , and bright-blue sky above . The weather set the tone : one had to bundle up , keep warm , press forward . I arrived in Washington a few days before the actual inauguration , and pressed forward . Bleachers for the Inaugural Parade were still being put together near the Treasury Building and the White House . Lafayette Square , across from the ' White House , was a tangled trailer camp of immense television-cable vans . Finishing touches were being put on the reviewing stand where the new President would sit and watch the parade . A Flag flew from the top of the White House : the outgoing President was still in residence . The white of the White House glowed . The White House lawns were snow white , Capitol Hill was snow white . The city was crowding up  --  endless buses , hawkers , balloons , Carter buttons , Ford buttons , tiny gold-plated peanut pins ( brisk demand ) . A distinct air of courtesy , expectancy , general good manners . Literally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went off to see " Treasures of Tutankharnun " at the National Gallery , and fell in with a delegation of the wives of mayors ( reflected local power ) and a pride of schoolchildren . Old King Tut ( he was really young , and died early ) exercised temporal power briefly thirty-three hundred years ago , and crowds gathered around the cabinet containing the gold-andblue striped crook and the flail that he carried on certain state occasions . Symbols of mighty power , now in a Plexiglas case . A teacher said to her charges , " Have you thought about how oId some of these things are , and how delicatd , " and the class nodded , in a bewildered way . I did a good deal of skipping around . I skipped down behind the White House to the frozen Ellipse , where the Tempel Lipizzan Stallions were to make a wintry appearance . A gallant , frozen band of people awaited the horses , but a genuinely saddened man announced that the horses had unanimously nixed the scheme . Too cold , too slippery . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Old Patent Office Building  --  a Greek Revival gem once described by Walt ' Whitman as " the noblest of Washington buildings " ? and saw its current show , " Abroad in America : Visitors to the New Nation , 1776-1914 . " Amidst the massive peacefulness and great elegance of the building , quotations from distinguished visitors to American shores caught my eye , including Harriet Martineau 's " I regard the American people as a great embryo poet : now moody , now wild .... There is the strongest hope of a nation that is capable of tieing possessed with an idea . " The past swept up and over , and I walked through the stately Lincoln Gallery , where his second Inaugural Ball had taken place , and through high-ceilinged rooms now hung with American art . Two nights before the Inauguration , an increasing excitement in the streets . Bitter , near-zero weather for the fireworks near the Washington Monument . Thousands of people around the Ellipse were seated in their cars , windows tightly closed , waiting for the extravagant display . I braved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people , some in blucjeans , some encased in sleeping bags . The show lasted a full half hour  --  fountains , skyrockets , gerhs , flowerpots , wheels  --  to the accompaniment of band music . Here and there , people yelled " Hooray ! " in the clear , cold night . There were guards in all the small guardhouses behind the fence of the White House , and they seemed to be cozily minding their business , and staying warm . Birds were talking in the magnolia trees behind the White House , cold or no cold . They were determined to say what they wanted to say . A guard suddenly came around the outside of the fence and directed his flashlight at the thick White House hushes . Nobody there . No danger tonight . One day before the Inauguration . The doorman at the hotel complained that his earmuffs did n't fit him properly . In short , his ears were cold . Went off to the reception for the Mondales at the Old Pension Building  --  highroofed , massive , designed by General Montgomery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Old Red Barn . But fashions change and Presidents change , and the old Italian Pala zzo-cu m-Vic to ria n-styl e building is now overwhelming , with its interior court two hundred and ninety-two feet long and its Corinthian columns one hundred and fifty-nine FEBRUARY 7 19 7 7 feet high . Cleveland 's Inau-gural Ball , held there on March 4 , 1885 , was the first since the Civil War to he attended by great numbers of Southerners . The imposing pillars were originally painted to look like Siena marble . Mr. and Mrs. Mondale  --  direct , friendly , at ease  --  stood in a receiving line just below the Air Force Strolling Strings . They greeted every-body who stepped up , and what seemed like thousands stepped up . Spotted Averell Harriman in a greatcoat , looking trim , tanned , and young . Spotted Treasury Secretary-designate Michael Blumenthal , Peter Rodino , Al Shanker . Noted Geor-gia fruitcakes , strawberries , watercress sandwiches , Joan Mondale 's pumpkin bread , drinks . Mondale was in a sober dark-blue suit and dark tic , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Con-gress and for reunifying the nation behind principles that had made the nation great . We were all getting into the spirit now . I went down to the Library of Congress cafe-teria for some fried chicken . Later , after dusk , I went to the Longworth House Office Building , on Capitol Hill , for a party of the Georgia State Society , held in the cafeteria of that building ? low ceiling , stainless-steel equipment , pipes , coffee urns , the cafeteria decor enlivened by lots of balloons and bunt-ing and puffs of colored paper . The Georgians were happy , and they were gracious . They were being entertained by a four-piece combo  --  the Gran jazz , of Griffin , Georgia . Met a Mr. M. Yoshida , whose card , instantly offered , identified him as executive vice-president of .5'Kl . Zipper ( U.S.A. ) , Inc. , with offices in Lyndhurst , New Jersey , and two hundred and fifty employees in Macon , Georgia . He said that when Carter was Governor of Georgia he had encouraged Japanese investment there as part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carter ; he was also pleased with the zipper busi-ness . Yummy things at the Georgia State party : spiced shrimp , crab salad , sides of beef , rare . Back onto glazed streets . House and Senate office build-ings brightly lighted , corridors mobbed , hundreds of people pouring through to THE NEW YORKER 27 one party or another . Slid over to Library of Congress , and to the free concert , in the Coolidge Auditorium , of the Western Wind Vocal Ensemble ( under Inaugural auspices ) , singing songs from the singing schools of the Revolutionary and Federal periods . Hall jammed  --  scores of young people carrying knapsacks . Left Library of Congress , wondered about transportation , and was hailed by a quiet woman in a station wagon , who said , " Hop in . It 's too cold to walk . I 'll take you where you want to go . " Took advantage of her hospitality and asked if she would drive past Blair House . Carter had arrived a few hours earlier and was in residence there . Not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squarely behind the glass front door , his arms crossed , guarding the President-elect . But there did n't seem to he much danger that night , either . Inauguration Day . Bright sky again , but the temperature up a hit . Still a great chill in the air . Stopped off at a drugstore at Seventeenth and K Streets shortly after 9 A.M. and was told by an excited clerk that if I would just wait a moment John Wayne would be right hack to pick up a prescription . Said I had to hurry along to the Capitol and watch the swearing in of a new President . Took a stunning subway , with soft lights and orange-and-beige seats , on an almost noiseless ride to Union Station . Military guards everywhere , examining credentials , but politeness , soft speaking , and smiles were the order of the day on Capitol Hill . Marines were in dress uniform , and the one who took my ticket had no overcoat  --  his teeth chattered . Sat clown just below the stand where the President was to take the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already filled the East Plaza on Capitol Hill and was backed up all the way to the steps of the Senate office buildings and the Supreme Court . Senators and representatives filed in and took their places to right and left of the Inaugural platform . The United States Marine Band was massed below and in front of the platform , and in front of the Marine Band was a **28;5436;TOOLONG all-black choir , both men and women  --  the Atlanta University Center Chorus , led by Dr. Wendell P. Whalum . The crowd was very quiet while assembling , but there was something unmistakably emotional in the air . Some of the emotion burst through when the choir sang " The Battle Hymn of the Republic . " President-elect Carter took the oath . When he paid his unexpected tribute to his predecessor , an unknown young lady seated next to me apologized for some tears trickling down her cheeks . They quickly froze . When President Carter said , so softly that it could barely be heard , " We are a strong nation and we will maintain strength @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  a quiet strength based not merely on the size of an arsenal but on the nobility of ideas , " the " special " people on the platform and directly in front made no stir , but from the anonymous crowds far back came a roaring wave of applause . He had been heard back there . President Carter 's and Mrs. Carter 's long , steady outdoor stride down Pennsylvania Avenue , the cries of " He 's walking ! He 's walking ! , " the Carters ' brief and relaxed-looking appearances at the Inaugural Parties ( formerly Balls ) ? I hold these in my mind . But I also hold some words that Oliver Wendell Holmes spoke in 1913 , at a dinner of the Harvard Law School Association of New York : " It was evening . I was walking homeward on Pennsylvania Avenue near the Treasury , and as I looked beyond Sherman 's statue to the west the sky was aflame with scarlet and crimson from the setting sun . But , like the note of downfall in Wagner 's opera , below @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the electric lights . And I thought to myself the GOtterammerung will end , and from those globes clustered like evil eggs will come the new masters of the sky . It is like the time in which we live . But then I remembered the faith that I partly have expressed , faith in a universe not measured by our fears , a universe that has thought and more than thought inside of it , and as I gazed , after the sunset and above the electric lights there shone the stars . " Sale AN ad that recently ran in the sports section of the Times caught our eye , because it bore the still familiar logo of last summer 's Olympics . The ad disclosed that eleven " Super olympian pole vault pits " and an equal number of " Super olympian high jump pits " ( all accompanied by base units , top pads , and , in the case of the vaulting pits , full fronts ) were for sale in Montreal at reduced prices . Interested parties were invited to phone Anthony R. Nelson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1976 Olympic Games . We phoned . Mr. Nelson told us that the response had been highly gratifying , and that , indeed , if all the people who had already said they wanted Olympic pits actually followed through , he 'd he sold out . " We do n't deliver , " he said , " and we do n't consider a sale confirmed until customers arrive to pick up their pits . When we acquired them , they were vacuum-packed , but now they 're open , and harder to transport , though we believe you could squeeze four of them into a single very large truck . " What was he asking per pit ? " Thirteen hundred and sixty dollars for the pole-vaults , which are larger and heavier , and eleven hundred and twenty for the high-jumps , " he said . We fleetingly pondered inquiring about trade-ins , then moved on to sales taxes or other extras . No extras , Mr. Nelson said . " All our inquiries to date have come from New York and New Jersey , " he event on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because we figured that to move them very far would he prohibitively expensive . " What shape were the pits in ? " These , of course , are more luxurious than most pits , because they have wide dimensions and special density of foam , " he said . " They 're first-rate pits  --  though , naturally , used . " What sort of people were his prospective customers ? " Mostly institutions  --  schools and colleges , " Mr. Nelson replied " Although there was one call from an individual who said he was interested in buying a pit for his hack yard ; it seems his son is on a high-school track team . " Did the sale include the pits employed in the main stadium during the Games , and , if so , would they be going at a premium ? " Unfortunately , all the pits were moved together into a warehouse before we contemplated this sale , and we have no way of knowing now which were used for practice and which in actual competitions , " Mr. Nelson said . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the entire lot , which will he applied to the deficit of the Games . I do n't know what the final deficit will he , but I 'm afraid that this sum , however welcome , wo n't make a significant dent in it . " As we go to press , there are three pits left . The number to call in Montreal is ( 514 ) - 286- 3396 , if you have a teen-age daughter or son who needs a pit . Stepping Out HARVEY 'S CHELSEA RESTAURANT , a spot that , if we were in the restaurant-rating business , would certainly garner four silk hats for the care and attention and intelligence of the staff , and four monocles for the actual enjoyment experienced by the customer , is the work of Dick Harvey , a young restaurateur who seems to be turning into a one-man Landmarks Preservation Commission . According to Harvey , what he does is see places he falls in love with and then has to figure out how to try to pay for . Four years ago , Harvey , then twenty-eight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including O'Nea/ 's Baloon , opposite Lincoln Center ( he 's still legendary among New York barkeeps as the fastest bartender who has ever worked New York ; O'Neal 's is the kind of place that can get packed in a minute and a half during an intermission ) , reopened the Landmark Tavern as a faithful reconstruction of a turn-ofthe-century New York Irish bar-and-restaurant , on the original site , at Eleventh Avenue and Forty-sixth Street  --  a place that within not very many months became ( by word of mouth , since Harvey does n't like to advertise ) a favorite midtown hangout . Harvey , who enjoys work , put in eighteen-hour days for over a year , and finally allowed himself a vacation . He went out to Hampton Bays for three weeks and tended bar at a place a friend owned . Harvey has now given the Harvey treatment to a handsome old German family-style restaurant , the Old Chelsea Restaurant , on the south side of Eighteenth Street just west of Sixth Avenue . It reopened shortly before Christmas , on a then unexpectedly frigid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yorkers in the know are already beating a path to its door , because nothing delights a New Yorker more than being able to say to another New Yorker , " I 've discovered a little spot you 'll like . " I The Chelsea first opened its doors in 1889 , in an era when Sixth Avenue , around the corner , was the home of the biggest department stores in the city . Some of these beached whales , now transformed into industrial lofts , still loom nearby . It boasted a forty-footlong bar of burled red mahogany constructed with incredible love by a team of Anheuser-Busch craftsmen who were being sent around the country in those days to make showpieces and help restaurants get on their feet . The bar had rear cabinets fronted by bevelled glass etched with silver sunbursts , and as pretty as any glass ever seen around here ; a brass seven-day clock that filled one cabinet and surmounted an enormous and solemn brass pendulum ; and a marble step instead of a rail at its base up front , so burghers in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ style . The Chelsea hung on , precariously , for years after the department stores had gone their way uptown , and finally shut down for good a year ago  --  which was about when Dick Harvey caught sight of it and decided to go to work . What Harvey has done -- besides refinishing the mahogany and installing new mahogany wainscotting to match and an intricate Victorian arched room divider beyond the bar to give the back of the restaurant more privacy and quiet ( he found the room divider all in pieces in a shop on Hudson Street and had to assemble it like a jigsaw puzzle ) ? is add five wonderful chandeliers , two of them antiques with cut-glass globes , and the others ( with frosted-glass globes from France ) specially made for the restaurant , and stock the bar with a historic display of bar-andrestaurant glassware . Harvey 's dad , in Ohio , works for Anchor Hocking , a big glass firm , and he grew up with a fine eye for the best . So the bar has six-ounce stemware Martini glasses , fourteen-ounce Collins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty-four-ounce balloon brandy snifters , and tall , thin-lipped Pilsner glasses . ( Harvey says there are few things worse than drinking beer out of fat-lipped glasses . ) There 's also a smaller room downstairs , suitable for private parties . The Chelsea is open seven days a week , noon to midnight , and features simple dishes elegantly prepared and cooked fresh to order  --  real shepherd 's pie , for instance , which is quite an experience for anyone who only remembers it from the school-lunchroom steam counter , and a German lamb stew , a portion of which is big enough to make a German 's eyes pop . Every diner gets a fresh hot loaf of home-baked soda bread , but watch out ! One bite , and you finish the whole loaf . A Sunday-brunch ( noon to five ) option is a five-egg omelette . Service has to meet the standards that Harvey has always set for himself . Bartenders are expected to empty and clean an ashtray after every cigarette , and only bottled soda is ever used  --  not splashes from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insures a good run , the weekend before Harvey 's Chelsea Restaurant opened will give it the life span of Fraunces Tavern : on Saturday , the refrigerators conked out and the food spoiled ; Sunday night , the draught-beer lines from the cellar snapped , flooding the bar ; then , on opening day , Monday , the drains stopped up and the dishwasher would n't work ; and when the whole mess was cleaned up the Ansul fire system in the kitchen activated itself , spraying everything with flame-suppressant powder . Harvey was about to padlock the door and send his staff home , but then a couple of people came in for lunch . So he said " What the hell ! " and broke out laughing and stayed open . The lunches emerged after only a short delay , and no one who had n't been told ever realized anything was amiss . Since then , Harvey 's Chelsea has n't had any problems at all . Underestimated Duck WHETHER it will destabilize the rest of the economy remains to be seen , but the market in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been hearing rumors of particularly irresponsible profiteering in back issues of Howard the Duck . When we refer to Howard the Duck  --  not to be confused with any other Howard or any other duck  --  we mean the extravagantly anthropomorphized bright light in the Marvel Comics publishing empire . Howard looks exactly like a cartoon duck , smokes cigars , subscribes to mainstream Social Darwinism , occasionally gets headaches , often sounds like a web-footed Eric Hoffer , and , in times of personal crisis , reassures himself with claims like " I 'm my own duck ! I go where I want , say what I want ! " Just like the rest of us . A few days ago , we received a phone call from a thirteen-year-old named Jason , who lives in the Midwest and owns copies of all ten extant issues of Howard the Duck , plus a copy of every issue ever published of Daredevil , Conan , XMen , and ilvengers , and most of the back numbers of Incredible Hulk and Fantastic Four . " Look out for Howard the Duck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a copy of Howard the Duck No. 1 , the first issue , sold at a comic-book convention in New York for eighteen dollars and seventy-five cents . " This piece of information inspired us to do some research  --  research that leads us to the conclusion that Howard the Duck No. l 's selling at eighteen dollars and seventy-five cents has less to do with a nostalgic fondness for old comic books than with an immediate fondness for new money . A copy of a fresh issue of Howard the Duck now retails for thirty cents  --  the price that was in effect when Howard the Duck No. 1 hit the newsstands , fifteen months ago . Turmoil developed , however , because large numbers of the first issue of Howard never actually reached the newsstands or were immediately bought up in large quantities by mysterious speculators . When this happened , something resembling a panic ensued . It appears that a Howard the Duck-shortage panic is several quantum leaps more disorienting than a coffee-shortage panic or a soybean-short-            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
