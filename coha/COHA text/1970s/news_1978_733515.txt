txt The Israeli Cabinet decided today not to change its policy on settlements in occupied Arab lands . The action approved . the Begin Government 's plan to expand Jewish.set7 tlements in northern Sinai and establish three new ones on the West Bank ' of the Jordan River . The Cabinet's. decision was announced after an . eight-hour debate that began at a special session on Monday and continued at the regular weekly : session today . In the days between , there was speculation here that Prime Minister Mina-. chem Begin 's Government would freeze or alter its settlement policy to ease ' the growing strain that the . issue . has caused between Israel and the United States , Tense State of Negotiations It was also expected that , the policy would be suspended because of the tense state of negotiations between ' Egypt and Israel . President Anwar el-Sadat of Egypt has mentioned the northern Sinai settlements with regard to Israel 's sincerity in responding to his peace initiative , , State Department officials in Washington had no formal comment on the Israeli Cabinet 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major policy ; changes before Mr. Begin 's visit lo.the United States next month . Today Aryeh Naor , Israel 's Cabinet Secretary , read a brief , statement to reporters , written by Mr. Begin , that ' said the Cabinet had decided there was no need at this time ' for any new decision regarding the settlements in the occupied territories or with respect to the current political situation . Mr .. Naor refused to say whether the decision was unanimous , but there were strong indications that it was not . The Democratic Movement - for Change , , a member of Mr. Begin 's coalition Government , said a few days ago that it favored a freeze on the settlements .

The three planned West Bank settlements are near Israeli military camps . One , Tel Kharls , in the western part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settlement . The other two  --  Tapuach , about six miles from the Arab town of Nablus , and Silt-a-Dahar , north of Nablus  --  are scheduled to become civilian communities by the end of March . Israel 's settlement policy on Arab lands has long ' been criticized by the United States as illegal and as posing an " obstacle to peace . ' In recent weeks , the Carter Administration has been increasingly critical of the Begin Government on the settlements , calling some of them " duplicitous , " such as the one at the site of ancient Shiloh , which Israel termed an archeological dig . The issue has caused friction within Mr. Begin 's coalition , which is led by the Likud bloc . On ? one side , Defense Minister Ezer Weizman is said to have called for a cessation of settlement activity at a time of delicate negotiations with the Egyptians . On the other side , Agriculture Minister Ariel Sharon , who is responsible for carrying out the settlements policy , is pressing for major new developments . Today 's decision was viewed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' views . A few weeks ago , Mr. Weizman , who as Defense Minister is in charge of the occupied lands , ordered a halt in settlement expansion work in northern Sinai . Today 's Cabinet move does not negate that order , but neither does it withdraw the Cabinet 's previously espoused commitment to expand existing settlements on Egyptian land south of the Gaza Strip . Negotiations in Virtual Suspension The Cabinet debate was called in an atmosphere of American criticism of the settlements and at a time when the negotiations with Egypt are in virtual suspension . The decision to reaffirm existing policy came at a time when the special American envoy , Alfred L. Atherton Jr . is shuttling between Cairo and Jerusalem in an effort to establish a mutually agreeable declaration of principles between Israel . and Egypt for achieving Middle East peace . Mr. Atherton returned from Cairo Friday night with a Egyptian counterproposal for such declaration , apparently in response to an Israeli draft that he took with him to Cairo after a visit here last week . There were reports here that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ views . The major obstacles to a declaration have focused on how to phrase the section . dealing ' with the Palestinians , and on Mr. Sadat 's insistence that Israel express a Willingness to withdraw from all the territories seized during the 1967 war . Hussein 's Participation Crucial Over the weekend , Foreign Minister Moshe Dayan told a radio interviewer that the Egyptian stance was hardening because Mr. Sadat had been unable thus far to induce King Hussein of Jordan to attend the negotiations . The King 's participation is believed here to be crucial to discussion of the fate of the West bank and Gaza Palestinians , Mr. Atherton met with Mr. Dayan last night , and the Foreign Minister has not revised his previous remarks , adding to the conviction that the Egyptian line has hardened . Mr. Atherton is scheduled to meet with Mr. Begin tomorrow on the latest moves to get the Egyptian-Israeli talks Boling again .
