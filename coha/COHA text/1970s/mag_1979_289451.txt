Feeding back " excess " profits <P> <P> In full-page ads across the country , Sears , Roebuck &; Co. trumpeted a 5% reduction in its catalogue prices as a " voluntary " move " to help fight inflation . " But the sudden-and suspect-volunteerism came after weeks of rising pressure from the Council on Wage and Price Stability ( COWPS ) and a phone call to the company 's Chicago headquarters from none other than Jimmy Carter . It was the President 's first such jawboning-by-wire , and the highest official he could reach was the senior vice president for public affairs ; the others were out to lunch , and Chairman Edward Telling was in an airplane flying over Kansas at the time . <P> Sears may have been the target because it is the world 's largest retailer ( 1978 sales : $18 billion ) , and a victory would give a lift to Carter 's price fight . Surely a boost is needed . Consumer prices rose at a 13% annual rate in the first quarter , and wholesale prices for April were reported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , despite declines for some foods , including pork and coffee . <P> The Administration claims that in the six months through last January , Sears increased prices at an annual pace of 4.2% , well over the 3.2% allowed it by COWPS . The rollback is designed to bring the company into line with the Government 's guidepost for the year and feed back to the public any " excess " profits . About 20% of Sears ' business is catalogue sales , and the company will automatically send refunds to any customers who mail in too much money . Sears also will make " selective ' ' price reductions in its stores . <P> The move stands to do more to burnish the public relations image of Carter 's anti-inflation commandos-and Sears-than to contain overall U.S. prices . First , inflation in general retailing has been relatively modest , averaging well under 5% over the past five years . Second , Sears ' major competitors , including J.C . Penney , K mart and Montgomery Ward , do not intend to cut prices . <P> Quite possibly , Sears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acted . The company 's sales have slumped for eight consecutive months , largely because it moved away from discounting in an effort to improve profit margins . Now Sears can claim that price reductions are an act of inflation-fighting patriotism instead of a necessary step to woo back customers , and it can blame any lower profits on Government pressure to cut . <P> In any case , the company has the last laugh . One of its executives was suffering from a bad case of flu when he met with COWPS officials in Washington after the President 's phone call . Some time later COWPS Director Barry Bosworth and several other agency officials were put to bed with what their colleagues are calling " Sears ' revenge . "
