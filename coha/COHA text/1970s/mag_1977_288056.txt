Conferences for novices <P> If I had to give young writers advice , I would say , ' Do n't listen to writers talking about writing or about themselves . ' " So said Playwright Lillian Hellman , but America 's aspiring authors obviously disagree . This summer would-be poets , playwrights and authors flocked to some 90 conferences across the country to learn about style and craft from established writers and to submit their own work for review . Special interest groups had their own gatherings : a Mystery Writers ' Conference in Aptos , Calif. ; a New England Conference in Children 's Literature at Northampton , Mass . Beach-loving authors could even soak up inspiration at the Caribbean Writers ' Workshop in the Virgin Islands . <P> But the most prestigious conference was , as it has always been , Bread Loaf , the venerable grandfather of the breed . Founded in 1926 , and made famous by Robert Frost 's presence for 27 years , Bread Loaf is held in late August on Middlebury College 's 2,000-acre Bread Loaf campus , high in Vermont @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from 650 applicants-converged on the campus ' Victorian inn and cluster of yellow cottages for the twelve-day session . Ranging in age from 17 to 78 , the participants included 66 teachers , 15 lawyers and executives , and even a bank-vault attendant . They came armed with fledgling manuscripts and beginners ' questions for the 14-member staff , which this year numbered , among other notables , Novelist John Gardner , author of Chaucer , Grendel and the Pulitzer-prize-winning October Light ; Poet William Meredith , who teaches at Connecticut College , and Maxine Kumin , whose Up Country won the 1973 Pulitzer Prize for poetry . <P> Contributing writers paid $265 tuition to attend lectures and have a manuscript evaluated , while auditors were billed $235 to take part in the sessions . <P> <P> All were immersed in lectures , readings and discussion groups from the 7:30 reveille gong each morning through a final 8 p.m. session . A typical meeting convened high in the loft of Bread Loaf 's huge converted barn , where ten eager fiction writers ringed John Irving , an assistant professor at Mount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrestler , Irving listened sympathetically while one man described how he had chosen the wrong narrator for his story and then had to stop when " I realized what I was writing were lies . " Irving admitted that he had once had to discard about 100 pages and start all over again . He suggested that first-person narrative was a good device for new writers . Said he : " It makes the story sound like a family album . The ' I was there ' is one of the most reassuring voices in fiction . " <P> When someone asked for a foolproof formula to get a story going , Irving said : " Whatever gets you started is fine . " He had few kind words for procrastinators : " You 've got to be able to write when you do n't have time to write . " How can you tell if your work is any good ? Irving 's advice : " Read it aloud to someone you know well and trust . Faces do n't lie . "        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
