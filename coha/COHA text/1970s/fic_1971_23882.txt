a story by Gloria Kurian Broder ELENA , UNFAITHFUL LEXEI SAZEVITCH leapt out of the barber 's chair and looked into the mirror after his haircut , and when he saw that he was exceptionally handsome for his age , he decided to retire . From his office he placed a call to his childhood friend , Andre , who lived in Paris , and said , " I 'm stopping this nonsense , Andre . From now on I intend to spend all my time with Elena . " She 's getting younger and prettier , " he told Andre , though in fact he thought she was getting older and homelier . After that , he descended a long flight of stairs to the office of a man he knew only slightly , but who was also a Russian by birth and an engineer , and leaning on the man 's desk with the palms of his hands , he confided , " Rothkovitch . . . Rothkovitch . . . I have four children  --  Arianne , Eva . Ilya , and Katya . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thank God , and my wife is not growing any younger or thinner ; she 's not like you and me " ? he punched Rothkovitch in the stomach and planted a cigar in Rothkovitch 's pocket ? " so I 've decided to stop all this and retire . " Finally , Alexei gave his secretary a silk scarf , a scarf unusual for being so long . After she had unwound it and wound it up again , Alexei noisily kissed her on the mouth and tossed her in the direction of the radiator . Forcefully he grasped and shook the hands of the rest of his staff and at last went down in the elevator carrying his framed diplomas ; a silver plaque for designing the Elgar Bridge ; two brass cups for jumping overboard and saving lives at the scene of that bridge ; a wedding picture of his mother and father ; and a large , embossed , half-eaten box of Ghiradelli chocolates . He put all of these in the back seat of his Bentley and drove through Detroit , cruising one-handedly through streets arched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rows of brick-faced houses offering their ancient , cracked , cement porches , out into the raw , bleak avenues of tire and automotive supply stores , and finally beyond , to his own neighborhood of wide and utterly isolated lawns . " Elena , Elena , " he shouted at the front door . And when his wife appeared , he greeted her : " From this moment on , my darling girl , I willspend each and every moment at home with you ! " At these words it seemed to him that Elena 's eyes started up and that she turned peculiarly pale . But he was altogether unprepared when , two days later , she took ill and died . The entire family went to the funeral and the priest read a eulogy . Alexei could not believe anything like this had happened . He caught a cold and felt numb . All the same , grief  --  which he did not like , which he had always hid from  --  threatened to visit him , while terrible questions pushed their way into his clogged mind , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's forty-five years together , treated her well enough for a European husband of average morality who was the head of his house and irresistible to women ? On her last birthday , had he written a large enough check to Products for the Blind ? And why had he gone fishing with his friend , Vassily , and their redheaded , then their brunette , mistresses on the very day that his second daughter , Eva , was born ? the following year when Ilya was born ? two mornings after the premature arrival of Katya , and exactly one week later , on the Fourth of July ? Alexei blamed his naivete most of all . He had thought , initially , that his children would somehow look better . But no , in the early years he had always seemed to come upon them sitting on the linoleum in the pantry in wet snowsuits , holding out their swathed and dripping arms . " Papa , Papa , " they would urge , while he would take a few steps back and as a young father observe that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mannerisms he was not prepared for . From the very beginning , Arianne was too awkward , Eva too mean , Ilya too pulling , and Katya unaccountably squashy and low to the ground . " Think of the poor , " Elena sang to them in their cradles , training them for good deeds . " Think of the poor , " she warned them , each time he took off for a weekend . Busily , she sent forth baskets of fruit and new shoes , mailed out letters to the city council , and steadily brought in painting after painting of hefty-looking fruit , which she bought from starving artists . Nor was he , Alexei , exempt either , for each time he headed for the door , carrying suitcases , Elena would unlock his fingers , take hold of both of his hands , gaze into his eyes and say , " Alexei Mihailovitch , think once more about the poor . " On these occasions he understood she spoke about herself . H AD IT BEEN all his fault then , he wondered . Vas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his head cleared , and for a brief time he faced the fact that Elena had died ; but he was a man who had always hid from unhappiness , who now grew aware that a terrible horizon of pain waited in the distance for him like a bank of fog . Massing together , it thickened and inexorably moved closer . In his sleep he moaned ; he called out for Elena , and awoke each day feeling drugged and dizzy . Then in the middle of one night Birdie , the old housekeeper , brought him ice water , and after drinking it he fell asleep and dreamed of love , of youth , of bands of handsome , free , unfettered people moving along the banks of a rich , green river . Violets and poppies embroidered the meadows and a scent of lilac inundated the air while he  --  only he could not be certain it was he  --  and Elena danced , wandering amidst it all . In the morning he woke up feeling sensual , played upon , vulnerable to desire ; and with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of bed , crossed the carpeted bedroom , thrust open the windows , and , lookinglight-heartedly out onto Elena 's garden , understood in the sweet , wild , and pungent summer air that Elena Petrovna had not died after all : she had simply run off with another man  --  very likely with a man who still worked  --  and she was happy . Tears of gratitude glistened in Alexei 's eyes . A photograph of Elena stood on the dresser . " Look at you ! " he exclaimed , pressing the cardboard between his fingers . " Fifty pounds overweight , hair in braids like my great-grandmother , bags under your eyes , forever taking your shoes off and leaving them where I can trip  --  unable to wear a pair of shoes comfortably for more than five minutes  --  talking on and on about Congress , the war , the poor  --  and yet . .. yet I 've misjudged you , I 've never fully known what you arep. , He kissed the photograph , leaving wet marks , put it down , opened Elena @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ umbrella and a folding chair , it was empty . She had taken all of her clothes , he thought , which was just as well since she did not own very many . His own wardrobe exceeded hers by ten times . Alexei went to the phone . He wanted to ring up people and tell them his news . He would say to Vassily , " Vassily , just think of it  --  Elena 's going off like that . Is n't it unusual , is n't it ironic ! " But as luck would have it he had recently kicked Vassily out of his house . And then , David I tchkawkch I Si he debated , if he placed a call to Andre , there was a good chance Andre might misjudge his marriage  --  after all , they had not seen each other in thirty years . As for his children , they doted and depended on their mother much too much : finally he did not wish to cause them any pain . His hand still on the phone , for a moment Alexei considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes already held the knowledge of hundreds , perhaps even thousands , of different lives . Unfortunately , he thought , he did not know that lady . He took the umbrella from Elena 's closet and went downstairs , still wearing his robe . Through the double glass doors that led into the living room he saw Birdie dusting the furniture with a feather duster , her hand moving like a pendulum as she mechanically turned here and there , touching the worn , rose-colored satin setee and couches , the samovar on the coffee table , the mended china lamps and clocks . He opened the glass doors and stepped in , then stepped out as a smell of stale oranges and apples rushed at him from the framed pictures of fruit on all the walls . Stepping in again , he shut the glass doors behind him . " Birdie , " he said , thinking perhaps she should be the first to know . After all , she had helped diaper and she had stuck pins , he conjectured , into all four of his children . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her on the back and shout into her good ear , " Birdie , you old vixen , you demon ! Just guess what your mistress has gone and done ! " He decided not . She would not believe him ; worse still , she might say nothing at all . " Birdie , whose umbrella is this ? " She took it from him and looked at it for a long time . " It 's Arianne 's . She left it here last week , when it rained . " Then she walked past him with the umbrella , which she put in a closet in the front hall . " Arianne ! " he exclaimed ; Arianne , he thought . Why had n't he singled her out from the others ? She was his eldest daughter , the only one at whose birth he 'd been present , the only child who had grown up as tall as he , with shoulders practically as broad ; who beat him at badminton , who was more of a son to him than his other daughters or his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at family gatherings until late in the night , when they would smile at one another , clasp their arms about each other 's powerful shoulders , and loudly chorus " Auld Lang Syne . " H E RUSHED TO THE PHONE in the den , and when she answered in the familiar , hearty voice that cracked in between syllables due to hoarseness and the headlong intensity of her goodwill , he leaned way back in the swivel chair behind the desk , stretched out his legs , and to the ceiling trilled out , " A .. ri anne , A .. ri anne ! " " Papa , I 'm glad you called . I was just about to call and ask you how things are . " " They 're wonderful . " " I 'm glad to hear that . " " Yes , they 're perfect , " he offered again . happy with such an exchange . Arianne , he thought , smiling broadly , was always cheerful . Unfortunately this virtue had also become her failing and he conceded that it even showed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neck she stood as proudly as a colt or soldier , her head with its close-cropped , curly , dark hair tended to droop , and on her gaunt and pleasant face loomed the resigned and tragic expression of one who can never publicly come up with any but jovial things to say . " How are your husband and children ? " he asked her . " We 're all first rate . " " Excellent . How is the dog ? " " Getting much better . Thank you very much for asking . " " How is the cat ? " " Papa , uh ... we do n't have a cat . " " Never mind then ; forget that I asked you . " He leaned into the phone . " Arianne . I have something to tell you . " A surge of anticipation welled up inside of him . " Your mother 's gone . . . she 's gone . . . shopping . " His heart sank ; he felt that he had failed . He let out his breath . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with no crack in her voice this time , " Papa , what did you say ? " " I said she 's gone shopping . " The statement sounded plausible enough to him except , of course , that everyone knew Elena never went shopping : it was always he who spent his spare time riding escalators in search of the latest , most elegant accessory from Italy or France . " Papa , what did you say ? " " She 's gone .. . " unsuccessfully , he tried again , " she 's gone shopping . " " Listen , Papa , do n't think about it . You have a point . Do n't think about it and I 'll come see you at two this afternoon . You have a point . There are good sales all over town . There are excellent sales in all the shopping centers . " She hung up . Downcast , Alexei remained seated at the desk , thinking that if only he had been able to tell Arianne the truth about her mother , he might have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his competitors ' work on bridges , and his own work ; and how Vassily , after marrying a dreadful woman too late in his life , had forgotten the names of all their mistresses . Subsequently he and Vassily had had nothing to talk about ; they 'd quarreled over cards : at last Alexei threw him out of the door . Brooding stonily in the swivel chair , Alexei turned prey to old irritations . Why , he won- dered  --  as he had often wondered why had Arianne , on the morning before her marriage , jumped into her mother 's lap and remained there for half an hour when she was twice the size of Elena and might just as easily have jumped into his ? Rehearsing these tales , Alexei 's eyes began to flicker , his fingers to touch and move an ashtray , a letter opener on the desk , until all at once he grew impatient , jumped up and ran into the front hall . " Breakfast , Birdie , " he called , " right after my shower . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bathroom , went into the bedroom and slid open the doors of his wall-to-wall , beloved closet . At this instant , the phone rang . " Father ? " " Eva ? " " I hear that mother 's gone shopping . " E VA 'S VOICE , suspicious and complaining at best , now snapped and accused . Alexei held the receiver a distance from his ear and inured himself by gazing at the orderly array of suits , trousers , jackets , vests , and coats that hung from wall to wall , harmoniously arranged by color . It was a sight he found soothing and peaceful , but which angered Eva , for whenever she visited the house , after she had eaten up all the scraps in the icebox , opened and searched in every drawer for childhood mementos , stormed abstractly through the basement and sniffed into the attic , she invariably ended up by confronting his clothes . " Fifty-one suits , " she would declare , pointing to them with a long , ink-stained , crooked finger . " It 's disgusting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 're not for the poor , " Alexei would inform her , very simply , " they 're for me . " Sometimes Katya would follow her sister to Alexei 's closet . Katya was the baby . She was plump , with chubby upper arms Alexei liked to pinch . She had a small , cupid 's face with hair planted on top of her head like a robin 's nest ; she had short legs and wore long dresses with uneven hems : and instead of becoming a ballet dancer , as Alexei had hoped , she had gone petulantly , yet unhesitatingly , into social work . Hair pins fell from her head , and like Eva , she said , " Give some to the poor . " And on occasion Ilya would wander in and , standing with his nose comfortably inside Alexei 's closet and his hands on his hips , would inquire with a show of great kindness and concern , " Papa , what are you trying to prove ? Why do you have so many clothes ? " Alexei would answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in these ecologically troubled times , do you have nine children ? Why do you always only act in plays by Gorki ? " ? to which Ilya would raise his head high and , with heartfelt sincerity and the voice projection of an actor , solemnly intone , " At least I do n't have so many clothes . " I A THAT , " EVA NOW PURSUED , as she liked her V facts to fit , " what did mother go shopping for ? " Alexei frowned into the phone . " For ? " An expression of pride  --  self-loving and stubborn  --  chiseled itself onto Alexei 's face . He lifted his chin and reflected . " For shoes . Stockings . A dress . A purse . " He paused . He leaned against the bedroom wall and crossed his ankles . " A hat . Some gloves . A bottle of perfume . You ought to go shopping yourself . " He referred , as he knew she understood quite well , to the fact that she always wore an old serape and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and beyond that to the greater facts : that she taught in a ghetto school with hungry , angry dedication ; that she stared glassily at him through thick lenses while clutching an enormous guitar ; that she was bowlegged , vast-hipped , militant about women 's rights , middle-aged , and had never married ; and that more than any of the others , she had been influenced by her mother , but did not have her mother 's grace . Yet the tone of her voice suddenly softened . " Listen , Papa , tell me something . Have you been feeling yourself ? How have you been feeling ? Father . . . Papa , I think I 'll come sleep home tonight . Tell Birdie to put out fresh sheets . " " No , no , no , no ! " " Why not ? " " No. no ! " " I 'd like to . " " I think . . . it occurs to me , " he recovered from her offer , " there 's no need to . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , my dear , you have your own apartment , your own little kitty cats , your guitar .. . " " What I think , " Eva said , " is that I 'll pick Ilya up at the airport at one . That 's when his plane comes in . " " Ilya ? " For an instant he panicked . " Where 's Ilya been ? " " Chicago . Do n't you remember ? In a play . He 's been there for two weeks . " Alexei felt both relief and annoyance . " Gorki again . Why does Ilya only act in plays by old Russians ? Why does n't he act in something modern , up-to-date ? " " Right after that , " Eva went on , ignoring him , " I 'll stop by for Katya at her work and we 'll come to you around two . " " All of you ? " Alexei objected . " All of us , " Eva confirmed , and added before hanging up , " Arianne said she 'd drive over at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He showered and dressed , thinking that his children were coming to see him . What could he do with them ? He came down the stairs , shouting , " Breakfast , Birdie , breakfast ! " and went into the living room to wait . Opening the double glass doors , he stepped on figured rugs that lay on top of the heavy carpet . He glanced about . Pictures of glossy fruit  --  one of peaches and pears , one of plums and pears , one of plums and apples , and one simply of bananas  --  painted by artists , each one more poor , he guessed , than the others  --  hung on three thick , ivory walls , while at the windows heavy drapes kept out the light , the air . He had never liked this room . He had often told his family it was too old-fashioned , too Russian , and they had answered that they were Russian . Each time he came home from an illicit weekend , he had wanted to tear out walls , put in a bold expanse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couch . But Elena pleaded that he had his office and his outings and that this was her room . She began to go out less and less . She grew heavier , closer to life , less willing to keep on her shoes . Neighbors , teachers , other Europeans , and her own four children came to see her ? brought her their troubles  --  as she sat on the worn , rose-colored satin settee , listening through long winter afternoons , her shoes paired next to her and two bunions on her toes . While she listened , her fingers peeled and divided an orange . and he remembered that her lips would first purse together as if they could taste each trouble and then grow round as if they were labeling and judging the trouble as " pretty good " or " pretty bad . " After that , her manner changed . She gave advice . Handing around sections of the fruit , she tossed her head , her black eyes gleamed like a girl 's amidst their bed of wrinkles , a high color rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her grand and battered chins  --  jumped about with a certain ebullience and style . Watching her in those last few years , Alexei 's throat had closed ; he had wanted those bursts of animation for himself . At the same time he eyed her audience , wondering if her opinions had come to be more respected than his own . How could that be ? He , after all , had built fifteen bridges and designed six exhibits in the 1939 New York World 's Fair where , whenever he turned around , one hundred beautiful women seemed to be concentrating raptly on him . And yet just this past spring , unable to make his presence felt , he had shouted into a group of acquaintances and strangers , " Let me talk , let me talk ! " and then , overcome with shame , with chagrin , had quit the room , fled up the stairs , and placed a call  --  for no good reason  --  to Andre in Paris . Alexei gazed at the rose-colored settee . It was empty ; Elena was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Alexei , let 's not eat cake : let 's eat bread . " She said it liltingly , with humor and in the voice of her youth , the same voice that had promised him a sweet , unjudging , shrewd frivolity forever  --  and then betrayed him . At breakfast , Alexei ate in the dining room , alone , his eyes fixed on the buffet opposite him . Lifting his spoon , he reflected that inside thosecarved and massive drawers , both his and Elena 's family silver was stored and lay together , rested side by side  --  a fact that struck him as so peculiarly intimate and fitting that briefly he faced the idea that Elena had died . But he got up at once and went into the den . Like the other rooms in the downstairs of the house , the den was dark and heavily carpeted . Drapes and venetian blinds hung at the windows . Two brown leather couches , a charcoal drawing of mangoes , and a desk lined the walls . In the center of the desk stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its light-blue color , and the fact that it so easily revolved making it a focal point in the room . Spinning the globe , Alexei 's fingers caught at Rome , St. Tropez. at Venice , and impulsively , as though he were proposing some marvelous vacation by the sea , he urged out loud , " Elena , let 's be young again ! " The sound of his voice shocked him and he retreated up the stairs . There , looking out the window over Elena 's garden , he again smelled honeysuckle , saw fresh primroses , orchids , and daisies , and was once more reassured that Elena had run off with another man and was happy . He phoned the bakery and requested that they send up a cake . Then he lay down on the bed and fell deeply asleep . I iiiHEN HE AWOKE , HE REMEMBERED that his / children were coming to see him , and he felt pleased . He changed his shirt and brushed his hair . On the landing he met Birdie as she inched her way up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with ancient markings . They exchanged awareness of each other but no words and Alexei continued down , saw in the kitchen that his cake had arrived and transferred it to a crystal platter . At two o'clock , he stood outside the front door and heard Eva 's broken muffler in the distance . Presently the camper came into view and Eva maneuvered the vehicle up the driveway , her head craned out one window of the cab , Ilya 's head protruding out the other window , and Katya in between them , staring straight ahead . A few houses down , Arianne parked her VW by the curb and ran at a gallop until she joined the others . The four of them headed up the path . They called , " Papa . . . Papa . " Eva confronted him first . Clasping her guitar with one hand , she removed her glasses with the other and lunged at him , timing her kiss so that it landed in the air . At this she looked wounded and angry , as if it were somehow all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as always by the beauty , not of her features , which were coarse , but of her translucent , pearly skin . She had , if nothing else , inherited his grandmother 's complexion . He said to her , " Try again . " Surprised , Eva obeyed and then stepped back , tripping on her guitar . Katya took her place . She , too , appeared surprised by Alexei 's order . Katya stood on tiptoe . Delicately she bestowed on her father a sweet and prissy peck , then turned her head away . As she was still his baby , this greeting ambiguous though it was  --  pleased and un-did him a bit . " Katya , " he said . " But why are you so thin ? " " I 've lost weight . " Katya , " he mourned , wondering if her husband beat her . He felt in his pocket for a piece of candy and at the same time noticed that her hair had turned entirely gray . " Ah , Katya , you 've lost too much weight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've lost , " she corrected him , proud and plaintive at once , " the right amount . " " Then never mind , " he told her , comforting them both and dismissing her , for behind Katya , Ilya pushed for his turn , and behind Ilya he saw his tall and self-effacing Arianne , a brown paper bag in her hand  --  doubtless it contained brandy ? who registered his awareness of her by signaling above the heads of the others in a voice that croaked like a frog 's , " It 's a most beautiful day , Papa  --  it 's a most beautiful day in summer ! " " Arianne ... Ilya . . . Katya . . . Eva . . . I 'm so happy to see all of you ! " " And we 're so happy to see you , " said llya , stepping forward . He took both of his father 's hands in his and started intently into his father 's eyes as if trying to glean from them something vital and unknown . His moustache quivered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Your mother is n't home . " " We understand , " said Ilya . " She 'll be back quite late . But what I have for you is . . " We understand , " llya said . " She 's gone shopping . ' " She 's gone shopping , " said Katya . " She 's gone shopping , " Arianne confirmed . Alexei felt uncomfortable , but overcame it . " Come in , come in , " he said , holding the door open . " What I have for you is . . . I have some very excellent cake . Birdie did n't make it . Your mother did n't make it either . I got this exceptional cake by ordering it from the bakery . " He led them through the front hail , the dining room , turned to face them by the kitchen . " As you will see , it is chocolate and has icing out of spun sugar and flowers and other such decorations . " Flutelike , his fingers gestured in the air to convey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its sugared avenues and lanes , the possibility of castles . " Now who will help me ? Katya , put on coffee . Eva , bring out cups and plates . What else do we need ? Napkins . Did I forget napkins ? Ilya , see if you can find some napkins . " Alexei carried the cake into the living room , carefully set it down on the dark wood of the inlaid coffee table and sat down in the center of the rose-colored satin settee in what had always been Elena 's place . He bent down to remove his shoes , but straightened up again , feeling foolish . His children arranged themselves in a semicircle around him and appeared fascinated . They had an air of being welcome strangers . Conscious of their mood . Alexei sliced the first piece of cake and meticulously placed it in the perfect center of a plate . He sliced a second , third , and fourth piece and handed these around . He had , he supposed , never served his children before and yet now , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he wanted . 42 H E WATCHED AS THEY BEGAN TO EAT : Eva avidly gobbled , Katya licked . Arianne chewed awkwardly , getting crumbs caught between her teeth and claiming she had never tasted anything better . As for Ilya , his cake went into his mouth and simply disappeared . Alexei smiled . A sense of satisfaction and fulfillment swept subtly over him . He decided he would call in his children 's spouses , even all his grandchildren , despite their bad manners and unkempt hair . To pave the way , he said , " I think . .. it occurs to me ... I have something to tell you . Your mother 's run off ... with a lover . " " Oh , Papa ! " all of them scolded at once and Katya added , " Stop it ! " " Do n't worry , Katya . It will be a nice change for her ; it will do her good . " Arianne objected , " Papa , she would n't do such a thing . " Ilya said , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cried out indignantly , " Listen to that ! Have you ever heard such a thing ! It 's too much ! I ca n't bear it ! " Through thick glasses Eva eyed him steadily and warned , " You 'd better be careful , Father . You 'd better stay off that track . Go back to shopping . " " But I do n't understand , " Alexei told them , shrugging , " you act as if your mother is n't capable of having a lover when , after all , she 's like everyone else in this world ; she 's as capable of carrying on . . . of enjoying herself ... as you and me . " " No more , no more ! " Katya wailed . She stamped her foot . " One more word and I 'll scream . " But Alexei could not stop himself . " Most likely this is not her first lover . Indeed , there is good reason to think , " he went on , lifting a speculative finger into the air , " that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Perhaps some of them were social workers , community workers , teachers , even psychologists  --  yet they were lovers all the same . " But even as he said this  --  even as he recognized its hollow sound  --  he knew he had gone too far . Ilya stood up and faced his father . A sound of muffled choking issued from his throat . From his moustache came a whistle like a train 's . Yet all he could utter was , " Cad ! " A few minutes later he managed , " Bounder ! " Katya fell out of her chair , sideways , and began to sob . Dragging her guitar behind her , Eva started to pace , agitatedly marching up and down the length of the room and in a cold , even voice summing up : " You never deserved her . You never thought of anyone but yourself . " Of the four , only Arianne approached her father . She put a long , large-boned arm around him and tried to chuckle . " You 're mistaken , could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overcome , she moved off to a corner behind the fireplace , dropped into an armchair and covered her face with her hands . Eva continued pacing and narrating , " You never tried to understand her . She was a saint , a free spirit . " From the floor , Katya sent up sharp yelps . Eva stepped over her and went on , " You never cared enough for her ... or for us . You were always too vain , too arrogant , too unfeeling . " Ilya , who had remained rooted to the same spot , his face pale , his neck livid , now grabbed hold of the cake knife , brandished it in the air , gnashed his teeth violently , and cut himself another piece of cake . He then left the room and went into the den to phone his wife . Katya crawled after him ; she phoned her office . Reentering the living room together , the two of them looked about , preparing to resume their angry postures . But in that dim , enclosed room  --  crowded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pictures , upholstery , and samovars of their lives they could not bear the violence of the fury and the anguish that they felt , so that , with a shriek , Katya opened the double glass doors and tumbled through the back hallway . One by one the others followed after her , squeezing through the narrow door and catapulting out into Elena 's garden . And there , surrounded by the green spread of lawn , and under the splendor of the sky , they seemed more easily able to breathe . They said , " Ahhhh ... ahhhh . " Ilya stretched out on a chaise , lifting his face to the sun . Eva uncovered an old guitar behind a rose bush , and gently administered to it . On her hands and knees , Katya picked herself a bouquet of small flowers , and Arianne , her mighty shoulders bent , emerged from the garage with the lawnmower . At once she sent the tall weeds flying . EXEI ISOLATED HIMSELF FROM THEM . Pull- ing a chaise a good distance away , to the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shut his eyes , his head also seeking the summer sun . Instead , in his mind 's eye , he saw the brown , chill winter before snow . He stood on the frozen lawn while his small children ran toward him from the candy store , clasping white paper bags and sticks of licorice in their hands ; calling him , while he , aloof and detached , held off , waited until the last minute when they reached him before embracing and claiming them for his own . Now it was all over , he thought . They could have nothing more to do with one another : he had waited too long . For the first time he wondered whom Elena had run off with , and where they 'd gone . A powerful jealousy invaded him , and almost vengefully he decided he would phone Vassily and say , " Vassily , do you remember those wig models we met in New York City , in that restaurant on 57th Street ? They were eating cannelloni and had ribbons in their hair ? " Vassily 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he would prod it , stir it up . " Remember , you had veal parmigian and I had saltimbocca and those girls were done up just like gift packages ? Vassily , my friend , let 's go to New York and look for them . I 'll take the taller of the two and since you 're so very much shorter ... " But he did not feel like goir ' ' , on . He let his hand drop over the edge of the chaise and plucked a blade of grass , which he put to his mouth . Once , at the beginning of his marriage , he had lain in a field with Elena and tasted one of her toes . He had never done that again , not having particularly liked it ; yet the memory came back to him in the deep , bitter taste of the grass , this time telling him that what he wanted , more than anything else , was to take Elena from her lover and bring her back  --  beautiful and black-haired for himself . Quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulled out two suitcases from a closet and opened them on his bed . He chose underwear , shirts , handkerchiefs , and socks . On the way he planned that he would run into a shop and buy Elena a necklace , a new wedding ring . He would buy himself a tie . From down the corridor he heard a banging and Eva 's voice that said , " Wake up , Birdie , wake up . There are a lot of things to do . We 're taking inventory , and Ilya wants to see you . " Alexei glanced at his watch , thinking that Birdie had slept long enough . He went on packing , elaborately folding his clothes , taking fresh pleasure in his skill . But when he descended the stairs half an hour later , he found his way to the front door barred by a carton of books , a samovar , the world globe from the den , and Arianne 's umbrella . Behind these , three large paintings stood lined up against a wall . Setting down his suitcases , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Katya and Eva leaned over the open drawers of the buffet , Katya with a pad and pencil in her hand . They were counting silver . Above them , where a picture of avocados always hung , was an empty space . Everything , Alexei thought , seemed odd . He sensed something -- some strange current in the air , some bewildering change that he could not identify . Fear and suspicion seized him . His pulse began to pound . " Twelve spoons , " Katya said , " leaf pattern . " " No , ten , " said Eva . His two daughters stopped when they noticed him . But Ilya and Birdie , who were playing cards at the dining-room table , did not look up even after he had entered and demanded , " What 's going on ? What 's going on ? " His fear grew stronger , became a kind of panic . Then suddenly he thought he understood : he had been duped . His children had been in on Elena 's plan from the very beginning ; all along they 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom . A false smile stretched across Alexei 's face  --  a wheedling , over-intimate expression so alien to him it cut his cheeks . " You might as well tell me . There 's no point to hiding it . Where has Elena gone ? " Eva strode over to him . It was then that he started to feel the other fear , the other terror . Eva lifted her face close to his and , looking down at her , he knew what she was going to say . More than ever before , he was aware of her extraordinary complexion , inherited from his own family . And indeed the skin on her face appeared so milky-white , so translucent , that for a moment he believed in the possibility of seeing right through her to some preferable object  --  such as bridges , even trees  --  but was stopped by the stubborn , owl-like challenge of her nearsighted eyes , by her brooding nose , by her chin as she said , " Mama has not run away . She is dead . She died six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his mouth opened in a cry of pain . " A ... ri . anne ! " Eva told him , " Arianne 's busy drinking . She 's drinking because , on top of other things , the house is too big . It 's too big for you alone . We 're closing it up . " H E FOUND ARIANNE in the den , sitting in the dim room with a bottle of Scotch.a bottle of bourbon , and an ice bucket at her side . Still disoriented and with no exact motive in mind , he tried out his grotesquely unconnected smile on her , but was relieved when she did not see it in the dark . She said , " Come sit down next to me , Papa , and have a drink . I 'm way ahead of you , I 've finished the bourbon . It was wonderful bourbon . First rate , really . Let me fix you a Scotch . " He drank from the glass she handed him , taking comfort from it and from her hoarse , warm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she asked him , " all those games of badminton we used to play ? Do you remember all those nights we ended up drinking brandy in the garden at two o'clock in the morning and singing ' 0 Tannenbaum ' and ' Auld Lang Syne ' ? Those are first-rate songs . I love those songs . " She poured them each another drink . But he would not touch his . Something was stuck in his mind , in his heart . He fought both to locate and to control it , and presently he said , " Arianne , I think . . . it occurs to me . - your mother died . " Through the slats in the venetian blinds he could see Eva carrying one of the large paintings down the front path . She loaded it into the cab of her camper . Alexei waited for Arianne to answer . But Arianne , as always unable to think of any but jovial things to say , stared straight ahead in her sorrow . ?         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
