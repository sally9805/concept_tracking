What the U.S. needed , Richard Nixon said again and again during his 1968 campaign , was " a new Attorney General . " When Bond Lawyer John Mitchell moved into the Justice Department after the election , he went all out to make good on Nixon 's implied promise that the country 's top legal officer would know how to use wiretaps to fight organized crime . Last week that promise , like so many others from the law-and-order Nixon Administration , collapsed dramatically . The Supreme Court ruled that a sizable chunk of Mitchell 's taps were improper and illegal . At one stroke , the decision wiped out nearly two years of dogged work by federal investigators , and imperiled at least 60 cases involving no fewer than 626 accused gamblers , narcotics dealers and other racketeers . <P> The devastating decision was handed down in a federal case against Dominic N. Giordano , a Baltimore drug dealer who was indicted in 1970 on narcotics charges . The Justices ruled 9-0 that a lower court had properly dismissed Giordano 's indictment because the evidence against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1968 Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act gave federal investigators vastly expanded authority to use taps-as long as they were personally approved by the Attorney General or a specially designated assistant . But dozens of authorizations , including those in the Giordano case , were simply initialed " JNM " by an obscure Mitchell aide named Sol Lindenbaum , or sometimes by Lindenbaum 's secretary . That irregularity , the court concluded , was no mere technicality . Congress plainly meant to " narrowly confine " the use of electronic eavesdropping , wrote Justice Byron White in the unanimous opinion . Thus Congress had been careful to require that " the mature judgment of a particular , responsible official " would be involved in any decision to tap . <P> How could the Attorney General have overlooked such a clearly stated legal responsibility ? Though Mitchell himself was saying nothing , others have not been so reticent . Aide Lindenbaum bluntly blames the foul-up on Mitchell 's overwhelming preoccupation with political concerns-particularly with promoting the Administration 's law-and-order image . As Lindenbaum has been telling it , Mitchell never bothered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sign wiretap requests ; he apparently wanted to sign them himself-the better to enhance his chosen political pose as a tough , sleeves-up crime fighter . So , at first , Lindenbaum would prepare the necessary papers , which Mitchell would hurriedly sign . After a while , Lindenbaum took to signing Mitchell 's initials on the tap requests when Mitchell was out of town - often without even discussing the request with his boss on the telephone . <P> The procedure was patently improper . <P> It clearly threatened the work of investigators in 22 federal anticrime " strike forces " around the nation ; yet it continued for 20 months between April 1970 and November 1971.
