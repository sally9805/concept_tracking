txt Watergate is changing the power structure in Washington ? Congress up : the President down . The shift is continuing parallel with the Watergate hearings , and nobody can guess how far it will go . After 40 years of erosion of congressional power the trend has ended , some argue , and a new relationship is in sight . Some even think America is in for a period of congressional domination like that after World War I. Others call the present situation tem-porary The new relationship is strikingly illustrated by two statements from President Nixon . At a March 16 press conference , Mr. Nixon flatly refused to allow his then White House counsel John W. Dean III to testify at the confirmation hearings of L. Patrick Gray III to the FBI . " I consider it my constitutional duty to defend the principle of separation of powers , " he declared , adding defiantly that he would welcome a Supreme Court test of executive privilege . Reporters wrote " constitutional crisis . " President backtracks But then came the full burst of Watergate revelations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the White House staff will appear voluntarily when requested by the ( Ervin ) committee , " he said Exit constitutional crisis . The situation , some note , shows the President seriously on the defensive . He has not had another press conference since March 15 and has decided to remain silent on Watergate during the present phase of the Ervin committee hearings . This has the disadvantage for the administration that TV coverage continues without a formal Nixon reply . Meanwhile , there is spreading concern over the economic situation . Prices continue to rise , though at a somewhat lower rate , and there is fear that a slowdown will follow the boom . Two other subjects were thought likely by some to produce the elusive constitutional crisis ? impoundment and the Cambodian war . It did n't happen Impoundment is the asserted right of the White House not to spend funds voted by Congress , or to divert them to other fields . // *New power structure // On Jan. 15 , Rep. Joe L. Evins ( D ) of Tennessee asserted that Mr. Nixon had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only $8.7 billions . Anyway it was a challenge . But the courts denied the authority of the White House in many fields to withhold funds , and the White House seemed to modify its chip-on-theshoulder attitude . Impoundment as an issue dimished . Next was Cambodia . The inconclusive election gave Mr. Nixon a huge majority but left Democrats in control of Congress : Senate 56-44 ; the House 240-192 , with vacancies . Many foresaw a clash over the Indo-China war with an increasingly ag- gressive peace , , group in Congress pitted against a grim White House that reinstituted bombing , Dec. 18-30 , in North Vietnam As Congress moved toward a confrontation , however , Mr. Nixon announced resumption of peace negotiations and hailed an agreement to end the war " Jan. 23 . Prisoners of war came home and Mr. Nixon hailed them That left Cambodia . Surely the constitutional crisis will come here , spectators said This was avoided by a last-minute compromise with Congress that permits Mr. Nixon to continue bombing until Aug. 15 . Peace negotiations continue . Meanwhile , Congress has asserted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now on . On the home front , as it affects Watergate , the situation has gone from bad to worse , from the administration 's standpoint . As to the future Congress seems to have lost its awe of the White House . It is trying to put its own fiscal house in order Its weakest point is its loose budget procedure .
