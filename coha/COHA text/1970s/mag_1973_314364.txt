His Air Force superiors , Fitzgerald claims , did not applaud his frankness before Congress . He was cut off from cost information about major weapons systems , an investigation of his private life was initiated , laudatory comments were excised from his record before it was turned over to Congress , and finally in January 1970 his position as Deputy for Management Systems was abolished . <P> Last week Fitzgerald 's misfortunes were finally reversed , when a civil service appeals examiner reinstated him , ruling that his dismissal was " improperly " labeled an economy move when it was in fact " purely personal . " In addition , Fitzgerald was awarded $130,000 in back pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close to paying for all that was done to me . " How will he feel back at the old job ? " I intend to go back and approach it with an open mind . Many of the people there are new . The people who hated me most are gone , " said Fitzgerald . " I have unfinished business in the Pentagon .
