txt Out in the U.S. countryside , they are selling a new kind of condominium , the " condo-campsite ' ? with no ceiling , no walls , no floors . The thousands of Americans investing in this type of land development are paying an average of $6,000 to $8,000 for a small lot in a large campground usually designed exclusively for owners of recreation vehicles . Many of these motorized campers live in large metropolitan cities and use their condominium-style campsites as a sort of vacation home . They say the concept is particularly attractive because it : ? Assures them year-round access to a comfortable campground . ? Cuts down significantly on the expensive mileage often required to reach traditional campsites . ? Solves the often-perplexing problem of finding a suitable and legal place to park recreation vehicles when not in use .

Critics say the " condo-campsite " is not a particularly attractive investment since few campgrounds are sold out , and unsold sites have a negative effect on the market . // *$6,000 for a campsite ? // Nonetheless , developers are optimistic about the future , and new variations of the condominium theme are being tried . Seasonal sites For instance , Outdoor Resorts will start selling " seasonal " campsites soon . Several parties will be " sold " the same site ? for use during different periods of the year . When not in actual use , managers of most condo-campgrounds rent campsites at the request of the owner for asmall percentage of the rental fee . Rent receipts help owners meet their maintenance fees .
