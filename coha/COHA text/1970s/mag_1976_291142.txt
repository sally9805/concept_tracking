Can leaders be identified at an early age , then nurtured and encouraged ? The question is very nearly unanswerable , since a combination of innate ability , early influences , later opportunity and sheer luck seems to make leadership a wholly unpredictable eruption . Nonetheless , one TIME task force explored the proposition that at an early age leaders come to feel separate , different from their peers . Members of the group spent part of one session recounting their own formative experiences . Excerpts : <P> BILL BRADLEY , New York Knicks basketball player : I came from a small town in Missouri of 3,000 people . My father was the local banker . So I do not qualify for the Abe Lincoln syndrome . Do I feel separate ? Yes . I did not identify with any of the institutions or with any of the groups I was placed in as a child . <P> RICHARD KNEIP , Governor of South Dakota : I would count myself separate from my family . I was one of nine children . My father started out as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not a loving kind of relationship then , but in the past ten years I could not have been closer to anyone than I was to my father . In his later years he mellowed . Earlier he was very anti-education . He threw me down the stairs of his office when I told him that I wanted to go to college . He thought it was a waste of time , unless you wanted to be a doctor or a lawyer . <P> JOSEPH MATTINA , New York state supreme court justice : I grew up in an Italian neighborhood and my father was a shoemaker . My parents were born in Sicily and they could not speak English so I went to school speaking Italian . I flunked kindergarten-the only thing I flunked in my academic career . It was something that stuck in my mind . When I went to high school , suddenly the separateness was very apparent . There were not too many Italians . You could not get into the clubs or the fraternities . There was an Irish Catholic church , and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MacDONALD , chairman , Navajo Tribal Council : I grew up in the middle of the Navajo reservation . There were no taxes , welfare or store , newspaper or anything , not even radio . Talk about separate . Up until I was seven and left the reservation , the only people in this world were Navajos . Respect for certain things was drilled into me . Also not to question those things which the elders have put together . When I left the reservation I did well because the basic thing that motivated me was respect for what was already accomplished . Today young people are beginning to question all kinds of norms . <P> BARBARA NEWELL , president , Wellesley College : My father was a college professor . He had dedicated 75 years of his life to social issues and reform and activism . The generation before him spent their lives in the same kind of thing . The issues of the world were served up at dinner . I did not have any sense of separatism . Actually , until I got out and did graduate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common for female economists to go out talking in public arenas about social change . Until that point it never occurred to me that my life was not absolutely common .
