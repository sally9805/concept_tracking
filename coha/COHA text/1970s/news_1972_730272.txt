txt E. Howard Hunt Jr. , the former Central Intelligence Agency official now sought by Federal agents in connection with last month 's raid on the Democratic National Committee here , was reliably reported today to have fled to Europe and possibly to be in Spain . This report came from persons close to Mr. Hunt as the Federal authorities said that a large force of Federal Bureau of InVestigation agents had been searching for the former White House consultant throughout the United States since early last week . At the same time , Spanish Embassy officials here said in weekend interviews that Mr. Hunt 's wife , Dorothy , long an employe of the embassy , had told them as late as the latter part of May that her husband was still Working for the White House . This appeared to contradict a White House statement shortly after the raid on the Democratic headquarters at the Watergate office building here that Mr. Hunt , whose name had been linked with the break-in at dawn of June 17 , completed his consultant status in the Presidential office on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Spanish Embassy , whose officials said that she had told them in May that " my husband works for the White House and he is away traveling so much that I hardly ever see him . " Because of the publicity surrounding Mr. Hunt in what was rapidly becoming a major political affair here , the Spanish Embassy decided to terminate her employment effective yesterday , with a month 's severance pay . She had been ern. ployed four hours a day translating documents and speeches from Spanish to English . Mr. Hunt , who played a key role in organizing the C.I.A . ' s abortive Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba in 1961 , was linked to the Watergate raid after the police found his name and home telephone number in the address books of two of the alleged raiders , both of them Cuban-born , when the group was arrested at the Democratic offices . Although Mr. Hunt spoke to F.B.I . agents three days after the Watergate raid , he refused , according to Federal officials , to answer any questions . Subsequently , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last 10 days his whereabouts have been unknown . Today , persons close to Mr. Hunt said they understood he had flown to Europe . They said he had " touched base " in Spain , but they were unable to say whether he still might be there . All the five persons arrested at ' the Watergate raid had ties with Mr. Hunt during the Bay of Pigs operation , most notably Bernard L. Barker , a Miami realtor , who was said to have acted as the C.I.A . ' s finance officer in the invasion preparations . In an interview with The New York Times last week , Mrs. Clara Barker , Mr. Barker 's wife , said that her husband and Mr. Hunt were business partners in recent ventures . The Federal authorities said last month that $5,300 in $100 bills found on the raiders at the time of their arrest and in their hotel rooms were part of a withdrawal of $89,000 made by Mr. Barker from a Miami bank in May . This amount was said to have been deposited the previous month in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Mexican bank . Mrs. Barker said that her husband and Mr. Hunt had been engaged together in business in Central America . Pistol in White House Federal agents reported last week that a walkie-talkie and an unloaded pistol were recently found in the drawer of the desk in the suite of offices Mr. Hunt occupied in the White House . The White House has not said whether Mr. Hunt had access to his office there after he ceased to be a part-time White House consultant . The White House has said that Mr. Hunt , who retired from the C.I.A . in 1970 , was hired as a part-time consultant in 1971 on the recommendation of Charles W. Colson , special counsel to the President . Mr. Colson and Mr. Hunt were reported by mutual friends to have been acquainted for some time . Both reportedly are associated with the Brown University Alumni Club here . Spanish Embassy officials reported that Mrs. Hunt left Washington on June 1 , with two of her children , on what was going to be her month-long annual vacation . They said she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but not Spain " this time . " However , Mrs. Hunt returned to the Spanish Embassy and resumed , work on June 20 , three days after the Watergate raid . She explained that the weather had been bad in Europe and , therefore , she had decided to shorten her vacation . Mr. Hunt vanished from sight the following day , but his wife continued to go to work at the embassy until last Frida however , as in past days , there was no answer to telephone calls at the Hunts ' suburban Maryland home . One of the reasons for the F.B.I . ' s renewed interest in Mr. Hunt is that the persons who raided the Watergate ' were equipped with two walkietalkies , similar to the set found at his White House office . Although the devices were said by the authorities to have used a frequency assigned by the Federal Communications Commission to the Republican National Committee , it was not known on what frequency the set in Mr. Hunt 's desk was operating . One of the persons arrested at the Watergate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . agent , had served as the security chief for both the Republican National Committee and the Committee to Re-Elect the President , He was dismissed immediately after the Watergate raid and John N. Mitchell , who resigned yesterday as the director of the Committee to ReElect the President , said at the time that he was undertaking his own investigation into the matter . Equipment found on the arrested persons included listening and transmitting devices and cameras suitable for microfilming files . In other developments in the Watergate case , at least one , and possibly more , persons were brought from Miami last lweek to testify before a special Federal grand jury here . Testifying before the grand jury last Tuesday was Miguel R. Suarez , who is Mr. Barker 's Miami attorney and his partner in some real estate ventures . The F.B.I . was also reported to have interrogated in Miami a large number of persons , mainly Cubans , whose names have come to the surface in the current investigation ,                @ @ @ @ @
