THE WAGER <P> Written by MARK MEDOFF <P> Directed by ANTHONY PERKINS <P> This is a pin wheel of a comedy , shooting off sparks of wit , menace and surprise at a fast clip . Two pairs of ill-assorted roommates are living in a high-rise apartment on a Northern California campus . There is Ward , a jock who scores as often off as on the field , sharing digs with Leeds , a malicious intellectual who can only win with wit . Right next door lives Ron , a microbiologist of genius , and his faithless wife Honor . When Ward boasts that he can seduce Honor , Leeds bets him that if he does so , Ron will kill Ward within 48 hours . The resulting anarchy smacks of both the Marx brothers and Sleuth and produces two good performances , from Kenneth Oilman as Ward and Kristoffer Tabori as Leeds . Mark Medoff , whose play When You Comin ' Back , Red Ryder ? was an off-Broadway success last season , has a rare talent for juxtaposing fear and fun . Though The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speed verbal games truly revealing of character and motive , this is his best play so far , and it seems to signal even better plays to come . <P> Gina Mallet
