A little-known centimillionaire gets rich by staying private <P> <P> Curtis Carlson , a freewheeling entrepreneur who made his first millions selling Gold Bond Stamps , has a gilt complex . He loves gold . The energetic conglomerateur controls the worldwide operations of his Minneapolis-based empire ( hotels , restaurants , discounting ) from offices reminiscent of that Bondian archvillain , Auric Goldfinger : his gold-embossed telephone , gold vinyl chair and gold-striped sofa are set off by the rich , warm shades of a gold-hued carpet . When Carlson 's Gold Bond Stamp operation was at its peak in the 1960s , its executives drove a fleet of company-owned gold Cadillacs . A gold-framed saying in one of his offices reflects Carlson 's buck-starts-here philosophy : " Lest you forget , our sole purpose here is to make money . However , let 's have fun while we are doing it . " <P> A robust Midwesterner of sturdy Nordic stock , the tall , silver-haired Carlson , 64 , keeps both his personal life and his business private , and he is barely known outside his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companies in ten groups without ever having sold a share of stock to the public , along the way amassing a fortune estimated at $100 million . Because his companies are private , they are not required to report sales or profits figures . But he has allowed TIME Correspondent Patricia Delaney a closer look at the far-flung activities of the Carlson Companies , Inc . <P> Combined revenues , he revealed , totaled $1.041 billion last year , up a remarkable 170% from 1975 . Now Carlson hopes to hit the $2 billion sales mark in 1982 . Carlson does not disclose profits because he plows everything back into the company and thus keeps taxes low . Says he : " Net profits are meaningless . Growth and cash flow mean everything . " <P> The most visible part of the Carlson empire is the Radisson Hotel Group , which last year generated revenues of $90 million . There are 19 hotels with a total of 7,139 rooms , and Carlson hopes to expand by 1,000 rooms a year . He opened a resort hotel a year ago in Scottsdale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Pyramids outside Cairo , will be finished by the end of 1979 . Farther afield , Carlson is negotiating with the Chinese to build a hotel in Peking . He has a particularly active period of growth planned for two recently acquired restaurant chains , TGI Friday 's and Country Kitchen . Carlson aims to increase the Victorian-style TGI Friday 's from the present 30 outlets to 55 by 1984 and add 100 outlets a year over the next five years to the 320-restaurant Country Kitchen chain .
