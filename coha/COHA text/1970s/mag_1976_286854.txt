SKY RIDERS <P> Directed by DOUGLAS HICKOX Screenplay by JACK DEWITT , STANLEY MANN and GARRY MICHAEL WHITE <P> It is hard to comprehend why it required three writers to do this screenplay , when any reasonably bright nine-year-old could have managed it . The story is the stuff of convention : get some innocents ( a mother and two children ) captured by some baddies ( in this case lunatic political terrorists ) and sequestered where they are rescue-proof by conventional means ( a deserted monastery on top of an isolated peak ) . The whole idea is to make an improbable - and cinematically novel-rescue gimmick a logical necessity , and in this the scriveners succeed . <P> How to snatch Mom ( Susannah York ) and the kids from their closely guarded aerie ? By hang glider , of course . Happily , a barnstorming group of gliding fools is playing just down the beach ( Greece is full of such folks in the summertime ) , and James Coburn is on hand to put two and two together and lead the night raid on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the place and , full moon or no , you really do n't want to be swooping around mountainous country in those fragile contraptions . Still , Coburn is a brave fellow , a smuggler by trade , and strongly motivated-the mother having once been his wife and the eldest child being his . He must take what turns out to be a crash course in handling the gliders , and that is funny . <P> Once he and his new friends launch themselves on their mission proper , it turns out to be well staged and photographed , the beauty of the gliders aloft or the suspenseful silence of their descent on the wicked ones is impossible to deny . The concluding shootout , in which the police and the army bumble up just in time to help , is also nicely handled , bloodshed and death being kept to a minimum instead of being dwelt upon in the modish manner . <P> You can safely take the kids to Sky Riders and have a nice , old-fashioned Saturday matinee kind of time yourself . The whole thing is nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ends up sort of special .
