txt EVERY CREEPING THING He was an agreeable fellow , a member of the " Banana Leisure " jogging club . Coyne leaned down from her horse to give him his final instructions : " You see that fence there ? Go through it and go straight on . Get on now . " " O.K. , right-o , " the runner replied . He trotted off , leaving a sweaty T-shirt tied to a stake in the middle of the starting area , as the scent article for the hounds . " He 's got no smell , " Coyne muttered dismally , when he was out of earshot . The whipper-in had the pack of hounds gathered together at a safe distance , and now Coyne went up to greet them . " Oh , we 've got the girlie , whirlie , pearlies ! " she exulted . " The big fat ladies and the little thin ladies ! " The hounds danced around her worshipfully . " Bloodhounds hunt , " Coyne called down to me , " because they like you . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have their fun , to play . They 'll tell you to bugger off if you use the whip on them . Whereas the foxhound is tough as old boots . " As we waited for the runner to make the most of his head start , the chairman and founder of the hunt , a florid , overweight fellow named Major William Stringer , recollected his first efforts with bloodhound hunting as a British Army officer stationed in West Germany in the 1960s . " We used soldiers as runners , " he said . " Volunteers . With a slight bit of pressure . " He recalled in particular a Private Smith who volunteered on a day when a general from the German army joined the field . The general , said Stringer , " thought it was great hunting a human , absolutely perfect . " The unfortunate Private Smith apparently felt otherwise . But he set off , and after a reasonable interval , the hounds went after him , with the field of hunters behind . As the thunderous bellowing of the pack drew closer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on , " Stringer said , " I suddenly noticed that the fences were getting higher , we were going over wires and all , and I thought , Where is this man Smith going ? ' And then I thought 60 Good Scents we were on to deer . Some of the horses were falling out , we were going so fast . I started looking for gaps and gates to ' and I was thinking , My God , when I catch this bloody man Smith I 'll give him hell . ' Finally , I came up and there he was , hiding behind a tree . I was just about to put him in the brig , when the general came up and said , Nobody in the world can hunt as well as we did today . ' So of course I said , Well done , Smith . ' " As Major Stringer finished his story , Ruth Coyne announced that time was up for the Banana Leisure runner . The whip led the hounds toward the starting point , and they were off in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scent article , their baying inaudible above the roar of the motorway . " Going like the clappers , " Coyne declared with satisfaction , and then she galloped off , with her field of twenty riders in pursuit . Major Stringer , who no longer rides , and various other friends and family followed the hunt by car , sometimes circling ahead of the pack . The frantic hounds ran directly where the runner had gone , or on a parallel course a few feet away where the wind had caused his scent trail to drift . Delilah and the fat old ladies scrambled under blackthorn hedges , burst through loose stone walls , leaped over obstacles with their loose flesh dancing around them like schoolgirls ' skirts . As the scent got warmer , they raced faster and bellowed more wildly . Followers of the hunt describe this as " beautiful music . " But one of the runners told me it was an " eerie , a most unearthly sound . " During the slower interludes , the talk among the hunt followers turned to the Labour Party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , two hundred protesters had showed up a few nights before at a hunt ball in Manchester , chanting " Rich bastards ! " and spitting on women as they arrived in their evening gowns . Almost everyone in the Windsor Forest Hunt started out in foxhunting , and many still participate , so they tended , as a matter of form , to denounce animal rights protesters . // One of them worried that traditionalists might " think we 're cashing in as a soft alternative to foxhunting . " Still , everyone was aware that squeamishness and unrest about blood sports are increasing , and no one asked indiscreet questions about anyone else 's lily-livered sympathies . Queen Elizabeth herself decided years ago to abstain from the foxhunt . But hunting with bloodhounds has earned her approval . On one occasion , the Windsor Forest Hunt met by invitation in the royal park surrounding Windsor Castle and she joined several members of the royal family in the pursuit ( the runners presumably being drafted from the ranks of the tabloid press ) . Between the second and third run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rest in a field when we suddenly heard the snap-crackle-pop of machine gun fire . It developed that amateur war games were taking place in a woods nearby . Candy-canestriped plastic police tape defined the battle area , where men and women dressed in gas masks and camouflage darted about , enjoying the outdoors and shooting one another . A judge in a neon green jumpsuit presided . The members of the bloodhound hunt surveyed this extraordinary scene in wonder . Just then , a team of hunt saboteurs showed up at the end of the field to block the gate with their bodies in defense of animal rights . One of the more diplomatic members of the hunt gently explained that this pack consisted of bloodhounds ; it was n't actually hunting foxes , but . . . well ... human beings . The hunt saboteurs contemplated this news , and after a moment , as if to say , " Well , that 's alright , then , " they allowed the gate to be swung open . The hunt proceeded to chase its final victim of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not kill anything that day or any other . The English people , while still known to dote on dogs , take a strong line against tearing the local citizenry to pieces . Indeed , the hunters would have a hard time getting their hounds to bite . Whatever fierceness bloodhounds may once have possessed has been bred out of them . Modern blood-62 Good Scents hounds are unimaginably gentle , affectionate with children , and tolerant even of inquisitive journalists measuring the twentyeight-to thirty-inch span of their ears . Bloodhound fanciers tend nowadays to deny that fierceness was ever a bloodhound trait . When the hounds of the Windsor Forest Hunt caught up with their quarry , they licked him . " When the runner is found , " writes one follower of the hunt , " he is not torn to pieces , but greeted by dozens of wet tongues ! A wonderful sight ! " The hunt ended not in blood but in slobber . But the breed 's hellhound image endures , and back in the United States , many bloodhound owners blame Harriet Beecher Stowe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fearsome connotation , " Catherine Brey and Len Reed write in The Complete Bloodhound , " that to this day many people believe he is a savage and dangerous animal . " Another author complains that on hearing the word " bloodhound , " " nine people out of ten conjure up a tearful scene of poor Liza . . . frantically scrambling across the ice floes with a pack of vicious , red-eyed , froth-drooling beasts baying sadistically at her heels . " As it happens , these authors are wrong to malign Stowe . Bloodhounds did , of course , chase Liza in the 1927 movie of Uncle Tom 's Cabin and in innumerable nineteenth-century stage productions . They became such a standby that a humorist exiting one unfortunate staging remarked , " The dogs was good , but they lacked support . " But Stowe 's version of Liza 's crossing does not include any dogs at all , and her book never once mentions bloodhounds. the real problem for the bloodhound is not , after all , its appearnce or its name or Harriet Beecher Stowe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human beings are ill-equipped to understand .
