.. is terrific . Lying around in the sun on a tropical island may be O.K. for a while , but by and large it is more fun to be up and doing something , and surely the most fun is to be doing something well , whether it be hitting a sand wedge , casting to a bonefish , throwing up a lob  --  or just climbing a coconut palm .

If these are for you , the instructors on this and the following pages and the new fashions just may be for you , too // School For Salts , Old and New // Steve Colgate 's classroom is Elizabeth Harbor , off Great Exuma Island , 130 miles southeast of Nassau in the Bahamas .

Colgate ( right , raising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who runs the Offshore Sailing School , Ltd. for beginners and directs Sailing Symposiums Bahamas Race Weeks , a course for experts . His Offshore course , reputed to be the best such program there is , consists of a solid week of basic seamanship aboard one of nine So-lings . Three instructors manage to cram everything you ever wanted to know about sailing into 20 hours of instruction followed by two days of solo practice . The Symposiums schedule involves six half-day sessions of racing aboard the Solings , which are equipped with the latest in racing gear . Sailors advanced enough to have any technique to sharpen are coached by experts on an Olympic-style course ; points that can not be made at sea from the instructor 's boat to the student 's ( through a bullhorn ) are thrashed out at chalk talks in evening sessions . Tactics and techniques are taught by Colgate and such guest experts as well-known racers Bruce Goldsmith , Peter Barrett , Dick Stearns and John Marshall .

We are mountain divers , because Bonaire is a mountain in the sea . " So says scuba expert Don Stewart of the small island situated in the Netherlands Antilles , where the water has been called the cleanest and clearest in the world . White sand beaches stretch from a calm crystalline bay on the lee side to the small , beautifully kept Hotel Bonaire and Stewart 's Aquaventure facilities adjacent to it . The island 's northern beaches are rugged with coral rock and the white water of the surf , and between the two extremes lies an extraordinarily variegated landscape : rolling acres of green cactus fields , Dutch colonial villages of small pristine houses such as those at right and majestic solar-salt pyramids , products of the Antilles Salt Company , reflected in the pink-and-green waters of the panning fields . // Stewart ( below , right ) instructs from an extensive file of his own charts and tables dealing with diving theory , general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expenditure , decompression and embolism . Before each dive he draws the coral formations and canyons his students will visit ; occasionally he even sculpts the diving site in plastic clay . Pupils are made to wear their equipment continuously so they will be thoroughly familiar with it , and he nags them a lot . " I wo n't do it for you , " he says , " because if I do , you wo n't learn , but I will be working with you the whole time . " He teaches with an air of insouciance , but the instruction is solid ; his method could be compared , perhaps , with the way he wears his o ring . A spare o ring is a necessary part of any diver 's equipment , and Stewart wears his dangling from his pierced right ear . // Way to Go // To get to George Town there are direct , scheduled flights from Miami or Nassau . The Out Island Inn has 88 rooms with terraces or balconies facing the water , plus a pool , tennis courts and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service at the hotel rents Flying Scots and Sun-fish , scuba and snorkel equipment and water skis and Whalers with outboard motors for skiing or fishing ( bonefishing on the Great Exuma Flats is excellent ) .
