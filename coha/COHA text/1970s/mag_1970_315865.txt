RICHARD NIXON 'S strategy of Vietnamization faces a new period of peril and testing . The President has declared that he will have ended active U.S. participation in the war by Election Day 1972 ; indeed , public opinion in the U.S. leaves him no alternative if he is to survive politically . The catch is that as fewer and fewer American soldiers remain , they become more and more vulnerable-as does the survival of South Viet Nam . <P> The U.S. has not spelled it out officially , but it is clear enough what the President is up to with the recent blitz of air operations against North Viet Nam and the implicit threat of more . U.S. troops have been coming out of Viet Nam at the rate of about 12,500 a month . By mid-1971 , according to public pronouncements by both Defense Secretary Melvin Laird and Secretary of State William Rogers , nearly all U.S. troops will be out of combat . North Vietnamese infiltration into the South totaled 50,000 men in the first seven months of 1970 , according to the U.S. command @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Viet Nam , <P> Laos and Cambodia at an estimated rate of 12,000 monthly . <P> With the North Vietnamese evidently going in as fast as the Americans are clearing out , a new enemy offensive could catch the U.S. off balance ; in any case , the South Vietnamese will have to bear the brunt of any such concerted attack . Predictions of a big enemy offensive bloom perennially at this time of year , though none has taken place since Tet of 1968 . Now intelligence experts point to the enemy 's buildup of men and materiel and expect a major offensive early in 1971 . The U.S. air attacks are meant to blunt that offensive before it comes . There is every reason to believe that what is already known in Washington jargon as " periodic re-escalation ' ' will continue to cover the American exodus . Like the invasion of Cambodia , the air assaults are designed to buy enough time to make Vietnamization work . <P> Stretched Limits . The U.S. has been emitting a concentrated barrage of warnings to Hanoi to desist from launching an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daring raid on the Son Tay P.O.W. camp near Hanoi showed that the U.S. could mount a landing deep in North Viet Nam with near impunity . The bombing attacks the same night , involving some 250 U.S. jets , went beyond North Vietnamese antiaircraft defenses to include large concentrations of troops and supplies massed just inside North Viet Nam near the Laotian border . Early last week a lone U.S. F-105 fighter-bomber attacked an antiaircraft-missile base in North Viet Nam . To justify the pre-emptive strike , the Pentagon came up with still another coinage in the air-war vocabulary : the pilot had exercised " the inherent right of self-defense , " even though he had not been fired upon .
