CORIOLANUS by William Shakespeare <P> The British lion may be muted , but Shakespeare still roars . His voice thunders and echoes through the Royal Shakespeare Company 's production of Coriolanus at London 's Aldwych Theater . The play takes place on two fronts , the field of battle and the jugular terrain of class war . <P> Caius Marcius ( Alan Howard ) has won the added name of Coriolanus by defeating the Volscians at Corioli . He is a Roman of boundless valor and steely pride . The patricians put him up for consul of Rome and the plebeians grudgingly accede , though Coriolanus refuses to do any political truckling to secure their favor . Furious at his open contempt , the plebs rescind their approval and have him banished from the city . <P> His parting speech to them captures the full flavor of the man : <P> <P> You common cry of curs , whose <P> breath I hate <P> As reek o ' th ' rotten fens , whose <P> loves I prize <P> As the dead carcasses of unburied <P> men <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! <P> <P> Joining the Volscian commander Aufidius ( Julian Glover ) , Coriolanus leads an army toward Rome , determined to burn the city . Only the heart-wrenching plea of his mother Volumnia ( Maxine Audley ) deters him , after which Aufidius slays him . <P> Ranked with the leading young British classical actors , Alan Howard plays the title role with hurricane force . While his vocal range is narrow , his delivery of the lines is imperious in tone and cloudless in clarity . Heroic in bearing , he also conveys a sensual relish in the blood sport of war . Best of all , he tempers Coriolanus ' abrasive arrogance by showing the soldier 's moral consistency . After his mother has urged him to placate the plebs , he counters : <P> <P> Why did you wish me milder ? <P> Would you have me <P> False to my nature ? Rather say , I <P> play <P> The man I am . <P> <P> Only in the climactic maternal confrontation , which should be unbearably tender , does Howard falter . Tears wet his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Perhaps this is because Audley 's Volumnia is like a stage mother who has pushed her son into the limelight , not nurtured him for later glory . <P> The production is a stunner . Battles are stylized and understated ; only Coriolanus ' sword arm is crimsoned with gore . <P> The dominant color is black , with soldiers in leather , plebs in street clothes , patricians in velvet ankle-length robes . The stage is blocked out like those tunnel run ways through which cattle are prodded to slaughter . Terry Hands ' hot-spirited direction makes 3 hours pass like one , a daunting feat well worth emulation by directors who dawdle over the Bard till he turns tepid . <P> - T.E .
