HELP ! The kittens are climbing the Christmas tree ! " The tree sways dangerously in the suburban Baltimore apartment ; ornaments fly in all directions . Giggling ecstatically as they call to their mother , Andrea Rander , the girls-Lysa , 12 , and Page , 6-streak across the living room and pluck the month-old kittens , Gamma , Alpha and Fluffy , from their perches in the tree . Then the evening news flashes on the TV screen . Andrea and her daughters lock into place , as if in pantomime of a film freeze frame . Henry Kissinger has met again in Paris with his North Vietnamese counterpart Le Due Tho . <P> " What does it mean , Mommy ? " <P> Page asks . " Is it good ? " Replies Andrea Rander : " Time for bed . " Later , hearing the glum report from Henry Kissinger in Washington , Andrea sighs : " Oh , no ! Here we go again . That 's what they 've been saying for the last four years . " Then she composes herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We 'll just keep hoping and hoping . " <P> Last week 's scene in the Rander home , which was visited by TIME Correspondent Arthur White , was probably similar to hundreds of others across the country . With an anguished eye toward the stalled Paris peace talks , the families of 554 U.S. prisoners of war in Indochina , as well as the 1,273 other servicemen listed as missing , have resigned themselves to another sad , acephalous Christmas . <P> The Randers wait in mingled hope and dread for word of Sergeant First Class Donald Rander of Army Intelligence , captured at Hue on Feb. 1 , 1968 . Shortly thereafter two fellow soldiers who escaped reported that he had been wounded in the arm but was alive in a Viet Cong prison camp in South Viet Nam . There has been no word from Rander in five years . So his women wait , worry and try to pretend that there is holly in their hearts . <P> Mrs. Rander , 34 , a lovely , petite black woman who met and married Donald , now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , tucks Page in and resumes addressing Christmas cards-a color photo of herself and the children . One of them goes to President and Mrs. Richard Nixon . " I got one from them last year , " Andrea explains . " I thought I 'd beat them to it this year . " <P> Desperate Pleas . On the back of the card she writes : " President Nixon , the smiles on our faces do n't represent happiness or joy during the Advent season . This Christmas marks our sixth without Donald J. Rander , a prisoner of war in South Viet Nam . May you and your family have a happy holiday season . Andrea , Lysa and Page Rander . " Too cryptic for comfort , perhaps , but as Mrs. Rander notes : " I was n't trying to be sarcastic . I just wanted to get the point across . " She also remarks that she voted for Nixon this year , though other blacks tried to talk her out of it . She clings precariously to her belief that Nixon is doing his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wives and parents who share her plight , Mrs. Rander has endured years of frustrated effort in her husband 's behalf . Three years ago , at Nixon 's invitation , she went to Washington with other P.O.W. wives to discuss what the President termed " the distressing situation of our captured and missing servicemen . " Since then both she and her daughters have exchanged letters with the White House , desperate pleas answered with slender hopes .
