txt SAN FRANCISCO ? The setting is idyllic : 2,700 acres of redwood trees together ' with good food and wine and cabins a little too comfortable to be called rustic . The name is Bohemian Grove , and during the last two weeks of July for the last 99 years it has attracted many of the United States ' most powerful men . Located 65 miles north of San Francisco along the meandering Russian River , the Grove is a restricted and secluded haven where Big Shots go to camp . AMONG THE political feeders and captains of industry who have attended the annual encampments  --  either as members or guests  --  are former Presidents Hoover , Eisenhower , Nixon , and . Ford ; also Earl Warren , Henry Kissinger , Robert Kennedy , Leonard Firestone , Edgar Kaiser Sr. of Kaiser Industries , and former RCA chairman David Sarnoff . This year , as the club prepares to celebrate its 100th anniversary , Bohemian Grove remains something of an enigma despite a membership list that comprises the very elite and best known of " who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merely a social club , a place to which important men can journey for a brief time to forget the troubles of the universe and devote full attention to matters of art and leisure . THE EMPHASIS on relaxation is reflected in the club 's motto , " Weaving Spiders , Come Not Here , " a not-so-subtle reminder that talk of politics and business is considered poor form , The message is further conveyed during tile first of three major stage events that are enacted at the Grove each summer , at a cost upwards of $30,000 each . The production , called " Cremation of Care , " is a strange ritualistic ceremony involving pearly a hundred participants . It concludes with the symbolic burning in effigy of a wooden skeleton in a coffin that represents the end of the cares of the world , . It is a high honor to be asked to participate in one of these shows , . Last year , two of the bit actors were Casper Weinberger , former secretary of health , // Men will be boys ? even the rich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , president of the Bank of America , the nation 's largest . In past years , stage hands have included the likes . of Nelson Rockefeller and Henry Ford H. EVERY EFFORT is made to ensure privacy and tranquility during the encampment . There is only one telephone line and most members remain totally isolated from the outside world during ? their visits , which range from a week ? end to the full two weeks . " I do n't know anyone who comes here to conduct business , " said Bohemian Grove 's current president , W. Farmer Fuller , a retired executive with Pittsburgh Plate Glass . During a brief interview , ? Fuller declined to answer any detailed ' , questions regarding the club 's activities or its membership of 2,000 . This Is in keeping with a Grove tradition of avoiding publicity . EVEN INDIVIDUAL members are reluctant to talk publicly . Sen.

Some members and those familiar with its workings were , however , willing to talk off the record . " Really , it 's just a big overgrown Boy Scout camp , " is how one of them described it . INDEED , TILE skits , the campfire camaraderie , and even the occasional prank are reminiscent of ' a giant Scout jamboree .. In 1971 , the club was embarrassed.by a sex scandal of sorts . , Apparently , a small number of members had gone " over the river " into a nearby town and taken up with some ladies of the evening who had been operating out. , of a local saloon . The sheriff was tipped off and for a while it looked as if there would be a sensational prostitution trial until the case was tossed out on a technicality .

Much'time is spent in activities organized within the individual camps ; there are 127 of them and each has its own sleeping cabins mid dining rooms , EVERY CAMP has Its Individual reputation and traditions . One is known for the gin fizz breakfast it hosts each year ; another for a dog-eared and hopelessly Archaic collection of erotica . Some camps are regarded as more elite than others .
