THE TALK , OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment A a S rule , a nonentity can be defined as someone who never reads about himself in the Times , and the hierarchic assumptions that underlie the choice of news fit to print rose to the surface a couple of weeks ago in a Times roundup of local political items , in which it was appar  --  ently deemed necessary to mention two people who were felt , at the same time , to be not worth mentioning . The di  --  lemma was solved this way : " Two ob  --  scure New York City Democrats filed objections at Albany with Secretary of State John P. Lomenzo to the residen  --  cy qualification of Mr. Goldberg to run for Governor . " Ve checked with the News , whose coverage of local politics is not so snooty . " The objections were filed , " according to the News , " by Dor  --  othy Dwire of Manhattan , a former Westchester district leader , and Nicho  --  las J. Miglino , a member of the North @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " is a Swedish word meaning , roughly , a champion of the people against the machinations of bureaucrats . It is a concept that has drifted around in United States politics for several years now without catching on , except in Hawaii , which adopted an Ombudsman Act in 1967 , and among certain lowly insurgent Democrats in New York City , who use the term to distinguish their intentions from those of regular Democrats , also known as " bosses " or " tools of the bosses . " Earli  --  er this month , perhaps in an effort to blur that distinction , the possibilities of the word were tested at a higher level . " Goldberg Envisions Role of Gov  --  governor as That of an Ombudsman " was the catchy headline in the Times . There is no evidence so far of the power of the word to enchant New York voters at any level , and it is doubtful whether it ought to he applied to the governorship , an office with a royalist patina that is fundamental to the adversary system New York voters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Manhattan , regulars versus reformers , the mayor of New York City versus the autocrat of Albany ( except maybe in an election year ) . T ? VO other recent stories in the Times incidentally illustrate the diversity of euphemism . The first was a report , on April 14th , of the transfer of a prisoner to the Tombs from the Fed  --  eral House of Detention , where , it was said , he had been caught sawing at the bars of his cell . It was a minor story , in which the reluctance of officials to com  --  ment on the episode was supplemented with random facts , but it was redeemed by the single direct quote : " ' We felt he was an escape-conscious individual , ' said an official of the federal jail , which is at West Street and West Eleventh Street , under the West Side Highway . " A splendid sample of constabulary dis  --  cretion , which , deliberately or not , en  --  hances the dignity of the prisoner . A series of headlines and subheads on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instinct for bland  --  ness can work the opposite way : Page 1 : " Cambodian Events Worry Key U.S. Aides in Saigon . " Page 5 : " Cambodia Events Worry U.S. Aides . " " Reports Add Pessimism . " " Slayings Pose Difficulties . " " Worry , " " pessimism , " " difficul  --  ties , " " events , " " reports , " " slayings " ? the slaughter of hundreds of obscure Vietnamese men , women , and children by Cambodian soldiers , that is to say . Esaten INthe Grand Ballroom of the Hotel Diplomat the other afternoon , five hundred couples , nearly all of them white , nearly all of them in early mid  --  dle age , sat cross-legged on a dirty red rug listening to the amplified words of a large gray-haired woman in a large green dress . " Let the awareness of the last few minutes settle out , " she said . " Moment by moment , our contact is rich and full and all . Think about right now , right now , now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the energy be  --  tween you . Play with the space between you . Sometimes hugging is a cop-out . " That day , the function rooms of the Hotel Diplomat , on West Forty-third Street , which are usually given over to business and political meetings of the less opulent sort , were given over to discus  --  sions , demonstrations , and " experimen  --  tal sessions " of the Esalen Institute , the West Coast organization that seeks to connect people who feel disconnected from themselves and other people . The woman in the green dress who conduct  --  ed the first session we attended  --  In  --  creasing Communication for Couples  --  was Miss Betty Fuller , and she seemed to know well how to work with her au  --  dience . " Find another couple , " she said . " Do n't use words . Simply get to know each other . There is room for some cou  --  ples on the stage . " Four couples went up on the stage . One young man in a striped shirt went up on the stage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where Dr. Ralph Metzner , Ph.D. , and Dr. John Lilly , M.D. , were con  --  ducting a lecture-demonstration session entitled Voyaging in Inner Space and Maps of Consciousness . When we ar  --  rived , the Executive Room was crowd  --  ed , and we stood in the hack , near a sign that announced the availability of box lunches in the Crystal Room . A tape was being played very loud , repeat  --  ing some overlapping messages again and again . " The body and the mind , there are no limits " was one message . " The body imposes definite limits " was another . " In the mind there are no limits " was a third . After a while that seemed a very long while , the tape stopped . " That was five minutes , " Dr. Lilly said . " Would anyone like to yol  --  imtecr what that did to them There was silence for a moment . " I found it hat d to breathe , " said one young man . " I found the possibility of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hack to the Grand Ball  --  room , where Miss Fuller 's session was ending and a No Host Cocktail Party was beginning . Miss Fuller was sitting on the edge of the stage next to some gladiolas , swinging her legs easily . Groups of people sat on the floor with  --  out awkwardness and drank expensive drinks from plastic cups . ( At a No Host Cocktail Party , the liquor is not free . ? Ve talked with one man who said that he thought the Esalen approach was " very suspect . " The other people we talked with were lighthearted and un  --  embarrassed and pleasantly aware that they were lighthearted and unembar  --  rassed . These people all seemed to he well educated . They talked about how crowded the sessions were and how hard it was to get a drink , and they tried to estimate how much money the people running the three-day Esalen session were making . They decided that since the sessions were crowded and since a three-day ticket cost seventy-five dol  --  lars , it must he a lot . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made their profit estimates in a casual , uncon  --  cerned way . In the same easy tone , they discussed more personal things . " I 'm coming to grips with my need for love and support , " said a middle-aged woman in a tailored suit . " I think that I 'm threatened by too much support , " said a younger woman . " I mean , it tires me . " We talked for a while with a young man who was lying on his back on the floor with his head resting on his hands . " I 'm into mind things right now , " he said at one point " I 'll probably talk a lot less from now on . " One Hundred and One THE day of the recent " Salad Casals " concert , Pablo Casals spent much of the morning conducting one hundred other cellists in a rehearsal of his Sardana for Cello Orchestra . Last week , we praised the concert , and the Sardana as well , and this week we would like to praise the rehearsal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sound that is alto  --  gether wonderful . It is reflective , pur  --  poseful , and beneficent , and listening to it is a little like listening to a swarm of giant bumblebees . The rehearsal was held in Carnegie Hall , and we arrived at the stage door a few minutes before the Maestro , joining a small group of people who wire awaiting his arrival and marvel  --  ling at his powers . " He 's ninety - three , " said one man , " and his hand shakes until his bow hits the strings . But then he is masterly . And he has the eyes of a man of thirty-five . " " He 's ninety-three , " said another , " and a few months ago he had a kidney stone re  --  moved . But this year he will play fifty-One concerts in Puerto Rico , Israel , Vienna , and Marlboro , Vermont , and still more bookings are possih1c . " A newsman from Madrid said , " We all wish we had his ears , his physique , and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Tait s , said , " He 's ninety-bloody-three ! " The Maestro arrived , and Mr. Schonberg , who wears a cumbinatinn watch and stopwatch on his wrist , so that he can time performances accu  --  rately , announced that it was five to eleven . The Maestro entered the hall , and the hundred other cellists , who were already at work , rose and tapped their stands with their howl . A small audience , which consisted of a hundred cello cases and about a hundred peo  --  ple , among them Princess Irene of Greece , also applauded . Casals said , " I am very , very thankful , thankful , thankful . " Casals was handed a small , collaps ible metal baton , which looked like the aerial of a transistor radio , and the rehearsal began . We sat in a front-row seat , right behind the Maestro and right next to Mr Schonberg . Mr. Schonberg had a score of the Sardana , and he kindly offered to share it with us . Casals be gan the rehearsal by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cellists , who lis tened alertly . The cellists were a fine , varied assort ment of men and women , kids and old-timers , from all parts of the world . Di rectly in front of Casals was a young man with a peace decal on the tailpiece of his cello . The cellists began to play , but Casals stopped them almost immediately and scolded them . " Do n't he lazy , " he said . " Give it character . It has no ener gy . " He sang it the was he wanted to hear it , and they played it again , and this time you could see the rosin THE NEW YORKER dust fly as their bows hit the strings . The re  --  hearsal was really a master class , even though the cellists were just about as good as they come , and when  --  ever Casals stopped them to make a point , he ended his lecture with an invocation . " Beautiful sound , beau  --  tiful music , " he would say as he gave an up  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whisper to us . " He 's going to unblock ' em if it kills ' em , " he said . " Fifty years ago , there was no problem , but playing today is sn repressed . That 's why he has to keep telling them , ' Do n't play notes . Play music . ' " The cellists began to make beautiful sounds and play beautiful mu sic , and for a while it sounded as though Casals were playing a hundred cellos himself . Eventually , he called a halt . " Do you need a little rest ' " he asked . The cellist with the peace decal grinned , and Casals looked at him and made a growly noise like an arpeggio on a cello . The cellist Looked at Casals and played a growly arpeggio on his cello , and they both laughed . The re  --  hearsal was over . Earth Day Earth Day began , the weather was warm and sunny . The sky was a smoky blue . Between noon and 2 P.1+.1. , Fifth Avenue was dosed to cars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precisely at noon a great many people , including Mayor Lindsay , Mrs. Lindsay , and a large group of young singers and instrumen  --  talists called The Voices of East Har  --  lem , started a walk down the Avenue from Fifty-ninth to Fourteenth . The Lindsays were surrounded by men with cameras and microphones . The Avenue became very crowded . Hundreds of people , and finally thousands , followed the Mayor as he made his way down  --  town . A few people walked uptown . It was a well-dressed , middle-class , al  --  most completely white crowd . The Mayor set a fast pace . He was tanned , and he and Mrs. Lindsay appeared to he in high spirits . They smiled and waved and answered questions . A Girl Scout handed him a daisy . A hippie gave him the V sign , and he returned it . One reporter asked the Mayor if all this could happen again . " I do n't know , " the Mayor said . Mrs. Lindsay quickly added , " Every three weeks . " B y @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to  --  gether , in front of the Public Library , at Forty-second Street . There were lots of flowers  --  real and manufac  --  tured . Most of the real ones belonged to the younger people  --  in their hands , in their pocketbooks , in their hair , in their pockets . Many of the older people had paper flowers in their lapels . Other paper flowers were tied to police bar  --  ricades . In an enclosure where some speakers were going to sit , paper flow  --  ers were hanging from a row of four empty chairs . In the enclosure , too , a lectern had an enormous paper sun  --  flower hanging over the front . The Manhattan School of Music Brass En  --  semble  --  five trumpets , four horns , four trombones , and a tuba , conducted by Cecil Collins  --  appeared on the Li  --  brary steps and played Gordon Jacob 's Interludes for Trumpets and Trom  --  bones from " Music for a Festival . " At about twelve-twenty , four speak  --  ers arrived and sat down in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writer named Roger Cams , stood right up again and walked to the lectern . He said that people should all he concerned " that the oceans may have no more than ten years to live before they die , that Americans despoil the ocean more than all the people of all the other lands combined , that we are the most waste  --  ful people on earth , and that if an air inversion should hit New York City more than ten thousand people could drop dead in a day . " Mr. Camas then introduced the sec  --  ond speaker , the critic Alfred Kazin , as an admirer of Walt Whitman and the author of " Walker in the City . " " If this is possible in New York , " Mr. Kazin said , looking around at the crowd , " then many other things are possible . New York has more of every  --  thing  --  not only more dirt and more garhage but also more brilliance and more resourcefulness . We are the most American of cities and the most ex  --  citing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and our streets , and there  --  fore it is worthwhile and fitting that we should come together like this and celebrate the city . " Thene was loud applause . The next speaker was the novelist Kurt Vol-inept , Jr . " It is not often that a total pessimist is asked to speak in the spring , " he said . " Here we are again , the peaceful demonstrators  --  mostly young and mostly white . Good luck to us , for I do n't know what sport  --  ing event the President may he watch  --  ing at the moment . He said the other day that the United States has never lost a war and he did not want to be the first President to lose a war . Well , he may be the first President to lose a whole planet . " He sat down , to loud applause . Next came the novelist and critic Marya Mannes , who spoke in a low-keyed , ironic tone and concluded by saying , " Lords of Affluence and Ava  --  rice , Holy Creators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infinite generosity of the Gross National Prod  --  uct with Gross National Pollution ... . May we now expiate these massive crimes by repudiating you  --  and by re  --  storing the beauty of life on earth be  --  fore its death claims us A. Amen and hallelujah . " She sat down , and again the applause was loud . At that point , Mayor Lindsay , mak  --  ing a brief stop on his way downtown , squeezed through the crowd and walked to the lectern . He observed that he did n't feel he could add to what the writers had just said , and continued , " I simply want to thank New Yorkers for the love of the city which they have displayed . And I hope a little of today will stay with us for the rest of our lives . " Then the Mayor , his arms folded , leaned against a police barri  --  cade inside the enclosure and listened as The Voices of East Harlem sang " Shake a Life . " IN the middle and upper Forties , de  --  spite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many people were still walking on its sidewalks . Wondering if they had a different atti  --  tude toward Earth Day from those out in the street , a reporter asked a number of men in business suits why they were still walking on the sidewalks . Most of them answered by saying something like " Habit , I guess , " but several said it was because they were going some  --  where . One man said , " I 'm walking on the sidewalk because I 'm going to a lunch date . I 've got a destination . " IN the close of the Episcopal Ca  --  thedral of St. John the Divine , the Right Reverend Paul Moore , Jr. , who has just been elected Bishop Coad  --  jutor of New York , addressed two hundred schoolboys from an outdoor pulpit . The pulpit had balloons tied to it , and Bishop Moore asked everyone to join him in a song . The song was : Happy Earth Day to you ! Happy Earth Day to you ! Happy Earth Day , dear Cathedral ! Happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crim  --  son cassock , with a red-and-white en ? amelled pectoral cross designed for him by the Sub-Dean of the Cathedral Church , the Reverend Canon Edward N. West . Bishop Moore told the boys a parable , which went like this : " This is a fish story , a bigger fish story than any you have heard . No , not Jonah and the whale . Paul and the whale . When I was twelve , I went fishing for tuna off Ipswich , Massachusetts . We did n't have much luck , and I was feeling lazy and queasy when suddenly the captain cried , ' Thar she blows ! ' Half a mile away , a school of whales had appeared . The captain was very excited . ' We got ta harpoon one of those whales , ' he said , and he insisted I stand at the front of the boat with a rusty ' harpoon . We approached the whales , and down they went , silent as could be , into a silent sea . I was shaking like a leaf . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Throw it ! Throw the harpoon ! ' yelled the captain , but I could n't Then one of the whales spouted , drenching us all , and they all disappeared again , and there I was , still standing there with the harpoon . I 'm just very glad that I was more sensible than the captain , because if I had thrown that harpoon , the whale might have given the boat a flip , and then I would n't be here today . This story has to do with Earth Day , if we think of nature as the whale and man as the whaler . We have been fighting nature , and when you fight someone he fights hack , and he can often do more damage than you can . Unless we stop stealing , exploiting , and ruining nature for our own gain , we will lose everything . The Church must begin talking a theology of ecology . The Garden of Eden has been misinter  --  preted . When God gave man dominion over the earth , Be meant man and earth to live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We must fit in with the rhythm , the silence , the music , and the beauty of nature . That 's about all I have to say today . So let 's all just have a very good time  --  until you have to go back to class . " N the Parsons School of De-sign , Stewart Brand , the originator of the Whole Earth Catalog , addressed an Earth Day audience of students and faculty members in a room full of balloons . The Whole Earth Catalog is published six times a year , in larger and larger press runs , and its purpose , stated on page 2 of each issue , is as follows : We are as gods and might as well get good at it . So far remotely done power and glory  --  as via government , big business , formal education , church  --  has succeeded to the point where gross defects obscure actual gains . In response to this dilemma and to these gains a realm of intimate , personal power is developing ? ? power of the individual to conduct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shape his own environment , and share his adventure with whoever is interested . Tools that aid this process are sought and promoted by the WHOLE EARTH CATALOG . Mr , Brand was wearing a buckskin shirt and a sort of felt top hat , and he was sitting backward on a folding chair . He has a lean face , white teeth , and blond hair . Someone asked him how to go about taking effective action in ecological matters . Mr. Brand said , " Would you please rephrase that ques  --  tion as a statement ? Silence is a good beginning for effective action . I 've al  --  ways wondered what two years of si  --  lence did . for Buckminster Fuller . The greatest accomplishments come from doing nothing . I once got gond advice from Ken Kesey on how to make money , and I never expected to get good advice from Kesey on how to make money . He said when he and his brother started a creamery he decided he wanted to make money . He set this as a goal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it completely and concentrated on running a good cream ery . When he ran a good creamery , he started making money . ? Vlien you take hold of ecology , it will help if you have a firm understanding of the order of nature and if you have a good metapro  --  gram . Do nothing first , and then do something . And making mistakes is all right , because making mistakes is syn  --  onymous with education . When we realize that we are as gods , then we will know that we have to assume a god 's responsibilities , and that we are able to . Most good things are very simple . " FOLrRTEENTH STREET was also closed to traffic , but from noon to midnight . Green , blue , red , and orange banners flapped from the tops of lamp  --  posts . Various booths had been set up on the sidewalks  --  the Environmental Ac  --  tion Coalition , the American Move  --  ment for World Government , the New York City Department of Con  --  sumer Affairs , the Socialist ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Abatement , the Citizens ' League for Education About Atomic Energy , and so on . At Fourteenth Street and Sev  --  enth Avenue , at noon , a group of hip  --  pies sat down on the asphalt and began writing out slogans in chalk : " If You 're Not Part of the Solution , You 're Part of the Problem . " " 50% Off on Viet  --  nam . " " We Treat This World of Ours as if We Had a Spare One in Our Back Pocket . " " Walk a Bicycle , Take a Bus , Your Car Fumes Are Killing Us . " A block or so east , the Salvation Army Headquarters was decorated with a fan of American flags and a sign that said " Clean Air Great , Clean Hearts Better . " Nearby , a round-faced , brown-haired woman was selling multicolored balloons hearing the words " Stop at Two . " " Two what ? " someone asked her . " Chil  --  dren , " she replied crisply , and pointed to a poster that said " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Square , there was a tank truck filled with what a sign identified as " Pure Water from the Catskill Watershed . " People waited in line to get a drink . Nearby , a group of young green , blue , red , and or  --  ange banners still hung dra  --  matically from the lamp  --  posts , and hundreds of peo  --  ple were still on the street , strolling in groups of two and three . People walked slowly and quietly , not just straight along the street or at right angles to it , as they usually do , but in all sorts of random directions . Fre  --  quently , people stopped to admire chalked drawings of birds and animals on the pavement , and to read eco  --  logical graffiti aloud to each other . " We Arc Coughing for a Pollution-Free New York , " said one graffito . " Toujours Verdant , " said another . " Would n't It Be Nice If You Could Read This a Week from Now ? " said a third . The street was absolutely free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hippie ap  --  proached three policemen . " Excuse me , Sergeant , " he said to one of them . " Do you know how much long  --  er we have ? " " Until midnight , I think , " the ser  --  geant said . " Thank you , " the hippie said . " Hey , I like your button , " said one of the other policemen , who was wear  --  ing yellow-tinted spectacles and was about the same age as the hippie . " Where can I get one of those ? " " Why do n't you take this one ? I have another at home , " the hippie said , and he handed the policeman his but  --  ton . It showed a yellow submarine with a peace symbol on it and flowers com  --  ing nut of the snorkel . The policeman pinned it on his uniform . " Have you heard the new McCart  --  ney album ? " asked the third police  --  man . " I 've heard a couple of cuts on the radio , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " There 's a new Beatles album com  --  ing out pretty soon , " the hippie said . " I 'm waiting for that . " " Beautiful , " the policeman said . The hippie wandered off . His brow was knitted , but he was smiling . At midnight , a police sound truck drove down the middle of the street , announcing , " Please return to the side  --  walk . Fourteenth Street is now being reopened . " A few moments later , a noisy phalanx of headlights appeared at Union Square , and a few moments after that it started to rain .
