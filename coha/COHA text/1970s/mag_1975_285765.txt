In Florida , where land scandals date back to the 1920s , state officials have uncovered what could be the biggest and most Byzantine fraud of them all . As many as 80,000 investors and buyers of lots may have been bilked of $1 billion by development companies and mortgage brokers in Southern Florida . According to investigators , the Ponzi-like scheme worked this way : the developers bought nearly worthless tracts of land , subdivided them and sold homesites at inflated prices ; they used the proceeds to pay high interest on bogus notes sold to investors under a false claim that the notes were secured by first mortgages on the homesites . When the recession slowed lot sales , many developers defaulted . Investors who tried to foreclose discovered that the real first mortgages were held by banks and other original lenders , so that they had no claim . Last week TIME Atlanta Correspondent Jack White talked with victims and investigators in Florida . His report : <P> <P> Many of the victims are self-admitted patsies , whose usual wariness evaporated in dreams of heady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought I could double our money , " concedes Philip Profita , 60 , a Fort Myers machinist who bought $21,000 worth of promissory notes from now defunct Homestate Investments Inc . Even though a local banker warned him against it , Floyd Campbell , 69 , a retired service engineer , invested $35,000 in what he thought was first mortgages in a Continental Investments Inc. development . " The banker said he could n't afford to pay interest like that , " Campbell recalls , " so I said what the hell . " Many victims were lulled into a false sense of security by newspaper advertising . One of Homestate 's ads read , 10.85%-12.85% EFFECTIVE RETURN . . . EVERY DOLLAR INVESTED IS 100% SECURED BY FIRST MORTGAGES AND CONTRACTS FOR DEEDS . <P> <P> According to the victims , state authorities might have stopped the bogus deals long ago . In April 1974 , Richard Booth , then an assistant state attorney general , outlined the schemes to four state law-enforcement officials and warned that they could result in " the loss of millions of dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the warning . Instead , complaints appear to have been bucked from one state agency to another , while each tried to determine if it had jurisdiction . Last week State Representative H. Paul Nuckolls called for a legislative investigation of the " coverup " by agencies . <P> Assistant State Attorney Louis St. Laurent has begun probing alleged security violations by 36 interlocking development and securities sales companies that did business in the Fort Myers area . By his estimate , investors in Lee County alone were bilked of $50 million . The loss by noteholders throughout the U.S. could reach $350 million . Even that sum could be dwarfed by the losses suffered by people who bought lots . In many cases , developers sold lots for about ten times the $200 to $400 they had paid for them in new " developments " that could not be built because they are partially under water even during the dry season or zoned for agricultural purposes .
