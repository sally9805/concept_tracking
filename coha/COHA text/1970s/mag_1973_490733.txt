THE TALK , OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment ONCE more , we have heard from our friend the long-winded lady . She writes as follows : " It is ten degrees above zero , five o'clock in the morning , and I have just returned to this hotel after a visit to Bickford 's , where I had a cup of coffee . I had to get the elevator man to let me out of the hotel . The outer doors arc locked for security reasons , and in the little vestibule between the inner and outer doors such a blast of hot air was pouring up that I was glad to get out of it into the icy cold outside . There is no wind . The morning is still and dark , with the touch of anxiety that comes with waiting . It is time for the day to begin . For the moment , as I hurried around the corner to reach brightly lighted Bickford 's as quickly as possible , I saw that the avenue  --  Sixth Avenue  --  was swept clean of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oasis of stillness , very hard and remote in outline but not unfriendly . I could n't even hear my own footsteps . I am wearing fur mukluks I bought at Lord &; Taylor , and I pad along making no sound . I did n't look up at the sky to see if I could find moon or stars , but I did take a quick look back up along Sixth Avenue and saw that uptown a little forest of Christmas trees was still glimmering whitely , seeming tall even against the high glass cliffs that ought to dwarf it . " Bickford 's , which used to be a place of gay pastel plastic decor and bucket-shaped seats , is now comparatively sombre , with shiny brown panelling on the walls , and countrified wooden stools , but the background array of jello and pie and fruit salad is as dominant as always , and the orange juice still bubbles away in its big glass dome . And the coffee is very hot . The waitresses wear white nylon uniforms , with woolly colored cardigans to ward off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair and a hard , kind face . She told me she was very tired . I 'm not used to night work , ' she said . She brought over one of those heavy metal baskets of glasses to he put away , and as she set it down she knocked her elbow against the edge of the basket , hurting herself . ' See , knocked my funnybone , ' she said as she rubbed bet elbow . ' I 'm asleep on my feet . I 'm not used to night work . That 's what I 'm telling you . I 've been working days always . ' Bickford 's was well lighted , as usual , but it was quiet there . About fi fteen customers stood or sat around , scattered here and there at the counters , some of them talking in murmurs and some of them stony-still , with their hands holding their coffee cups . One man was fast asleep , with his fare in the Doily News . A thin woman in a drab brown coat and with a little brown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was so dark and cold outside , and so quiet , so warm and quiet , inside , that We all seemed to he sitting in the half-light  --  a sequestered feeling . " When I finished my coffee , I thought of having a second cup , but I did n't . Bickford 's seemed sad , in con-trast to its usual brassy air , and I did n't want to stay there . I hurried along Sixth Avenue , and there were two peo-ple ahead of me  --  a man and a woman with their arms around each other 's shoulders but walking quite quickly just the same . They were in haste , and I got the impression they had a long way to go . I rang the bell to get hack into the hotel , and this time I was glad of that blast of warm air in the little vestibule . " " On the other hand , we have no way of knowing if the Micronesians received the same assistance . " pursuing their interests amid the steel and granite of New York City @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning and early-afternoon panel discussions and meetings , the talk , of course , was mostly about weeds and chemicals , and it was strictly scientist talk : lots of Latin names for weeds , and chemical terms for what to treat the weeds with . We could understand little of it . Every once in a while , however , a scientist let drop the name of a weed in plain English , and , putting these occasional morsels together , we ended up with a list of weeds that  --  except for crabgrass  --  we had not heard of before . Late that afternoon , we went to the Windsor Ballroom , where a number of the scientists were having what they called a mixer ; that is , they were standing around drinking draft beer or Coca-Cola , and , in their language , still being scientists together . We took our list up to one of them  --  Dr. Donald N. Riemer , of the Department of Soils and Crops at Rutgers  --  and , telling him we knew little or nothing about weeds , asked him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he would he glad to do what he could , but we should un derstand that he was not an expert on all weeds  --  only on aquatic weeds . He explained that there are experts on aquatic weeds , experts on agronomic weeds , experts on horticultural weeds , experts on weeds that infest ornamentals ( e.g. , flowers ) , and experts on brush and non-crop weeds . To provide a broader range of expertise , Dr. Riemer called over three of his colleagues , and , having told them of our interest , sat all of us down around a table . The others who all seemed glad to help ? were Dr. John F. Ahrens , plant scientist at the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station , in Windsor ; James H. Flanagan , herbicide specialist at the CIBA-GEIGY Corporation , in Ardsky ; and John E. Gallagher , **28;4309;TOOLONG specialist at Amchem Products , in Ambler , Pennsylvania . What followed was a sort of exchange of notes among the four men , for our benefit , and we took down what we heard going on around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning . A weed  --  and , as you already know , a weed is simply a plant that is out of place  --  could be bluegrass in a strawberry bed , or redtop grass among cranberries . By themselves , they are anything but weeds . Bluegrass is a high-quality turf grass , and redtop is an excellent forage grass . Wheat growing among corn , or corn growing among wheat , is a weed . They compete for water , nutrients , and growing space . Crabgrass is Public Enemy No. 1 to the homeowner , because it crowds out the other grass . " " Water milfoil and pondweed are aquatic weeds , and they can be extremely dangerous . Swimming in a pond or lake , you can get tangled in them and drown . A very good friend of mine  --  a weed scientist , as a matter of fact  --  got drowned in some of these weeds while carrying out a scientific investigation . Also , certain aquatic weeds produce toxins that are injurious to fish . " " Nut sedge is one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third in all countries within reasonable distance of the equator . It plays havoc with potato fields and corn fields , owing mainly to its spcarlike root , which shoots out horizontally and grows right through potatoes . " " Barnyard grass infests corn , rice , and other grain crops . It looks like a three-foot corn plant . We call it the prostitute of the botanical world , because , growing in fourteen recognizable varieties , it is not particular about what other weeds it mates with . " " Foxtail is an aggressive , competitive weed  --  more aggressive than , say , carpetweed . The foxtail seed head  --  a long stalk with a brushlike tip  --  looks like a bottle washer or literally like a fox 's tail . " " Jimsonweed is a major nuisance in soybean crops . If you are a soybean farmer in the Carolinas or in Virginia , then jimsonweed is your No . I enemy . It blooms in a big , tubular flower , generally white . " " Pigwced is ubiquitous . You find it in almost any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applies to lamb's-quarters . It has a long , thick stalk  --  about six feet high  --  and spreads about three feet in all directions . It is a threat mostly to horticultural and vegetable crops , and its bask method of survival is by producing millions of seeds . " " When you say ragweed , you say hay fever . It grows alongside almost every country road . It is said that the American Indian never had hay fever until the white man came . According to the story , when the white man came and started cutting down the trees and clearing the fields , the first weed to appear was ragweed . It just loves the open spaces . " " Bindweed is the scourge of several sections of the country . It has spread throughout the soybean belt and the corn belt . Its root has been found to go as far as thirty feet into the ground . You can chop it down all you want , or pull up as much of it as possible , but you just ca n't get rid of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grass ' tickle grass , ' because it tickles the maidens when they frolic in it . It is a very vigorous competitor . Like nut sedge , it has a root that spears right through potatoes or carrots . You 'll find lots of it in Canada as well , for it will live through the coldest winters . " " Well , we could tell you about Johnson grass , love grass , fall panicum , smart-weed , purslane , pepperweed , knawel , henbit  --  you name it . There are more than a hundred commonly occurring weeds that are of interest to weed scientists . " The offer was tempting , but we said it would he too much for one sitting . We thanked the four scientists and excused ourself , thinking , as we Left , of another definition we had heard that day . " What is a weed ? " one of the scientists had said , quoting Emerson . " A plant whose virtues have not yet been discovered . " In that sense , we concluded , these experts who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scarcely be considered weeds . Looking In DANNY KAYE , a comedian of indefatigable wit and infinite variety , turned up at the Metropolitan Opera recently as the host of a couple of Look-Ins  --  ninety-minute programs that introduced a total of eight thousand grade-school children to the enchanting unreality of grand opera . Look-Ins were invented at the Stockholm Opera by the late Goeran Gentele , the Swedish impresario who ran the Met briefly , until his death in an automobile accident last summer . The format has been Americanized by a team consisting of Mr. Kaye ; Mr. Gentele 's widow , Mark ; and Schuyler Chapin , the acting general manager of the company . ( Mr. Chapin is fond of quoting his predecessor 's remark that one must poison the minds of potential operagoers at an early age . ) The Metropolitan Look-In begins with a technical tour of the stage area , which includes demonstrations of lighting , sound effects , and stage machinery ; continues with a survey of the various types of operatic voices ; and ends with two staged excerpts  --  a slapstick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the triumphal scene from " Aida . " We dropped by the Metropolitan to catch a Look-In rehearsal , and found that Mr. Kaye , whose legendary charm is tempered by an authoritarian personality , had virtually taken over the house . " You know who it is he reminds me of ? " said a friend we encountered in one of the corridors . " The conductor Herbert von Karajan , who insists on being in charge of absolutely everything . " We opened one of the auditorium doors and spotted Mr. Kaye  --  a tall , angular man who has light-blue eyes , a large nose , and permanently rumpled blond hair  --  pacing back and forth across the stage , on which were three sixteenth-century Venetian galleons mounted on rolling platforms . " Now , fellas , " said Mr. Kaye , peering across the footlights at a group of Metropolitan executives who were assembled in one aisle as stand-ins for the schoolchildren , " I want all of you to say . One , two , three , ROCK ! ' and then I want those ships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until Mr. Kaye stopped them with an imperious gesture , stamped one foot to get absolute silence , and went on to conduct them in a very precise chorus . Behind him , the three ships bobbed back and forth like corks on a riptide . " Marvellous ! " said Mr. Kaye , putting his hands in his pockets . " Now , here are our ships on a peaceful summer evening  --  blue sky , stars out . Suppose they get hit by a tropical storm . " " Dave , " said Rudolph Kuntner , the director of stage operations , " get me the Otello ' clouds . Georgie , bring in thunder and lightning when he 's ready . " A few minutes later , lightning crackled and thunder rolled as gray storm clouds scudded across the hundred- r and-nine-foot-tall cyclorama behind the ships . " Now we get into a battle , " said Mr. Kaye , who had the rapt look of a child playing with a toy railroad , " and we destroy the whole enemy fleet . But our ships burn up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Kuntner , " get out the magic-fire slides . Georgie , we 're going to take the ships down five feet when I give the cue . " A red glow appeared behind the ships , which were disappearing slowly into the floor , and we recognized it as the fire that normally surrounds Briinnhilde 's rock . " Now , " said Mr. Kaye when only the masts were showing , " we have to bail out the ships and save everybody . BUCKETS ! I WANT TWELVE STAGEHANDS WITH BUCKETS ! " He pantomimed a drowning sailor as four startled-looking stagehands emerged from the wings and stood holding fire pails . Mr. Kaye showed them how to toss buckets of invisible water over their shoulders , and walked back to the footlights , looking pleased . " The kids should love that effect , " he said . " Maybe we ought to have a chorus backstage singing Hallelujah . ' DAVE ! REVERSE THE 1VII0i E PROCEDURE ! " As the fire faded and the ships emerged from the floor , Mr. Kaye crossed a makeshift bridge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where James Levine , the cherubic , fuzzy-haired IV undcrkind who is the Met 's new principal conductor , introduced him to the musicians . " Give me a sforzando in G , " said Mr. Kaye , seizing a baton and raising both arms for the downbeat . The orchestra replied with a sustained blast . " Now a very short one , " said Mr. Kaye . The orchestra cheeped . " Was that a G or an F ? " inquired Mr. Kaye , cupping a hand behind his left car . " Let 's go on to the main He 1 the orchestra through a course . " ed breathless version of the circus ) finish of Ponchielli 's " Dance of the Hours , " pausing before the final chord to trap an unwary cymbal player into a solo crash . " Fooled you , did n't I ? " Mr. Kaye said as the musicians burst into laugh to r . " Now , fellas , let 's do it a hit slower , and we 'll read it this time , " Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and winds with sharp stabs of an index finger , imploring the strings , with theatrical swoops of his left arm , to sing , and raising his eyebrows in pleased astonishment when the percussion section came in at exactly the right moment . " Fellas , that was a Beecham tempo , " he said when they had finished . " Tomorrow , I want to do it a hit brighter . Let 's make all the changes loud and abrupt , because we 're buried down here in a hole . " He handed the baton to Mr. Levine , walked hack a few rows , and collapsed into a red velvet armchair a few feet from where we were sitting . We introduced ourself and asked Mr. Kaye if he could read music . " Not a note , " he told us proudly , " but I conduct a lot of orchestras around the country in pension-fund concerts . My repertoire includes Beethoven , Tchaikovsky , Rossini , Ravel , Wagner , and Verdi , and I can sing you every entrance of every brass , every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play . What I 'm trying to do here is to give kids a sense  --  informally of how this theatre runs , of what an incredible number of people it takes to put on an opera , of how exciting a live performance can he . If even a small percentage of them go home and say , ' Gee , I want to come hack and sec what a real opera looks like , ' we 'll all be very pleased . The musical parts of the program are set in advance , but I 've asked the stage crew to stay loose , because I 'm go3 " Dear , you remember Mrs. Leeming . We met way back during Civil Rights . " ? ? ing to improvise everything in between with the kids . This horrifies a lot of people in this efficient , well-organized company . " " How will you introduce the opera scenes ? " we asked " For the ' Barber , ' I 'm going to explain that most people think opera means tragedy , " said Mr Kaye . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy poisons girl . Or boy stabs girl , or boy pushes girl off a cliff . So on the rare occasions when we have a funny opera we play it broadly . Besides , we must all remember that Rossini 's tenor is related to Verdi 's baritone . " " How do you figure that " we asked . " Our tenor , Enrico Di Giuseppe , is from Philadelphia , " said Mr. Kaye . " So is Lucine Amara , the daughter of the baritone in ' Aida . ' It 's all perfectly clear . " " Tell us about ' Aida , ' " we said . " A touching story that was adapted from an unknown papyrus , " said Mr. Kaye . " The soprano is the daughter of the baritone , who everybody thinks is a tenor disguised as a bass . Then , there 's the high priest  --  another bass  --  who wants the tenor not to marry the soprano , because the other soprano is crazy about the baritone . At the end of the triumphal scene , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the hand of the mezzo-soprano , who looks down her spinto at him . I 'm probably going to wind up saying Look , fellas , forget about the plot . Let 's just look and listen . ' " A half hour later , Mr. Levine , who had conducted a run-through of the " Aida " scene , came over to tell Mr. Kaye that eleven solo artists were waiting onstage to work out the vocal part of the program . " I asked each one of them to prepare a musical passage that would show what the voice can do , " he said . " I think some ensemble work might he nice , " Mr. Kaye replied thoughtfully . " Three basses singing Notte e giorno , ' from the beginning of ' Don Giovanni . ' Two tenors taking turns with the high C 's in that aria from Daughter of the Regiment . ' Three Carmens in the card scene . How about eleven people singing the quartet from Rigoletto ' ? That might get vu interested in opera again . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a smile . " One of my spies saw you backstage at Otello ' last night . He said you conducted almost every bar . "
