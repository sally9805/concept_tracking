THE SPIDER 'S STRATAGEM <P> Directed by BERNARDO BERTOLUCCI Screenplay by BERNARDO BERTOLUCCI , EDOARDO DE GREGORI and MARILU PAVOLINI <P> Made in 1969 for Italian television , this mesmeric film is only now being released in America , in the wake of the wide acclaim for Bertolucci 's The Conformist and in anticipation of the brouhaha over Last Tango in Paris ( TIME cover , Jan. 22 ) . Perhaps Tango may not SO much sweep up The Spider 's Stratagem in its wake as swamp it . The Spider 's Stratagem boasts no superstars in the cast , no odor of brimstone and no heavy hype . It should not need them . Less exotic than The Conformist or Tango , certainly more subtle and contained . The Spider 's Strata gem is Bertolucci 's best movie . <P> Like such otherwise di verse works as Godard 's Contempt and Peckinpah 's The Wild Bunch , The Spider 's Stratagem concerns the workings of myth , the complicity of fancy and legend in history . The screenplay is an extrapolation from a short fiction by Jorge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which a historical researcher , investigating the death of his great-grandfather , a political martyr , discovers that the man actually traduced his confederates . <P> He collaborated in arranging his own murder at the hands of his allies , choosing " circumstances deliberately dramatic , which would engrave themselves upon the popular imagination and which would speed the revolt . " <P> Details of the death scenario were drawn from literature . <P> In Borges , the researcher becomes an accomplice to the fiction ; in the Bertolucci adaptation , he becomes a vic tim of it . Borges ' " oppressed and stubborn country " becomes Tara , a fictional village in the Po Valley , a place of old men and tenacious memories . The great-grandfather becomes a father . <P> The researcher , Athos Magnani ( Giulio Brogi ) , is summoned to Tara by his slain father 's mistress ( Alida Valli ) . A statue of the senior Magnani , resting upon a pedestal bearing the legend " vilely murdered by Fascist bullets , " stands in the town square , surveying all who pass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learns the truth about his father 's treachery , he learns , too , that it is irrelevant . History , in a trim irony , becomes the distortion . The myth becomes the vital , seductive reality . Inextricably ensnared in it , Athos can not leave the town . At the station , successive announcements are made that the Parma train is late . Its arrival will probably be postponed infinitely . Athos kneels to look at the tracks . They are overgrown with weeds . <P> Bertolucci , like Borges , deliberately omits any explanation for the hero 's initial treachery . Author and director both are interested not so much in the act itself as in its effects . The measures taken to mask the incident become a paradigm of the process of myth . Bertolucci suggests the perpetual , inexorable influence of the past by the ingenious expedient of having the characters-the mistress , the father 's comrades-look in flashback as they do in the present : the same age , the same aspect , even , at times , a suggestion of the same costume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staring into a mirror and seeing everything save yourself decades younger .
