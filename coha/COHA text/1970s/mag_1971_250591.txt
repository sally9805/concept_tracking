At first glance , and even at second , The Mephisto Waltz looks a lot like Rosemary 's Granddaughter . There are the ambitious husband , beleaguered wife , treacherous new acquaintances , sympathetic old friends , intimations of perversion and , finally , the confirmation of diabolism . Yet for all the obvious echoes of its superior predecessor , Waltz stands on its own as a sleek and scary piece of movie necromancy . <P> Alan Alda appears as a failed concert pianist turned journalist . He is assigned to interview a master pianist ( Curt Jurgens ) , who treats him with impenetrable superiority until he notices Alda 's hands . " Hands like yours are one in a hundred thousand , " the maestro exclaims , with blurred syntax , seizing Alda 's forearms and showing them off to his daughter ( Barbara Parkins ) , who responds with pronounced interest .

His wife , in the meantime , has stumbled on some evidence ( a book of incantations , a flask of mysterious blue oil , more or less the usual things ) that strongly suggests that her husband 's new-found musical talents are at least uncanny , and probably a good deal more . During the rest of the picture she pays , as they say , a dear price for such knowledge . <P> Director Paul Wendkos has perhaps taken the suggestion of his title a bit too literally . He seizes every available opportunity to dance his camera around , photographing from acrobatic angles and utilizing a full spectrum of weird color filters . If the technique is somewhat distracting , at least he succeeds in achieving a good sense of clammy terror . The Mephisto Waltz is not one of those really goose-fleshy horror pictures that make you edgy about opening the front door when you get home from the theater . But it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next time you attend a piano recital .
