Drawing is an explicit business , a matter of black and white . The old masters drew to discover a final form , to stabilize reality before painting it . But what if drawing is not about definitions , what if it chooses to study the instabilities of perception ? Such is the question hidden in the work of a masterfully gifted Israeli artist named Avigdor Arikha , whose exhibition of ink drawings-seen last year at Marlborough Galleries in Manhattan-is now on show in Fort Worth . <P> Arikha , who was born 44 years ago in Rumania , survived the Nazi labor camps in Central Europe and was repatriated as an orphan to an Israeli kibbutz in 1944 . He studied art and philosophy in Paris-where he still lives with his wife and two children in an icon-cluttered apartment-and until 1965 was an abstract painter . Then came a volte-face ; since that year , he has concentrated entirely on life drawing , thus reversing the usual modernist 's development . " I was born into modern art , " he says , " and it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in any case I have left it . My brush drawings are postabstract , and could not have come into being without abstraction . " <P> In his return to the limits of graphic art , Arikha has produced some of the most remarkable images on paper since the death of Giacometti . Arikha 's drawings of landscapes , old shoes and coats , his own face or that of a friend like Samuel Beckett , may seem frustrating at first . They look messy and disclose themselves slowly . None of the hard , wiry line of pen or silverpoint here ; the brush ( the kind used in Japan for sumi-e or ink painting ) flits and stumbles across the roughly textured page , leaving behind tiny marks that seem knitted or crocheted together . <P> One thinks , as an approximate parallel , of the flat , densely woven brush-work in late Monet . Because Arikha uses undiluted black ink on untinted white paper , the shifts of tone depend entirely on the pressure of the brush . But his sense of gradation , from deep velvety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> It is art by cumulative notation , airy , insubstantial and very delicate . The process of seeing and the act of drawing are telescoped together . Each mark is a deciphering of the bewildering flux of impressions that beat upon the eye . Arikha 's work seems both provisional and irrevocable . <P> Although they all come from live models or immediate motifs , none of Arikha 's pages look as if they began with a firm , a priori grasp of reality . A case in point is his Self-Portrait Shouting One Morning , 1969 . " I was in a filthy mood , " Arikha recalls . " I climbed out of bed , yelling at my wife , yelling at the shaving mirror . . . " The bleary-eyed moment of evil temper is caught with acid precision in an image as transitory as the mood itself . The quick , scrubby notations for nose and cheek bone and wiry corncob hair compose themselves around the black hole of a mouth ; it is calligraphy as snapshot . <P> Arikha draws in order to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There is probably not an artist of his generation who has shown so vividly the questions and feedbacks that beset the strange activity known as drawing from life . <P> <P> Robert Hughes
