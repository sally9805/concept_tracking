What Will They Forecast for 1975 ? Prophets and Losses by Milton Gwirtzman One memorable episode in a popular radio show of the 1940s , " I Love A Mystery , " concerned a mean old man who spent his life playing the stock market . As he bent over his charts day after day , he thought of what a killing he could make if he could only see tomorrow afternoon 's newspaper today . Through some occult twist , his wish was granted . Greedily he worked through the night copying the final stock quotations . Then he turned to the obituary page and saw , to his horror , the notice of his own death . His servant found him in the morning . I was reminded of this episode several weeks ago by a full page advertisement in The New York Times for Barron 's , the financial weekly published by Dow-Jones , Inc . " Help Us Bid A Fond Farewell to 1974 , " it said , and it was illustrated by a man being chased by a bear . The ad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year-end issue . " Interest runs unusually high in Barron 's last issue of the year , " it said , " for our readers know that this is the issue when Barron 's editorial staff and a panel of financial authorities peer into the future year . And since Barron 's readers habitually focus their attention on Barron 's future-oriented editorial , this issue really draws a crowd . " While economic journals are not the only ones that cater to the public 's itch to know the future ( the late Drew Pearson used to say his political predictions were " 90 percent accurate 40 percent of the time " ) , they are by far the most detailed and quantified . Seatof-the-pants economic forecasting has been replaced by so-called " econometric models . " These are computers that store the nation 's economic behavior . When fed certain trends and assumptions about the economy and fiscal and monetary policy , they disgorge precise statistical estimates on next year 's inflation rate , unemployment and other economic indicators . To help evaluate the predictions being made for 1975 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1974 . It will be remembered as the year the cost of food and fuel skyrocketed , inflation hit double digits , credit dried up , the stock market dropped 300 points and , in the last months , a severe recession took hold . At first the troubles were blamed on the paralysis of the national government while the fate of President Nixon Miu-oisi S. GWIRTZMAN is a Washington , DC attorney and author who has written several critiques of American journalism.remained uncertain . In mid-summer that doubt was eliminated and the economy really went to hell . How did this compare with what the nation 's leading economic journals said would happen ? To begin I consulted Barron 's year-end issue . The consensus of the eight " experts from the world of finance " who made up its panel was that 1974 would be " subdued ? but bullish . " One of them , Walter Mintz , a partner in an investment management firm , talked of a " reasonable chance that the rate of inflation will be substantially less in six to nine months than it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Smilen , said " we now have very constructive forces at work and a very favorable investment climate for major sectors of the economy . " This was in line with the conclusion of Barron 's own editorial of the previous week , entitled " Could Be A New Bull Market . " I then turned to the January 4 issue of Kiplinger 's Washington letter , the most successful of the dozens of economic tipsheets that originate in the Capital . 1974 would be " a year of basic strengths in the economy , sound enough to avoid serious trouble . And GAINING strength on the way . . . It wo n't be a spectacular year ... but we believe a recession or a serious slump will not materialize . " Kiplinger predicted a maximum inflation of eight percent ( it has been more like 12 percent ) and an " easing off " of interest rates from the then current level of nine percent ( they climbed to 12 percent ) . These statements were hedged by a warning that business prospects would depend heavily on the public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disturbing factor now , " Kiplinger warned . But , taking a deep breath , he forecast that prospects for impeachment were slim . " " Might Nixon resign ? We doubt it , from what we know about him and his willingness to fight . The House inquiry wo n't faze him much . We believe he will stay in office ... that a tidal wave against him is improbable . " Fortune magazine 's issue of January 1974 was even more reassuring : ' Despite the oil crisis , and despite worries about a severe recession , economic growth over the next 18 months as a whole will about match that of the past 18 . " By spring , Fortune said , the economy would begin to expand . The 1974 rise in the real gross national product , adjusted for inflation , would be 2.4 percent ( it declined over three percent ) . New DECEMBER 28 , 1974 starts in the housing industry would soon climb back to a healthy annual rate of two million ( they are down to 900,000 ) . " The inflationary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharply , " and lower prices paid to farmers would " retard food prices from rising much . " As for fuel , the other wild card in the inflation deck , Fortune saw only a slight increase in the price of crude oil ? from the then-current six dollars a barrel to " upwards of $7.00 . " Unfortunately the oil producing countries jacked up the price of crude to $11.00 , with this issue of Fortune still on the newsstands . U. S. News and World Report teases its readers with stories whose headlines promised sure-fire answers ( " Will There Be A Recession ? " " How Much Inflation ? " " Which Way the Stock Market Now ? " ) and offers carefully hedged conclusions or none at all . Its 1974 forecasts were unexpectedly straightforward , with precise statistical estimates of how each of the most important economic barometers would read . A comparison of U. S. News ' predictions with what actually happened shows this : U.S. News Forrract Actual Cost of Living Wholesale Prices Industrial Output Homebuilding Starts ( ann . rate as of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Business Week , in its year-end issue , had no forecasts of its own but instead presented an ambitious summary of the predictions of 25 economists and eight econometric models . From these the magazine concluded that " business will drag during the first half of the year , perhaps even sliding into a recession ; in the second half , a recovery will get underway . " Both the machines and the humans surveyed by Business Week sharply underestimated the inflation that was coming . Their estimates ranged from five percent to 7.5 percent . Partly for this reason , 24 of the 25 predicted that real income would increase in 1974 . It dropped . The booby prize was won by the computer programmed by Raymond Fair of Princeton University , the fellow who furnished the statistical backup for Sen. George McGovern 's $1000-to-everybody demogrant scheme during the 1972 election . The Fair econometric model predicted a real increase in the GNP of 3.5 percent , inflation of only 4.7 percent and average unemployment of only 4.8 percent . General predictions , while interesting , do n't do much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do with his money in the coming year . Kiplinger 's Changing Times specializes in such advice . Its January 1974 issue interviewed Dr. Martin Gainsbrugh , formerly chief economist of the National Industrial Conference Board , a research organization financed by some of the country 's largest corporations . Putting what it called " the straightest questions we could think of about the future " to Dr. Gainsbrugh , it urged13 its readers to " use the answers for guidance in planning your financial strategy for the year ahead . " Dr. Gainsbrugh stressed that there would be no recession unless the Arab oil embargo , then in effect , proved to be " prolonged . " He said the rise in food prices " will begin to taper off around the second quarter " of 1974 . Asked how a family could cope with continuing inflation , he replied : " the best inflation hedge for the average family is the purchase of a home and the paying off of a mortgage over the next 10 or 20 years in ever-softer dollars . " But banks stopped lending home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The financial journals were eager to help people make their way in the new year 's stock market . None of them , unfortunately , offered what would prove to be the only useful advice : get out or sell short . Forbes magazine sought out David Babson , of the Boston investment counseling firm of the same name , which had at the time over $1.5 billion of other people 's money under management . " What does Babson recommend for investors ? " asked the Forbes editors . " Bury their money ? Put it in a savings bank ? Buy bonds ? " No , said Babson . His hedge against inflation was none of those . It was " growth stocks . " The Forbes editors were incredulous . After all , the market in 1973 had taken a severe heating , and the threat of shortages hung over the fastest-growing industries . Were Babson and his colleagues still believers in the growth stock theory ? " Yes , we are , " Babson replied . " This is the time to be investing cash . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are better than they have been in a long time . " Babson urged the purchase of what he called " seasoned growth stocks , " specifically the following : Xerox ( which was to fall 55 percent in value in 1974 ) ; Coca-Cola ( down 65 percent ) ; American Motors ( 60 percent ) ; IBM ( off 33 percent ) ; Merck ( down 20 percent ) ; Procter and Gamble ( 15 percent ) ; and Kodak ( 45 percent ) . Readers of Forbes would have been far better off burying their money . Babson was also interviewed by U.S. News on January 7 . He advised small investors to buy mutual funds , which he called " by far the most practical and the safest " investment medium for individuals " with modest amounts of capital to invest in equities . " Between January and October the total asset value of the nation 's mutual funds was to drop by $15 billion . Among the chief victims of the 1974 stock crash were the so-called institutions ? foundations , universities and pension plans ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and livelihood . Universities have reduced operations and laid off professors as the stocks in which much of their endowments are invested nosedived and the dividends they depend upon to finance their activities shrunk . In late summer of 1974 , the Ford Foundation announced that its portfolio , made up mostly of blue chip stocks , had declined by one billion dollars , and it would have to reduce its grants accordingly . Universities and foundations have long entrusted the care of their endowments to professional money managers and men of distinction . ( When I was at Harvard 20 years ago , we knew the endowment was in safe hands because it was managed by a Lowell . ) The magazine designed for these managers is the Institutional Investor , the most successful publication of the " go-go " stock era of the 1960s . Much of its 1974 issue was devoted to a survey among " hundreds of leading analysts " to determine the stocks that would selections and their performance in deleted table None of this will prevent the economic ioumals from predicting lust as boldly for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course , they might forecast nothing but gloom . Based on their recent performance , if that is what they say we are in for a pretty good year .
