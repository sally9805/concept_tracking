txt // we discard matters practically as much as what we adopt , though there is no way backwards . Neither philosophy nor religion ever returns to past stages , once a great step forward has been taken . The historical past is not reversible ; on the plane of the glory of great builders or destroyers of religions , and important philosophers , there is no retracing of steps . Once Jove had dethroned Chronos and the Titans , none of them could ever return to Olympus . What has been said by Plato or Hegel can neither be gainsaid nor effaced ; it can only be transcended , or partly replaced by another great philosophy or philosophies , which would have to sum up Plato or Hegel and subsume them in order to have any social or historical value . ( This is the case , for example , with Marxism , which has transcended certain aspects of Hegelianism , but which has not yet been transcended and therefore is still vital in our times . ) It is the same with religion ; there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rational , ineluctable necessity . Men may not see this , because they find it most difficult to see what stares them in the face , or they may , notwithstanding their assertion of objectivity , be as subjective as is normal , and try to discard or ignore what they dislike or fear . The fact is that the universe is fundamentally , irretrievably rational , and that if the human mind is given its chance it will , as part of the universe and endowed with the same structure , discover pro progressively and steadily the truth of the world in which it lives . It will discover the truth of the world as part of its becoming in which it participates , up to the point which its finitude enables it to reach , but not beyond . The world shows every-where repetitions and similarities of certain structures . This pattern includes the animal world and the human organism , and it stands to reason that the human mind , human reason , an essential part of the necessity which animates the universe , con tains or is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to those of nature and of things , and which , there-fore , must make it possible to have a growing re-cognition be tween the essence of reason and the essence of things . This // re-cognition is the task of the philosopher , the scientist and the artist . This similarity of structure between the world and mind must not be turned into the Berkeleyan notion that only the world of the mind exists , and that the world is purely and simply the subject 's representation . One must , I think , adopt the very reasonable Kantian notion that the objective world is constructed by the subject experiencing it according to its innate structures and categories . The mind is a synthesizing activity ; the categories are criteria of interpretation for realistic experience . Kant shares the Platonic principle that if any rational understanding is to be possible , the reason in man must be akin to the reason in things . Locke and Descartes held similar views , with the difference that God was for them the mediator between the reason in man and the reason in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as mediator between man and the understanding of the universe . Faith in reason and the rationality of the universe is not confined to pre-twentieth-century thought . Einstein , the great thinker of modern times , said : I believe in a world ruled by laws which I try to apprehend in a widely speculative manner . ' Einstein never accepted the view that reality could be reduced to probabilities and statistics ; and in that context it is interesting to see that Heisenberg himself , referring to Planck 's quantum theory , says : In recent years many investigations have been concerned with these difficulties i.e. concerning the attempt to arrive at a mathematical formulation of the interaction of the elementary particles , but so far no one has been able to arrive at a satisfactory solution . The only consolation is the assumption that in very small regions of space-time of the order of magnitude of the elementary particles , the notions of space and time become unclear , i.e. in very small intervals even the concepts " earlier " and " later " can no longer be properly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the large scale , but we must bear in mind the possibility that experiment may well prove that small-scale space-time processes may run in reverse to the causal sequence . // It is here that the latest developments of atomic physics once again come up against the question of causal laws . It is too early to say whether this will lead to new paradoxes , or that new deviations from causal laws will appear . Perhaps our attempts to formulate the laws of elementary particles mathematically will lead to new possibilities enabling us to avoid these difficulties . However , even now it has become quite certain that the latest developments in atomic physics will once more have repercussions in the sphere of philosophy . The final answer to the questions we have just posed will only come with the mathematical formulation of the natural laws governing the behaviour of elementary particles ; when , for instance , we shall know why it is that the proton happens to be precisely 1836 times as heavy as the electron . ' " The impossibility of ascertaining at the same time the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final nor a proof of random behaviour , there is still a certain element which renders possible the establishment of precise statistical laws ; secondly , this statistical aspect of particles ' behaviour does not affect the large-scale processes of behaviour in the life of the universe . All this boils down to the fact that the statistical behaviour of extremely small particles with practically no mass and no time-life is without effect in the life of large space-time regions in which order prevails . Einstein believed that form and structure were repeated in the universe and that man could apprehend them . The idea or form is the abstract structure or image as a projection of reality in the mind , which is thus enabled to re-cognize reality . Essential thought or ideas are undying ; they survive the pressure of their opposites , or they unite with them in new syntheses , leaving behind them remainders for new developments . Thought as idea is in fact an abstract or symbolic representation of forms , which are the essential structures of reality , facts , events or experiences , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That is to say , if there is no structural correspondence between mind and the real , there // can not be any apprehension of it . Natural science tells us nothing of the essential structure of things ; it is purely concerned with the way things work and the way they are related phenomenologically . Abstractions or ideas , of course , do not exist separately in their own right . They only exist as part of the whole which is the mind , or the whole which is Being . In the case of Being , becoming can only mean the eternal and continuous breaking up of the one into the many , and the final coming together of these fragments or parts into the one . That was the view of Empedocles , as well as of Hegel and Whitehead , though not quite that of Plato , for whom becoming was not the true reality , but only the maya or appearance of true reality , unchanging and eternal . Still , whether the becoming is only appearance , or is the actualization of the eternal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real essence of a thing is synonymous with the constitution of its structure . On this score even Locke , who could not by any stretch of the imagination be described as a Platonist or an idealist , agreed . All things have a structure which coordinates their finality , and whether one describes this finality as teleological or teleonomic ' is irrelevant . As Whitehead quotes Francis Bacon : All bodies whatsoever , though they have no sense , yet they have perception , for when one body is applied to another there is a kind of election to embrace that which is agreeable , and to exclude or expel that which is ingrate. ' 22 When an existential entity , be it an organism or a work of art , has achieved totality or wholeness , it means that each element and nothing more can contribute adequately to the harmony of the whole . Locke said : This is certain , things , however absolute and entire they seem in themselves , are but retainers to other parts of nature for that which they are most taken notice of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are owing to something without them ; and there is not so complete and perfect a part that we know of nature , which does not owe the being it has , and the excellencies of it , to its neighbours . ' 23 He further says : When we find out // an idea , by whose intervention we discover the connexion of two others , this is a revelation from God to us , by the voice of reason ; for we then come to know a truth that we did not know before . When God declares any truth to us , this is a revelation to us by the voice of his spirit , and we are advanced in our knowledge . ' 24 Change , process , becoming is therefore of the essence of Being , yet how then can the passing of things exhibit permanence ? It can do so only according to the forms or essences which inform them . The forms are transcendent and timeless , and their essence is to realize their potential through existence and actualization . Actualization implies elimination of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lay claims to actualization . There is no more addition to the eternal than there is addition to the total matter of the universe . Being , for Plato , is anything with the capacity of acting or of being acted upon . O Heavens , ' says he , can we ever be made to believe that motion and life , soul and mind are not present with absolute Being ? Can we imagine Being to be devoid of life and to remain in awful unmeaningness , an everlasting fixture ? ' Being contains the necessary motives for life and mind to realize themselves in time , and if it were not so there could be no possible explanation for existence . Any individuated entity has both a relationship with other entities and an essence which relates to the primordial essence . Nothing exists by itself , or can exist by itself . Life in all its aspects implies solidarity with and the need for others , irrespective of the instinct for survival which , at the natural level , can also crush or destroy others . Yet these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inter-relatedness of creation . Some things fall , some things rise , some have only a moment , a day or a year or so to live , and are consumed by others which in their turn are also consumed . Some mesons live only for a fraction of a second , yet they have their place in the universe , in which , as Shakespeare said , there is a special Providence in the fall of a sparrow . ' The organicity , the wholeness of life can not // be conceived of in any other terms . ' To be ' , said St Augustine , is no other than to be one , in so far , therefore , that anything attains unity , in so far , it is . ' The fundamental attributes of organicity and wholeness are coherence and absolute congruence with the essence of the whole organism . Without these there is only fragmentation and appearance without life . Essential entities change in appearance , but not in substance , and they retain their relationship with other entities and their place in the universe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' a certain type of structure organized for a certain end . ' This end is actualization . Any actualization contains the sufficient reasons for which this actualization is so , and these reasons can only be apprehended by imagination , and not by the understanding . Each individuation is internally determined , and yet has a phenomenal appearance of freedom . Therefore a thing , in the end , can only be what it is . ( This statement is neither verifiable nor refutable at the empirical level , though it is meaningful . ) Both history and thought unfold along a pattern which can only be known once it has been completed . Blind chance , hazard , random creativity , will produce nothing . There must be and there is a sufficient reason or cause for everything , and this cause carries its own finality or subjective aims which determine the affinities , assimilations and coherence of the whole thing . There is , of course , at the start a wide field of possibilities out of which actualizations take place . Whatever is not actualized has nevertheless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come into actualization if the forces or causes which rejected it disappear or are weakened enough for this to be possible . In that case , the new actualization will change its shape and therefore maintain in being forces contained in it which keep other non-actualized elements at bay . And this will go on and on , in a continuous process of change and interactions between being and non-being . Once a thing is , it remains an entity which plays a part in all realized entities . An essential thought or idea , that is to say a projection of true reality , lives on , through transformations , until the end of history and // time . Everything that is , is a manifestation or an actualization of an aspect of the original or primordial essence of Being , which can only be known through these various actualizations and their relationship with it . 3 Society , Religion and Being Creation does not of course proceed along one single line or narrow stream , but always , as it were , on a broad front or flood , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or aspects of life which grow , develop and decay , to be replaced by others . Any order which succeeds another necessarily carries with it the elements which have absorbed and replaced the former one , and marks therefore a progression towards a better capability for survival and greater complexity , and therefore a widening of the knowledge of the possibilities of creation . Although orders , societies , civilizations are not copies one from the other , they have characteristics shared by all which constitute the essential elements or laws of development of nature and of creation . There are therefore basic determining laws , and there are phenomenal aspects of these laws which change and decay according to contingencies , circumstances , organic transformations or the social and political problems of the society or epoch they are part of . The individuated entities of these societies or epochs select or retain what they need according to their inherent affinities and subjective aims , within a climate which may be favourable or unfavourable to them . Those to which the climate is favourable grow with it and manifest their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , retain their individuality and , proceeding as it were underground , dialectically absorb what is unfavourable or apparently opposed to them , and prepare the rejection of the order which does not enable them to manifest themselves // openly , and its replacement by an order which will evolve from the elements which are alien to it and which work actively for its rejection and for the establishment of the coincidence of appearance with substance or form . A society , though very disparate in composition , forms a whole , but not of course a whole like a human body which is an organic entity or integrated organism with a self-caused finality . A society is a composite whole , a space-time continuum of many magnetic fields harmonized by the epoch to which they belong , and this harmony includes melodies , fugues and counterpoints which at times may sound like cacophonous parts of the whole . There are moments when a society acts as a whole , that is to say moments when what could be called its true mind , its spirit or Zeitgeist emerges and calls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to survive , that is to say in order to maintain the dominant ethos or essence of this society , established by history and embodying the essential inheritance , traditions and aspirations which constitute the raison d'etre and finality of the society . These moments are rare , and the essential elements of a given society can only become part of the consciousness of this society in moments of crisis , when everyday preoccupations and phenomenality are suddenly reduced to the essence which in this case coincides with the preservation of the society which they have established . At this point it may come in conflict with the essence of other societies animated , as it is itself , with the essence to survive and to assert their dominance over this apparent conflict of orders . The process by which one society eliminates or replaces another is the same process by which an entity accepts or rejects the possible elements from which it actualizes itself . The elements which , in the end , would militate against organized developments of life and creation are discarded and , through trial and error @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ultimate essence of Being which is total self-knowledge . This does not imply a purely pragmatic morality based upon // success . It means , on the contrary , that every individuated entity , as well as every society , must seek out , with the utmost care , what its true essence is , and if it does so , it will necessarily discover that its true essence conforms with the true essence of Being , that it is growth and not destruction that matters , unless destruction tends towards growth , and that all elements which militate against it are slowly and finally eliminated , whether through their own violence or through organic processes , both being part of the dialectics of nature and creation . One must hasten to say that the violence of nature is not tinged with evil , that is to say it is spontaneous , natural or instinctive , without any consciousness of itself , and exists purely as part of a natural process of rise and fall , birth , death and rebirth , in order finally to reach pure Being . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself through time which enables actualizations to reach pure Being , and relegates the discarded possibilities to the realm of non-being . The passage from the infinite virtualities of pure Being or the matrix of things to determinations and individuations , takes place through forms . Out of Being 's infinite flow of virtualities , individuations take on appearances at diverse times and places , yet all are informed with the substance which gave them life . The domain of virtualities is the domain of being and not nonbeing . It is the continuum of Descartes from which life takes place , and it is life which creates non-being. - tfI'ime is part of Being , coeval with it , and is the becoming or process of growth through which creation returns to Being . Time , ' as Plato said , ' is the moving image of Eternity . ' Time is therefore the element in which eternal forms or essences take determined shapes and characters , and through the process of becoming , achieve the finality which is the search for the perfect form.1This finality is determined by the kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entities , contains . The greater and greater complexity of the entities involved rests upon the greater and greater harmonization of the basic structures which are precise and , with the exception of infinitesimally small par-D // tides ( the behaviour of which is only statistical ) , subject to unchanging mathematical laws . Creation is an ever more complex interplay of organisms , each with a strictly structurally-determined pattern , which not only repeat one another at various levels , but also interlock at various levels , in intricate , yet perfectly unmistakable , order . This order is the order of reason ( for unless it were reasonable , it would not be order ) which may yet contain elements of disorder or improbabilities . If it did not , Being would be entirely composed of positive aspects of things , and that would mean staticity and lack of movement , that is to say non-Being . Being contains all aspects of things , the positive and the negative figuring all possibilities of appearances capable of actualization . The essences contain all possibilities , to be moulded by time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ master or overall co-ordinator of disorder which is as necessary as night is necessary to day , bad to good , and finite to infinite . Any one of these opposites by itself would simply be a closed , uniform totality , that is to say nothingness or non-Being . The generation of our world came about from a combination of necessity with understanding , but understanding overrules necessity by persuading her to conduct the most part of the effects to the best issue . . . whence if a man would tell the tale of the making truly , he must bring the errant cause also into the story . ' ( Plato. ) 1 The rationality of the world supplies its final consolation , in virtue of which creativity passed from virtuality to being in Time in a world of relativeness . The rational , or the good , is the sustaining cause of all things . Good ' is used here in the sense of congruency to the original or essential structure of being . Each perfection reached through existence adds to the final harmony of Eternity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ philosopher from Hobbes to Locke , Kant and Hegel , thought that the rational was also the good . Kant sums them all up with the words : Reason will yet go to Nature not as a scholar who // only recites what his teacher wishes , but as a judge having authority who compels witnesses to answer the questions he puts to them . ' The world order is both rational and good , in the absolute ? it is men that are neither totally good nor totally rational , they are a mixture of both good and bad , rational and irrational , and therefore these ethical attributes are , on the human plane , relative values ' But whatsoever is the object of any man 's Appetite or Desire ; that is it , which he for his part calleth Good : And the object of his Hate , and Aversion , Evil ; and of his Contempt , Vile and Inconsiderable . For these words of Good , Evil , and Contemptible , are ever used with relation to the person that useth them : There being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Good and Evil , to be taken from the nature of the objects themselves ... ' 3 Eternity , Being , God , the Creator , like any other creator , makes himself through his work and only knows himself through his work . In all these cases the important elements are harmony , order , congruence with the whole , faithfulness to the inner structure and the finality of the work ; and of course what is aesthetically satisfying , what conforms to these above-mentioned canons , is also morally good , for the achievement of perfect harmony , the satisfying of the divine laws of music or the mathematics of Pythagoras and Plato , is also the realization of the primal aim of the creator . The unknowing to which we come in the end is , according to Eckhart , an unknowing beyond , not beneath knowing , so that rational explanation must go on being pushed to its furthest limits . Religion can not be dismissed as being merely an emotional feeling , an irrational urge to compensate for fears and mysteries which we can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rites in order to conjure away our terrors and to protect and comfort ourselves . This is a simplistic view , however powerful the mind which expounds it , be it that of Freud or that of the average scientist or of scientifically obsessed men who think that because they know that DNA gives the required instructions to the cells , they themselves can give in52 THE NECESSITY OF BEING structions to the DNA . Religion is a human need as vital as the sap to the tree , and those iconoclasts who demolish the churches and statues of the old faith do so in the name of science or adopt new ones which are , on the whole , far more dehumanized and destructive than the ones which they have repudiated . Materialism , deterministic or non-deterministic , Marxist or chance-ridden , scientism , fixation on objectivity and so-called scientific truths , these are the nourishing milk of all fanatics from Robespierre to St Just and other apostles of radical reforms , far more dangerous to man than the simple yet according to them fetish-ridden , love of Mother Teresa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and loves a humankind no doubt obtuse and superstitious in some cases , but more in need of affection and understanding than of scientific demystification . Religion is no doubt a feeling , a belief , and not a mathematically verifiable truth , but it is not irrational , it is part of reason , as seen by thinkers from Plato to Kant , Hegel , Kierkegaard , Jaspers , Maritain and Einstein , and it is the most basic human experience , that which has lifted man from all fours to the forked , standing-up position . It has helped him to walk , gazing upward , out of his dark , primordial caves to the cities where he now finds shelter and protection against the illnesses which once decimated mankind , and hopes for a better life . Whatever form it may take , religion determines our lives and shapes our characters and actions . Its concepts ' , as Whitehead put it , though derived primarily from special experience , are yet of universal validity , to be offered by faith to our ordering of all experiences . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put admirably the rationality and consequently the necessity of religion : Religion is an ultimate craving to infuse into the insistent particularity of emotion that non-temporal generality which primarily belongs to conceptual thought alone . In the higher organisms the differences of tempo between the mere emotions and the conceptual experiences produce a life-tedium , unless this supreme fusion has been effected . The two sides of // the organism require a reconciliation in which emotional experiences illustrate a conceptual justification , conceptual experiences find an emotional justification . ' This fusion can only be attempted by a religion which is rationally acceptable , or rather which is acceptable to reason . From Aquinas to Locke , Pascal , Bergson and Teilhard de Chardin , religious thinkers have tried to meet this requirement . The failure to effect such a reconciliation can only produce a divided sensibility , oscillating between total solipsism and destructive and lame rationalism on the one hand , and mystical emotionalism on the other , as was the case in the latter half of the nineteenth century . So thought and emotions were separated , thought coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind , turned into sentiments and sentimentality . Such a division of the human person precludes great art or a unified society capable of confronting its problems as a whole . Reason deprived of its metaphysical roots , its sense of the sacredness of the human personality , turns to self-worship. 4 Why Being ? How can one answer the question : why is there Being and what is Being ? One can not define Being a priori , because it obviously is not an entity , an object , a fact , determined , limited and bound . Whatever it is , it is not that , for if it were , it would be finite . Being is therefore neither definable , nor endowed with any attributes or characteristics which necessarily imply limitations . One can define its manifestations , its appearances , its phenomenal individuations , but not Being itself . Yet , since those things are , there must be a reason for their being ; if not , they would not be , and the reason , the cause of their being , must necessarily be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is one and only one aspect of characterization of Being which one can put forward , and that is that Being is necessary creativity . Having said this , one may ask why Being should be necessary . The reply is , I am afraid , merely tautological : that unless it were necessary , it would not be . Why it is so can not be explained , except by saying that without this character of necessity , there would be no creativity , and no creation . This character of necessity applied to Being and , therefore , to creation , does not by any stretch of the imagination mean absolutely predictable and individually guided determinism . Far from it . Creativity does not take place from one definite point , along an already traced line and towards a fixed end . Creativity takes place on a vast scale , without a definite , clear-cut beginning ; it takes place on a broad front , and with a simultaneity of // events which is neither linear nor circumscribed by a given place nor purely limited to the events @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hits and misses of creativity , its false starts , its dead ends , yet all within the context of necessity and as part of necessity . Whatever is endowed with insufficient positive essence , or whatever is merely virtuality , as a negative part of being , without sufficient essence and without a finality of its own , can nevertheless achieve a brief emergence in life , as a part of negativity and necessary non-being , but does not achieve true being , and consequently fails to become part of Being . If Being were absolutely perfect , omniscient , omni-present , complete in essence and existence , there could not be any creation . Being or God diminishes Himself through creation in order to complete Himself . God-made man restores to God the essence he has taken from Him , once it has been made , through God 's gift of grace , fit for Eternity . In Simone Weil 's words ( First and Last Notebooks , 1970 ) : Every man , seeing himself from the point of view of God the creator , should regard his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am God 's abdication . The more I exist , the more God abdicates . So if I take God 's side rather than my own I ought to regard my existence as a diminution , a decrease . ' The dogma which makes of God or Being a separate entity from creation is a logical impossibility . If God is complete , perfect , instead of completing and perfecting and knowing Himself , through creation , there is no possible explanation for creation and time . For the notion that either time or creation began at a certain time or moment , within Eternity , necessarily prompts the question : why did it take place at that chosen time and not at another ? And , if God as entity is separated from creation as entity , then where is the cause , where is the urge to create , why at a certain time and not at another , where were the materials for creation taken from , and where were they if they were separated from Being or from God , and if they were not , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begin to be activated for creation ? Such notions obviously // posit impossible dialectics between Time and Eternity , between Being and being , Creator and created , and they merely prompt the conclusion that these entities can not be separated the one from the other . Creation is inherent and necessary to Being , as Christ was , and is , necessary to God . These entities are inseparable , and in both cases the journey through time is the necessary part of the perfection of Being , which has to go through Time and existence in order to know itself or Himself absolutely both in positive and negative aspects . Christ is not therefore a means for God to redeem mankind , whose only original sin , if sin there is , is to have been created , but a means for God to know Himself through knowing what His creation knows through life , suffering and death , and , through being , to be partly known to His human creation which could only know Him or apprehend Him in this incarnation in human form . God could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , His creation , except through incarnation . He only knew the essence of being , and only knew Himself as essence , a knowledge which has to be completed through the actualization or existentialization of essence . In a similar way , man can only know God through the incarnation , or in rare moments of ineffable , mystical union with Him . Creation , like Christ , is part of the Eternal , which unfolds according to its inner laws , and not part of an act of choice or decision at a so-called moment of time , and for a given purpose . Being is becoming , and God or transcendence is immanent in creation and will be so until the process is completed by the total actualization of all the positive aspects of the possibilities and virtualities of creativity , intent upon actualization and existence through time , in order to go beyond time , to pure Being and Eternity . In the words of A. N. Whitehead : ' It is not the case that there is an actual world which accidentally happens to exhibit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there would be no world . ' Being and creation are one , just as God and creation are one , united by the same causation and the same finality . Creation is continuous change and separation of being // from non-being . What is transient , purely subjective , that is to say lacking in essence , becomes non-being ; what is , that is to say the true actualization of essence , is objectified and becomes part of Being or part of God 's eternal knowledge of Himself . Knowledge of essence is in fact pure self-knowledge , therefore ideal knowledge . Knowledge requires the realization of essence , the actualization of forms which reach the perfection which God knows , and by knowing it He knows Himself . What becomes eternal is what achieves perfection through Time . Thence the importance of Time , the present and existence . The laws which preside over the working of creation and the universe are unchanging , immutable , objective , if one uses this word in the sense of in-se ( in-itself ) , that is to say they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per-se ( or for-itself ) of being . Every being has or possesses an essential structure which has affinities with certain other essential structures of creation and of nature , and therefore is equipped to apprehend any one of them and to reveal it in its existential appearance which embodies the essential structure of both . It is not therefore a question of making , or strictly speaking of creating , something out of nothing or out of chaos , but of re-cognizing essential truths . The laws of nature are undeniably , by definition , objective , but the way the human being approaches them in order to discover them , or uses them once discovered , never is . Science always presupposes the existence of man , ' as Niels Bohr has said , and we must become conscious of the fact that we are not merely observers , but also actors on the stage of life . ' ' Each human being approaches and uses the laws of nature according to his own inner structure . These laws , verifiable by experiment , therefore objective in themselves , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workings of the human mind and of human affectivity , in its social or individual manifestations , in the aesthetic or in the ethical field . That could only be so if one accepted the widespread scientific , or one should rather say , pseudo-scientific , notion that there is nothing except being . I use the word pseudo-scientific to make // the point that if this notion were truly demonstrable and verifiable by experiment , then it would be truly scientific in the exact meaning of the term . As it is not possible that there should be nothing else , except being , without cause or finality , this is a merely pseudo-scientific notion which pertains to the domain of belief and dogmatics which some scientists hotly repudiate , and the existence of which they prefer to ignore . One can not think of being without Being , that is to say without movement from , and towards , Being . If being were thought of in isolation , it would be a static , self-contained , closed , monadic manifestation which would have to be self-caused and with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or pure and simply endless , and even these two absurd notions can not manage to exclude the notion of going beyond , and of transcendence , which is Being . If there were only being without Being , being would have to be self-caused and continuous , or be merely a brief and spontaneous emergence from non-Being to which it would be condemned to return in a state of eternal nothingness . So that , in fact , the source of the essence of being , or one could say the cause of being , would be nothingness , and its finality would also be nothingness ? a manifest absurdity , for nothingness is not-Being , and something which is the cause and finality of being can not be nothingness . Whatever one might say , and irrespective of any noble and stoic poses one might strike , the life of being in such conditions could only be totally nihilistic and dominated by a purely relativistic morality . This would be to ignore the longing for , and the sense of , the infinite which we know to have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Man has always felt that there is something more , something beyond himself , not his fears , his anxieties , but a mystery and a finality of which he is part and to which it is his categorical moral duty to contribute . This feeling of transcendence is , all in all , as much part of the structure of his mind and spirit as the life which he possesses and which he wishes to continue to possess for as long as // possible , unless he is too ill mentally or physically to wish for anything except the sleep of the womb . Life without such hopes , such beliefs , can only be a twilight life , the life of Marcus Aurelius , in a crumbling empire and city , a mysterious distant smile , among ruins , in a world without meaning or a sense of human brotherhood . In such cases , the singular and noble individual , whether he is Marcus Aurelius or Nietzsche , can manage to live on the verge of the void , and find in it enough exhilaration to sustain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noble life , though even his detachment from it , and the little importance he attaches to it , are , alas , taken up as examples by baser minds and empty hearts , in order to establish domination over their fellow beings or to treat them with disdain . Besides that , there is the fact that the continuous confrontation of being with nothingness , that is to say , the denial of past and future , compels life to be lived at the level of an intense and isolated subjectivism , that is to say without any possibility of intersubjectivity . But effects can not be used to explain causes , that is to say , one can not use the argument that being deprived of Being would make life entirely nihilistic and that this can not possibly be so , for if it were so , life would be absurd , stupid , cruel , etc . That would be an argument which , up to a point , would obviously be derived by analogy from the ontological argument . One must start from the facts , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could come about . The proof of the existence of the world , starting from the premise that Being or God could not be perfect unless it existed , obviously has no value for scientific thought . This kind of scholastic sophistry can indeed be rejected , though neither Leibnitz nor Kant did so without very serious cogitations . But the argument that since the world exists , there must necessarily be some cause for its existence , is not the ontological argument over again , and yet some scientists reject it on the same ground of unscientific lack of verifiability , using all sorts of simplistic , pejorative terms to explain their decisions . True , no scientific proof of 6o THE NECESSITY OF BEING the cause of the existence of Being can be given , except that there is being . Yet the scientists who reject Being are no more disinterested , no more detached or supposedly objective than those who believe in it . They are on the contrary just as biased , beliefridden , subjective , as anyone else ; the difference is that while everyone else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidently believe that they are truly objective . So we are back to the story of the Cretan liar . Do we lie when we know that we lie ? Are we objective when we think that we are objective ? Certainly not , since this thought is subjective , and since scientists are no more free from subjectivity than other men . Besides , the scientist 's worship of facts , his belief that to know is to be able to do , and that knowledge is necessarily good , or the basis of good and morality , coupled with a certain lack of imagination ( except , of course , in the case of the truly great scientists like Einstein and a few others ) , makes of the average scientist as poor a judge of morality and political or religious beliefs as the average human being , who has on the other hand the advantage of being less certain about the truth ? moral or religious ? and is therefore more likely to develop the necessary receptivity to encounter it . In order that there might be being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as the microscopic level , irrespective of some unpredictability in the behaviour of practically massless particles . From the dawn of philosophy to modern times the greatest thinkers have all thought so . Anaximander was , if not the first , one of the first to say so : ' The cause of the birth of all things is also the cause of their end , as it is just that it should be so , for they must make an end and expiate for their mutual injustice in the order of time . ' The whole of Greek thought , which played a vital part in Christianity , a part at least as important as that of Judaism , rests upon the supremacy of reason . Greek mysticism and idealism not only dominated the early centuries of Christianity , but they also retained their importance in the Augustinian synthesis // of Greek thought and Judaic existentialism . And it is above all Greek rationalism , with reason seen as both the organizational element of life and the basis of the search for the true understanding of things , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a large extent , of Western civilization . Neither the Judaic complex of guilt nor the Roman legalism and power structure could displace the pride and the dreams of reason which we have inherited from the Greeks . As everything has its obverse , it is also rationalism , or , to be precise , lame rationalism , one-eyed reason , as A. N. Whitehead put it , which is responsible for the attempted dethronement of reason in the Western world . Aquinas with his conviction that reason leads to faith , Kant with his faith in the supremacy of reason , Hegel with his bold Platonic assertion that the rational is the real , Leibnitz with his view that the world is rational , all insist upon the fact that the world is subject to order . Descartes says so repeatedly : The strength of the argument which I have used rests upon the fact that I know that it would not be possible for my nature to be what it is , that is to say , that I should have in myself the idea of God , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he claims that the idea of God is inherent in man . We could not , in fact , think of the absolute if we did not have some notion of the absolute in ourselves . Even Sartre has to concede that man 's basic desire is to be God ' .5 Yet is the idea , or the dream of a thing , or even its possible existence , enough to make this thing real ? Kant dealt with this argument ; it does not need to be repeated . The answer depends on what the thing or the notion dreamt of is . At first , it might look as if one posited the existence of a given thing because there was a universal desire for it . This of course is not enough ; beliefs change throughout history , and the belief in the need for the absolute , however widespread it may be , could change . The universal longing for an idea is not a proof of the reality or existence of this idea . Yet if being were purely contingent and had no relation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have any idea of transcendence . If I were absolutely independent , if I were the cause of my being . . . I should not lack any perfection whatsoever , for I should have given myself all those I have some idea about in myself , and then I should be God . ' ( Descartes. ) 9 Existent being is not therefore self-caused ; it is contingent and dependent upon immanence and transcendence . ' If God has imprinted the notion of Himself on every man , ' asks Descartes , ' how is it that men have such different notions of Him ? ' The fact is that God is part of creation and history , therefore , though His essence is part of man , He reveals himself progressively and differently to man , according to time and place , and above all according to the means which men have of apprehending Him . This is not , as some would have it , a merely anthropomorphic conception of God , it is that of a continuous relationship between Being or God and man , a relationship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bergson said : The nature of God will thus appear in the very reasons that one has for believing in His existence . ' Inspiration or grace can not blow at random ; it requires a certain state of receptivity . It certainly can not blow on Sartre , who declares that being is without reasons , without causes , without necessity ' .9 One wonders how a representative of such an irrational , chance-created breed can reach such would-be rational pronouncements , and by what magic he expects to have them accepted , since we are by his definition an absurd and useless passion on earth . Jean Rostand , a greater genius than Sartre , avoids Sartre 's aggressive atheism and , on the contrary , gives his own a touch of noble and controlled stoicism : Derisory atom , lost in the lifeless , infinite universe , man knows that his feverish activity is only a localized , ephemeral , insignificant , aimless phenomenon . He knows that his values are only valid for himself , and that from the point of view of the stars , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , matter no more than the destruction of an ant-heap caused by the footsteps of an absent-minded passer-by . Therefore . . . avoiding the sterile vertigo of the infinite , deaf to the // fearful silence of space , he will endeavour to become as uncosmic as the cosmos is inhuman ; fiercely turned in upon himself , he will devote himself humbly , earthily , humanly , to the accomplishment of his puny designs , to which he will devote the same seriousness as if they were intent on eternal ends . ' 10 More recently Jean Rostand has said , in an interview about Jacques Monod 's Le Hasard et la Necessite : In my opinion , however much I admire this book , it does not present any new philosophy . . . He seems to consider that the small changes that occur in the nucleic acids have been sufficient to achieve the whole of evolution from the first living creatures down to man . I myself think that some mechanisms exist of which we are as yet unaware . And let me make it clear that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and certainly no religious motive . Teilhard de Chardin would have answered you by saying : evolution is conducted by God Who will lead it to the omega . . . I simply have a feeling that something is missing in the interpreting mechanisms , something that is almost certainly of a physical or chemical nature ... ' ll But the atheism of Sartre , the stoicism of Rostand , the doubters of the perfect rationality of the world , are best answered by the greatest scientific genius since Newton ? Einstein . This is what he says : The infinite comprises all and controls all things . . . The structure of a system is the work of reason . . . The empirical data and their mutual relationships must find their representation in the conclusion of the design . It is the possibility of their representation which confers its only value and its only justification on the whole system and on the concepts and principles which form its basis . This apart , these concepts and these principles are free inventions of the human intellect , which can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by any form of a priori. ' 12 And : I am convinced that one can discover , thanks to purely mathematical constructions , the concepts and the laws linked one with the other , which give the key to natural phenomena ... No doubt , // experience remains the only criterion of the usefulness of a mathematical construction ; but the creative principle resides in mathematics . In a certain sense , I hold it as true that pure thought is capable of apprehending the real , as the ancients have dreamt that it was so . ' 13 One could not be more Platonist , more convinced of the importance of pure thought , mind , or imagination in apprehending or recognizing the real , which is the permanent . Progressively , ' Einstein continues , I came to the conclusion that it was impossible to discover true laws by starting from construction from known facts . ' Yet , that is what some scientists try to do , and with unforeseen results , particularly when they move from physics to metaphysics , from the particular to the general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relativity , Einstein says : The value of a theory does not rest upon its verification of small effects , but in a great simplification of the basis of physics as a whole ' , and he goes on : To understand why Nature is thus and not otherwise ; such is for a scientific mind the highest satisfaction . . . One feels that God Himself could not have organized these relations otherwise than what they are in fact , any more than it could be in His power to turn the figure 4 into a prime number . . . This is the Promethean element of scientific experience . . . it is , if I may say so , the religious basis of the scientific effort . " Einstein ' , said Max Born , ' had faith in the power of reason to discover the laws according to which God has constructed the universe . ' Planck , like Einstein , believed in causality and in the rational order of the world , and they believed that the physical world had a physical reality in space and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real world ' , said Planck , ' which exists independently of man 's act of knowledge , and the real external world is not knowable directly . ' Einstein also posited ' the existence of a real universe which liberates the universe from the thinking and apprehending subject . The positivists think that they can do without it ; this seems to me an illusion , unless they want to renounce thought itself . ' Thought is therefore only possible if one posits the existence of a true reality , free from // the thinking subject ; we are back to Plato with his ideal world which was also the real , and mind to apprehend it . The notion of the absurd , so widely entertained in our time , is either a relative , idealistic notion or , if it is an absolute , it necessarily predicates the total incompetence of the one who pronounces about it , since the one who does so is part of it . For if there is only the absurd , then the absurd is all , including the subject who predicates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then the subject who posits it must not only be conscious of perfect rationality and order , but also situate the absurd within the structure of order and rationality which must obviously be the whole , or at least the dominant aspect of human life , to which the absurd belongs . If the absurd were dominant , it would be most unlikely that the greatest geniuses , the Greek artists , Shakespeare , Dante and others , should not have stressed this aspect of life , the absurd , instead of the rationality , the growth of human experience , and order . This would of course be a denial of the universality of the strength of their genius which , if it had concentrated on purely sectional and limited aspects of the life of man ? absurdity being one of them ? to the detriment of the whole , or a section not integrated in the whole , could only have been very limited in scope and significance ; and of course , it is not . Whatever the significant character in any one of the works of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his freedom and behaviour are part of the divine or universal rationality and justice which , in the end , must prevail , and whose triumph is always part of the final impres sion conveyed by these works . Lear 's decision to renounce his throne is not absurd ; it is unexplained , but it is neither un motivated nor inhuman . Power can tire , or one may want to test the will of those who support it , or even require reassur ances . Lear 's daughters ' behaviour is not absurd , but unnatural , that is to say irrational , purely instinctive and self-centred . Being can neither be reconciled with any notion of a totally absurd creation , nor leave room for choice , because choice implies separation between Being and the various entities from // which it would choose , and varying degrees of knowledge of those aspects of creativity . This is not possible , for Being 's knowledge is neither graded nor gradual , it is constantly perfect at the level of essences . Being is self-knowing both at the level of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actualization is the necessary realization of Being , that is to say of what is pure Being shorn from non-Being . Being is both transcendent and immanent . It is transcendent in the sense that its reality informs creation and the cosmos ; it is immanent in the sense that it informs the actualization of some of the virtualities which pertain to being . These virtualities are actualized , not through a continuous particular will or guiding force , but according to their essences which are more or less sufficient for total or partial actualization . Thus some actualizations succeed and others fail , for there are many virtualities which are wanting in essence and therefore are not actualized . There is order , but it is not the order of a mobile placed in a groove from which it can not swerve and in which it can not stop . It is the order of a general purpose which is the actualization of Being , the order of a river which necessarily flows downward , but the waters of which can overflow its banks , spread out over marshy ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order along a broad direction , with the possibility of trial and error . Some small streams become rivers , which connect with still greater rivers and reach the sea . Others start , but get lost on the way , in the same way as in a forest , many seeds fall to the ground , but only a few begin to grow , and among these few many will stop half-way because they are crushed by other plants , by the elements or by other forces . It is the same with the various virtualities of Being . Many are eliminated , but the orientation of Being and its order of unfolding are unperturbed and , in fact , the force which activates this order presides over the elimination of the various useless virtualities and only fosters those which are truly part of the essence of positive actualization . Being is aware , at any time , of all the virtualities of any substance or essence . Each essence , substance or form // is a whole with its special structural connections with the structure of the universe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This essence or substance is part of and is connected with the essence of Being , and therefore part of the unfolding of Being . Each essence actualizes perfectly or partially a given aspect of essential , eternal truth , and it retains the knowledge or selfawareness of this truth , as part of the true reality of Being . This self-awareness necessarily re-cognizes , through Being , the self-awareness of the parts of the truth which are close to , or have affinities with itself , and are therefore part of the same awareness , or of an awareness which is close to it , within Being . Each individuated essence contains all the virtualities which may or may not be actualized in the contingent world . But the fact that nothing can happen which is not inherent to the essence of the individuation , does not mean that there is an iron order which foretells or precludes any swerving , hesitations , or any contingent , superficial intervention . That the end is in the beginning , that God , or Being , can see the way in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean that essence or substance , actualizing itself in Time , has only one single , uniform way of doing so , within a strictly enforced and fully determining fate . God or Being can see or know the end or finality of every essence , but the individuated essence does not know its end until it has achieved it , and therefore it follows a pattern of trial and error towards its finality which is the final discovery of itself through actualization . The fact that certain possibilities and virtualities are rejected does not mean that they could not come to exist , or that it was impossible for them to be actualized . It means that what has been actualized was neither , strictly speaking , absolutely necessary , nor ineluctably determined . Nevertheless the fact that it has been actualized proves that there were in it the virtualities which corresponded best to the essence which was seeking its perfection through actualization . So that , in the end , one is faced with the fact that there is an appearance of free-will , of // interplay of chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but this is merely an appearance , from the point of view of transcendence or of true knowledge of the exact strength of the component elements of any given essence , for it is the inner composition of these elements which determines the way its possibilities and virtualities will reach or not reach actualization . Every essence not only includes the virtualities of its actualization , but is related both to other essences by continuous possibilities and virtualities which make interaction and structural relations with other essences possible , and to Being as part of an overall pattern , which determines the structural affinities and finality of all individuated essences . The fact that individuated essences are both finite in their existential actualizations , and infinite in as far as they achieve the perfection of their truth , is what relates them to Being . This means that an individuated essence could be in conflict with other individuated essences on the contingent plane , and remain incomplete , and therefore unable to harmonize with the essential structure to which it is destined , though it might be able to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But this contribution , whatever it is , is nevertheless part of Being 's purpose , to reach absolute self-knowledge through actualization which is the only way of separating being from non-being . The essence of any individuation contains the forms or ideas of things which enable it to re-cognize these things , or rather the truth of these things . Without these forms or ideas as parts of essence , there would be no means of apprehending the truth of their phenomenal appearance . The world is perceived according to the ideas and forms that we possess of it . This does not mean that the phenomenal world only exists through the perceiving subject , in Berkeleyan fashion ; it means that the perceiving subject possesses , in himself as part of his essence , or rather , every individual possesses in varying degrees , the forms , the ideas which will enable him to apprehend the truth of certain things . Nor is it // a question of remembering past lives . It is a question of forms , of individuated essences being the same as , or being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world ? all parts of the same source , therefore , part of Being . Evil and Suffering Soyez beni , mon Dieu , qui donnez la souffrance Comme un divin remede a nos impuretes . BAUDELAIRE There are here two problems which have exercised man 's mind through the ages . There is , first , the one concerning the fact that the force of any individuated essence determines , or seems to determine , the existential shape which the individuation will have . This would seem to submit all aspects of life to a very rigid determinism ; yet it is not so , for , as explained previously , the will to exist operating within a large number of virtualities and possibilities is not necessarily compelled to choose one single given virtuality , though it obviously chooses between what is absolutely best and what is possible . One must bear in mind the fact that the best is not necessarily always possible and in all places . That would be to say that one single essence unfolding by itself , on its own , would necessarily choose the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were equipped with all the possibilities from which to choose its perfection . But one must not forget that possibilities necessarily imply impossibilities , and perfection implies imperfection . Still , it is possible to think ( if this concept were possible , which it is not ) that one essence in isolation would achieve its best possible actualization , purely according to its own form . But essences always operate with other individuated essences , each seeking actualization , therefore one has to take into account not only the inherent contradictions existing in every individuated essence , but also the contradictions which every EVIL AND SUFFERING 7r individuated essence constitutes for the others . This , of course , increases the margin of uncertainty about the actualization of certain possibilities , without in any way being able to alter the fundamental relationship of all individuated essences to Being . Being knows what will be , or rather , this is not the way to put it , for the expression what will be ' applied to Being is meaningless . Being simply is , and is one and eternally the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through existence and Time is merely a notion apprehended as extension by the finite mind , while it is apprehended as an eternalized instant by Being itself . Therefore if Being knows what will be through Time , whatever is through Time is from the point of view of Being ineluctable and necessary , and this is truly so , for actualization is either absolutely necessary to its becoming , or it is the prey of chance and individuated free will . That would not be Being , but chaos , from which Being would be supposed to emerge and to make itself . Being itself has obviously freely chosen what it is , but freely ' here can only be equated with necessarily ' , for Being , all knowing , could only choose the best and nothing else . Freedom is therefore only an appearance in the finite world of Time ? the domain of the actualization of the infinite possibilities of essence . These possibilities are infinite for man 's mind , but they are not so for Being which knows them all , including their negative and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the evil behaviour of Judas was as much a revelation to his fellow apostles and to his time , as Hitler 's evil behaviour was to the twentieth century . But neither sample of evil behaviour could be said to be a revelation to Being , which knew , at the level of essence , what these actualizations would be . Judas was part of the same timeless necessity which presided over Christ 's incarnation , and this goes back to creation itself and to the very first man , for without creation which is finite , and therefore imperfect , there could not have been any ignorance or any need to enlighten men about the true way to perfection , or any other way for Being to know itself through His incarnation // and death in Time . Death , the disintegration of an organic individuation , would have been unknown to Being except at the level of essence , that is to say except as virtuality , that is to say as part of a state of perpetual equilibrium between Being and non-Being , transparent , bottomless , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ void , without the slightest cloud or sound ? a perfection of a kind , certainly , but a perfection which could not possibly know itself , since nothing can only reflect nothing . Thence the need to know itself through extension , actualization and the impurities and imperfections of creation which , as previously mentioned , constantly and endlessly sieves being from non-being . This continuous process of sieving being from non-being necessarily entails the actualization of the positive and the negative , and of what one calls in human terms the good and the bad . The process , part of the necessity and knowledge of Being , takes place within the perspective of Being , and is a purely natural and totally non-anthropomorphous process . The epithets good and bad , or good and evil , have absolutely no meaning within it . These actions and transformations are what is absolutely necessary and ineluctable in the actualization of Being , which can not be implicated in human terminology , or weighed by human tribunals and saddled with human responsibilities . These things are , and their final meaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the finite mind , and should not be used as a means to shift man 's own responsibilities on to the Absolute , or to blame it for the evil ' of mankind . Transcendence can not be assessed by the finite , and it is only involved in the finite through immanence . Evil , crime and other failings are part of the ways of men and can not be given metaphysical roots , or sanctions , except in as far as they reflect a loss of sense of direction , or a lack of true relationship between man and man ? something which implies a lack of true relationship with Being . To say that Evil is necessarily part of the actualization of essence in Time neither implicates nor involves the responsibility of Being . One has therefore to judge evil , the // good and the bad , on the human plane and simply see what one can make of them , without any metaphysical implications , or notions of original sin . The Dostoyevskian notion that without God everything is permitted is , to my mind , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impossibility of reconciling God 's omnipotence and omniscience with evil obviously rests upon a rather superficial notion of God as an all-controlling , alldirecting and supervising power . It is a notion that reduces God either to a pantheistic divinity or to an ever-proliferating Manichean entity producing as many angels or demons as there are individuals on earth or on any inhabited planets in the universe . This is not therefore the notion of God as the substance or informing force of life , but of God as an absolute dictator or ever-present , ever-interfering Big Brother . It is a notion that can be entertained not on the plane of reason but only on the plane of simplified , utilitarian theology , or on that of animism , as in the case of primitive societies . The only rational notion of God which makes possible some kind of freedom , the nature of which will be briefly examined later , is that of God as informing being in Time , its essence realizing itself to the best of its positive potentialities , and by so doing , contributing through such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the completion of the self-knowledge and perfection of Being . Plato , in the Thaetetus , had already suggested that men participate in the knowledge of God 's eternity , through contemplation ' . It is not possible to conceive of Being as constantly intervening to modify the evolution and the actualizations of individuated essence . This would be contrary to the notion of the ideally perfect knowledge possessed by Being , which would thus be constantly altered by contingencies instead of constantly accommodating or assimilating them to fit the self-contained , immutable finality of the essence which informs individuated being and connects it with Being . On the biological plane it would mean that life is either constantly tossed about by // chance mutations due to all sorts of causes , or has to be guided by a force which must be forever on the look-out to keep it , through constant interventions , on its pre-set track ; while , on the contrary , life unfolds according to the affinities and properties of the elements which compose the chemical aggregates and the biological molecules , the self-caused finality of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the inner logic and purpose of an evolutionary creation . On the metaphysical plane , evolution takes place according to the appetites and affinities of the individuated essences , and according to their positive virtualities for full being , or their lack of positive virtualities which are annihilated into nothingness , which , on the plane of history and organized social life , corresponds to the basic notion of Evil . Evil is therefore a lack of being , that is to say an incapacity , due to certain limitations of individuated essence , to become fully conscious of true being , part of Being . An existent may , owing to such limitations , think or believe that goodness consists entirely in satisfying his desires and longings , irrespective of the effect that such an attitude or such behaviour may have on others ; he may believe that his freedom consists in the fulfilment of his own self-interests and desires ; yet , in fact , this is not fulfilment , but slavery as far as he is concerned , and it is oppression and tyranny as far as his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the existent who behaves according to such rules lacks sufficient positive essence to enable him to transcend his own limitations and self-interest , and to connect with the true essence of Being , which necessarily posits goodness as part of its perfection . Goodness consists not in trying to achieve the fulfilment of one 's own desires ? something which is in fact non-fulfilment and non-being ? but the fulfilment of all the aspects of life which tend to reunite being with Being . This can only be done by endeavouring to liberate the existent from the servitude of his self-centred appetites , which are far more tyrannical than any external tyranny , and by his thinking and behaving in such a way that whatever he does or thinks could always be // universalized without causing any suffering or any diminution of being to other existents . This is the only way to achieve freedom , or to make freedom possible , and this freedom rests upon the Kantian and Christian notion of making it possible for the individual self to conform to the Law , or to merge into true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self , whatever the limitations of his essence , must try to know what true being really is . The innate limitations of individuated essence obviously connect with the intractable problem of responsibility for evil in society , and with the various ways of dealing with it . My view is that innate limitations of essence do not preclude either attempts to acquire or to develop , through individual effort and through support from others , a vague consciousness of evil , or the adoption by society of institutions which minister to these failings and needs , and also of measures to prevent or even to make impossible the repetition of certain manifestations of evil once they have taken place . These efforts to live with evil ought to be carried out in a spirit of compassion and brotherhood towards those who are less endowed than others , and a desire by those who know the truth and the experience of freedom to help as much as possible those who , through essential limitations , are deprived of them . The New Testament says : ' Ye shall know the truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To know the truth is to know the true nature of being , and in the end , freedom is not a question of examining and weighing various hypothetical alternatives as if they were objects laid out upon an imaginary table , but of trying to discover , out of the various forces pressing confusedly upon the mind and the heart , the light which could guide one to an apprehension of the true nature of being . Once this apprehension has been achieved , either through conscious efforts and a shedding of egotistical impediments , or through unexpected moments of surrender and illumination , enlightenment and freedom may come . Man 's freedom does not depend on the existence or non-exist76 THE NECESSITY OF BEING ence of God as a rewarding or chastising hand ; it depends on his capacity to discover through his conscience , which is the light that connects him with Being , what he ought to think or do in order to harmonize his life so as to contribute to the maximum goodness and to the spiritual well-being of mankind through the actualizations of all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into non-being of what is fit neither for being nor for Being , neither for Time nor for Eternity , for in the end it is through Time that Eternity makes itself . One must cease trying to enclose God in the all too facile and impossible dilemma between omnipotence and guilt , and a limitation of power fit only for Manicheism or polytheism . These are purely anthropomorphic notions which can not be applied to Being , and it is because most theologies have personalized God that they have never been able to solve the problem of evil . Being certainly knows everything as essence , but knowledge as essence is not the same thing as knowledge through existence , or through incarnation and the continuous activity of the Holy Spirit . Knowledge as essence is ideally perfect , since it is knowledge of knowledge , and it is by definition unaware of any flaws , imperfections or absences , which can only reveal themselves through individuations which actualize in Time all the positive virtualities of their essence , and thus contribute through objectification to the absolute self-knowledge and perfection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsibility on to a present or absent God , he can even less base his morality on so-called objective knowledge acquired through science . The knowledge of true being , which is the basis of freedom and morality , has very little to do with the perceptual , physical , biological or sociological knowledge which is advocated as a possible basis of the ethics of knowledge by some scientists . This notion is , in principle , as subjective and as dogmatic as any of those aspects of religious belief which scientists reject as meaningless and unverifiable . To be sure , objectivity is only a dream , and even the greatest living philosopher of science , Karl Popper , says // practically as much in his book , Conjectures and Refutations . Scientific knowledge , as a whole , is neither ethical nor unethical ; it is neutral ; like Aesop 's tongue , it depends upon the use one puts it to ? it can be good , and it can be bad . Scientific knowledge certainly can confer material power upon those who possess it or produce it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On the plane of the spirit , St Francis , shorn of all his material possessions , yet overflowing with hope , love and compassion for his fellow-beings , or Socrates , ready to die for his faith in truth and immortality , are far more powerful and of greater import for mankind than Von Braun , maker of rockets that may go to the moon or be used as terrifying instruments of destruction . In bacteriologists like Pasteur or Fleming there is only good , but it is a different problem to have brilliant bacteriologists all over the world devoting ( so they think ) their knowledge to the preparation of the impossibility of bacteriological warfare . This kind of patriotic sophistry , which ought to be alien to the true scientific spirit , is at the mercy of any apprentice sorcerer who , like Hitler , could compel them or prevail upon them to put the products of their knowledge to the service of his destructive power . Yet perhaps the worst feature of this dream of an ethics of knowledge is that this kind of knowledge could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? who would necessarily be the priests of the new morality . The notion that one could make of so-called objective , scientific knowledge the basis of ethics is so fraught with difficulties that even Professor Monod , one of its best-known sponsors , finds it difficult to avoid some self-contradiction . For instance , he says : The very definition of true knowledge rests , in the last analysis , on a postulate which belongs to ethics . ' On the next page he says : Knowledge in itself excludes any kind of value judgments ( except those which have an epistemological value ) , while ethics which is by nature non-objective is for ever excluded from the field of knowledge . ' The second statement is intrinsically more acceptable than the first , but it // would seem rather to contradict the first . Indeed , knowledge is above all concerned with truth and not with ethical values ; and besides , it is difficult to see how one could assess the value of the ethical postulate which is the basis of knowledge , since knowledge itself is supposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ethics . We are back to the chicken and the egg , and we are in the end faced with the subjective choice of a basic value which rests not on knowledge but on belief . Truth as a universal is , of course , an ethical value as much as beauty and goodness ; but with the word universal ' we are in the domain of philosophy and not the domain of science . We are in the domain of Keats 's Beauty is truth , truth beauty ' , where Dostoyevsky 's wish that one day beauty might save the world ' might come true . In this domain , for those who do not base ethics on the search for the true being as perfect goodness , or on the Kantian categorical imperative , the problem consists in distinguishing the true from the false and the good from the bad , either according to purely human standards or by giving them a transcendental substratum , which has , in various forms , always been part of man 's perennial thought . Although he describes man as alone in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emerged by chance ' , ' Professor Monod can not define the notion of the ethics of knowledge without bringing in the notion of transcendence : The ethics of knowledge . . . implies a transcendent value ? true knowledge ? and proposes to man not to make use of it , but henceforth , through a deliberate and conscious choice , to serve it . It is , however , also a humanism , for it respects in man the creator and the depository of this transcendence . " So man , having originated from blind , absolute chance ? the basis of evolution ? creates transcendence or transcendental values . Therefore , although there is no room for God or transcendence , there is obviously room for a chosen few ( scientists or others ) who know what true knowledge is , and who are the depositories of transcendental values and recondite axioms which can endlessly tease the layman 's imagination . Take , for // instance , this one : ' The ethics of knowledge is equally , in a certain sense , knowledge of ethics . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the temple of the divinity called knowledge ; mysterious like the sphinx 's smile , a closed circle like the image of the Egyptian serpent that bites its own tail ! But it is difficult to know the exact nature of the ethics here suggested , for the knowledge upon which it is based excludes , in principle , the subjective aspects of human life which ? from love of mankind and love of beauty to the questionings and dreams about man 's origins , nature and finality ? can not be encompassed by science . The duty to know , in the sense of knowing history , sociology and the laws of nature , etc. , obviously can not constitute an ethics of knowledge . The only knowledge basic to ethics is the knowledge of true being or true love , which is the substance or the force which holds all men together in an I-and-thou relationship which extends to and embraces the divinity . The notion that existence is a manifestation of Being , and therefore dependent upon its laws , neither diminishes the role of the human personality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deterministic , predictable world . As previously pointed out , determinism at the existential level is no more predictable than free will . It simply means that everything in creation is inherently and coherently related to causes , part of the becoming of Being , instead of being self-caused as free will ought , in principle , to be . Such a notion can not be seriously entertained either as a metaphysical or , least of all , as a phenomenal notion . The notion of man choosing his decisions and through them making himself , in a constant state of Promethean defiance of causal limitations or ontological fears , is a noble one , but it is , alas , difficult to uphold . In fact , unless the notion of man 's freedom is removed from this idealistic , abstract plane and brought down to the plane of exact knowledge of the existential , social conventions , laws and regulations , and put together with an accurate self-knowledge or consciousness of the workings of man 's mind and emotions , it remains only a verbal game So THE NECESSITY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ autocrats in order to control or to terrify their fellow beings . It can reasonably be argued that in fact we do not make our choices , for we can not separate the choosing I from the chosen attitude or decision ; we can not , indeed , turn the hypothetical choosing I into an ever newly minted entity as virgin of any marks or imprints of time and life as the primal dawn . The dice are loaded , the I is trailing with it a whole nexus of causal entanglements with past events and future hopes which make any truly free choice impossible . All that the choosing I can do is not to choose but to know what its choices are , and through its choices and actions to know what it truly is . The attitudes or alternatives towards which we seem to be directing our attention ? that is to say , the attention of an hypothetical entity called the I ? are those which are uppermost in our minds as dominant yet unrevealed elements of our psyche . Our so-called choices are in fact the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with which they fuse to become the unfolding pattern of our personality . This per-sonality is not curtailed by being looked upon as causally con-nected with the becoming of Being . A morality which rests upon the true knowledge of being and upon the categorical duty to bring about the actualization of God 's will as universal good-ness and love , precludes egoism or retributory attitudes towards human failings , and advocates reformatory and preventive measures which are not very different from those proposed by the believers in free will . Such a morality is based upon the concept that if men are normal , they are rational , and as such it is their duty and responsibility to endeavour to conform to the logos or reason which is God 's will . God has written neither the exact meaning nor the end of creation in creation itself ; but the essence which informs creation , which compels it to be what it is , is a purposive energy , and as such it contains the virtualities of its unfolding and end . If man , according to Marxism , makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he makes it , not as if he were a selfEVIL // created entity , continuously possessed with free-will , but as part and parcel of a continuously evolving creation , that is to say as part of a whole which has a purpose of which man is part , and which he progressively reveals . Creation makes itself and reveals itself progressively according to various successive stages of development , and according to the forces and the places involved . These developments , though not predetermined in the sense that an omnipotent power has decided in advance what will take place , are nevertheless determined by , or rather caused by , the state of the forces or elements which compose them . Some forces may appear as strong and uppermost at certain moments , and in certain places ; some beliefs may appear as firmly held and widespread , and yet they may not be the dominant element of the evolutive process of creation ; there-fore they will soon be absorbed in others , or discarded , and they will not play much of a part in the process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it is rotten to the core , a tree may look as if it were set to live for centuries ; yet it will collapse at the first storm . The tree could not know of its coming fall , although man could discover it if he happened to examine it . Nothing existing can know the scope and span of essence . Only essence itself could have this knowledge , and essence can only know itself through existence , therefore essence itself does not know its final form , since essence is in itself an orientation to-wards a plenitude which it seeks to achieve and know through existence . Only Being , as entity separated from essence at work in creation , could know the finality of essence and creation ; but that would mean conceiving of Being as the unmoved mover of creation , made of chaos or non-Being , a notion which is untenable , for it would make Being finite , and therefore an object and not the subject of becoming . Evil and suffering are part of becoming ; they are so , not as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process of change , the finality of which is spirit . Evil lies in the naturally destructive character of things , each struggling for the realiza82 THE NECESSITY OF BEING tion of its own essence . The phenomenal ascendancy and apparent importance of a given thing or object is no indication of its true essential worth . A field of completely scentless flowers might , from the point of view of worth , be far less valuable than a single rose . A given aspect of social life might seem important , and yet be totally valueless and insignificant , while another aspect , not showing any striking signs of importance at the phenomenal level , might have deep roots which profoundly affect life and which will go on affecting and transforming life increasingly in the future . Here lies the difference between fashion and truth . Evil is part of the conflict of opposites , unavoidable and contingent to the final aim of the lastingness and permanence of good . Evil is negative , therefore it will be eliminated from the permanent aim of Being , which is totally positive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of good and unfolding of creativity . Evil is suffering and deprivation of life by beings who , by definition , can not give back life ; therefore killing , whatever form it may take , legal , patriotic , or otherwise , is always , in varying degrees , evil . To suffer evil is the only way to defeat it . Suffering , whether redemptory or as means of purgation , is part of life and has great heuristic value , but its redemptory aspect can not be accepted as being part of Christ 's mission on earth . Suffering can , no doubt , be enlightening ; yet it must not be overwhelming , and it is nevertheless part of the evil which plagues mankind . Evil being a necessary part of finitude , it is unthinkable that Christ should have come to earth to redeem evil through suffering and death . Suffering , as the Book of Job proves , can be a means of opening up and raising the individual to the knowledge and the apprehension of God and higher truth . But , in order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tempt Job . Suffering is a means of truly understanding and sharing in the plight of the human condition . St Augustine 's etiam peccata certainly indicates that he sees evil as a means to learn and to reach the supreme good . It stands to reason that evil is part of immanence and part of the // imperfection of beings , which can not by definition possess the perfection of Being . Plato said : ' Nobody is evil of his own free will . ' Will is a matter of knowledge , that is to say , of knowing what one wants to do . The knowledge of what one wants to do is the prerequisite of the will to act . The will , that is to say the motive force of action , is the knowledge of the action which one wishes to perform . Will does not mediate between the pros and cons and the varied aspects of a given problem , weighing one against the other . Will is the motive for acting emerging as the dominant aspect of a given situation , the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prominent aspect which motivates the individual to act . The robber knows what he wants , and the way to obtain it , but his consciousness does not include in this knowledge , except in a soon-discarded or inchoate form , the moral values of his action , and the various risks he might incur ; at least it does not include them in a way which could be strong enough to eliminate the other aspects of his projected action and consequently preclude it . Nobody willingly causes suffering unless he is a sadist , that is to say unless he does so as part of the negative aspect and imperfection of his essence . Yet numerous social systems of mankind cause evil , and ignore suffering , and it must be said that for too long religion has partly comforted itself with the thought that those who suffer on earth will be redeemed and rewarded in Heaven . Suffering transcended can be , and is , ennobling and a credit to man in his puny fight against his fate and against his limitations ; but long , protracted suffering , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man to rise above it , is degrading and unworthy of the human condition , and certainly unworthy of transcendence , for those who believe that transcendence could have any part whatsoever in it . Evil and suffering are part of the necessary harmony of pure Being which can only be reached through the resolution of opposites and of the negative aspects of creation . Whitehead writes in Religion and the Modern World : ' What is the way of // value is the attainment of life . And it can not find such value till it has changed its individual claim with that of the objective universe . Religion is world 's loyalty . ' s This means that the individual must assume responsibility towards others and the world , and must merge his individuality with the universal or divine order , for , as Dante put it , only in sua voluntade e nostra pace . This also rejoins the categorical imperative of Kant ; it merges the individual interest in the general good , and the logos or God is the mediating element through which one must pass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This transformation can not take place in any other way . To pass from the individual to the universal and perennial , a mediator , a point of reference , is necessary . In that respect , the incarnation is the crux , the burning point of reference and the means by which it is possible to ascertain the value which every individuation and actualization has in relation to Being and Eternity . Religion gives man what nothing else can give him ? a perspective of events and a pattern to follow , so as to reach the universal through the present and existence . 6 Christ and Socrates In our anthropomorphic age , in which God has been proclaimed dead by Nietzsche and Being is without reason , without cause and without necessity ' , ' man is a useless passion ' and life is looked upon as absurd . Men , deprived of God , nevertheless aspire to be God ' , would like to know everything , and dismiss what is beyond their knowledge as irrational . They ignore the fact that knowledge is always subjective , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absolute can not be known , though it is an intelligible concept of pure reason . God is , by definition , incomprehensible ; if He were not so , He would not be God , but a mathematical truth . Besides , from the Hebrews who , in Deuteronomy , told their God that His presence was too terrifying , to the Hindus , the Greeks and others , the absolute or the Divine has always to be mediated through avatars or incarnations . The Socratic moral imperative : Know thyself ' , which echoes Apollo 's command , simply means : know thyself as a man among men , know what you are ? a finite being who can only reach the supreme truth through death . God took human shape so that men might know His truth through Christ , but His incarnation meant death . Both Socrates and Christ testify to the fact that there can not be any profound human knowledge or revelation of ontological truth without suffering and death . Socrates and Christ illustrate , each in his own way , the same crucial need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that life is necessarily tragic , and that it is through the acceptance of this truth , and not through any crude materialism or // superficial notions of absurdity , that man can be filled with concern for the other , who is a brother and not an enemy . Life is tragic , and has always been so , since the dawn of human consciousness which taught man his finitude and his everimpending death . Life is but a tale told by an idiot , full of sound and fury , signifying nothing ' : this is merely the last cry of a thwarted , ambitious man on the verge of the void , of which he is terrifyingly conscious . Life is King Lear 's noble acceptance of blindness , destitution and human sorrows , with the words : Ripeness is all . ' Life is what blind , heart-wracked Oedipus Colonus describes with his last words : In spite of so many trials , my advanced age and the greatness of my soul , make me say that all is well . ' Tragedy ' , said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the satisfaction of the mind . The necessity of what befalls individuals is only made clear when it emerges as absolute reason , which then morally calms the soul thrown into turmoil by the fate of the tragic hero , but finally appeased . ' In my beginning is my end ' , said T. S. Eliot . In my end is my beginning ' , said Mary Stuart . We are born to die , and death is a new beginning , a beginning without end . Socrates and Christ , the one interpreted by Plato , the other by St Paul , form the two basic roots of the tree of Western civilization . Neither of them wrote down what he said to men . They both confined themselves to speech and to action , and there is the vital lesson , the lesson valid for religion as well as for morality ? that life is above all action . They were both misunderstood , and they both based the authority of their philosophy not on any form of mandarinism , but on the life and the reactions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were humble men , and Socrates tested the truth of his philosophy not on sophists , whom he despised , but on artisans . For Socrates immortality was an adventure , a leap into faith , and not a certainty . That is why , beyond the centuries , he links up with Pascal and Kierkegaard . Christ knew his mission ; he was sure of his Father 's love and his return to Him , and yet at the last moment he could not help expressing his // horror of suffering and death with the words : My God , my God , why hast Thou forsaken me ? ' Did this cry express the existential aspect of the Jewish faith , that is to say a faith in which the body and the present were important , while the Greeks , though they lived with all their senses and worshipped the body while it lasted , looked upon them as unimportant and as a mere reflection of the ideal world ? Perhaps . Besides numerous gods and goddesses , Greek thought posits the existence of an abstract mind or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which phenomenal reality is related and by which it is assessed , or rather given its values . Thought itself is objective , and the absolute mind or Idea pervades the universe as a kind of vast continuum of which all created things , including the gods , are part . The world is nothing else but the absolute idea reflecting itself upon phenomenal reality which is the becoming of the absolute . The absolute and phenomenal reality are connected by noun or logos . Knowledge is not individual ; it can only be real if it is related to the essences or to the idea which knows itself as totality . Christ 's incarnation indicates that the Absolute or Being has to be actualized in order to know itself fully , to be known by its individuations and to enable them to participate in the full accomplishment of its creativity . With the Greeks , the soul must be satisfied not through flights into non-being or Nirvana , as in Hindu philosophy , but in itself , by obeying the laws which preside over the equilibrium of the life of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precursor of Plato , conceived of the absolute as process or becoming . Being is therefore the first principle , becoming is the second ? the logos , the creativity which causes actualization through existence , and thus fulfilment of the essence of Being . In the world of Socrates , there were the laws ? divine and human laws ? and gods and goddesses , and ideas ( Beauty , Justice , etc. ) which were supposed to be eternal and true . With Socrates , truth can no longer be accepted as a reflection of the absolute ; it must be mediated by thought in existence . The // tragedy of Socrates is the most moving after that of Christ , or perhaps even more so , for while the rabbis and the Romans might have looked upon Christ as a rebel , an agitator or an impostor , intent upon the destruction of the political and religious order of the day , Socrates preached the necessity of knowing the limitations of true existential reality and the superiority of individual truth over the ossified laws and conventions of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his death , which he could have avoided by recanting or by going into exile ; he accepted them as the only means to reveal to men ultimate truths which connect them with the divine . The tragic hero must be responsible for his own death . His actions and thoughts must therefore be , within the context of his own limited knowledge , entirely just and ethical . The power which crushes him must also be , within its own terms of reference , just and ethical . The fate of Socrates was not simply his own , but that of the Greece of his time . On the one side there were the established laws , customs , religion and individual freedom of the citizens , all possessing the right to live according to the laws of the city , on the other there were the divine rights of individual conscience , the right to know , to search for the truth , the right to live by the higher standards of reason and , above all , to allow reason its basic prerogative which is to know itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought and consequently of the major developments of Western science and Western technology . Socrates did not sneer at , laugh at , or despise his judges and opponents ; he only tried , by antithetical and ironic questionings , to lead them towards higher truths which they would not or could not apprehend . This type of irony has nothing to do with irony of contrasts , of grotesque exaggeration of the real in order to illuminate an attitude or a feeling . Socrates was , above all , not so much a moralist as an idealist , a kind of incarnation of the good , who believed in the universal good and who wanted to spread it , so that everyone could share in it . The Greeks had no notion of evil , because they had no notion // of freedom from fate , the laws or the gods . They had the notion of obedience or disobedience to the laws of the city and to the gods , and the gods themselves conformed to this pattern of alternation between the two , but unfailingly obeyed the law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Evil , or what is called evil , is part of the finitude of man ; it implies either lack of consciousness of the nature of true being , or a daemonic essence , the being of which is evil , that is to say a denial of being ? something which would be a contradiction in terms . Lack of consciousness of the true reality of things is synonymous with ignorance or lack of knowledge , to which what is called evil can be attributed in the course of the exercise of our freedom which can only be posited at that price . So we can only be free ' , we can only know certain aspects of the truth , through suffering . Yet , if pain and affliction are too great , they are less a source of knowledge than of abasement and dejection beyond the control of the will . At the point of death , Christ was absolutely wracked by physical pain . Socrates was not , at least not in the same violent way , and there lies perhaps the cause of the difference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the serenity of Socrates . Christ , God-man , had reached the point when the vital energy which maintains life can bear no more , and that is why he cried out : Enough ! ' Socrates ' test was not , until the final end , a physical test , it was a test of the soul . Christ 's soul did not endorse and could not endorse his cry of protest , but his vegetative life could stand no more , and so he cried , and his soul separated itself from his vegetative , tortured body , waiting for reunion with it . The sorrow of Christ in his agony was only equalled by that of God , manifested by His silence . Socrates had no sorrow for himself , and there was no god he could address himself to . Christ knew that he was the Son of God , and he was dismayed at what he thought to be his Father 's forsaking of him . Socrates knew that the gods would not interfere in human affairs , unless it was for their own interests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was too busy with the affairs // of ' its godly performers to hear his call . Socrates hoped that his soul would reach the Elysian fields , where it would have been better than that of the gods , for it would have been completely purified of human passions , while the gods ' were not . In the Greek world Fate alone was beyond passions , and it dealt with gods and men with equal detachment . The gods could be both harassed and ordered about by Fate , while demi-gods and demigoddesses had to die in spite of their semi-divine origin . Christ also was born of a mortal , but he had been conceived not in passion , but because God chose to take human shape , for a given purpose . From the Greeks to St Augustine , Pascal , Kant and Kierkegaard , man has constantly been aware of the necessity of accepting the irrational as part of life . Believing , whatever its form , has never been equated with knowing , but neither can the concept of Being as a subsistent cause of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and responsibility for whatever happens in it . This is neither biologically nor metaphysically tenable . Being is creativity , and as such it implies a continuous annihilation of possibilities , therefore a continuous process of negation as part of the process of being . Personal suffering , sorrow and death are the normal lot of man , who dreams of the plenitude of Being . But being can only be at the cost of this lack of plenitude which makes room for nothingness . God could neither be guiding us continually , nor telling us constantly whether what we do is right or wrong . That is not possible . Man is only an atom in the cosmos ; it is the general pattern of creation that counts , and the pattern can only emerge slowly , through Time which necessarily carries good and evil , knowledge and ignorance , for just as there is no absolute good in life , but only varying degrees of good more or less tainted with evil , in the same way there is not and there can not be any absolute evil , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be evil tempered by good , and in the end separated from good in the Absolute which is totally good . 7 Science and Philosoply Les grandes pensees viennent du coeur . VAUVENARGUES The present ascendancy of science , and the role which it seeks to assume in certain quarters as a guiding authority of modern life , rest upon a misreading or a misrepresentation of history which is not supported by facts . In the light of this misreading , science is considered to be the high water mark of the growth of man , who is supposed to have moved from the mythical through the religious , to the age of science . Science is looked upon both as a kind of novelty in the history of man , and as the headstone of the human pyramid , and as such it has replaced myth , philosophy and religion . Yet science and the scientific attitude are not a **30;1058;TOOLONG novelty , nor are they possible substitutes for philosophy or for religion . There is , in fact , a fundamental , irreducible opposition between philosophy and science , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , the mathematician who throughout the centuries has often been both , in the same way as some philosophers were also poets , as was the case with Plato or Nietzsche . The great early Greek thinkers ? Anaximander , Pythagoras , Thales , Parmenides , Heraclitus , Empedocles ? were in varying degrees mathematicians , and also in varying degrees poets , philosophers and founders of religions or of metaphysical systems . On the other hand , the philosophers of imperial Rome , like Seneca or Cicero , were merely didactic moralists , no longer inventing , but merely propounding systems , and upholding the // state . The ancient Greek philosophers were , like Da Vinci and Michelangelo who were painters , sculptors , poets , architects and engineers , universal geniuses . The scope and range of their genius enabled them to embrace practically all aspects of human experience . In them the philosophical , the artistic and the scientific spirit were at one . Democritus invented atomic theories which are still more or less valid in our times . One hundred years before Francis Bacon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scientific knowledge , and fifty years before Copernicus he declared that the earth was a planet , like the moon . In modern times , great mathematicians like Leibnitz , Newton ( who is generally described as a natural philosopher , but he was also a great mathematician since he discovered the infinitesimal calculus at the same time as Leibnitz ) , Pascal , Whitehead or Bertrand Russell , were also , in varying degrees , philosophers , but it is clear that they would not , strictly speaking , be primarily described as scientists , at least according to the present-day meaning and connotations of this term . The scientist is above all concerned , not with the workings of pure reason , but with the workings of practical or experimental reason applied to the observations and structures of phenomena . A philosophic system , a philosophy , is on the whole connected with , and fully true only in relation to , the man who created it . Platonism , besides its universal values , is also Plato , just as Hegelianism is also Hegel , and each of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men of stature similar to that of those who created them , and who , therefore , can grasp them in their wholeness . These philosophies , like all philosophies , are not only related to their creators , but also to the time and the place where they were born . The philosopher generally starts from himself , in situ , and expresses himself and his time and , of course , beyond , according to the scope of his genius . Whether he endeavours to build up an abstract system like Leibnitz , Kant or Hegel , or endeavours to grasp metaphysical truths , in the philosopher-poet style of Plato or Nietzsche , he is // always deeply involved in his creations , and he is always basically concerned with the being of Being . The scientist , on the other hand , starts from facts or from hypotheses , which he seeks to verify or to universalize . Philosophic systems can not be built upon inductions from facts , or deductions from hypotheses ; philosophic systems are built up in attempts to rationalize attitudes to life and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of man and about his relationship with the cosmos and with the eternal flux or will-to-being to which he belongs , and which is also the will of Being . Scientists uncover the truth of the workings of Nature and of the universe , but these discoveries , which increase rational knowledge , can not become the foundations of an ethical attitude to life , or the sources of metaphysical truths which are basic to life . By metaphysical truths I mean truths which are valid , not because of their physical or mathematical verifiability , but because of their relationship to rational and meaningful experiences of the universe as a whole . Metaphysical truth is , of course , essentially individual , yet it reaches the universal , and it is apprehensible to all those who approach it , not through facts or phenomena as facts , but through phenomena as appearances of a reality which is not reducible to experimental verifiability . Metaphysics does not exclude rationality ; it never did , except in the type of dismissive , surface positivism which flourishes in modern times . On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to expound the coherences and relationships of systems which start from intuition and imagination and not from perceptions or from experimentations upon facts . Modern times have witnessed the increasing rise of science . and with it , attempts to make of it and of the scientific atti tude the basis and the source of all mental activities , thus reducing religion , ethics and even aesthetics to essentially scientific criteria . The answer to the death of God , to the sense of loss of direction , to the fear of the unknown or of impending catastrophe , is the modern Shaman ? the man of science // who , unless he is a man of genius , has put all his trust in what Whitehead has called one-eyed reason ' . The truly great scientific thinkers ? the great pre-Socratic mathematicians like Anaximander , Thales , Pythagoras or Heraclitus , and the great modern mathematicians like Newton , Leibnitz , Pascal , Einstein or Whitehead ? necessarily have a metaphysical view of the universe . The scale of their genius and their imagination is such as to enable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ verification of every smallest detail is impossible . Owing to the scope of their genius , they can contemplate their discoveries as complete wholes , in space and time , and as the embodiments of the spiritual forces or energies which animate them . If such an eagle-like gaze leaves here and there slight patches unlit or partly unexplored , this does not alter the truth and reality of the whole observed and held together as a coherence by the informing light of the observer . The average scientist , lacking the necessary range of awareness that would enable him to see himself as part of an allembracing whole , naturally seeks to universalize his fragmented observations and to make life conform to the criteria of his vision . This vision is , by definition , limited , and generally perceptual , and it disposes its owner to look at the whole world through the prism of his discoveries ? in whatever field he may have made them ? and to forget or to gloss over the fact that he is generally not very conversant with anything except the field in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which require , above all , concentration upon facts in a narrow , circumscribed domain , precludes receptivity , a wide range of interests and the imaginative capacity to reduce contrasted and remote aspects of life in all its forms to great syntheses whose truth and worth are measured , not by the truth or non-truth of a single fragment or part , but by the truth and coherence of the whole to which these elements belong . Neither Newton nor Einstein could have verified completely and exactly all the aspects of the workings of the systems which they discovered ; yet , in each case , their explanation of the life of the whole uniSCIENCE // verse was absolutely coherent and relatively true , that is to say true as far as their minds could reach at the moment in time when they made their discoveries . Einstein 's corrections of the Newtonian system carry with them certain aspects which do not quite conform to the overall truth of his own system . In fact , at the infinitesimally small microscopic level there seem to be particles of massless matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the system as a whole . Yet it is evident that the apparent behavioural unpredictabilities of minutely small particles , without mass and with little energy , neither impinge upon nor alter the orderly behaviour of the whole of matter , at the organic or inorganic level . They seem to be , for the moment , the unavoidable irregularities or unpredictabilities caused by the observation which records them , and therefore they might very well not exist at all if there were no observational interference . This strange Gordian knot can not be unravelled , since the knower not only records , but also necessarily causes the alteration in behaviour which he observes . In the end , therefore , it can only be cut with the sharp edge of belief , and there , it seems , this matter should rest at the moment . It is impossible to assert either that these irregularities intrinsically exist , or that they are caused by the presence of the observer . The likelihood that the latter alternative might be true is confirmed by the fact that , these very small exceptions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entirety to the law of cause and effect and to a perfectly rational order . In fact , when it comes to the laws which preside over the structure of the universe and the growth of human kind or of the individual , the consensus of opinion seems to be practically all-embracing and such as to include idealists like Leibnitz , Hegel or Nietzsche , as well as positivists like Auguste Comte . The principle of the necessity of self-caused forces for the maintenance of life , or what Nietzsche called the will to power ' , that is to say the will or force which animates the becoming of Being , makes being possible and also enables it to achieve its best fulfilment , // is upheld even by Auguste Comte . ' No legitimate order , ' he says , ' can establish itself , nor above all can it last , if it is not fully compatible with progress ; no great progress can effectively take place , if it does not finally tend toward the evident consolidation of order . ' Now , it is obvious that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are para-metaphysical terms and that they embody para-metaphysical notions . If , for instance , one replaces the word ' progress ' by the word ' becoming ' which is true to life , less abstract and also less ambiguous , one obtains a thought which is perfectly valid now and which , through its implication of self-caused finality , reconciles idealism , vitalism and Marxism . As for the word ' order ' , it can mean only a metaphysical or idealistic order otherwise called ' Being ' . The inference to be drawn from the above is that purely rational knowledge , within the contemporary limitations of the word , is only one aspect of life , and can not become or be viewed as the whole of it . The antinomy between knowledge and belief , or between knowledge and certainty , outlined by Kant , still remains unresolved , and can not certainly be resolved in favour of knowledge . Kant said : ' I had to abolish knowledge to make room for belief ; metaphysical dogmatism , that is to say the notion that one may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason , is the true source of every incredulity and revolt against morality . ' Men have now ceased paying attention to such distinctions ; they want , above all , to know , to know at any cost , and they tend to think that knowing is all , ignoring , of course , the vital question which is : to know what ? The modern problem is , as Schopenhauer put it , that ' knowledge must struggle against knowledge ' , for otherwise it will become a destructive monster ? that is to say , true knowledge must struggle against the mere desire to get information . The instinct to know ? a very noble instinct ? must not be reduced to the apprentice sorcerer 's urge to run the risk of unleashing secrets which he does not care to control , or to lift at all costs the lid of Pandora 's box , simply in order to know // what is in it , without caring at all about the final outcome of such an action . Least of all must knowledge be the urge to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tion and an aim ? not , of course , the kind of aim imposed by the state , as was the case in the notorious Lysenko controversy , but an aim dictated by the highest and noblest ideals of man . From the Greeks , the founders of knowledge , to the eight eenth-century explosion of limited or atrophied rationalism , knowledge was always meant to contribute to the benefit of a civilization which was based upon religious beliefs . Now , religion has been partly discarded , and even up to a point replaced by science , and civilization itself is put in dire danger by the frenzy of knowing and , through knowing , of acquiring power . Science has freed itself from the misplaced and short-sighted tyranny of religion when religion was all-powerful and , like all unchallengeable authorities , abused its power . But , having freed itself from the tyranny of religion , science is now succumbing in varying degrees , in communist as well as in capitalist countries , to the blighting tyranny of the state ? something which is not more praiseworthy than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painfully hammered into new shapes and new relationships with man , ever rise from its past errors and mistakes , regain some of its lost importance , and be once more the binding , living element of civilization ? Or will new aspects of spirituality , whatever they may be , take its place ? Will it be art , as Nietzsche boldly suggested ? ? Science now can only be controlled by art . It is a question of value judgments , relative to information and the multiple aspects of knowledge . This is an immense task which will bring great dignity to any form of art which can accomplish it . It will have to renew everything and , by itself , create life anew ! The Greeks have shown us what art could do ; without them our beliefs would be utopian . . . It is possible that art might even have the power of creating for itself a religion , of giving birth to a myth . Thus it was with the Greeks . ' In hoping for the rebirth of myth through art , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of myth as the expression of the ethos of a people , Nietzsche was merely being faithful to his belief in the importance of the individual and of the national element in the making of history . Before him , Vico had already deplored the death of myth and the ascendancy of the verum over the certum . Following Pascal 's and Locke 's differentiation between understanding and belief or assent , he moved further than either in insistence upon the primacy of certainty over Cartesian , abstract , mathematical truth . He also suggested what became more and more evident with the collapse of religion under the growing impact of science in the nineteenth century : that religion was bound to be replaced by spirit . Mankind had , in fact , moved from myth through paternalistic Judaism to Christianity , which , according to Vico , Hegel , Schopenhauer , Nietzsche and artists like Rimbaud and Mallarme , could only be followed by the dominance of spirit . Whatever one may think of these views of the evolution of history , the fact is that late nineteenth-century art is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from the spiritualism of Pierre Leroux , Mme Blavatsky and other magi , to the transcendentalism of Mallarme , and , later , the absolute subjectivism of Cubism and Surrealism , which marks the final overthrow of reason and the acceptance of the phenomenal world as nothingness , to be ignored and replaced by the inner subjectivity of the artist . The ancient Greek philosophers , in spite of the fact that they were practically all mathematicians , never equated truth with certainty . They treated metaphysical truths as poetic truths ; with them reason and imagination were at one , and reason possessed poetic powers . They therefore approached their gods through poetic imagination , and they pursued at the same time their unquenchable search for verifiable truth ; they kept these two notions firmly apart . What we generally call modern times seems to me to be characterized above all by the attempt to reduce the certum to the verum , and by the progressive elimination of metaphysics . The period described as modern times did // not , of course , begin suddenly , at a given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given moment . In fact , rationalism , born with the Greeks , revived by the Schoolmen and by Thomas Aquinas 's studies of Aristotle , grew steadily throughout the Middle Ages to reach its apex with Francis Bacon and Descartes , who equated truth with mathematical truth . From then on , truth became more and more synonymous with knowledge , and knowledge tended to replace certainty and belief . This has clearly destroyed the equilibrium upon which life is based , for , if it is undeniable that the aim of life is to know , and to reach the absolute , universal knowledge propounded by Hegel and Nietzsche , it is not possible to reduce truth to rational knowledge without excluding or endangering the very certainties which are the basis of the search for truth . The reduction of certainty to mathematical truth ended in conferring upon knowledge ontological value . For Hegel , knowledge meant greater and greater self-consciousness , progressing towards the emergence of absolute spirit . Kant maintained the distinction between the noumenon and the phenomenon , and between practical and pure reason . Nietzsche @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Kant 's than on Hegel 's side , and he gives to Kant 's categories an aspect of his own , which bristles with complexities and difficulties . First , he begins by defining the notion of knowledge as the attempt to schematize and to impose upon chaos the order and form necessary to satisfy practical needs ' . Chaos is obviously the complexity and flux of life which the mind , through its action upon it , annihilates . The practical needs alluded to are those which have to be met in order to make life possible . Yet , lest one might be tempted to believe that life is governed by purely practical needs and by reason and logic imposing order upon chaos , Nietzsche explains that chaos represents for him the virtualities of life , including human kind in its entirety and materiality , part of the universal flux bent upon becoming . Therefore this complex world can not be thought out logically and rationally , but only metaphysically , through poetic reason , by the poet-           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
