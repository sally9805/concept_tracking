Seldom has the environmental establishment been so embarrassed . A recent Los Angeles Times story reported that many major organizations in the movement " have sought to increase their income by investing in the very companies that they criticize most . " The stock portfolios of the Sierra Club and the Sierra Club Foundation have included securities of such frequent targets as General Motors , U.S. Steel , Tenneco , Weyerhaeuser Co. ( timber ) and Exxon . The Environmental Defense Fund also holds Exxon , even though the fund fought a court battle against the Alaska pipeline , in which Exxon owns a 25% interest . <P> FOE 'S Way . The National Audubon Society has leased out gas and oil rights on its hitherto pristine Paul J. Rainey Wildlife Sanctuary in Louisiana . Washington , D.C. , Attorney H. David Rosenbloom , an expert on the social aspects of investments , drew the obvious moral : " If your investments are operating to the detriment of the things for which you stand , there 's a question as to how much good you 're doing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explain their polluted portfolios . Argued E.D.F. 's Berkeley director , Tom Graff : " We ca n't invest in companies doing environmentally beneficial things , companies in solar energy or scrap iron , for example . If we did , it would look like we were promoting our economic interest when we took a stand on an issue . " Added Colburn Wilbur , executive secretary of the Sierra Club Foundation : " Every time we drive , fly or eat we are helping the polluters . We do n't have a pure investment portfolio . I do n't think we could if we tried . " <P> Professional money managers disagree . They point out that some investment funds already exist-the Dreyfus Third Century Fund is one-that carefully screen polluters out of their holdings . On the other hand , environmental groups could avoid the issue entirely as Friends of the Earth does : FOE sells contributions of stocks and bonds immediately and puts the proceeds to work fighting polluters.                    @
