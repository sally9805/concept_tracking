txt Europe and the United States are staring down the barrels of a trade war , unless sensible men on both sides of the Atlantic find an early compromise . Though the immediate problem involves ham , cheese , and butter cookies , its ramifications could ripple out to millions of dollars worth of other products and threaten the world 's faltering progress toward freer trade . Because of the transatlantic dispute , says a senior Carter administration official , " we are distinctly in danger of losing the Tokyo round . " The Tokyo round , so named becatise the current series of trade negotiations began in the Japanese capital , refers to the effort by nearly 100 nations at Geneva to knock down barriers to world trade . If the Geneva talks collapse ? and they will unless the U.S. and Europe reach agreement ? world trade might shrink as nations , including the United States , unilaterally block some of one another 's goods to preserve domestic jobs . Shrinkage of world trade would worsen global unemployment , for almost all advanced and developing countries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the United States , one out of every seven manufacturing jobs produces for export and more than half of American wheat , soybeans , and rice is sold overseas . - Simply put , the U.S. wants the nine nations of the European Community ( EC ) , or Common Market , to buy more American farm goods and to compete more fairly ( as American officials see it ) for agricultural sales to the third world . Europeans , in turn , want to prevent addi- // From page 1 Trade war threat tional U.S. duties from being slapped on a variety of their goods , as will automatically happen beginning Jan. 3 , 1979 , unless a solution is found . European officials remind Americans that the United States enjoys a huge trade surplus with the EC , the bulk of that in farm goods . American farmers send $6 billion worth of their crops to the nine nations of the Common Market , while the U.S. imports only $1 billion worth of European farm goods in return . Yet it is Common Market farm exports ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Danish butter cookies ? against which the U.S. is about to move . President Carter and his chief trade negotiator , Robert S. Strauss , do not wish to do so . But they have no choice , for Congress ? in the expiring hours of its just-ended session ? failed to give the White House renewed authority not to apply " countervailing duties . " Under a law dating back to 1897 , the U.S. Treasury is obliged to levy additional duties on foreign goods which received export subsidies from their governments ? even if no injury to American producers is claimed . Mr. Strauss and his trade team have spent months at Geneva trying to get U.S. trading partners , including the EC , to agree to guidelines governing what governments should and should not do about subsidizing exports . Meanwhile , under temporary authority granted by Congress , the U.S. Treasury has not applied countervailing duties to offending imports , although 15 categories of goods are subject to duties under the law . President Carter and Mr. Strauss sought an extension of their waiver authority , but Congress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legislation , failed to act . Response of the Council of Ministers of the EC is to say that neither guidelines on export subsidies nor action on other disputed trade issues can be concluded-without a waiver extension . U.S. Rep. Charles A. Vanik ( D ) of Ohio , chairman of the trade subcommittee of the House Ways and Means Committee , sent a letter to Mr. Strauss promising quick congressional action on the waiver extension when Congress convenes in January . But , said Mr. Vanik , such action will take place only if the U.S. has an agreed-upon export subsidies code in hand . " So , " said a White House official , " you have a chicken and egg situation . Which comes first ? " Other items important to world trade remain to be settled in the Geneva talks , which officials had hoped to conclude by Dec. 15 . Differences on most issues have been narrowed substantially . Now , however , everything hangs on political decisions to be taken by governments in Washington and Europe , each looking to the special needs of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
