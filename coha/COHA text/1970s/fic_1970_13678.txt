Each actor picked a torture fitting his speech ( crucifixion , the rack ) : some were tied up , strung up , hung up , or boxed in . Light came from candles placed at each torture , and one twenty -- five -- watt blue bulb . The audience was on a central plank walkway but they were not conjined to it . As an audience member approached the actor would go into his speech . In the Immaculate Heart production , the audience was asked to exit up onto the stage and out the stage door into the scene shop where two actors in Mickey Mouse and Porky Pig masks gave them each a sparkler and a balloon . Another actor led them down a long dark tunnel . The tunnel opened into a giant auditorium about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( between twenty and thirty ) of varying heights , lit from below . The actors they 'd seen were each on a cross engaged in his own " kvetch " with God . The actors said their speeches to God , over and over till they went into trance states . As the audience passed by the crosses , masked menacing figures ( three ) went among them and blew up their balloons with lighted cigarettes . When the audience emerged from the room of the crosses they were offered bread , wine , and cheese . At the Actors Studio in New York City , the audience was asked to exit down a spiral staircase which led from the theater through a darkened room into the back courtyard . Here they met the actors on crosses lit by candles from below or in various tortures of their own design ( i.e. , one actress had locked herself forever into a telephone booth forever calling people who were n't there , another was almost drowning in a barrel , another was being constantly screwed by a wooden phallus , another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with mirrors ) .
