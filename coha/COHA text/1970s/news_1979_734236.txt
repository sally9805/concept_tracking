txt In 1974 , when a bill to reform campaign financing first came up in the House , PAC 's ? political action committees for special interests ? handed out $12.5 million to Congressional candidates . The bill lost , but came up again in 1976 , a year in which PAC 's gave out $22.6 million . Last year , when the measure lost in the House by 17 votes , PAC contributions had climbed to $35 million . And the big growth lies ahead , as corporations discover the art form . In four years , the number of corporate PAC 's has jumped from 89 to 821 . Unless campaign financing is changed by 1980 , it may be too late . Congress may already be sold . These millions are not being spent corruptly . PAC 's are legal and have a right to try to get their views across . Likewise , we note what Representative Guy Vander Jagt , chairman of the Republican Congressional Committee , said in a letter on this page a few weeks ago : PAC 's are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account for only 16 , cents of every campaign dollar . But if the PAC 's are so harmless and so , well , democratic , why is industry rushing to establish them ? Why have they become so indispensable a part of the booming corporate effort to influence Congress ? A few days ago , the Conference Board , a respected business research body , reported on how large corporations , once merely defensive when it came to political activity , are turning to " highly aggressive government relations . " Why do these efforts routinely involve PAC 's , including fund-raising from employees " and even stockholders " ? The fact is that PAC 's work . They give companies a very large bang for their bucks . That is clear from case studies compiled by CornReproduced mon Cause , the national political reform organization . For example , last summer , the 43-member House Interstate and Foreign Commerce Committee was considering a bill to hold down hospital costs . That was , and is , one of the Carter Administration 's chief goals ; it could save consumers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opponent was the American Medical Association . Over three years , its political action committee contributed $101,259 to the campaigns of members of the committee . Last July , the committee defeated the bill by one vote . " When you spray money over almost half the douse , " John Gardner , the founding chairman of Common Cause once observed , " you probably have something in mind . " ? One powerful answer to the distorting influence of PAC money is to reduce the need for it by providing public financing in Congressional campaigns . As the nation knows from the 1976 Presidential campaign , public financing works , and a bill to create partial funding for Congressional races has again been introduced in the House . It would provide public matching funds to candidates who have a genuine following and who agree to limit their total spending . The House leaders designated the reform bill H. R. 1 as a sign of the importance they attached to it ? at least initially . But the bill was recently voted down in committee and now the House leaders say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reconsider . If not , they owe the public answers to two questions : Do they deny the PAC problem that the bill seeks to solve ? And if not , do they have a better solution ?
