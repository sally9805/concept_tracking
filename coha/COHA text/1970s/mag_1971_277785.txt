At first , the half-hour television film The Passover seems to be one of those instructive seasonal documentaries . A Jewish family is sitting down to a typical Passover Seder . An announcer tells the story of the Exodus , the Jews ' anguish in Egypt and their struggle to leave , and that terrible night the Angel of the Lord passed by the houses of the Jews to strike down the first-born sons of their Egyptian masters . On the traditional Seder table are the symbolic foods : the salt water and bitter herbs , reminders of the time of bondage ; the roasted lamb , recalling the paschal sacrifice on the eve of the Exodus ; the mixture of apples , nuts , spices and wine , symbol of the mortar with which the Hebrews made bricks for Pharaoh .
