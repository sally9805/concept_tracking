 | On a blazing September day three years ago , a motorbike sped across the wilderness of the Arizona desert , its tires kicking a storm of dust into the blue dome of sky . Astride it was a suntanned man in Levis and moccasins , a sweatband tied around his head , his long beard parted by the wind . In an approaching car that bumped along the road , a passenger sighed in disgust . " Hippies , " he said . " They 're everywhere ! " The driver grinned . " That 's no hippie , " he said . " That 's Dick Van Dyke . " The driver was Van Dyke 's assistant , Frank Adamo , who was about to visit Dick 's ranch for the first time and had phoned for help after a sweltering hour of exploring sundry dirt roads that led nowhere . For some years , Van Dyke had been talking about retirement but no one believed him because of the legend that actors never really give up the spotlight until it 's wrenched away from them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in 1968 , when he bought the ranch and began spending weekends on the 180-acre spread north of Phoenix , friends clucked in dismay . He would never make it ? not Dick , swallowed up in all that cactus . He has proved them wrong ? at least halfway wrong . In June of 1969 he sold his home in Los Angeles and packed his family off to Arizona . Today Dick is firmly entrenched in the vastness , the quiet , and the loneliness of a land that for centuries has cast its spell over men . But he has not retired . Not yet . A new Dick Van Dyke Show begins airing Saturday nights on CBS in September , and by that time a full season 's segments ? a total of 26 ? will have been filmed ? a " first " in television . While that is the  | talk of the industry , even more of a conversation piece is the locale of the filming . The country north of Phoenix and its suburb , Scottsdale , appears to be fit only for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broken by small hills that look as though they 'd been dribbled by giants making sand castles . The arid expanse is dotted with low-growing shrubs and plants with strange names like saguaro and catclaw . To an urbanite the silence is almost frightening , and on the lonely road 30 miles north of Scottsdale you might well be 3,000 miles from anywhere . Yet it is there that the sign is posted , bright blue letters on a white background ? THE DICK VAN DYKE SHOW . It is enough to put any tourist into shock , and they tell me a few cars have gone careening off the road at that point . Three hundred yards to the east , however , there is at least a quasiexplanation , a Spanish-tiled building that looks , and is , big enough to contain everything necessary for moviemaking . Begun before Dick bought his ranch , the Graham Studio has been used for motion-picture projects , ineluding Zabriskie Point . And from January through July of this year , CBS has been flying cast and crew from Los Angeles to Phoenix @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dick is only slightly embarrassed about his quick return to television . " I get razzed about it all the time . But that studio was sitting there like a here a magnet , unused , and I had to pass it every time I drove into town . I asked my partner , Byron Paul , if he thought CBS might do a series with me , on condition it could be done here in the desert . The network said yes ? so fast that we called Carl Reiner in a panic . " Reiner , creator of the original Van Dyke Show , came up with an idea for a new one that promises to be a winner . And Dick found himself back at work " in an ideal situation . Now I can live in the desert and work on my own terms . " The desert life is intensely important to Dick . He fell . in love with it at first sight in 1947 when he drove west from his hometown of Danville , Ill . " But the desert is n't for everybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here are split ? some want to move here , but it drives others crazy . To me , the desert is never the same ; there 's a mystery about it that draws me . And the quiet ! My wife loves it even more than I do , so much that she does n't like to leave the ranch even for shopping . So I do it , but I let it build up so I only have to drive into town once a week . And when I have to go to Los Angeles ? which is as seldom as possible ? I come back so wound up it takes me three days to slow down and get back into sync with Marge . We 're both introverted , private people . The ones with drive , the gregarious people , could never make it . Can you see Carl Reiner on a mule out there ? " And he points to the endless vista . What he is saying is that the desert is bicarbonate of soda for those who ca n't digest the turmoil of city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very private people . His career on the nightclub circuit , in television and movies , pitched them into a milieu that was not their cup of tea . Married since 1948 , they eschewed show-business parties , and seldom attended the theater or even movies . But even so , life in Hollywood with their four children was marred by constant pressure to join a social swirl neither enjoyed . Says Carl Reiner , " Dick 's a very real guy who has none of that love-me-orI ' 11-die quality of performers ? he just is . He 's happy now because no one 's pulling at him . His house in Encino was comfortable . but it only could provide a sort of bastardized ranch life . Once he bought the desert property , Dick could n't wait to move . "  | Fortunately , every member of the family is part desert rat . Marge Van Dyke , who 's in her forties , looks ten years younger . Last year , a pancreas infection forced her onto a bland diet and she ultimately shed 20 pounds . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same weight , " says Dick . " And the way she loves to eat , it 's like being in heaven . " Her gray hair is cropped to a three-inch length , and her green eyes sparkle in a tanned face . In the Western clothes she loves ? jeans and boots and vests ? she looks like a walking ad for the Arizona Chamber of Commerce . And , she says , " I 'm so happy it 's unbelievable . " Chris , who 's 21 , lived on the ranch until last summer when he married his fiancee , Caydie , in a Phoenix church . " It was the only time since we moved to the desert , " Dick says with a grin , " that Marge wore a dress . " Chris now majors in law at Occidental College in Los Angeles , but he is the only de serter . Barry , who looks forward to an acting career , is 19 and a production assistant on his father 's show , in charge of transportation of the herds of people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has forsaken horses for drama , and the class she takes in musical drama at the local high school has led to singing roles in school productions of Marne and other Broadway shows . Nine-year-old Carrie Beth spends three hours a day at the piano , and has supplanted her sister 's interest in horses . Riding is the one facet of Western life that Dick and Marge have n't adopted . " They have two horses at the ranch , " says Frank Adamo , " but you wo n't catch Dick on either one . Once he had to straddle a donkey for a show , and I thought he was going to die of fright . " There are far more frightening things in the desert than horses . A fierce land , it abounds in tarantulas , scorpions , coral snakes and rattlers . In the beginning Marge was terrified of the snakes , despite the 30-inch-high " snake wall " that is standard equipment for the protection of every desert house . But she has since put to use her excellent marksmanship and has shot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subtle hues of lavender , green and blue . " The desert appears to be dead , " says Dick , " but if you 'll look , you 'll find it alive with creatures . " He and Marge put out food for the wildlife and , in the soft nights , watch the panorama of nature in their own backyard . Marge remembers best the rabbit that gave birth while they watched , and later trained the young ones to jump over the snake wall . Dick had thought the coyotes were kings of the desert " until the night we saw a skunk waddle into their midst , and they flew off , tails between their legs . " On some nights , Dick and Marge sleep in the bunkhouse down by the barn , and in the dim light from the big house , watch the owls swoop down on  | their prey . They hike together in the cool hours of dawn and sunset , roaming up their mountain where they have uncovered a rock home made by an Indian tribe that disappeared a thousand years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beads , some of which Marge strung for Dick , and he wears them in the " title " scenes of the TV show . Scratch a comedian and you find a serious man . Says Frank Adamo , " Back in Hollywood , Dick spent hours playing his harpsichord , or just sitting and thinking . So it is n't news that here he spends the same sort of time looking at rocks or troops of ants . " Both Marge and Dick have the requisite for desert dwelling ? they can live in comfort with themselves . Their ranch , the last one before 100 miles of Tonto National Forest , has been named Sitio con Dios ? A Godly Place . Good Housekeeping , based in the middle of Manhattan , was naturally curious to know what a woman does to fill the days in such a situation , while her husband is eight miles away on a sound stage . When the question was put to her , Marge 's answering smile indicated that perhaps city dwellers could use some lessons in relaxation . As for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Marge says , " a great deal of it about Indian lore . I learned to weave and now I want to make an Indian rug . I do all the housekeeping ? we much prefer not having anyone around . The house is easy to keep clean because it 's sealed against dust . But we had to rip out the dark floors and put in sandcolored quarry tile to prevent footprints from showing . I cook ? Dick likes to make breakfasts ? and I do needlepoint , and knit . " Her needlepoint artistry is evident in the bar-stool covers , each worked in a design of a different flowering cactus . The stools are made of butcher blocks , as are some of the chairs and the dining table . The house itself sits in a gully , near a creek that nourishes cottonwood and eucalyptus trees . There is a master bedroom , one for Stacy , one for Carrie , and one for Marge 's parents who live with them . Barry 's headquarters are in the bunkhouse . The same blue-green paint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The ceilings are white , the furniture of brushed suede in a shade of honey . A mountain-lion skin covers the floor in front of the floor-to-ceiling rock fireplace . The home is wide and cool and very Western , and it brings the desert inside . No windows are curtained except those in the master bedroom , and the bathroom is the sole " luxury appointed " room in the house . The family dug gray-green rock from the creek and used it to make a sunken tub , then lined one wall and continued it to the outside , where there is a waterfall . The effect , with a floor-to-ceiling window , is that of bathing in a grotto . " It 's a fundamental house , " says Dick . " No bric-a-brac , and lots of room . You could bowl in this house . The one in Encino was Spanish and so we filled it with dark furniture and hot colors , and sold the whole thing to Sergio Mendez , including my harpsichord . Which was n't very fancy anyway ? it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , which may not be for the purists , but good enough for me . " We have a 24-foot trailer for camping trips , and each of us has a Honda and a Jeep . If we had to go any place  | fancy we 'd be stuck for transportation . I seldom play tennis any more , and have n't sketched since we moved . The days go by so fast we do n't know what happened to them . " People who know him invariably remark that Dick , at 45 , is twice as relaxed as he was in Hollywood . Says Byron Paul , " He 's at home here . When a picture he 'd been committed for was postponed from its September starting date , Dick lit up . He said , I 'm going to cruise to Europe and then come back and grow my beard again , and look at the desert . ' " Says son Barry , " Dad has slowed down . He is more relaxed in every way . And I think it 's good for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing things on his own time . Here he 's the boss ; on the old show he was a hired hand . Now he 's much more comfortable with himself . " The natives of Cavecreek , the small town four dirt-road miles from Sitio con Dios , as well as those in Carefree , the resqrt spot a stone 's throw from the studio , give Van Dyke the privacy he wants . He is active in civic affairs , has made a film with the Boy Scouts about the desert , addressed the local school 's eighth-grade graduating class , ridden the float made by Adamo for Cavecreek 's centennial celebration , and narrated the Christmas pageant which took place in mountains above a winding road lighted by candles stuck into sand-filled paper bags . The local citizens know him and are proud that he has joined them , but are quietly protective . When Dick 's mother first visited the area and asked for directions to the Van Dyke ranch , nobody would tell her , even when she insisted he was her son . Dick has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own TV series . It is the type of work Van Dyke realizes is his special metier . Since Mary Poppins , his movies have not been bonanzas . There were flops like Fitz Willy and Lt. Robin Crusoe , U.S.N. Even the high-budgeted Chitty Chitty Bang Bang , for which the family spent a year in England ( " served by a butler whose only talent was folding napkins in the shape of swans , and a cook who was good only at gathering flowers " ) was less than moderately successful . Only his latest , Cold Turkey , is proving not to be a turkey at the box office . Under the guiding hand of Reiner , the new show promises the popularity of the first . Exchanging " Rob Petrie " for " Dick Preston , " Van Dyke portrays a man with a talk show on a Phoenix radio station , the father of two , and married to Hope Lang . Fresh from The Ghost and Mrs. Muir , Hope says , " It 's nice to be working with a mortal again " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comedian . There is not only great rapport between them on the set , but also great affection between Hope and the Van Dykes in their personal lives . In the audience warm-up preceding the show 's taping , Dick introduced Hope as " an actress I enjoy working with because , one , she 's a great actress and , two , she reminds me of my wife . " Dick is delighted with the cast 's enthusiasm and the way they work together . On the set , he said , " I never thought lightning could strike twice , but it 's happened again . And this time we 're doing themes that would have been impossible on the old show . Nobody 's going to outguess this one .... " He was interrupted by a prop man who handed him a wristwatch . " You left this somewhere three days ago , " said the man . " Whaddya know , " said Dick . " I did n't even miss it . " That , I 'm sure you 'll agree , is a relaxed man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
