From the air , Saigon appears to shimmer in the midday sunshine . The light dances off mile after mile of tin-roof shacks , and reflects from the waters of serpentine rivers . On the ground , unfortunately , the city has lost its glitter . Though it remained gracious and unhurried until four or five years ago , reports TIME Correspondent Marsh Clark , Saigon now suffers from the ills that afflict modern cities-and then some . No fewer than 894,000 vehicles , ranging from Lambrettas to lumbering trucks , jam the city 's streets . Their fumes engulf Saigon in a noxious blue haze that is killing the city 's stately tamarind trees . Sidewalks are crowded with vendors . Alleys are scenes of chaos , as dogs , children and chickens scurry amid garbage and rubble . <P> Row after row of shacks are built on stilts and often are constructed from sheets of rolled beer cans . One family lives with hundreds of Miller High Life emblems as the facade of its house , while a neighbor may prefer the hues of Pabst Blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canals whose black waters reek of raw , pungent sewage . In the shacks , which have no electricity and little furniture , adults and children sleep side by side in a single room usually measuring no more than 8 ft. by 10 ft . Even so , they are lucky . Other residents of Saigon are forced to sleep on sidewalks , under bridges , or even in unused sewer pipes . <P> Ahead of Hong Kong . Saigon is bursting at the seams . Swelled by wave after wave of refugees and of peasants seeking prosperity from the war boom , South Viet Nam 's capital has grown by 50% , to 2.2 million , since fighting was stepped up in 1964 . Today it is by far the world 's most densely populated city , with half again as many people in each square mile as in Hong Kong , the world 's second most congested urban area . What has happened to Saigon is indicative of what is happening all over <P> South Viet Nam . The small nation of 18 million has experienced a migration to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ During the past ten years . South Viet Nam has been transformed from a rural nation where 80% of the people lived on farms into a society where 40% to 50% are city dwellers . Other South Vietnamese cities have grown at an even faster rate than Saigon : since 1964 , Cam Ranh has nearly quintupled to 85,000 , Tarn Hiep has tripled to 62,000 , and Danang has more than doubled to 400,000 . <P> Experts disagree on the ultimate effects of the mass migration . Samuel P. Huntington , professor of government at Harvard , has argued that by accident the mass urban migration may turn out to be a great benefit for the U.S. and its South Vietnamese allies . " In an absent-minded way , the U.S. in Viet Nam may well have stumbled upon the answer to ' wars of national liberation , ' " he has written . Huntington 's thesis : since the government controls the cities , the population shift has made the countryside much less important politically . As a result the Communists are finding it far harder than before to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ areas to choke off and finally conquer the isolated and outmanned cities .
