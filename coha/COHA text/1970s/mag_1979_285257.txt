It comes stealing up on us first in the wide eyes of very young children , who see Christmas shining a long way off . Older brothers and sisters are more nonchalant ; they can be downright businesslike about it . A camera would be O.K. , but how about a snowmobile ? As the day approaches , the spirit settles over them , too , like fresh snow on a busy town . Parents come round last , rushing from toy stores to cocktail parties , muttering about the cost of evergreen trees , chilled by the cold glare of Christmas bills to come . By Christmas Eve , though , everybody is a willing conspirator . <P> All across America , the same stirring . But it shows itself in different ways . In the capitals of the 50 states , those differences are delineated in lights . This Christmas the capitals have become beacons bearing witness to individual state character . <P> In Santa Fe , N. Mex. , government buildings , businesses and houses are trimmed with farolitos , votive candles burning on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a warming gleam against the dark . Olympia , Wash. , launched a gaudy annual contraption called Christmas Island , assembled from Army pontoon bridges and anchored offshore with a forest of lights and a life-size Nativity scene . Denver 's stately City and County Building is a blinking , electrified gingerbread house as multicolored as a jukebox . Not to be outdone , Austin sports a 165-ft. - tall , man-made metal tree shining out over a Santa 's Village of shops in a turn-of-the-century setting . Atlanta 's capitol holds its own 31-ft . Eastern red cedar , bedecked with red ribbons and 2,000 white yarn snowflakes painstakingly crocheted by the state 's senior citizens . Boston 's golden-domed statehouse backs a Common of white-lit trees . In Sacramento this year , because the capitol building is undergoing reconstruction to strengthen it against earthquakes , only two 10-ft. firs herald the holiday . And in Washington , a white spruce festooned with 2,500 colored lights and 5,000 shiny ornaments easily upstages the Capitol behind it . But over near the White House the nation 's official Christmas tree is dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Iran have yet to receive a Christmas gift of freedom from the unwise men in the East . ?
