For Volcker , happiness is tight money and 20 cigars <P> This good gray banker is not without humor . Invited to a Halloween party in 1970 , 6-ft. 7-in . Paul Volcker daubed his bald pate with green body paint , donned a pair of emerald tights and arrived as the Jolly Green Giant . Even at work , the chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank , who last week so jolted the U.S. economy , appears equally unbankerly . He is seldom without a fetid , 20 gold seal stogie clamped between teeth stained with nicotine . Ashes invariably litter the lapels of his rumpled , shiny suits . He likes to plop down unceremoniously in a Fed cafeteria beside a startled young staffer and grill him on economic policy during lunch . <P> But Paul Volcker is a maverick only in appearance and style . His reputation as a staunch defender of the dollar is as sound as the German mark , and international as well as American banking leaders were delighted when he was picked by Carter after he had been enthusiastically recommended by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaving to become Secretary of the Treasury . Says Senate Banking Chairman William Proxmire : " Volcker was appointed by the President with his eyes wide open . Carter knew he was a hard-money type . That 's what the market wanted . That 's what the foreign business community wanted . " <P> Since his appointment , Volcker has maintained his independence of the Administration , but did consult with both Carter and Miller before making his draconian decision . Too much was at stake not to let them know what he was planning . Said he : " No one goes into this with the happy spirit of ' right on . ' But Miller and the President indicated we had their fullest support . " Volcker remained confident last week about the correctness of his move despite the yaws in gold and the gyrations in the stock market . As Presidential Economic Adviser Charles Schultze put it , " It 's not a question of what Volcker wants to do . What 's his choice ? " <P> Volcker 's choice stems from no allegiance to one school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economic philosophy is purely eclectic , " explains former Federal Reserve Board Member Andrew Brimmer , " although his own experience would obviously make him one who believes in the market process . " Last week , after his announcement , Volcker told a convention of the American Bankers Association in New Orleans of the need for " discipline " and " stability " in handling the economy , two of his favorite words . Said he : " We can no longer blithely assume we can ' buy ' prosperity with a little more inflation , because inflation itself is the greater threat to economic stability . " <P> Son of a New Jersey city manager , Volcker hustled to a B.A. degree summa cum laude at Princeton and a master 's degree in political economy from Harvard . After a few months of studying for a doctorate at the London School of Economics , Volcker quit . Says he grimly : " My lasting memory of the place is the repeated need to put shillings into a heater in a small , cold flat at night . "  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
