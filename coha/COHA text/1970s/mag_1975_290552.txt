Last week CBS and the Block Drug Co. combined to make the unlikeliest gunfighters since Batman and Robin . Together they had stood off the 1 million-strong National Rifle Association and its allies , the firearms manufacturers and game-preserve associations . That is more than Congress has been able to accomplish . <P> CBS 's combat with the N.R.A . was occasioned by The Guns of Autumn , a documentary that purported to describe hunting in America . In 90 minutes , Director-Writer Irv Drasnin , a journalist for 15 years but not a hunter , compiled carnage upon atrocity . Black bears were slaughtered at a Michigan garbage dump by tourists with rifles . A gang of rednecks with the latest electronic gear treed a bear , then watched hounds rip it apart . Explained the pack 's leader : " We feel that they deserve a chew . " A pert stewardess plunked down $500 to " harvest " her first buffalo ; then she pointed to the hoofs : " Jim , did I want those for footstools ? " In the program 's grossest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at pointblank range ; then a burly rifleman grasped the antlers for his mandatory macho snapshot . <P> False Rumors . To their subsequent regret , many gun groups and hunters helped Drasnin research the film when he started work last winter . As shooting progressed , however , they realized they were not Drasnin 's subjects but his quarry . In early July , TV Guide reported that the program would describe hunting " 50% from the animals ' point of view , " setting off a shiver of apprehension in N.R.A . ' s Washington headquarters . A letter-writing campaign to CBS began . Harry L. Tennison , vice president of the Coca-Cola Bottling Co. of Fort Worth , warned , " If we are paying out a lot of money for advertising on a network that does not go along with our type of thinking , then perhaps we here , in this area , can change networks . " Others were convinced that the program " would jeopardize their right to own handguns . Advertisers were made nervous by false rumors ; one canceled because it heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the program was aired , the N.R.A . infiltrated an affiliates ' screening and jotted down the names of the advertisers present . By air time , all but one of the scheduled companies had withdrawn their commercials . The standout was Block Drug ( two 30-second spots ) . CBS went ahead with the program anyway , filling the station breaks with promotions of its own . <P> The N.R.A . remains complacent . Its membership , the association claims , is growing as a result of the publicity . " Hunters are not the slobs and killers that the show made us out to be , " maintains an organization official . " Guns of Autumn did n't show people going out and really enjoying the companionship of others , the wonders of being outdoors or how the hunter has restored the wildlife habitat . " <P> Unmoved , the network plans a sequel next week , Echoes of the Guns of Autumn , about the controversy . Says Bill Leonard , CBS senior vice president , " Nothing would so guarantee that a broadcast would get on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
