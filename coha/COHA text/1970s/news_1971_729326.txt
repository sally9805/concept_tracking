txt Assembly Speaker Perry B. Duryea Jr . told Republican Assemblymen today that Governor Rockefeller and Republican legislative leaders had agreed to cuts of $700-million in the administration 's proposed $8.45-billion budget . Mr. Duryea told his colleagues at a closed meeting that state aid to localities would be cut by $400-million , state operating expenses by $200-million and capital construction by $100-million . The cutbacks were more than double the " at least $300-million " in reductions that Governor Rockefeller had publicly agreed to . Republican legislative leaders apparently convinced Mr. Rockefeller that he could not pass a budget without such drastic trims . School Cut Restored Detailed discussion of the budget at separate Senate and Assembly conferences of Republican legislators was put off until tomorrow by a last-minute snag when suburban Republican legislators threatened to oppose the budget unless a $60-million cut in state school aid was restored . After a hurried conference between Mr. Duryea of Montauk , L. I. , and Warren Anderson , Republican of Binghamton and chairman of the Senate Finance Committee , the schoolaid funds were restored with the money coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ payments to the Big Six cities , including New York , City , and welfare costs . The cuts in rev. enue sharing and welfare have not been made public but it is known that the Assembly Ways : and Means Committee proposed a $79.2-million , cut in revenue sharing by reducing the formula from 21 per cent to 18 per cent of the state 's income tax collections earmarked for the Big Six cities . The committee proposed cuts of $153.7-million in welfare expenditures and Medicaid . This would mean tightening the eligibility for Medicaid , reducing welfare payments by 12 per cent across the board , eliminating a proposed cost - of - living increase , and ending home relief programs for single persons and childless couples . Legislators Wooed These proposals arc still subject to change as Mr. Duryea and State Senate Majority Leader Earl W. Brydges of Niagara Falls begin an intensive effort to win the agreement of 76 of the 79 Republican Assemblymen and 29 of 31 G.O.P. Senators . These are the mi ? jorities needed to pass the budget if the . Republicans get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thursday . Some legislators predicted that the Republican leaders could obtain a majority with the $700-million cut and welfare revision legislation , which the Governor is expected to propose over the weekend . The revision would be aimed at holding down the spiraling cost of welfare in future budgets by revising welfare formulas and eligibility requirements . However , other legislators were not as optimistic . They predicted that Republican holdouts would force the Governor and his legislative lieutenants to cut even further into the budget . One figure frequently mentioned is a total cut of $780-million , which would require only the proposed one-cent increase in the sales tax to balance the budget . Mr. Rockefeller had originally proposed a $1.1-billion taxincrease package , including higher income , sales , business , gasoline , liquor and cigarette levies as well as increases in motor vehicle registration and virtually every other state licensing fee . The Task Ahead Almost all of these measures , with the exception of the rise in the sales tax , are expected to be abandoned even if the $700-million cut is not increased . Although Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time corralling a majority in the less-disciplined Assembly , Mr. Brydges has , at least on the surface , the most difficult task . Four upstaters of the 31 Re . publican Senators committed themselves at a party conference to oppose any tax increase . Six Republican Assemblymen from the Syracuse area joined the four Senators in recommending more than $1-billion in budget reductions , but only one of the Assemblymen , Edward Kinsella , has committed himself to oppose any tax increment . Party leaders said they would keep Republican legislators here over the weekend in an effort to win agreement on a budget and have it printed in time for passage next Wednesday . " Once you let them out of the Capitol , you 're dead , " a legislative leader said . He observed that weariness and isolation from various constituent pressures would work for the leaders . Democratic legislators have been virtually ignored in the process and had planned to return home for the weekend . However , Stanley Steingut of Brooklyn , the Assembly minority leader , asked his colleagues to stay here in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Democrats have demanded that they be given ample opportunity to study the budget before it is brought up for a vote .
