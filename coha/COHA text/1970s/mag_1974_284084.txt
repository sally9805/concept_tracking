True or false : the energy crisis was a blessing in disguise . Most Americans would immediately say false . By tripling oil prices and cutting production for a while , the Arab nations created severe new international balance of payments problems , disrupted business , backed up long lines at gasoline pumps and caused countless other hardships . But at an energy conference held by Time Inc. in Williamsburg , Va. , speakers from Government , industry and environmental groups also saw a brighter side to the five-month oil embargo . They believe that it awakened Americans to long-festering energy troubles and started them thinking about solutions . <P> Treasury Secretary William Simon defined the way out of the crisis in two words : Project Independence . Within the next decade , he told the conference , the U.S. must increase the supply of domestic energy while decreasing the growth in demand for it . That will be anything but easy . One panel of experts* emphasized the long lead times and billions of dollars of capital needed to develop oil-shale deposits , clean up coal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as geothermal power into operation . Indeed , reaching self-sufficiency in a decade is probably impossible . <P> <P> Two things must be done while the technicians strive for that goal . The oil companies , said John K. McKinley , president of Texaco , have " to do the job of supplying the country with some 78% of its total energy in the form of oil and gas . " Even more important , Americans must apply themselves to the vital task of cutting demand by conserving energy . <P> Much depends on commerce and industry , which consumes about 70% of the energy used by the U.S. John C. Sawhill , head of the Federal Energy Administration , said that his office has asked all big businesses to cut down on their use of energy , by such moves as improving industrial processes , recycling heat or lowering lighting levels . Such efforts could reduce industrial energy consumption by 10% to 15% - the equivalent of 1,100,000 bbl. of oil per day . <P> New Ethic . Another area where conservation is worth special effort is the private car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 31 % of its petroleum . <P> The FEA hopes that high gasoline prices will make motorists keep auto engines tuned up , forgo unnecessary trips and form car pools . If each driver cut his gas consumption by 15% , the overall saving would be about 680,000 bbl. per day , or 10% of total demand . <P> But will the public respond ? Democratic Senator Jennings Randolph of West Virginia had his doubts . On a recent road trip , he said , he found that no fewer than 63% of all drivers were exceeding the still-in-effect 55 m.p.h. national speed limit . Added Senator Henry M. Jackson , Democrat of Washington : " There is no direct evidence to support the contention that by raising the price you are going to ration the amount of gasoline that will be available . " On the other hand , Congress and the Nixon Administration are extremely reluctant to impose such mandatory conservation measures as gasoline rationing or new taxes on energy-intensive machines . Simon put it bluntly : " Conservation should be voluntary . People should have a freedom of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
