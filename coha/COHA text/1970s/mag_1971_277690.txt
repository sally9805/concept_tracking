Four times in the past year , John Fretwell 's air-conditioning equipment company in Dallas was broken into and robbed . Fretwell took to renting a Doberman pinscher watchdog for weekend duty , but at $75 a weekend , the protection itself seemed little better than petty larceny . <P> Then Fretwell went up to Oklahoma a month or so ago for a snake hunt , and he brought back what may be the ultimate in burglar protection : seven diamondback rattlesnakes . During business hours , he cages the snakes in the window of his business office , labeled with a sign : DANGER : SNAKES BITE . At night , before going home , he frees the 5-ft. rattlers to glide around the premises . In the morning , armed with a hooked stick and a burlap bag , he rounds them up . There were a few uneasy days when one snake disappeared-it turned up later snoozing in a dark corner-but the rattlers seem to be working like a charm against burglars . <P> When news of Fretwell 's protection ' service spread , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burn to the ground before a fireman would step inside , and City Hall eventually found an ordinance against keeping snakes uncaged inside the city limits . None of which bothers Fretwell . He and his partner have even gone out on other snake hunts and brought back about 100 rattlers to protect their business acquaintances . As a matter of fact , says Fretwell , " I heard about a fellow who 's tinkering with a cobra . " Presumably , Dallas burglars should now pack a concealed mongoose instead of a .38.
