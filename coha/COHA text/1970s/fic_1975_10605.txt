. L. Doctoroweyes away when she challenged him with her gaze . She knew her mother-in-law employed private detectives but she decided he was too shy to be a detective . He had learned where she lived and what her daily routine was , but he never approached her . She felt not intimidated by his attention but protected . Intuitively she felt his admiration like a keenness in her own breath . At night she dreamed of the little girl , woke up , thought of her . Plans for the future flashed in her mind like fireworks and quickly disappeared . She was anxious , overwrought , aroused , unaccountably happy . She would testify on her husband 's behalf and do it well . She was hopeful that he would be found guilty and locked up for life . The little girl in the pinafore held her hand but would not say anything to her . Even to Tateh she spoke few words . Tateh said no one mourns like a child , not even a lover . Evelyn realized that the old man 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had not perceived that her attentions to the little girl were helpful . One day Evelyn came for her portrait and neither father nor daughter was to be seen . Fortunately she had learned where they lived , on Hester Street , over a public bath . She went there now , walking quickly , not daring to think what was the matter . Hester Street was a teeming marketplace of peddlers who sold vegetables and fruits and chickens and breads from pushcarts lined up along the curb . The sidewalks were glutted with shoppers , overflowing garbage cans stood in ranks beside the entrance stairs of every house . Bedding hung from fire escapes . Evelyn rushed up a flight of iron stairs and into a dark incredibly foul-smelling hallway . Tateh and the little girl lived on the top floor , in two small rooms in the back . She knocked on the door . She knocked again . A moment later it opened a crack ; there was a chain latch in place . What is the matter , Evelyn said . Let me in . Tateh was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shirt and pants held up by suspenders and he wore house slippers. 1401RAGTIMEHe insisted that the front door be left open despite the rank winds that blew up the stairwell , and quickly put on his jacket and shoes . He hurriedly made up his cot , throwing over it a brightly colored spread . The little girl lay on a brass bed in the other room . She was ill with a fever . The two rooms were lit by candle . The bedroom , although it had a window , was almost as dark as the front room . It looked out on an air shaft . The whole place was no bigger than a closet . Yet as Evelyn 's eyes accustomed themselves to the darkness she perceived that the home was scrupulously clean . Her arrival had caused a storm of consternation in the old artist , who paced up and down in the candlelight and did not know what to do about her . In great agitation he smoked a cigarette which he held between his thumb and forefinger , palm up , in the European @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insisted , while you go to work . Finally the old man gave in , if only to avoid the terrible strain on himself of her presence in his home . He rushed out carrying his display stand with its black velvet curtains folded over his arms and his wooden box , like a suitcase , that held his materials . Evelyn closed the door after him . She looked at the glass cabinet , at the few cups and plates of chipped crockery . She examined the bedding in the drawers , the scrubbed oak table and chairs where the family ate . There was a pile of unfinished knee pants on a sewing machine by the bedroom window . The machine had a filigreed iron treadle . The window in the bedroomsparkled with the reflection of the candle . The brass of the thin little bed was shining . Evelyn felt a strong kinship with the departed mother . The girl looked at her from the pillows and neither smiled nor said anything . Evelyn removed the shawl , the old sweater , and put them down on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beside the bed , like an end table , books in Yiddish were stacked tightly . There were books in English too , on socialism , and pamphlets on the covers of which workingmen with powerful linked arms were marching411E . L. Doctorowforward . None of them looked like the frail white-haired ' latch . There were no mirrors on the walls and no photographs anywhere of the family , of the missing wife and mother . She found a tub of galvanized tin in the front room . She found a pail and went down the stairs and drew from the sink on the ground floor a pail of water . She warmed the water on the coal stove in the front room and went into the bedroom with the tub , the pail of water and a thin starched towel . The little girl clutched the covers about her . Evelyn gently removed the covers and sat her up on the edge of the bed and raised her nightgown and stood her up and lifted the nightgown over her head , feeling like the sun the warm exhalations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tub , she said and knelt in front of the girl and bathed her with the warm water scooping it in her hands and caressing the child with her hands of water and doing it again , on her tawny shoulders , her nut-brown budded nipples , her face , her downy back , her thin thighs , the smooth slope of her stomach , her girlhood , the sluiced water from her young fevered body falling like rain in the tub as Evelyn bathed her with her hands . Then with the towel folded in quarters she gently patted the little girl dry and dressed her afresh in another gown she had found in the drawe  --  larger gown this time of thin cotton , much too big , funny , so that the girl laughed . Evelyn smoothed the sheets and plumped up the pillows and settled the girl in the bed again and felt her foreheadand it was cool . The little girl 's dark eyes shone in the dusk . Evelyn combed her black hair and touched her face and leaned over her , and the little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kissed her on the lips . This was the day Evelyn Nesbit considered kidnapping the little girl and leaving Tateh to his fate . The old artist had never inquired of her name and knew nothing about her . It could he done . Instead she threw herself into the family 's life with redoubled effort , coming with food , linens and whatever else1421RAGTIMEshe could move past the old man 's tormented pride . She was insane with the desire to become one of them and drew Tateh out in conversation and learned from the girl how to sew knee pants . For hours each day , each evening , she lived as a woman in the Jewish slums , and was driven home by the Thaw chauffeurfrom a prearranged place many blocks away , always in despair . She was so desperately in love that she could no longer see properly , something had happened to her eyes , and she blinked constantly as if to clear them of the blur . She saw everything through a film of salt tears , and her voice became husky because her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her happiness caused her. 1431RAGTIME8One day Tateh invited her to a meeting of which the Socialist Artists ' Alliance of the Lower East Side was a part sponsor , along with seven other organizations . It was an important event . The featured speaker was to be none other than Emma Goldman . Carefully Tatch explained that although he was unalterably opposed to Goldman , she being an anarchist and he a socialist , he had great respect for her personal courage and integrity ; and that he had therefore agreed that some sort of temporary accord between the socialists and the anarchists was advisable , if only for the evening , because the funds raised for the occasion would go to support the shirtwaist makers , who were then on strike , and the steelworkers at McKeesport , Pennsylvania , who were on strike , and the anarchist Francisco Ferrer , who was going to be condemned and executed by the Spanish government for fomenting a general strike in Spain . In five minutes Evelyn was immersed in the bracing linguistics of radical idealism . She did n't dare confess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anarchism were not the same thing , or that the thought of seeing the notorious Emma Goldman frightened her . She pulled her shawl over her head , and holding the little girl 's hand tightly , walked behind ' latch1441as he strode north to the Workingmen 's Hall on East 14th Street . But she did at one point turn around to see if her strange shy admirer was following , and he was , half a block behind , his lean face hidden in the shadow of his straw boater . Emma Goldman 's subject was the great dramatist Ibsen in whose work , she said , lay all the instruments for the radical dissection of society . She was not a physically impressive woman , being small , thick-waisted , with a heavy-jawed masculineface . She wore horn-rimmed glasses that enlarged her eyes and suggested the constant outrage to her soul of the sights she saw . She had immense vitality and her voice rang , and Evelyn , after getting over her relief to discover that Goldman was simply a woman , and a rather small woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powerful ideas that lifted her mind like a river . In the heat and constant excitement rising from the audience she allowed her shawl to drop to her shoulders . There were perhaps a hundred people present , all sitting on benches or standing along the walls while Goldman spoke from behind a table at the end of the room . The police department had stationed men prominently at the doors and at one point a police sergeant tried to stop Emma 's address , claiming she had been advertised to speak on the subject of the drama but instead was talking about Ibsen . Jeers and catcalls drove him from the hall . Goldman , however , did not join the laughter , knowing from experience what an embarrassed police force inevitably did . She spoke now with great rapidity and as she spoke her eyes ranged restlessly over the audience and came to stop , again and again , on the alabaster face of Evelyn Nesbit , who sat between Tateh and the little girl in the first row on the right , a position of honor as befitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alliance . Love in freedom ! Goldman cried . Those who like Mrs. Alving have paid with blood and tears for their spiritual awakening , repudiate marriageas an imposition , a shallow empty mockery . Some of the1451RAGTIME E. L. Doctorowaudience , including Tateh , shouted No ! No ! Comrades and brothers , Goldman said , can you socialists ignore the double bondage of one-half of the human race ? Do you think the society that plunders your labor has no interest in the way you are asked to live with women ? Not through freedom but through bondage ? All the reformers talk today of the white slavery problem . But if white slavery is a problem , why is marriage not a problem ? Is there no connection between the institution of marriage and the institution of the brothel ? At mention of this word cries of Shame ! Shame ! filled the hall . Tateh had put his hands over his daughter 's ear and pressed her head to his side . A man stood and shouted . Goldman held up her hands for quiet . Comrades @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by losing our decorum to the extent that the police may have an excuse to interrupt us . People turning in their seats indeed saw now a dozen policemen in the crowd at the doors . The truth is , Goldman went on quickly , women may not vote , they may not love whom they want , they may not develop their minds and their spirits , they may not commit their lives to the spiritual adventure of life , comrades they may not ! And why ? Is our genius only in our wombs ? Can we not write books and create learned scholarship and perform music and provide philosophical models for the betterment of mankind ? Must our fate always be physical ? There sits among us this evening one of the most brilliant women in America , a woman forced by this capitalist society to find her genius in the exercise of her sexual attractio  --  nd she has done that , comrades , to an extent that a Pierpont Morgan and a John D. Rockefeller could envy . Yet her name is scandal and their names @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this society . Evelyn went cold . She wanted to pull the shawl over her head but was afraid she would draw attention to herself . She sat perfectly still , staring at her hands iii her lap . At least the woman had had the grace not to look in her1461direction as she spoke . People in the audience who were craningtheir necks trying to locate the object of Goldman 's remarkswere diverted now by a shout from the back of the hall . A phalanx of blue coats jammed through the doors . There was a scream . And suddenly the hall was pandemonium . It was a typical conclusion to an Emma Goldman speech . Police poured down the center aisle . The anarchist stood calmly behind her table and put her papers in her brief case . Evelyn Nesbit felt Tateh 's eyes upon her and turned into the glare of his judgment . He was looking at her as she had seen him look upon a roach before he stepped on it . Then his old face seel-ned to collapse into another , more complex set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last age before death , and his eyes , from the depths of his ancient skull , translated for her the whispered Yiddish that came from his broken lips : My life is desecrated by whores , is what he said . And grasping the hand of the little girl in the pinafore , he disappeared into the crowd . Evelyn stood staring after them . It seemed to her that the light was racing away from her eyes . Her hand went out for something to hold . A now familiar voice said in her ear This way , come with me , and her arm was in the grip of Goldman herself . It was a grip of iron . Goldman led her through a small door behind the speaker 's table and just before the door closed Evelyn , letting a high thin wail from her throat , looked back and saw her shy blond young shadow fighting his way furiously in her direction . I am an old hand at this , Emma Goldman said leading her down a dark stairs . This is just an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the corner from the entrance to the meeting hall . A police van passed them , its bell clanging ; it turned the corner . Come , Emma Goldman said , linking her arm , and she walked Evelyn quickly away in the opposite direction . When Mother 's Younger Brother reached the street he just managed to see the two female figures passing under a street-1471E . L. Doctorowlight two blocks away . He hurried after them . The evening was cool . The perspiration on his neck chilled him . A breeze whipped his duck trousers . He came to within a half-block of the two women and for some minutes followed them at this distance . They turned , suddenly , and went up the stone stairs of a brownstone . He ran now and when he reached the brownstonesaw that it was a rooming house . He went inside and quietly went up the stairs , not knowing what room he was looking for but sure somehow he 'd find it . On the second landing he backed into the shadowed recess of a door . Goldman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bathroom . He heard the sound of water running and found the open door to Goldman 's room . It was a small room and peeking around the door he saw Evelyn Nesbit sitting on the bed , her face in her hands . Sobs shook her body . The walls were a faded lilac print . An electric lamp at the bedside provided the only light . HearingGoldman coming back Younger Brother soundlessly darted into the room and slipped into the closet . He left the closet door slightly ajar . Goldman placed the basin of water on the bedtable and shook out a thin starched face towel . Poor girl , she said , poor girl . Why do n't you let me refresh you a bit . I 'm a nurse , you know , that 's how I support myself . I 've followed your case in the newspapers . From the beginning I found myself admiring you . I could n't understand why . She unlaced Evelyn 's high-top shoes and slipped them off . Do n't you want to put your feet up ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back on the pillows rubbing her eyes with the heels of her hand . She took the towel offered by Goldman . Oh , I hate to cry , she said . Crying makes me ugly . She wept into the towel . After all , Goldman went on , you 're nothing more than a clever prostitute . You accepted the conditions in which you found yourself and you triumphed . But what kind of a victory has it been ? The victory of the prostitute . And what have your consolations been ? The conso-I48IRAGTIMElations of cynicism , of scorn , of contempt for the human male . Why , I thought , should I feel such strong sisterhood with this woman ? After all I have never accepted servitude . I have been free . I have fought all my life to be free . And I have never taken a man to bed without loving him , without taking him in love as a free human being , his equal , giving and taking in equal portions in love and freedom . I 've probably slept with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men than you have . I bet it would shock you to know how free I 've been , in what freedomI 've lived my life . Because like all whores you value propriety . You are a creature of capitalism , the ethics of which are so totally corrupt and hypocritical that your beauty is no more than the beauty of gold , which is to say false and cold and useless . No other words could have so quickly stemmed Evelyn 's tears . She lowered the towel from her face and stared at the stout little anarchist who now paced back and forth in front of the bed as she spoke . So why should I have felt such strong bonds between us ? You are the embodiment in woman of everything I pity and abhor . When I saw you at my meeting I was ready to accept the mystical rule of all experience . You came because in such ways as the universe works , your life was destined to interact with my own . Through the vile depths of your own existence your heart has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head . You do n't understand , she said . Tears filled her eyes once again . She told Goldman about the little girl in the pinafore . She told her of Tateh and her secret life in the slums . And now I have lost them , she said . I have lost my urchin . She wept bitterly . Goldman sat down in the rocking chair beside the bed and placed her hands on her knees . She leaned toward Evelyn Nesbit . All right , if I had not pointed you out your Tateh would n't have run off . But what of it ? Do n't worry . Truth is better than lies . When you find491RAGTIME E. L. Doctorowthem again you 'll be able to deal with them honestly , as the person you really are . And if you do n't find them , perhaps that will be for the best . Who can say who are the instrumentalities and who are the people . Which of us causes , and lives in others to cause , and which of us is meant thereby to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know at one time in my life I walked the streets to sell my body ? You are the first person I have ever told . Fortunately I was spotted for the novice that I was and sent home . It was on 14th Street . I tried to look like a streetwalkerand I fooled no one . I do n't suppose the name AlexanderBerkman means anything to you . Evelyn shook her head . When Berkman and I were in our early twenties we were lovers and revolutionaries together . There was a strike in Pittsburgh . At the Homestead steel plant of Mr. Carnegie . And Mr. Carnegie decided to break the union . So he ran off for a European vacation and had his chief toady , that infamous piece of scum I lcnry Clay l+'rick , do the job . Frick imported an army of Pinkertons . The workers were on strike to protest the cutting of wages . The plant is on the Monongahela River and Frick towed his Pinkertons up the river and landed them at the plant from the river . There was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was over ten were dead and dozens and dozens were wounded . The Pinkertons were driven off . So then Frick was able to get the government working for him and the state militia came in to surround the workers . At this point Berkman and I decided on our attentat . We would give the beleaguered workers heart . We would revolutionize their struggle . We would kill Frick . But we were in New York and we had no money . We needed money for a railroad ticket and for a gun . And that 's when I put on embroidered underwear and walked 14th Street . An old man gave me ten dollars and told me to go home . I borrowed the rest . But I would have done it if I had to . It was for the attentat . It was for Berkman and the revolution . I embraced him at the station . I lc planned to shootFrick and take his own life at his trial . I ran after the departing train . We only had money for one ticket . He said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barged into Frick 's office in Pittsburgh and shot the bastard three times . In the neck , in the shoulder . There was blood . Frick collapsed . Men ran in . They took the gun . He had a knife . He stabbed Frick in the leg . They took the knife . He put something in his mouth . They pinned him to the ground . They pried . open his jaws . It was a capsule of fulminate of mercury . All he had to do was chew on the capsule and the room would have blown up and everyone in it . They held his head back . They removed the capsule . They beat him unconscious . Evelyn had sat up in bed , drawing her knees up to her chest . Goldman stared at the floor . He was in prison eighteen years , she said , many of them in solitary , in a dungeon . I visited him once . I could never bear to visit him again . And that bastard Frick survived and became a hero in the press and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was said we set back the American labor movement forty years . There was another anarchist , Most , an older man whom I revered . He denounced Berkman and me in his newspaper . The next time I saw Most at a meeting I was prepared . I had bought a horsewhip . I horsewhipped him in front of everyone . Then I broke the whip and threw it in his face . Berkman got out only last year . His hair is gone . He is the color of parchment . My darling young man walks with a stoop . His eyes are like coal pits . We are friends in principle only . Our hearts no longer beat together . What he endured in that prison I can only imagine . Living in darkness , in wet , tied up and left to lie in his own filth . Evelyn 's arm had gone out to the older woman and Goldman now took her hand and held it tightly . We know , do n't we , both of us , what it means to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other . There was silence for some moments . Of course , your man is a pervert , a parasite , a leech , 1501 1 1511E . L. Doctorowa foul loathsome sybarite , Goldman said . Evelyn laughed . An insane pig , Goldman said , with a twisted shrunken little pig 's mentality . Now they were both laughing . Yes , I hate him , Evelyn cried . Goldman grew reflective . But there are corre- spondences , you see , our lives correspond , our spirits touch each other like notes in harmony , and in the total human fate we are sisters . Do you understand that , Evelyn Nesbit ? She stood and touched Nesbit 's face . Do you see that , my beautiful girl ? As she had been talking Goldman 's eyes reacted to some- thing in Evelyn 's posture . Are you wearing a corset ? she now asked . Evelyn nodded . You ought to be ashamed of yourself . Look at me , even with my figure I have not one foundation garment , I wear everything loose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breathe and to be . That 's what I mean , you 're a creature of their making . You have no more need of stays than a wood nymph . She took Nesbit 's hands and sat her up on the edge of the bed . She felt her waist . My God , stays like steel . Your waist is pinched tighter than a purse string . Stand up . Evelyn stood up obediently and Goldman with a nurse 's expertise swiftly unbuttoned her shirtwaist and removed it . She unclasped Evelyn 's skirt and had her step out of it . She untied the strings of her petticoat and removed it . Evelyn wore a light corset around her waist . The top of the corset pushed up her bosom . The bottom was attached to straps which went between her thighs . The corset was laced in the back . It is ironic that you are thought of in homes all over America as a licentious shameless wanton , Goldman said pulling the laces out of the grommets , loosening the garment and pulling it down Evelyn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obeyed . Her undershift remained stuck to her body in the pattern of the stays . Breathe , Goldman commanded , raise your arms , stretch your legs and breathe . Evelyn obeyed . Goldman plucked at the shift , then lifted it over her head . Then she 1521 knelt and slid Evelyn 's lace-trimmed underdrawers to her feet . Step out , she commanded . Evelyn did so . She now stood nude in the lamplight except for her black embroidered cotton stockings which were held up by elastic bands around the thighs . Goldman rolled the stockings down and Evelyn stepped out of her stockings . She held her arms across her breasts . Goldman stood and turned her around slowly for inspection , a frown on her face . Look at that , it 's amazing you have any circulation at all . Marks of the stays ran vertically like welts around Nesbit 's waist . The evidence of garters could be seen in the red lines running around the tops of her thighs . Women kill themselves , Goldman said . She turned back the bedcovers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small black bag of the kind that doctors carried . A superb body like this and look what you do to it . Lie down . Evelyn sat down on the bed and looked at what was coming out of the black bag . On your stomach , Goldman said . She was holding a bottle and tilting the contents of the bottle into her cupped hand . Evelyn lay down on her stomach and Goldman applied the liquid where the marks of the stays reddened the flesh . Ow , Evelyn cried . It stings ! This is an astringen  --  he first thing is to restore circulation , Goldman explained as she rubbed Evelyn 's back and buttocks and thighs . Evelyn was squirming and her flesh cringing with each application . She buried her face in the pillow to smother her cries . I know , I know , Goldman said . But you will thank me . Under Goldman 's vigorous rubbing Evelyn'sflesh seemed to spring into its fullest conformations .

Gradually Evelyn relaxed and her flesh shook and quivered under the emphatic skill of Goldman 's hands . Goldman rubbed the oil into her skinE . L. Doctorowuntil her body found its own natural rosy white being and began to stir with self-perception . Turn over , Goldman commanded . Evelyn 's hair was now undone and lay on the pillow about her face . Her eyes were closed and her lips stretched in an involuntary smile as Goldman massaged her breasts , her stomach , her legs . Yes , even this , Emma Goldman said , briskly passing her hand over the mons . You must have the courage to live . The bedside lamp seemed to dim for a moment . Evelyn put her own hands on her breasts and her palms rotated the nipples . Her hands swam down along her flanks . She rubbed her hips . Her feet pointed like a dancer 's and her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if seeking something in the air . Goldman was now at the bureau , capping her bottled emollient , her back to Evelyn as the younger woman began to ripple on the bed like a wave on the sea . At this moment a hoarse unearthly cry issued from the walls , the closet door flew open and Mother 's Younger Brother fell into the room , his face twisted in a paroxysm of saintly mortification . He was clutchingin his hands , as if trying to choke it , a rampant penis which , scornful of his intentions , whipped him about the floor , launching to his cries of ecstasy or despair , great filamented spurts of jism that traced the air like bullets and then settled slowly over Evelyn in her bed like falling ticker tape. 9In New Rochelle , Mother had for days brooded about her brother . He had called on the telephone from New York once or twice but would not say why he had gone away or where he was staying or when he would return . He mumbled . He was close-mouthed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to anger . Since his calls she had taken the extreme step of going into his room and looking around . As always it was neat . There was his table with the machine for stringing tennis racquets . There were his scull oars in brackets on the wall . He kept his own room and there was not a speck of dust even now in his absence . His hairbrushes on the bureau top . His ivory shoehorn . A small shell shaped like a thimble , with some grains of sand stuck to it . She had never seen that before . A picture from a magazine pinned to the wall , the drawing by Charles Dana Gibson of that Evelyn Nesbit creature . He had packed nothing , his shirts and collars filled the drawer . She closed the door guiltily . He was a strange young man . He never made friends . He was solitary and impassive except for a streak of indolence which he either could not hide or did not care to . She knew Father found that indolence disturbing . Nevertheless he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Doctorow RAGTIMEShe could not share her worries with Grandfather , who had sired the young man at a late age and was now totally separated from any practical perception of life . Grandfather was in his nineties . He was a retired professor of Greek and Latin who had taught generations of Episcopal seminarians at Shady Grove College in central Ohio . He was a country classicist . He had known John Brown when he was a boy in Hudson County in the Western Reserve and would tell you that twenty times a day if you let him . More and more since Father 's departure Mother thought of the old Ohio homestead . The summers there were gravid with promise and red-winged blackbirds flew up from the hay meadows . The furnishings of the house were spare , and country-made . Ladderback chairs of pine . Polished wood floors of wide hoards fastened with dowels . She had loved that house . She and Younger Brother played on the floor by the light of the fire . In their games she always instructed him . In winter their horse Bessie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her collar and they skimmed over the thick wet Ohio snowfalls . She remembered Brother when he was younger than her own son . She took care of him . On rainy days they played secret pretending games in the hayloft , in the sweet warmth , with the horses snorting and nickering below them . On Sunday morning she wore her pink dress and the purest white pantaloons and went to church with a heart beating with excitement . She was a large-boned child with high cheekbones and gray eyes that slanted . She had lived in Shady Grove all her life except for four years at boarding school in Cleveland . She had always presumed she would marry one of the seminarians . But in her last year at school she had met Father . He was traveling through the Midwest to make local sales connections for his flag and bunting business . He called on her at Shady Grove on two successive business trips . When they married and she came East she brought her father with her . And then because Brother had not been able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And now in this season of life , alone in her modern awninged home at the top of the hill on fashionable Broadview Avenue with only her small son and her ancient father , she felt deserted by the race of males and furious with herself for the nostalgia that swept through her without warning at any hour of the day or night . A letter had arrived from the Republican Inaugural Committee inquiring if the firm would care to bid on the decoration and fireworks contract for the inauguration parade and ball the following January , when Mr. Taft was expected to succeed Mr. Roosevelt . It was an historic moment for the business and neither Father nor Younger Brother was on hand . She fled to the garden for solace . This was the late September of the year and all the heavy swaying flowers were in bloom , salvia , chrysanthemum and marigold . She walked along the borders of the yard , her hands clasped . From an upstairs windowthe little boy watched her . He noted that the forward motion of her body was transmitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swayed from side to side , brushing the leaves of grass . He held in his hand a letter from his father that had been posted from Cape York in northwest Greenland . It had been brought back to the United States by the supply ship Erik , which had transported to Greenland thirty-five tons of whale meat for Commander Peary 's dogs . Mother had copied the letter and thrown the original in the garbage because it strongly suggested the smell of dead whale . The boy had retrievedthe letter and as time passed , the grease spots on the envelope were worked into every fiber of the paper by his small hands . The letter was now translucent . As the boy watched his mother she came out of the dappled shade of the maple trees , and her golden hair , which she wore piled on her head in the style of the day , flared like the sun . She stood for a moment as if listening to something . She brought her hands up to her ears and slowly , by the flower bed , 561 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she began to paw the ground . The little boy left the window and raced downstairs . He went through the kitchen and out the back door . He found himself following the Irish housemaid , who was running through the yard wiping her hands on her apron . Mother had dug something up . She was brushing the dirt from a bundle which she held on her lap . The maid let out a scream and crossed herself . The little boy tried to get a look at it , whatever it was , but Mother and the maid were on the ground , brushing the dirt off , and for a moment he could n't get past them . Mother 's face had turned so pale and suffered such an intense expression that all the bones of her face appeared to have grown and the opulently beautiful woman he revered was shockingly haggard , like someone ancient . He saw , as they brushed the dirt away , that it was an infant . Dirt was in its eyes , in its mouth . It was small and wrinkled and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and had been bound tight in a cotton blanket . Mother freed its arms . It made a small weak cry , and the two women grew hysterical . The maid ran into the house . The boy followed his mother to the house , running alongside her as the small arms of the brown baby waved in the air . The women washed the baby in a basin on the kitchen table . It was bloody , an unwashed newborn boy . The maid examined the cord and said it had been bitten . They swaddled it in towels , and Mother ran to the front hall to phone the doctor . The boy watched the infant closely to see if it was breathing . It barely moved . Then its tiny fingers grasped the towels . Its head slowly turned as if through its closed eyes it had found something to look at . When the doctor came in his Ford Doctor 's Car he was shown into the kitchen . He held his stethoscope to the small bony rib cage . He opened the mouth and poked his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ile shook his head. 1581The muscles of his cheeks pulled in his mouth at the corners . Mother described for him the circumstances of the discovery : how she had heard a cry coming from her feet , from the earth , and thought at the moment she had heard it that she had not heard it at all . And what if I had walked on , she said to herself . The doctor asked for some hot water . He removed an instrumentfrom his bag . The maid tightly clutched the small cross that hung from her neck on a chain . The doorbell rang and the boy followed her into the front hall . The police had arrived . Mother came out and explained the circumstances once again . The policeman asked if he could use the telephone . The telephonewas on a table near the front door . He removed his helmet , picked up the phone and put the receiver to his ear and waited for the operator . He winked at the boy . Within an hour a black woman was found in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a washwoman who worked in the neighborhood . She sat outside the house in the police ambulance and Mother brought the baby out to her . When the woman took the baby in her arms she began to cry . Mother was shocked by her youth . She had a child 's face , a guileless brown beautiful face . She was the color of dark chocolate and her hair looked chopped and uncared for . She was being attended by a nurse . Mother stepped back on the sidewalk . Where will you take her , she said to the doctor . To the charity ward , he said . And eventually she will have to stand charges . What charges , Mother said . Well , attempted murder , I should think . Does she have family , Mother said . No , ma'am , the policeman said . Not so 's we know . The doctor pulled down on the rim of his derby and walked to his car and put his bag on the seat . Mother took a deep breath . I will take the responsibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ despite the best advice of the doctor and the remonstrations of the police , she would not change her mind . So the young black woman and her child were installed inE . L. Doctorowa room on the top floor . Mother made numbers of phone calls . She canceled her service league meeting . She walked back and forth in her parlor . She was very agitated . She felt keenly her husband 's absence and condemned herself for so readily endorsinghis travels . There was no way to communicate with him any of the problems and concerns of her life . She would not hear from him till the following summer . She stared at the ceiling as if to see through it . The Negro girl and her baby had carried into the house a sense of misfortune , of chaos , and now this feeling resided here like some sort of contamination . She was frightened . She went to the window . Every morning these washwomen came up the hill from the trolley line on North Avenue and fanned into the houses . Traveling Italian gardenerskept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their horses straining in their traces to pull the creaking ice wagons up the hill . When the sun set that evening it lay at the bottom of the hill as if it had rolled there . It was blood red . Late at night the boy woke and found his mother sitting beside the bed looking at him , her golden hair plaited and her large breasts soft against his arm when she leaned over to kiss him. 160110Actually Father wrote every day during the long winter months , letters for delayed transmission which took the form of entries in his journal . In this way he measured the uninterruptedflow of twilight darkness . The members of the expeditionlived in surprising comfort aboard the Roosevelt , which had been lifted in its berth by the winter floes until it sat like a walnut in icing . Peary lived the most comfortably of all . He had a player piano in his stateroom . He was a large man with a heavy torso and thick red hair turning gray . He wore a long moustache . In a previous expedition he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gait , a kind of shuffle , pushing his feet along the floor without lifting them . He pedaled his player piano with toeless feet . He was supplied with rolls of the best Victor Herbert and Rudolf Friml numbers as well as a medley of Bowdoin College songs and a version of The Minute Waltz of Chopin which he could pump out in forty-eight seconds . But the winter months were not given to idleness . There were hunting sorties for musk ox ; there were sledges to be built , and the base camp had to be set up ninety miles away , at Cape Columbia , the point from which the actual polar dash across the " sea ice would be made . Everyone had to get used to1 6 1 1handling dog teams and building igloo shelters . Peary 's Negro assistant , Mathew Henson , supervised the training . After numbersof expeditions , Peary had developed a system . Every last detail of their lives in the Arctic represented his considered judgment and was part of the system . The material and designs of the sledges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tins in which the food was to be carried , the manner in which the tins were to be lashed to the sledges , the kind of under- and overclothingthat was to be worn , the means of harnessing the dogs , the kinds of knives and guns to carry , the kinds of matches and the means of keeping them dry , the design of the eye guards to be used against snow blindness , and so on . Peary loved to discuss his system . In its essential  --  hat is , in the use of dogs and sledges and the wearing of fur clothing and the living off local faun  --  eary 's system merely adopted the Esquimo way of life . Father realized this with a start one day . As it happened he had been standing on the quarter-deck observing Peary soundly scold one of the Esquimo men who had not done his assigned chore properly . Then Peary shuffled back along the deck , passing Father and saying to him They 're children and they have to be treated like children . Father tended to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He recalled an observation made in the Philippines ten years before where he had fought under General Leonard F. Wood against the Moro guerrillas . Our little brown brothers have to be taught a lesson , a staff officer had said , sticking a campaign pin in a map . There was no question that the Esquimos were primitives . They were affectionate , gentle , emotional , trustworthy and full of pranks . They loved to laugh and sing . In the deepest part of the winter of continuous night , when terrible storms tore rocks from the cliffs , and winds shrieked , and it was so desolately cold that Father hallucinated that his skin was burning , Peary and most of the men withdrew to the theoretical considerations of his system and so protected themselves against their fear . The1621Esquimos , who had no system but merely lived here , suffered the terrors of their universe . Sometimes the Esquimo women would unaccountably tear off their clothes and run into the black storms howling and rolling on the ice . Their husbands had forcibly to restrain them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writing in his journal . This was a system too , the system of language and conceptualization . It proposed that human beings , by the act of making witness , warranted times and places for their existence other than the time and place they were living through . But there seemed in this icebound winter night a force that gripped you by the neck and faced you into it . The Esquimo families lived all over the ship , camping on the decks and in the holds . They were not discreet in their intercourse . They cohabited without even undressing , through vents in their furs , and they went at it with grunts and shouts of fierce joy . One day Father came upon a couple and was shocked to see the wife thrusting her hips upwards to the thrusts of her husband . An uncanny animal song came from her throat . This was something he could not write in his journal except in a kind of code . The woman was actually pushing back . It stunned him that she could react this way . This filthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressed upwards by her cheekbones , singing her song and pushing back . He thought of Mother 's fastidiousness , her grooming and her intelligence , and found himself resenting this primitive woman 's claim to the gender . The spring came , finally , and it was Peary 's assistant , Mathew Henson , who called to Father one morning and pointed aft . A thin ray of light was in the southern sky . In the days that followed , distinctions in the kinds of darkness could be made , and these became more and more pronounced . Finallyone morning there rose above the horizon a blurred and blood-red sun , not round but elliptically misshapen , like some-1631E . L. Doctorowthing born . Everyone became happy . Glorious colors , pink and green and yellow , lay upon the snow peaks , and the entire bleak magnificent world offered itself to who would take it . The sky gradually turned blue and Peary said the time had come to conquer the Pole . The day before the expedition was to leave , Father went along with Mathew Henson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a day 's journey from the coast . They climbed the cliffs with sealskin bags hung over their shoulders and collected dozens of eggs , a great delicacy in the Arctic . When the birds flew up , chattering and circling , it was as if a portion of the rock cliff had come away . Father had never seen so many birds . They were fulmar. and auk . The Esquimos held out nets between them and the birds flew into the nets and became entangled . The nets were taken up at the corners and became sacks of immobile weighted feathers chirping piteously . When the men had caught all they could carry , they made the descent and straightaway slaughtered the birds . The fulmar , about the size of gulls , were wrung at the neck . But what amazed Father was the means by which the small and inoffensive auk was done in . One simply nudged the tiny heart in its breast . Father watched it done and then tried it himself . He held an auk in one hand and with his thumb gently squeezed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead . The Esquimos loved the auklet and customarily pickled it in sealskins . On the way back to camp Father and Mathew Henson discussed what the men under Peary always discusse  --  ho would have the honor of actually going to the Pole with him . Before the embarkation from New York the Commander had made it quite clear to everyone that he and he alone was to discover the Pole : their glory would be in support . I 've spent my life planning for that moment , Peary said , and I 'm going to have it for myself . This seemed to Father a reasonable point of view . He had the diffidence of the amateur before **26;2322;TOOLONG . But it was Mathew Henson 's view that someone besides Esquimos would have to go to the top with the Commander , and he thought , with all due respect , it would be himself . Actually Father believed Henson had a good case . Henson had been with Peary on his previous expeditions and he was an astute and formidable Arctic explorer in his own right . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an Esquimo , he knew how to repair sledges , build camps , he had great physical strength and boasted many skills . But Father found himself unaccountably resenting Henson 's presumption and he asked the Negro how he knew he would be chosen . They had breasted a ridge along the trail and stood resting the dogs for a moment as they looked over a great white plain of snow . At that moment the sun broke through the overcast and the entire earth flashed like a mirror . Well , sir , Mathew Hensonsaid with a smile , I just know . The next day the expedition set out due north across the polar ice . They were arranged in separate parties consisting of a white man or two , a group of Esquimo boys , a pack of dogs and four or five sledges . Each party except Peary 's was to serve for a week as pioneer or trailbreaker to the rest of the expedition . Eventually , each of them was to peel off and head back to land , leaving Peary and his boys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , relatively rested condition . That was the system . The big work was in breaking trail . This was hazardous and backbreaking labor . Ridges of ice had to be hacked away with a pickax , heavy sledges had to be hauled and pushed up ice inclines and then held against precipitous descents . Each sled carried over six hundred pounds of tools and provisions . When it broke , it had to be unloaded and repaired by lashing the broken parts togethe  --  ork that required an ungloved hand . There were leads of water that had to be crossed or waited out . The ice floes came together with great cracks , like the'sound of cannon , and rumbled underfoot like the voice of1651E . L. Doctorowthe ocean itself . Inexplicable fogs blocked out the sun . Sometimesthere was nothing to do but crawl across thin sheets of forming ice ; no one wanted to be caught on a drifting ice floe . The weather was a constant torment , the wind blowing so sharply at fifty or sixty degrees below zero that the air itself seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one 's lungs . Each breath left its solid residue in the beard or on the frozen edges of the fur hoods . Everyone wore the prescribed soft sealskin shoes , the bear fur trousers and the hooded caribou jackets , but even these indigenousmaterials turned brittle in the frost . The sun now stood above the horizon twenty-four hours a day . At the end of a day 's travel , perhaps fifteen miles of arduous effort , the pioneer group would make camp , build igloos for the pursuing expedition , feed the dogs , untangle their iced-up traces , light the alcohol cooker to brew tea , and fall to a meal of frozen pemmicanand crackers . Slowly through the month of March the Peary expedition made its way due north . One by one a party would turn hack , its obligations now to beat the return trail as thoroughly as possible to make it easier for the parties who would follow . Peary would bring up the lag each day on the outgoing run and immediately occupy one of the igloos built for him by Henson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dogs , repaired broken sledges , made supper , dealt with the Esquimos , many of whom were now becoming difficult . Peary defined the virtues of Esquimos as loyalty and obedience , roughly the same virtues one sought in the dogs . When the time came for the final run for the Pole , now only a hundred miles away , Peary did indeed choose Henson to go with him ; and Henson chose the Esquimos who in his judgment were the best boys , the most loyal and devoted to the Commander . The balance of the party was turned around and sent home . Father had long since gone back . He had pioneered the very first week . He had proven not the sturdiest member of theRAGTIMEexpedition . This was from no lack of heart , as Peary told him before sending him home , but from the tendency of his extremitiesto freeze easily . Father 's left heel , for instance , froze every day , no matter what he did to protect it . Each evening in camp he would thaw it out painfully and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would freeze up again . So too with one of his knees and a small area on the top of his hand . Pieces of Father froze very casually and Peary said this was the fate of some men in the North and nothing could be done about it . Peary was not an unkind commander , and he liked Father . During the long winter months aboard the Roosevelt , they had discovered themselves members of the same national collegiate fraternity , and this was no light bond between them . But after a lifetime of effort Peary was impatient to get his task done . Father 's society had paid a good sum into the Peary chest , and for it they got their man to seventy-two degrees , forty-six minutes , a very respectable way . Before he left , Father presentedthe Commander with an American flag he had manufacturedfor the occasion . It was pure silk and a good size ; but when folded had no more bulk than a large handkerchief . Peary thanked him , put the flag inside his furs and , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him on his return journey to the Roosevelt in the company of three bad-temperedEsquimos . But now Peary was within a day 's travel of his lifelong goal . Driving Henson and the Esquimos mercilessly , he had refused to let them sleep more than an hour or two at the end of each arduous day . Now the sun shone brightly , the sky was clear ; there was a full moon in the blue sky and the great ice thighs of the earth heaved and shuddered and rose toward the moon . At midmorning of April q , Peary called a halt . He ordered Henson to build a snow shield to protect him while he took his observations . Peary lay on his stomach and with a pan of mercury and a sextant , some paper and a pencil , he calculated1661 1C71E . L. Doctorowhis position . It did not satisfy him . He walked further along the floe and took another sighting . This did not satisfy him . All day long Peary shuffled back and forth over the ice , a mile one way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one observationsatisfied him . He would walk a few steps due north and find himself going due south . On this watery planet the sliding sea refused to be fixed . He could n't find the exact place to say this spot , here , is the North Pole . Nevertheless there was no question that they were there . All the observations together indicated that . Give three cheers , my boy , he told Henson . And let 's fly the flag . Henson and the Esquimos cheered loudly but could not be heard in the howling wind . The flag snapped and rippled . Peary posed Henson and the Esquimos in front of the flag and took their picture . It shows five stubby figures wrapped in furs , the flag set iii a paleocrystic peak behind them that might suggest a real physical Pole . Because of the light the faces are indistinguishable , seen only as black blanks framed by caribou fur. 11Back home a momentous change was coming over the United States . There was a new President , William Howard Taft , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the country men began to look at themselves . They were used to drinking great quantities of beer . They customarilydevoured loaves of bread and ate prodigiously of the sausage meats of poured offal that lay on the lunch counters of the saloons . The august Pierpont Morgan would routinely consume seven- and eight-course dinners . He ate breakfasts of steaks and chops , eggs , pancakes , broiled fish , rolls and butter , fresh fruit and cream . The consumption of food was a sacramentof success . A man who carried a great stomach before him was thought to be in his prime . Women went into hospitalsto die of burst bladders , collapsed lungs , overtaxed hearts and meningitis of the spine . There was a heavy traffic to the spas and sulphur springs , where the purgative was valued as an inducement to the appetite . America was a great farting country . All this began to change when Taft moved into the White I louse . His accession to the one mythic office in the American imagination weighed everyone down . His great figure immediatelyexpressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . L. Doctorowfashion would go the other way and only poor people would be stout . In this regard , as in most others , Evelyn Nesbit was ahead of her time . Her former chief lover Stanford White had been a fashionably burly man , and her husband Harry K. Thaw though not as large was nevertheless soft and wide , but her new lover , Mother 's Younger Brother , was as lean and hard as a young tree . They made love slowly and sinuously , humping each other into such supple states of orgasm that they found very little reason to talk the rest of the time they were together . It was characteristic of Evelyn that she could not resist someone who was so strongly attracted to her . She led Younger Brother around the Lower East Side in a futile search for Tateh and the little girl . The flat on Hester Street had been abandoned . Evelyn took up the lease and paid the landlord for the pitiful furnishings . She spent hours sitting by the window on the air shaft . She would touch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blind person trying to read with her fingers . Then she would break down and he soothed by Mother 's Younger Brother in the narrow brass bed . When the trial of Harry K. Thaw began , Evelyn was photographedarriving at the courthouse . In the courtroom , where no photographers were allowed , she was drawn by artists for the illustrateds . She could hear the scratching of the steel pens . She took the witness stand and described herself at fifteen pumping her legs in a red velvet swing while a wealthy architectcaught his breath at the sight of her exposed calves . She was resolute and held her head high . She was dressed in impeccabletaste . Her testimony created the first sex goddess in American history . Two elements of the society realized this . The first was the business community , specifically a group of accountants and cloak and suit manufacturers who also dabbledin the exhibition of moving pictures , or picture shows as they were called . Some of these men saw the way Evelyn 's faceon the front page of a newspaper sold out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of magnification by which news events established certain individuals in the public consciousnessas larger than life . These were the individuals who represented one desirable human characteristic to the exclusionof all others . The businessmen wondered if they could create such individuals not from the accidents of news events but from the deliberate manufactures of their own medium . If they could , more people would pay money for the picture shows . Thus did Evelyn provide the inspiration for the concept of the movie star system and the model for every sex goddess from Theda Bara to Marilyn Monroe . The second group of people to perceive Evelyn 's importance was made up of various trade union leaders , anarchists and socialists , who correctly prophesied that she would in the long run be a greater threat to the workingman 's interests than mine owners or steel manufacturers . In Seattle , for instance , Emma Goldman spoke to an I.W.W. local and cited Evelyn Nesbit as a daughter of the working class whose life was a lesson in the way all daughters and sisters of poor men were used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her audience guffawed and shouted out lewd remarks and broke into laughter . These were militant workers , too , unionists with a radical awareness of their situation . Goldman sent off a letter to Evelyn : I am often asked the question How can the masses permit themselves to be exploitedby the few . The answer is By being persuaded to identify with them . Carrying his newspaper with your picture the laborer goes home to his wife , an exhausted workhorse with the veins standing out in her legs , and he dreams not of justice but of being rich . Evelyn did n't know what to do with such remarks . She continued to testify as she had contracted to do . She made appearances with the Thaw family and produced by means of glances and small gestures of devotion images of a wife . SheRAGTIME1701 1711E . L. Doctorowportrayed Harry as the victim of an irrepressible urge to find honor for himself and his young bride . She performed flawlessly . She heard the scratch scratch of the steel drawing pens . Legal bystanders in spectacles and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wore black . She wondered at this huge establishment of legal people who lay waiting in their lives for conventions such as this . Judges and lawyers and bailiffs and policemen and wardens and jurymen : they had all known there would be a trial for them . She heard the scratches . Waiting in the corridors were alienists prepared to testify that Harry was insane . This was the one line of defense he would not permit . He could not bring himself to do it . His august mother wanted him to make that plea . She was afraid that if he did not he would go to the electric chair . Evelyn watched him at the defense table . She wondered what in the world could ever put to ease that enraged heart . Harry kept his facial expressions keyed to the testimony . When something was funny he smiled . When it was sad he dropped his eyes . When Stanford White 's name was mentioned he furrowedhis brow . I-le arranged himself in attitudes of contrition alternated with heads-up confidence and even burning righteousness . This activity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the courtroom he was calm and courteous , the picture of rationality . It occurred to Evelyn one day that Harry might indeed love her . She was stunned . She tried to make a determination of the real truth of their relationship . Of the relationship of the three of them . For the first time she experienced acutely the sense of Stanford White 's death , the loss of Stanny . He would have been able to tell her what the truth was . He would have made a joke out of it . That was his way . He was a lusty old fuck and he loved a good laugh . She could drive him out of his mind , just as she could drive Harry out of his . But she felt more comfortable with Stanny White . He would leave her alone to1721RAGTIMEgo out and build something , whereas Harry would never leave her because he had nothing else to do . Harry was merely wealthy . She needed desperately to talk to someone and the only person she had ever been able to talk to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On her blue vellum Mrs. Harry K. Thaw stationery with raised letters she wrote Emma Goldman . What have I done ? she said in the letter . The reply came back from California where Goldman was raising funds in defense of the militant McNamara brothers who were accused of blowing up the Los Angeles Times building : Do n't overestimate your role in the relationship those two men had with each other . In the meantime Harry 's trial went to the jury . They could not come to a verdict . A new trial was ordered . Evelyn testified again , with the same words and the same gestures . When it was all over Harry K. Thaw was remanded for an indefinite period to the Matteawan Hospital for the Criminally Insane . Almost immediately his lawyers negotiated for his divorce . Evelyn was ready . Her price was a million dollars . Then the private detectives came forward with their record of her infidelitieswith Mother 's Younger Brother and some others they had made up and the divorce was quietly concluded by the payment to Evelyn of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hotel suite which she now had to give up and gazed at her evening slippers which she held in her hand . On this particular occasion Younger Brother 's endearments left her cold . She remembered what Goldman had told her on her last visit to New York . However much money you have gotten from Thaw it is only as much as he wanted to give you . It is the law of wealth that such people only profit from the money that is taken from them . It is the way things work . Somehow every dollar paid over to you has resulted in his profit . And you will be left with a finite amount of money that you will spend and waste until you are as poor as when you started . She knew1731E . L. Doctorowthis was true . Even such money as she had , still the bulk of her fortune , left her with strange and inconclusive feelings . Some man would feign love , steal the money and break her heart . For this bitter insight she had only Goldman to thank , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greed and barbarity , starvation , injustice and death , as in the present national organizationsof private capital , and the other of utopian serenity , as in the loose ungoverned combinations of equals sharing their work and their wealth sensibly with one another . Evelyn made donations to Goldman 's anarchist magazine Mother Earth , to keep it going . She supported radical appeals that came to her from all over the country once it became underground gossip that she had been politicized . She gave money to the legal defense of labor leaders who had been thrown in jail . She gave money to the parents of children mutilated in mills and factories . Listlessly she doled out her hard-earned fortune . The public never knew this because she insisted on anonymity . She had no joy . She looked into the mirror and saw the unmistakablelineaments of womanhood coming into her girlish face . Her long beautiful neck seemed to her like an ungainly stalk upon which was perched a sad-eyed ridiculous head of a whore past her prime . She cried for the snuggling opportunities of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mother 's Younger Brother solemnly and in his doggish silent way stood to wait upon her . He did n't know the meaning of comfort . He could n't tease her or talk baby talk to her . He could n't tell her how to look at a diamond , or take her to a restaurant where the maitre d ' fawned over him . All he could do was commit his life to hers and work to satisfy her smallest whim . She loved him but she wanted someone who would treat her badly and whom she could treat badly . She longed for a challenge to her wit , she longed to have her ambitions aroused once again. 74112And what of Tateh and his little girl ? After that meeting the old artist sat one night and one day in his flat and he did not eat or say anything , brooding , as he smoked endlessly his Sobranycigarettes , on the brutal luck of his life . Every once in a while he would look at his child , and seeing the sure destruction of her incredible beauty in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tears would fill his eyes . The little girl quietly prepared their simple meals in ways so reminiscent of the movements of his wife that finally he could bear the situation no longer . Throwing their few clothes in a musty suitcase whose strap had long since rotted away , he tied a piece of clothesline around the suitcase , took the girl by the hand and left the two-room flat on Hester Street forever . They walked to the corner and boarded the No. 12 streetcar for Union Square . At Union Square they transferred to the No. 8 and rode north up Broadway . The early evening was warm and all the windows ' of the trolley were lowered . The streets were crowded with cabs and cars and their horns blew at one another . Trolleys went along in clusters , their bells ringing , the flashes of electricity from their pantographs crackling along the overhead wires in minute intensifications of the heat lightning1751E . L. Doctorow , RAGTIMEthat flattened the sky over the darkening , sultry city . Tateh had no idea where he was going . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes stared solemnly at the parades of people strolling along Broadway , the men in boaters and blue blazers and white ducks , the women in white summer frocks . The electric light bulbs of each vaudeville house rippled in a particularpattern . A ring of light spun around the rims of her pupils . Three hours later they were on a streetcar moving north along Webster Avenue in the Bronx . The moon was out , the temperaturehad dropped , and the trolley clipped along the broad reaches of this wide boulevard with only occasional stops . They passed grassy lots interspersed with blocks of row houses still under construction . Finally the lights disappeared entirely and the little girl realized they were traveling along the edges of a great hillside cemetery . The stones and vaults standing against the cold night sky suggested to her the fate of her mother . For the first time she asked her Tateh where they were going . He pulled the window shut against the cold wind whistling now through the ratcheting , rocking trolley . They were the only passengers . Sha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Distributed in his pockets and in his shoes were his life savings , some thirty dollars . He had decided to leave New York , the city that had ruined his life . There was in these days of our history a highly developed system of interurban street railway lines . One could travel great distances on hard rush seats or wooden benches by taking each line to its terminus and transferring to the next . Tateh did not know anything about the routes . He only planned to keep on going as far as each streetcar would take him . In the early hours of the first morning of their trip they crossed the city line into Mount Vernon , New York , and there learned that the next service would not begin till daylight . They found a small park and slept in the band shell . In the morning they washed and refreshed themselves in a publicfacility . As the sun came up they boarded a bright red and yellow streetcar , and the conductor greeted them cheerfully . Tateh paid a nickel for himself , two cents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car , at the rear , were stacked crates filled with wet and glistening quart bottles of milk . Tateh offered to buy one . The conductor looked at him and then at the little girl and told him to take one out but did not wait to be paid for it . He pulled a cord , the trolley bell rang , and the car lurched into motion . The conductor sang . He was a robust big-bellied man with a tenor voice . He had a change-making machine strapped to his belt . A while later the streetcar entered the city of New Rochelle , New York , and slowly made its way up Main Street . Traffic was heavier now , the sun was up , and the small city was abustle . It was explained to Tateh that if he wanted to ride through he had to transfer to the Post Road Shore Line at the corner of North Avenue . This was done by paying another penny for each transfer . Tateh and the little girl got off at the corner of Main Street and North Avenue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mother passed by . The little girl looked at the boy . He was tow-headed . He wore a sailor blouse , dark blue knickers , white socks and polished white shoes . His hand was in his mother 's hand and as he passed the little girl standing with her ancient father , the boy 's eyes looked into hers . At this moment the Post Road streetcar appeared and Tateh holding the little girl firmly by the wrist walked into the street and stepped aboard . As the car moved off , the little girl watched the boy pass backward in her sight . She stood on the rear platform of the trolley car and watched him until she could no longer see him . 1 Iis eyes had been blue and yellow and dark green , like a school globe . The streetcar went up the Post Road , along the Long Island Sound shoreline to the Connecticut border . In Greenwich , Connecticut , they transferred to another car . This took them up through the cities of Stamford , Norwalk and then to1761 1771Bridgeport , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew how to tell when the end of the line was approaching . The conductor would walk back through the car and reverse the empty seats , going along the aisle and yanking the handles attached to the seat backs without breaking stride . At Bridgeportthey transferred again . The tracks turned inland . They stopped for the night in New Haven , Connecticut . They slept in a rooming house and had breakfast in the landlady 's dining room . Tateh furiously brushed his trousers and jacket and soft cap before going downstairs . He tied a bow tie around his frayed collar . He made sure the little girl wore her clean pinafore . It was a rooming house for university students and some of them were at the table . They wore gold spectacles and turtleneck sweaters . After breakfast the old artist and his daughter walked to the streetcar tracks and resumed their journey . A car of the Springfield Traction Company took them to New Britain and then to the city of Hartford . The car slowly swung through the narrow streets of Hartford , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out and touch . Then they were ; on the outskirts and racing along north to Springfield , Massachusetts . The great wooden car swayed from side to side . The wind flew in their faces . They sped along the edges of open fields from which birds started and settled as they passed . The little girl saw herds of grazing cows . She saw brown horses loping in the sun . A thin layer of chalk dust settled on her face , like a mask , whitening her complexion , bringing out her large moist eyes , the redness of her mouth , and Tateh was momentarily shocked by a vision of her maturity . The car barreled along its tracks down the side of the road , and whenever it approached an intersection its air horn blew . Once it stopped and took on a load of produce . Riders crowded the aisle . The little girl could not wait for the speed to be up . Tateh realized she was happy . She loved the trip . Holding the suitcase on his lap with just one arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiling . The wind blew in his face and filled his mouth . The car threatened to jump off the tracks . It banged from side to side and everyone laughed . Tateh laughed . He saw the village of his youth going by now , some versts beyond the meadow . There was a church steeple seen above a hill . As a child he loved wagons , he loved the rides on the big tumbrils in summer moonlight , the bodies of children falling over one another in the hard bumping wagons . He looked around at the riders on the trolley and for the first time since coming to America he thought it might be possible to live here . In Springfield they bought bread and cheese and boarded a modern dark green car of the Worcester Electric Street Railway . Tateh realized now that he was going at least as far as Boston . He computed the cost of all the fares . It would come to two dollars and forty cents for him , just over a dollar for the child . The trolley hummed along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down in the Berkshires . Stands of fir trees threw long shadows . They passed a single oarsman in a scull on a very quiet broad stream . They saw a great dripping millwheel turning slowly over , a creek . The shadows deepened . The little girl fell asleep . Tateh clutched the suitcaseon his lap and kept his eyes on the tracks ahead , shining now in the single beam of the powerful electric headlamp on the front of the car . RAGTIMETracks ! Tracks ! It seemed to the visionaries who wrote for the popular magazines that the future lay at the end of parallel rails . There were long-distance locomotive railroads and interurbanelectric railroads and street railways and elevated railroads , all laying their steel stripes on the land , crisscrossing like the texture of an indefatigable civilization . And in Boston and New York there were even railroads under the streets , new rapid-transit subway systems transporting thousands of people every day . In New York , in fact , the success of the Manhattan subway had created a demand for a line to Brooklyn . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tunnel under the East River from Brooklyn to the Battery . Sandhogs working behind a hydraulic shield excavated riverbedsilt inch by inch and installed linking sections of cast-iron tubes as they went . The digging chamber was filled with compressedair pumped in from the surface . The work was dangerous . The men who did the work , the sandhogs , were considered heroes . Working under the river they were subject to horrible destinies . One typical hazard was the blowout , a situation in which the compressed air found a weakness in the roof of the tunnel and escaped with a violent rush . One day there was ablowout so explosive that it sucked four workmen out of the tunnel and blew them through twenty feet of river silt and shot them up through the river itself forty feet into the air on the crest of a geyser . Only one of the men survived . The freak accident made headlines in all the papers , and when Harry Houdini read the accounts over his morning coffee he hurriedlydressed and rushed downtown to Bellevue Hospital where it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harry Houdini , he told the admissions desk , and I 've got to see that sandhog . Two nurses conferred behind the desk and while they did he stole a glance at the charts and ran up the stairs . You ca n't come up here , a flinty nurse told him as he strode down a ward filled with sick and dying men . Chutes of cheerful morning sun leaned like buttresses from the high dirty windows of the ward . Clustered about the bed of the heroic sandhogwas his famil  --  wife , an old mother in a babushka , two strapping sons . A doctor was in attendance . The man in the bed was swathed in bandages from his head to his feet . His arms , in casts , were supported in traction as was one encased leg . Every few moments there would issue from his head bandagesa weak or perhaps only decorous groan . Houdini cleared his throat . I 'm Harry Houdini , he said to the family , I escape for a living , that 's my profession , I 'm an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done an escape that can touch this one . He pointed to the bed . The family looked at him without expression on their stolid Slavic faces . The grandmother without taking her eyes off Houdini said something in a foreign languag  --  question it was , because one of the sons answered in kind and said Houdini 's name . They continued to look at him . I came to offer my respects , Houdini said . They all had flat faces , broad brows , eyes set widely apart . They did not return his smile . How did you get in here , the doctor said . I 'll only be a minute , Houdini said , I just want to ask him something . I think you better leave , the doctor said . Houdini turned E. L. Doctorow , RAGTIMEto the family . I want to know how it felt . I want to know what he did to get to the surface . He was the only one to make it . He must have done something . I would like to know , it means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his wallet , removed some bills . I think you could probably use this . Go ahead , take it , I would like to help . The family continued to gaze at him . A sound came from the figure on the bed . One of the sons leaned over and put his ear down . He listened a moment and nodded . He went to the other son and said something to him . They were big fellows , over six feet , with chests like barrels . No rough stuff , the doctor said . Houdini found himself lifted by the arms and walked down the aisle of the ward with his feet just failing to touch the floor . He made a decision not to resist . He knew the tricks of self-defense , there were ways he could best these oafs ; but this was a hospital after all . Houdini walked through the streets . His ears burned with humiliation . He wore a hat with the brim turned down . He wore a tight-fitting double-breasted linen jacket and he kept his hands in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brown and white shoes with pointed toes . It was a chilly autumnafternoon and most people wore coats . He moved swiftly through the crowded New York streets . He was incredibly lithe . There was a kind of act that used the real world for its stage . He could n't touch it . For all his achievements he was a trickster , an illusionist , a mere magician . What was the sense of his life if people walked out of the theatre and forgot him ? The headlines on the newsstand said Peary had reached the Pole . The real-world act was what got into the history books . Houdini decided to concentrate on his outdoor exploits . Going on tour he escaped from a packing case nailed shut and tied with ropes that had been lowered into the freezing Detroit River . He had himself lowered into rivers in Boston and Philadelphia . Ice floated in the rivers . He practiced for the freezing river escapes by sitting in his bathtub at home with blocks of1821ice dropped in there by the iceman . But nothing was changed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had gotten his start in Europe when he had been unable to crack the big-time vaudevillecircuits in the States . In some peculiar way , he still felt , the people in Europe understood him better than his own countrymen . A few days before his departure he agreed to do a benefit for old magicians and retired theatre folk . He wanted to surprise them with a new escape . He hired a team of orderliesfrom Bellevue to come up on the stage and wrap him from head to foot in bandages . This was done . Then they wound him in numbers of sheets and then they strapped him to a hospital bed . Then they poured water over him to weigh down the wrappings . Houdini escaped . The old theatre people went wild . He was unsatisfied . Houdini was to sail for Europe on the Imperator , an immenseGerman vessel with a figurehea  --  n odd thing for a modern three-stack passenger liner . The figurehead was a crowned eagle with its claws embedded in the world . Houdini 's ancient mother , Mrs. Weiss , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was a neat little woman in black . He kissed her and hugged her and kissed her hands and went up the gangplank . He ran back down the gangplank and kissed her again , holding her face in his hands and kissing her eyes . She nodded and patted him . He ran up the gangplank and waved . He was n't sure she could see him . As the great liner backed into the river he stood at the rail and waved . He waved his cap to attract her attention . It was obvious she could not see him . He shouted , ridiculously , because the ship 's engines were churning up the river water . He continued to watch her small black figure and ran around to the port deck when tugs faced the ship downriver . She stood on the pier , a frail sweet old lady , and watched the ship drift out of her vision . She enjoyed her son 's devotions . Once he had come to her and had her hold out her apron .

Doctorow I RAGTIMEShe returned by cab to their home on 113th Street to wait for himHoudini opened his European tour at the Hansa Theatre in Hamburg . The audiences were enthusiastic . The papers gave him lots of space . He had never known such feelings of dissatisfaction . He wondered why he had devoted his life to mindless entertainment . The audiences cheered . After every show there was always a small crowd at the stage entrance . He was short with them . Then one day he attended the public demonstrationof a French-made flying machine , a Voisin , a beautiful biplane with boxed wings , a box rudder and three delicately strutted bicycle wheels . The aviator flew it over a race track and landed on the infield , and the next day his feat was described in the newspapers . Houdini moved decisively . Within a week he was the owner of a new Voisin biplane . It had cost him five thousand dollars . It came complete with a French mechanic who gave instruction in the art of flying . He secured the use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the countries in which he played he always got on well with the military . Soldiers everywhere were fans of his . Each morning at dawn he would drive to the parade grounds and sit at the controls of the Voisin while the French mechanic lectured him on the function and purpose of the levers and pedals within reach of the pilot . The plane was directed by means of a large steering wheel mounted in the vertical position and attached by a shaft to the front rudder . The pilot sat behind the front rudder on a little seat between the two wings . Behind him was the engine , and behind the engine was the propeller . The Voisin was made of wood . The wings were covered in fabric stretched taut and sized with varnish . The struts connectingthe double wings were paneled with the same material . The Voisin looked like a box kite . Houdini had his name painted in block letters on the outside panels of the wings and on the rear elevators . He could hardly wait for his first flight. 1841The patient mechanic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machine aloft , maintain it in flight and land it . Every night Houdini did his act and every morning at dawn he went out for his lessons . Finally one morning when the red sky was clear and the mechanic judged the wind conditions to be right , they pushed the machine out of its shed and faced it into the breeze . Houdini climbed into the pilot 's seat , turned his cap backwards and pulled it down tight . He clutched the wheel . His eyes narrowed in concentration , he set his jaw firmly and he turned his head and nodded to the mechanic , who spun the wood propeller . The engine fired . It was an Enfield 8o-horsepower job , supposedly better than the one the Wrights themselves were using . Hardly daring to breathe , Houdini throttled the engine , idled it , throttled it again . Finallyhe held up his thumb . The mechanic ducked under the wings and pulled the wheel chocks . The craft slowly moved forward . Houdini breathed faster and faster as the Voisin picked up speed . Soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sensitive wings take on an intelligence of their own , as if a disembodied presence had joined the enterprise . The machine lifted off the ground . He thought he was dreaming . He had to willfully restrain his emotions , commanding himself sternly to keep the wings level , to keep the throttle continuously in touch with the speed of the flight . He was flying ! His feet worked the pedals , he clasped the control wheel and gently the rudder in front of him tilted down and the machine climbed the sky . He dared to look down : the earth was fifty feet below him . He no longer heard the ratcheting engine behind his ear . He felt the wind in his face and discoveredhe was shouting . The guy wires seemed to sing , the great wings above and below him nodded and dipped and played in the air with their incredibly gentle intelligence . The bicycle wheels spun slowly , idly in the breeze . He was flying over a stand of trees .

Upstairs the colored girl was withdrawn . Melancholy had taken the will out of her muscles . She did not have the strength to hold her baby . She sat all day in her attic room and watched the diamond windowpanes as they gathered the light , glowed with it and then gave it up . Father looked at her through the open door . She ignored him . He wandered through the house finding everywhere signs of his own exclusion . His son now had a desk , as befitted all young students . He thought he heard an Arctic wind but it was the housemaid Brigit pushing an electric suction cleaner across the rug in the parlor . What was strangest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave back the gaunt , bearded face of a derelict , a man who lacked a home . His shaving mirror on the Roosevelt had not revealed this . He removed his clothes . He was shocked by the outlines of his body , the ribs and clavicle , white-skinned and vulnerable , the bony pelvis , the organ hanging there redder than anything else . At night in bed Mother held him and tried to warm the small of his hack , curled him into her as she lay against his hack1911 E. L. Doctorowcradling his strange coldness . It was apparent to them both that this time he 'd stayed away too long . Downstairs Brigit put a record on the Victrola , wound the crank and sat in the parlor smoking a cigarette and listening to John McCormack sing " I Hear You Calling Me . " She was doing what she could to lose her place . She was no longer efficient or respectful . Mother marked this change from the arrival of the colored girl . Father related it to the degrees of turn in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ season , and it bewildered him . At his office he was told that the seamstresses in the flag department had joined a New York union . He put on clothes from his closet that ballooned from him as shapeless as the furs he had worn for a year . He had brought home gifts . He gave his son a pair of walrus tusks and a whale 's tooth with Esquimo carvings . He gave his wife the fur of a white polar bear . He pulled Arctic treasures from his trun  --  otebooks of his journals , their covers curling at the corners , their pages stiff as pages that have been wet ; a signed photograph of Commander Peary ; a bone harpoon tip ; three or four tins of unused te  --  ncredible treasures in the North , but here in the parlor the embarrassing possessions of a savage . The family stood around and watched him on his knees . There was nothing he had to tell them . On the Northern arc of the world was a darkness and a coldness that had crept upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return to the Roosevelt he had heard the wind howl at night and had clasped with love and gratitude the foul body , like a stinking fish , of an Esquimo woman . He had put his body into the stinking fish . The old Anglo-Saxon word he had hardly dared think of . That is what he had done . Now in New Rochelle he smelled on himself the oil of fish liver , fish on his breath , fish in his nostrils . He scrubbed himself red . He looked in Mother 's eyes to detect there his justice . He found instead a woman curious and alerted to his new being . He realized that every night since he 'd returned they had slept in1921RAGTIMEthe same bed . She was in some way not as vigorously modest as she 'd been . She took his gaze . She came to bed with her hair unbraided . Her hand one night brushed down his chest and came to rest below his nightshirt . He decided God had punishmentsin store so devious there was no sense trying to anticipatewhat they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found her ready . Her hands pulling his face to hers did not feel the tears . But the house with its bay windows and beveled corners and three dormers loomed out of the yard like a ship . The rolled awnings were lashed to the windows . He stood on the sidewalk in the morning of a brilliant November day . The fallen leaves were covered with frost and lay like lapping waves about the house . The wind blew . He had come back with a slight limp . He thought about preparing his homecoming lecture for the New York Explorers Club . He found he preferred to sit in the parlor , his feet near a small electric heater . Everyone in the family treated him like a convalescent . His son brought him beef tea . The boy had grown taller . He had lost some of his fat . He was becoming competent and useful . He intelligently discussed Halley 's Comet . Father felt childlike beside him . In the paper was the news of Teddy Roosevelt 's African safari . The great conservationist had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eight hippos , nine giraffes , forty-seven gazelles , twenty-nine zebras , and kudu , wildebeest , impala , eland , waterbuck , wart hog and bushbuck , beyond number . As for the business during Father 's absence , it seemed to have got on well . Mother could now speak crisply of such matters as unit cost , inventory and advertising . She had assumedexecutive responsibilities . She had made changes in certain billing procedures and contracted with four new sales agents in California and Oregon . Everything she had done stood up tinder his examination . He was astounded . On Moth-1931E . L. Doctorower 's bedside table was a volume entitled The Ladies ' Battle by Molly Elliot Seawell . He found also a pamphlet on the subject of family limitation and the author was Emma Goldman , the anarchist revolutionary . Down in the shop , under a translucent window , he discovered his brother-in-law hunched over a drawingtable . Mother 's Younger Brother was losing his blond hair . He was pale , and thin , and more uncommunicative than ever . Most remarkable was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifteen hours a day . He had taken for his province the fireworks division of the business and had designed dozens of new rockets , firewheels , and an unusual firecracker packed not cylindrically but in a spherical container . With its fuse looking like a stem it was named a Cherry Bomb . The two men went one morning to Younger Brother 's testing ground at the end of the trolley line , in the salt marshes . They wore heavy black coats and bowlers . Father stood on a slight rise at the edge of the tall grass . On a dried mud flat fifty yards away Younger Brother bent down and prepared his demonstration . He had arranged with Father that the first combustion would be that of the standard firecracker and the second of the cherry bomb design . He suddenly stood up , held one arm aloft and backed away a few paces . Father heard the faint pop of the firecracker after he saw a wisp of smoke erased by the wind . Younger Brother now moved forward again , bent down and backed away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms . An explosionthen occurred like a bomb . Sea gulls were suddenly wheelingthrough the air and Father felt the after-concussion as a ringing in his ears . He was quite alarmed . When Younger Brother rejoined him , his face was flushed and his eyes glistened . Father suggested that perhaps the charge was too powerful and might do injury . I do n't want to produce something that would put a child 's eye out , Father said . Younger Brother said nothing but walked back to his proving ground and lit another cherry bomb , this time standing up a hare pace or two1941from the fuse . He stood as if in a shower bath , his face upturnedto the water . He held out his arms . The bomb exploded . Again he bent down and again held out his arms . The bomb exploded . The birds turned in widening circles , soaring out over the Sound , swooping over whitecaps and hovering on the wind . The young man was in mourning . Gradually Evelyn Nesbit had become indifferent to him and when he persisted in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had gone off with a professional ragtime dancer . She left a note . They were going to put together an act . Brother brought home to his room in New Rochelle a wooden crate filled with silhouette portraits and a pair of small beige satin shoes that Evelyn had discarded . Once , standing in nothing but these shoes and white embroidered stockings , she had placed her hands on her thighs and stared at him over her shoulder . He lay on his bed for days after his return . At times he would grab himself as if to pull his sex out by the roots . He would pace his room and hold his hands over his ears and hum loudly when he heard her voice . He could not look at the silhouettes . He wanted to pack his heart with gunpowder and blow it up . Without warning one dawn he awoke with her scent in his nostrils . This of all his memories was the most vicious . He ran downstairs and threw the stack of silhouettes and the satin shoes in the trash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flag and fireworks factory . The silhouette portraits were recovered by his nephew. 1951RAGTIMERAGTIME15The boy treasured anything discarded . He took his education peculiarly and lived an entirely secret intellectual life . He had his eye on his father 's Arctic journals but would not attempt to read them unless Father no longer cared about them . In his mind the meaning of something was perceived through its neglect . He looked over the silhouettes , examining them carefully , and chose one of them to hang on the inside of his wardrobe door . It was a study of the artist 's most frequent model , a girl with hair like a helmet and the posture of someone who might run at any moment . She wore the battered high-lace shoes and sagging socks of poor children . He hid the rest of the silhouette collection in the attic . He was alert not only to discarded materials but to unexpected events and coincidences . He learned nothing at school but he did well because nothing was demanded of him . His teacher was an iron-haired woman who trained her students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their notebooks the curved lines that were thought to encourage good penmanship . At home he showed a fondness for the Motor Boys books and rarely missed an issue of Wild West Weekly , and for some reason these tastes , which the family found unexceptional , were a comfort1961to them . Mother suspected he was a strange child , although she shared this sense of him with no one , not even Father . Any indication that her son was ordinary heartened her . She wished he had friends . Father was still not himself and Younger Brother was too tormented by his own concerns to be of use , so it was left to Grandfather to cultivate what might be the boy 's oddity or merely his independence of spirit . The old man was very thin and stooped , and he emitted a mildewed smell , possibly because he had few clothes and refused to buy or accept anything new . Also his eyes were constantly watering . But he would sit in the parlor and tell the boy stories from Ovid . They were stories of people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stories of transformation . Women turned into sunflowers , spiders , bats , birds ; men turned into snakes , pigs , stones and even thin air . The boy did not know he was hearing Ovid , and it would not have mattered if he had known . Grandfather 's stories proposed to him that the forms of life were volatile and that everything in the world could as easily be something else . The old man 's narrative would often drift from English to Latin without his being aware of it , as if he were reading to one of his classes of forty years before , so - that it appeared nothing was immune to the principle of volatility , not even language . The boy thought of his grandfather as a discarded treasure . He accepted the stories as images of truth , and therefore as propositions that could be tested . He found proof in his own experience of the instability of both things and people . He could look at the hairbrush on the bureau and it would sometimesslide off the edge and fall to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it might shut itself at the moment he thought the room was getting cold . He liked to go to the moving picture shows downtown at the New Rochelle Theatre on Main Street . He knew the principles of photography but saw also that moving pictures depended on the capacity of1971E . L. Doctorowhumans , animals or objects to forfeit portions of themselves , residues of shadow and light which they left behind . He lis- tened with fascination to the Victrola and played the same record over and over , whatever it happened to be , as if to test the endurance of a duplicated event . And then he took to studying himself in the mirror , perhaps expecting some change to take place before his eyes . He could not see that he was taller than he had been even a few months before , or that his hair was darkening . Mother noticed his new attention to himself and understood it as the vanity of a boy beginning to think of himself as a man . Certainly he had passed the age of sailor suits . Always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleased . In fact he continued the practice not from vanity but because he discovered the mirror as a means of self-duplication . He would gaze at himself until there were two selves facing one another , neither of which could claim to be the real one . The sensation was of being disembodied . He was no longer anything exact as a person . He had the dizzying feeling of separating from himself endlessly . He would en- trance himself so deeply in this process that he would be unable to come out of it even though his mind was lucid . He would have to rely on some outside stimulus , a loud noise or a change in the light coming through the window , to capture his attention and make him whole again . And what of his own father , the burly self-confident man who had gone away , and came back gaunt and hunched and bearded ? Or of his uncle shedding his hair and his lassitude ? Down at the bottom of the Broadview Avenue hill one day the city fathers unveiled a bronze statue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a square-topped hat , a cape , pantaloons and buckled shoes . The family was on hand for that . There were other statues in the city parks and the boy knew them all . He believed that statues were one way of transforming humans and in some cases horses . Yet even stat-1981 ues did not remain the same but turned different colors or lost bits and pieces of themselves . It was evident to him that the world composed and recomposeditself constantly in an endless process of dissatisfaction . The winter turned extremely cold and dry and the ponds of New Rochelle became ideal for skating . On Saturdays and Sundays , Mother and Younger Brother and the boy would skate on the pond in the woods at the bottom of Paine Avenue , the street adjoining Broadview . Younger Brother would skate off by himself , taking long solemn and graceful strides across the ice , his hands behind his back , his head bowed . Mother wore a fur hat and a long black coat and held her hands in a muff and skated with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his lonely indoor pursuits . It was a merry scene with children and adults from all over the neighborhood skatingover the white ice , long colorful scarves streaming from their necks , cheeks and noses red . People fell and laughed and were picked up . Dogs struggled to keep their balance as they followed the children about . There was the constant cut-cut of the skate blades on the ice . Some families had wicker chairs on runners for the elderly or less daring , and these were pushed about with solicitude . But the boy 's eyes saw only the tracks made by the skaters , traces quickly erased of moments past , Tourneys taken . RAGTIME16This same winter found Tatch and his daughter in the mill town of Lawrence , Massachusetts . They had come there the previous autumn , having heard there were jobs . Tateh stood in front of a loom for fifty-six hours a week . His pay was just under six dollars . The family lived in a wooden tenement on a hill . They had no heat . They occupied one room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He feared she would fall victim to the low-class elements of the neighborhood . He refused to enroll her in schoo  --  t was easier here than in New York to avoid the authoritie  --  nd made her stay home when he was not there to go out with her . After work he 'd walk with her for an hour through the dark streets . She became thoughtful . She held her shoulders straight and walked like a woman . He was torturing himself anticipating her maturity . At such time when the girl becomes a woman she needs a mother to instruct her . Would she have to go through this difficult change alone ? Alternatively , if he found someone to marry , how would she take to the new person ? It might be the worst thing in the world for her . The dismal wooden tenements lay in endless rows . Everyone from Europe was ther  --  he Italians , the Poles , the Belgians , the Russian Jews . The feeling was not good between the differentgroups . One day the biggest of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short pay , and a tremor went through the workers in the plant . Several Italian workers left their machines . They ran through the mill calling for a strike . They pulled out wires and threw lumps of coal through the windows . Others followed them . The anger spread . Throughout the city people left their machines . Those who could n't make up their minds were carried along in the momentum . In three days every textile mill in Lawrence was virtually shut down . Tateh was overjoyed . We were going to starve to death or freeze to death , he told his daughter . Now we 'll be shot to death . But people from the I.W.W. who knew how to run a strike quickly came up from New York and organized things . A strike committee was formed with every one of the races represented and the message went out to the workers : no violence . Taking the girl with him Tateh joined the thousands of pickets encircling the mill , a massive brick building that went on for blocks . They trudged under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ street , the drivers peering at the sight of thousands of marchers moving silently through the snow . Overhead the telephone and telegraph wires drooped with ice . Militia with rifles nervously guarded the mill gates . The militia all had overcoats . There were many incidents . A woman worker was shot in the street . The only ones with guns were the police and the militia , but the two strike leaders , Ettor and Giovanetti , were arrested for complicity in the shooting . They were put in jail pending their trial . Something of the sort had been expected . Tateh went down to the train station to be on hand for the arrival in Lawrence of replacements for Ettor and Giovanetti . There was an immense crowd . Out of the train stepped Big Bill Maywood , the most famous Wobbly of them all . Ile was aI1(x)1 I101IE . L. DoctorowWesterner and wore a stetson which he now removed and waved . A cheer went up .

Afterwardeveryone marched through the streets and sang the Internationale . The girl had never seen her Tateh so inflamed . She liked the strike because it got her out of the room . She held his hand . But the battle went on week after week . Relief committees had set up kitchens in every neighborhood . It 's not charity , a woman told Tateh when , after the child received her portion , he refused his . The bosses want you weak , therefore you have to be strong . The people who help us today will need our help tomorrow . On the picket line each cold day they wrapped their scarves around their necks and stamped their feet in the cold snow . The girl 's little cloak was threadbare . Tateh volunteered for service on the strike display committee and got them off the cold streets by designing posters . The posters were very beautiful . But the man in charge told him they were not right . We do n't want art , the man said . We want something to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stoked . Tateh had drawn pickets , stark figures with their feet in snow . He had drawn families huddled in their tenements . He switched to lettering . All for one and one for all . He felt better . At night he took home scraps of paper , oak tag , pens and India ink , and to take the child 's mind off their troubles he began to entertain her with silhouette drawings . He created a streetcar scene , the people getting on and off . She loved it . She leaned it against her bed pillow and looked at it from different angles . This gave him an inspiration . He did several studies of the streetcar and when he held them together and flipped the pages it appeared as if the streetcar came down the tracks from a distance and stopped so that the people could get on and off . His own delight matched the girl 's . She gazed at him with such sereneX1021approval that he had a fever to create for her . He brought home more scrap paper . He imagined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hundred and twenty silhouettes on pages not bigger than his hand . He bound them with string . She held the little book and governed the pages with her thumb and watched herself skating away and skating back , gliding into a figure eight , returning , pirouetting and making a lovely bow to her audience . Tateh held her and wept to feel her frail body , her soft lips on his face . What if the truth was that he could do nothing more for her than make pictures ? What if they just went on this way in varying degrees of unrealized hope ? She would grow up and curse his name . Meanwhile the strike had become famous . Reporters arrived daily from all over the country . Support was coming in from other cities . But there was a growing weakness in the unity of the strike front . A man with children found it difficult to keep his courage and resolve . A plan was put into effect whereby children of strikers were to be sent to other cities to board with families in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and New York and Philadelphia offered to take them in . Others sent money . Every family was carefully checked by the strike committee . The parents of the children had to sign permission forms . The experiment began . Wealthy women came up from New York to escort the first hundred on the train . Each child had had a medical examination and wore a new outfit of clothes . They arrived at Grand Central Station in New York like a religious army . A crowd met them and for a moment everyone held the picture of the children hand in hand staring resolutely ahead as if toward the awful fate industrialAmerica had prepared for them . The press coverage was enormous . The mill owners in Lawrence realized that of all the stratagems devised by the workers this one , the children 's crsade , was the most damaging . If it was allowed to go on , national sentiment would swing to the workingmen and the E. L. Doctorowowners would have to give in . This would mean an increase in wages that would bring some workers up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay for overtime and for machine speed-ups . They would get off without any punishment for their strike . It was unthinkable . The mill owners knew who were the stewards of civilization and the source of progress and prosperity in the city of Lawrence . For the good of the country and the American democratic system they resolved there would be no more children 's crusades . In the meantime Tateh debated with himself : Clearly the best thing for his girl would be to have a place for a few weeks with a settled family . She would be properly fed , she would be warm , and she would get a taste of a normal home life . But he could n't bear to part from her . The thought gave him forebodings . He went down to the relief committee , a storefrontnot far from the mill , and talked to one of the women there . She assured hint they had more good working-class familieswho had volunteered to board a child than they knew what to do with . Jewish ? Tateh said . You name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could n't bring himself to sign the papers . Every family is investigated , the woman told him . Could we be careless about such things ? I 've been a socialist all my life , Tateh assured her . Of course , the woman said . A doctor will listen to her chest . For that alone it 's worthwhile . She 'll eat hot meals and know her father has friends in the world . But no one 's pushing you . Look , look at the line behind you , plenty of customers . Tateh thought Here I am in the middle of brotherhood in action and I 'm thinking like some bourgeois from the shtetl . He signed the permission papers . One week later he took the girl down to the railroad station . She was in a contingent of two hundred going to Philadelphia . She was wearing a new cloak and a hat that kept her cars warm . He kept stealing glances at her . She was beautiful . She had a11041RAGTIMEnaturally regal posture . She was enjoying her new clothes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurt . She had accepted the idea of leaving him without one word of protest . Of course , this was good for all concerned . But if she found it so easy , what would the future bring ? She had reserves of character he did not elicit from her . She attracted people . Many of the mothers stared . Tateh was proud , but frightened too . They stood in the waiting room , a pandemonium of mothers and children . Someone called Here it comes ! and the crowd surged to the doors as the train slid in chuffing and hissing great clouds of steam . A car reserved for the children was attached to the end of the train . This was the Boston and Maine line . The engine was a Baldwin 4-6-o . Everyone moved down the platform , the registered nurses from the Philadelphia Women 's Committee at the head of the procession . Do n't forget your manners , Tateh said as they followed along . When people ask you a question answer them . Speak up so they can hear you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out on the street a line of militia with their blocked hats . They held their rifles across their chests . They were facing away from the platform . The procession stopped and backed up on itself . There was some sort of commotion at the front of the line . Then he heard a scream , police appeared everywhere , and suddenly the crowd was in a terrible turmoil . While amazed passengers looked out from the windows of the train the police started to separate the mothers from their children . They were dragging the mothers kicking and screaming to trucks at the end of the platform . The trucks were army Reo 's with pagoda hoods and chain wheel drive . Children were being stepped on . They scattered in all directions . A woman ran by with blood coming from her mouth . Steam drifted back from the engine like patches of fog . The bell quietly rang . A woman appeared in front of Tatch . She tried to say something . She was holding her stomach . SheI105Ifell . Tateh lifted his daughter bodily and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , out of harm 's way . Then he turned his attention to the fallen woman . He picked her up under the shoulders and dragged her through the crowd to a bench . As he was sitting her down he came to the attention of one of the policemen . The policeman cracked him on the shoulders and the head with his stick . What are you doing , Tateh cried . He did n't know what the maniac wanted of him . He moved back into the crowd . He was followed and beaten . He stumbled away from the crowd and was still beaten . Finally he fell . The authority for this police action was an order issued by the city marshal prohibiting all children from leaving Lawrence , Massachusetts . It was for their own good . They were on their knees , holding the prostrate forms of their bloodied parents . Some were in hysterics . In a few minutes the police had swept the platform clean , the trucks were driven off , the militia were marched away , and only a few sobbing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He leaned against a pillar to regain his strength . His mind was not clear . He began to hear sounds that had been made minutes before . He heard the little girl 's voice : Tateh , Tateh ! At that moment it occurred to him that the station platform was unnaturally bright . The train was gone . The realization struck his heart like a chord . He was now completely alert . Still he heard the voice . Tateh , Tateh ! He looked down the tracks and saw the last car of the train to Philadelphia some yards beyond the end of the station . It was not moving . He started to run . Tateh , Tateh ! As he ran the train slowly began to move . He ran onto the tracks . He ran , stumbling , with his arm out . His hands caught the guardrail of the observation platform . The train was picking up speed . His feet were coming off the ground . The ties began to blur under him . He clung to the railing , finally hoisting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head pressed against the bars like a man in prison begging to be set free . Tateh was rescued by two conductors who lifted him by the arms and the seat of his pants onto the observation platform . First they had to pry his fingers from the railings . He found his daughter on the train and ignoring everyone around her , conductors , passengers , he gathered her in his arms and wept . Then he noticed that her new cloak was bloody . He looked at her hands . They were smeared with blood . Where are you hurt ! he shouted . Where are you hurt ! She shook her head and pointed at him and he realized that the blood all over her was his own . It came from his scalp , blackening his white hair . A doctor who happened to be on board tended Tateh 's injuries and gave him an injection . After that he was n't too clear about what happened . He slept lying on his side across two seats with his arm for a pillow . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting in the seat facing him . She looked out the window . They were the only passengers in the special car for Philadelphia . Sometimes he heard voices but he could not bestir himself to understand what they said . At the same time he clearly saw her eyes with hills of snow proceeding slowly , in a curve , over her pupils . In this way he made the trip south to Boston , then to New Haven , through the WestchesE . L. Doctorowter towns of Rye and New Rochelle , through the train yards of New York , across the river to Newark , New Jersey , and then to Philadelphia . When the train arrived the two refugees found a bench in the station and spent the night there . Tateh was not entirely himself . He had in his pockets , fortunately , that part of his week 's wages he had set aside for the rent : two dollars and fifty cents . The girl sat beside him on the shiny bench and watched the patterns made by the people moving through the station @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ porter pushing a big broom across the marble floor . As always she seemed to accept totally the situation in which she found herself . Tateh 's head ached . His hands were swollen and scraped . He sat with his palms cupping his ears . He did n't know what to do . He could n't think . Somehow they were in Philadelphia . In the morning he picked up a discarded newspaper . On the front page was an account of the police terror in Lawrence , Massachusetts . Ike found his cigarettes in their box in his pocket and smoked and read the paper . An editorial called for an investigation of the outrage by the Federal Government . So that was it , the strike would be won . But then what ? He heard the clacking of the looms . A salary of six dollars and change . Would that transform their lives ? They would still live in that wretched room , in that terrible dark street . Tateh shook his head . This country will not let me breathe . In this mood he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lawrence , Massachusetts . His belongings , his rags , he would leave to the landlord . What do you have with you , he said to his daughter . She showed him the contents of her small satche  --  hings she had taken for her trip away from home . Her underthings , her comb and brush , a hair clasp , garters , stockings , and the books he had made for her of the trolley car and the skater . From this moment , perhaps , Tateh began to conceive of his life as sepa-108RAGTIMErate from the fate of the working class . I hate machines , he said to his daughter . He stood and she stood and took his hand and together they looked for the exit . The I.W.W. has won , he said . But what has it won ? A few more pennies in wages . Will it now own the mills ? No . They cleaned and refreshed themselves in the public lavatories . They went to the station cafe for a breakfast of rolls and coffee and spent the day walking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sun was shining . They looked in the windows of the stores and when their feet began to ache from the cold they walked into a department store to warm up . It was a vast emporium , every aisle crowded with shoppers . The girl noticed with interest that wire baskets swung from moving cables over the counters . They carried the money and receipts back and forth from the counters to the cashier . The sales clerks yanked on wooden-handled rope pulls to bring the baskets down and pulled on other ropes to get them back up . Mannequins , like grown-up dolls , sported satin toques and broad-brimmed hats plumed with egret feathers . One of these hats is more than a week 's wages , Tateh said . Later , on the streets again , they walked past iron-front buildingswhere trucks were pulled up to warehouse platforms . The windows of supply companies and wholesalers offered little of interest . But then her eye was attracted to the dirty window in which were displayed all the gimcracks of a mail-order noveltycompany . At this time businessmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tricks . There were exploding cigars , rubber roses for the lapel that squirted water , boxes of sneezing powder , telescopes that left black eyes , explodingcard decks , sound bladders for placing under chair cushions , glass paperweights with winter scenes on which snow fell when you shook them , exploding matches , punchboards , little lead liberty bells and statues of liberty , magic rings , ex-109 E. L. Doctorowploding fountain pens , books that told you the meaning of dreams , rubber Egyptian belly dancers , exploding watches , exploding eggs . Tateh stared at the window long after the girl 's interest had waned . He led her into the store . Tateh removed his hat and spoke to a man in a striped shirt with sleeve garters who came forward to meet them . The man was amiable . Sure , he said , let 's see it . Tateh took the girl 's satchel , put it on the counter and , opening it , withdrew the book of the skater . Standing next to the proprietor he held the book at arm 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skated forward and skated away , did a figure eight , came hack , went into a pirouette and made a graceful bow . The man 's eyebrows went up . He stuck out his lower lip . Let me try that , he said . An hour later Tatch walked out of there with twenty-five dollars in cash and a letter of agreement which he had signed calling for four more books at twenty-five dollars each . The compan  --  ts name was the Franklin Novelty Company ? would publish the hooks and add them to its line . For purposes of the contract they were called movie books . Come , Tateh said to his child , we 'll find a boardinghouse in a good neighborhood and then we 'll have ourselves a meal and a hot bath. 18Thus did the artist point his life along the lines of flow of American energy . Workers would strike and die but in the streets of cities an entrepreneur could cook sweet potatoes in a bucket of hot coals and sell them for a penny or two . A smiling hurdy-gurdy man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the snow , cut away the fingers of his gloves and played under the lighted windows of mansions . Frank the Cash Boy kept his eyes open for a runaway horse carrying the daughter of a Wall Street broker . All across the continent merchants pressed the large round keys of their registers . The value of the duplicable event was everywhere perceived . Every town had its ice-cream soda fountain of Belgian marble . Painless Parker the Dentist everywhere offered to remove your toothache . At Highland Park , Michigan , the first Model T automobile built on a moving assembly line lurched down a ramp and came to rest in the grass under a clear sky . It was black and ungainly and stood high off the ground . Its inventor regarded it from a distance . His derby was tilted back on his head . He chewed on a piece of straw . In his left hand he held a pocket watch . The . employer of many men , a good number of them foreignhorn , he had long believed that most human beings were tooE . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conceived the idea of breakingdown the work operations in the assembly of an automobile to their simplest steps , so that any fool could perform them . Instead of having one man learn the hundreds of tasks in the building of one motorcar , walking him hither and yon to pick out the parts from a general inventory , why not stand him in his place , have him do just one task over and over , and let the parts come past him on moving belts . Thus the worker 's mentalcapacity would not be taxed . The man who puts in a bolt does not put on the nut , the inventor said to his associates . The man who puts on the nut does not tighten it . He had a way with words . He had gotten his inspiration from a visit to a beef-packing concern where the cows were swung through the plant hanging in slings from overhead cables . With his tongue he moved the straw from one corner of his mouth to the other . He looked at his watch again . Part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not as quick-witted as they . He brushed the grass with the tip of his shoe . Exactly six minutes after the car had rolled down the ramp an identical car appeared at the top of the ramp , stood for a moment pointed at the cold early morning sun , then rolled down and crashed into the rear of the first one . Henry Ford had once been an ordinary automobile manufacturer . Now he experiencedan ecstasy greater and more intense than that vouchsafedto any American before him , not excepting Thomas Jefferson . He had caused a machine to replicate itself endlessly . His executives and managers and assistants crowded around him to shake his hand . Tears were in their eyes . He allotted sixty seconds on his pocket watch for a display of sentiment . . Then he sent everyone back to work . He knew there were refinements to be made and he was right . By controlling the speed of the moving belts he could control the workers ' rate of production . He did not want a worker to stoop over or to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worker ' musthave every second necessary for his job but not a single unnecessarysecond . From these principles Ford established the final proposition of the theory of industrial manufactur  --  ot only that the parts of the finished product be interchangeable , but that the men who build the products be themselves interchangeableparts . Soon he was producing three thousand cars a month and selling them to the multitudes . He was to live a long and active life . He loved birds and animals and counted among his friends John Burroughs , an old naturalist who studied the humble creatures of the woodlan  --  hipmunk and raccoon , junko , wren and chickadee . RAGTIME11121RAGTIME19But Ford 's achievement did not put him at the top of the business pyramid . Only one man occupied that lofty place . The offices of the J. P. Morgan Company were at 23 Wall Street . The great financier came to work one morning dressed in a dark blue suit , a black overcoat with a collar of lamb 's wool and a top hat . He affected fashions slightly out of date . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around his feet . One of the several bank officers who had rushed out to meet him disentangled the robe and hung it over the robe rail on the inside of the door . The chauffeur thanked him profusely . Somehow the speaking tube had come off its hook and another officer of the bank replaced it . In the meantime Morganhad marched into the building , assistants , aides and even some of the firm 's customers circling him like birds . Morgan carried a gold-headed cane . He was at this time in his seventyfifthyear of lif  --  burly six-footer with a large head of sparse white hair , a white moustache and fierce intolerant eyes set just close enough to suggest the psychopathology of his will . Acceptingthe obeisances of his employees , he strode to his office , a modest glass-paneled room on the main floor of the bank where he was visible to everyone and everyone to him . Ile washelped with his hat and coat . He was wearing a wing collar and an ascot . He sat down behind his desk , and ignoring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he looked at , said to his aides I want to meet that tinkering fellow . What 's his name . The motorcar mechanic . Ford . He had sensed in Ford 's achievement a lust for order as imperial as his own . This was the first sign given to him in some time that he might not be alone on the planet . Pierpont Morganwas that classic American hero , a man born to extreme wealth who by dint of hard work and ruthlessness multiplies the family fortune till it is out of sight . He controlled 741 directorships in i 12 corporations . He had once arranged a loan to the United States Government that had saved it from bankruptcy . He had single-handedly stopped the panic of 1907 by arranging for the importation of one hundred million dollars in gold bullion . Moving about in private railroad cars or yachts he crossed all borders and was at home everywhere in the world . He was a monarch of the invisible , transnational kingdomof capital whose sovereignty was everywhere granted . Commanding resources that beggared royal fortunes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their territory while he took control of their railroads and shipping lines , banks and trust companies , industrial plants and public utilities . For years he had surrounded himself with parties of friends and acquaintances , always screening them in his mind for the personal characteristics that might indicate less regard for him than they admitted . He was invariably disappointed . Everywhere men deferred to him and women shamed themselves . He knew as no one else the cold and barren reaches of unlimited success . The ordinary operations of his intelligence and instinct over the past fifty years had made him preeminent in the affairs of nations and he thought this said little for mankind . Only one thing served to remind Pierpont Morgan of his humanity and that was a chronic skin disease that had11141 11151E . L. Doctorowcolonized his nose and made of it a strawberry of the awardwinninggiant type grown by California 's wizard of horticultureLuther Burbank . This affliction had come to Morgan in his young manhood . As he grew older and richer the nose grew larger . He learned to stare down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his life , when he arose , he examined it in the mirror , finding it indeed loathsome but at the same time exquisitelysatisfying . It seemed to him that every time he made an acquisition or manipulated a bond issue or took over an industry , another bright red pericarp burst into bloom . His favorite story in literature was a tale of Nathaniel Hawthorne 's entitled " The Birthmark , " which told of an extraordinarily lovely woman whose beauty was perfect except for a small birthmark on her cheek . When her husband , a natural scientist , made her drink a potion designed to rid her of this imperfection , the birthmark disappeared ; but as its last faintest outline vanished from her skin and she was perfect , she died . To Morgan , the disfigurement of his monstrous nose was the touch of God upon him , the assurance of mortality . It was the steadiest assurance he had . Once , years before , he had arranged a dinner party at his residence on Madison Avenue in which his guests were the dozen most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the collected energy of their minds might buckle the walls of his home . Rockefeller startled him with the news that he was chronically constipated and did a lot of his thinking on the toilet . Carnegie dozed over his brandy . Harriman uttered inanities . Gathered in this one room the business elite could think of nothing to say . How they appalled him . How his heart quaked . He heard through his brain the electric winds of an empty universe . He ordered the servants to place garlands of laurel on every pate and crown . Without exception the dozen most powerful men in America looked like horse 's asses . ButRAGTIMEthe pomposity that had accrued with their wealth persuaded them that perhaps these ridiculous vines held some significance . Not one of the women thought to laugh . They were hags . They sat on their large draped behinds , breasts drooping under their decolletage . Not an ounce of wit among them . Not a light in their eyes . They were the loyal wives of great men and the hard pull of rampant achievement had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his feelings Morgan hid behind his fierce and doughty expression . A photographer was summoned to make a picture . There was a flas  --  he solemn moment was recorded . He fled to Europe , embarking on the White Star liner Oceanic . He had combined the White Star Line , the Red Star Line , the American , Dominion , Atlantic Transport and Leyland lines into one company numbering 120 oceangoingships . He despised competition no less on the seas than on land . He stood at night by the ship 's rail , hearing the heavy sea , feeling its swell but not seeing it . The sea and the sky were black and indistinguishable . A bird , some sort of gull , appeared from the blackness and lighted on the rail a few feet from him . Perhaps it had been attracted by his nose . I have no peers , Morgan said to the bird . It seemed an indisputable truth . Somehow he had catapulted himself beyond the world 's value system . But this very fact lay upon him an awesome responsibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brethren he would build a cathedral , St. John the Divine , on West i ioth Street in New York . For his wife and grown children he would continue to provide an image of domestic stolidity . And for the sake of the country he would live in as grand a style as he could summon , dining with kings , or buying art in Rome and Paris , or consorting with beautiful companionsat Aix-les-Bains. 116 1117 E. L. DoctorowMorgan had kept his vows . He spent six months of every year in Europe , moving in majesty from one country to another . The holds of his ships were filled with collections of paintings , rare manuscripts , first editions , jades , bronzes , autographs , tapestries , crystal . He looked into the eyes of Rembrandtburghers and Greco prelates as if to find kingdoms of truth that would bring him to his knees . He fingered the illustrated texts of rare Bibles of the Middle Ages as if to pick up dust from the City of God . He felt if there was something more than he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the present , of whose total bankruptcy of existence he was confident . He was the present . He employed curators to find him art and scholars to teach him of ancient civilizations . He beat his way back through the Flemish tapestries . He fondled Roman statuary . He strode through the Acropolis kicking the loose stones . His desperate studies settled , inevitably , on the civilizations of ancient Egypt , wherein it was taught that the universe is changeless and that death is followed by the resumption of life . He was fascinated . His life took a new turn . He funded Egyptianarchaeological expeditions of the Metropolitan Museum . He followed the reclamation from the dry sands of every new stele , amulet and canopic jar containing viscera . He went to the valley of the Nile where the sun never fails to rise nor the river to flood its banks . He studied the hieroglyphs . One evening he left his hotel in Cairo and rode seven miles on a special streetcar to the site of the Great Pyramid . In the clear blue light of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given to the great Osiris that there is a sacred tribe of heroes , a colony from the gods who are regularly born in every age to assist mankind . The idea stunned him . The more he thought about it the more palpably he felt it . It was upon his return to America that he began to think about Henry Ford . He had no illusions that Ford was a gentleman . He recognized him for a shrewd provincial , as uneducated as a piece of wood. 11181RAGTIMEBut he thought he saw in Ford 's use of men a reincarnation of pharaohism . Not only that : he had studied photographs of the automobile manufacturer and had seen an extraordinary resemblance to Seti I , the father of the great Ramses and the best-preserved mummy to have been unearthed from the necropolisof Thebes in the Valley of the Kings . I119IRAGTIMEMorgan 's residence in New York City was No. 219 Madison Avenue , in Murray Hill , a stately brownstone on the northeast corner of 36th Street . Adjoining it was the white marble MorganLibrary , which he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collected on his travels . It had been designed in the Italian Renaissance style by Charles McKim , a partner of Stanford White 's . The marble blocks were fitted without mortar . A snowfall darker than the stones of the Librarylay on the streets the day Henry Ford arrived for lunch . All the sounds of the city were muffled by the snow . A city policeman was stationed at the door of the residence . Across the street and on every corner of 36th and Madison small groups of men with their coat collars turned up stood staring at the great man 's home . Morgan had ordered a light lunch . They did not say much as they dined without other company on Chincoteagues , bisque of terrapin , a Montrachet , rack of lamb , a Chateau Latour , fresh tomatoes and endives , rhubarb pie in heavy cream , and coffee . The service was magical , two of Morgan 's house staff making dishes appear and disappear with such self-effacement as to suggest no human agency . Ford ate wellbut he did not touch the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frankly at the Morgan nose . He found a crumb on the tablecloth and deposited it in the saucer of his coffee cup . His fingers idly rubbed the gold plate . At the conclusion of lunch Morgan indicated to Ford that he would like him to come to the Library . They walked out of the dining room and through a kind of dark public parlor where sat three or four men hoping to secure a few moments of Pierpont Morgan 's time . These were his lawyers . They were there to advise him on his forthcoming appearance before the House Committee on Banking and Finance then sitting in Washington for the purpose of inquiring into the possibility that a money trust existed in the United States . Morgan waved the lawyers away as they rose upon sight of him . There was also in attendance an art dealer in a morning coat who had traveled from Rome expressly to see him . The dealer rose only to bow . None of this display was lost on Ford . He was a man of homespun tastes but was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different only in style from his own . Morgan brought him to the great West Room of the Library . Here they took chairs on opposite sides of a fireplace that was as tall as a man . It was a good day for a fire , Morgan said . Ford agreed . Cigars were offered . Ford refused . He noticed the ceiling was gilded . The walls were covered in red silk damask . There were fancy paintings hanging behind glass in heavy frame  --  icturesof yellowish soulful-looking people with golden haloes . He guessed nobody had their pictures made in those days who was n't a saint . There was a madonna and child . He ran his fingers along the arm of his chair of red plush . Morgan let him take it all in . He puffed on his cigar . Finally he spoke . Ford , he said gruffly , I have no interest in acquiring your business or in sharing its profits . Nor am I associated with any of your competitors . Ford nodded . I have to allow that is good news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nevertheless , hisE . L. Doctorow host continued , I admire what you have done , and while I must have qualms about a motorcar in the hands of every mongoloid who happens to have a few hundred dollars to spend , I recog- nize that the future is yours . You 're still a young ma  --  ifty years or thereabouts ? ? and perhaps you understand as I can- not the need to separately mobilize the masses of men . I have spent my life in the coordination of capital resources and the harmonic combination of industries , but I have never consid- ered the possibility that the employment of labor is in itself a harmonically unifying process apart from the enterprise in which it is enlisted . Let me ask you a question . Has it occurred to you that your assembly line is not merely a stroke of indus- trial genius but a projection of organic truth ? After all , the interchangeability of parts is a rule of nature . Individuals par- ticipate in their species and in their genus . All mammals re- produce in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nourishment , with digestive and circulatory systems that are recognizably the same , and they enjoy the same senses . Obvi- ously this is not to say all mammals have interchangeable parts , as your automobiles . But shared design is what allows taxono- mists to classify mammals as mammals . And within a species - man , for exampl  --  he rules of nature operate so that our individual differences occur on the basis of our similarity . So that individuation may be compared to a pyramid in that it is only achieved by the placement of the top stone . Ford pondered this . Exceptin the Jews , he muttered . Mor- gan did n't think he had heard correctly . I beg your pardon , he said . The Jews , Ford said . They ai n't like anyone else I know . There goes your theory up shits creek . He smiled . Morgan was silent for some minutes . He smoked his cigar . The fire crackled . Gusts of snow blown by the wind gently spattered the Library windows . Morgan spoke again . From time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and scientists to assist me in my philosophical investigations in hopes of reach- 11221 ing some conclusions about this life that are not within the reach of the masses of men . I am proposing to share the fruits of my study . I do not think you can be so insolent as to believe your achievements are the result only of your own effort . Did you attribute your success in this manner , I would warn you , sir , of the terrible price to be paid . You would find yourself stranded on the edge of the world and see as no other man the emptiness of the firmament . Do you believe in God ? That 's my business , Ford said . Well and good , Morgan said , I would not expect any man of your intelligence to embrace such a commonidea . You may need me more than you think . Suppose I could prove to you that there are universal patterns of order and repetition that give meaning to the activity of this planet . Suppose I could demonstrate that you yourself are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that affirm the oldest wisdom in the world . Abruptly Morgan stood and left the room . Ford turned in his chair and looked after him . In a moment the old man was in the doorway and beckoning to him with a vehement gesture . Ford followed him through the central hall of the Library to the East Room , whose high walls were covered with bookshelves . There were two upper tiers with promenades of frosted glass and polished brass balustrades so that any book could be easily removed from its place no matter how high . Morgan walked up to the far wall , pressed the spine of a certain book , and part of the shelving swung away to reveal a passageway through which a man could pass . If you please , he said to Ford , and following him into a small chamber he pressed a button that closed the door behind them . This was an ordinary-sized room modestly appointed with a round polished table , two spindle-back chairs , and a cabinet with a glass top for the display of manuscripts . Morgan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nobody has ever joined me in this room before , he said . He turned on aE . L. Doctorowfloor lamp arranged to light the display cabinet . Come over here , sir , he said . Ford looked through the glass and saw an ancient parchment covered with Latin calligraphy . That , Morgansaid , is a folio of one of the first Rosicrucian texts , The Chemical Wedding of Christian Rosencrutz . Do you know who the original Rosicrucians were , Mr. Ford ? They were Christian alchemists of the Rhenish palatinate whose elector was Frederick V. We are talking about the early seventeenth century , sir . These great and good men promulgated the idea of an ongoing , beneficent magic available to certain men of every age for the collective use of mankind . The Latin for this is prisca theologia , secret wisdom . The odd thing is that this belief in a secret wisdom is not the Rosicrucians ' alone . We know in London in the middle of the same century of the existence of a society called the Invisible College . Its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beneficent magic I speak of . You of course do not know of the writings of Giordano Bruno , of which here is a specimen page in his own handwriting . My scholars have traced for me , like the best detectives , the existence of this idea and of various mysterious organizations to maintain it , in most of the Renaissance cultures , in medieval societies and in ancient Greece . I hope you are following this closely . The earliest recorded mention of special people born in each age to ease the sufferings of humankindwith their prisca theologia comes to us through the Greek in the translated writings of the Egyptian priest Hermes Trismegistus . It is Hermes who gives the historical name to this occult knowledge . It is called the Hermetica . With his thick index finger Morgan thumped the glass above the last display piece in the cabinet , a fragment of pink stone upon which geometric scratchings were faintly visible . That , sir , may be a specimen of Hermes in the original cuneiform . And now let me ask you a question . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every age and civilization of mankind disappears1241RAGTIMEin modern times ? Because only in the age of science have these men and their wisdom dropped from view . I 'll tell you why : The rise of mechanistic science , of Newton and Descartes , was a great conspiracy , a great devilish conspiracy to destroy our apprehension of reality and our awareness of the transcendentallygifted among us . But they are with us today nevertheless . They are with us in every age . They come back , you see ? They come back ! Morgan was now florid with excitement . He directed Ford 's attention to the furthermost corner of the room where in the shadow stood yet another furnishing , something rectangular that was covered with a gold velvet cloth . Morgan gripped the corner of the cloth in his fist , and staring with fierce proprietary triumph at his guest he pulled it away and dropped it to the floor . Ford inspected the item . It was a glass case sealed with lead . Within the case was a sarcophagus . He heard the old man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the room . The sarcophagus was of alabaster . Topping it was a wooden effigy of the fellow who lay within . The effigy was painted in gold leaf , red ochre and blue . This , sir , said Morgan in a hoarse voice , is the coffin of a great Pharaoh . The Egyptian governmentand the entire archaeological community believe it residesin Cairo . Were my possession of it known , there would be an international uproar . It is literally beyond value . My private staff of Egyptologists has taken every scientific precautionto preserve it from the ravages of the air . Under the mask that you see is the mummy of the great Pharaoh of the NineteenthDynasty , Seti the First , recovered from the Temple of Karnak where it lay for over three thousand years . I will show it to you in due course . Let me now say only that I guarantee the visage of the great king will be of considerable interest to you . Morgan had to recover his composure . He pulled back one of the chairs and sat down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to normal . Ford had sat down across from him , and understanding the old man 's physical difficulties , remained quiet and stared at his own shoes . The shoes , brown lace-ups , he had bought from the catalogue of L. L. Bean . They were good comfortable shoes . Mr. Ford , Pierpont Morgan said , I want you to be my guest on an expedition to Egypt . That is very much the place , sir . That is where it all begins . I have commissioned a steamer designed expressly for sailing the Nile . When she 's ready I want you to come with me . Will you do that ? It will require no investment on your part . We must go to Luxor and Karnak . We must go to the Great Pyramid at Giza . There are so few of us , sir . My money has brought me to the door of certain crypts , the deciphering of sacred hieroglyphs . Why should we not satisfy ourselves of the truth of who we are and the eternal beneficent force which we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay over the wooden arms of his chair as if broken at the wrists . He consideredeverything that had been said . He looked at the sarcophagus . When he had satisfied himself that he understood , he nodded his head solemnly and replied as follows : If I understand you right , Mr. Morgan , you are talking about reincarnation . Well , let me tell you about that . As a youth I was faced with an awful crisis in my mental life when it came over me that I had no call to know what I knew . I had grit , all right , but I was an ordinary country boy who had suffered his McGuffey like the rest of them . Yet I knew how everything worked . I could look at something and tell you how it worked and probably show you how to make it work better . But I was no intellectual , you see , and I had no patience with the twodollarwords . Morgan listened . He felt that he must n't move . Well then , Ford continued , I happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An Eastern Fakir 's Eternal Wisdom , publishedby the Franklin Novelty Company of Philadelphia , ( 1261RAGTIMEPennsylvania . And in this book , which cost me just twenty-five cents , I found everything I needed to set my mind at rest . Reincarnation is the only belief I hold , Mr. Morgan . I explain my genius this wa  --  ome of us have just lived more times than others . So you see , what you have spent on scholars and traveled around the world to find , I already knew . And I 'll tell you something , in thanks for the eats , I 'm going to lend that book to you . Why , you do n't have to fuss with all these Latiny things , he said waving his arm , you do n't have to pick the garbage pails of Europe and build steamboats to sail the Nile just to find out something that you can get in the mail order for two bits ! The two men stared at each other . Morgan sat back in his chair . The blood drained from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he spoke , it was with the weak voice of an old man . Mr. Ford , he said , if my ideas can survive their attachment to you , they will have met their ultimate test . Nevertheless the crucial breakthrough had been made . About a year after this extraordinary meeting Morgan made his trip to Egypt . Although Ford did not go with him he had conceded the possibility of an awesome lineage . And together they had managed to found the most secret and exclusive club in America , The Pyramid , of which they were the only members . It endowed certain researches which persist to this day. ( 127 ( RAGTIMEOf course at this time in our history the images of ancient Egypt were stamped on everyone 's mind . This was due to the discoveries being reported out of the desert by British and American archaeologists . After the football players in their padded canvas knee pants and leather helmets , archaeologists were the glamour personages of the universities .

Out went the Louis Quatorze and in came the throne chairs with the carved serpent arms . In New Rochelle , Mother was not immune to the fashion , and finding the floral print in the dining room oppressively dull she replaced it with an elegant pattern of sloe-eyed Egyptian males and females in headdresses and short skirts . Colored red ochre , blue and tan , they paraded along the walls in that peculiar frontal way of Egyptians , with vultures on their palms , sheaves of wheat , water lilies and lutes . They were accompanied by lion , scarabs , owl , oxen and dismembered feet . Father , sensitive to every change , found his appetite diminished . It seemed to him inap- propriate to entomb oneself in order to dine . 11281 The boy , however , loved the design and was inspired to study the hieroglyphic alphabet . He abandoned Wild West Weekly for magazines that published tales of violated tombs and the coming to fruition of mummies ' curses . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in his quiet secret games incorporated her as a Nubian princess now captured for a slave . Unaware , she sat in her room by the window , while he passed her door in a beaked papier-mache mask of an ibis which he had made himself . One afternoon , a Sunday , a new Model T Ford slowly came up the hill and went past the house . The boy , who happened to see it from the porch , ran down the steps and stood on the sidewalk . The driver was looking right and left as if trying to find a particular address ; he turned the car around at the corner and came back . Pulling up before the boy , he idled his throttle and beckoned with a gloved hand . He was a Negro . His car shone . The brightwork gleamed . There was a glass windshield and a custom pantasote top . I 'm looking for a young woman of color whose name is Sarah , he said . She is said to reside in one of these houses . The boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's here . The man switched off the motor , set the brake and jumped down . Then he climbed the stone steps under the two Norwegian maples and walked around the side of the house to the back door . When Mother came to the door the colored man was respectful , but there was something disturbingly resolute and self-important in the way he asked her if he could please speak with Sarah . Mother could not judge his age . He was a stocky man with a red-complected shining brown face , high cheekbonesand large dark eyes so intense as to suggest they were about to cross . He had a neat moustache . He was dressed in the affectation of wealth to which colored people lent themselves. lle wore a fitted black overcoat , a black and whitehound's-tooth suit , gray spats and pointed black shoes . He held in his hand a charcoal-gray cap and driving goggles . She told him to wait and closed the door . She climbed to the third floor . She found the girl Sarah not sitting at the window as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her , and facing the door . Sarah , Mother said , you have a caller . The girl said nothing . Will you come to the kitchen ? The girl shook her head . You do n't want to see him ? No , ma'am , the girl finally said softly while she looked at the floor . Send him away , please . This was the most she had said in all the months she had lived in the house . Mother went back downstairs and found the fellow not at the hack door but in the kitchen where , in the warmth of the corner near the cookstove , Sarah 's baby lay sleeping in his carriage . It was a wicker carriage on four wooden tapered spoke wheels and it had a faded upholstery of blue satin with a plush roll . Her own son had slept in it and her brother before him . The black man was kneeling beside the carriage and staring at the child . Mother , not thinking clearly , was suddenly outraged that he had presumed to come in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , and she held the door open . The colored man took another glance at the child , rose , thanked her and departed . She slammed the door harder than she should have . The baby woke and began to cry . She picked him up , comforting him , astonished by her extreme reaction to the visitor . Such was the coming of the colored man in the car to Broadview Avenue . His name was Coalhouse Walker Jr . Be- ginning with that Sunday he appeared every week , always knocking at the back door , always turning away without corn- plaint upon Sarah 's refusal to see him . Father considered the visits a nuisance and wanted to discourage them . I 'll call the police , he said . Mother laid her hand on his arm . One Sunday the colored man left a bouquet of yellow chrysanthemums which in this season had to have cost him a pretty penny . ( 1301 Before she took the flowers up to Sarah , Mother stood at the parlor window . Out on the street the black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the headlamps and the windshield . He glanced up at the third-floor window and drove away . Mother now had cause to remember the expression on the faces of the Ohio seminarians who called on her when she was a girl of seventeen . She said to Father I think what we are witnessing is , in fact , a courtship of the most stubborn Christiankind . Father replied Yes , if you can call a courtship what has already produced a child . I find that an unkind remark , Mother said . There was suffering , and now there is penitence . It 's very grand and I 'm sorry for you that you do n't see it . The black girl would say nothing about her visitor . They had no idea where she had met him , or how . As far as they knew she had no family nor any friends from the black community in the downtown section of the city . There was a settled society of Negroes there but also , on its margins , a transient element . Apparently she was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work as a servant . Mother was exhilarated by the situation . For the first time since the terrible day she had found the brown baby in the flower bed she saw a reason for hope for the young woman 's future . She began to regret Sarah 's intransigence . She thought of the drive from Harlem , where Coalhouse Walker Jr . lived , and the drive back , and she decidedthe next time to give him more of a visit . She would serve tea in the parlor . Father questioned the propriety of this . Mother said He is well-spoken and conducts himself as a gentleman . I see nothing wrong with it . When Mr. Roosevelt was in the White House he gave dinner to Booker T. Washington . Surely we can serve tea to Coalhouse Walker Jr . And so it happened on the next Sunday that the Negro took tea . Father noted that he suffered no embarrassment by being in the parlor with a cup and saucer in his hand . On the contrary , he acted as if it was the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The surroundings did not awe him nor was his manner deferential . He was courteous and correct . He told them about ' himself . He was a professional pianist and was now more or less permanently located in New York , having secured a job with the Jim Europe Clef Club Orchestra , a well-known ensemble that gave regular concerts at the Manhattan Casino on 155th Street and Eighth Avenue . It was important , he said , for a musician to find a place that was permanent , a job that requiredno traveling . I am through traveling , he said . I am through going on the road . He spoke so fervently that Father realized the message was intended for the woman upstairs . This irritated him . What can you play ? he said abruptly . Why do n't you play something for us . The black man placed his tea on the tray : He rose , patted his lips with the napkin , placed the napkin beside his cup and went to the piano . He sat on the piano stool and immediately rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He sat down again , played a chord and turned to them . This piano is badly in need of a tuning , he said . Father 's face reddened . Oh yes , Mother said , we are terrible about that . The musician turned again to the keyboard . " Wall Street Rag , " he said . Composed by the great Scott Joplin . He began to play . Illtunedor not the Aeolian had never made such sounds . Small clear chords hung in the air like flowers . The melodies were like bouquets . There seemed to be no other possibilities for life than those delineated by the music . When the piece was over Coalhouse Walker turned on the stool and found in his audiencethe entire family , Mother , Father , the boy , Grandfather and Mother 's Younger Brother , who had come down from his room in shirt and suspenders to see who was playing . Of all of them he was the only one who knew ragtime . He had heard it in his nightlife period in New York . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home . Coalhouse Walker Jr . turned back to the piano and said " The Maple Leaf . " Composed by the great Scott Joplin . The most famous rag of all rang through the air . The pianist sat stiffly at the keyboard , his long dark hands with their pink nails seemingly with no effort producing the clusters of syncopating chords and the thumping octaves . This was a most robust composition , a vigorous music that roused the senses and never stood still a moment . The boy perceived it as light touching various places in space , accumulating in intricate patterns until the entire room was made to glow with its own being . The music filled the stairwell to the third floor where the mute and unforgiving Sarah sat with her hands folded and listened with the door open . The piece was brought to a conclusion . Everyone applauded . Mother then introduced Mr. Walker to Grandfather and to Younger Brother , who shook the black man 's hand and said I am pleased to meet you . Coalhouse Walker was solemn . Everyonewas standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Father was not knowledgeable in music . His taste ran to Carrie Jacobs Bond . He thought Negro music had to have smiling and cakewalking . Do you know any coon songs ? he said . He did not intend to be rud  --  oon songs was what they were called . But the pianist responded with a tense shake of the head . Coon songs are made for minstrel shows , he said . White men sing them in blackface . There was another silence . The black man looked at the ceiling . Well , he said , it appears as if Miss Sarah will not be able to receive me . He turned abruptly and walked through the hall to the kitchen . The family followed him . He had left his coat on a chair . He put it on and ignoring them all , he knelt and gazed at the baby asleep in its carriage . After several moments he stood up , said good day and walked out the door . The visit impressed everyone except Sarah , who gave no sign of relenting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man . The next week he returned , and the week after that . Ile was132 11331E . L. Doctorow I RAGTIMEnow visiting the family and each time brought them up on the news of his doings of the previous six days , never once assuminganything but their total and consuming interest . Father was put off by the man 's airs . She wo n't see him , he told Mother . Am I to go on entertaining Coalhouse Walker every Sunday for the rest of my life ? But Mother saw signs of progress . Sarah had taken on the duties of the departed housekeeper and now cleaned rooms so energetically and with such proprietary competence that Mother laughed with the momentary illusion that it was Sarah 's own house she was cleaning . She also began to claim her child at other than feeding time , first taking over his daily bath , then carrying him upstairs to her room at night . Still she would not see her visitor . Coalhouse Walker appeared faithfully through the winter . More than once , when the roads were made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caught the North Avenue streetcar to the bottom of the hill . He wore with his fitted black overcoat a lamb's-wool hat in the Russian style . He brought outfits for the child . He brought a silver-handled hairbrushfor Sarah . Father had to admire his perseverance . He wondered to what extent a musician 's wages could sustain such gifts . It occurred to Father one day that Coalhouse Walker Jr . did n't know he was a Negro . The more he thought about this the more true it seemed . Walker did n't act or talk like a colored man . He seemed to be able to transform the customary deferences practiced by his race so that they reflected to his own dignity rather than the recipient 's . When he arrived at the back door he gave it a stout rap and when admitted would solemnly greet everyone and somehow convey to them the feeling that they were Sarah 's family , and that his courtesies to them simply measured the regard and respect he held for her . Father recognized certain dangers in the man . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Mother . There is somethingreckless , about him . Even Mathew Henson knew his place . By this time , however , the course of events could not be changed . In the late winter Sarah said she would see Coalhouse Walker in the parlor . For days there was a flurry of preparation . Mother gave her one of her own dresses and helped her to take it in . She came downstairs , beautiful and shy . Her hair was combed and pomaded and she sat on the sofa with her eyes lowered as Coalhouse Walker Jr . spoke his formal conversation and played the piano for her . It was only when they were seen together that it became apparent he was a good deal older than she was . Mother insisted that the members of the family excusethemselves so that the courtship could go on in privacy . Nothing was speeded by this . After the visit Sarah looked irritated and even angry . She was slow to forgive , and in some peculiar way her stubbornness seemed the only appropriate response to his persistence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not something either of these people took carelessly . They lived in brutal subjection to their hopes and feelings . They suffered themselves . Mother 's Younger Brother understood this perhaps more clearly than anyone in the family . He had spoken to Coalhouse Walker just once but admired him immensely . He saw in the way the black man acted upon his intentions more manhood than he himself possessed . He brooded over this . Younger Brother understood the love in some hearts as a physical tenderness in that part of the body , a flaw in the physiological being equivalent to rickets of the bones or a disposition of the lungs to congest . He was afflicted with this and so was Sarah , colored though she was . I le thought she was some displaced African queen ; her very awkwardness as she moved suggested that it would be grace in another country . And the more reluctant she seemed to accept Coalhouse Walker 's offer of marriage , the more Younger Brother understood what a terribly afflicted heart she had. 1341 11351E . L. DoctorowBut one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small brown buds visible on the branches of the maple trees , Coalhouse arrived in his shining Ford and left the motor idling . Neighbors in their yards came out to watch the strange intense black man , burly and correct , with his dark , dark eyes on the verge of crossing , and the beautifully awkward Sarah , wearing a pink shirtwaist and a black skirt and jacket and one of Mother 's wide-brimmed hats , as they walked under the Norwegian maples and down the concrete steps to the street . She carried her baby . He helped her into the car and got up behind the wheel . They waved to the family and drove off through the suburban streets to the farmlands at the north end of town . They parked at the side of the road . They watched a cardinal skim the hard brown earth , then beat its way to the highest thinnest branch of a tree . This was the day he asked her to marry and she accepted . The appearance of these magnificentlovers in the family 's life had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hypnotic effect. 22And now Mother 's Younger Brother began again his trips to New York . He would work at his drawing table past the dinner hour and then catch an evening train . He had made friends of some ordnance officers on duty at the armory on Lexington Avenue and 34th Street . They complained about the Springfieldrifle . They showed him their small arms and their grenade bombs . He knew immediately that he could design better weapons . He drank with the officers . He became known at the stage doors of several Broadway theatres . He stood in the alleys , like others , never so well-groomed as some of the older men , nor so carelessly handsome as the collegians from Princetonor Yale . But there was an intensity of expectation about his eyes that attracted a fair number of women . He was always so serious and unhappy that they were persuaded he loved them . They took him for a poet . Still , his salary could n't support these tastes . Broadway was alive with lights and entertainments and everyone connected with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He learned where to find women who would go to bed with him for a modest price . One of these places was the Bethesda Fountain in Central Park . They walked in twos11361 11371 E. L. Doctorow I RAGTIMEwhenever the weather was mild . The days were beginning to lengthen . In cold luxurious sunsets they strolled about the fountain , shadows filling the great steps , the water already black , the paving stones brown and pink . He amused them by taking them seriously . He was gentle with them and they did n't mind his oddity because it was gentle . He would take a woman to his hotel room and then sit in a chair with one shoe in his hand and completely forget about her . Or he would not attempt to make love but only inspect her intimate places . He drank wine until he was insensible . He dined in steakhouses with sawdust on the floor . He went to cellar clubs in Hell 's Kitchen where hoodlums bought everyone drinks . He walked Manhattan at night , his eyes devouring passers-by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in hotel lobbies , his restless eyes picking out motion and color before it defined itself . Eventually he found the offices of the Mother Earth magazinepublished by Emma Goldman . They were on 13th Street in a brownstone that served now as the anarchist 's residence when she was in New York . He stood in the street under the lamppost and stared at the windows . He did this for several nights . Finally a man came out of the door , walked down the steps and crossed the street to where he stood . He was a tall cadaverous man , with long hair and a string tie . He said It gets cold in the evening  --  ome in , we have no secrets . And Younger Brother was led across the street and up the steps . It turned out that in his vigil he had been mistaken for a police spy . He was treated with elaborate irony . He was offered tea . Numbers of people were standing about in the apartment in their hats and coats . Then Goldman appeared in a doorway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she said . That 's no policeman . She began to laugh . She was putting on a hat and setting it in place with hatpins . He was thrilled that she remembered him . Come with us , she called. 11381A while later Younger Brother found himself in the Cooper Union down near the Bowery . The hall was hot , crowded to overflowing . There were lots of foreigners . Men wore their derbies though indoors . It was a great stinking congress garlickedand perfumed in its own perspiration . It had met in support of the Mexican Revolution . He had n't known there was a Mexican Revolution . Men waved their fists . They stood on benches . Speaker after speaker arose . Some spoke in languagesother than English . They were not translated . He had trouble hearing . What seemed to have happened was that the Mexican peons had spontaneously revolted against Diaz the President of Mexico for the past thirty-five years . They needed guns . They needed ammunition . They were striking from the hills , attacking the Federals and the supply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about this . Finally Emma Goldman got up to speak . Of all the orators she was the best . The hall went quiet as she described the complicityof the wealthy landowners and the despised tyrant Diaz , the subjugation of the peons , the poverty and starvation and , most shameful of all , the presence of representatives of Americanbusiness firms in the national counsels of the Mexican government . Her voice was strong . As she moved her head and gesticulated the light flashed from her glasses . He pushed his way forward to be closer to her . She described one Emiliano Zapata , a simple farmer of the Morelos district who had turned revolutionary because he had no choice . He wore the share farmer 's bleached pajama coat and trousers , bound over the chest with bandoleers and belted with a cartridge belt . My comrades , she cried , that is not a foreign costume . There are no foreign lands . There is no Mexican peasant , there is no dictator Diaz . There is only one struggle throughout the world , there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darkness of life on earth . The applause was deafening . Younger Brother had no money . Ile turned out his pockets , mortified1139IRAGTIMEE . L. Doctorowto see all around him people who reeked of their poverty coming up with handfuls of change . He found himself standingat the foot of the speaker 's platform . The speeches were done , she stood surrounded by colleagues and admirers . He saw her hug a swarthy man who wore a dark suit and tie but also an enormous sombrero . She turned and her glance fell on the balding blondish young man whose head came just above the platform stage , as if severed like a French republican 's , the eyes turned upward in a kind of ecstasy . She laughed . He thought at the end of the rally that she would speak to him but there was a reception for the Mexican back at the offices of Mother Earth . He was the zapatista representative . He wore boots under his cufliess trousers . He did not smile but drank tea and then wiped his long moustaches with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ journalists , bohemians , artists , poets and society women . Younger Brother was not aware that he was following Goldman about . He was desperate for her attention . But she was enormously busy with everyone else . Each new person who came in the door had to be seen . She had lots on her mind . She introduced people to each other . To different persons she proposed different things they must do , others they should speak with , places they ought to go , situations they ought to look into or write about . He felt incredibly ignorant . She went into the kitchen and whipped up the batter for a cake . Here , she said to Younger Brother , take these cups and put them on the table in the big room . He was grateful to be taken into her network of useful people . There were posters of Mother Earth magazine covers on every wall . A tall long-haired man was dispensing the punch . He was the one who had come out to the street to invite Younger Brother upstairs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His fingernails were outlined in black . He was drinking as much as he dispensed . He greeted people by singing a line1401or two from a song . Everyone laughed who spoke to him . His name was Ben Reitman , he was the man Goldman lived with . There was something the matter with the top of his head , there was a shaven patch . Noticing Younger Brother 's glance he explained that he had been in San Diego and had been tarred and feathered . Emma had gone there to speak . He acted as her manager , renting the halls , making the arrangements . They had not wanted Emma to speak . They had kidnapped him , driven him somewhere , stripped him and tarred him . They had burned him with their cigars , and worse . As he gave this account his face darkened , his smile disappeared . An audiencehad gathered . He was holding the punch ladle and it began to click against the side of the bowl . He could n't seem to let go of it . He gazed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They did not want my momma to speak in Kansas City or Los Angeles or Spokane , he said . But she spoke . We know every jail . We win every case . My momma will speak in San Diego . He laughed as if he could n't believe his own hand shook as it did . The ladle clicked against the bowl . At this point a man pushed his way to the table and said You think , Reitman , the world is well-served by your being tarred and feathered ? He was a short , totally baldheaded man with thick eyeglasses , a large full mouth and a very sallow complexionwith skin like wax . The issue has become Emma 's right to speak rather than what she has to say . All our energies go into defending ourselves . That is their strategy , not our own . I 'm afraid you do n't understand that . What is so glorious , poor Reitman , about being bailed out of the tank by some guilty liberal . So that then he can congratulate himself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at each other . Goldman 's voice called cheerfully from the back of the gathering : Sacha ! She came around the table wiping her hands on her apron . She stood next to Reitman . She gently removed the ladle from his11411E . L. Doctorowhand . Sacha , my dear , she said to the sallow man , if first we have to teach them their own ideals , perhaps then we may teach them ours . The party went on into the early hours . Younger Brother despaired of getting her attention . He sat , Indian style , on an old couch with sagging springs . After some time he realized the room was quiet . He looked up . Goldman was sitting on a kitchen chair directly in front of him . The room was otherwise empty , he was the last guest . Unaccountably , tears came to his eyes . You actually asked if I remembered you , Emma Goldman said . But how could I forget . Could anyone forget a sight such as that , my pagan . She touched his cheek with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so tragic . She sighed . Is that all you want from your life ? Her large magnified eyes peered at him through the lenses of her eyeglasses . She sat with her legs apart , her hands on her knees . I do n't know where she is . But if I could tell you , what good would that do ? Suppose you got her to come back to you ? She would only stay awhile . She would run away from you again , do n't you know that ? He nodded . You look terrible , Goldman said . What have you been doing to yourself ? Do n't you eat ? Do n't you get any fresh air ? He shook his head . You have aged ten years . I can not sympa- thize . You think you are special , losing your lover . It happens , every day . Suppose she consented to live with you after all . You 're a bourgeois , you would want to marry her . You would destroy each other inside of a year . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your very eyes . You would sit across the dinner table from each other in bondage , in terrible bondage to what you thought was love . The both of you . Believe me you are better off this way . Younger Brother was crying . You 're right , he said , of course you 're right . He kissed her hand . She had a small hand but the fingers were swollen 142 and the skin was red and the knuckles were enlarged . I have no memories of her , he sobbed . It was something I dreamed . Goldman was unappeased . This way you can feel sorry for yourself , she said . And what a delicious emotion that is . I 'll tell you something . In this room tonight you saw my present lover but also two of my former lovers . We are all good friends . Friendship is what endures .

He stared at the floor . He felt her fingers under his chin . His head was lifted , tilted up . He found himself staring into the faces of Goldmanand Reitman . From Reitman 's scatterbrained smile a gold tooth gleamed . They peered at him , curious and interested . Goldman said He reminds me of Czolgosz . Reitman said He is educated , a bourgeois . But the same poor boy in the eyes , Goldman said . The same poor dangerous boy . Younger Brother saw himself standing in line to shake the hand of William McKinley . A handkerchief was wrapped around his hand . In the handkerchief was a gun . McKinley fell back . Blood dyed his vest . There were screams . When he left she hugged him at the door . Her lips , surprisinglysoft , pressed his cheek . He was overcome . He stepped back . The literature under his arm fell to the floor . There was laughter between them as they crouched in the doorway and gathered it up . But an hour later he stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Rochelle . He considered throwing himself tinder the wheels . He listened to their rhythm , their steady clacking , like the left hand of a rag . The screeching and poundingof metal on metal where the two cars joined was the1143E . L. Doctorowsyncopating right hand . It was a suicide rag . He held the door handles on either side of him listening to the music . The cars jumped under his feet . The moon raced with the train . He held his face up to the sky between the cars , as if even moonlight could warm him. 23One Sunday afternoon the colored man Coalhouse Walker said goodbye to his fiancee and drove off to New York in his Ford . It was about five o'clock in the evening and shadows of the trees darkened the road . His route took him along FirehouseLane , past the station house of the Emerald Isle Engine , a company of volunteer firemen known for the dash of their parade uniforms and the liveliness of their outings . In the many times he had gone this way the Emerald @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a twostoryclapboard building , and as he drove past they would fall silent and stare at him . He was not unaware that in his dress and as the owner of a car he was a provocation to many white people . He had created himself in the teeth of such feelings . At this time private volunteer companies were maintained as auxiliaries to the municipal fire department ; and these companies , which relied upon private subscription , had yet to motorizetheir equipment . As the Negro came along a team of three matching gray engine horses cantered out of the firehouseinto the road pulling behind them the big steam pumper for which the Emerald Isle was locally renowned . They were14511441E . L. Doctorowimmediately reined , causing Coalhouse Walker to brake his car abruptly . Two of the volunteers came out of the building to join the driver of the pumper who sat up on his box looking at the Negro and yawning ostentatiously . They all wore blue work shirts with green handkerchief ties , dark blue trousers and boots . Coalhouse Walker released the clutch pedal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waited until this was done and then advised him that he was traveling on a private toll road and that he could not drive on without pay- ment of twenty-five dollars or by presenting a pass indicating that he was a resident of the city . This is a public thoroughfare , Walker said , I 've traveled it dozens of times and no one has ever said anything about a toll . He got up behind the wheel . Tell the Chief , one of the men said to another . Walker decided to put the Ford into reverse gear , back up to the corner and go another way . He turned in his seat . At this moment two of the firemen carrying a twenty-foot ladder between them came into the street behind the car . Two others followed with an- other ladder and others came out with carts of coiled hose , buckets , axes , hooks and other fire-fighting equipment , all of which was deposited in the street , the company having chosen this particular moment to sweep out its quarters . The Chief of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wore at a cocky angle . He was also somewhat older than the rest . He was courteous to Coalhouse and ex- plained that while the toll had never before been collected from him it was nevertheless in force , and that if Coalhouse did not pay up he would not pass . With his two hands he lifted his hat from his head and reset it so that the visor covered his eyes . This caused him to tilt his chin upwards in order to see , giving him a pugnacious look . He was a heavyset man with thick arms . Many of the volunteers were grinning . We need 146 the money for a firetruck , the Chief explained . So we can drive to fires just like you drive to whorehouses . The Negro calmly considered the courses of action available to him . The Emerald Isle firehouse looked across the street to an open field that sloped down to a pond . Conceivably he might drive off the road , turn in the field and circumnavigate the ladders and hose cart . But he was wedged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wheel hard enough to clear the horses the severe angle of the turn might tilt the car over on the downhill slope . Apparently it did not occur to him to ingratiate himself in the fashion of his race . Playing down at the edge of the pond were a couple of Negro boys , ten or twelve years old . Hey , Coalhouse Walker called to them . Come on up here ! The boys came running . They stared at Coalhouse as he switched off the engine , set the brake and stepped down to the road . I want you to watch this car , he told them . When I come back you tell me if anyone touched it . The musician quickly strode back to the corner and headed toward the business district . After ten minutes he found a policeman operating a stop-and-go traffic signal . The policemanlistened to his complaint and shook his head and spent some time removing his handkerchief from under his frock coat and blowing his nose . Those boys do n't mean no harm , he finally said . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're probably tired of the sport . Walker may have realized this was probably the maximum support he could expect from a policeman . At the same time he may have wondered if he 'd been oversensitive to what was intended as no more than a prank . So he went back to Firehouse Lane . The fire engine and horses were withdrawn . The road was empty of volunteers and his car stood off the road in the field . Ile made his way to the car . It was spattered with mud . There147E . L. Doctorow was a six-inch tear in the custom pantasote top . And deposited in the back seat was a mound of fresh human excrement . He went across the street to the firehouse door . Standing there with his arms folded was the Chief in his white military cap and green bohemian tie . The Police Department advises me there is no toll road anywhere in this city , Coalhouse Walker said . That 's right , said the Chief . Anyone is free to come and go on this road anytime he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the electric lights were on inside the firehouse . Through the glass panels in the door the Negro could see the three matching grays in their stalls , the great nickel-plated pumper with its brass fittings backed up to the rear wall . I want my car cleaned and the damage paid for , he said . The Chief began to laugh and a couple of his men came out to join the fun . At this moment a police van drove up . It carried two officers , one of them the traffic policeman to whom Coalhouse Walker had appealed . He went into the field , looked at the car and came back to the firehouse . Willie , the policeman said to the Fire Chief , did you or your boys do any desecratin ? I 'll tell you exactly what happened , the Chief said . The nigger here parked his damn car in the middle of the road right in front of the firehouse . We had to move it . It 's a serious business blocking a fire station , ai n't that so , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policeman came to a decision . He took Coal- house aside . Listen , he said , we 'll push your tin lizzie back on the road and you be on your way . There 's no real damage . Scrape off the shit and forget the whole thing . I was on my way when they stopped me , Coalhouse said . They put filth in my car and tore a hole in the top . I want the car cleaned and the damage paid for . The officer had now begun to appreciate Coalhouse 's style of speech , his dress , and the phenomenon of his owning a car in the first place . He grew angry . If you do n't take your automobile and get along out of here , he said loudly , 11481 I 'm going to charge you with driving off the road , drunkenness , and making an unsightly nuisance . I do not drink , Coalhouse said . I did not drive my car off the road nor slash the roof nor defecate in it . I want the damage paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Chief , who was grinning at his discomfiture , so that the issue for him was now his own authority . He said to Coalhouse I 'm placing you under arrest . You 'll come with me in the wagon . Early that evening the telephone rang at Broadview Avenue . The caller was Coalhouse and after quickly explaining that he was at Police Headquarters and why , he asked Father if he would consider putting up bail so that he could get to the city and not miss work that evening . It is to Father 's credit that he responded at once , holding back his questions until there was the leisure to have them answered . He called for a cab and went down to the station house and there wrote a cheque for the amount , which was fifty dollars . But as he reported the incident to Mother he was put off because Coalhouse Walker was barely civil in his gratitude and rushed off to the train station saying only he 'd make good the sum . The next evening the household experienced the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a Sunday . He sat in the parlor with his arms folded and told the story in detail . There was no aggrieved tone in his voice , he recited calmly and objectively , as if he were describing something that had happened to someone else . Mother said Mr. Walker , I am ashamed that this community is represented in your mind by that bunch of toughs . Father said The company has a bad reputation . They are an exception , the other volunteer engines being in all ways upright and responsible . Younger Brother sat on the piano stool with his legs crossed . He leaned forward , totally engaged by the problem . Where is the car now ? he said . And what about those two boys ? They are witnesses for you . Rut the pianist had spent the afternoon tracking down theE . L. Doctorowboys only to find their parents refusing to have them involved in the matter . I 'm a stranger to the Negroes here , he said matter-of-factly . They have to live here and they want no trouble . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And I wo n't until it is returned to me as it was when I drove away from this house yesterday evening . Standing in the hallway just out of sight during this interviewwas Sarah . She held her baby on her hip and she listened . She perceived as no one in the family could the enormity of the misfortune . She heard Father say to Coalhouse that if he intended to pursue his claim he should engage a lawyer . There was such a thing as the power of subpoena for witnesses . Are there any colored lawyers here ? Coalhouse asked . I do n't know of one , Father said . But any lawyer who loves justice will do , I should think . He paused . I will underwrite the expense , he said in a gruff voice . Coalhouse stood . I thank you but that wo n't be necessary . He put an envelope on the side table . In it was fifty dollars in cash . This , Mother learned afterward , had come out of the money he was saving toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took it upon himself to go to the site of the incident and see the car . After work he rode his bicycle to Firehouse Lane . The Model T had been thoroughly vandalized , whether by the volunteers or others it was impossible to determine . It sat with its front end in the tall weeds at the edge of the pond . The wheels were sunk in the mud . The headlamps and the windshield were shattered . The rear tires were flattened , the tufted upholstery had been gutted and the custom pantasote top was slashed to ribbons. 24Younger Brother stood at the pond . Since his evening with Emma Goldman he had been in considerable difficulty . People at work were surprised by his animation . He fixed his attention on anything that could sustain it . He produced small talk that verged on hysteria . He sat at his drawing table and turned out designs in endless modifications for rifles and grenades . He measured the small squares and made his computations and watched the point of his pencil as it impressed the paper . When there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just to hear the sound . Thus with continuous concentration and the expenditure of enormous amounts of energy he tried to keep himself from slipping into the vast distances of his unhappiness . It was all around him . It was a darkness as impudently close as his brow . It choked him by its closeness . And what was most terrifying was its treachery . He would wake up in the morning and see the sun coming in the window , and sit up in his bed and think it was gone , and then find it there after all , behind his ears or in his heart . He decided he was on the verge of a nervous collapse . He prescribed for himself a regimen of cold baths and physical exertion . He bought a Columbia bicycle and rode it to work. 11501 11511 E. L. Doctorow RAGTIMEAt night , before bed , he would do calisthenics until he was exhausted . On the floor below , Mother and Father felt the house shake . They realized he was jumping up and down . They were used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shared his hopes or feelings and so they saw no marked change in his behavior . Mother did ask him to join them in the parlor after dinner when he had no plans for the evening . He tried this . He heard them address him , heard himself answer . He saw them in their suffocating parlor with its chaise and its mounted heads and fringed lampshades and he felt he could n't breathe . He despised them . He thought they were complacent , ordinary and inconsiderate . One evening Father read to everyone the editorial in the local newspaper . Father liked to read aloud when he found something particularly instructive or well-written . The title of the editorial was THE SPRING PEEPER . SO that diminutive visitor to our ponds and fields has come to call once again , Father read . In truth he is no less ugly than his older brothers Frog and Toad . But we welcome the gallant little fellow and laud his beauty . For is he not in advance of Robin and even hardy Crocus in his proclamation of the Spring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was strangling to death . There is no question then that Younger Brother was fortunateto conceive a loyalty to the colored man . Standing at the pond he heard the lapping of the water against the front fenders of the Model T. He noted that the hood was unlatched , and lifting and folding it back , saw that the wires had been torn from the engine . The sun was now setting and it threw a reflection of blue sky on the dark water of the pond . There ran through him a small current of rage , perhaps one one-hundredth , he knew , of what Coalhouse Walker must have felt , and it was salutary . Here , given subsequent events , it is important to mentionwhat little is known about Coalhouse Walker Jr . Apparently he was a native of St. Louis , Missouri . As a young man he had known and admired Scott Joplin and other St. Louis musicians and had paid for his piano studies with money he earned as a stevedore . There is no information about his parentage . At one point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife but that was never proved . There were never located any of his school records in St. Louis and it still is not known how he acquired his vocabulary and his manner of speaking . Perhaps by an act of will . It was widely reported when he was achieving his notoriety that Coalhouse Walker had never exhausted the peaceful and legal means of redress before taking the law into his own hands . This is not entirely true . He went to see three different attorneysrecommended by Father . In all cases they refused to represent him . He was advised to recover his automobile before it was totally wrecked and to forget the matter . To all three he insisted that he did n't want to forget the matter but to bring suit against the Fire Chief and men of the Emerald Isle Engine . Father himself telephoned one of these attorneys , a man who had represented his firm in several business matters . Is there not a case there , he asked . When he goes for his hearing , the lawyer said to Father , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me for this . When a property owner in this city walks into court with a Negro , a charge like this is usually dismissed . But he is not interested in the charge , Father said . He wants to sue . At that point Father realized the attorney was involved in a conversation with someone in his office . Glad to be of help , the attorney said , and rang off . It is known also that Coalhouse Walker consulted a black attorney in Harlem . He had learned that the Emerald Isle Chief , whose name was Will Conklin , was a stepbrother of the Judge of the City Court and a nephew of a County Alderman11521 11531 E. L. Doctorowin White Plains . The Harlem attorney advised him there were ways to divert the case to other jurisdictions but these were expensive and time-consuming . And the outcome was not at all predictable . You have the money for that ? the lawyer said . I am soon to be married , Coalhouse Walker said . That is an expensive proposition , the lawyer said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the need to redress a slight on the part of white folks . Then Walker appar- ently made a remark not entirely courteous to the black lawyer . The counselor stood up behind his desk and told him to leave . I have charity cases you know nothing of , he shouted . I want justice for our people so had I can taste it . But if you think I would go to Westchester County to plead on a colored man 's behalf that someone deposited a bucket of slops in his car , you are very much mistaken . It is known too that Coalhouse made a preliminary attempt to see the matter through as his own counsel . He had filed a complaint but did not know how to go about getting a place on the court calendar or what steps had to be taken to assure that it was correct in form in order to be heard . He appeared at City Hall for an interview with the Office of the County Clerk . It was suggested that he return another day when there was less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was then told that his complaint was not on file and that several weeks would be required to trace it . Come back then , the clerk told him . Instead he went to the police station where he had originally filed and wrote out a second complaint . The police- men on duty regarded him with amazement . An older officer took him aside and confided to him that he was probably filing in vain since the volunteer fire companies were not municipal employees and therefore did not come under the jurisdiction of the city . The contemptuousness of this logic did not escape Coalhouse but he chose not to argue with it . He signed his154 complaint and left and heard laughter behind him as he walked out the door . All of this happened over a period of two to three weeks . Later , when the name Coalhouse Walker came to symbolize murder and arson , these earlier attempts to find redress no longer mattered . Even at this date we ca n't condone the mayhemdone in his cause but it is important to know the truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's dinner table was now obsessive on the subject of this strange proud black man 's attempts to have his property restored . It seemed like such a foolish thing to have happened . It seemed to he his fault , somehow , because he was Negro and it was the kind of problem that would only adhere to a Negro . His monumental negritude sat in front of them like a centerpiece on the table . While Sarah served , Father told her that her fiance would have done better after all to drive away his car when he could and forget the matter . Younger Brother bristled . You speak like a man who has never been tested in his principles , he said . Father was so outraged by this remark that he could find no words . Mother said , gently , that no one would be helped by the voicing of intemperate feelings . A peculiar kind of unseasonablywarm breeze blew the window curtain in the Egyptian dining room . It had that breath of menace which makes the beginning of the spring so unsettling . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She retreated to the kitchen and held her baby . Sobbing she told Younger Brother , who followed her there , that the preceding Sunday Coalhouse had said he could not marry until he had been satisfied by the return of the Model T in exactly the same condition as when the firehorses had been driven across his path . Nobody knew Sarah 's last name or thought to ask . Where had she been born , and where had she lived , this impoverished uneducated black girl with such absolute conviction of the way human beings ought to conduct their lives ? In the few weeks of her happiness , between that time she accepted Coalhouse 's proposal and the first fears that her marriage would never happen , she had been transformed to the point of having a , new , a different face . Grief and anger had been a kind of physical pathology masking her true looks . Mother was awed by her beauty . She laughed and spoke in a mellifluous voice . They worked together on her wedding dress and her movementswere altogether graceful and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at herself in the mirror with pride . She laughed in joy of her own being . Her happiness flowed in the milk of her breasts and her baby grew quickly . He was pulling himself to his feet and the carriage was no longer safe for him . He stayed with her in her room . She picked him up and danced with him . She was a girl of perhaps eighteen or nineteen years , now satisfied that the circumstances of life gave reason to live . She was , Mother realized , the kind of moral being who understoodnothing but goodness . She had no guile and could actonly in total and helpless response to what she felt . If she loved she acted in love , if she was betrayed she was destroyed . These were the shining and dangerous facts of the life of an innocent . The boy was attracted to her more and more , and to her baby . He played gently with the child and there was solemn recognitionbetween them . The mother sang . She sewed her wedding costume and tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shift which rose to her hips as she pulled the white dress over her head . She saw the boy 's honest and attentive regard of her limbs and she smiled . To Younger Brother she offered the unspoken complicity of two members of the same generation . Her husband to be was an older man and Younger Brother was set apart by age from the others in his family . And that was why he followed her into the kitchen and she confided to him the news of Coalhouse 's vow not to marry until he had his car back . What will he do ? Younger Brother said . I do n't know , Sarah said . But she had perhaps detected the violence underlying all principle . The following Sunday , Coalhouse Walker did not appear for his visit . Sarah returned to her room . It was now clear to Father that the situation was deteriorating . He said it was ridiculous to allow a motorcar to take over everyone 's life as it now had . He decided to go the next day and talk to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What will you do , Mother said . I will make them see they are dealing with a property owner of this city , Father said . If that does n't work I will quite simply bribe them to repair the car and return it to my door . I will pay them money . I will buy them off . Mr. Walker would not like that , Mother said . Nevertheless , said ( rather , that 's what I 'm going to do . We will worry about explanations later . They are the town dregs and will respect money . But before the plan could he undertaken Sarah decided onE . L. Doctorowa course of action of her own . As it happened , this particular season was the spring of an election year : a candidate on the national Republican ticket , Mr. Taft 's Vice-President , James Sherman , was to be in New Rochelle that evening to speak at a Republican party dinner to be held at the Tidewaters Hotel . She had remembered overhearing Father discuss his reasons for not attending the event . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national unimportance of her Coalhouse'strials , Sarah conceived the idea of petitioning the United States on his behalf . It was the second of the frightened and desperate acts provoked from her innocence . She waited in the evening until her child was safely asleep , and wrapping a shawl about her head , left the house without telling any member of the family and ran down the hill to North Avenue . She was shoeless . She ran swiftly as a child . She was prepared to run all the way to the hotel but instead found a streetcar coming along , its interior lights flickering , the driver tolling its bell angrily as she dashed across the tracks just in front of it . She paid the fare and rode downtown . An evening wind came up and in the dark sky great heavy clouds massed for a rainstorm . She stood in front of the hotel among a small crowd of people awaiting the arrival of the great man . Car after car drove up and gave forth this dignitary or that . A few windswept drops of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the curb to the hotel doors . Not only the local police in their white evening gloves but a platoon of militia were on hand , keeping the entrance cleared and pushingthe crowd back from the street in anticipation of the arrival of the Vice-President 's car . The militia were in constant attendance , as well as plainclothesmen of the Secret Service which had been commissioned to protect presidents and vice-presidentsby Theodore Roosevelt after the assassination of PresidentMcKinley . As a matter of fact Roosevelt had come out of retirement this season to run against his old friend Taft. ( 1581RAGTIMEWilson was the Democratic candidate , Debs the Socialist , and the four campaigns whipped back and forth across the country , blowing up hopes on the land like the winds that ruffled the great plains . In Milwaukee , Wisconsin , just a week or so before , Roosevelt had arrived to make a speech . Leaving the railroad station and walking to a car he had been kept separate from a welcoming crowd . One man stepped out of the crowd and aimed a pistol at point-blank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spectacle case in Roosevelt 's breast pocket , ripped a hole in the fifty folded pages of his speech and lodged in his rib . He was stunned . The assassin was wrestled to the ground . There were shouts . Roosevelt examined his wound and was satisfied it was not serious . He went on to make his speech before he allowed doctors to treat him . But the acrid smoke of the act still lingered in the public mind . Anyone commissioned to guard a personage could not help thinking of the shooting of Teddy Roosevelt . New York City 's mayor , William J. Gaynor , had been bloodied by an assassin 's bullets not too long before . Guns were going off everywhere . When the Vice-President 's car , a Panhard , rolled up to the curb and the man himself stepped out , a cheer went up . Sunny Jim Sherman was a New York State politician with many friends in Westchester . He was a round balding man and in such ill health that he would not survive the campaign . Sarah broke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her confusion , President ! President ! Her arm was extended and her black hand reached toward him . He shrank from the contact . Perhaps in the dark windy evening of impending storm it seemed to Sherman 's guards that Sarah 's black hand was a weapon . A militiaman stepped forward and , with the deadly officiousness of armed men who protect the famous , brought the butt of his Springfield against Sarah 's chest as hard as he could . She fell . A Secret Service man jumped on top of her . The Vice-President disappeared into the hotel . In the **27;2350;TOOLONG / THE CHOIRBOYSers . General Hospital , my ass . Wonder what they 'll say when they find themselves looking at the ocean ? " Roscoe then spotted a black man in a business suit walking on Western Avenue with a young white woman in a green tailored jacket and skirt . She was obviously not one of the white prostitutes who worked the area so Roscoe kept his voice low when he drove by , looked in their direction and said , " Price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still buy a white pig for ten dollars ? " " You know , I never drove in a pursuit , " Whaddayamean Dean observed as he saw an LAPD traffic car zooming past them to overtake a speeder on Olympic Boulevard . " Remember one thing , babe , " Roscoe said , his voice droppingan octave as it always did when he assumed the role of training officer , " do n't never try to overtake a fast car on the outside when you 're going in a turn . Most cars 'll flip on a piece a spit . Hit him on the inner rear fender and he 'll eat the windshield . I once saw a freeway car drive a motherfucker right into an abutment by doing that . Sucker 's car blew up like a howitzer shell . Took four pricks off the welfare rolls permanent . And you got ta know when your engine 's gon na flame out . These hogs probably only top out at a hundred ten so you push it very long and you 'll probably throw a bearing , drop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a good pursuit . Makes you feel stupid . " In addition to knowing your car you got ta know all your equipment , " Roscoe continued , " like that peashooter you 're carrying . I wish I could talk you into buying a magnum and carrying some good , gut ripping hollow points in it . I want a gun that 'll stop some scrote when I need him stopped . After the prick 's dead I 'll worry about the ammunition being departmentapproved . I ever tell you about that abba dabba burglar my partner shot when I used to work the Watts car ? Ripping off a gas station when he set off the silent alarm . We were carrying those peashooters like you got . That sucker could run the hundred in ten flat till my partner shot him , and then he ran it in nine-nine . So I made a vow to get rid a this worthless ammo and get me some killing stuff . I made a study of velocity and shock . " Roscoe Rules and Dean Pratt / 41And then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " SevenA-Eighty-five . A possible jumper , Wilshire and Mariposa , " said the communications operator . " Handle the call code three . " Roscoe preferred working an extra car , called an " X-car , " because instead of saying " Seven-X-Eighty-five " or " Seven-Xray-Eighty-five , " he could improvise by saying , " **29;2379;TOOLONG , " or " **27;2410;TOOLONG . " Roscoe was falling in love with the voice of the radio operatoron frequency ten whom he had never seen . So Roscoe picked up the mike , pushed the button to send , made three kissing sounds and said , " This is Seven-Ay-ya-Eighty-five . I say **30;2439;TOOLONG , rrrrrajah on the call . " Then he released the button , turned to Whaddayamean Dean and said , " That 'll make her wet her pants . " And the radio operator , who was a fat , fifty-nine year old housewife with six children older than Roscoe Rules , turned to the operator on her left and said , " That guy on Seven-AEighty-fivesounds like an insufferable prick . " A janitor named Homer Tilden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receptionist named Melissa Monroe returned to the office some three hours after the buildingclosed and demanded to be let in on the pretext of having left an important document there . " I never shoulda let her in , it 's my fault , all my fault , " the plump black janitor later sobbed to detectives . Then the janitor pictured the pert smiling girl with the jazz age bob , who always yelled " Night , Mr. Tilden ! " when she left at night , and he burst into tears like a child . When Roscoe Rules and Dean Pratt arrived , red lights flashingand siren screaming , there was already a small group of morbid onlookers who had come across from the Ambassador Hotel . Homer Tilden led the two policemen to the elevator and up to the twenty-first floor where the young woman sat on the window ledge of her own office , feet dangling , looking down curiously at the crowd gathering . In the distance the wail of a fire department emergency vehicle trapped by WilshireBoulevard night traffic three blocks west . " Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her hair blowing42 / THE CHOIRBOYSwispily around her tiny ears as the two policemen ran from the elevator and burst into the office . " Go downstairs , " Roscoe said to Homer Tilden who was holding his chest and panting as though he had run the twentyonestories instead of taking the elevator . " Maybe I ... " " Go downstairs ! " Roscoe repeated . " There 's gon na be other people coming . " And as the janitor obeyed , Roscoe Rules began to imagine a picture and write-up in tomorrow 's Los Angeles Times if he could save the beautiful jumper . She was a fox and would surely rate an inside front page photo , along with her savior . " Look , miss , " Roscoe said and stepped forward . But the girl moved inches closer to her destiny , and Roscoe froze in his tracks . " Maybe we better back off , partner , " Dean whispered , looking for the moment far younger than his twenty-five years , his freckles swimming in streams of sweat . " We do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She 's a dingaling , and there 's ways to handle them . " Then to the girl Roscoe said , " Nothing 's as bad as that . Come on in . Let 's jaw about it . " He said it fliply with a grin and stepped forward , stopping when the girl moved forward another two inches and now teetered on the very edge , framed against the faded smoggy night sky of the Miracle Mile . " Oh no ! " Dean said . " No , miss ! Do n't go any closer ! Come on , partner , let 's go downstairs and give this lady a chance to think ! " But as Roscoe Rules saw a Times write-up and perhaps a police department medal of valor slipping through his fingers , he decided to try a different approach . He had seen Charles Laughton or someone do it successfully on an old TV movie . You could shame a jumper into surrendering . " All right then , goddamnit ! " Roscoe shouted to the girl . " You got your audience . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shit to you , it ai n't worth a shit to us . Go ahead , girl . We ca n't stay here all night babying you . We got other things to do . Go ahead , girl ! Jump ! " Roscoe Rules and Dean Pratt / 43And she did . Without a word or a tear she looked at Roscoe Rules and Dean Pratt and in fact never took her large violet eyes off them as she let herself slip from the ledge and fell at thirty-two feet per second squared , legs first , with a scream that was lost in a woosh of air and rustling skirt which had blown up over her face . What was left of Melissa Monroe was being covered by a sheet when Dean Pratt stumbled by on his way to the radio car . " Let me make the reports , partner , " Roscoe Rules said , and for the very first time Dean heard Roscoe 's voice quiver with uncertainty . Then Whaddayamean Dean looked at Melissa Monroe and said later it was as though God in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threw it at the Ambassador Hotel but missed and splattered the sidewalk on Wilshire Boulevard . Skull and body had exploded . Organs and brain littered the pavement . She was white and yellow and pink , covered with lumpy red sauce and syrup . Melissa Monroe had been turned into a raspberry sundae . Dean Pratt was very quiet for the rest of this bloodiest of all nights of his life . He thought they were finished when at the station Roscoe Rules finished writing his 15.7 report : that indispensablepolice document which handily covers all those policesituations which do not conveniently fit into a category such as robbery , burglary or vehicle theft . " Remember , partner , " Roscoe warned as they sat alone in the station coffee room , " as soon as the janitor left , she just jumped . Nothing was said by nobody . She just jumped ! " Dean Pratt nodded and sipped at a soft drink , longing for a water tumbler of straight bourbon as he had never longed for anything in his life . He hoped there might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home where his girlfriend left a small cache . He was terrified by barbiturates since drug use was an irrevocable firing offense . But he wanted to get loaded and sleep . At 11:00 P.M. Roscoe Rules dragged his partner out of the coffee room and said , " Come on , partner , let 's go do some police work . " 44 / THE CHOIRBOYS " Huh ? " " Come on , goddamnit , let 's hit the bricks . " Roscoe grinned . " We ai n't through yet . We still got forty-five minutes . " " Jesus Christ , " said Dean . " Come on ! " Roscoe commanded , his grin vanishing . He took Whaddayamean Dean very firmly by the arm and walked him out to the radio car . " Do n't go cuntish on me ! " Roscoe snarled when he drove away from the station . " As far as I 'm concerned we handled that call just right . If that whacko bitch wanted to take gas , fuck it , it ai n't our fault . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hairlessbrows puckered and whitened . " Fuck it ! Who cares if all these rotten motherfuckers take gas . They 're all shit sucking , miserable scrotes anyways . What the fuck 's a life anyway , less it 's yours ? " Still Dean did not answer and Roscoe unconsciously pulled at his crotch and raged on . " You bust a good felony and you tell him to throw up his hands . He do n't do it and there 's no witnesses , I say put him down . Understand ? Shoot em down like birds that shit on your roof . Remember that nigger and spick The Night My Balls Blew Up ? I 'm gon na get them someday . And I 'll worship the ground they 're laid under . You 'd like to blow em down , would n't you ? " " I guess so , " Dean nodded . " One nigger plus one spick equals a Mexi-coon ! " Roscoe shouted . " That 's my hard charging partner ! One a these nights we 'll get us a couple a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll show some a these so called cops with their withered nuts how a couple a honest to God hard chargers do it ! We 'll performa little retroactive birth control and blow the motherfuckersright outta their shoes with my magnum and your little peashooter ! " " I guess so , Roscoe , " Dean mumbled . Roscoe was unconsciously pushing the radio car eighty miles an hour on the Santa Monica Freeway , heading nowhere , feelingthe rush of cool wind , stroking himself while WhaddayameanDean watched the speedometer . And then they received the last radio call of the night . Roscoe Rules and Dean Pratt 145 " Seven-A-Eighty-five , Seven-Adam-Eighty-five , assist the traffic unit , Venice and Hauser . Code two . " " Seven-A-Eighty-five , roger , " Dean responded , banging the mike back in the holder , disgustedly jotting the location on the notebook pad . " Shit fuck ! " said Roscoe Rules , an expression he seldom used anymore since a former partner convinced him that it made him sound like a Central Avenue nigger . " I 've had enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was ready for code seven . " " Coulda used some chow myself , " said Roscoe . " Do n't the scrotes at communications have another car they can pick on ? Shit fuck ! Give her the handcuffs , partner . " Dean Pratt , as Roscoe Rules had taught him , opened the bracelet of his handcuffs , holding it next to the hand mike , and squeezed the bracelet through five or six times , making a ratchet sound very like a large zipper being ripped open and closed . Roscoe was convinced that the sound would be magnifiedin the operator 's radio headset . " Sounds like the jolly green giant opening his fly , do n't it , partner ? " Whaddayamean Dean nodded , suddenly a bit carsick . He had n't had a thing to eat for almost twenty-four hours . He had been in court all day and had come straight to work after testifying . And Roscoe Rules sitting there pulling on his dork was n't doing anything to settle his queasiness . " I ever tell you about that slopehead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Roscoe asked , in a downright jovial mood since this would be their last call . Even if it was a quickie he intended to make it an " end-ofwatcher , " by " milking " the time out and failing to clear when they were finished . " Do n't think you told me that one , " Dean sighed , by now deciding that he would rather have four fingers of bourbon than a hamburger . " This little gook was about fourteen , but retarded . Had the brain of a chicken and nearsighted to boot . We got a translator to tell her that fucking was good for her eyes . She was ugly as a busted blister . Just a little better than jacking off . Best part46 / THE CHOIRBOYSwas n't the pussy , it was cleaning her up ahead a time . We used to get these fifty cent rice paddy whores like her and throw them in this big wooden tub and eight or ten of us would get hot water and GI brushes and scrub the stink off them . Goddamn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and scrub every inch . Shit , we 'd take our clothes off and fall in the water and drink beer and wash those bitches . Seems kinda weird but it was more fun washing them than gang fucking them . " Dean nodded and leaned back while Roscoe drove west on Venice Boulevard and dreamed of thin young yellow bodies in soapy water . He had had many a lay but never had a more exciting sexual experience than scrubbing and lathering the rice paddy whores . Even now he got a blue veiner every time he held a bar of soap . " Shit fuck ! " Dean observed . " There it is ! " And there it was ! Traffic was snarled six blocks in every direction . Fifty people were milling around like ghouls , and two frantic traffic officers in white hats were trying to lay down a flare pattern to divert east and westbound traffic . Every eastbound lane was blocked by the wreckage of a spectacular four car collision . Roscoe pulled on his red lights , crossed the center divider and parked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got here , " said a heavy middle aged traffic policemanwho came running up with a handful of flares and spots of ash on his uniform . " Worst goddamn crash I seen in a long time . Drag race . Two cars laid down sixty feet of skids before they plowed into a northbound station wagon and knocked it clear back into the eastbound lanes . " What station wagon ? " Dean asked , adjusting his hat , gettinghis flashlight ready as he and Roscoe jogged back toward the wreckage where several souvenir hunters were already starting to prowl . " Get the hell out of here or you 're going to jail ! " the traffic officer shouted to the unkempt teenagers . " Everybody gone to the hospital ? " Roscoe asked , waving his flashlight violently at a car which was trying to get past the wreckage to go south on Ridgely Drive . " Two ambulances been here , " the traffic officer said . " You 're the only radio car to show up . The fucking fire departmentRoscoe Rules and Dean Pratt / @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead bodies jammed inside that station wagon ! " " Will someone tell me where the hell the station wagon is ? " Dean asked , holding a handful of flares , preparing to lay a pattern fifty feet south of the corner and divert the horn blowingcars through an east-west alley . " That 's it ! That 's the station wagon ! " the traffic officer said , pointing to a small heap of mangled steel which had knocked down the light standard , plunging the intersection into darkness . " It was cut in halfl " " Blow it out your ass , pizza face ! " Roscoe shouted to a sputteringacned man in a white Cadillac who was honking his horn and yelling as though he thought the policemen could magically sweep away ten tons of scrap metal and let him continue about his business which was to get to a west Hollywoodbar before it closed and try to pick up a thirty-five dollar prostitute . By now a dozen of the trapped cars were flashing their high beams in the policemen 's faces and blowing their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dean Pratt was laying flares . " Terrible wreck , " the traffic policeman muttered . " A woman in the station wagon was decapitated . She 's one of the ones still inside . " " Yeah ? " Roscoe said . He crossed the street , flashed his light at the heaps of debris in his path and stood beside the half of the station wagon , trying to make sense of the pile of mutilated flesh which had been a young couple . The tin cans and " Just Married " sign were still tied to the bumper . And then Roscoe Rules was reminded of one of the two hilarious photographs he carried in his wallet from his Vietnam days . " Oh yeah ! " said Roscoe Rules excitedly . " Move the flares , partner ! " he shouted to Dean , who was angrily waving his flashlight at the string of cars to get them moving through the alley , as at last the fire engines ' sirens could be heard . " What for ? " " I want them to pass by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " What for ? " 48 / THE CHOIRBOYS " I think it 'll be easier to divert them down the alley . " " Okay . " Dean shrugged , moving the line of flares , and then Roscoe Rules stood quietly on the far side of the station wagon , hoping the fire trucks or another ambulance would n't get there too quickly and spoil things . The first car to pass Roscoe was not suitable . The driver was well dressed , prosperous , just the kind of prick who 'd call in and make a complaint , Roscoe thought . Neither was the secondcar . The traffic was crawling by , most of the drivers gawkinghungrily for a glimpse of blood . The twelfth car in the line was perfect . It was a late model Dodge containing a man and two women . The bulging luggage rack , travel stickers and Ohio license said they were tourists passing through and not likely to take time to stop and complainabout a policeman , no matter the outrage . When the station wagon crawled by , Roscoe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encouragingly at the pudgy woman on the passenger side . Her window was down and she said , " Quite a wreck , eh , officer ? " " Yes , ma'am , " Roscoe answered , and he knew this was the one . " Over here , partner ! " he called to Whaddayamean Dean , since every legend needs a Boswell . The woman shook her head sadly and clucked . As her husband was revving the engine and the creeping traffic was starting , she said to Roscoe , " Anyone hurt bad ? " Then Roscoe Rules came from behind the wreckage and stepped to her window , lifting the dripping , severed head of the young bride , and said , " Yeah , this one got banged up a bit . " The woman from Ohio drowned out the fire engines ' sirens with her screams as her husband drove into the flow of traffic . Dean Pratt told the story to at least thirty policemen before going home that night . Roscoe Rules had achieved a place in police folklore , and was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Father Willie WrightWillie Wright was also destined to become a police celebrity . It happened four months before the choir practice killing . On the night he met a brother in the basement . Of course he could not have dreamed of the bizarre turns this tour of duty would take when he sat in the rollcall room late that afternoon and wished he could grow a moustache like the one belonging to Sam Niles of 7-A-29 , or Calvin Potts of 7-A-77 who had a heavy one which made the muscular black policeman look even more formidable . Willie was sure that if he grew one it would look like Francis Tanaguchi 's sparse and sad one , which many old women could duplicate . It was a peaceful , untraumatic rollcall that afternoon . LieutenantFinque was on a day off and Sergeant Yanov sat before them alone at his table on the platform . " Got an unusual one last night , " Sergeant Yanov said , trying to look through the crimes to find one that might amuse the watch . " Guy tried to shove a Pepsi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stepping out on him . " " I took that report , " said Sam Niles . " It was nothing . The bottle did n't have the cap on it . " 50 / THE CHOIRBOYS " Reminds me of the guy stuck a screwdriver up his ass to scratch his prostate . Remember that , partner ? " Roscoe asked Whaddayamean Dean . " Could n't get it out and the wife called the police . That was funny ! " Rules chuckled as he pulled at his crotch and made Harold Bloomguard sick . Then Roscoe blushed and got angry when Sergeant Yanov said , " By the way , an unnamed officer turned in a report last night where he wrote a pursesnatcher was 1-e-r-k-i-n-g and p-r-a-y-i-n-g on his victims . Check the dictionary if you 're not sure . These reports end up in courts of law . Makes us look dumb . " " I told you to check my spelling , goddamnit , " Roscoe whispered to Dean Pratt who smiled weakly and said , " Sorry , part-ner . " " One word of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is uptight about the pissy wino they found sleeping in the back of Sergeant Sneed 's car . They suspect one of you guys put him there . " " Me ? Why me all the time ? " Francis Tanaguchi cried when all eyes turned to him . " Gee , rollcalls are quiet without the lieutenant here , " observedSpermwhale Whalen , who then turned to Willie Wright and said , " Hey , kid , how about comin in the bathroom with me ? My back 's hurt and I ai n't supposed to lift nothin heavy . " Spencer Van Moot was happy when rollcall ended early . It gave him more time to shop . Spencer was , at forty , the second oldest choirboy , next to fifty-two year old Spermwhale Whalen , the two of them the only choirboys over thirty . SpencerVan Moot had convinced Harold Bloomguard that he should be accepted as a MacArthur Park choirboy because he was only temporarily married , was hated by his wife Tootie and her three kids and would probably soon be thrice divorced like Spermwhale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same reason he welcomed Roscoe Rules . He invited Spencer Van Moot because he was the most artistic scrounger and promoterat Wilshire Station . Spencer knew every retail store within a mile of his beat . His " police discounts " had furnished his house princely . I le woreSpencer Van Moot and Father Willie Wright / 51the finest Italian imports from the racks of the Miracle Mile clothing stores . He dined superbly in one of three expensive restaurants near Wilshire and Catalina which were actually in Rampart Division . Retailers became convinced that Spencer Van Moot could ward off burglars , shoplifters , fire and vandalism . That somehow this tall blond recruiting poster policeman with the confident jaw and the small foppish moustache could even forestall economic reversal . Despite his natural morose nature and his self pitying complaintsabout his unhappy marriage , he was accepted at once by the choirboys . He arrived with a dowry of three cases of cold beer and four bottles of Chivas Regal Scotch . And he brought his partner , Willie Wright . Willie was one of the smallest choirboys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five feet nine inches tall . Willie in fact had stretched to make five feet eight and was almost disqualified when he took his first police physical . He was a devoutly religious young man , raised as a Baptist , converted to Jehovah 's Witnesses when he married Geneva Smythe , his high school sweetheart . Willie was now twentyfourand Geneva twenty-five . She , like Willie , was short and chubby . She took Watchtower magazines door to door three times a week . Willie accompanied her on his days off . Spencer Van Moot loved him as a partner because Willie thought it was crooked to accept gifts or wholesale prices from retail stores , thereby leaving Spencer a double share of everything he could promote . The only concession Willie would make was a nightly free meal in one of Spencer Van Moot 's gourmet restaurants . After being practically dragged to the first choir practice by Spencer , Willie Wright discovered something totally extraordinary : that choir practice was fun , more fun in fact than anything he had ever done in his young life . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he entertainedthem by preaching squeaky sermons . He told them how wrong it was to drink and lust after the two camp followers , Ora Lee Tingle and Carolina Moon , who often turned up at choir practice . But then when drunk he turned into an evil eyed little mustang. 52 / THE CHOIRBOYSHarold Bloomguard dubbed him official chaplain of the MacArthur Park choirboys . He was thereafter known as The Padre , Father Willie Wright . The night that Father Willie Wright personally called for choir practice was the night he found the brother in the basement . It had begun much like every other night , with Spencer Van Moot driving the radio car madly to all of his various stops before the stores closed . First he had to make three cigarette stops where he picked up two packs of cigarettes for each of them , which Father Willie did n't use . Father Willie suspected quite rightly that Spencer wholesaled the cigarettes to his neighbors . And then there was the dairy stop where Spencer got his daily allotment of buttermilk and yogurt , one quart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night at 10:00 P.M. the manager walked swiftly to his car under the protectivebeam of Spencer 's spotlight . Then there were other stops , if he could get them in , at various men 's shops on Wilshire Boulevard where Spencer and salesmen tossed around Italian names like Brioni and Valentino and which invariably ended in Spencer 's trying on something in a fine cabretta leather jacket over his blue police uniform . Father Willie sat bored in the dressing room holding his partner 's Sam Browne , gun and hat while Spencer preened . Sometimes a new salesman would make the mistake of quotingthe retail price to the tall policeman and would find himself cowering before an indignant stare , a twitching toothbrush moustache and a withering piece of advice to " Check with the manager about my police discount . " Father Willie often thought about asking for a new partner but he did n't want to hurt Spencer 's feelings . Spencer had tried for years to find a partner like Father Willie , who would not accept his rightful share of free cigarettes , wholesale merchandiseand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spencerbreaking in new partners : " You smoke ? " " No , Spencer . " " Today you do . I 'll take both packs if you do n't want them . " And inevitably a partner would become greedy . " I 'll take a pack today , Spencer . " Spencer Van Moot and Father Willie Wright / 53 " What for ? You do n't smoke . " " I 'll give them to my brother . What the hell , three packs a day I 'm entitled to . " Spencer got to keep Willie 's share of petty booty in every case . And Father Willie never complained when Spencer scrounged up some liquor for choir practices . " We 're having a retirement party for one of our detective lieutenants , " Spencer would inevitably lie to a long suffering liquor store proprietor who would take two bottles of Scotch from the shelf behind him . " We 're having a big big party . " Spencer would smile benignlyuntil the proprietor would get the message and bring up another two bottles . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the same liquor store more than once a month for anything but cigarettes . The cigarette stop however was a relentless daily ritual . It was said that during the Watts riot of 1965 , Spencer drove a half burned black and white with every window shot out ten miles to Beverly Boulevard , his face streaked with soot and sweat , and managed to make all three cigarette stops before the stores closed at 2:00 A.M.Spencer Van Moot had accepted a thousand packs of cigarettes and as many free meals in his time . And though he had bought enough clothing at wholesale prices to dress a dozen movie stars , he had never even considered taking a five dollar bill nor was one ever offered except once when he stopped a Chicago grocer in Los Angeles on vacation . The police departmentand its members made an exact distinction between petty gratuities and cash offerings , which were considered money bribes no matter how slight and would result in a mercilessdismissal as well as criminal prosecution . It was not that the citizens and police of Los Angeles were inherently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the West , being a network of sprawling young towns and cities , did not lend itself to the old intimate teeming ward or ghetto where political patronage and organized crime bedded down together . The numbers racket , for instance , had been a dismal failure in western America . The average citizen of Los Angeles had n't the faintest idea how it worked . Yet in the Pennsylvania steel town where Spencer Van Moot was born , 54 I THE CHOIRBOYSevery living soul had played numbers and consulted dream books for winners and contributed to organized crime 's greatestsource of revenue in that region . The bookies came door to door . They even accepted children 's penny bets . Western criminals had found it impossible to organize a crazy quilt collection of several communities which existed inside the 460 square mile limits of the city , where there was an automobile for every adult . The city had geography and history going for it . So it was that Spencer Van Moot 's supplication provided about half of the beverage consumed at choir practice , the rest provided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liquor store owners on his beat . After making his various stops and depositing his treasures in the back of his camper truck in the station parking lot , Spencer began whining again about his unhappy domestic life . " I mean how can you understand a woman , Padre ? " Spencer complained as the setting sun filtered through the smog and burned Father Willie 's sensitive , bulging blue eyes . " I do n't know , Spencer , " Father Willie sighed , and wondered how long Spencer would use him as a sounding board tonight . Sometimes when he was lucky the complaining would stop after the first two hours of their tour of duty . " I 'm forty years old , Father Willie , " Spencer griped , touching his twenty dollar haircut which he got free in a Wilshire Boulevard styling parlor . " Look at my hair , it 's getting gray . Why should I live in such misery . " " I 'm twenty-four , " Father Willie reminded him , " and you have more hair than I do . Who cares @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bitch , Padre . It 's hell , believe me , " Spencer whined . " She 's worse by far than my first two wives put together . And she 's turned her kids against me . They hate me more than she does because she tells them lies about me , that I drink a lot and run around with other women . " " That 's not a lie , Spencer , " Father Willie reminded him . " You do drink a lot and run around with other women . " " It 's nothing to tell teenagers , for god 's sake ! " Spencer answered . " I never shoulda married an older broad with kids . Damn , forty-two years old and her legs 're turning green . Green , I tell you ! And here I am with only four years to go untilSpencer Van Moot and Father Willie Wright l 55I can pull the pin and retire . And what happens , she gets knocked up ! " " Maybe it 'll work out , Spencer , " Father Willie offered as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun 's dying harsh rays . " Work out ? Work out ? Four years to my pension and she 's gon na foal , and then how can I retire with a little rug rat crawling around ? " " Oh well , " Father Willie shrugged . " Oh well . " " A man gets drunk and careless and screws himself into another ten years on the job . It ai n't fair . " " Oh well , " said Father Willie . " Everything happens to me ! " Spencer said . Spencer Van Moot was interrupted for a moment by catching a glimpse of a seventy year old pensioner who lived in a Seventh Street fleabag called the Restful Arms Motel . He pushed his wheelchair down the sidewalk backward with his foot as he held his useless arthritic hands in his lap . The pensionerwas trying to get to the mom-and-pop market one block west where he could buy two cans of nutritious dog food for his dinner . " Things could always be worse , Spencer . " " Oh sure , I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ... " " You 've got a new camper . You can get away with your wife sometimes and go fishing . " " Oh sure . I got a new camper . I 'm so thrilled , so happy ! I 'm in debt again . I was getting insecure not owing money . " " It 'll work out . " " Yeah , it will . I 'll be dead soon . No one in my family lives very long . I got an uncle that died of old age at forty-five . That 's what the doctor said . Every organ in the man 's body was old , dissipated . I wo n't last long . At least then I 'll be rid of my old lady . I tell you , Padre , she 's got a tongue so sharp it 's a wonder she do n't cut her mouth to pieces and bleed to death . " " You want to come to church with Geneva and me ? " Father Willie offered . " Some of the best Witnesses I know came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early deaths in your family ... " 56 / THE CHOIRBOYS " Goddamnit , I ai n't dead yet ! " Spencer cried , suddenly frightened . " Padre , gim me a chance ! I ai n't lived yet ! " " Well , I only meant with poor health and all ... " " Poor health ? Poor health ? I 'm too young to be thinking about dying . Jesus , partner , you 're getting morbid ! " It was almost an hour before Spencer fully recovered from the suggestion of his imminent demise . He had the worst sick record on the nightwatch . He was tall and strong , in the prime of life , and had seen vats of spilled blood and acres of mutilated flesh in his sixteen years of police work , but he became faint when he 'd scratch his finger . He could bear any pain but his own . Just before dark they passed the Mary Sinclair Adams Home for Girls , a funded institution where young women who were pregnant and indigent could be cared for . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hancock Park and had once been a palatial residence of an eighty year old virgin who died envying young girls the fun they had growing round bellies . There was a teenage girl with an eight month stomach standing in front of the house : cigarette dangling , eyebrows plucked to nothing , eyes shadowed to three inch black orbs , talking to three young men on chopper motorcycles . " The Stork Club , " Spencer remarked , shaking his head disgustedly . " They go in there , drop a frog and cut out . " " I hear the county 's okayed the installation of interuterine devices in some of these girls they place in foster homes , " Father Willie said . " Someone shoulda plugged my old lady 's birdbath and I would n't be in this fix , " Spencer answered , blowing a cloud of smoke out the window . " Old dried up sponge , I do n't know how she ever got knocked up . I 'll just have to cut down on expenses , live like a goddamn Trappist monk . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being anymore , that 's all . " " It 'll work out all right , " Father Willie said . Then , " Spencer , we 'll still be able to eat roast duckling with orange sauce , wo n't we ? " " Oh sure . " " With glazed carrots and shallots ? " " Oh , we 'll still eat at our restaurants for free just like weSpencer Van Moot and Father Willie Wright / 57always have , " said Spencer , allaying Father Willie 's fears . " I meant at home I 'll have to starve . My wife and kids 'll have to go without and maybe wear old clothes with patches . " Father Willie felt like suggesting Spencer could make patcheswith some of the fourteen Italian suits which hung in his closet , when he spotted a Lincoln blow the red light on Wilshireand Western . The Lincoln pulled over the moment FatherWillie tooted his horn . " You just have to learn to budget , " Spencer sighed as they gathered up hats and ticket book and flashlights now that dusk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bill to the gas company and theirs to the electric company . By the time they send them back and forth you can balance your checkbook . " Father Willie nodded as they got out of the black and white Matador and walked forward , crisscrossing so that Father Willie , whose turn it was , could approach the driver 's side while Spencer went to the other side and shined the light in the window to protect Father Willie 's approach . The driver , a balding fat man about Spencer 's age , smiled and said , " What 's the problem , boys ? " He offered Father Williehis driver 's license without being asked . " You were a full second late on that red light , sir , " Father Willie said , his light on the license , checking that it was not expired , noting the Beverly Hills address in Trousdale Estates . " That does n't seem possible , " the man said , getting out of the car and following the little officer to the police car where Spencer waited in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sir , " Father Willie warned , as a car sped by very close to the Matador which was stopped behind the Lincoln , three feet farther into the traffic lane to protect the approachingofficer from being picked off by a motorist who might be driving HUA which meant : Head Up Ass . " Officer ! " the fat man appealed to Spencer as Father Willie began to write the ticket on the hood of the radio car . " Surely I was n't late on the red light , and if I was I did n't mean it . " He offered Spencer his business card which said , " Murray Fern 's Stereo Emporium . " Spencer Van Moot 's eyes brightened with visions of a new stereo system in his barroom at home . At wholesale , of course. 58 / THE CHOIRBOYS He was about to suggest to his partner that Mr. Fern probably deserved some professional courtesy when he saw that it was too late . The ticket was already started , and since they were numbered it was impossible to cancel one without a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the busi- ness card back to the man . " You gon na write me a ticket ? " Murray Fern asked Father Willie . " Yes sir , " Father Willie said , never looking up as he wrote . " Why me ? Why me ? " Murray Fern demanded , reminding Father Willie of Spencer . " You ran a red light , sir , " Father Willie said , looking up for the first time then continuing with the citation . " But I ca n't get another ticket . One more and they 'll sus- pend my license . Christ , gim me a break ! " Father Willie did not answer but continued to write in em- barrassed silence . " Just my luck to get stopped by a couple of pricks , " the fat man said as he paced in a tight circle . " A couple of ticket hungry , heartless pricks . " Now Spencer Van Moot no longer cared about a cut rate stereo set and looked around the rear of the car for a taillight violation that Willie could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit , ticket happy , stupid fucking pricks ! " Murray Fern said as Father Willie continued his writing with- out comment . " Sign on the line , " Spencer said coldly , speaking for the first time . " Fuck you , " said Murray Fern . " I 'm innocent and I 'm not signing . " " You 're not admitting guilt , " Father Willie said quietly . " If you do n't sign , thereby promising to appear , we 'll have to take you in and book you on the violation . " " Prick ! " the fat man said , brushing Father Willie 's ballpoint aside , taking a gold plated fountain pen from his inside coat pocket and leaning on the hood to study the ticket . " It 's only a promise . . . " " I know what the fuck it is ! " the man interrupted . " What I 'd like to know is why you tinhorns are n't out catching criminals instead of harassing honest citizens , that 's what I 'd like to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ticket and turned his back on the two officers while Father Willie tore off the violator 's copy and handed it to him along with his driver 's license . " I 'll see you in court ! " Murray Fern sputtered as he snatched his copy and license from Father Willie 's hand . " I 'll have a lawyer . I 'll beat you . I 'll make you go to court on your day off and I 'll make you look like the dumb shit you are ! " He spun around and jammed the ticket , pen and license into his coat pocket . But when he jerked his hand out , a tiny .25 caliber automatic clattered to the pavement . " Oh shit , " said Murray Fern bleakly as Spencer Van Moot quickly pulled and pointed his .38 at the fat man 's eyes . " Who says there 's no God ? " Father Willie grinned happily . " I only carry a gun when I make bank deposits , " croaked Murray Fern . " I know it 's against the law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ na put me in jail for something as petty as this ? " " Who says there 's no God ? " Father Willie repeated as he drew his handcuffs . By the time the two policemen obtained the booking approvaland ran a record check on Murray Fern who had three drunk driving arrests , but no other criminal record , the fat man had threatened every officer at Wilshire Station with a lawsuit . It was 8:30 P.M. when they stood with Murray Fern in front of the booking officer , Elwood Banks , a fifty-year old black man and former partner of Spencer Van Moot . " How 's the retail trade in Los Angeles holdin up ? " he asked Spencer when they brought the prisoner inside the lockup . " Fair to middling , Elwood , " Spencer answered . " Booking this guy for CCW . " " Kinda old to be playin with guns , ai n't you , Dad ? " commentedElwood Banks , looking up from his typewriter as he inserted a booking form . " I 'll sue you too , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more smart remark and I 'll put you on the lawsuit . " Sitting on a bench to the side of the booking cage , waiting60 / THE CHOIRBOYSto be fingerprinted , was a tall , once powerful derelict with a bloody wet bandage over one eye . He was forty-eight years old , looked sixty-five , and had fought with the officers who had arrested him for plain drunk . The assault on the officers made him a felon now , but his fourteen page rap sheet included fifty-four arrests for only plain drunk and vagrancy , so now he would be tried and sentenced as a misdemeanant . Elwood Banks knew the derelict as Timothy " Clicketyclack " Reilly , so called because his ill-fitting false teeth clicked together when he talked . Elwood Banks had booked Clicketyclackthree times in the past , had never known him to be violent and rightly guessed that the young arresting officer , Roscoe Rules , had antagonized the derelict . His smashed nose and scarred eyes should have been a tip-off to Roscoe . Clicketyclackhad once been a ranked heavyweight . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merely said what he said to every arresting officer from Boston to Los Angeles : " I could whip you , Officer . In a fair fight I could whip you from here to East Fifth Street , know that ? " And most arresting officers answered something like : " Yeah , Clickety-clack , I know you could  --  in a fair fight . But if you try it , it ai n't gon na be a fair fight cause my partner and me and half the nightwatch are gon na work out on your gourd with our sticks and do the fandango on your kisser . But in a fair fight you 'd kick my ass , that 's for sure . " And Clickety-clack would be satisfied . But on this night when he made the same speech to Roscoe Rules , Roscoe replied , " Oh yeah , you 're gon na whip me , old man ? " And then in the corridor of Wilshire Station by the front desk in the presence of luscious Officer Reba Hadley whom he was trying to impress , Roscoe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desk , stood on the balls of his feet in front of the hulking derelict , put on his black gloves dramatically , both fists on his hips and said , " You think you can whip my ass , you wrinkled wart ? You stinking tub a puke . Think you can whip me in a fair fight , huh ? " And Clickety-clack just said , " Yeah . " And from a corner of his all but destroyed brain , he found a memory , a rhythm , anSpencer Van Moot and Father Willie Wright / 61instinct and sent a picture left hook whistling through the air . Roscoe Rules woke up three minutes later in the lap of luscious Officer Reba Hadley who said to him , " You dumb shit . " Clickety-clack Reilly was of course buried by five or six blue uniforms and ended up with a badly cut lip and three more stitches in his eyes which made no difference at all to that caved in , monstrous face . But now he sat , calm and secure and happy in the jail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thereby eliminating the possibility of further problems for himself . " You okay , Mister Reilly ? " he asked when Spencer and FatherWillie entered the jail with Murray Fern . " Mind if I book this prisoner for these officers so they can get back out on the street ? " " No , Officer , I do n't mind , " the derelict smiled painfully to the black jailor . He looked as though he would love to hear it again , that word applied to him so seldom in his bitter lonely life . " Thanks a lot , Mister Reilly , " Elwood Banks said . " We 'll just be a minute . " " Glad to hear you quit eatin in those greasy spoons down on Jefferson , " Elwood Banks said to Spencer without even looking at Murray Fern . Then to Father Willie , " Once we was eatin in this soul kitchen and we caught a momma cockroach and three babies crawlin on his plate . Spencer just told them to fry it . It was free . " " My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I knew you was n't the soul food type at heart , Spencer , " Elwood Banks said . Then he turned to Murray Fern and said , " Name ? " " Go to hell , " the arrestee answered . " Man , your face is red as a bucket a blood , " Elwood Banks said . " Calm down , make it easy on yourself . " " I 'm including you in the lawsuit , " said Murray Fern . " You 're sure lucky you got these easygoin officers here , " Elwood Banks said . " You was busted by an officer named Roscoe Rules he 'd a been up side your head long ago . They 'd a needed a sewing machine to put in the stitches . " " I demand an attorney . " 62 / THE CHOIRBOYS " After you 're booked you can call one , " said Elwood Banks . " I demand an MD . I 'm on medication for a serious allergy . " " Ai n't none here , " Elwood Banks said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want , right now before they book you . " " That 'll take too long . I 'm bailing out of here at once . " " Then why do you want a doctor ? " " Because I do . I demand an MD be brought here . " " Well there ai n't none here . " " Then I demand an RN . " " You keep this shit up and you 're gon na get an RIN , " the black jailor informed him . " What 's that ? " asked Murray Fern . " A rap in the nuts . Now gim me your full name and address . " " I refuse to answer . " " That does it , " Elwood Banks said , his lip curling as he came out from behind the counter . " I usually search after booking but I 'm gon na make an exception . Strip down . " " What ? " Murray Fern asked nervously . " What are you gon na do ? " " Nothin . If you do like I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his LAPD badge was highly polished , his feet were spread as he stood before the fat white man whose courage and insolence were in direct proportion to what was on his body and in his pockets . Or as Elwood Banks often put it , " Strip em down and show em what they are : nothin ! " " You want me to take off all my clothes ? " Murray Fern asked , looking from one policeman to another as Elwood Banks reached roughly into his pockets , removing his wallet , keys , handkerchief , cigarettes and chewing gum . " Turn em inside out , " Elwood Banks said , and Murray Fern obeyed , trying to beat the jailor to the pockets , fearing he would rip them . " Satisfied ? " Murray Fern asked , when everything including his Patek Philippe wristwatch was on the counter . " No way , baby , " said Elwood Banks . " Get them fancy threads off that chubby body and on the counter . I mean strip and do it now ! " Thirty seconds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only ninety dollar boots of imported SwissSpencer Van Moot and Father Willie Wright / 63leather , knee length blue silk socks , and silk boxer shorts dottedwith tiny hearts . " Satisfied ? " he asked again , but now his authoritative baritonewas a tenuous rasp and his eyes darted past the men to the corridor outside . " I said strip , damnit ! " Elwood Banks ordered . " Now get them boots and britches off before I rip em off ? " In a moment Murray Fern stood utterly naked before them , turning his body to one side and another , his composure breakingto pieces before their eyes , the rolls of textured fat shaking as he squirmed and wriggled with nowhere to hide . " Turn around and bend over and spread your cheeks , Murray , " Elwood Banks said , for the first time using the fat man 's name . " Bend over ? " " Bend over and show me that round brown , " Elwood Banks said . " I got ta see if you 're hiding a machine gun in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was told Elwood Banks said , " Humph , my kid 's basset hound got better markins than that . Okay , boy , lift your feet up one at a time and show me the bottoms . " Murray Fern obeyed quickly and quietly . When he was finished , Elwood Banks said , " Okay , Murray , now turn around and face me and open your mouth and lift up your balls . We do n't want you rat-holin twenty bucks in some little crease down there . You ca n't be no better off than Mr. Reilly when we lock you in the tank together . " As Murray Fern opened his mouth for inspection he unconsciouslyheld his hands over his shriveled penis , which was lost in the hair and layers of overhanging fat . Elwood Banks then delivered the coup de grace . " Okay , Murray , now take your hands away and skin your wee wee back . I once knew a bookie kept bettin markers hid under his foreskin . " When the search and booking were finished , Murray Fern was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soft wealthy white man could be subdued as easily as a black pimp could be mastered by the threat to book his flash money as evidence . As easily as a fighting derelict could be pacified simply by calling64 / THE CHOIRBOYShim " sir " and " mister . " Elwood Banks had never set foot in a college classroom , but life had made him a psychologist . " Wan na use the phone now , Murray ? " Elwood Banks asked when he finished the fingerprinting and offered Murray Fern a cigarette . " Yes sir , " said Murray Fern , who was ever so grateful to the black jailor for giving him his silk underwear with the little hearts , a cigarette and a dime for a phone call . After booking Murray Fern , Spencer longed to get up to Wilshire Boulevard and eat liver pate and poached turbot with sauteed cucumbers . But Father Willie made the mistake of clearing on the radio and they were given a call at once . " Seven-A-Thirty-three , Seven-Adam-Thirty-three , see the woman , Eleventh and Ardmore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eleven fifteen ! Goddamnit , Padre , how many times I told you about picking up that frigging mike and clearing ? " " I know , Spencer , I know , " Willie answered . " You 're too goddamn conscientious ! " " I know . " " Wait 'll you been on the job awhile . You think the sergeants care we bust our balls ? You think that cunt Lieutenant Finque cares ? " " I know , Spencer , I know . " " Christ , I got a headache already . All that jawing from that fat prick , Murray Fern . My head aches and I 'm sick to my stomach . " " I know . " " I did n't get my vichyssoise tonight , for chrissake . " " I 'm sorry . " " I did n't get my veau a la creme . " " There 's nothing I can do ... " " And I had my heart set on maybe some Coquilles St. Jacques Parisienne ! " Spencer cried . " Is that the one with scallops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Provencale . This is the one with scallops and mushrooms . " " In a white wine sauce ? " " Yeah . " " I like that one . " Spencer Van Moot and Father Willie Wright / 65 " And I had my heart set on some artichoke hearts and truffles ! " Spencer continued . " Oh God ! " " I 'm really awful sorry , Spencer , " Father Willie said . " When you started working with me you thought all menus were printed on the wall . I trained you ! " reminded Spencer Van Moot . " I know , Spencer , I know . " " And this is the thanks I get . All because you 're so goddamn gung ho and have to pick up the mike and clear . Now I got ta smell a dead body instead of a souffle au chocolat ! Oh God ! " " I 'll make it up to you , Spencer , " promised Father Willie , wondering when he was going to learn to act like a veteran . A wizened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beer on the porch of a two story frame house just south of the corner . She waved as Spencer flashed their spotlightaround , hoping not to find the caller . Spencer lagged behind disgustedly as they parked , and gatheredup his flashlight and hat slowly . He always put the hat on while looking in the rearview mirror so as not to disturb the hairstyle . " Yes , ma'am ? " Father Willie turned his light on the porch steps as the old woman drained the can without getting out of her rocking chair . She steamed like dank mulching weeds . " Think my tenant 's dead in the basement , " the old woman grinned in triumph . " What makes you think . . . uh , oh , " said Spencer as he got to the top step of the porch and smelled the tenant who made them forget the old woman 's putrescence . " When did you discover him ? " Father Willie asked , as Spencersneered , thinking he would have to endure this instead of peach Melba . " Ai n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out without paying the rent . Sort of discovered him , you might say , about an hour ago when the wind started stirring things around . " Spencer sighed and nodded and led Father Willie through the musty hallway of the boardinghouse which was partitioned off to accommodate seven single men . They found the basementdoor slightly ajar. 66 / THE CHOIRBOYS " Wonder if that witch is drinking beer or bat milk ? " Spencer remarked . " He 's down there all right , " Father Willie said , almost retchingas they tried the stairs . Then Spencer found the light switch and led Father Willie down the ancient wooden stairway where next to a gravityheatfurnace they found the tenant hanging from the ceiling joists , his knees almost dragging the ground . " Kee-rist ! " Spencer said , forgetting the overpowering smell for a moment . The neck of the hanging man was almost ten inches long and the dragging legs formed a bridge for a column of ants which trooped up his legs to his face and ears and nose where they nested and fed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man 's neck which Father Willie realized were rat bites after he saw the mounds of droppings on the floor beneath the hanging man . " Wonder how long he 's been hanging around here ? " Spencerquipped to his little partner who had a handkerchief pressed to his nose . " He probably reached the end of his rope , " Spencer said , but Father Willie did n't hear Spencer 's gags . Willie Wright had not seen that many dead men in his three year police career and he was struck by the youth of this man and by the swollen hands darkened by draining blood and by the gray face which looked as if it belonged in a wax cabinet . And though the elongated neck shocked him , because he did not dream it could happen like this , he was most shocked because for the first time in twenty-four years Father Willie Wright realized something . He looked at that one dull eye open and truly believed that he would join the waxen hanging man . That they were brothers going somewhere . Or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a basic truth for the first time . But Father Willie , not knowing the source of his fear , became very frightened by the hunk of fat in his belly and had a hard time keeping Spencer Van Moot from noticing . This was the night that Father Willie Wright encouraged the others to go to choir practice . It was the first time Father Willie had been the prime mover . Spencer Van Moot and Father Willie Wright / 67And later that very night , perhaps because of the hanging man , Father Willie Wright was to become a beloved MacArthurPark choirboy for what he did to put that hoity toity bitch , Officer Reba Hadley , in her place . There were two Officer Hadleys , no relation , in Wilshire Division : Phillip Hadley , a policeman on the daywatch , and Reba Hadley , the policewoman on the nightwatch . So as to know which Hadley one was talking about , the other officers referred to them as Balls Hadley and No-Balls Hadley . No-Balls Hadley was on the nightwatch desk . She had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Business Administrationfrom UCLA , and believed that the brass of the departmentwas discriminating against women by not promoting them past the rank of sergeant . And by humiliating women in forcing them to undergo the same police training as the men . She felt it was degrading and ludicrous that women in patrol assignments had to wear short hair and a man 's uniform completeto the trousers and hat , obviously an attempt by the brass to discourage those women who had been forced on them . Of course she was right . She also vociferously proclaimed that it took little or no brains or administrative ability to wrestle a pukey drunk into a radio car , to chase and subdue a burglar in an alley or to drive a high speed chase after some joyriding bubblegummer . She was again right . No-Balls Hadley , who was sometimes called Dickless Tracy , was also right when she declared fearlessly at a policewomen 's meeting attended by chauvinist spies for Commander Moss that he , as well as most high ranking officers of the department , had little or no street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could pass exams , not because they were street cops . So No-Balls Hadley was considered a rabble-rouser and troublemakerby those high ranking members of the Los Angeles Police Department who believed that women had some value in rape cases , juvenile investigations and public relations . But otherwise should keep their big fat insecure libber mouths shut because they were probably bull dykes at heart and were out to steal men 's jobs . No-Balls Hadley knew that the brass68 / THE CHOIRBOYSwas not about to give up those jobs since they had kissed so many asses to get them . In short , No-Balls Hadley was intelligent , articulate , courageousand correct most of the time . She was utterly feminine , with long shapely legs , tapering fingers , honey colored bobbed hair , naturally jutting young breasts . She was also discriminatingin the men she dated , preferring professional men of breeding and affluence , thus dashing the hopes of everypoliceman on the Wilshire nightwatch . For this reason she was considered an insufferable bitch and it took the person who loved her more than anyone on earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work at 2:00 A.M. on the night Father Willie found the brother in the basement . Father Willie was dozing drunkenly at choir practice in MacArthur Park when Spencer Van Moot grabbed the little man by the jaws . " Leave me alone , Spencer , " Willie squeaked while his partnerheld him by the chin , saying , " Get up , Padre . Goddamnit , wake up ! " " The hanging man ! " Father Willie cried in confusion as the earth heaved . " The hanging man ! " " Never mind the hanging man , " Spencer said . " Bloomguard and Niles just showed up . They been at a party at Sergeant Yanov 's apartment . We 're all going over there . " " No , no , " Father Willie moaned , and tried to lie back down on his blanket but Spencer would n't have it . Father Willie was the last choirboy to arise . The others were already gunning their car motors , turning on lights , driving toward the apartment near Fourth and Bronson where the bachelor sergeant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he occasionally threw an impromptu party of his own . " Come on , Padre , " Spencer said , dragging the little man to his feet , careful not to get any of the duck slime from Willie 's checkered bermuda shorts on his fifty-five dollar tie dyed jeans with the needlepoint patches which he had bought at a police discount from a men 's store on Beverly Boulevard . " Father Willie , listen ! No-Balls Hadley 's there ! " And Father Willie 's swollen eyelids cracked apart . The littleSpencer Van Moot and Father Willie Wright / 69man shook his thin wheat-colored hair out of his eyes , shot a hopeful grin at his partner and took his arm as Spencer led him to the car on Parkview Street just south of Wilshire . " You sobering up ? " Spencer asked as he drove them in FatherWillie 's station wagon , a five year old Dodge with a " God Is Love " bumper sticker on front and back . " Yes , " said Father Willie who was getting drunker with each bump and rumble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for No-Balls Hadley whom he never discussedwhile sober . He had succeeded in driving away his sweet obsessive fantasiesexcept for those infrequent moments when his Jehovah 's Witness wife would consent to a five minute straight lay withouttoo much annoying foreplay . At those times it was not the plump little Witness he was mounting , but Officer Reba Hadley , No-Balls Hadley of the splendid breasts , elegant legs and caustic tongue who never so much as glanced at little Father Willie Wright when he passed the desk and screwed up enough courage to say , " Good afternoon " or " Good evening " or " The desk pretty busy tonight ? " She would sometimes mumble a perfunctory reply when not busy with a ringing phone or routine report which she felt beneath her to write in the first place . But once , as she leaned on the counter chatting into the telephone , dressed in the tailored blue long sleeved blouse and fitted skirt of a desk officer , instead of a man 's uniform like a female patrol officer , she asked Father Willie if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machine because she had three crime reports going and could n't leave the phone . Father Willie Wright dropped his pocket change all over the floor in his haste to get the coins in the machine and was careful not to spill a single drop as he set it before No-Balls Hadley as reverently as any real priest ever offered a chalice at the altar . No-Balls Hadley said into the phone , " Look , Madge , we have to have the nerve to walk into the chief 's office and say what we think . Of course he hates our guts but he 's afraid of us now . We 've got the media with us . Damn it , Madge , what 've we got to lose ? You think I want to spend a career standing at this desk70 / THE CHOIRBOYSwriting bike reports and making inane small talk to a bunch of semiliterate slobs ? " One of the semiliterate slobs of whom she spoke stood shyly across the counter , the large gap in his front teeth bared to No-Balls Hadley who had forgotten he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counter in front of her . " Just a minute , Madge , " she said testily into the mouthpiece , then held her hand over it and said , " Officer ... " " Wright , " Father Willie said . " Willie Wright 's my name ! " " Yes , of course , " she said impatiently . " You think I do n't know every man on the nightwatch ? I 've only been chained to this desk six months . I ought to know . " " Oh sure , " said Father Willie , who was so plain , so small , so unassuming that she could never remember his name . " Listen , Wright , did you want something ? " " Oh no , " Father Willie said to the tall girl while his mad impetuous young heart longed to say , " Oh yes ! Oh yes , Reba ! Oh yes ! " He had never called her " Reba , " never once in the six months she had been in Wilshire Division after being transferredfrom Parker Center where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what do you want then , Wright ? How about taking your dime and excusing me ? I have this important call . " " Sure , Officer Hadley . " Father Willie reddened and turned awkwardly . " Just a minute , Wright . Take your dime for the drink . " " Oh no , " Willie mumbled . " It 's my pleasure . Honestly , " Take the dime , " said No-Balls Hadley , her eyes narrowing as she momentarily forgot the phone she held pressed in her hands . " Really , it 's my ... " " Look , buster , " No-Balls Hadley said , " I pay my own way just like every officer in this station . I do n't need you to buy my Bubble-up . Now you take this dime ! " Father Willie snatched the dime in his sweaty hand , scurried down the steps to the parking lot , got in the radio car and roared out onto Venice Boulevard . Spencer Van Moot and Father Willie Wright / 71 " What 's the matter with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's brick red face . " Nothing . Nothing . " Father Willie had vowed to forget No-Balls Hadley but found to his shame and dismay that she was even more desirable . When Spencer and Father Willie arrived at the party at Sergeant Yanov 's apartment , Willie had not been thinking of his previous unsuccessful encounter with No-Balls Hadley . His gin ravaged brain would not admit those warnings and fears which keep most men from achieving celebrity . When Father Willie Wright set foot in that raucous smoke filled steamy apartment he was roaring drunk . He squirmed past sweaty bodies which danced wall to wall in the suffocating rooms . The party spilled out onto the balcony and even extended to the pool where at least a dozen clerks from Wilshire and Rampart and Hollywood stations swam bikini clad while goatish policemen swam naked until the apartment house manager threatened to call the police  --  the ones with clothes on . The men then swam in their underwear or trousers until the manager scurried back inside then stripped again . Father Willie 's protuberant blue eyes were red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crowd . The smoke was making him slightly sick and defeated when he heard it coming from the bedroom . Her voice ! " Listen , Sheila , " she was saying to Officer Sheila Franklin , a personable brunette who worked Juvenile at Central , " I want to leave right this minute and I do n't care if you are worried about Nick Yanov 's feelings . Damn it , he should control these stupid disgusting drunks if he expects people to stay at the party . Of course I got out of the pool ! I 'm not staying there while these pea brained chest beaters swim around nude ! I 'm not interested in Sergeant Nick Yanov or any of these creeps and I only came here because you ... " And as Father Willie strained to hear the voice of his secret love , Francis Tanaguchi abruptly changed the tape from Elton John to The Carpenters because he had finally managed to get a dance with Ida Keely , a cute communications operator with72 / THE CHOIRBOYSeyes like a deer . He had a blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how it was in years gone by and the good times that I hadMakes today seem rather sadso much has changed . Officer Sheila Franklin sighed , stood and made her way out of the cluttered bedroom where most of the living room furniturehad been pushed to make room for the dancers . She stopped before opening the door and said , " All right , Reba , I 've asked you to be sociable and stay a little while because you know how I feel about Nick Yanov . But if you have togo ... " " I can call a cab . You stay . " " Damn it , Reba , I brought you here . I 'll take you back to your car . But you know something ? It 's not a rough party . They 're just dancing and ... " " I was practically mauled in the swimming pool ! " " One drunk grabbed your ass . Come on , Reba , you 're a cop too , for God 's sake . They 're just a little drunk . " " I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no , I 'll tell Nick we 're leaving . Go ahead and change . " And then as Father Willie ducked into the bathroom the partially opened bedroom door swung open and Sheila Franklin , still wearing her wet bikini under a blue terry cloth robe , crossed the hallway and went out a side door which opened onto a terrace where Sergeant Nick Yanov sat playing nickel and dime poker with five other policemen . It was songs of love that I would sing to them And I 'd memorize each word . Those old melodies still sound so good to me As they melt the years away . No-Balls Hadley still sat where Sheila Franklin had left her . On a large glass coffee table . In her wet bathing suit . A shortSpencer Van Moot and Father Willie Wright / 73robe she had borrowed from Nick Yanov covered her sleek flesh as Father Willie Wright quietly pushed open the door behind her . The sound of No-Balls Hadley 's voice . The heart searing voice of Karen Carpenter . The unbearable nostalgia of his high school days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Father Willie Wright had very little to do with what happened next . Seldom has a legend been born more spontaneously . All my best memories come back clearly to me , Some can even make me cry just like before . It 's yesterday once more . First , Father Willie tried to formulate a perfect sentence : something tender , loving , endearing but he could not . He leaned against the wall , unseen behind No-Balls Hadley . Breathing became labored . Nostrils flared . Bulging eyes rolled back in unbearable ecstasy and passion . Like Byron on the Acropolis . Ev'ry sha-la-la-la , ev'ry wo-oh-wo-oh still shinesEv'ry shing-a-ling-ling that they 're startin ' to sing so fine . He knew instinctively that this was his moment . His life had led him here . Behind her where she sat perched on the glass table , pissed off at her friend Sheila Franklin and these swinish policemen and men in general . And no man could have stopped what happened next when , still wearing the short robe , she slipped off her bikini bottom and kicked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The coffee table was suddenly cold on the bare buttocks of No-Balls Hadley and she tried to tuck the robe under her as she thought again of that fat hairy ugly pig , Spermwhale Whalen , and how he had tried to dive under the water and grab her by the ass . As she sat fuming on the glass coffee table , Father Willie Wright knew he was not worthy to touch this exquisite golden girl who had filled his young life with torment and guilt. 74 / THE CHOIRBOYSEv'ry sha-la-la-la , ev'ry wo-oh-wo-oh still shinesEv'ry shing-a-ling-ling that they 're startin ' to sing so fine .. . Father Willie Wright found himself on his knees crawling across the red carpet . Without willing it he was on his back worming forward under the glass table . Then No-Balls Hadley thought she heard something . A sound , wet and sticky . But with the noise in the living room she dismissed it and smoldered and waited for her friend , determinednot even to go in the other room to get her clothes . She would let Sheila bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another drunken cop . She heard the sound again . Louder . A smacking sound , close but somehow distant . Then she heard it directly beneath her ! She uncrossed her legs and spread them and looked down in horror at the white and bloodless nose and lips of Father Willie Wright pressed against the underside of the glass table , smearingthe glass directly beneath her bare bottom with wet and loving kisses while his blue eyes crossed and bulged from the meticulous maddening scrutiny of the golden twat of his beloved . No-Balls Hadley screamed . She shrieked in consummate disgustas Father Willie Wright , unaware that she was gone from the glass , still slurped tenderly and vaguely wondered what someone was yelling about . No-Balls Hadley screamed . And screamed . Before the first three policemen had burst through the door Father Willie realized that something was wrong , his face pressed like a fish against the smeary wet glass , eyes popping . Then Father Willie understood that he was discovered . " God love ya ! " Father Willie whispered reverently just before No-Balls Hadley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the tempered glass while all hell broke loose around the confused and troubled choirboy chaplain . Then someone pulled him out from under the table to save him while No-Balls Hadley grabbed a three iron from the golf bag of Sergeant Nick Yanov and began breaking chunks from the glass . Father Willie went skidding across the floor , Spencer Van Moot dragging him by the heels . Spencer Van Moot and Father Willie Wright l 75Someone wrestled the three iron from No-Balls Hadley who yelled , " You filthy disgusting obscene little motherfucker- ! I 'll kill you ! " She tore a picture from the wall and threw it crashing through the bedroom window to the terrace outside where it thudded against the side of the head of a poker player , sending him to the emergency ward for five stitches . No-Balls Hadley , minus her robe which had been pulled away by a policeman trying to restrain her , clad only in a green bikini top , began beating Father Willie Wright back against the sliding closet door and kicking him in the soft belly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pummeling him with both fists as he covered his little face with both arms saying , " But I love you , Officer Hadley . Do n't you see ? " Finally , Sergeant Nick Yanov , one of the few sober policemenat the party , overpowered the spitting kicking cursing policewoman and dragged her still naked into the other bedroom where Officer Sheila Franklin got her in a wristlock until she fell exhausted , blurting what Father Willie had done . As the bleeding bewildered Father Willie Wright was being carried to his car by Spencer Van Moot and Harold Bloomguard , he turned his battered face to Harold Bloomguard and said , " What 'd I do wrong , Harold ? What 'd I do ? " " I 'll tell you what you did , Padre ! You put that hoity-toity bitch No-Balls Hadley in her place , is all ! " Harold Bloomguard cried proudly as they carried Father Willie down the sidewalk . " You just became a Legend in Your Own Time ! " From that day on , in choirboy folklore , the episode of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eat Pressed Ham Through the Wrapper. 77-A-77 : Calvin Pottsand Francis TanaguchiA choir practice was certainly in order and was called for by Francis Tanaguchi on The Night the U-Boat Was Decommissioned . It was three months before the killing in MacArthur Park . The night was bound to be an extraordinary one , beginning as it did with a noisy argument in which the nightwatch ganged up on Lieutenant Finque who was trying to defend the department 's disciplinary policies to the rebellious assembly of bluesuited young men who thought he was full of shit . " Look , " the exasperated watch commander argued , " that West Los Angeles officer deserved thirty days off for what he did . " " Deserved ? Deserved ? " Spermwhale Whalen thundered .

" Fuckin pussies run this outfit , " Spermwhale growled , settlingdown a little under the placating grin of Sergeant Yanov . " I know why all the brass downtown go up to Chinatown for lunch .

You probably remind her of him . " 78 / THE CHOIRBOYS " Well she 's not my type and I got better things to do , " Spencer answered , and then he got mad as the assembly room exploded into hoots and laughter because everyone but LieutenantFinque knew that Spencer 's better things to do were bargain hunting on Wilshire Boulevard . " It 's time we hit the streets , " Lieutenant Finque repeated , since he believed that a lieutenant should never let a sergeant , especially one as lenient as Nick Yanov , take over the rollcall . Unquestionably , the biggest pain in the ass on the nightwatchat Wilshire Station was Francis Tanaguchi . He was twenty-five years old , a third generation Japanese-American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and spoke good street Spanish but not a word of Japanese . He adored guacamole , chile relleno , barbacoa , menudo , albondigas soup and tequila with anything . He hated sushi , tempura , teriyaki steak , sake and could not operate a pair of chopsticks to save his life . As a teenage member of a Chicano youth gang he had spraypainted " Peewee Raiders " on more walls than any other gang member . Still , he was never totally accepted by Mexican boys who lumped all Orientals together by invariably nicknaming them " Chino " or " Chink . " Francis fought to be called " Francisco " or at least " Pancho " but settled for " Chink-ano . " It stayed with him until he joined the Los Angeles Police Departmentat the age of twenty-one . Gradually he found it was advantageous to be Japanese . There were many Mexican-American policemen but there were few Japanese-American policemen , even though Los Angeleshas the largest Japanese-American population in California . Sometimes Francis and his black partner , Calvin Potts , had profound philosophical discussions about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ na get somewhere in the department I got ta be a Buddhahead , " Francis moaned to his partner . " You think you got problems ? " Calvin remarked . " How about me ? How 'd you like to be a brother in your paddy world , huh ? " " Who said I 'm a paddy for chrissake ? " Francis answered . " Goddamnit , I 'm a Mexican . " Calvin Potts and Francis Tanaguchi l 79 " You 're a Nip , Francis , " Calvin reminded him . " So quit calling me a paddy . " " You all look alike . " " It 's goddamn hard becoming a Jap when you 're my age . I been at it four years now and I still ca n't take a picture or mow a lawn straight . " " You think you got it rough , " Calvin said . " How 'd you like to have other policemen put you down when you date a white chick . How 'd you like that , Francis ? " " I ai n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's because I 'm drunk when I date a white chick . I get drunk to stop the hurt . " " You get drunk when you date any chick .

" How 'd you like to get sick to your stomach every time you look a fish head in the eye ? " " I do get sick to my stomach every time I look a fish head in the eye . " " Yeah , but that asshole Lieutenant Finque ai n't trying to duke you into the Oriental community by using you as a part time community relations officer at Japanese luncheons where you force down three raw squid and puke all the way to Daniel Freeman Hospital afterward .

" Calvin Potts , at twenty-eight , was three years older than Francis Tanaguchi and had been a policeman two years longer . He was tall , athletic , divorced , the son of a Los Angeles bail bondsman . He had been raised in Baldwin Hills when there were only a few black families on the hill . He had dated girls and women of all colors all his life . In truth he seldom had any trouble with racial slur . It would n't have bothered him much if he had . He was an alcoholic because his father was an alcoholic , as was a brother , a sister , two uncles and numerous80 / THE CHOIRBOYScousins . He came from a hard drinking family . He had been a Scotch drinker at sixteen . He was also an alcoholic because he was insane about his ex-wife , Martha Twogood Potts , whose father was one of the most successful black trial lawyers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the second year of their marriage , after several reasonably successful sexual encounters with more marriageable men , that she had been goofy to marry a no-account cop . She scooped Calvin Jr . out of the crib and called her daddy who convinced a Superior Court judge that it would not be unreasonable for Officer Calvin Potts to pay child support and alimony equal to thirty-five percent of his net pay . This left fifteen percent for the car payment , twenty-five percent for food , twenty percent for gas and car repairs , and forty percent for an enormous personal loan he incurred getting started lavishly in married life . Since the total outlay was 135 percent , Calvin remedied the situation by letting the Mercedes be repossessed and buying a secondhandgearless Schwinn bicycle which he rode back and forth to work . He then divided the twenty-five percent food allowanceinto two equal parts , half for food and half for booze , and discovered that twelve and a half percent of a policeman 's net salary would not buy enough booze for even an average alcoholic . So he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a part time telephone operator who made certain calls on company time which earned her up to two hundred dollars a night when she got home . Calvin Potts had been working with Francis Tanaguchi for six months and they had become inseparable . Calvin could not begin to understand this since he hated people in general and Francis Tanaguchi was by all odds the biggest pain in the ass at Wilshire Station . But there it was . They were always together . Everyone called them The Gook and The Spook . There were several very good reasons why Francis Tanaguchiwas such an enormous pain in the ass . He did annoying things , some of which were cyclical , some more or less permanent . One of the permanent annoying things he was accused of doing was arranging calls to the other choirboys ' residences at 4:00 A.M. A mysterious woman with a lasciviously voluptuCalvinPotts and Francis Tanaguchi / 81ous voice would begin to talk as the sleepy choirboy was comingawake in the darkness . The listener would be treated to a low crooning lush sexual litany which could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vein and muscle into a diamond cutter . Though it was generally suspected that FrancisTanaguchi was responsible for these bizarre calls , it was never proved and he never admitted it . Drunk and sober , Calvin Potts had begged threatened and bribed him to no avail . No one had ever seen the Dragon Lady , as they had come to call the owner of the voice . And no one had ever been able to hang up once she was into her routine . All had wet dreams about her . The wife of Spencer Van Moot had left him for the third time when she , on another phone extension , heard the erotic , blood boiling promises . Perhaps the greatest harm was done to Father Willie Wright one night as his fat dumpling of a wife lay snoring beside him . Father Willie answered the phone and sat galvanized in the darkness while the Dragon Lady promised to use her body and Willie 's in a way that any reasonable man should have known was physically impossible . But Father Willie was not reasonableat this moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was speechless and frenzied . The Dragon Lady began making incredibly luxurious , unwholesome , juicy noises . Then she hung up . Father Willie lay there for a moment then fell on the sleepingJehovah 's Witness who only tolerated sex when she was awake and prepared for it . The next afternoon before roll call , Father Willie Wright , his left eye blood red from a desperate blow by a chubby little fist in the night , waited at Francis Tanaguchi 's locker and challengedhim to a fight to the death in the basement of Wilshire Police Station . Calvin Potts and several other officers intercededwhile Francis professed total innocence . Father Williewas led into the rollcall room swallowing tears of rage , swearing for the very first time in anyone 's memory . " Ya fuck , ya ! " yelled Father Willie . " Ya dirty slant-eyed heathengodless little fuck , ya ! " Francis Tanaguchi had other annoying habits , not the least82 / THE CHOIRBOYSof which was biting people on the neck . It started when Fran- cis went to a shabby Melrose Boulevard movie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a college crowd which hooted and yelled and smoked pot and ate pop- corn . Francis was with a chilly clerk typist named Daphne Simon who worked the morning watch at Wilshire Records and sel- dom dated policemen because she felt they were too horny . Francis had won her heart by sending a thirty dollar floral arrangement which he had gotten free by stopping at a Japa- nese nursery near Crenshaw Boulevard and thrilling the immi- grant proprietors with his blue clad Oriental body . Francis had only planned to try to get them to bounce for a handful of violets , but when he saw how delighted they were with him , he promoted the soft multicolored carnations . As he sat in the smoke filled movie house , Daphne Simon roughly pulled his hand out from between her legs every time he let it accidentally fall there . It made him wish he had saved the flowers for Ora Lee Tingle at choir practice . Francis Tanaguchi came to dislike Daphne Simon who was in some exotic way giving him a blue veiner by squeezing his hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the seats . But if he was starting to dislike Daphne Simon he was falling in love with Bela Lugosi . " You wan na go where , Francis ? " Calvin Potts squinted , when Francis settled into the black and white the next after- noon . " To that big costume store on Western , " Francis repeated . " You goin to a masquerade ? " " No . " " I know , you 're gon na buy a polar bear suit for you and Ora Lee to wear while you flog each other with dead baby ducks at the next choir practice . " " I 'm gon na buy some fangs , " Francis said simply . For three weeks , which was about as long as one of Francis ' whims lasted , he was called the Nisei Nipper by the policemen at Wilshire Station . He skulked around the station with two blood dripping fangs slipped over his incisors , attacking the throat of everyone below the rank of sergeant . Calvin Potts and Francis Tanaguchi 183 " It was okay for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Potts one day . " But those frigging teeth hurt . And it starts to get really depressing having Francis draped around your neck all the time . " And even as he spoke Francis leaped from behind a wall and onto Spencer 's back , nipping him on the neck with the gory plastic fangs . Sam Niles finally came to work with a bullet painted silver and let Francis see him putting it in his gun . Harold Bloomguard hung parsley over his locker and told Francis it was wolfsbane . Then Whaddayamean Dean , and finally everyone else , started carrying crosses to ward off the Oriental vampire who would hiss and snarl when a cross was produced and slink back to his locker until he spotted someone with his back turned . Spermwhale Whalen finally grabbed Francis by the collar and said , " There 's so fuckin many crosses around this locker room it looks like a platoon a nuns ' dresses here . Francis , I 'm gon na stick those goofy teeth right up your skinny ass if you do n't knock it off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tired of tasting all these crummy necks anyway , " Francis said , and the vampire returned to earth permanently . The night that Francis got bloody hands and decommis- sioned the U-boat was a smoggy evening in late spring . It started as usual with Calvin complaining that he always drove . " Looky here , Francis , I been on the job longer than you , and I been on this miserable earth longer and I do n't know why the fuck I let you jive me around like this . " " Like what ? " " Like drivin you around like a fuckin chauffeur every night . " " I write better English than you so you should drive while I should keep books . " " You what ? You write half the time like some ignorant wet- back . You did n't learn no English in those Chicano East L.A. schools . " " Well you drive better than me . " " Bullshit . You ever seen a brother drivin at Indianapolis ? " 84 / THE CHOIRBOYS " You ever seen a Buddhahead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driver even than a brother . " " Tomorrow you drive . " " I ca n't . I do n't want nobody to see me with glasses on . They make me look like an Iwo Jima sniper . It embarrasses me . " " I never seen you with glasses . " " I only wear them when I wan na see . " " And we been partners all this time and you never wanted to see ? " " There 's nothing on this job I wan na see , Calvin . The only time I put em on is when other guys take em off . I put em on to get laid . That 's all I wan na see anymore . " " Do you put em on at choir practice when you ball Ora Lee Tingle or Carolina Moon ? " " No , that 's another thing I do n't wan na see . " Then Calvin started getting sullen . It came over him more frequently of late and he was drinking more than ever before . He had been forcing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Twogood Potts and her sleek caramel flesh . But he could not repress his thoughts of Calvin Jr . and how the toddler hardly knew him now and did not even want to be with his father on weekends . And how he truly did n't want the boy with him in the apartment of Lottie LaFarb , even though she was a kind-hearted telephone operator and barely a prostituteand lavished him with pussy and what money she had and loved Calvin Jr . unequivocally . Sometimes he wanted to beat the shit out of Lottie LaFarb and Francis Tanaguchi , the only two people in the world who , he felt , gave a damn whether or not he stuck that Smith K-38 in his mouth and blew the top of his skull all over the tobacco stained plastic headliner in that black and white Matador which at the moment smelled of urine and vomit from the drunk the daywatch had booked near end-of-watch . Calvin Potts ' surging anger was broken when the honey voice the choirboys had come to love said , " Seven-A-Seventyseven , Seven-A-Seventy-seven , see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Cloverdale . " " That 's us , Calvin , " Francis said jauntily , jotting the call on the pad affixed to the hotsheet holder on the dashboard . Calvin Potts and Francis Tanaguchi 185 " Well , roger it then , goddamnit , " Calvin said viciously . " Seven-A-Seventy-seven , roger , " Francis said , looking at his partner whose coffee face was polished by the dipping hazy sunlight as they drove west at dusk . " What 're you pissed off at , Calvin ? " " Nothin . I 'm just gettin sick and tired a workin this car . Why ca n't we go back up to the north end next month ? " " We can . I thought you wanted action . " " I 'm sick a action . I 'm sick a these eastside trashy niggers that 've took over this area down here . I 'd rather work the Fairfax beat . I could easier put up with all the Hebes in Kosher Canyon chippin their teeth every time you give them a ticket . " " Okay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ north end car next month . I know what you need . " " What ? " " A little trim . " " Oh yeah , just what I need , " said Calvin looking skyward for a disgusted instant . " I know Lottie 's taking care of your everyday needs but I got a special one just moved in my apartment building . Meant to tell you about her . " " The Dragon Lady ? " Calvin said suddenly , and for a moment he felt the depression subside a bit . " Now , Calvin , you know I do n't know any more about the Dragon Lady than you guys , " said Francis , with his attempt at an inscrutable mysterious Oriental grin . " Well , what 's she like ? " " Better than that lanky one we met at the party in the Hollywood Hills . " " She better be . " " Too bad you did n't score with that one . " " Yeah , well she woulda came on in if it was n't for that lawyer throwin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . People just wear me down when they start that bull-shit . " " It 's all he has going for him , " Francis observed . " I bet she woulda got up off some pussy if I coulda showed a few fifty dollar bills . " 86 / THE CHOIRBOYS " If you got ta buy it it ai n't worth it . " " I woulda bought it that night . I was hurtin for certain . She had me by the joint , you know . " " Sure . " " I told you that , did n't I ? " " Another alcoholic fantasy , Calvin . You better come down off that Johnnie Walker bottle you 're living in . " " Listen , you slant eyed little fenderhead , I 'm tellin you she was lopin my mule under the table . " " Calvin , you were so bombed that night even the Dragon Lady couldn't 've given you a blue veiner . I mean a black veiner . " " Now you 're wearin me down , Francis . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Calvin Potts was glaring at Francis and almost failed to stand on the brakes in time to keep from broadsiding a dilapidated ten year old Pontiac which had limped onto Adams Boulevard from the driveway of Elmer 's Barbeque Kitchen which was one half block from the family dispute call . " Gud-damn ! " Calvin yelled to the driver of the Pontiac who managed a frightened smile and gripped the steering wheel nervously with big dusty work-hard hands , his knuckles like walnuts . " Wh000-eee ! " the driver said and stopped in the traffic lane to wait a command from the black and white which pulled up on his right in the number two lane . " A gud-damn , Mississippi-transplanted , chittlin eatin nig- ger , " Calvin moaned as he switched on his red light and debated going to the call or writing a ticket first . Francis settled it for him . " I 'm up , Calvin . " " Okay , write him then , " " I do n't wan na write him , Calvin . He does n't look like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him then . " " I 'm up . I 'm giving up my turn on him . You write the next one . " " Sorry , Officer , " the driver said as the black policeman glared at him . " I ai n't used to Los Angeles traffic . I 'm jist a country boy . " Calvin Potts and Francis Tanaguchi / 87 " Drive a tractor then , asshole ! " Calvin yelled , switching off the red light and speeding to the call at Adams and Cloverdale where they found two bleary-eyed black women in print housedresses and shower shoes arguing in front of the bar . " You call ? " Francis asked , putting on his hat while Calvin merely shook his head and , cap in hand , followed the two women and Francis inside . The two policemen found four other combatants all more or less allied against a thirtyish buxom mulatto woman who sat in a corner booth sipping a milkball and tearing at a fat stick of beef jerky . " There 's the bitch that 's causin all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two women who had led them inside . " Yeah , you hussy , " said the other one before the beefeater could speak . " She been livin wif my uncle . My uncle jist up and passed away and she wan na do the funeral , and she think she be gittin the house and the car because this old man wif a brain like pigfeet made some kinda raggedy ass agreement she think is a legal will ! " " She spend all my uncle 's bread on wine and beer , " said a bony customer at the bar . " Whadda you spend your old woman 's bread on , bastard ? " the buxom young woman answered . And then to Francis , " We was livin common law . " " They ai n't no common law in this state , bitch , " said the smaller of the two women who stepped toward the booth but was stopped by Calvin who walked in front of her . " Lemme talk to you private , " Calvin said and only then did she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the silent jukebox in the corner of the bar . " What 's happenin here , baby ? " Calvin asked when they were alone . " Well see , I was this funky ol man 's main momma . I give that man two a the best years he ever had . Ever time I turn aroun he was wantin some face scoldin . Baby , I got calluses on the inside of my mouth from that evil old fool . I woulda went steppin when he died but these people got on my case heavy the first day the ol man was dead . Shoot , I jist decided I was gon na stay and fight for what 's mine . " 88 / THE CHOIRBOYS " That all there is ? " " Nothin to it , baby , " the woman said and smiled at Calvin for the first time , stepping in close and touching his chest with her swooping breasts . Just then the man at the bar lurched forward drunkenly saying , " Do n't you believe nothin this hussy says about my uncle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she was usin that ol man . " The man was holding something in his arms pressed tightly against his ribs and in the gloom of the bar room it looked like a rusty bath towel . Then Calvin noticed it was leaking down onto the man 's cracked leather wing tips and then to the grimy floor . " Man , you 're bleedin ! " " Yeah , " the man said . " I is . " And as though embarrassed , he pulled the filthy towel away and a mucous trickle spurted out of the puncture in his chest and ran down his rib cage to the floor . The wound bubbled and gaped a bit larger with every breath he took . " That bitch done it to me . " " Okay , bastard ! " said the buxom heiress . " Now I 'm gon na show em what you done to me ! " As she spoke she squirmed and wriggled and hiked her tight dress over her wobbly buttocks and displayed a soppy Kotex which had been pressed inside her blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inch knife wound across the hip and stomach which peeled back flesh and fat and bared a sliver of gleaming hipbone . " What the fuck is goin on ? " Calvin exploded , waving Francis over and pointing at both ugly wounds . " You said you was n't gon na say nothin if I did n't say nothin , you funky ol devil ! " the heiress complained . " Well , he ast me , bitch . What was I gon na say , that I was holdin a pack a bloody meat in this here towel ? " " Did you get cut in the fracas ? " Francis asked , shocked at the slash across her belly . " No , bout five inches above it , " the woman answered . " So , who cut who ? " Calvin demanded , disgusted because now they would have to make crime reports and likely book both antagonists in a " mutual combat " situation so common to ghetto policemen . Calvin Potts and Francis Tanaguchi l 89 " I fell on a ice pick , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Francis asked the heiress . " I fell on a butcher knife , " she answered . " Tell me somethin , " the man said as Francis squinted in the bleak dusty light at the chest hole and finally stepped forward to watch the sinister little orifice blow and foam as the man breathed . " If somebody was to attack somebody wif a ice pick , and this here other somebody was to defend hisself wif a butcher knife , would this somebody wif a butcher knife go to jail ? " Before the policemen could answer , the heiress added , " And if this motherfuckin dawg of a lyin wino was really the one to attack a woman with a butcher knife and she had to defend herself with a ice pick , would n't this woman be a righteous victim of this other evil of motherfucker ? She would n't go to jail , would she ? " " Anybody else see this ? " Francis asked , but everyone suddenlyturned to his beer for some serious drinking . " The detectives would book em @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Calvin scowled contemptuously . " And before it got to a court trial there 'd be three continuances by the two defendantsand in the end they 'd both agree not to prosecute each other and it 'd be a big motherfuckin waste of my time and the taxpayers ' money . " " Kin you give me a ride to the hospital ? " asked the heiress . " You wan na make a crime report against him ? " " No . " " Take the bus , " Calvin said . " The doctor 'll sew you up for free . It 's an emergency . " " Do n't they send you a bill ? " she asked , and finally tamped the Kotex compress back into place and squirmed the dress back down . " Sure , but jist put it with the rest a your bills inside the hole in your shoe . " " Calvin , we better take him anyway , " Francis said . " That 's a chest puncture . This man 's hurt bad . " " You wan na @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " No , " the man said and the breath made a rattling bubble on his chest and a soft pop when it burst. 90 / THE CHOIRBOYS " Groovy , " Calvin said , heading for the door . " Dist take two aspirin and stay in bed tomorrow . " " He 's hurt bad , Calvin . " Francis had to run to catch his long striding partner outside on the sidewalk . " Hey , jump back , Jack ! I made my decision . I ai n't fuckin with no more a these people . If they wan na rip each other from the lips to the hips , let em go head on ! " " He could die . His lung could collapse . " " You ca n't kill these niggers , Francis . I was broke in on the job by a cracker named Dixie Suggs who hated black people like you hate squid . He taught me you got ta practically cut off their heads and shrink em to kill the motherfuckers . Damn , let 's work a north @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better than niggers . " " Okay , Calvin , okay . " Francis watched his partner for a moment before raising the hand mike to clear from the call . They cruised , Calvin smoking quietly , until darkness settled . Then Calvin patted the breast pocket of his uniform and said , " Let 's stop by Easy 's and get some smokes . " Francis , who had been drinking heavily the night before , was dozing in his seat , his head bobbing on his chest every few seconds , his long black hair hanging over his thin face as small as a boy 's . " We get a call ? " Francis asked , fumbling for the pencil in his shirt pocket . " Go back to sleep , Francis . We did n't get no call . " Calvin made a lazy turn onto Venice Boulevard to the liquor store run by Easy Willis , a jolly black man who supplied two packs of cigarettes a day to each of the three cars patrolling the district around the clock . Easy felt that this would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any time , thus discouragingthe robbers and potential robbers who lived in the area . The packs of cigarettes ensured that not only would the officers walk in once on each watch , but they would make it a point to shine the spotlight in the window every time they passed . In truth , a pack of cigarettes did make them drive by a bit more than they would have normally and a policeman 's spotlight is most reassuring to liquor store and gas station proCalvinPotts and Francis Tanaguchi / 91prietors in the ghetto . Many of whom have faced a gun and been slugged and attacked more than a squad of policemen and in fact have a far more physically dangerous occupation . " Say , Calvin , what 's shakin ? " Easy grinned , as Calvin walked hatless into the store which was stocked wall to wall with beer , hard liquor and cheap wine . The ghetto dwellers were not dilettante drinkers . " Aw right , aw right , Easy , my man , " Calvin said , leaning on the counter while Easy slid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boozy black woman who had a child in her arms and another hanging from her dress . Calvin looked around the store at the sagging liquor countersand the display shelves . Like most ghetto establishments the shelves held no candy bars or cigarettes because of juvenileshoplifting . Calvin glanced at the rows of skin magazines and then at the elaborate sprinkler system which the white owner of the store had installed in case there was ever another black riot in Los Angeles . The proprietor , Lolly Herman , had owned a store in Watts which had been looted and fire-bombed in 1965 . He feared another black rebellion more than any antebellum plantation owner . The proprietor had all windows barred and a silent robbery alarm button situated in five strategic locations in the store : behind the counter , in the restroom in case a thief would force him in there , in the cold storage locker if that should be where he was forced to go , near the back door of the store which led out into the yard that was enclosed by a ten foot chain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top , and finally in the money room which was just to the side of the counter and enclosed by ceiling high sheets of bulletproofglass . The door to the money room was electrically controlledas was the swinging wrought iron gate which protected the front door when the premises were secured at 2:00 A.M.Perhaps more formidable than the lonely vicious Doberman which prowled the service yard at the rear and lay flea bitten in the blazing sunshine was the carbine that Mr. Herman had displayed on the wall inside the bulletproof money room to dissuade any thief who thought his protection was merely preventative. 92 / THE CHOIRBOYSThree weeks after he had finished every elaborate antirobberyand antiburglary device , he was sapped by a ninety pound teenager on roller skates when he was getting into his car after closing . Three thousand dollars were stolen from his socks and underwear . After that , Lolly Herman , with eighteen sutures in his skull , stopped working at the liquor store , retired to his Beverly Hills home and let Easy Willis take over management of the store . Of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six employees could not be made to hustle without Lolly Herman watching them . They stole about a thousand a month among them to supplement their incomes , but the liquor store was still a gold mine and Mrs. Herman secretly thanked God that the ninety pound teenager , called Chipmunk Grimes , had coldcocked the old man and driven him into retirement . " Momma made some souse and head cheese , Calvin , " Easy said when the customer left . Then Easy flipped two packs of Camels on the counter without asking . " Thanks but I do n't eat much soul these days . " Calvin put both packs in his pockets , glad that Francis did n't smoke . Of course Easy knew that Francis did n't smoke but went along with the charade since they first came in the store togetherand Calvin said , " This is my new partner , Easy . His name 's Francis and he smokes Camels just like me .

Sucker 's halfway to Compton by now . " Calvin Potts and Francis Tanaguchi / 93 " He ai n't from Compton . Was n't no brother . He was a paddy long hair blondey like dude . I think he was one a them cats what works at that place down the street where they talks to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makin any money is the one talkin about the jobs , and they get it from the gov ' - ment . " " Yeah , well we 'll take a report , " Calvin said blandly , " and since that job place is closed tonight the detectives 'll check it out tomorrow . " " Oughtta keep the jiveass honkies outta our neighborhoods , " said Easy . " Most a these young jitterbug social workers do n't look like they got all their shit in one bag anyhow . And they be tryin to tell us how to do it . I think most a them is Comminists or some other off brand types . " " Nother thing , " the young man said to Calvin . " The brother what owned the radio is bleedin round the eye . This paddy started talkin some crazy shit when the dude owned the car caught him stealin the radio . Then this honky jist fired on the brother and took the box . " " What he look like when he swung ? " Easy asked . " Baaaaad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Was n't none a them do-gooders then , " said Easy . " They all sissies . Musta been a righteous paddy crook jist passin through . " After penciling out the brief theft report , Francis was fully awake and the moment they drove away from Easy 's liquor store he said , " How about code seven ? " " Too early to eat . " " How about just stopping for a taco at Bennie 's ? " " Aw right . " Calvin lit another cigarette , grimacing at the thought of one of Bennie 's salty guacamole filled drippy tacos which sent Francis Tanaguchi into fits of joy . " Driver of the pimpmobile looks hinky , " Francis said as they crossed Pico Boulevard on La Brea , slowly passing a red and white Cadillac convertible driven by a lanky black man in an orange wide brimmed hat with matching ascot . " Let 's bring him down . Might have a warrant , " Calvin said . " Anything to keep from srnellin those greasy tacos . " The driver pretended not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black and white which followed him for a block until Calvin angrily blasted him to the curb with the siren . " Watch him say who me ? ' " said Calvin as he got out of the car and approached from the driver 's side while Francis advanced on the passenger side , shining his light , distracting the driver to protect his vulnerable partner on the street . " You got a driver 's license ? " Calvin asked , right hand on his gun , three cell light in his left hand , searching for the right hand of the driver which was hidden from view . He relaxed when the driver brought his hand up to the steering wheel and said , " Who me ? " " You know , I once shot a player like you , " Calvin lied . " Dude laid there with two magnums in his belly and when I said , Leroy , you got any last words ? ' he said , Who me ? ' and fell over dead . Now break out somethin with your name on it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ license . " " Sure , Officer , " the man said , stepping out onto the street without being told after Calvin jerked open the door of the Cadillac . Calvin shined his light over the alligators and crab apple green knicker suit with silky orange knee length socks while the man fumbled in the kangaroo wallet nervously . " Here it is , Officer , " he smiled , as Calvin admired the five inch hammered medallion on the bare chest of the young man . Calvin took the slip of paper which was a speeding ticket issued one week earlier by an LAPD motor officer . " This all you got with your name on it ? " Calvin asked . " That was gave me by one of your Po-licemen . It 's official , ai n't it ? " " Shit , " Calvin said . " Fuckin motor cops only care about writina ticket . Bet he took your word about who you are . Bet you keep this ticket for ID until it 's time to go to warrant and then get another ticket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one is in a different name . What 's your real name ? " " Dist like it say there , James Holiday . " " Why you sweatin , James ? " Calvin asked , flashlight in his sap pocket now , both fists on his hips , stretching so that he could be taller than the pimp and look down on him . " You makin me nervous cause you do n't believe rne . " The man licked his lips when they popped dryly . Calvin Potts and Francis Tanaguchi / 95 " Gim me that wallet , " Calvin said suddenly . " Ai n't that illegal search and seizure , Officer ? " asked the pimp . " Gim me that wallet , chump , or it 's gon na be a search and squeez-ure of your fuckin neck ! " " Okay , okay , " the young man said , handing Calvin the wallet . " Looky here , I ai n't no crook or nothin . I owns two or three bars in San Diego . " " Two or three , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Calvin , pulling a bail receipt out of an inner compartment of the wallet . " Uh oh , " said the man . " Uh huh , " said Calvin . " What 's his real name ? " Francis asked , stepping to the open door of the radio car and pulling the hand mike outside to run a make . " Omar Wellington , " Calvin said . " How about savin us a little time , Omar ? You got warrants out or what ? " " Uh-huh , " said Omar Wellington . " Couple traffic warrants . " " Well that ai n't so bad , " said Calvin . " Oh man , I do n't wan na go to jail tonight ! " " No big thing , " Calvin said , touching his handcuffs . " We do n't have to hook you up , do we ? " " Handcuffs ? Naw , I ai n't gon na give nobody no trouble . I 'm nonviolent . How come you stopped me ? It 's them fuckin licenseplates , ai n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and replied , " Did n't even notice em , Omar . " " Then how 'd you tumble ? They 's lots a players around herein Cadillacs . It was my orange hat , was n't it ? You wouldn'teven a saw me if it was n't for that motherfuckin hat . " " Yeah , it was the hat , Omar , " Francis said to pacify thepimp , who like most street people believed superstitiously thatthere was one explainable reason for being singled out . " What do your friends call you , Omar ? " " They jist calls me Omar . " " Okay , Omar , get in the black and white . Let 's get goin so you can bail out tonight . " " 1 only got a hundred bucks on me . The motherfuckin warrantsare for more than that . And a bailbondsman do n't work96 / THE CHOIRBOYSon traffic cases . And I ai n't got no one I can get hold of for four hours . Ai n't this some bullshit ? " " Tell me , Omar , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back seat . " Why do n't you just pay the tickets when you get them ? " " Shee-it ! You do n't give The Man your money till you has to ! " Omar Wellington looked at Francis as though he were a cretin . " Y'unnerstan ? " After booking the pimp Calvin repeated that he was n't hungry . Nothing Francis said seemed to help Calvin out of his depression this night and Francis was constrained to try his last resort . " Calvin , is the periscope still in the trunk ? " he asked innocently . " Now jist a minute , Francis . Jist one fuckin minute ! " " Pull over , Calvin . Lemme just see it . " " Gud-damn you , Francis , you promised . " " Wolfgang 's working alone tonight in a report car . He 's all alone ! " Francis said , trying his inscrutable smile on Calvin Potts . Wolfgang Werner , a twenty-four year old formidable specimenin tailored blue , had been in America from Stuttgart ten years before joining the police department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before Calvin Potts and Francis formed their partnership . Francis did n't mind working with Wolfgang . At first he found Wolfgang hilarious . " If you dundt sign zat traffic ticket we must luck you in ze slummer ! " He only began to hate Wolfgang when the huge German went to Lieutenant Finque and asked to be assigned to another partner because of a personality conflict . Francis thought it reprehensible of the German . It was customaryon the Los Angeles force for police supervisors to leave unquestioned the ambiguous phrase " personality conflict " which masked a plethora of problems . Often it simply meant that two cops hated each other 's guts and would be venting their feelings on the citizens if left together for a protracted period in the incredibly gritty intimate world of the radio car . Francis was furious because too many " personality conflicts " would result in a policeman 's receiving a reputation of " not being able to get along . " Calvin Potts and Francis Tanaguchi / 97The department was still controlled by men who wanted subordinates who could " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good follower makes a good leader . " Francis Tanaguchi never believed in following since there was no one to follow when you were making life and death decisions on the street at night . So Francis said that Wolfgang Werner was a schmuck . He said he knew the real reason that Wolfgang had dumped him . It was because he could n't abide what Harold Bloomguard named them , which was quickly picked up by the other officers . Harold called them The Axis Partners . One night , after Francis had stopped being an Axis Partner and had become half of the Gook and the Spook team , they were cruising Crenshaw Boulevard on a quiet Wednesday when Francis spotted Wolfgang talking with a red haired motoristwhom he had stopped near Rodeo Road ostensibly to write a ticket for a burned out taillight . " Veil , I dundt sink ve neet to write ze ticket zis time , miss , " Wolfgang lisped , standing tall in the street next to the lime Mustang , staring at the driver 's license , memorizing the address , eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulled too far forward a la Roscoe Rules . " Thank you , Officer , " the girl giggled , measuring the massiveshoulders and chest of this young Hercules who dripped with Freudian symbolism . There were the phallic objects : the gun , the badge . Not to mention the oversized sap hanging from the sap pocket . And in Wolfgang 's case ( he was the only nightwatch officer who never got out of his car without it ) there was the nightstick . The obtuse girl had not the slightest understanding of the siege these accouterments lay to her libido . When Wolfgang handed her back the license with a practicedTeutonic grin , Francis knew that Wolfgang would now say , " Vut say ve meedt ufter work for a little chin and tu-nick ? " " That phony krauthead , " Francis complained as he watched the pantomime from his passenger seat in the radio car . Ile ordered Calvin to park near the opposite corner , saying , " I 'm gon na sink that sausage eating Aryan son of a bitch . " Later that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE CHOIRBOYSdiule . Francis knew Wolfgang Werner could not abide an assaulton his dignity . The U-boat attacks began . On the evening of the first attack Wolfgang was working solo taking reports . Francis turned his police hat around backward , scooted down in his seat with Calvin Potts driving and brought his new toy slowly up over the window ledge . " Do you have a mirror in your periscope ? " Calvin asked . " No . " " Then you ca n't see a fuckin thing ? " " No , you got ta tell me when I 'm sighted in on Wolfgang . " " Is that all you 're gon na do , sight in on Wolfgang ? " " No , that ai n't all . We 're gon na sink that pendejo , " Francis replied , lapsing into Spanish . " Bring her alongside . " Wolfgang was stopped on Wilshire Boulevard between Western and Muirfield . This time his quarry was out of the plercedes . She was brunette , leggy , bejeweled and pissed off because she rightly suspected that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out light over her license plate . It was ten o'clock . A starless night . The traffic was light on Wilshire and Francis was afraid Wolfgang would see them cruising in . " Turn out your lights , " Francis commanded . Calvin shrugged and did so , bringing the black and white into the curb behind Wolfgang 's radio car when Francis suddenlysaid , " Not behind them , turkey ! Pull up next to them . And slow . " Then Francis Tanaguchi took a breath and said , " Ssssswwwww000000000000sh , " causing Wolfgang to turn and stare at them quizzically . " A miss ! " Francis said suddenly . " Dive ! Dive ! Dive ! " " What ? " " Get the fuck outta here ! " Francis yelled and Calvin pulled away , leaving Wolfgang and the baffled brunette staring after them in wonder . It took them more than an hour to find Wolfgang Werner the next night they attacked . They finally located him by listening for his calls given by a new radio voice which Calvin suspiciously thought almost as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seven-X-L-Five , see the woman , prowler complaint , Crescent Heights and Colgate . " Calvin Potts and Francis Tanaguchi / 99 " He 'll drop everything to roll on that one , " said Francis . " I know how his mind works . He 'll figure it 's a peeping torn complaint and that she might be good enough to deserve the peeping . All ahead full ! " Francis turned his hat around backward and brought the periscope out from under the seat as they glided toward Wolfgang'scar . The big German was getting out of the car , flashlight in one hand and report notebook in the other . He did n't see them as they cruised closer , their engine cut by Calvin Potts . Then Francis yelled , " Achtung ! Fire one ! Fire two ! " Wolfgang whirled , the flashlight clattered and broke on the asphalt and the German had his clamshell holster open and was halfway into a draw when Francis Tanaguchi said , " Ssssswwwww00000sh . " " Francis , did we get him ? " Calvin asked as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a half of smoking LAPD rubber on the asphalt . " Banzai ! Banzai ! " Francis giggled mysteriously . They did n't see Wolfgang until end-of-watch in the locker room when he came to Francis ' locker before changing and said with a tight grin , " Okay , Francis , you sunk me vunce . Vut say ve meg a truce ? " Francis only smiled inscrutably and left with Calvin to choir practice to brag to Harold Bloomguard that he was driving Wolfgang crackers . He called his U-boat the S.S. Chorizo after the spicy Mexican sausage . The very last time Francis ' boat went to sea was the night he had blood on his hands , when Wolfgang Werner was standing in front of Wilshire Police.Station talking to his newest girlfriend : a big rosy lusty girl named Olga who waited tables at a La Brea drive-in which fed the car in the area for free . " Let it go , baby , " Calvin said as they pulled out of the station parking lot onto Venice Boulevard and Francis Tanaguchi leered at Olga and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Francis said grimly and pulled the periscope from under the seat . " That dude is gon na kick your little ass and I ai n't woofin . " " Go back , Calvin. " 100 / THE CHOIRBOYS " That cat is gon na tear your head off and piss in the hole , Francis . " " You scared of him ? " " You gud-damn right . " " If you take me on one more attack I promise I 'll throw away my periscope . " " Okay , but why now ? " " I 'm in love with Olga . She 's so big ! Go back and I swear I 'll never fire another torpedo . " " You swear ? " " Yes . " " You swear to Buddha ? " " Knock off that Jap stuff , goddamnit . That fuckin Lieutenant Finque made me go to another Nip luncheon today . How 'd you like a shirt full of vomity squid , asshole ? " " Okay , I 'm goin back . But that storm trooper is gon na @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Francis said as Calvin wheeled the radio car around and headed back toward Venice Boulevard . Wolfgang was turned away from them as they drove in from the west , this time in a fast glide and with lights on because of the westbound traffic . " This is the last fuckin time I go to sea , Francis , " Calvin warned . " Okay , okay , now you 're making me nervous , " said the commander , as he sighted in , peeking up over the window ledge because the eyehole of the periscope revealed nothing but a three inch color photograph of a hairy vagina which Calvin had cut from a Playboy magazine and glued inside the plastic tube to amuse Francis . " Steer an evasive course afterward , " Francis ordered as Wolfgang turned from Olga who was dressed in the sheerest tightest hiphugging bellbottoms Francis Tanaguchi had ever seen . She was pantyless and her crotch was dark beneath the sheer yellow bells . Francis leaned out the window , periscope extended , and aimed it not at Wolfgang but at Olga @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tanaguchi and CalvinPotts sped away , fearfully stealing a glance at the grim face of Wolfgang Werner . Calvin Potts and Francis Tanaguchi / 101That night in the locker room Wolfgang grabbed Francis by the throat without warning and said , " If you efen tink of puttingyour lousy torpedo vere you pudt it tonight , I vill tvist you neg off . You vood be smart to decommission your U-boat , Francis . Wolfgang made Francis promise by squeezing and encouraginghim to bob his head . Then he left Francis gasping in front of the locker while Calvin Potts pretended to need another trip to the urinal , away from Wolfgang Werner . When Calvin returned he said , " I think we better put the S.S. Chorizo in dry dock for good , Francis . " That last dangerous attack on the German came after the call which would awaken Francis sweating in the night with red in the crevices of his knuckles and under his nails . " Seven-A-Seventy-seven , see the woman , unknown trouble , Pico and Ogden . " " Seven-A-Seventy-seven , roger , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Damn it , I 'm drooling for a guacamole taco ! " " This must be it , " Calvin said five minutes later and Francis looked up as Calvin hit the high beam , lighting a man and woman who stood in front of a seedy apartment house which was still located in a predominately white neighborhood , but which was experiencing a high vacancy factor because blacks were getting more numerous . " Hope this is a quickie , " Francis said as they gathered up their flashlights , hats and notebook . The smog hung over the streets and the building like airbrushed , painted smoke . " I 'm the one that called , " said a woman in a quilted bathrobe , her orange hair frizzing beneath a hairnet . A balding man with a sloppy grin sat on the steps beside her . There were six empty beer cans between them . " What 's the problem ? " Francis asked , slightly uneasy over an " unknown trouble " call , which can mean anything but sometimes means only that the communications @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convenient category in which to classify it . " I 'm the manager , " said the woman , bunching the robe at the bosom as though she were not twenty years past the age when most policemen would look . " I got a tenant up there in102 / THE CHOIRBOYSnumber twelve . Name 's Mrs. Stafford . She got three little kids and I should n't oughtta have rented to her cause we do n't want no more than one kid per apartment . " " So what happened ? " Calvin asked impatiently , wondering if Francis would object too strongly if he were to stop by McGoon 's Saloon and have a little taste . Just maybe one little Johnnie Walker on the rocks .. . " Well , see do n't you think it 's unusual ? I hear this noise about two hours ago just when it was getting dark . Then I do n't hear nothing . They go to bed awful early , her and her kids . I feel so sorry for them I loaned them an old TV . She just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or nothing yet so she 's trying to find work as a waitress . But it 's hard . " " The noise , " Calvin said . " The noise . " " Yeah , so then I thought I heard screaming . Not too loud , but a scream . But kids always holler . And then , then about twenty minutes ago I see a man go out and then nothing . There ai n't no lights on in there . Just nothing . I went up and knocked but nothing . " " So ? " " They 're home . They did n't go out . I woulda saw them if they went out . " " So they 're asleep . " " The TV 's on . " " They just forgot ... " " Look sir , " the woman said , turning to Francis , " it 's an old TV but it works good . I can hear the station . It 's the same channel as I 'm watching . And I peek in through the drapes and I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You ca n't hardly make out the picture . " " What 's that mean ? " " I do n't know , sir . " The woman turned to Calvin again . " She do n't have many friends . Poor little woman stays with her kids all day and all night . Just trying to find work is only time she leaves them and then I keep an eye on them . " " Why do n't you use your passkey and go on in ? " " That 's the problem , I ai n't got one . Last tenant did n't turn his in and I gave her my passkey . Can you just go in and see if everything 's all right ? " Calvin Potts and Francis Tanaguchi / 103 " Do n't suppose you want us to break the door down ? " Calvinmuttered as the two policemen started up the steps . " Ca n't you just slip the lock like all the cops in the movies ? " " No , and I ca n't open a safe by listenin to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the landing first and knocked loudly on the door of number twelve . " I do n't want you to break the door . " The landlady stood at the foot of the stairs helplessly . Francis began fiddling with the sliding window beside the front door and said , " Hold this , " to Calvin , giving his tall partnerthe notebook . Then he pushed hard on the window with the tips of the fingers of one hand while he pried at the frame with a coin from his pocket . There was a metallic snap and the window slid to the left . " Oughtta be a burglar , Francis , " Calvin observed . " Too respectable . I 'd rather be a cop . " Francis pushed back the faded draperies and lifted himself up and into the dark r room , lit only from the snow filled screen of the TV set whose volume was barely audible . " Calvin ! " Francis suddenly whispered . " What is it ? " His partner instinctively grabbed his gun and stepped to the side of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this time , and Calvin Potts dropped the notebook , convinced that his partner was in danger . Calvin crouched , looked for cover , considered the distance to the steps . " Calvin ! " Francis said again , and Calvin Potts drew his gun while the landlady below shrieked and ran to her apartment to escape a gun battle . The door opened slowly and Calvin flattened himself against the wall , adrenalin jetting . Francis stepped woodenly across the threshold . " Calvin ! " he said as softly as a child . " What is it ? What the fuck is it ? " Calvin demanded , his gun pointed directly at Francis who did not seem to notice . " There 's some people murdered in there ! " " Gud-damn it , Francis ! " Calvin pushed his partner aside and entered the apartment , gun still drawn , flashlight sweeping the room until he found the light switch. 104 / THE CHOIRBOYSThe first one Calvin saw was the woman . She was unbelievablythin and pale with huge eye sockets . She lay on the couch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her legs were spread , knees up , head thrown back in agony . The classic pose of a victim raped and murdered . The TV antenna wire was knotted around her neck and her eyes and mouth were open . The dead eyes , still clear and unclouded , stared at the top of the doorway which led to the two bedrooms . Hanging from the doorway was a blonde baby doll . The doll wore a red party dress trimmed in white . The dress had been washed many times and the painted face of the doll was chipped and worn . The doll was hanging by the neck , dangling from the doorjamb by a bathrobe sash which was taped to the jamb with adhesive tape . The tape roll was on the floor in the doorway to the bathroom . As Calvin made a mental note to put the tape roll aside for prints , Francis startled him by walking up behind him and saying , " The kitchen ! " Calvin took two steps to his left into a tiny kitchen with a small yellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sink lay a sandy haired boy of seven . The telephone cord was spiraled around his neck and his face rested on a pillow as though the killer wanted him comfortable . The green velvet pillow was wet from the fluids which ran from the child 's mouth while he was strangling . His pajama top was pulled up and there were two cigarette burns on his back and another on his neck . His eyes were closed , more tightly than Calvin had ever before seen in death . As though he had died crying hopelesslyfor his mother , his face pressed into the velvet pillow . " The bathroom ! " Francis said and Calvin nodded mechanicallyand followed his partner across the little room , pausing to look at the baby doll hanging in the doorway . It turned gently as Francis ' hat touched the fat rubber foot when he passed . Francis looked in the bathroom to verify what he had alreadyseen before he opened the door for his partner . Then he looked at the pink baby doll and back to Calvin . Calvin Potts knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his heart was banging in his ears when FrancisCalvin Potts and Francis Tanaguchi l 105switched on the light and stepped aside to let his partner see the child dangling from the bar over the shower stall . She was the youngest , four , clad in animal cracker pajamas . She was hanging by two pair of panty hose knotted together . The coroner was to say later it probably took her longest to die . Calvin did not want to see if she had been burned . He did not want to touch her . Her eyes were open like her mother 's . Her mouth was closed because the head hung forward on her chest . She turned slowly when Francis touched her foot . " What the fuck you doin ? " " Huh ? " Francis said dumbly . " Keep your hands off them ! " " Huh ? " Francis said , not knowing he had reached out and consolingly patted the tiny feet which were strapped together at the ankles with a brown belt and were pointed toes downwardlike a ballerina 's . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right now ! " Calvin wiped his dripping forehead with the back of hishand . " Wait a minute ! How many kids she say there was ? " " I 'm not sure . " " Three , was n't it ? " " Yeah , it was three , " Francis said , sounding very sick . " The bedrooms ! " Calvin switched on the light in the main bedroom which contained a double bed where the woman slept with the youngest child . He was breathing heavily as he looked in the closet and behind a box of old toys . " Calvin ! " Francis said from the other bedroom where there were twin beds and colorful plastic gimcracks on an old dresser and a painted Formica shelf covered with pictures of daisies , apparently to make the dreary bedroom look as though a child slept there . Francis was on his knees between the beds , his hat and flashlight on the floor beside him , the beam shining under the bed lighting the body of the five year old boy . Calvin dropped to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flashlight , looked under . The bundle was drenched in blood , the pajamas shredded around the tiny huddled body unrecognizable as a child except for some short blond hair not blood soaked. 106 / THE CHOIRBOYS " Musta crawled under there to get away from him , " Calvin said hoarsely . " The killer musta crawled after him and cut the kid up there under the bed . Just laid there under that bed slashin and slashin . Musta been that way . It 's clean all around the outside a the bed . The little thing hidin under the bed and the killer crawlin under after him with the knife . There ai n't no God , Francis ! I swear there ai n't ! " Then Francis was on his feet , throwing the bed aside and pulling at the little form , dragging it through the viscous red puddle until Calvin stopped him . " Do n't touch that body ! " " I think I saw him move , Calvin ! I think maybe he 's still alive ! " " Francis ! " Calvin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thudded softly to the floor , splashing heavy drops onto the dirty wallpaper . " His insides are all over the fuckin floor ! Look ! " And he pointed at the ominous red blossoms . " Look at the blood ! Look at the face ! That child 's dead , Francis . " Francis Tanaguchi looked at his partner for a moment , looked at his own bloody hands , then said , " Oh . I ca n't see too good without my glasses . I guess I should wear my glasses . " " Let 's go call the dicks , " Calvin said , gently leading his partnerout of the apartment which in thirty minutes was swarmingwith detectives , fingerprint specialists , photographers , deputy coroners and high ranking police administrators who had nothing to do with the investigation but who were always the ones who acted as spokesmen on the television news . Deputy Chief Lynch was there , his hairpiece a little askew because he had just been in a motel with Theda Gunther . Commander Moss was there , waving and grinning until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He pretended that he was examining a lift of a latent fingerprint found on the side of the television set . He held the lift upside down as he scrutinized it . Then he waved with both arms at the newsmen as he was leaving , his blond wavy hair glowing under the lights . One journalist said he acted like a Rose Queen on a flower float . There were few clues left by the killer . The latent print was found to have belonged to the victim , Mrs. Mary Stafford . An old boyfriend of hers was ultimately arrested for the murdersCalvin Potts and Francis Tanaguchi / 107but the evidence was not sufficient for a complaint . CommanderMoss ' picture never appeared in the newspapers . It was later that night , with a child 's blood still lodged in the creases of his fingers , that Francis Tanaguchi raised a plastic periscope and began that last obsessive U-boat attack on WolfgangWerner and big Olga . Then he called for a choir practice and drank and worried about the nightmares sure to come. 87-A-1 : Spermwhale Whalenand Baxter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a smoggy June afternoon , just two months before the choir practice killing . Spermwhale was not over the death of a son who claimed to despise him as much as he loved the son . Actually , they hardly knew each other . Baxter Slate , his partner , was never a boisterous young man so it was not unusual that he said very little while half the nightwatch hooted and jeered at Roscoe Rules and Lieutenant Finque . " Damn it , Lieutenant , I resent the investigators showing my picture all the time to rape victims , " Roscoe Rules complained . " I did n't know they were doing it till last month . " " Apparently they just noticed that your picture mixes well with white sex suspects , " Lieutenant Finque replied , getting a migraine as he always did at rollcall these days . " Yeah , well I shoulda got suspicious when that pussy kiddy cop caught me in civvies and asked to let her snap a Polaroid a me to test out the new camera . " " No harm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That cunt 's been using my picture in a mug shot showup every fucking time a paddy rapes somebody around here ! " Spermwhale Whalen and Baxter Slate / 109 " She ca n't help it you look like such a deviate , " Spermwhale said , as his partner Baxter Slate grinned . " I think she 'll stop , Roscoe , by the time two or three victims pick you out of the lineup . " " They 'd probably have the right guy , " said Harold Bloomguard . " Naw , he ca n't even get a blue veiner , let alone a diamond cutter , " said Calvin Potts . " We ever get a limp dick bandit around here he 'll be a prime suspect . " " Very funny , Potts , very fucking funny , " Roscoe Rules said murderously as he unconsciously pulled on his limp dick . " Well , I 'll see what I can do , Rules , " the lieutenant said . " Now onto the next subject of our supervisors ' meeting . That is : excessive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of paper work to do because an officer on the morning watch broke a suspect 's arm with a wristlock . Just be careful in the future . Remember , a wristlock is very hard to put on if a man resists , so do n't get carried away . " " Question , Lieutenant , " Baxter Slate said . " Yes ? " " If a man did n't resist , why would you ever put it on in the first place ? " Sergeant Yanov saved his superior officer by taking control of the rollcall and saying , " How about my reading the crimes . Here 's a sex story . Might perk up your evening . " And as Sergeant Yanov rescued his lieutenant from further embarrassing faux pas , Lieutenant Finque smoldered . Yanov related so easily with the men , was so obviously well liked , that Finque knew he had to be a rotten supervisor . This belief was bolstered in that Yanov had been working for him three months and had never yet been capable of catching a policemanwith his hat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a note to mention to Captain Drobeck that Yanov , at thirty-four , just a few months younger than LieutenantFinque , was probably too young and inexperienced to be an effective field sergeant and should be encouraged to go into the detective bureau . Captain Drobeck would be the first to agree with such a proposal because he had hated Yanov ever since the sergeant openly disagreed with the captain at a meeting of all the Wil-110 / THE CHOIRBOYSshire Division supervisors . Yanov refuted an " administrative suggestion " from the captain and argued that he would willinglyfool the chief of police and lie to the mayor , and to his own wife if he still had one , but never to his men . Because he never asked his chief , mayor or wife to fight for him or save his ass . Captain Drobeck wrote on Sergeant Yanov 's rating report : " Is yet too young and immature to grasp the fundamentals of supervision . " To get even with the troops Lieutenant Finque interrupted Sergeant Yanov 's reading of the noteworthy crimes . LieutenantFinque decided to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rollcall : that a Superior Court jury had acquitted a man charged with the murder of a Los Angeles police officer . " Acquitted ? " thundered Spermwhale Whalen when the lieutenant announced it , but even Spermwhale 's bellow was lost in the deafening clamor which went up in that room . The accused was thought to be a narcotic dealer . He went to a hotel with an undercover officer who posed as a buyer , and a third man , a police informant . The officer was prepared to make a large buy but as it turned out the accused had no drugs . He did have a small caliber pistol with which he shot and killed the officer who returned fire ineffectively before his death . The accused stole the suitcase full of money and ran out the door but was arrested immediately by other officers hiding outside . The police called the shooting a straight ripoff operation in which the plan was to steal the money . The informant testified that the defendant grabbed the suitcase and fired without warning . The defendant 's testimony was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defendant , thinking he was to be ripped off , fired first to protect himself . The investigatingofficers scoffed . They said it was a " dead bang " case . A cinch . The evidence was overwhelming . There was an eyewitness . The defendant 's story was desperate and ludicrous . He was acquitted . The judge , upon hearing the verdict , proclaimed that he was shocked . But he was not nearly as shocked as the twenty-eight men in Lieutenant Finque 's rollcall who would never becomeSpermwhale Whalen and Baxter Slate / 111accustomed to shocking jury verdicts . It took five minutes to quiet them down and get several questions answered . But they were n't questions . They were statements of indignation and disbelief . Outcries . Then threats . Then a violent obscene damning of the jury system . Baxter Slate , perhaps the most articulate choirboy , said grimly that this bulwark of democracy was actually a crap game in which twelve telephone operators , mailmen , public utilities employees , pensioners and middle aged housewives , with no knowledge of the law and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their exposure to movies like Twelve Angry Men and television shows like Perry Mason . Lieutenant Finque let them rail until he was sure their stomachswere as sour as his always was because of them . He beamed contentedly . He was n't even afraid of them at the moment . Their outrage was so complete that they quickly talked themselves out . One moment shrill trembling voices . Questionsunanswered and unanswerable . Then silence . Defeat . Depression . And smoldering fury . Lieutenant Finque sent them out to do police work with one further blandishment : " You men take with you the captain 's last warning from the supervisors ' meeting . Any wetfoot hotdogswho like to put a shoe in the carburetor better stand by . The next preventable traffic accident is going to mean the commander comes down on the captain , who 's going to come down hard on me and I 'm going to have to come down hard on you ! " Finally Spermwhale Whalen spoke . He said , " I know shit rolls downhill . But why am I always livin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ despised the new station Wilshire Division had moved to in early 1974 . Daily he would drive by the dilapidated , inadequate old building on Pico Boulevard which , by God , looked like a police station . He longed for the old days . Spermwhale , at 260 pounds with the pig eyes of a whale , was aptly named . He was of Irish Catholic stock , divorced three times , considering himself thus excommunicated . " It 's just too112 / THE CHOIRBOYSbad I ai n't rich enough to 've got a fancy annulment approved by the Pope like all these rich cunts and cocksuckers you read about . Then I coulda stayed in the church . " It was a refrain often heard at MacArthur Park choir practicewhen Spermwhale was almost in the tank , a fifth of bourbonor Scotch in the huge red hand . " Now I got ta go to hell cause I 'm excommunicated ! " And if Father Willie Wright was drunk enough and suffering from his frequent attacks of overwhelming guilt for having just dismounted Ora Lee Tingle or Carolina Moon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dispassionately twice a month , he would say softly , " I 'll be with you , Spermwhale . I 'm afraid I 'll be with you ! " Baxter Slate was a good partner for Spermwhale Whalen because he did n't talk too much and give Spermwhale a headache . Also he had almost five years on the job , having been sworn in on his twenty-second birthday . Spermwhale , a nineteenyear veteran , considered anyone with less time a fuzz nutted rookie and could n't stand to work with rookie partners . Also Baxter did n't complain when Spermwhale would occasionallypick up a streetwalking prostitute whom Spermwhale knew from his old days on the vice squad , saying , " It 's time for a little skull . " Were he to be caught it would mean their jobs , and Spermwhale Whalen was just months away from a pension . It was a calculated risk and Spermwhale sweated it out each time because the LAPD brass definitely did not approve of uniformed officers in black and whites getting a little skull . It was surprising that Spermwhale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sergeant who caught him doing something for which he could be fired would never get back to the station alive , because he , Spermwhale Whalen , would kill any cocksuckerwho tried to keep him from making his twenty years and getting that irretrievable pension . Anyone Spermwhale did n't like was either a " cunt , " a " gelding , " a " eunuch , " or a " cocksucker , " and that included almost all civilians , certainly all police brass and station supervisors ( except Sergeant Nick Yanov ) and all employees of the Civil Service Department who had designed nitpicking promotional exams which had frustratedhim all these years and kept him from advancing past the basic policeman rank . Spermwhale Whalen and Baxter Slate l 113It was especially galling in that Spermwhale Whalen was a major in the Air Force Reserve and often ran into LAPD lieutenantsand captains , also military reservists , who , during summermilitary exercises , had to salute him . Spermwhale was proof positive that polish was not necessary to achieve staff rank in the United States Air Force Reserve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense was not needed to achieve staff rank in the Los Angeles Police Department . But Spermwhale Whalen was just possibly one of the coolest most competent transport pilots in the 452nd Wing . He had flown in World War II and later in Korea until he left the Air Force and joined the police department . He was the only Los Angeles police officer in history to engage in one of his country'swars while still an active member of the department . His remarkable feat was accomplished by flying C-124 Globemasterson three and four day missions from March Air Force Base to Danang in 1966 and 1967 , almost being shot down twice by Communist surface to air missiles . Spermwhale was , for this reason , a minor legend in the department . In those years it had been fun for the Wilshire policemen to play straight man for Spermwhale among police officers from other stations , saying things like : " Oh , Marvin , where 'd you go on your days off ? " " Disneyland with my sister 's kids , how about you ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bear Lake , and how about you , Spermwhale ? " " Danang . Was n't much happenin . Few rocket attacks is all . " Spermwhale seldom took two days off a week in those years . Like many policemen , he preferred to work nine and ten days straight to string his days off together . But his were for combat missions for which he was paid a bonus by the government of the United States to give to his three wives , each of whom had borne him a child before the divorce . When Spermwhale was off flying and the nightwatch sat bored in the assembly room , someone would always say when a low-flying aircraft roared over making an approach to LA International : " Well , sounds like Spermwhale 's late for rollcall again . " Spermwhale bore a Z-shaped scar which began in the fur of one black tufted eyebrow , crossed the flattened bridge of his114 / THE CHOIRBOYSnose , swooped under his right eye and came back onto the nose showing white in the swatch of red veins . Once at choir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scar . " Landin in the rain with half my tail shot away . " " Where , Spermy ? Where 'd it happen ? " An extraordinary thing happened : Spermwhale could not remember . Not for almost a full minute . The alcohol had temporarilydebilitated his brain but it was more than that . He had flown so many missions for his government in which he had been asked to kill or cause the deaths of Oriental people that they had started to run together : Japanese , Korean , Vietnamese . He truly could n't answer . Not immediately . " Oh yeah , " he said finally . " Korea . Jesus Christ ! Korea . Jesus Christ ! I could n't remember which war ! " After the Vietnam War ended , Spermwhale still flew but of course lost a good deal of his military pay and had a difficult time paying off the three wives and keeping enough to drink and take out a broad when he got lucky . It was for economic reasons more than anything else that he became a faithful choirboy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a headache . At choir practice there was always free booze supplied by Roscoe Rules and Spencer Van Moot . And there was sometimes Carolina Moon whom Spermwhale fell in love with at every single choir practice . The fat girl and the fat policeman would go off hand in hand for a stagger around the duck pond , sucking at a bottle of Scotch and cooing like doves . The other choirboys called them the campus couple . Both Spermwhale Whalen and Baxter Slate were in a foul mood after rollcall . What had them generally pissed off was that they were both just now feeling the loss of pay from a four days ' suspension . The suspension had resulted from Lieutenant Elliott " Hardass " Grimsley 's deciding to celebrate his fortieth birthday by going out in the field for the evening and showing the station commander , Captain Drobeck , that he could be as big a prick as Captain Drobeck any old day , and that even though he had only been a lieutenant eight months , his nine years as a fieldSpermwhale Whalen and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at being a prick . Captain Drobeck on the other hand had recently tried to demonstrate he was not a prick but a prince , during a formal inspection conducted by Deputy Chief Lynch himself . Every patrol officer in Wilshire Station wore tintless blue , and polishedblack leather for that inspection . They were formed into three sweating platoons . Captain Drobeck , with his plumy white mane freshly done , was resplendent in his blues , wearing all the campaign ribbons he earned in Patton 's Third Army . The Wilshire policemen knew that he had only been a clerk typist in that army and not a tank commander as he hinted and they often whispered that Captain Drobeck never retreated but backspaced lots of times . Deputy Chief Lynch always showed up for ceremonies after a twenty minute wait , just as he answered the phone after a three minute wait . Captain Drobeck fussed nervously with his trouser creases and hoped his shoes were spit shined well enough by his adjutant , Sergeant Sneed , who learned such things while a trombone player in the U.S. Army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife of Lieutenant Elliott " Hardass " Grimsley . She stood on the sidewalk by the parking lot where a dozen other spectators waited with cameras . During one of the anxious moments , Lieutenant Grimsley nodded and winked at his wife of twenty years who wore a hat , gloves and , incredibly enough , a corsage for the occasion . ArdellaGrimsley beamed and blew her husband a sweeping kiss which was answered by a horrendous fart in the rear ranks and a voice saying , " And here 's a kiss for you ! " " WHO DID THAT ? " Lieutenant Grimsley screamed , almost literally scaring the crap out of the already nervous Captain Drobeck . " What the hell 's going on , Grimsley ? " demanded the captain . " Somebody farted ! " " Is that so terrible ? " " At my wife ! " " I do n't understand you , Grimsley . " Just then , Sergeant Sneed , called Suckass Sneed by the men , L16 / THE CHOIRBOYSgame running forward from his place at the rear of the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sir , " he whispered breath-.essly to the captain . " I mean a black voice . " " If I may , " said Officer Baxter Slate , who stood in the front rank , " a voice may have timbre , resonance , even pitch but it is singularly without color . " He said it with a wide easy grin at Captain Drobeck which Lieutenant Grimsley knew was phony but which was so well done it was impossible to accuse him of insubordination . Captain Drobeck , sure of the affection of his men , smiled benevolently and said , " Please , gentlemen , let 's calm ourselves . This is perfectly silly . " " It 's not silly , Captain . Somebody insulted my wife , " LieutenantGrimsley answered . " Please , Lieutenant , please ! " Captain Drobeck whispered . " The deputy chief is going to be here any minute and you 're acting like a child . My god , I ca n't believe this . " " It was personal , sir . It was vicious ! " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an apology ? It was undoubtedly some young policeman 's idea of a joke . Christ , most of these men here are closer to twenty than thirty . They 're kids ! I 'll have the boy apologize and we can forget it . " Captain Drobeck turned to the platoon of men and showed his toothy paternal grin and said , " Okay , fellas . Let 's fess up . Who farted ? " And he laughed uproariously with the men as he waited for the culprit to reply so he could show the men how silly Hardass Grimsley was and how magnanimously he could forgive the insult to Ardella Grimsley who was one of those garrulous bitches Captain Drobeck could n't stand in the first place . But a funny thing happened : nobody fessed up . " Come on now , boys , " Captain Drobeck laughed , but the laughter was a little strained . " Just cop out whoever you are . Tell Lieutenant Grimsley it was an accident and it 's all forgot-ten . " And the laughter continued but was not joined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waited for the guilty party to show Lieutenant Grimsley how he , Captain Drobeck , could relate with his men . Spermwhale Whalen and Baxter Slate / 117Still , nobody fessed up . " I just ca n't understand this , " Captain Drobeck said . " I 've given you every opportunity to show some maturity here and I think Lieutenant Grimsley deserves it . Now , by God , I 'd like the young man to just apologize to the lieutenant and it 'll all be forgotten . But we ca n't wait all day and I expect it to be done immediately . " But nobody copped out . Captain Drobeck was suddenly not laughing nor was he smiling . He was fidgeting with the crease in his uniform pants and nodding angrily . " All right , that 's the way it 's going to be , huh ? By god , you wan na act like kids I can treat you like kids . You want the field sergeants to start coming down on you , huh ? Well that can be arranged , I assure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man that farted is n't man enough to admit it I want the man next to him to do it . " And the man next to him obediently did it . His fart was louder than the first . " ATTEN-HUT ! " screamed Captain Drobeck and the platoon snapped to attention . The captain began pacing the rear ranks like a lion , muttering viciously as he looked each man in the eye and tried to apply some detective techniques he had learned from reading books on investigation when he studied for the captain 's exam . He looked for nervous twitches , telltale blinking . The trouble was he was so nervous waiting for Deputy Chief Lynch and now so angry himself that his own eyes were winking like semaphores . After he paced the entire platoon he strode angrily to the front and whispered to Suckass Sneed , " You find out who did it , hear me ? " " Yes sir . The first or the second fart ? " " I want that man ! The first one ! " " It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm sure of it , " said Sneed . " That narrows it down to six . " Just then Deputy Chief Lynch 's car arrived . The incident was set aside temporarily . The inspection was conducted and it was a great success . Captain Drobeck thanked the chief for his gracious compliments and assured him the credit was due to the loyalty of the men . Thirty minutes after the inspection , Captain Drobeck was in118 / THE CHOIRBOYSa cubicle in the restroom relieving his rumbling bowels from the tension of the day . He had the morning paper there and was grunting happily and smoking his pipe . Suddenly the door to the restroom burst open and someone released a terrible , vengeful fart . Before the footsteps ran back out a voice said , " Take that , you jive turkey ! " Captain Drobeck never solved the mystery . But one thing was certain : it was a colored voice . On one of his weekly evenings out on the streets , Lieutenant Grimsley caught eight officers with their hats off , one smoking in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been gratuitously received . Just before calling it a night , he added to his score by bagging Spermwhale Whalen and Baxter Slate staked out on a stop sign at 11:00 P.M. on a residentialstreet where a car did n't pass more often than once every half hour . Both officers were slumped in their seats , heads resting against the windows . But like any veteran policemen , they could rely on years of experience to trigger signals in deep slumber when 7-A-1 was mentioned among the ceaseless garbled almost unintelligible radio messages . Legally speaking , Lieutenant Hardass Grimsley was a strict constructionist . He could not prove his suspicions that Spermwhaleand Baxter were asleep , so their suspension papers said : Officers failed to remain alert in that officers assumed a position of repose in a parked police vehicle with eyelids pressed together , breathing heavily and regularly . Four days . In addition , through diligent police work , Lieutenant Grimsleyfound a bag of avocados in the trunk of the black and white , which he traced to Francis Tanaguchi , who , it turned out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owner was proud of Francis ' being a Japanese policeman , not knowing that Francis was Mexican at heart and would use the avocados in making guacamole which he would ladle into his tacos . Spermwhale and Baxter were given an additional punishment of a divisional admonishment which read : Spermwhale Whalen and Baxter Slate / 119I hereby admonish you in that you accepted some avocados from another officer who received them from a private party who was not , in fact , morally correct in giving the avocados without recompense . Moreover , the other officer was guilty of moral turpitude for accepting the free avocados . The acceptanceof gratuities is against Department regulations and you were aware of this regulation at the time you imprudently accepted the avocados from the officer who was also aware when he imprudently accepted the avocados from the man who should have been more prudent . Francis Tanaguchi was not given an admonishment or any other penalty because the community relations officer , LieutenantGay , was trying to make public relations inroads with the Oriental community by putting Officer Tanaguchi up as a model policeman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reprimand Francis officially . Lieutenant Grimsley acceded to the decision since it came from the stationcaptain but he was frustrated because there was n't somethinghe could get on the old Japanese who gave Francis the avocados . He asked the vice squad to keep an eye on the market in case the old man should sell beer to minors . And he certainly put Lieutenant Gay and Francis on his list . But if Lieutenant Gay , Francis Tanaguchi and the old Japanesewere on Lieutenant Grimsley 's list , Lieutenant Grimsley was certainly on Spermwhale Whalen 's list . " His dance card 's all filled up , " Spermwhale vowed at choir practice when the whole night had been spent on plotting revenge . " I get the first waltz , " said Francis Tanaguchi , who sat in the dark on a blanket under a tree . The choirboys began various subtle attacks on Lieutenant Grimsley which ultimately ended up in his transfer from WilshireStation because according to the station captain he was getting too chummy with certain officers . The officers he was apparently getting so chummy with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whalen and Baxter Slate , who when they were finished with him could actually walk into Lieutenant Grimsley 's office and120 / THE CHOIRBOYSmuss up his lint covered , thinning hair and say things like , " How about a day off tomorrow , Hardass ? " When no one else under the rank of lieutenant ever dared to address him even by his first name , Elliott . This remarkable familiarity was accomplished by some groundwork supplied by Francis Tanaguchi which included shimming the door of the lieutenant 's private car and putting three MacArthur ducks in the back seat . It was entertaining for the choirboys to stake out the police parking lot after end-of-watch and see Lieutenant Grimsley trudge through the dark , sleepy after a hard night of paper work , and get into his car only to come flying out five seconds later and fall on his ass from the duck excrement on his shoes . It was said that his wife nagged him for months about the green slime she would find stubbornly clinging to the creases of the leather upholstery . The choirboys also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ locker at the station which resulted in an investigation by officers of Internal Affairs Division which lasted a week . Harold Bloomguard , the protector of ducks and all animals , in each case volunteered to take the hissing , squawking birds and get rid of them after the duck shit hit the fan . This should have made him a logical suspect since he mysteriously showed up after each duck attack but Lieutenant Grimsley was too outraged to put two and two together . Besides , it was extremelyhard to add two and two when your personal belongingswere dripping and foul smelling and an enraged loathsomecreature had been banging on your head with its bill . There were minor attacks wherein the siren on the Lieutenant'spolice car was fixed so that it wailed and could not be shut off when he started the engine . And his baton , which he kept in the door holder , was removed , carefully sawed in half and replaced . But the coup which utterly demolished Lieutenant Grimsleyand made him a slave to Spermwhale Whalen and precipitatedhis transfer occurred when Spermwhale bribed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curvy and slenderdespite her years , to entertain Lieutenant Grimsley . Spermwhale Whalen told her in which restaurant the lieutenSpermwhaleWhalen and Baxter Slate / 121ant ate on Thursday nights when he could break away from his duties which consisted of signing routine reports and trying to catch policemen loafing in the station when they should be handling their calls . It took Fanny Forbes , who posed as a tourist from Philadelphia , exactly twenty-five minutes to talk Lieutenant Grimsley into driving her and her bogus suitcase , containing the dirty laundry of Spermwhale Whalen , to a motel on La Brea . He parked his black and white on a side street and insisted on carrying her bag up the back stairs while she registered alone . Eight minutes after she registered , and while Lieutenant Grimsley , naked except for his black police socks , was hotly kissing the well worn source of her income and whispering endearments like , " Oh baby , you do n't seem like a Negro . You look like a Samoan ! " Spermwhale Whalen and Baxter Slate crept up the same back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unlocked . The two choirboys waited a few minutes more , their ears to the door , and heard Lieutenant Grimsley panting so loudly they were afraid they 'd miss the prearranged signal from Fanny Forbes . " She 's really got him sucking wind . " " Yeah ! " Spermwhale whispered , his hat in hand , ear pressed to the door , waiting , waiting . And then they heard it , the signal : " Oh honey ! " cried the whore . " You got balls like a elephant and a whang like a ox ! " Just as Spermwhale burst through the door Lieutenant Grimsley was in the throes of blissful agony . When he withdrewand jumped from the bed his face was like a dead man 's . " Okay , who called the pol . . . Lieutenant Grimsley ! " cried Spermwhale Whalen . " What 're you men doing here ? " cried Lieutenant Grimsley . " We got a call a woman was being raped in this room ! We had no idea ! " cried Baxter Slate . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the young lady ! " cried Spermwhale Whalen . " How humiliatin ! " cried the whore . " Let 's keep our voices down , " whispered Lieutenant Grimsley , still motionless and pale. 122 / THE CHOIRBOYS " Sir , there 's some dew on the lily , " offered Spermwhale Whalen . " Oh , " said Lieutenant Grimsley , coming to his senses and wiping his whang with his jockey shorts while Fanny Forbes lay nude on the bed and winked at Spermwhale Whalen who was possibly enjoying the sweetest moment of his life . " Well , we better be goin . . . Hardass , " Spermwhale grinned , as Lieutenant Grimsley toppled clumsily over on the bed trying to get his pants on two legs at a time . " Yes , well , meet me at Pop 's coffee shop , will you , fellas ? I 'd like to buy you a cup of coffee and talk over a few things before we go back in . " " Sure . . . Hardass , " Spermwhale grinned , playfully mussing up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when , three weeks later , Captain Drobeck suggested that he was getting too chummy with certain officers and perhaps should think about a transfer . Lieutenant Grimsley was glad because he was sick and tired of Spermwhale Whalen sitting on his desk and winkingand mussing up his hair every time he came in to have a report approved . Fanny Forbes complained when Spermwhale only slipped her a ten dollar bill , but when he reminded her that it was ten bucks more than she had gotten for similar activity with himself , she shrugged and accepted the stipend . But on the night they caught the Regretful Rapist , both Spermwhale and Baxter were still mightily pissed off from receiving the four days ' suspension for sleeping with the avocados . Lieutenant Grimsley had by then been transferred to Internal Affairs Division where he could catch lots of errant policemen . The arrest of the Regretful Rapist was possibly the best pinch Baxter Slate had ever made . The rapist had sexually attacked more than thirty women at knifepoint on the streets of Los Angeles and got his name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women cab fare when the attack was finished . The rapist had been fortunate in that not one of his victims had violently resisted and it was unknownhow far he would have gone with his eight inch dagger if he had met a real fighter . Nevertheless , he was rightly conSpermwhale Whalen and Baxter Slate / 123sidered an extremely dangerous man , not only to the female citizens he preyed upon , but to any potential arresting officer . The night they caught the rapist had been a fairly uneventfulnight . The first call of the evening was to warn a resident of a twenty-three room house in Hancock Park that he should not go outside to swat flies in the afternoon , particularly when he had to climb a ladder to get them , and especially when his next door neighbor 's daughter , a nineteen year old blonde , just happened to be washing her Mercedes 450 SL and could n't help seeing that he was stark naked beneath his bathrobe , which kept flapping open . The second call of the evening had been to take a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been closed for three days . They heard the burglary victim'sopinion which Spermwhale had heard perhaps a times in his police career : " It must 've been kids who did it , " said the victim , since burglary victims of both residential and commercial burglaries hate to consider the prospect of a grown man viciously and dangerously violating the sanctity of their premises by his presence . If there is nothing taken , or if property of any value whatsoever is left behind , the victims invariably allay their fear of prowling deadly men with the refrain , " It must 've been kids . " Spermwhale just nodded and said , " Yeah , kids , " and noted that the burglar went through the file cabinet by opening the drawers bottom to top so that he would not have to push the drawers shut thus taking a chance of leaving a fingerprint . That he had carefully ransacked all file boxes , drawers and logical places where money is hidden . That he had pocketed only easy to carry items . That he had stolen fifteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cents on the dollar and had left , closing the self-latching door behind him so that any doorshaking watchman would find nothing amiss during the evening rounds . " All the good stuff he did n't even touch , " the vice president of the company said . " The typewriter , the calculator . Anyone but kids would 've taken something besides stamps , would n't he , Officer ? " " Oh sure . Had to 've been kids , " Spermwhale agreed as the124 / THE CHOIRBOYSvice president managed a relieved smile . Spermwhale wrote " Stamp and money burglar " in the MO box of his report . Spermwhale had lapsed into a very bad mood when they took the burglary report to the station that night . He had just been turned down by Lieutenant Finque on his request to hang a picture of his old friend Knuckles Garrity in the coffee room . Garrity had been a Central beat cop for fifteen years and finished out his twenty-five year career at Wilshire Station where he and Spermwhale were radio car partners . Just before Garrity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involved in his third divorce and was found shot to death in his car in the station parking lot . The car was locked from the inside with the keys in the ignition and his service revolver was on the seat beside him . Yet , despite all logic , Spermwhale refused to believe that his partner had not been murdered . He had to be given three special days off to get his thoughts together . Finally he acceptedKnuckles Garrity 's obvious suicide and became the partner of Baxter Slate and eventually a MacArthur Park choirboy . Spermwhale Whalen had been broken in on a Central beat by Knuckles Garrity who told his rookie partners that a policemanonly needed three things to succeed : common sense , a sense of humor and compassion . That none of these could be taught in a college classroom and that most men could succeed without one of the three , but a policeman never could . Spermwhaleshivered for an instant , wondering how Knuckles had lost his sense of humor . Spermwhale obtained the last picture ever taken of Knucklesin his police uniform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the bottom of the picture which said simply : Thomas " Knuckles " GarrityE.O.W. 4-29-74It was on a lovely April afternoon with arrows of sunlight darting through the smog that Knuckles Garrity went End-ofWatchforever in the old police station parking lot on Pico Boulevard . Spermwhale Whalen and Baxter Slate / 125But the lieutenant said the picture would have to come down from the coffee room wall and that Spermwhale Whalen should take it home because Knuckles Garrity was not killed on duty like the other dead officers in the pictures which hung in the station . " He was ! " Spermwhale growled to the lieutenant who handed him the picture and turned away from the burning little eyes of the fat policeman . " Listen , Whalen , " Lieutenant Finque explained . " It 's the captain 's decision . Garrity shot himself , for God 's sake . " Spermwhale Whalen very quietly said , " Knuckles Garrity died as a direct result of his police duties . As sure as any cop who was ever blown up in a shootout . Knuckles Garrity was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that cunt of a captain should be proud to have his picture on the wall . " " I 'm sorry , " the lieutenant said , turning and walking back to his office , leaving Spermwhale with the picture in his enormousred hands . " I could shoot somebody , " said Spermwhale Whalen when he got back in the radio car after the incident . Baxter Slate fired up the engine and turned on the lights as darkness settled in . " Anybody in particular ? " " The captain . The lieutenant maybe . Anybody , " Spermwhalesaid , not knowing that in exactly two hours he would shoot somebody and that it would give him almost as much pleasure as if it had been the captain or the lieutenant . But before Spermwhale had that pleasure he and Baxter received a call in 7-A-85 's area because Roscoe Rules and Whaddayamean Dean were handling a call in 7-A-33 's area because Spencer Van Moot and Father Willie had received a fateful call which almost made them the only team in LAPD history to get beaten up by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , see the woman , three-eleven suspect , First and Harvard . " " Seven-A-Thirty-three , roger on the call , " Father Willie automaticallyanswered and then turned suddenly to Spencer . " She say First and Harvard ? " 126 / THE CHOIRBOYS " Yeah , " Spencer replied absently . " A wienie wagger at First and Harvard ! " said Father Willie . Spencer was puzzled for a moment and then said , " Oh . " " Filthy Herman ! " they both cried at once and then a noisy string of obscenities from the black and white startled a woman pedestrian waiting for the light to change on Beverly Boulevard . " Niles and Bloomguard are out fucking off again ! " Spencer whined . " Why are n't they handling the call ? It 's their area ! " " Darn it ! " Father Willie said . " No , wait a minute , I saw them in the station penciling out an arrest report . " " Filthy Herman ! " Spencer groaned as the black and white came to a stop in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which further angered the policeman . " Just put your mind in neutral with the car , partner , " Father Willie advised . " We are n't going anywhere in this traffic for a while . " " Goddamnit ! " snapped Spencer , yelling to any motorist within earshot . " If you 're gon na camp here , pitch a fucking tent ! " The reason that Spencer Van Moot was so angry and Father Willie so apprehensive was Filthy Herman . He was a legless wienie wagger who. lived in a boardinghouse near First and Harvard owned by his daughter Rosie Muldoon who struck it rich by marrying an extremely successful anesthesiologist and now could afford to keep her father , Filthy Herman , in a piece of rental property across town from her . It was ordinarily a good arrangement . The house was large and Herman often had it filled with other alcoholics who congregated in the Eighth Street bars , a half mile from Herman 's home . Filthy Herman was somewhat of a celebrity on Eighth Street , partly because of his grotesque physical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Both legs had been amputated at the buttocks when he was thirty-seven years old , a powerful ironworker until a steel beam crushed him . He was also a celebrity because , with the monthly allowance from the daughter who visited him once a year on Christmas , Herman would buy drinks for every man who could not afford to buy his own . This meant that Filthy Herman had a group of some thirty to forty admirers and hangers-on among his EighthSpermwhale Whalen and Baxter Slate / 127Street entourage . What he did n't spend on drinks for the house he gambled away in gin rummy games or with the many bookieswho frequented the area . About twice a year , for no apparent reason , Filthy Herman would live up to his name and his normal alcoholic binge would end with his standing on two inch stumps on the wooden porch of his home , naked except for a Dodger baseballcap , screaming , " My cock 's dragging the ground , how about yours ? " Which indeed it was , what with the absence of legs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be subjected to a barrage of incredible obscenities , empty bottles , beer cans , spitting , bites on the leg and surprisinglypainful punches from the gnarled fists of Filthy Herman , who at fifty was not devoid of the strength acquired while an ironworker . Any officer who had worked the division long enough had seen the legless torso of Filthy Herman bouncing across the asphaltas he was dragged cursing into the station by two disheveledpolicemen . Because of his physical impairment he was a pathetic sight when cleaned up and no judge had ever given him more than sixty days in the county jail for battery on a police officer . The outraged victim of Filthy Herman was standing with her husband on the northwest corner of First and Harvard when the policemen arrived . Spencer sighed , parked on the east side of Harvard , slowly set the brake and turned off the headlights . He grabbed his flashlight and baton and followed Father Willie across the street . " You call ? " Father Willie asked the fortyish mousy woman who held a white toy poodle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a big man in a loose golf sweater and checkered pants . " My wife was walking the dog , " the man sputtered . " Just out walking our dog and she passed a house up there on Harvard and this filthy little animal , this creature , exposed himself to her ! " " Where 'd it happen ? " Father Willie asked , opening his reportbook and leaning against a car at the curb , his hat tipped back as he wrote. mo , 128 / THE CHOIRBOYS " Back up the street , " the man said . " The third or fourth house . " " You see it , sir ? " Father Willie asked . " No , my wife ran home and got me , and I came back here with her and she pointed out the house , but there was nobody on the porch . I was going to kill him . " And the man put his arm around the skinny woman who clutched the toy poodle more tightly , lip quivering . " What 'd he do , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blanks for type of crime and location . " He exposed himself ! I told you ! " said the man . " Have to hear it from the witness , " Spencer said . " He yelled something horrible to me as I walked by , " the woman answered brokenly . " And he showed himself . Oh , he was a horrible creature ! " " What 'd he look like " asked Father Willie , writing a cursory narrative . " He ... he had no legs ! " cried the woman . " He was a horrible ugly little creature with , oh , I do n't know , grayish hair and a horribly twisted body . And he had no legs ! And he was naked ! Except for a blue baseball cap ! " " I see , " said Father Willie and then , unable to resist , " Did you notice anything unusual about him ? " And the woman answered , " Well , he had a tattoo on his chest , a woman or something . His porch light was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What 'd he say to you when you passed ? " " Oh , God ! " the woman said and the poodle yapped when she squeezed it to her face . " Do we have to ? " the man asked . " I 'd like to go back and kick that little freak clear off the porch . " " You could , " shrugged Spencer , " but he 's a wiry little guy . Probably bite you in the knee and give you lockjaw . " " He said . . . he said . . . God ! " the woman sobbed . " Yeah , " Spencer encouraged her . " He said , I ai n't got no left knee and no right knee , but look at my wienie ! ' Oh , God ! " " Yeah , that 's our man all right , " said Father Willie grimly . " Filthy Herman ! " Spermwhale Whalen and Baxter Slate l 129After taking the complaining party 's name , address and other routine information , the two policemen told them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little criminal . And they knew they stood a good chance of being punched in the balls or bitten on the thigh if they were n't careful . In that Filthy Herman was a legless man , not one team of policemen had ever had the good sense to call for assistance when arresting him . It was a matter of pride that two policemen with four legs between them should not have to call brother officers to help with this recurring problem . " I 'd like to punt the little prick sixty yards , " Spencer said nervously as they climbed the steps to the darkened house of Filthy Herman . " Wish we had a gunnysack to put him in . I hear he bites like a crocodile , " said Father Willie , leading the way with his flashlightbeam trained on the doorway . The officers banged on the door and rang the bell several times until Spencer finally said , " Let 's cut out . We tried . He 's probably in there hiding . Let the dicks get a warrant and go down on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bar at one of those gin mills where he plays the horses . " " Fine by me , " Father Willie breathed , starting to imagine he heard a ghostly dragging chain above him in the dark old house . He looked up and saw dust falling from the porch roof which was sagging and full of holes and patched in several places with plywood and canvas . Then they heard canvas tear and shingles fell on their heads as Filthy Herman sprung his surprise which put Spencer in Central Receiving Hospital for observation . Spencer Van Moot was jolted forward almost out of his shoes , leaving his hat and flashlight behind as he flew crashing through Filthy Herman 's front door while Father Willie stared in shock . Father Willil slowly and incredulously realized what had happened when Filthy Herman came swinging back out the door , suspended by a heavy chain , and spit as he passed . Then he swung back in toward the doorway screaming , " C'm on and fight , you big sissy ! " and spit again. lletectives who filed felony charges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spencer Van Moot were to piece together the story the next day . The self-confessed attacker said he had become tired of being dragged off to jail every time he got a little bit drunk and flogged his dummy on the porch . Filthy Herman had decided to frustrate the next arrest by chaining himself to an ancient steel and porcelain freestanding bathtub in the second story bathroom of his home . He had acquired a fifty foot piece of chain from a fellow horse player on Eighth Street who worked at a wrecking yard , and with a tempered steel lock supplied by the same friend , had crisscrossedhis torso , using the chain like the bandolier of a Mexicanbandit . Then he encircled his waist and locked it in the front . After his crime against the woman with the poodle , Filthy Herman had been in the bathroom on the second floor when he saw the officers arrive . He had planned to fight it out there in the bathroom but suddenly the swashbuckling plan burst forth . He crawled out on the porch roof , dragging his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the front door beneath him . And without anticipating the consequences , he yelled " Geronimo ! " and pitched forward through a hole in the porch roof , swinging down and in , striking SpencerVan Moot behind the neck with 150 pounds of beefy torso and propelling the policeman through the front door , splitting it in two and knocking the doorjamb ten feet across the room . Then he was swinging back and forth , screaming obscenities , spitting , snapping and challenging the bewildered Father Willie . When Father Willie eventually came to his senses with Filthy Herman swaying dizzily in front of his eyes , the choirboybegan yelling , " You dirty little bugger ! " and swinging the nightstick wildly until he broke it on Filthy Herman 's head . Then by the time the neighbors , who were sick and tired of the crashing and screaming , called for additional police , FatherWillie had Filthy Herman punched silly . It took an hour and a half to get Filthy Herman dragged back up on the roof by his chain , pulled into the bathroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Property could arrive with bolt cutters large enough to handle the heavy links . Spermwhale Whalen and Baxter Slate l 131Spencer Van Moot was in the hospital for three days with neck and back spasms . Father Willie was on light duty for a week with two broken bones in his right hand . Filthy Herman had one tooth knocked loose , two black eyes and a broken nose . Both Filthy Herman and his daughter wept in each other 's arms in court three weeks later and Herman was eventually put on probation for one year with the stipulation that he drink no alcoholic beverage . One week after the sentence Filthy Herman got drunk again , masturbated from the step of a fire truck and threw a fire extinguisher at an amazed fireman . Filthy Herman got six months in jail for that one , which proved what all policemen already knew : it 's more risky to beat up firemen because they 're popular . So , while Spencer was meeting his Waterloo at the hands of Filthy Herman , Spermwhale Whalen and Baxter Slate had to meander @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably not be called a ghetto in any other large city in the world , to answer a call that ended up being just another attempt by Clyde Percy to get into Camarillo State Hospital . Clyde Percy was a seventy year old black man who lived in the vicinity of the Baldwin Hills reservoir . Because in the great flood of 1963 he had plunged into the raging water and rescueda drowning woman who was trapped in her overturned car , Clyde Percy was presented with a commendation by the City of Los Angeles , the first official praise he had ever been given in his entire life . Now he simply could n't wander too far from the scene of his triumph and was the object of numerous radio calls . People would find Clyde Percy asleep in their unlockedcars or in the storage sheds of small businesses , and once , in a piece de resistance , he slept all night on a posture perfect mattress in the window of a department store in the Crenshaw shopping district . The next morning he was discovered by passing shoppers still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and all . He was snoring peacefully , slobberingout the side of his toothless mouth , dreaming of some woman far far back in his memory , holding onto an erection which only came in sleep . Clyde got ninety days that time . " Wonder why Spencer Van Moot and Father Willie weren't132 / THE CHOIRBOYSassigned the call , " Spermwhale grumbled to Baxter Slate . " I 'll bet they 're off in some fuckin clothin store buyin some Lord Fauntleroy bow tie for Spencer or some tooty fruity boots . Man 's forty years old and he dresses like an interior decorator or somethin . " The radio call which Spermwhale and Baxter Slate received concerned an open door a tremulous security guard had found while making his rounds at a furniture store on the east side of Crenshaw . The security officer had heard ghostly sounds coming from within the store and though the sun had not yet set , it was dim and shadow filled inside . The guard was seventyfiveyears old and did n't really want to be a security guard but if he relied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife they 'd have to eat dog food five days a week instead of two . " Go on about your rounds , " Spermwhale told the old man . " We 'll check it out . " " I 'll be right over there across the street by my car if you need me , " the guard promised . " I 'll be close to my radio in case you need help . " " Sure , " Spermwhale said , " stay there in case we need you . " And he patted the guard on the shoulder and pointed him toward his car which was not across the street as he thought but in the parking lot back of the building . The old man lost his car at least once a night . When they were alone and dusk was deepening , Baxter said , " We 're calling for another car , are n't we ? " " Nope , " said Spermwhale , " it 's just old Clyde Percy . " " Who ? " " Clyde the lifeguard . The old dingaling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flood . Ai n't you heard a him ? He 's always gettin busted for somethin or other . " " How do you know it 's him ? " " His MO . He breaks into places right after they close and he eats up whatever 's around and goes to sleep . I know it 's him because a the noises the doorshaker said he made . Like a ghost . They always say that , people who call in . " " What 's the noise ? " " He cries . Sits in there and cries . He sounds like a mournful moose . I tell you it 's Clyde Percy in there . " Sperm whale Whalen and Baxter Slate / 133But just in case , Baxter Slate unlocked the Ithaca shotgun from the rack and jacked one in the chamber when they walked single file into the darkened store looking for the mournful moose . It was a small furniture store which advertised entire living room sets for six hundred dollars . Clyde Percy would have none of the cheap furniture . They found him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's office sprawled out on a nine hundred dollar tufted Chesterfield , eating a half empty bag of potato chips and a banana , which one of the clerks had left behind . He wore his regular attire , which was two dirty undershirtsand three outer shirts with a ragged colorless turtleneck sweater over all , a pair of stout flannel pants over longjohn underwear , run over combat boots and a World War II flier 's hat without the goggles . " H'lo , Clyde , " Spermwhale said as Baxter lowered the riot gun and ejected the live round from the chamber . " Aw right , Officer , aw right , " said Clyde Percy , grinning happily and standing at attention , his purple lips smeared with banana , his skin blue-black in the shadows . " Y'all caught me fair an square . Do n't need no handcuffs . I 'm gon na come peaceable . Course if you wan na use handcuffs it 's okay too . " " Ai n't seen you around for a while , Clyde , " Spermwhale said as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holding an elbow because he reeked of wine and staggered on the landing . " Got locked up last November . Jist in time for Thanksgivin . Ai n't missed a Thanksgivin at Central Jail in twenny-eight years . " " You 've been in jail since November ? " Baxter asked as he navigated down the steep stairs gingerly , holding Clyde and the shotgun and now needing a flashlight in the gloom . " No suh , " Clyde Percy said . " This time a wunnuful thing happened to ol Clyde . I was sent to Camarilla State Hospital . The public defender say ol Clyde 's crazy . An first I di n't wan na go cause I likes your jail . I likes the sheriff 's jail even better , no offense to you officers . He tell me , Clyde , we gon na get you sent to this crazy hospital and you gon na like it even better'n jail . So I say okay , and off I go up to Camarilla , and know what ? They gives me a job up there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Baxter said and stumbled with Clyde at the bottom of the stairs , dropping his riot gun and flashlight , kickingthe light under a counter in the dark . While the two policemen got down on their knees to look for the lost flashlight , Clyde Percy picked up the riot gun helpfully and was holding it cradled in his arms like a baby when SergeantNick Yanov came through the front door . " Holy shit ! " yelled Nick Yanov , drawing , crouching , throwinghis flashlight beam on Clyde Percy who had lifted the gun to his shoulder upside down and started eating potato chips over the prone bodies of the two policemen . " Drop the fucking gun or I 'll blow you away ! " Nick Yanov screamed . The next few minutes involved several panic stricken shouts after which Spermwhale sat the sergeant down on a display couch , gave him a cigarette and convinced him they were alive , that Baxter had unloaded the magazine when he ejected the live round , that Clyde Percy was a harmless old acquaintanceof Spermwhale Whalen 's and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steadied . " Sure glad it was you , Sarge , " Spermwhale Whalen said to the chesty , bristle jawed sergeant . " If it was one a them other cunt supervisors he 'd a probably cut old Clyde in half and we 'd a ended up with another suspension for lettin Clyde get wasted . " Why do you do things like this to me , " Nick Yanov said , drawing heavily on the cigarette as some color returned to his face . Then the two policemen and Clyde Percy helped the weak kneed Sergeant Yanov out of the store and to his car , Clyde Percy apologizing profusely for scaring him to death . " Where 's the nearest gas station ? " Sergeant Yanov asked as he got back in his black and white and threw his hat and light on the seat , running both hands through his heavy black hair . " Why , you got ta take a crap ? " Spermwhale grinned . " No , I just did ! I got ta clean up ! " said Nick Yanov as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Good fuckin sergeant , " Spermwhale Whalen mused in an extremely rare moment , and then reverted to his old self . " NotSpermwhale Whalen and Baxter Slate / 135like that eunuch lieutenant and that gelding captain and all the other cocksuckin sergeants on the nightwatch . " " So what 's with the teaching you say you did at Camarillo ? " Baxter asked when they got Clyde safely in the radio car and were on their way to jail to book him for drunk . " I tell you , Officer , " said Clyde Percy , munching toothlesslyon potato chips , " it was such a fine place . They was all these kids , retarded , you know ? Ai n't nobody come to visit em most a the time . They gives em jobs to keep em busy , like makin these little balloon toys . You puts the balloons on the little blow-up stems like . So they gives me the job a helpin watch over all the kids . So I does things like make sure they kin attach balloons right and that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their heads and bite theiF tongues and so forth like that . And then one day I made a invention . I drills holes in this board to put the stems in and then the kids kin attach three balloons at once and makes it easier to hold em . One a the bosses there says to me , Clyde , you jist about the best we ever have workin here . ' So I tells him bout the time I save the lady in the flood and he say , Clyde , you kin stay here if you wants to . ' " " Why 're you out then ? " asked Spermwhale , driving the black and white west on Venice Boulevard . " They say one day they jist ai n't no more room , jist room for real crazy people and I ai n't that crazy . So that night I start sayin I 'm the President and mayor , and like that . But they say it ai n't no good , Clyde , we know you ai n't really crazy like some folks , leastways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And then I thought bout hurtin one a the technicians , punchin em or somethin , but they all so nice to me I could n't . So they put me out and here I is , back home agin . " " That 's a goddamn shame , " Spermwhale said angrily , turning in his seat toward Baxter . " I seen fifty dollar a trick whores , and dopers and pimps , and thieves and assholes for three generationsall on welfare and we ca n't even afford a fuckin bed and three squares at a state hospital for Clyde . That pisses me off ? " " Think you kin do somethin to git me back there ? " asked the old man , his blue lips flaked with potato chips , the left earfla / THE CHOIRBOYSof his flier 's cap turned up from the scuffle with Sergeant Yanov . " By God , if there 's any justice in this miserable world , which there ai n't , somebody oughtta help you . Tell you what , you plead not guilty at your arraignment tomorrow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll talk to the city attorney and tell him that you 're always walkin around the street threatenin everybody and sayin you 're , the Easter Bunny and wavin your dong at housewives and stuffin dog shit in mailboxes and settin trash fires and in general bein a bigger pain in the ass than Francis Tanaguchi . " " Francis who ? " " Oh , never mind , " Spermwhale said as they parked in the station parking lot and got out of the car . " Anyways , I 'm gon na tell him you 're the Wilshire Division whacko and a horrible asshole and you should n't be put away for ninety days for drunk like you usually are because you 're a dingaling . And then I 'll say I think you should get a sanity hearin and shipped off to Camarillo again . " " Oh , Officer , " said Clyde , and the tears welled in the old man 's eyes and he even stopped eating potato chips . " Oh , I 'll be crazier than you say I is , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't go too far , " Spermwhale said . " Just stare off in space and say somethin goofy every time somebody asks you somethin . " " I 'll shoo skeeters that ai n't there , " said Clyde as they shuffled toward the steps of the station . " Yeah , like that , " Spermwhale said as they half lifted the old man up the steps . " I 'll punch a policeman right in the mouf , " said Clyde . " No , do n't do that , " said Spermwhale . " A public defender ? " Baxter Slate suggested . " No , no , " Spermwhale said as they opened the side door and took Clyde inside . " A judge ? How about a judge ? " Baxter offered . " No , " Spermwhale said , " let 's not overdo it . Just swat invisiblemosquitoes or beat off at the jury or somethin . " Then Clyde Percy came to a limping halt in front of the barred jail doors and looked up at Spermwhale , and Clyde'sSpermwhale Whalen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charcoal black in places , was streaked and wet . " I appreciates it , Officer , " he said to the fat policeman . " I wants to go back to the chirruns , back to Camarilla . I appreciateswhat you doin for me . " And then he took Spermwhale 's big hand in his and wept . " Jesus , Clyde ! Okay ! Okay ! " Spermwhale said , pulling his hand away and looking around to see if other policemen were looking . " It 's okay . You do n't have to ... it 's gon na be all right . I do n't mind bein there in court . I ai n't got nothin to do anyways . Jesus , it 's okay . Quit cryin , will ya ? " Spermwhale Whalen did go to the court trial of Clyde Percy , and did succeed in getting a sanity hearing for the old man . But Clyde Percy was deemed not to be a hazard to himself or others and sane enough to be released . He was released , after which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , poured it over his head and lay down in the middle of the intersection at First and Los Angeles streets , having to wait only ninety seconds until a police car heading into the police building was forced to stop , pick up the Baldwin Hills lifeguard and book him into Central Jail on a plain drunk charge . He was given ninety days in the county jail , which was better than nothing but a far cry from Camarillo State Hospital where he invented the device to help retarded children blow up balloons . When Whaddayamean Dean broke into one of his numerous drunken crying jags at choir practice after hearing of the ultimatefate of Clyde Percy , Roscoe Rules called him a nigger lover and said the old cocksucker probably wanted to go back to Camarillo in the first place just to molest the little dummies . Spermwhale Whalen was in a foul mood after they booked Clyde Percy . The mail drop had arrived at Wilshire Station and contained an eight by ten glossy photo sent to Spermwhale by his classmate , Sergeant Harry Bragg of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shot of Spermwhale Whalen'seldest son , Patrick , who had died thirteen months earlier of a drug overdose . It was the only picture the boy had taken in the last two years of his life , this one when he was arrested for car theft in Van Nuys. 138 / THE CHOIRBOYSSpermwhale , the veteran of three failed marriages , had not seen much of the boy after adolescence , and he studied the photo carefully , appreciating the skill of Sergeant Harry Bragg who had removed the booking number and profile shot , and blown up the full face part of the double mug shot until probablyonly a policeman would suspect from whence it had come . Technically it was a successful picture , artistically a dismal failure . He could detect none of the boy 's considerable intelligencein the arrogant eyes and narrow mouth . The shoulder length hair was totally unfamiliar , as was a small fresh scar over the right eye . It was not the son he wanted to remember , not if he wished to keep the guilt from overtaking him . Spermwhale was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Baxter went back to the radio car . The night had become exceptionally black . " What 's wrong with you ? " Baxter asked . " Nothin . " " Look a little mad . " " I ai n't mad . Why should I be mad ? I make seventeen grand a year , do n't I ? Course after income tax and pension contributionand Police Relief and Police Protective League and the credit union and three wives and rent , I have about a dollar thirty cents to eat on between paydays . And I just come off a four day suspension so I got ta stop eatin for about two weeks . So what 've I got to be pissed off about ? " " That it ? Money ? " " Money , who needs money ? Just because I been cuffed around a little bit by the heavy hand a justice ? Just because I lost four days ' pay ? Shit , that ai n't nothin . I only got three ex-wives to support , and three ex-kids . . . no , two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Course the turtle 's sometimes in hibernation so he do n't eat too much . It 's only fair that I got four days ' suspension for keepin those avocados Francis gave me . But the thing bothers me . I wonder if Lieutenant Grimsley and all them IAD headhunters get a finder 's fee when they nail a cop ? Maybe they get a percentage of what the city saves off our paycheck when we get suspended . Ever think a that ? " " I could loan you twenty bucks till payday . " Spermwhale Whalen and Baxter Slate / 139 " Fuck it , I do n't need money . Old Clyde Percy gets along without it , do n't he ? " " It 's pretty decent what you 're going to do for him , " Baxter Slate said . " The way you 're going to bat to get the old man back in the laughing academy . " " Listen , partner , " Spermwhale said , and now the cigar was almost eaten and he was spitting black leafy tobacco out the window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to care about people once in a while , do n't make no mistakes about me . Nineteen plus years a workin these streets has taught me that people are shit . They 're scum . Only reason I do n't treat em like Roscoe Rules or some a those black glove hotdogs is what 's that do for you ? Gets you fired for brutality or an ulcer or somethin . For what ? The human race is no fuckin good but workin with these rotten bastards is all we got , right ? It 's the only game in town so you got ta play like you 're still in the game . If you do n't , if you drop out , you take your fuckin six inch Colt and see can you pull the trigger twice while you 're eatin it . I just do n't wan na off myself like so many cops do . So once in a while I do somethin that might look to you like I give a fuck about some a these scumbags . But there 's nothin more rotten than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night did nothing to change Spermwhale 's mind . " Think I 'll go see my ex-wife tomorrow , " Spermwhale said to Baxter who had just suggested taking code seven at the half price restaurant north of Wilshire on Western . " Which one ? " asked Baxter . " The second ex-wife , " Spermwhale said . " I like her best in some ways . She had the most balls . Took every dime I had . I like to see her once in a while and visit my ex-dog and my ex-car . " " She still give you a little ? " " Would n't want it . Her ass is so big she has to sit down in shifts . And she 's as old as runnin water . I like them young animals like Carolina Moon . Her fat 's all smooth and bouncy . I like em with enough strength to fight ! " " Gon na have to call a choir practice one of these nights , " said Baxter Slate , as the Regretful Rapist was pulling a140 / THE CHOIRBOYSblack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and trying to drag her off behind a large trash dumpster in the darkness . She screamed at two men passing by who just kept walking , observing the golden rule of city dwellers : Do unto others if you want to risk getting your fucking head blown off . " I 'm getting awfully hungry , " Baxter Slate said as the RegretfulRapist was discovering that the black woman was almost as strong as he and was not going to submit , knife or no knife . The rapist was furiously trying to find the dagger she had knocked from his hand to plunge it into her throat . " You know , there 's somethin about Nick Yanov reminds me a my youngest kid , " Spermwhale said as he lit a fresh cigar and Baxter glided slowly around the traffic consisting of diners looking for parking off La Cienega 's Restaurant Row , to avoid tipping valet parking lot attendants . " Your kid is n't that old , " Baxter said . " No , " said Spermwhale , " but he just looks somethin like Yanov . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get in trouble like the others . Last time he came to see me he would n't even accept some clothes I bought him . Only wants to hang around Venice Beach with the hippies . Do n't even want some clean underwear . You see , he ca n't stand ownin anything . He only wants the clothes on his back . Ca n't even stand the responsibility of changin his skivvies . I 'm afraid if he ever went to jail and had someone make all his decisions for him , he might like it . " Baxter Slate tried to think of something to change the subjectbecause he did n't want Spermwhale to start thinking of the oldest boy . And the Regretful Rapist , not a bit regretful at the moment , grabbed the black woman by the throat and almost choked the life out of her before she succeeded in burying her teeth in his bicep and squirming free just long enough to manage a chilling scream which was nearly her very last . " Jesus Christ , what was that ? " Spermwhale jerked upright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the car around and screeched into the darkened parking lot , catching the screaming woman and the raging rapist full in the headlightbeams as they fought on the ground . Spermwhale Whalen and Baxter Slate / 141Then Spermwhale , moving like a younger slimmer man , was out of the car before it stopped , chasing the fleeing rapist across the parking lot shouting , " Stop , you motherfucker , or you 're maggot meat ! " Baxter Slate , finally getting his flashlight to work by banging it on his hip as he ran , caught up with Spermwhale who was standing motionless and aiming two handed at a running shadow eighty feet away . Then there were three explosions in Baxter 's ear and the Regretful Rapist dropped to the asphalt shrieking in terror from a slight wound which entered his lower back , broke two ribs , ricocheted around the rib cage , following the path of least resistance , and exited in the front , causing , aside from the broken ribs , little more than a flesh wound . And this caused Roscoe Rules at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundredth time that they should be permitted to carry dumdums and high velocity ammo . When the two policemen got to the wounded suspect and stood over him , he shook his mop of sweaty hair out of his face and yelled in panic and shock , " You shot me in the back , you chickenshit ! " Spermwhale , panting heavily from excitement and exhaustion , yelled back , " There ai n't no rules out here , you cocksucker ! The Marquis of Queensberry 's just some fag over on Eighth Street ! " And the Regretful Rapist was caught . Spermwhale Whalen and Baxter Slate each received a Class A commendation which was worth exactly nothing in terms of promotion , prestige or economic remuneration . They both offered to trade it for the four days ' pay which had been taken away for accepting the imprudent avocados , but the watch commander told them he did n't think that was very funny . Perhaps Spermwhale Whalen 's greatest contribution was the rapport he established with the rapist in the five hours they were together at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hospital jail ward where they booked him . It started when Spermwhale bought two candy bars for himselfand his starving partner and discovered that he had02 I THE CHOIRBOYSQunched the wrong button and got one full of caramel which rie never ate because it stuck to his partial plate . " Here , want some candy ? " he asked the rapist as the young ion was sitting handcuffed to a chair in the emergency ward . " Thanks , " the rapist said , and Spermwhale noticed that his eyes were glassy and shining from tears , and though he had refused to speak to detectives , the fat policeman said , " Pretty food candy , ai n't it ? You like candy ? " It 's okay , " the rapist said , his large blue eyes moving around the room . Then Spermwhale said , " I did you a favor by shootin you . " The rapist turned , wiped his face on the shoulder of his tornpacket and said , " How 's that ? " " You woulda been booked in an LAPD jail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serve them meals of red death , Gainesburgers and donkey dicks . This way you 're gon na be in the hospital jail ward and then in the county jail when you heal op . Chow 's a hundred percent better . Same with the bed and cell . I did you a favor . " " Thanks . " " You know , I do n't blame you for what you done . I get the urge sometimes myself . Ugly guy like me and all the pussy around just teasin a guy with this no bra stuff and tight pants . Shit , they ask for it . " " You think so ? " " Sure . We all got our bad habits . Hell , I ca n't quit smokin and drinkin , how can I criticize you ? " The Regretful Rapist smiled at the fat policeman and eventuallyaccepted two more candy bars with caramel and almondsand confessed to more than thirty rapes , including twelve which had never been reported to the police but were verified through a detective follow-up . Spermwhale Whalen was given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before a board on a promotional exam . $e had for years been wasting his off-duty time flying 200,000 pounds of mechanized and human cargo for his country instead of taking police science classes at night school . As Captain Drobeck said at a private staff meeting , who in the hell wants supervisors and executives who were only goodSpermwhale Whalen and Baxter Slate / 143for flying airplanes and catching dangerous crooks like the Regretful Rapist ? Besides , Spermwhale Whalen was unpolishedand fat and had ridiculous feet . He wore a wide triple E shoe but his feet were an abnormally short size 7 1/2 . It looked like he was walking on waffles. 9Tommy Rivers " Kudos to Roscoe Rules ! " Sergeant Nick Yanov announced at rollcall on the night Baxter Slate shot the ordinaryguy . " Roscoe just had his annual physical , and the medical report here says his Phthirius pubis count is very low this year . I looked that up and it means body crabs . " After the nightwatch stopped applauding the scowling Roscoe Rules , Lieutenant Finque tried to get everyone in really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homicide detectives of the monstrously bloody corpse of Nathan Zelinski , a seventy-two year old janitor who had been stomped to death by two sixteen year old boys during a burglaryat a junior high school three years earlier . " Drove his nose bones right down his throat , " Lieutenant Finque said . " Old man actually drowned on his own blood . Took him almost forty-five minutes to die . According to their confessions they kept coming over and looking at him every once in a while . " " They have a fascination for such things , " Baxter Slate whispered to no one in particular . " Who ? " Spermwhale asked . " Kids . " " Reason I showed you , " the lieutenant continued , " is thatTommy Rivers / 145the second boy was just released from camp and is back in our division . The first got out four months ago . " And while the nightwatch passed the pictures around and cursed the courts and penal authorities and their lot in general , Sergeant Nick Yanov asked under his breath , " Lieutenant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of course , " the lieutenant answered . " I want them to know what kind of idiots we have to fight within the system . " " Do n't you think they know ? Why keep reminding them they 're shoveling shit against the tide ? Why ? " " We 'll talk about it later , " Lieutenant Finque said . But they never did . On Nick Yanov 's next rating report Lieutenant Finque wrote , " Sergeant Yanov needs a lot of seasoningbefore he can hope to be a top supervisor . Lacks maturity . " And to continue to show Sergeant Yanov who was boss , Lieutenant Finque said to the assembly , " Oh , and by the way , did you hear about the other young kids the Youth Opportunityfolks placed at General Hospital for summer employment . They had lengthy drug records so they put them in the pharmacy washing bottles . You can guess the rest . And a couple of things we discussed at the supervisors ' meeting , " the lieutenant went on , now that he was getting warmed up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burglary and theft reports and do n't want uniformed officers coming in the front door to take reports . Gives the place a bad name . " The lieutenant smiled smugly when he heard the roar this tidbit aroused . " Of course the captain gave them what for . You would 've been proud of him . " " I always knew he was behind us , " said Spermwhale Whalen . " I felt him there many times . " The lieutenant did n't know how to interpret Spermwhale 's observation so he continued with the good news . " And you can all just quit grousing about how long you have to wait in court until your case is called . I 've talked it over with the captain and he talked it over with the commander and he talked it over with the deputy chief ... " " And he talked it over with Dear Abby who 's runnin this fuckin department , " said Spermwhale Whalen . " And he talked it over with his counterpart at the courts , " 146 / THE CHOIRBOYSsaid Lieutenant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at court trials over defendants with public defenders . " " Yeah , " Spermwhale said , " most a the people we bust have public defenders who do n't have to get out quick to make a few more bucks from some other client , so us cops and our civilian witnesses and victims have to cool our heels while these black-robed pussies take care a their fuckin fraternity brothers . If they ai n't got a monopoly I do n't know who does . Who worries about cops ? " " Who worries about victims ? " Baxter Slate observed . " Them too , " Spermwhale nodded . " Well , it 's good to get these things off our chests at rollcall , " Lieutenant Finque said jauntily now that he had turned twenty-eight cheerful men into seething blue avengers . Then Lieutenant Finque said , " Sergeant Yanov 's going to hold a gun inspection while I keep an appointment with the captain . There 've been some dirty guns in recent inspections and the captain says he 's going to start coming down hard on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work a damned good division . Even the people we serve are the best . Our citizens show a great interest in the Basic Car Plan meetings and they purchase lots of whistles . " " Hey , Lieutenant , " Spermwhale said . " Is it true the station buys those whistles for seven cents ? " " I do n't know the details , " said Lieutenant Finque . " That 's a forty-three cent profit on each whistle , " said Spermwhale . " I do n't know the details . " " Jesus , we musta made thousands a bucks with this caper , " Spermwhale observed . " I do n't know , but it 's for our Youth Services Fund so it 's a worthy cause . " " Is is true there 's some civilian whistle maker flyin all over the goddamn country tryin to sell the idea to other departments ? " " I 'm not familiar . " " What a scam . You got ta hand it to some a the eunuchs in this department . Once in a while they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't I think a that ? I coulda made enough in one year to pay off all my ex-wives ! " " Enough on whistles , " Lieutenant Finque smiled nervously , since he was the eunuch who thought of it or at least who stole the idea from the senile old lady who thought crime could be stamped out if there were thousands of other old ladies running around blowing whistles at bad guys . " Maybe I could get in on the action , Lieutenant , " Spermwhalepersisted . " I got this idea for sellin one to every broad in the city . See , we design a whistle shaped like a cock and the part you hold is shaped like a pair a balls with two LAPD badges pinned to them . Our sales motto could be Blow for your local policeman . ' " " It might work , Lieutenant ! " cried Francis Tanaguchi . " That 's a swell idea , Spermwhale ! " cried Spencer Van Moot . " I know a guy could design the whistles ! " cried Harold Bloomguard . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this . He 'd discuss a serious subject with the men and they 'd end up making fun of him . Supervisor or not , he would have given anything to punch Spermwhale Whalen right in his big , red , scarred up nose . And he 'd have done it too if he were n't petrified of the fat policeman and if he were n't absolutely sure Spermwhale would break his back . " I think you better hurry if you 're going to make your appointment , " Sergeant Yanov suggested , to save his superior officer from further trauma . But before Lieutenant Finque walked out the door he said , " I 'll tell you men one thing . Because of our whistles we 've developed excellent rapport with the people we serve . If you should get in a fight with a suspect out there on these streets you do n't have to worry . Our good people wo n't stand by and let you get kicked in the head ! " " No , they 'll cut it off and shrink it , " Roscoe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yanov tried to make the gun inspection palatable by taking Harold Bloomguard 's gun , looking down the barrel and saying , " Kee-rist , Harold , when was the last time you148 / THE CHOIRBOYScleaned this thing ? There 's a spider been down there so long he has three hash marks on his sleeve . " Baxter Slate was one of three college graduates among the choirboys , the others being Sam Niles and Harold Bloomguard , both of whom obtained degrees while police officers . Two of the others were upperclassmen in part time studies , and all but Spermwhale Whalen had some college units . Baxter Slate not only had his baccalaureate in the classics , but had been a graduate student and honors candidate when he dropped out of college in disgust and impulsively joined the Los Angeles Police Department five years earlier . He was an unusually handsome young man , almost twenty-seven years old . He lived alone in a one bedroom apartment . He had no plans for marryingand no ambition to advance in rank . He said he liked working uniform patrol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intensely , that sometimes he seemed to live a week or a month in a single night . Whereas Calvin Potts read every new book in the police library which he thought might help him pass the coming sergeant 's examination , Baxter Slate read no books in the policelibrary since they invariably dealt with law , crime and police . Though Baxter Slate enjoyed doing police work he hated reading about it . And though Baxter Slate firmly believed that his extensive education in the classics had been the most colossal waste of money his mother had ever squandered and that his degree would never at any time in his life be worth more than the surprisingly cheap paper it was printed on , he nevertheless could not break old habits . He would occasionally , for the fun of it , struggle with Virgil and Pliny the Elder to see if he could apply their admonitions to the sensual , selfcontained , alcoholic microcosm of choir practice which to BaxterSlate made more sense than the larger world outside . Most of the choirboys had worked with Baxter as a partner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the division three years and had worked Juvenile for nine months until he discovered he was a lousy Juvenile officer . Baxter thought he was also a lousy patrol officer . No one else said that Baxter was a lousy anything , except Roscoe Rules , who disliked Baxter for havingTommy Rivers / 149ideas which confused Roscoe . At choir practice Roscoe often drunkenly accused Baxter of using ten dollar words just to show off in front of Ora Lee Tingle who was so bombed out on gin and vodka she would n't have known the difference if Baxterhad spoken Latin . And as a matter of fact , Baxter could tell dirty jokes in Latin which amused the choirboys except for Roscoe . " You and your faggy big words , " Roscoe shouted one night as he soaked his feet in the MacArthur Park duck pond , watchingwarily that the ducks did not swim by and attack his toes . " Baxter do n't use big words , " Spermwhale Whalen said , looking as though he would like to pulverize Roscoe Rules , who feared and hated Spermwhale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Well I think he does , goddamnit , " Roscoe said but was careful to smile at Spermwhale when he said it . Baxter was some forty feet away in the darkness , lying on a blanket and shaking his head in wonder that even here in the idyllic tranquilized and totally artificial world of choir practice , it was not entirely possible to escape hostility and violence . " I think it 's faggy and uppity to talk like that , " Roscoe Rules said , while the other choirboys drank and teased Ora Lee Tingleor played mumbletypeg in the grass with confiscated and illegal ten inch stilettos or , like Spermwhale Whalen , tossed little stones on the water to watch the ripples , and to neck with Carolina Moon . Finally Baxter uncoiled his lean body , brushed back his heavy umber hair , longer than anyone 's but Spencer Van Moot 's , who was constantly under fire from the watch commanderto get a haircut , and said , " Roscoe , I sincerely try not to use any big words . " " There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pointed , banging on the arm of his partner Whaddayamean Dean Pratt who was dozing on his blanket . " See , you said sincerely . ' Shit . Faggy word . Faggy is what it is . " " I simply asked the fellows if ... " " See ! You did it again ! " shouted the mean and drunken Roscoe Rules as he punched on Dean to arouse him , but his partner only whimpered drunkenly . " Fellows . ' How many150 / THE CHOIRBOYScops you ever hear say fellows ' ? Cops say guys ' or dudes ' or studs ' or cats , ' but no cop in the history of LAPD ever said fellows . ' Nobody but you , Baxter Slate . " " He did n't say nothin faggy I heard , " Calvin Potts said , and the tall black policeman was suddenly standing behind Roscoe Rules who was thinking that the only thing worse than a fag is a nigger and how much fun it would be to kneedrop Calvin Potts and puncture his kidney and smash his spleen like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell Roscoe what you said so I can relax , " said Francis Tanaguchi who was lost in the expansive bosom of Ora Lee Tingle , trying to persuade her to pull the train for a few of the choirboys . She was now wearing only Spermwhale 's T-shirt and her own skintight black flares as she held Francis Tanaguchi in her arms saying how fucking cute Nips are . " Roscoe , " Baxter said patiently , " I only said that policemen see the worst of people and people at their worst . I was simply trying to explain to you and me and all of us our premature cynicism . That 's all I said and I wish I 'd keep my big mouth shut . " " So do I , " muttered Roscoe . " Fucking ten dollar words . A policeman only needs about a hundred words in his whole vocabulary . " " The only big words I use were taught me in the police academy , Roscoe , " said Baxter . " Words like hemorrhage and defecation . " Baxter took a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Roscoe , even you use euphemisms , police euphemisms , like calling your nightstick a baton because the LAPD says to call it that . I refuse to call it that . A baton is a plaything for young girls . There 's no phallic connotation whatsoever . If I 'm going to carry something to beat people over the head with I insist it have Freudian implications . I learned that in graduate school . Everything must have Freudian implications . " " You making fun a me , Slate ? " Roscoe demanded , trying to stagger to his feet . " You know , a graduate student would love to use a big faggy word like emasculated ' on you , Roscoe . That 's a favorite word of all graduate students . And they would say of your baton thatTommy Rivers / 151the true symbol of your sexual identity is the wooden appendageyou store at the station . In other words , your cock 's in your locker . " " Oh , I do n't like you , Slate , I never liked you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Slate any less than he liked Harold Bloomguard , Francis Tanaguchi , Calvin Potts and Spermwhale Whalen , not necessarily in that order . He only just tolerated his partner , Dean Pratt , who was starting to get on his nerves , and Father Willie Wright who seemed to be afraid of him . " Let 's talk economics instead of philosophy , Roscoe , " Baxter Slate said , deciding to test the meanest choirboy . " I think that the inflationary period follows the prediction of the deficit meanders of corollary Harry , that Roscoes can not breed in captivity and that Chandu the Magician is a cousin of the condor at Santa Barbara . " " I do n't buy that faggy idea any more than the last one , " Roscoe Rules said , passing the test . " Whaddaya mean , Baxter ? Whaddaya mean ? " asked WhaddayameanDean who had crawled across the grass into the conversation area . " What do I mean , Dean , my friend ? " said Baxter Slate . " I mean that I was a lousy Juvenile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a battered child has a marvelous capacity to adjust to his torture and will ceaselessly love his battering parents . I mean that the mother of a sexually molested child will not leave nor truly protect the child from the father as long as the man has a good job or otherwise preserves that mother from an economic life which is more horrifying to her than the molestation of her child . I mean that the weakness of the humanrace is stupefying and that it 's not the capacity for evil which astounds young policemen like you and me , Dean . Rather it 's the mind boggling worthlessness of human beings . There 's not enough dignity in mankind for evil and that 's the most terrifying thing a policeman learns . " " Whaddaya trying to say , Baxter ? Whaddaya trying to say ? " pleaded Whaddayamean Dean drunkenly . " I mean that twelve good men and true are a gaggle of nonprofessional neophytes conditioned by the heroics of152 / THE CHOIRBOYScinema juries which inevitably free the defendant who is inevitablyinnocent . I mean that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such an unnatural thing to his child . " " I do n't get it ! I do n't get it ! " cried Whaddayamean Dean . " I mean that doctors and professional men are the most arrogant and incompetent witnesses at any criminal proceedingsand that they 'll screw up your case for sure . " I mean that the weak and inept parents will always refuse to surrender their neglected children to the authorities because they want to atone for failures with older children and the cycle inevitably repeats itself . " I mean that perhaps economics , not morality , is our lastconsideration , and that the judge has a point when you plead with him to put a man away to save that man 's family and the judge says , Swell , but who do you want me to let out ? ' " " What 's he mean ? What 's he mean ? " yelled Whaddayamean Dean to the drunken choirboys . Dean was boozy enough for a crying jag now , the tears welling as he bobbed and weaved and almost fell over backward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal with small inflexible men in their own ranks , perhaps it becomes too much . And perhaps part of the reason that Roscoe Rules is small and inflexible and insensitive is because traditional police administrators  --  men like Captain Drobeck , and Commander Moss and Chief Lynch  --  are small and inflexible and insensitiveand ... " " I heard that faggy remark , Slate , you scrote ! " said Roscoe Rules , still unable to stand . " I mean that cops chase society 's devils as well as their own , which becomes unbearably terrifying since the devil is at last only the mirror image of a creature utterly without worth or dignity . And that the physical dangers of police work are grossly overrated but the emotional dangers make it the most hazardous job on earth . " " Oh , Baxter , oh , Baxter , " moaned the bewildered WhaddayameanDean who was starting to get sick . " I mean that I carry only two memories from my childhood in Dominican boarding schools where I was placed by my beautiful , well traveled mother : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teeth it 's not so good and should be avoided . And the only unforgivable sin is to murder yourself because there is absolutely no possibility of absolution and redemption , and ... " " What the fuck 're you babblin about , Baxter ? " asked SpermwhaleWhalen who was suddenly behind Baxter , having slept long enough to be more or less capable of driving home before dawn . " Spermwhale ! Thought you were stacking those Z 's . " Baxter Slate offered his partner a quick wide grin and a drink of vodka . " Baxter , you sound like a silly pseudointellectual horse 's ass . You 're gettin embarrassin . C'm on , I 'll drive you to your pad . " Spermwhale felt a stab of pain across the front of his skull when he lifted his young partner to his feet and helped steady him . Actually , Baxter Slate was rarely such a silly **25;2471;TOOLONG ass , but he had been undergoing a prolonged periodof despondency brought about partly because he thought he had been such an unsuccessful Juvenile officer . The murder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Juvenile officer because Baxter Slate had foreseen the imminent demise of Tommy Rivers and had been powerless , or rationalized that he was powerless , to prevent it . It was three months to the day after Tommy Rivers ' death and almost two months before the choir practice shooting that Baxter Slate became the only one of the ten choirboys to kill a man on duty . Contrary to film and fiction , policemen rarely fire their guns in combat , and even Spermwhale Whalen with nineteen and a half years service and Spencer Van Moot with sixteen years had never killed a man on duty . The flesh wound to the RegretfulRapist was the only time Spermwhale had ever fired his revolver outside of monthly qualification shooting , even includingthe Watts Riot . So it naturally became a topic of conversationduring choir practice when Baxter Slate killed a man . The night Baxter Slate killed a man started out a busy one . Ten minutes after they hit the bricks and cleared at 3:45 in the afternoon , Roscoe Rules and Dean Pratt put out an " officers154 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vicinity of Dorsey High School . A call for either help or assistance demands all-out coverage , and every car on the nightwatch made a squealing turn and headed south through the heavy afternoon traffic , figuring that Roscoe Rules had probably caused a riot at the school . As it turned out the call was indeed put out by Roscoe Rules . He and Dean had been driving by the campus so Roscoe could show off by parading his tailored blue body and gleaming badge in front of the high school girls , when they spotted a young black car stripper struggling with the bucket seats of a Porsche which was parked in the faculty parking lot . Whaddayamean Dean had dropped his baton getting out of the radio car and the clatter of wood on asphalt caused the sweating car stripper to look back and see the " Mickey Mouse ears " on the roof of the police car , which is what students call the siren lights . The car stripper was off in a 9.5 hundred yard dash which left Dean far behind and Roscoe radioing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ran right into the arms of a pretty , twenty-five year old , white history teacher named Pamela Brockington who saw the exhausted policeman hotfootingafter the boy . She pushed the boy into the gymnasium and was standing in front of the door when the lanky redhead came panting up to her . " That boy go in there ? " Dean gasped . " I know that boy , Officer , " Pamela Brockington said . " Whateverhappened we can settle it without your running through the school grounds and starting a problem . " " Out . . . out of the way , lady , " Dean puffed . " Listen , you 're on Board of Education property , " the teacher said , planting her feet and spreading her legs , which was n't easy , her blue jersey skirt being so tightly fitted . " You know him , okay , it 's no problem , " Dean said , catching his breath . " Just give us his name and we 'll pick him up at home . " " Well , what did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked unsure of herself . " Tried to rip off the bucket seats from a white Porsche in the parking lot . What 's the kid 's name ? " Tommy Rivers / 155 " Oh , " the teacher said in a small voice . " Your car ? " " No , Mr. Krump 's car . Oh . " " What 's his name ? " " Well , I do n't actually know his name but he 's always around . " Pamela Brockington moved aside to let Dean into the gym . But it was far too late and the car stripper had gone out the other door . " He goes to school here , does n't he ? You can pick his picture out of your school mug shots , " Dean said , removing his hat and wiping the sweat from his freckled brow . " Well , I do n't think he actually goes to school here , but ... " and the young woman started to wither under the outraged scowl Dean was working up to . " He 's . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school and I 'm sure you could find him again tomorrow or the next day . " When Dean returned to the radio car without the car stripperand with the tale of Pamela Brockington , Roscoe Rules smiled ironically and in a very soft voice said , " Now ai n't that typical , partner ? I mean that 's just so typical of some bleeding heart , left wing social science teacher , now ai n't it ? " " I do n't know if she teaches social science , " Dean offered as Roscoe 's voice rose an octave . " Yes , well it certainly is typical and now our little motherfuckingcar stripper is halfway to Watts or wherever the hell . " " You broadcast a description ? " Dean asked as he saw the familiar mad glint working its way into Roscoe 's blue eyes as his hairless brows knitted and unknitted , making Dean terribly nervous because he did n't know if Roscoe would suddenly turn on him . Which he did . " And you ... partner , " Roscoe said , his voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ready to leave half a tire on the pavement . " You , partner , let this little pinko , scum eating , shit sucking cunt keep you from hot pursuit ? It 's hard to believe ! " " Well . . . partner , " Dean gulped . " We 'll get him some other time . Maybe . " " And now you 're sounding just like what this nigger loving split tail must 've sounded like , partner . If I 'd a been there I 'd a grabbed that come licking , do-gooder little cunt and CHOKED156 / THE CHOIRBOYSHER OUT AND MADE HER DO THE FUCKING CHICKEN ! YOU HEAR ME ? " It was quite an ordinary Roscoe Rules incident , interesting later to Baxter because the car stripper ran across Exposition Boulevard and up Palmgrove Avenue where he made the almostfatal error of crossing through the fenced yard of Yolanda Gutierrez , aged sixty-two , and her niece , Rosario Apodaca , aged fifty-one , who , unlike Pamela Brockington , spoke no Englishbut understood immediately what it meant when this young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a black and white cruised by with the officers craning their necks . Yolanda Gutierrez calmly opened a trunk belonging to her son who had been killed in Korea twenty-three years earlier , removed his Colt .45 automatic and drew down on the boy . The young car stripper laughed like hell at the old woman holding the heavy gun until Yolanda Gutierrez fired one for effect and blew out the window of the car parked in front of the house . The car stripper fell shrieking to the ground , not knowing the old lady had lost the bucking gun and her glasses and was crawling around the porch trying to find both when two black and whites attracted by the explosion came roaring down the street and arrested the car stripper . " Something to be learned here , " Baxter Slate remarked later to Spermwhale . " How two social classes perceive reality . The educated schoolteacher and the simple old woman . " " Who gives a fuck about reality anyways ? " Spermwhale mumbled . " Not me , " Baxter grinned cheerfully . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Baxter 's wide grin vanished as he watched a yellow gangrenous dog being dragged down the street by a larger bitch who had him locked inside her , his passion having turned to agony and howling terror . A gang of black kindergarteners , as guileless as a bunch of plums , laughed and pelted both muddy animals with rocks and tin cans . " Maybe I 'll fly another raid with some a the guys my next day off , " Spermwhale suddenly said . " Need some excitement around here . " Tommy Rivers / 157 " Do n't start that nonsense again , " Baxter said , putting on his sunglasses and driving back toward their beat . Spermwhale began to think about the mission he had flown three weeks earlier . It had started innocently enough with some alcoholic conversation at choir practice about how the white men of Palm Springs had cheated the Indians out of their birthright by stealing the desert spa from the Indians . Roscoe Rules had corrected them by pointing out that Jews and not white men had done it and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of those kike bastards and cut off their scalps and kneedrop them . Then , at precisely fifteen minutes before dawn , Francis Tanaguchi slapped Spermwhale Whalen awake where he slept entwined in the chubby arms of Carolina Moon . " I 'd love to see those two in a lewd movie , " Francis Tanaguchiremarked as they threw dirty pond water in Spermwhale 's face until he gagged and choked for air . " Why bother ? " Calvin said . " You can see them in real life anytime you want just by sneakin behind the bushes where they usually mate . " " Yeah , but it 'd be different in a movie , " Francis answered . " You know , a red sexy room with a red silky bedspread and Carolina and Spermwhale all fat and white and oiled and slidingaround ! " " You 'd need a cinemascope lens , " Baxter Slate offered . " A wide wide angle to take in all that flesh . " " Wall to Wall Meat ! What a title ! Outta sight ! " cried Francis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dean and Spermwhale , who were all off duty the next night , were in Spermwhale 's rented orange and white Cessna 172 at Burbank Airport where Spermwhale often flew if he could get someone to pay for the rental and gasoline . Spermwhale had taken off without a flight plan , but with three hungover choirboys , two fifths of Scotch and one of gin , on a mission to recapture Palm Springs by way of Ontario Airport where Spermwhale reluctantly agreed to land because Whaddayamean Dean wanted some potato chips . They were reprimanded at Ontarioby a man in the tower for landing without using the radio , but Spermwhale told him to fuck ofr and decided to158 / THE CHOIRBOYShire a taxi to the Ontario Motor Speedway to watch some motorcycles qualifying for a race . It was a long hot day at the racetrack spent sleeping shirtless in the bleachers , drinking the two fifths of Scotch and a case of beer and eating all the potato chips Whaddayamean Dean could hold . Nothing eventful happened at the speedway until late in the afternoon when the choirboys wandered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get his fat ass off his bike . Spermwhale replied that he could fix it so the bearded racer could equal Evel Knievel 's record for broken bones on a motor track . The racer then called for track security officers and after being threatened with arrest the four choirboys put on their tank tops and basketball jerseys and scuttled off , moaning about never being able to find a cop when you want one . Whaddayamean Dean was so drunk he had to be helped into his filthy yellow sweatshirt and they got it on backward with the picture of Bugs Bunny on the back and " What 's Up , Doc ? " on the front . The choirboys discovered something extraordinary during the flight from Ontario to Palm Springs : that flying with a blood alcohol reading of .20 was actually invigorating . They celebrated by breaking open the fifth of gin almost immediately after takeoff and cruising at a carefree five thousand feet . " I hate gin , " Spermwhale said , tipping the bottle and drinking a quarter of a pint without taking it from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It 's what the brothers drink when they ca n't get Scotch , " remarked Calvin Potts , who rode behind the self styled navigator , Francis Tanaguchi , who had never flown in any aircraft except once in the Army on the way to Fort Ord . " But you people can drink airplane fuel , " Francis said , grimacingfrom the burning gin . " Yeah , and you Chicanos are models of sobriety , " said Calvin . " He 's not a Chicano , you fuckin idiot . He 's a Jap . " Spermwhalesaid . " That 's right , " said Calvin Potts , shaking his head . " Guddamn . I better start layin off the booze . I 'm gettin simple ! " Tommy Rivers / 159 " It 's confusin workin with a madman like Francis , is all , " said Spermwhale , belching wetly . " Gin ! Gin ! " cried Whaddayamean Dean , taking the bottle from Calvin and after three long swallows dropping into completeobliterating drunkenness . Twenty minutes from the Palm Springs Airport , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was coming in dangerously low over the San Jacinto Mountains . " Aw shit ! " he said and took the plane up to seven thousand feet . " Dynamite ! " chuckled Calvin Potts as they climbed . " My ears hurt ! My ears hurt ! " Whaddayamean Dean moaned . " Far out !
