Killing was nothing strange to Vasili Taleniekov , but that kind of killing turned his stomach . The threat of such killing was often useful , but not the act itself .

It was training the likes of which the son of introspectiveSocialist teachers could barely believe . He had been plucked out of a quiet home where books and music were the staples , and set down in a world of conspiracy and violence , where ciphers , codes , and physical abuse were the main ingredients . Where all forms of surveillance and sabotage , espionage and the taking of life  --  not murder ; murder was a term that had no application  --  were the subjects studied. , He might have failed had it not been for an incident that changed his life and gave him the motive to excel .

Her position was so minor her name was not even on a payroll ; she was an unimportant organizer of demonstrations , paid with loose Reichsmarks from an expense drawer . She was quite simply a university student far more passionatein her beliefs than knowledgeable , a wild-eyed radical who considered herself a kind of Joan of Arc . But Vasili had loved her . They had lived together for several weeks and they were glorious weeks , filled with the excitement and anticipationof young love . And then one day she was sent across Checkpoint Kasimir . It was such an unimportant thing , a street corner protest on the Kurfurstendamm .

Just like hers . Animals ! American animals who bought their way to victory without a shell having fallen on their soil , whose might was measured by unfettered industry that made enormous profits from the carnage of foreign lands , whose soldiers peddled cans of food to hungry children so as to gratify other appetites . All armies had animals , but the Americans were most offensive ; they proclaimed such righteousness . The sanctimonious were always the most offensive . Taleniekov had returned to Moscow , the memory of the girl 's obscene death burned into his mind . Whatever he had been , he became something else . According to many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own lights none could possibly wish to be better than he was . He had seen the enemy and he was filth . But that enemy had resources beyond imagination , wealth beyond belief ; so it was necessary to be better than the enemy in things that could not be purchased . One had to learn to think as he did . Then outthinkhim . Vasili had understood this ; he became the masterof strategy and counterstrategy , the springer of unexpectedtraps , the deliverer of unanticipated shock  --  death in the morning sunlight on a crowded street corner . Death in the Unter den Linden at five o'clock in the afternoon . At that hour when the traffic was maximum . He had brought that about , too . He had avenged the murder of a child-woman years later , when as the director of KGB operations , East Berlin , he had drawn the wife of an American killer across the checkpoint . She had been run down cleanly , professionally , with a minimum of pain ; it was a far more merciful death than that delivered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appreciation at the news of that death , yet there was no joy . He knew what that man was going through , and as deserved as it was , there was no elation . For Taleniekov also knew that man would not rest until he found his own vengeance . He did . Three years later in Prague . A brother . Where was the hated Scofield these days ? wondered Vasili . It was close to a quarter of a century for him , too . THE MATARESE CIRCLE 43They each had served their causes well , that much could be said for both of them . But Scofield was more fortunate ; things were less complicated in Washington , one 's enemies within more defined . The despised Scofield did not have to put up with such amateurish maniacs as Group Nine , VKR . The American State Department had its share of madmen , but sterner controls were exercised , Vasili had to admit that .

Taleniekov had to worry about surviving in Moscow . Things ... things had changed in a quarter of a century . And he had changed ; tonight was an example , but not the first . He had covertly thwarted the objectives of a fellow intelligence unit . He would not have done so five years ago  --  perhaps not even two years ago . He would have confrontedthe strategists of that unit , and strenuously objected on professional grounds . He was an expert , and in his expert judgment , the operation was not only miscalculated , but less vital than another with which it interfered . He did not take such action these days . He had not done so during the past two years as director of the Southwest Sectors . He had made his own decisions , caring little for the reactions of damn fools who knew far less than he did . Increasingly , those reactions caused minor furors back in Moscow ; still he did what he believed was right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was recalled to the Kremlin and a desk where strategies were remote , dealing with progressive abstractions such as getting shadowy hooks into an American politician . Taleniekov had fallen , he knew that . It was only a question of time . How much time had he left ? Would he be given a small fverma north of Grasnov and told to grow his crops and keep his own counsel ? Or would the maniacs interfere with that course of action , too ? Would they claim the " extraordinary Taleniekov " was , indeed , too danger-ous ? As he made his way along the street , Vasili felt tired . Even the loathing he felt for the American killer who had murdered his brother was muted in the twilight of his feelings . He had little feeling left. 44 THE MATARESE CIRCLE THE MATARESE CIRCLE 45The sudden snowstorm reached blizzard proportions , the winds gale force , causing eruptions of huge white sprays through the expanse of Red Square . Lenin 's Tomb would be covered by morning . Taleniekov let the freezing particles massage his face as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been considerate ; his rooms were ten minutes from his office in Dzerzhinsky Square , three blocks away from the Kremlin . It was either consideration , or something less benevolent but infinitely more practical : his flat was ten minutes from the centers of crisis , three minutes in a fast automobile . He walked into the entranceway of his building , stampinghis feet as he pulled the heavy door shut , cutting off the harsh sound of the wind . As he always did , he checked his mail slot in the wall and as always , there was nothing . It was a futile ritual that had become a meaningless habit for so many years , in so many mail slots , in so many different buildings . The only personal mail he ever received was in foreign countries  --  under strange names  --  when he was in deep cover . And then , the correspondence was in code and cipher , its meaning in no way related to the words on the paper . Yet sometimes those words were warm and friendly , and he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . But only for a few minutes ; it did no good to pretend . Unless one was analyzing an enemy . He started up the narrow staircase , annoyed by the dim light of the low-wattage bulbs . He was quite sure the planners in Moscow 's Iliktrichiskaya did not live in such buildings . Then he heard the creak . It was not the result of structural stress ; it had nothing to do with the subfreezing cold or the winds outside . It was the sound of a human being shifting his weight on a floorboard . His ears were the ears of a trained craftsman , distances judged quickly . The sound did not come from the landing above , but from higher up the staircase . His flat was on the next floor ; someone was waiting for him to approach . Someone wanted him inside his rooms perhaps , egress awkward , a trap being set . Vasili continued his climb , the rhythm of his footsteps unbroken . The years had trained him to keep such items as keys and coins in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weapon , or to be used as a weapon itself . He came to the landing and turned ; his door was only feet away . There was the creak again , faint , barely heard , mixed with the sound of the distant wind outside . Whoever was on the staircase had moved back , and that told him two things : the intruder would wait until he was definitely inside his flat , and whoever it was was either careless or inexperiencedor both . One did not move when this close to a quarry ; the air was a conductor of motion . In his left hand was his key ; his right had unfastened the buttons of his overcoat and was now gripped around the handle of his automatic , strapped in an open holster across his chest . He inserted the key , opened the door , then yanked it shut , stepping back rapidly , silently . into the shadows of the staircase . He stayed against the wall , his gun leveled in front of him over the railing . The sound of footsteps preceded the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the figure 's left hand was an object ; he could not see it now , it was hidden by the heavily clothed body . Nor were there seconds to wait . If the object was an explosive , it would be on a timer-release . The figure had raised his right hand to knock on the door . " Press yourself into the door ! Your left hand in front of you ! Between your stomach and the wood ! Now ! " " Please ! " The figure spun halfway around ; Taleniekov was on him , throwing him against the panel . He was a young man , a boy really , barely in his teens , thought Vasili. lie was tall for his age , but his age was obvious from his face ; it was callow , the eyes wide and clear and frightened . " Move back slowly , " said Taleniekov harshly . " Raise your left hand . Slowly . " The young man moved back , his left hand exposed ; it was clenched into a fist . " I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The young elan 's whisper cracked in fear . " Who are you ? " " Andreev Danilovich , sir . I live in the Cheremushki . " " You 're a long way from home , " said Vasili . The housingdevelopment referred to by the youth was nearly forty-five minutes south of Red Square . " The weather 's terrible and someone your age could be picked up by the militsianyer. " 46 THE MATARESE CIRCLE " I had to come here , sir , " answered Andreev . " A man 's been shot ; he 's hurt very badly . I think he 's going to die . I am to give this to you . " He opened his left hand ; in it was a brass emblem , an army insignia denoting the rank of general . Its design had not been used in more than thirty years . " The old man said to say the name Krupskaya , Aleksie Krupskaya . He made me say it several times so I would n't forget it . It 's not the name he uses down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said to give you . He said I must bring you to him . He 's dying , sill " At the sound of the name , Taleniekov 's mind raced back in time . Aleksie Krupskayal It was a name he had not heard in years , a name few people in Moscow wanted to hear . Krupskaya was once the greatest teacher in the KGB , a man of infinite talent for killing and survival  --  as well he might be . He was the last of the notorious Istrebiteli , that highly specialized group of exterminators that had been an elite outgrowth of the old NKVD , its roots in the barely remembered OGPU . But Aleksie Krupskaya had disappeared  --  as so many had disappeared -- at least a dozen years ago . There had been rumors linking him to the deaths of Beria and Zhurkov , some even mentioning Stalin himself . Once in a fit of rage  --  or fear  --  Krushchev had stood up in the Presidium and called Krupskaya and his associates a band of maniacalkillers . That was not true ; there was never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was too methodical . Regardless , suddenly one day Aleksie Krupskaya was no longer seen at the Lubyanka . Yet there were other rumors . Those that spoke of documentsprepared by Krupskaya , hidden in some remote place , that were his guarantees to a personal old age . It was said these documents incriminated various leaders of the Kremlin in scores of killings  --  reported , unreported , and disguised . So it was presumed that Aleksie Krupskaya was living out his life somewhere north of Grasnov , on a fverma , perhaps , growing crops and keeping his mouth shut . He had been the finest teacher Vasili had ever had ; withoutthe old master 's patient instructions , Taleniekov would have been killed years ago . " Where is he ? " asked Vasili . " We brought him down to our flat . He kept pounding on the floor  --  our ceiling . We ran up and found him . " " We ? " THE MATARESE CIRCLE 47 " My sister and I. He 's a good old man . He 's been good to my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think he will soon be dead , too . Please , hurry , sir ! " The old man on the bed was not the Aleksie Krupskaya Taleniekov remembered . The close-cropped hair and the clean shaven face that once displayed such strength were no more . The skin was pale and stretched , wrinkled beneath the white beard , and his long white hair was a bird 's nest of tiny thin strings , matted , separated , revealing splotches of grayish flesh that was Krupskaya 's gaunt skull . The man was dying and could barely speak . He lowered the covers briefly and lifted a blood-soaked cloth away from the perforated flesh of a bullet wound . Virtually no time was spent on greetings ; the respect and affection in each man 's eyes were sufficient . " I widened my pupils into the death-stare , " said Krupskaya , smiling weakly . " He thought I was dead . He had done his job and ran . " " Who was it ? " " An assassin . Sent by the Corsicans .

" Shell casings , seven millimeter , American . 3ors markings from a Browning Magnum , Grade Four . " " A brutal gun , " said Taleniekov , nodding . " Vert se. liable . And the last weapon that would be used by someone sent from Washington . " The old man did not seem to hear . " The gun used to kill General Blackburn was a Graz-Burya .

" No more than you were involved with Blackburn 's death . Do n't you see ? They know everything ; even of operatives whose skills are proven , but whose minds are tired . Who , perhaps , need a significant kill . They are testingthe highest levels of power before they make their move . " " Who ? Who are they ? " " The Matarese . The Corsican fever  --  " " What does that mean ? " " It spreads . It has changed , far more deadly in its new form . " The old Istrebiteli fell back on the pillow . " You must be clearer , Aleksie .

We are stained by the Matarese . " " Stained ? How ? What are you trying to say ? What in heaven 's name is the Matarese ? " The old man turned his head slowly ; his lips trembled . " Some say it goes back as far as Sarajevo . Others swear it claims Dollfuss , Bernadotte . . . even Trotsky on its list . We know about Stalin ; we contracted for his death . " " Stalin ?

That is the word , and that is one of the truths no one will speak of . So many . . . for so many years . None dare talk of the contracts , the payments . The admissions would be catastrophic . . . for governments everywhere . " " But why ? Why was it used , this Matarese ? " 50 THE MATARESE CIRCLE " Because it was available .

A faint smile appeared on his thin , pale lips . " Every few days , " he said , struggling to be heard , " a driver comes to see me , perhaps take me for a ride in the countryside .

And after sixteen years of commitment he had resigned  --  some said because he was appalled at what his creation had become , while others claimed he was only too aware of the necessary directions it had taken , but could not bring himself to make certain decisions . Nevertheless , duringthe ten years since his departure , he had been con- ' sistently sought out for advice and counseL As he was tonight . Consular Operations had a new director .

He knew only that he wanted Brandon Alan Scofield terminated , removed from the State Department for good . His actions in Amsterdamcould not be tolerated ; they revealed a dangerous and unstable man . How much more dangerous would he be removed from the controls of Consular Operations ? It was a serious question ; the man with the code name , Beowulf Agate knew more about the State Department 's clandestine networks than any other man alive . And since Scofield had initially been brought to Washington years ago by Ambassador Robert Winthrop , Congdon went to the source . Winthrop had readily agreed to make himself available to Congdon but not in an impersonal office or an operationsroom . Over the years , the Ambassador had learned that men involved with covert operations too instinctively reflected their surroundings . Short , cryptic sentences took the place of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be revealed and learned . Therefore , he had invited the new director over for dinner . The meal was finished , nothing of substance discussed . Congdon understood : the Ambassador was probing the surface before delving deeper . But now the moment had come .

" So you want to talk about Brandon . " " Very much so , " replied the new director of Cons Op . " How do we thank such men for what they 've done ? " asked Winthrop . " For what they 've lost ? The field extracts a terrible price . " " They would n't be there if they did n't want to be , " said Congdon . " If , for some reason , they did n't need it .

Indeed , I imagine a great deal has been added to that file . But as for his friends , or lack of them . He 's simply a privateperson , quite a bit more so since his wife died . " Congdon spoke quietly . " She was killed , was n't she ? " ' . yes : ' " In fact , she was killed in East Berlin ten years ago next month . Is n't that right ? " " yes. , ' " And ten years ago next month you resigned the directorshipof Consular Operations . The highly specialized unit you built . " Winthrop turned , his eyes leveled at the new director . " What I conceived and what finally emerged were two quite different entities . Consular Operations was designed56 THE MATARESE CIRCLEas a humanitarian instrument , to facilitate the defection of thousands from a political system they found intolerable . As time went on  --  and circumstances seemed to warrant  --  the objectives were narrowed . The thousands became hundreds  --  and as other voices were heard , the hundreds were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scores of men and women who daily appealed to us , but only in those select few whose talents and information were considered far more important than those of ordinary people . The unit concentrated on a handful of scientists and soldiers and intelligence specialists . As it does today . That 's not what we began with . " " But as you pointed out , sir , " said Congdon , " the circumstanceswarranted the change . " Winthrop nodded . " Do n't mistake me , I 'm not naive . I dealt with the Russians at Yalta , Potsdam , Casablanca . I witnessed their brutality in Hungary in ' 56 , and I saw the horrors of Czechoslovakia and Greece . I think I know what the Soviets are capable of as well as any strategist in covert services . And for years I permitted those more aggressive voices to speak with authority . I understood the necessity . Did you think I did n't ? " " Of course not . I simply meant . . . . " Congdon hesitated . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife and my resignation , " said the statesman kindly . " Yes , sir , I did . I 'm sorry , I did n't mean to pry . It 's just that the circumstances ... " ' Warranted a change , ' " completed Winthrop . " That'swhat happened , you know . I recruited Scofield ; I 'm sure  --  that 's in his file . I suspect that 's why you 're here tonight . " " Then the connection ? ... " Congdon 's words trailed off . " Accurate . I felt responsible . " " But surely there were other incidents , other men .. . and women . " " Not the same , Mr. Congdon . Do you know why Scofield'swife was selected to be the target that afternoon in East Berlin ? " " I assume it was a trap meant for Scofield himself . Only she showed up and he did n't . It happens . " " A trap meant for Scofield ? In East Berlin ? " " He had contacts in the Soviet sector . He made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagine they wanted tocatch him with his contact sheets . Her body was searched , her purse taken . It 's not unusual . " " Your assumption being that he 'd use his wife in the operation ? " asked Winthrop . Congdon nodded . " Again , not unusual , sir . " " Not unusual ? I 'm afraid in Scofield 's case it was impossible . She was part of his cover at the embassy , but never remotely connected to his covert activities . No , Mr. Congdon , you 're wrong . The Russians knew they could never spring a trap on Bray Scofield in East Berlin . He was too good , too efficient . . . too elusive . So they tricked his wife into crossing the checkpoint and killed her for another purpose . " " I beg your pardon ? " " An enraged man is a careless man . That 's what the Soviets wanted to accomplish . But they , as you , misunderstoodtheir subject . With his rage came a new determination to sting the enemy in every way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife 's death , he was viciouslyso afterwards . " " I 'm still not sure I understand . " " Try , Mr. Congdon , " said Winthrop . " Twenty-two years ago I ran across a government major at Harvard University . A young man with a talent for languages and a certain authority about him that indicated a bright future . He was recruited through my office , sent to the Maxwell School in Syracuse , then brought to Washington to become part of Consular Operations . It was a fine beginning for a possibly brilliant career in the State Department . " Winthroppaused , his eyes straying as if lost in a personal reverie . " I never expected him to stay in Cons Op ; strangelyenough I thought of it as a springboard for him . To the diplomatic corps , to the ambassadorial level , perhaps . His gifts cried out to be used at international conference tables .. " But something happened , " continued the statesman , glancing absently back at the new director . " As Cons Op was changing , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defections were considered , the quicker the violence escalated . On both sides . Very early , Scofield requested commando training ; he spent five months in Central America going through the most rigoroussurvival techniques  --  offensive and defensive . He58 THE MATARESE CIRCLEmastered scores of codes and ciphers ; he was as proficient as any cryptographer in NSA . Then he returned to Europe and became the expert . " " He understood the requirements of his work , " said Congdon , impressed . " Very commendable , I 'd say . " " Oh yes , very , " agreed Winthrop . " Because , you see , it had happened : he 'd reached his plateau . There was no turning back , no changing . He could never be accepted around a conference table ; his presence would be rejected in the strongest diplomatic terms because his reputation was established . The bright young government major I 'd recruited for the State Department was now a killer . No matter the justification , he was a professional killer . " Congdon shifted his position in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the field , the battleground extensive , dangerous . . . never ending . He had to survive , Mr. Win-throp . " " He had to and he did , " concurred the old gentleman . " Scofield was able to change , to adapt to the new rules . But I was n't . When his wife was killed , I knew I did n't belong . I saw what I had done : taken a gifted student for one purpose and seen that purpose warped . Just as the benign concept of Consular Operations had been warped  --  by circumstances that warranted those changes we spoke of . I had to face my own limitations . I could n't continue any longer . " " But you did ask to be kept informed of Scofield 's activitiesfor several years . That 's in the file , sir . May I ask why ? " Winthrop frowned , as if wondering himself . " Fm not sure . An understandable interest in him  --  even fascination , I suppose . Or punishment , perhaps ; that 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my safe for days before I read them . And , of course , after Prague I no longer wanted them sent to me . I 'm sure that 's in the file . " " Yes , it is . By Prague , I assume you refer to the courier incident . " " Yes , " answered Winthrop softly . " Incident ' is such an impersonal word , is n't it ? It fit the Scofield in that report . The professional killer , motivated by the need to survive  --  as a soldier survives , turned into a cold-blooded killer , driven solely by vengeance . The change was complete . " Again the new director of Cons Op shifted his position , THE MATARESE CIRCLE 59crossing his legs uncomfortably . " It was established that the courier in Prague was the brother of the KGB agent who ordered the death of Scofield 's wife . " " He was the brother , not the man who issued that order . He was a youngster , no more than a low-level mes-senger . " " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does it end ? " " I ca n't answer that . But I can understand Scofield 's doing what he did . I 'm not sure I would n't have done the same . " " With no sense of righteousness , " said the aging statesman . " I 'm not sure I would have . Nor am I convinced that young man in Cambridge twenty-two years ago would have done so . Am I getting through to you , as is so often asked these days ? " " Painfully , sir . But in my defense  --  and in defense of the current Scofield  --  we did n't create the world we operate in. t think that 's a fair thing to say . " " Painfully fair , Mr. Congdon . But you perpetuate it . " Winthrop wheeled his chair to his desk and reached for a hox of cigars . He offered the box to the director , who shook his head . " I do n't like them , either , but ever since Jack Kennedy we 're all expected to keep our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No . As I recall , the Canadian supplier was one of President Kennedy 's more accurate sources of information about Cuba . " " Have you been around that long ? " " I joined the National Security Agency when he was a senator .... Did you know that Scofield has recently begun to drink ? " " I know nothing about the current Scofield , as you called him . " " His file indicates previous use of alcohol , but no evifenceof excess . " " I would think not ; it would interfere with his work . " " It may be interfering now . " " May be ? It either is or it is n't . I do n't think that 's such difficult thing to establish . If he 's drinking a great deal , Lat 's excess ; it would have to interfere . I 'm sorry to hear , but I ca n't say I 'm surprised . " " Oh ? " Congdon leaned forward in the chair . It was ap-60 THE MATARESE CIRCLE THE MATARESE CIRCLE 61parent that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeking . " When you knew him as well as you did , were there signs of potential instability ? " " None at all . " " But you just said you were n't surprised . " " I 'm not . I would n't be surprised at any thinking man turning to alcohol after so many years of living so unnaturally . Scofield is  --  or was  --  a thinking man , and God knows he 's lived unnaturally . If I 'm surprised , it 's only that it 's taken so long to reach him , affect him . What got him through the nights ? " " Men condition themselves . As you put it , he adapted . Extremely successfully . " " But still unnaturally , " maintained Winthrop . " What are you going to do with him ? " " He 's being recalled . I want him out of the field . " " Good . Give him a desk and an attractive secretary and have him analyze theoretical problems . Is n't that the usual way ? " Congdon hesitated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want him separated from the State Department . " The creator of Cons Op arched his eyebrows . " Really ? Twenty-two years is insufficient for an adequate pension . " " That 's not a problem ; generous settlements are made . It 's common practice these days . " " Then what does he do with his life ? What is he ? Fortyfive ... six ? " " Forty-six . " " Hardly ready for one of these , is he ? " said the statesman , fingering the wheel of his chair . " May I ask why you 've come to that conclusion ? " " I do n't want him around personnel involved with covert activities . According to our latest information , he 's dia played hostile reactions to basic policy . He could be a negativeinfluence . " Winthrop smiled . " Someone must have pulled a beaut . Bray never did have much patience with fools . " " I said basic policy , sir . Personalities-are not the issue . ' " Personalities , Mr. Congdon , unfortunately are intrirs ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's probably besid the point . . . at this point . Why come to me ? You 've obviously made your decision . What can I add ? " " Your judgment . How will he take it ? Can he betrusted ? He knows more about our operations , our contacts , our tactics , than any man in Europe . " Winthrop 's eyes became suddenly cold . " And what is your alternative , Mr. Congdon ? " he asked icily . The new director flushed ; he understood the implication . " Surveillance . Controls . Telephone and mail intercepts . I 'm being honest with you . " " Are you ? " Winthrop now glared at the man in front of him . " Or are you looking for a word from me  --  or a question  --  that you can use for another solution ? " " I do n't know what you mean . " " I think you do . I 've heard how it 's done , incidentally , and it appalls me . Word is sent to Prague @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no longer in sanction . He 's finished , out . But he 's restless , drinks a lot . Contacts ' names might be revealed by this man , whole networks exposed . In essence , the word spreads : your lives are threatened . So it 's agreed that another man , or perhaps two or three , get on planes from Prague or Berlin or Marseilles . They converge on Washington with but one objective : the silencing of that man who 's finished . Everyone 's more relaxed , and the American intelligence community  --  which has remained outside the incident  --  breathes easier . Yes , Mr. Congdon , it appalls me . " The director of Cons Op remained motionless in the chair . His reply was delivered in a quiet monotone . " To the best of my knowledge , Mr. Winthrop , that solution has been exaggerated far out of proportion to its practice . Again , I 'll be completely honest with you . In fifteen years I 've heard of it being exercised only twice , and in both .. . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond salvage . They had sold out to the Soviets ; they were deliveringnames . " " Is Scofield beyond salvage ' ? That 's the correct phrase , is n't it ? " " If you mean do I think he 's sold out , of course not . It 's the last thing he 'd do . I really came here to Iearn more about him , I 'm sincere about that . How is he going to react when I tell him he 's terminated ? " Winthrop paused , his relief conveyed , then frowned again . " I do n't know because I do n't know the current Scofield . It 's drastic ; what 's he going to do ? Is n't there a halfway measure ? " 62 THE MATARESE CIRCLE " If I thought there was one acceptable to us both , I 'd leap at it . " " If I were you I 'd try to find one . " " It ca n't be on the premises , " said Congdon firmly . " I 'm convinced of that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Please do . " " Send him as far away as you can . Someplace where he 'll find a peaceful oblivion . Suggest it yourself ; he 'll un- derstand . " " He will ? " " Yes . Bray does n't fool himself , at least he never did . It was one of his finer gifts . He 'll understand because I think 1 do . I think you 've described a dying man . " " There 's no medical evidence to support that . " " Oh , for God 's sake , " said Robert Winthrop . Scofield turned off the television set . He had not seen an American news broadcast in several years  --  since he was last brought back for an interoperations briefing  --  and he was not sure he wanted to see one again for the next sev- eral years . It was n't that he thought all news should be delivered in the ponderous tones of a funeral , but the gig- glen and leers that accompanied descriptions of fire and rape struck him as intolerable . He looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He knew it because his watch read twenty past midnight ; he was still on Amsterdam time . His appointment at the State Department was for eight o'clock . P.m . That was standard for specialists of his rank , but what was not standard was the State Department location itself . Attaches-at-large for Consular Operations invariably held strategy conferences in safe-houses , usually in the Maryland countryside , or perhaps in hotel suites in down- town Washington . Never at the State Department . Not for specialists ex- pected to return to the field . But then Bray knew he was not scheduled to return to the field . He had been brought back for only one purpose . Termination . Twenty-two years and he was out . An infinitesimal speck of time into which was compressed everything he knew  --  everything learned , absorbed and taught . He kept waiting for his own reaction , but there was none . It was as 111 L IYIA I AR LJL , TRILL N.lthough he were a spectator , watching the images of soniconeelse on a white wall , the inevitable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ events as they took place . He was only mildly curious . How would it be done ? The walls of Undersecretary of State Daniel Congdon 's office were white . There was a certain comfort in that , thought Scofield , as he half-listened to Congdon 's droning narrative . He could see the images . Face after face , dozens of them , coming into focus and fading rapidly . Faces of people remembered and unremembered , staring , thinking , weeping , laughing , dying . . . death . His wife . Five o'clock in the afternoon . Unter den Linden . Men and women running , stopping . In sunlight , in shadows . But where was he ? He was not there . He was a spectator . Then suddenly he was n't . He could not be sure he heard the words correctly . What had this coldly efficient undersecretarysaid ? Bern , Switzerland ? " I beg your pardon ? " " The funds will be deposited in your name , proportionateallocations made annually . " " In addition to whatever pension I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And regarding that , your service record 's been predated . You 'll get the maximum . " " That 's very generous . " It was . Calculating rapidly , Bray estimated that his income would be over $50,000 a year . " Merely practical . These funds are to take the place of any profits you might realize from the sale of books or articles based on your activities in Consular Operations . " " I see , " said Bray slowly . " There 's been a lot of that recently , has n't there ? Marchetti , Agee , Snepp . " " Exactly . " Scofield could not help himself ; the bastards never learned . " Are you saying that if you 'd banked funds for them they would n't have written what they did ? " " Motives vary , but we do n't rule out the possibility . " " Rule it out , " said Bray curtly . " I know two of those men . " " Are you rejecting the money ? " 64 THE MATARESE CIRCLE " Hell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decide to write a book , you 'll be the first to know . " " I would n't advise it , Mr. Scofield . Such breaches of security are prohibited . You 'd be prosecuted , years in prison inevitable . " " And if you lost in the courts , there just might follow certain extralegal penalties . A shot in the head while drivingin traffic , for example . " " The laws are clear , " said the undersecretary . " I ca n't imagine that . " " I can . Look in my Four-Zero file . I trained with a man in Honduras . I killed him in Madrid . He was from Indianapolisand his name was  --  " " I 'm not interested in past activities , " interrupted Congdonharshly . " I just want us to understand each other . " " We do . You can relax , I 'm not . . . breaching any security . I have n't the stomach for it . Also , I 'm not that brave . " " Look , Scofield , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expression pleasant . " I know it sounds trite , but there comes a time for all of us to leave the more active areas of our work . I want to be honest with you . " Bray smiled , a touch grimly . " I 'm always nervous when someone says that . " " What ? " " That he wants to be honest with you . As if honesty was the last thing you should expect . " " I am being honest . " " So am I. If you 're looking for an argument , you wo n't get it from me . I 'll quietly fade away . " " But we do n't want you to do that , " said Congdon , leaningforward , his elbows on the desk . " Oh ? " " Of course not . A man with your background is extraordinarilyvaluable to us . Crises will continue to arise ; we 'd like to be able to call upon your expertise . " Scofield studied the man . " But not in-territory . " A statement . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Naturally , we 'll want to know where you 're living , what trips you make . " " I 'll bet you will , " said Bray softly . " But for the record , I 'm terminated . " THE MATARESE CIRCLE 65 " Yes . However , we 'd like it kept out of the record . A Four-Zero entry . " Scofield did not move . He had the feeling that he was in the field , arranging a very sensitive exchange . " Wait a minute , let me understand you . You want me officially terminated , but no one 's supposed to know it . And although I 'm officially finished , you want to maintain contact on a permanent basis . " " Your knowledge is invaluable to us , you know that . And I think we 're paying for it . " " Why the Four-Zero then ? " " I 'd have thought you 'd appreciate it . Without official responsibilities you retain a certain status . You 're still part of us . " " I 'd like to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . . " Congdon stopped , a slightly embarrassed smile on his face . " We really do n't want to lose you . " " Then why terminate me ? " The smile left the undersecretary 's face . " I 'll call it as I see it . You can confirm it with an old friend of yours if you like . Robert Winthrop . I told him the same thing . " " Winthrop ? What did you tell him ? " " That I do n't want you around here . And I 'm willing to pay out of budget and predate records to get you out . I listened to your words ; you were taped by Charles Englehartin Amsterdam . " Bray whistled softly . " Old Crimson Charlie . I should have known it . " " I thought you did . I thought you were sending us a personal message . Nevertheless , we got it . We have a lot to do here and your kind of obstinacy , your cynicism , is n't needed . " " Now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is true . We do need your expertise . We have to be able to reach you anytime . You have to be able to reach us . " Bray nodded . " And the Four-Zero means that my separationis top secret . The field does n't know I 'm terminated . " " Precisely . " " All right , " said Scofield , reaching into his pocket for a cigarette . " I think you 're going to a lot of unnecessary trouble to keep a string on me , but , as you said , you 're pay-66 THE MATARESE CIRCLEing for it . A simple field directive could accomplish the same thing : issue clearance until rescinded . Special category . " " Too many questions would be asked . It 's easier this way . " " Really ? " Bray lit the cigarette , his eyes amused . " All right . " " Good . " Congdon shifted his weight in the chair . " I 'm glad we understand each other . You 've earned everything we 've given you and I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was looking at your file this morning ; you enjoy the water . God knows your record 's filled with hundreds of contactsmade in boats at night . Why not try it in the daylight ? You 've got the money .

" He extendedhis hand ; Congdon rose and took it . While they shook hands , Scofield continued . " You know that FourZerobusiness would make me nervous if you had n't called me in here . " " What do you mean ? " Their hands were clasped , but the movement stopped . " Well , our own field personnel wo n't know I 'm terminated , but the Soviets will . They wo n't bother me now . When someone like me is taken out-of-strategy , everything changes . Contacts , codes , ciphers , sterile locations ; nothing remains the same . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thanks very much . " " I 'm not sure I understand you , " said the undersecretary . " Oh , come on , I said I 'm grateful . We both know that the KGB operations in Washington keep their cameras trained on this place twenty-four hours a day . No specialist who 's to remain in sanction is ever brought here . As of an hour ago they know I 'm out . Thanks again , Mr. Congdon . It was considerate of you . " The Undersecretary of State , Consular Operations , watched as Scofield walked across the office and let himselfout the door . It was over . Everything . He would never have to hurry back to an antiseptic hotel room to see what covert messagehad arrived . No longer would it be necessary to arTHEMATARESE CIRCLE 67range for three changes of vehicle to get from point A to point B. The lie to Congdon notwithstanding , the Soviets probably did know by now he had been terminated . If they did n't , they would soon . After a few months of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was no longer of value . That rule was constant ; tactics and codes were altered . The Soviets would leave him alone ; they would not kill him . But the lie to Congdon had been necessary , if only to see the expression on his face . We 'd like it kept out of the record . Four-Zero entry . The man was so transparent ! He really believed he had created the climate for the execution of his own man , a man he considered dangerous . That a supposedly active agent would be killed by the Soviets for the sake of a kill . Then  --  pointing to official separation  --  the Department of State would disclaim any responsibility , no doubt insisting that the dead man refused safeguards . The bastards never changed , but they knew so little . An execution for its own sake was pointless , the fallout often too hazardous . One killed for a purpose ; to learn something by removing a vital link in a chain , or to stop something from happening . Or to teach a specific lesson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Prague , and even that could be considered a lesson . A brother for a wife . But it was over . There were no strategies to create , no decisions to make that resulted in a defection or a turnback , of someone living or not living . It was over . Perhaps now even the hotel rooms would come to an end . And the stinking beds in rundown rooming houses in the worst sections of a hundred cities . He was so sick of them ; he despised them all . With the exception of a single brief period  --  too brief , too terribly brief  --  he had not lived in a place he could call his own for twenty-two years . But that pitifully brief period , twenty-seven months in a lifetime , was enough to see him through the agonies of a thousand nightmares . The memories never left him ; they would sustain him until the day he died . It had been only a small flat in West Berlin , but it was the home of dreams and love and laughter he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His beautiful Karine , his adorable Karine .

Death in the Unter den Linden . Oh , God ! A telephone call and a password . Her husband needed her . Desperately . See a guard , cross the checkpoint . Hurry ! And a KGB pig had no doubt laughed . Until Prague . There was no laughter in that man after Prague . Scofield could feel the sting in his eyes . The few sudden tears had made contact with the night wind . He brushed them aside with his glove and crossed the street . On the other side was the lighted front of a travel agency , the posters in the window displaying idealized , unreal bodies soaking up the sun . The Washington amateur , Congdon , had a point ; the Caribbean was a good idea .

The figure was reflected in the glass  --  tiny , obscure , in the background across the wide avenue , barely noticeable . In fact , Bray would not have noticed had the man not walked around the spill of a streetlamp . Whoever it was wanted the protection of the shadows in the street ; whoeverit was was following him . And he was good . There were no abrupt movements , no sudden jumping away from the light . The walk was casual , unobtrusive . He wondered if it was anyone he had trained . Scofield appreciated professionalism ; he would commendthe man and wish him a lesser subject for surveillancenext time . The State Department was not wasting a moment . Congdon wanted the reports to begin at once . Bray smiled ; he would give the undersecretary his initial report . Not the one he wanted , but one he should have . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked away from the storefront window , gathering speed until he reached the corner , where the circles of light from the four opposing streetlampsoverlapped each other . He turned abruptly left , as if to head back to the other side of the street , then halfway through the intersection stopped . He paused in the middle of the traffic lane and looked up at the street sign  --  a manTHE MATARESE CIRCLE 69confused , not sure of where he was . Then he turned and walked rapidly back to the corner , his pace quickening until he was practically running when he reached the curb . He continued down the pavement to the first unlighted storefront , then he spun into the darkness of the doorway and waited . Through the right-angled glass he had a clear view of the corner . The man following him would have to come into the overlapping circles of light now ; they could not be avoided . A quarry was getting away ; there was no time to look for shadows . It happened . The overcoated figure came dashing across the avenue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came into the light . Scofield froze . His eyes ached ; blood rushed to his head . His whole body trembled , and what remained of his mind tried desperately to control the rage and the anguish that welled up and swept through him . The man at the corner was not from the State Department , the face under the light did not belong to anyone remotely connected to American intelligence . It belonged to the KGB . To KGB-East Berlin ! It was a face on one of the half-dozen photographs he had studied  --  studied until he knew every blemish , every strand of hair  --  in Berlin ten years ago . Death on the Unter den Linden . His beautiful Karine , his adorable Karine . Trapped by a team across the checkpoint , a unit set up by the filthiest killer in the Soviet . V. Taleniekov . Animal . This was one of those men .

Only one man could think with such dramaticprecision . V. Taleniekov . Animal . As Bray stared through the glass , he knew what he was going to do , what he had to do . He would send a last message to Moscow ; it would be a fitting capstone , a final gesture to mark the end of one life and the beginning of another  --  whatever it might be . He would trap the killer from KGB . He would kill him. 70 THE MATARESE CIRCLEScofield stepped out of the doorway and ran down the sidewalk , racing in a zigzag pattern across the deserted street . He could hear running footsteps behind him . Aeroflot 's night flight from Moscow approached the sea of Azov northeast of Crimea . It would arrive in Sevastopolby one o'clock in the morning , something over an hour . The aircraft was crowded , the passengers by and large jubilant , on winter holiday leaves from their offices and factories . A scattering of military personnel  --  soldiers and sailors  --  were less exuberant ; for them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return to work at the naval and air bases . They 'd had their leaves in Moscow . In one of the rear seats sat a man with a dark leather violin case held firmly between his knees . His clothes were rumpled , undistinguished , somehow in conflict with the strong face and the sharp , clear eyes that seemed to belong above other apparel . His papers identified him as Pietre Rydukov , musician . His flight pass explained curtly that he was on his way to join the Sevastopol Symphony as third-chair violinist . Both items were false . The man was Vasili Taleniekov , master strategist , Soviet Intelligence . Former master strategist . Former director of KGB operations  --  EastBerlin , Warsaw , Prague , Riga and the Southwest Sectors , which consisted of Sevastopol , the Bosporus , the Sea of Marmara and the Dardanelles . It was this last post that dictated the papers that put him on board the Sevastopol plane . It was the beginning of his flight from Russia . There were scores of escape routes out of the Soviet Union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he had found them .

A minor network-route through the Bosporusand the Sea of Marmara into the Dardanelles . He had uncovered it several months ago , during his last weeks as director , KGB-Southwest Soviet Sectors . During the days when he found himself in continuous confrontation with hot-headed fools at the military bases and asinine edicts from Moscow itself . At the time , he was not sure why he held back exposure ; for a while he had convinced himself that by leaving it open and watching it closely , it could lead to a larger network . Yet in the back of his mind , he knew that was not true . His time was coming ; he was making too many enemies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt that a quiet retirement north of Grasnov was not for a man who held the secrets of the KGB in his head . Now he possessed another secret , more frightening than anything conceived of by Soviet intelligence . The Matarese . And that secret was driving him out of Russia . It had happened so fast , thought Taleniekov , sipping the hot tea provided by the steward . Everything had happened so fast . The bedside  --  deathbed  --  talk with old Aleksie Krupskaya and the astonishing things the dying man had said . Assassins sent forth to kill the elite of the nation  --  both nations . Pitting the Soviet and the United States against one another , until it controlled one or the other . A Premier and a President , one or both to be in a gunsight . Who were they ? What was it , this fever that had begun in the first decades of the century in Corsica ? The Corsican fever . The Matarese . But it existed ; it was functioning  --  alive and deadly . He knew that now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a plan had been put in motion that called for his arrest ; the sentence of execution would follow shortly . Krupskaya had told him that going to the Premier was out of the question so he had sought out four once-powerfulleaders of the Kremlin , now generously retired , which meant that none dared touch them . With each he had spoken of the strange phenomenon called the Matarese , repeated the words whispered by the dying Istrebiteli . One man obviously knew nothing ; he was as stunned as72 THE MATARESE CIRCLETaleniekov had been . Two said nothing , but the acknow ! - edgement was in their eyes , and in their frightened voices when they protested . Neither would be a party to the spreading of such insanity ; each had ordered Vasili from his house . The last man , a Georgian , was the oldest  --  older than the dead Krupskaya  --  and in spite of an upright posture had little time left to enjoy a straight spine . He was ninetysix , his mind alert but given swiftly to an old man 's fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thin , veined hands had trembled , then tiny muscular spasms seemed to spread across his ancient , withered face . His throat became suddenly dry ; his voice cracked , his words barely audible . It was a name from long ago in the past , the old Georgianhad whispered , a name no one should hear . He had survived the early purges , survived the mad Stalin , the insidious Beria , but no one could survive the Matarese . In the name of all things sacred to Russia , the terrified man pleaded , walk away from the Matarese ! " We were fools , but we were not the only ones . Powerfulmen everywhere were seduced by the sweet convenienceof having enemies and obstacles eliminated . The guarantee was absolute : the eliminations would never be traced to those who required them . Agreements were made through parties four and five times removed , dealing in fictitious purchases , unaware of what they were buying . Krupskaya saw the danger ; he knew . He warned us in ' forty-eight never to make contact again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had asked . " If the guaranteewas proven true . I speak professionally . " " Because the Matarese added a condition : the council of the Matarese demanded the right of approval . That 's what I was told . " " The prerogative of killers-for-hire , I 'd think , " Taleniekovhad interjected . " Some targets simply are n't feasible . " " Such approval was never sought in the past . Krupskaya did not think it was based on feasibility . " " On what , then ? " " Ultimate extortion . " " How were the contacts made with this council ? " " I never knew . Neither did Aleksie . " " Someone had to make them . " THE MATARESE CIRCLE 73 " If they are alive , they will not speak . Krupskaya was right about that . " " He called it the Corsican fever . He said the answers might be in Corsica . " " It 's possible . It 's where it began , with the maniac of Corsica . Guillaume de Matarese . " " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Will you help me ? Krupskaya told me this Matarese must be  --  " " No ! " the old man had screamed . " Leave me in peace ! I 've said more than I should , admitted more than I had a right to . But only to warn you , to stop you ! The Mataresecan do no good for Russia ! Turn your back on it ! " " You 've misunderstood me . It is I who want to stop It . Them . This Matarese council . I gave my word to Aleksie that  --  " " But you 've had no words with me ! " the withered , once-powerful leader had shouted , his voice childlike in its panic . " I will deny you ever came here , deny anything you say ! You are a stranger , and I do not know you ! " Vasili had left , disturbed , perplexed . He had returned to his flat expecting to spend the night analyzing the enigmathat was the Matarese , trying to decide what to do next . As usual he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had actually taken a step away before he realized there was something inside . It was a note from his contact at the VKR , written in one of the eliptical codes they had arranged between them . The words were innocuous : an agreement to have a late dinner at 11:30 and signed with a girl 's first name . The very blandness of the note concealed its meaning . There was a problem of magnitude ; the use of eleven meant emergency . No time was to be lost making contact ; his friend would be waiting for him at the usual place . He had been there . At a piva kale near the LomonosovState University . It was a raucous drinking establishmentin tune with the new student permissiveness . They had moved to the rear of the hall ; his contact had wasted no seconds getting to the point . " Make plans , Vasili , you 're on their list . I do n't understand it but that 's the word . " 74 THE MATARESE CIRCLE " Because of the Jew ? " " Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news conference was held in New York , we division men laughed . We called it Taleniekov 's surprise . ' Even a sectionchief from Group Nine said he admired what you did ; that you taught a lesson to impetuous potato-heads . Then yesterday everything changed . What you did was no longer a joke , but rather a serious interference with basic policy . " " Yesterday ? " Vasili had asked his friend . " Late afternoon . Past four o'clock . That bitch director marched through the offices like a gorilla in heat . She smelled a gang rape and she loved it . She told each divisionman to be at her office at five o'clock . When we got there and listened , it was unbelievable . It was as if you were personally responsible for every setback we 've sustainedfor the past two years . Those maniacs from Group Nine were there , but not the section chief . " " How long have I got ? " " Three or four days at the outside . Incriminating evidenceagainst you is being compiled . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yesterday ? ... " " What happened , Vasili ? This is n't a VKR operation . It 's something else . " It was something else and Taleniekov had recognized it instantly . The yesterday in question had been the day he had seen the two former Kremlin officials who had ordered him from their homes . The something else was the Matarese . " One day I 'll tell you , my friend , " Vasili had answered . " Trust me . " " Of course . You 're the best we have . The best we 've ever had . " " Right now I need thirty-six , perhaps forty-eight hours . Do I have them ? " " I think so . They want your head , but they 'll be careful . They 'll document as much as they can . " " I 'm sure they will . One needs words to read over the corpse . Thank you . You 'll hear from me . " Vasili had not returned to his fiat , but instead to his office . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extraordinary decision . Hours before it would haveTHE MATARESE CIRCLE 75been unthinkable , but not now . If the Matarese could corruptthe highest levels of the KGB it could do the same in Washington . If the mere mention of its name called for the death of a master strategist of his rank  --  and there was no mistaking it : death was the objective  --  then the power it possessed was unthinkable . If , in truth , it was responsible for the murders of Blackburn and Yurievich , then Krupskaya was right . There was a timetable . The Matarese were closing in , the Premier or the President moving into the gunsight . He had to reach a man he loathed . He had to reach Brandon Alan Scofield , American killer . In the morning , Taleniekov had put several wheels in motion , one after the other . With his customary  --  if curtailed  --  freedom of decision , he let it be known quietly that he was traveling under cover to the Baltic Sea for a conference . He then scoured'the rolls of the Musicians Protectiveand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ago to the Ural Mountains ; he would do . Lastly , he had put the computers to work looking for a clue to the whereabouts of Brandon Scofield . The American had disappeared in Marseilles , but an incident had taken place in Amsterdam that bore the unmistakable mark of Scofield 's expertise . Vasili had sent a cipher to an agent in Brussels , a man he could trust for he had saved his life on more than one occasion . Approach Scofield , white status . Amsterdam . Contact must be made . Imperative . Stay with him . Apprise situationSouthwest Sector codes . Everything had happened rapidly , and Taleniekov was grateful for the years that made it possible for him to arrive at swift decisions . Sevastopol was less than an hour away . In Sevastopol  --  and beyond  --  those years of hard experience would be put to the test . He took a room at a small hotel on the boulevard Chersonesus and called a number at the KGB headquartersthat was not attached to a recorder ; he had installed it himself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , that much could be ascertained from headquarters ' warm greeting . An old friend had returned ; it gave Vasili the latitude he needed. 76 THE MATARESE CIRCLE " To be frank , " he said to the night duty officer , a former associate , " we have our on-going problem with VKR . They 've interfered again . You may get a teletype inquiry . You have n't heard from me , all right ? " " That 's no problem as long as you do n't show up here ; you called on the right telephone . Are you staying in cover ? " " Yes . I wo n't burden you with my whereabouts . We 're involved with a courier probe , convoys of trucks heading for Odessa , then south to the mountains . It 's a CIA network . " " That 's easier than fishing boats through the Bosporus . By the way , does Amsterdam fit into your blueprints ? " Taleniekov was startled . He had not expected so quick a reply from his man there . " It could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in two hours ago ; it took that long to break . Our cryptographer  --  the man you brought from Rigarecognizedan old code of yours . We were going to send it on to Moscow with the morning 's dispatches . " " Do n't do that , " said Vasili . " Read it to me . " " Wait a minute . " Papers were shuffled . " Here it is . ' Beowulfremoved from orbit . Storm clouds Washington . On strength of imperative will pursue and deliver white contact . Cable instructions capitol depot . ' That 's it . " " It 's enough , " said Taleniekov . " Sounds impressive , Vasili . A white contact ? You 've struck a high-level defection , I gather . Good for you . Is it tied in with your probe ? " " I think so , " lied Taleniekov . " But do n't say anything . Keep VKR out . " " With pleasure . You want us to cable for you ? " " No , " replied Vasili , " I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you this evening . Say nine-thirty ; that should be time enough . Tell my old friend from Riga I said hello . No one else , however . And thank you . " " When your probe 's over , let 's have dinner . It 's good to have you back in Sevastopol . " " It 's good to be back . We 'll talk . " Taleniekov hung up , concentrating on the message from Amsterdam . Scofield had been recalled to Washington , but the circumstances were abnormal . Beowulf Agate had run into a severe State Department storm . That fact alone was enough to propelan agent from Brussels into a transatlantic pursuit , debts notwithstanding . A white status contact was a momentaryice ; a truce generally meant that someone was about to do something drastic . And if there existed even the remote possibility that the legendary Scofield might defect , any risk was worth the candle . The man who brought in BeowulfAgate would have all of Soviet Intelligence at his feet . But defection was not possible for Scofield . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enemy was the enemy ; that would never change . Vasili picked up the phone again . There was an all-night number in the Lazarev district of the waterfront used by Greek and Iranian businessmen to send out cables to their home offices . By saying the right words , priority would be given over the existing traffic ; within several hours his cable would reach " capitol depot . " It was a hotel on Nebraska Avenue in Washington , D.C.He would meet with Scofield on neutral ground , some place where neither could take advantage of the location . Within the departure gates of an airline where the security measures were the harshest  --  West Berlin or Tel Aviv , it did not matter ; distance was inconsequential . But they had to meet , and Scofield had to be convinced of the necessity of that meeting . The cipher to Washington instructed the agent from Brussels to convey the following to Beowulf Agate . We have traded in blood very dear to both of us . In truth , I more than you but you could not know it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for international slaughter on a scale to which neither of us can subscribe . I operate outside of authority and alone . We must exchange views  --  as loathsome as it may be to both of us . Choose a neutral location , within an airport security compound . Suggest El Al , Tel Aviv or German domestic carrier , West Berlin . This courier will know how to reply . My name is known to you . It was nearly four o'clock in the morning before he closed his eyes . He had not slept in nearly three days , and when sleep came , it was deep and long . He had gone to78 THE MATARESE CIRCLEbed before there was any evidence of the sun in the eastern sky ; he awoke an hour after it had descended in the west . That was good . His mind and his body had needed the rest , and one traveled at night to the place he was going in Sevastopol . There were three hours before the duty officer arrived at KGB ; it was simpler not to involve anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the city , the better . Of course , the cryptographer knew , he had de- duced the connection from the cipher out of Amsterdam , but the man would say nothing . Taleniekov had trained him , taken a bright young man from the austerity of Riga to the freer life in Sevastopol . The time could be well spent , thought Vasili . He would eat , then make arrangements for passage in the hold of a Greek freighter that would cut straight across the sea , then follow the southern coast through the Bosporus , and on to the Dardanelles . If any of the Greek or Iranian units in the pay of the CIA or SAVAK recognized him  --  and it was possible  --  he would be entirely professional . As the previous director of the KGB sector , he had not exposed the escape route for personal reasons . However , if a musi- cian named Pietre Rydukov did not make a telephone call to Sevastopol within two days after departure , expo- sure was guaranteed , KGB reprisals to follow . It would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the route later , their talents and information worth having . Taleniekov put on the undistinguished , ill-fitting over- coat and his battered hat . A slouch and a pair of steel- rimmed spectacles were added . He checked his appearance in the mirror ; it was satisfactory . He picked up the leather violin case ; it completed his disguise , for no musi- cian left his instrument in a strange hotel room . He went out the door , down the staircase  --  never an elevator  --  and out into the Sevastopol streets . He would walk to the waterfront ; he knew where to go and what to say . Fog rolled in from the sea , curling through the beams of the floodlights on the pier . There was activity every- where as the hold of the freighter was loaded . Giant cranes swung cables cradling enormous boxcars of merchandise over the side of the ship . The loading crews were Rus- sian , supervised by Greeks . Soldiers milled about , weaponsTHE MATARESE CIRCLE 79slung casually over their shoulders , ineffectual patrols more interested in watching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to know , mused Vasili as he approached 1 the officer at the entrance gate , he could tell them . The irregularities were in the huge containers being lifted over the hull of the ship . Men and women packed in shredded cardboard , tubes from mouths to airspaces where necessary , instructions having been given to empty bladders and bowels several hours ago ; there would be no relief until well past midnight when they were at sea . The officer at the gate was a young lieutenant , bored with his work , irritation in his face . He scowled at the slouching , bespectacled old man before him . " What do you want ? The pier is off limits unless you have a pass . " He pointed to the violin case . " What 's that ? " " My livelihood , Lieutenant . I 'm with the Sevastopol Sym-phony . " " I was n't aware of any concerts scheduled for the docks . " " Your name , please ? " said Vasili casually . " What ? " Taleniekov stood up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I asked you your name , Lieutenant . " " What for ? " The officer was somewhat less hostile . Vasili removed the spectacles and looked sternly into his bewilderedeyes . " For a commendation or a reprimand . " " What are you talking about ? Who are you ? " " KGB-Sevastopol . This is part of our waterfront inspectionprogram . " The young lieutenant was politely hesitant ; he was not a fool . " I 'm afraid I was n't told , sir . I 'll have to ask you for identification . " " If you did n't , it would be the first reprimand , " said Taleniekov , reaching into his pocket for his KGB card . " The second would come if you speak of my appearance here tonight . The name , please . " The lieutenant told him , then added , " Do you people suspect trouble down here ? " He studied the plastic card and returned it . " Trouble ? " Taleniekov smiled , his eyes humorous andes " conspiratorial . " The only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a warm dinner in the company of a lady . I think the new directors in Sevastopol feel compelled to earn their rubles . You men are doing a good job ; they know that but do n't care to admit it . " Relieved , the young officer smiled back . " Thank you , sir . We do our best in a monotonous job . " " But do n't say anything about my being here , they 're serious about that . Two officers-of-the-guard were reportedlast week . " Vasili smiled again . " In the directors ' secrecy lies their true security . Their jobs . " The lieutenant grinned . " I understand . Have you a weaponin that case ? " " No . Actually it 's a very good violin . I wish I could play it . " Both men nodded knowingly . Taleniekov continued onto the pier , into the melee of machinery , dock workers and supervisors . He was looking for a specific supervisor , a Greek from Kavalla named Zaimis . Which was to say he was looking for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name was Zaimis , but whose citizenship was American . Karras Zaimis was a CIA agent , formerly station chief in Salonika , now field expediter of the escape route . Vasili knew the agent 's face from several photographs he had removed from the KGB files . He peered through the bodies and the fog and the floodlights ; he could not spot the man . Taleniekov threaded his way past rushing fork-lifts and crews of complaining laborers toward the huge cargo warehouse . Inside the enormous enclosure , the light was dim , the wire-meshed floods too high in the ceiling to do much good . Beams of flashlights crisscrossed the containers ; men were checking numbers . Vasili wondered briefly how much talent was in those boxcars . How much information was being taken out of Russia . Actually , not a great deal of either , he reminded himself . This was a minor escape route ; more comfortable accommodations were provided for serious talent and significant bearers of intelligence data . His slouch controlling his walk and his spectacles awkwardlyin place , he excused himself past a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rear of the warehouse , past stacks of cartons : end aisles blocked with freight dollies , studying the faces of those holding flashlights . He was becoming annoyed ; he did not have the time to waste . Where was Zaimis ? There had been no change of status ; the freighter was the carrier , the agent still the conduit . He had read every reportsent from Sevastopol ; there had been no mention of the escape route whatsoever . Where was he ? Suddenly Taleniekov felt a shock of pain as the barrel of a gun was shoved viciously into his right kidney . Strong fingers gripped the loose cloth of his overcoat , crunching the flesh of his lower rib cage ; he was propelledinto a deserted aisle . Words were whispered harshlyin English . " I wo n't bother speaking Greek , or trying to get through to you in Russian . I 'm told your English is as good as anyone 's in Washington . " " Conceivably better than most , " said Vasili through his ' eeth . " Zaimis ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Sevas-topol . " " I am . Where is Zaimis ? I must speak with Zaimis . " The American disregarded the question . " You 've got halls , I 'll say that for you . There 's no one from KGB withinten blocks of here . " " Are you sure about that ? " " Very . We 've got a flock of night owls out there . They see in the dark . They saw you . A violin case , Christ ! " " Do they look to the water ? " " Seagulls do that . " " You 're very well organized , all you birds . " " And you 're less bright than everyone says . What did you think you were doing ? A little personal reconnais-sance ? " Vasili felt the grip lessen on his ribs , then heard the muted sound of an object pulled out of rubber . A vial of serum . A needle . " Do n't ! " he said firmly . " Do n't do that ! Why do you think I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That 's just where you 're going . My guess would be an interrogation hospital somewhere in Virginia for about three years . " " No . You do n't understand . I have to make contact with someone . But not that way . " 82 THE MATARESE CIRCLE " Tell it to the nice doctors . They 'll listen to everything you say . " " There 's no time ! " There was no time . Taleniekov could feel the man 's weight shift ; in seconds a needle would puncture his clothes and enter his flesh . It could not happenthis way ! He could not deal with Scofield officially ! None dare talk . The admissions would be catastrophic . for governments everywhere . The Matarese . If he could be destroyed in Moscow , the Americans would not think twice about silencing him . Vasili raised his right shoulder  --  a gesture of pain from the gun barrel in his kidney . The gun was abruptly pressed further into his back  --  a reaction to the gesture . In that split instant , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heel of the palm , not the index finger . Taleniekov 's movement was timed for it . He spun to his left , his arm arcing up , crashing down over the American 's elbow , vicing it into his hip until the forearm cracked . He jabbed the fingers of his right hand into the man 's throat , bruising the windpipe . The gun fell to the floor , its clatter obscured by the din of the warehouse . Vasili picked it up and shoved the CIA agent against a boxcar container . In his pain , the American held the hypodermic needle limply in his left hand ; it , too , dropped to the floor . His eyes were glazed , but not beyondcognizance . " Now , you listen to me , " said Taleniekov , his face against Zaimis ' face . " I 've known about ' Operation Dardanelles ' for nearly seven months . I know you 're Zaimis . You deal in mediocre traffic ; you 're not significant . But that 's not the reason I did n't blow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of use to me . That time has come . You can accept it or not . " " Taleniekov defect ? " said Zaimis , holding his throat . " No way . You 're Soviet poison . A double entry , but no defec-tor . " " You 're right . I do not defect . And if that unthinkable option ever entered my mind , I 'd contact the British , or the French before you . I said I wanted to get out of Russia , not betray it . " " You 're lying , " said the American , his hand slipping down to the lapel of his heavy cloth jacket . " You can go anywhere you want . " THE MATARESE CIRCLE 83 " Not at the moment , I 'm afraid . There are complica-tions . " " What did you do , turn capitalist ? Make off with a couple of pouches ? " " Come on , Zaimis . Which of us does n't have his small box of resources ? Often legitimate ; funneled monies can he delayed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is too unstable . I 'd guess Berlin or London . Mine 's quite ordinary : certificates of deposit , Chase Manhattan , New York City . " The CIA man 's expression remained passive , his thumb curled beneath his jacket 's lapel . " So you got caught , " he said absently . " We 're wasting time ! " Vasili barked . " Get me to the Dardanelles . I 'll make my own way from there . If you do n't , if a telephone call is not received here in Sevastopol when expected , your operation is finished . You 'll be  --  " Zaimis ' hand shot up toward his mouth ; Taleniekov grabbed the agent 's fingers and twisted them violently outward . Stuck to the American 's thumb was a small tablet . " You damn fool ! What do you think you 're doing ? ! " Zaimis winced , the pain excruciating . " I 'd rather go this way than in the Lubyanka . " " You ass ! If anyone goes to the Lubyanka , it will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at their desks in Moscow . And fools  --  just like you  --  who would prefer a tablet rather than listen to the truth ! You want to die , I 'll accommodate you . But first get me to the Dardanelles ! " The agent , breathing with difficulty , stared at Taleniekov . Vasili released his hand , removing the tablet from Zaimis ' thumb . " You 're for real , are n't you ? " Zaimis said . " I 'm for real . Will you help me ? " " I have n't got anything to lose , " said the agent . " You 'll be on our carrier . " " Do n't forget . Word must get back here from the Dardanelles . If it does n't , you 're finished . " Zaimis paused , then nodded . " Check . We trade off . " " We trade off , " agreed Taleniekov . " Now , can you get me to a telephone ? " 84 THE MATARESE CIRCLEThe cinderblock cubicle in the warehouse had two phones  --  installed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for intercepts , thought Vasili . They would be sterile ; he could talk . The Americanagent picked up his when Taleniekow finished dialing . The instant the call was answered , Vasili spoke . " Is this you , my old comrade ? " It was and it was not . It was not the station chief he had spoken with earlier ; instead , it was the cryptographer Taleniekov had trained years ago in Riga and brought to Sevastopol . The man 's voice was low , anxious . " Our mutual friend was called to the code room ; it was arranged . I said I 'd wait for your call . I have to see you right away . Where are you ? " Zaimis reached over , his bruised fingers gripping the mouthpiece of Vasili 's phone . Taleniekov shook his head ; in spite of the fact that he trusted the cryptographer , he had no intention of answering the question . " That 's of no consequence . Did the cable come from depot ' ? " " A great deal more than that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " pressed Vasili . " Yes . But it 's not in any cipher I 've ever heard of . Nothing you and I ever used before . Neither during our years in Riga nor here . " " Read it to me . " " There 's something else , " insisted the code man , his tone now intense . " They 're after you openly . I recycled the teletype to Moscow for in-house confirmation and burnt the original . It will be back in less than two hours . I ca n't believe it . I wo n't believe it ! " " Calm down . What was it ? " " There 's an alert out for you from the Baltic to the Manchurian borders . " " VKR ? " asked Vasili , alarmed but controlled ; he expectedGroup Nine to act swiftly but not quite this swiftly . " Not just VKR . KGB  --  and every intelligence station we have ! As well as all military units . Everywhere . This is n't you they speak of ; it could n't be . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " That you 've betrayed the State . You 're to be taken , THE MATARESE CIRCLE 85but there 's to be no detention , no interrogation at all . You 're to be . . . executed . . . without delay . " " I see , " said Taleniekov . And he did see ; he expected it . It was not the VKR . It was powerful men who 'd heard he had spoken a name that no one should hear . Matarese . " I 've betrayed no one . Believe that . " " I do . I know you . " " Read me the cable from depot ' " " Very well . Have you a pencil ? It makes no sense . " Vasili reached into his pocket for his pen ; there was paper on the table . " Go ahead . " The man spoke slowly , clearly . " As follows : Invitation Kasimir . Schrankenwarten five goals ' . . . . " The cryptographerstopped ; Taleniekov could hear voices in the distance over the line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming , " he said . " I must have the rest of that cable ! " " Thirty minutes . The Amar Magazin . I 'll be there . " The line went dead . Vasili slammed his fist on the table , then replaced the phone . " I must have it , " he repeated in English . " What 's the Amar Magazin  --  the Lobster Shop ? " asked the CIA man . " A fish restaurant on Kerenski Street , about seven blocks from headquarters . No one who knows Sevastopol goes there ; the food is terrible . But it fits what he was trying to tell me . " " What 's that ? " " Whenever the cryptographer wanted me to screen certainincoming material before others saw it , he would suggest we meet at the Amar . " " He did n't just come to your office and talk ? " Taleniekov glanced over at the American . " You know better than that . " The agent looked hard at Vasili . " They want you very dead , do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " It always is , " said Zaimis , frowning . " You trust him ? " " You heard him . When do you sail ? " " Eleven-thirty . Two hours . Roughly the same time that confirmation 's due back from Moscow . " " I 'll be here . " " I know you will , " said the agent . " Because I 'm going with you . " 86 THE MATARESE CIRCLE " You what ? " " I 've got protection out there in the city . Of course , I 'll want my gun back . And yours . We 'll see how much you want to get through the Bosporus . " " Why would you do this ? " " I have an idea you may reconsider that unthinkable option of yours . I want to bring you in . " Vasili shook his head slowly . " Nothing ever changes . It will not happen . I can still expose you and you do n't know how . And by exposing you , I blow apart your Black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Time is always the issue , is n't it ? " " We 'll see . You want to get to the Dardanelles ? " " Of course . " " Give me the gun , " said the American . The restaurant was filled , the waiters ' aprons as di as the sawdust on the floor . Taleniekov sat alone by t right rear wall , Zaimis two tables away in the compan , of a Greek merchant seaman in the pay of the CI The Greek 's face was creased with loathing for his sur roundings . Vasili sipped iced vodka which helped disguise the taste of the fifth-rate caviar . The cryptographer came through the door , spottTaleniekov , and weaved his way awkwardly betwwaitersand patrons to the table . His eyes behind the thi lenses of his glasses conveyed at once joy and fear and A , hundred unspoken questions . " It 's all so incredible , " he said , sitting down . " What have they done to you ? " " It 's what they 're doing to themselves , " replied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't want to h  --  . what has to be said , what has to be stopped . It 's all I c. tell you . " " But to call for your execution . It 's inconceivable ! " " Do n't worry , old friend . I 'll be back  --  and , as they say  --  rehabilitated with honors . " Taleniekov smiled and touched the man 's arm . " Never forget . There are good and decent men in Moscow , more committed to their country than to their own fears and ambitions . They 'll always be there , and those are the men that I will reach . They 'll welcome me and thank me for what I 've done . THE MATARESE CIRCLE 87Believe that .... Now , we 're dealing in minutes . Where Is the cable ? " The cryptographer opened his hand . The paper was neatly folded , creased into his palm . " I wanted to be able to throw it away , if I had to . I know the words . " He handed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he read the messagefrom Washington . Invitation Kasimir . Schrankenwarten five goals , Unterden Linden . Przseslvac zero . Prague . Repeat text . Zero . Repeat again at will . Zero . Beowulf Agate . When he had finished reading , the former master strategistof KGB whispered , " Nothing ever changes . " " What is it ? " asked the cryptographer . " I did n't understand it . It 's no code we 've ever used . " " There 's no way that you could understand , " answered Vasili , anger and sadness in his voice . " It 's a combination of two codes . Ours and theirs . Ours from the days in East Berlin , theirs from Prague . This cable was not tent by our man from Brussels . It was sent by a killer who wo n't stop killing . " It happened so fast there were only seconds to react , and the Greek seaman moved first . His weathered face had been turned toward the incoming customers . He spat out the words . " Watch it ! The goats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spun in his chair . Twenty feet away , in an aisle peopled by waiters , were two men who had not come in for a meal ; their expressionswere set , their eyes darting about the room . They were scanning the tables but not for friends . " Oh , my God , " whispered the cryptographer turning back to Vasili . " They found the phone and tapped it . I was afraid of that . " " Followed you , yes , " said Taleniekov , glancing over at Zaimis , who was half out of his chair , the idiot . " They know we 're friends ; you 're being watched . But they did n't find the phone . If they were certain that I was here , they 'd break in with a dozen soldiers . They 're district88 THE MATARESE CIRCLEVKR . I know them . Calmly now , take off your hat and slide out of your chair . Head toward the back hallway , to the men 's room . There 's a rear exit , remember ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man . He got up , his shoulders hunched , and started for the narrow corridor several tables away . But he was an academic , not a field man , and Vasili cursed himself for trying to instruct him . One of the two VKR men spotted him and came forward , pushing ' aside the waiters in the aisle . Then he saw Taleniekov and his hand whipped into the open space of his jacket and toward an unseen weapon . As he did so , the Greek seaman lurched up from his chair , weaving unsteadily , waving his arms like a man with too much vodka in him . He slammed against the VKR man , who tried to push him away . The Greek feigned ' drunken indignation and pushed back with such force that the Russian went sprawling over a table , sending , dishes and food crashing to the floor . Vasili sprang up and raced past his old friend from ; Riga , pulling him toward the narrow hallway ; then he ' saw the American . Zaimis was on his feet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that away ! " shouted Taleniekov . " Do n't expose  --  ' It was too late . A gunshot exploded through the soma .. eof chaos , escalating it instantly into pandemonium . The CIA man brought both his hands to his chest as he fell , : the shirt beneath his jacket suddenly drenched with blood . Vasili grabbed the cryptographer by the shoulder , , yanking him through the narrow archway . There was a second gunshot ; the code man arched spastically , his legs together , an eruption of flesh at his throat . He had been shot through the back of the neck . Taleniekov lunged to the floor of the hallway , stunned at what followed . He heard a third gunshot , a shrill , scream after it , penetrating the cacophony of screa : surrounding it . And then the Greek seaman crashes . through the archway , an automatic in his hand . " Is there a way out back here ? " he roared in broke* English . " We have to run . The first goat got away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his feet and gestured for the Greek to follow him . Together they raced through a doorTHE MATARESE CIRCLE 89 into a kitchen filled with terrified cooks and waiters , ind out into an alley . They turned left and ran through amaze of dark connecting pavements between the old buildingsuntil they reached the back streets of Sevastopol . They kept running for more than a mile . Vasili knew every inch of the city , but it was the Greek who kept shouting the turns they must make . As they entered a dimly lit side street , the seaman grabbed Taleniekov 's arm ; the man was out of breath . " We can rest here for a minute , " he said , gasping . " They wo n't find us . " " It 's not a place we think of first in a search , " agreed Vasili , looking at the row of neat apartment buildings . " Always hide out in a well-kept neighborhood , " said the seaman . " The residents veer from controversy ; they 'd inform on you in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look in such places . " " You say we can stay ' for a minute , ' " said Taleniekov . " I 'm not sure where we 'll go after that . I need time to think . " " You rule out the ship then ? " asked the Greek . " I thought so . " " Yes . Zaimis had papers on him . Worse , he had one of my guns . The VKR will be swarming over the piers within the hour . " The Greek studied Vasili in the dim light . " So the greatTaleniekov flees Russia . He can remain only as a corpse . " " Not from Russia , only from frightened men . But Ido have to leave  --  for a while . I 've got to figure out how . " " There is a way , " said the merchant seaman simply . " We 'll head over the northwest coast , then south into the mountains . You 'll be in Greece in three days . " " How ? " " There 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard bench in the back of the truck , the light of dawn seeping through the billowing canvas flaps that covered the sides . In a while , he and the ethers would have to crawl beneath the floor boards , renainingmotionless and silent on a concealed ledge be- ! ' een the axles , while they passed through the next check-90 THE MATARESE CIRCLEpoint . But for an hour or so they could stretch and breathe air that did not reek of oil and grease . He reached into his pocket and took out the cipher from Washington , the cable that had already cost threelives . Invitation Kasimir . Schrankenwarten five goals . Unterden Linden . Przseslvac zero . Prague . Repeat text . Zero . Repeat again at will . Zero . Beowulf Agate . Two codes . One meaning . With his pen , Vasili wrote out that meaning beneath the cipher . Come and take me , as you took someone else across a checkpoint at five o'clock on the Unter den Linden . I 've broken and killed your courier , as anothercourier was killed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll kill you . ScofieldBeyond the American killer 's brutal decision , the most electrifying aspect of Scofield 's cable was the fact that he was no longer in the service of his country . He had been separated from the intelligence community . And consideringwhat he had done and the pathological forces that drove him to do it , the separation was undoubtedly savage . For no government professional would murder a courier under the circumstances of this extraordinary Soviet contact . And if Scofield was nothing else , he was a professional . The storm clouds over Washington had been catastrophicfor Beowulf Agate . They had destroyed him . As the storm over Moscow had destroyed a master strategistnamed Taleniekov . It was strange , bordering on the macabre . Two ene  --  ' mies who loathed each other had been chosen by the Matarese as the first of its lethal decoys  --  ploys and diversionsas old Krupskaya had called them . Yet only one of those enemies knew it ; the other did not . He was concernedsolely with ripping scars open , letting the blood between them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back into his pocket , and breathed deeply . The coming days would be filled with move and countermove , two experts stalking each other until the Inevitable confrontation . My name is Taleniekov . We will kill each other or we will talk. 7Undersecretary of State Daniel Congdon shot up from the chair , the telephone in his hand . Since his early days at NSA he had learned that one way of controlling an outburst was to physically move during a moment of crisis . And control was the key to everything in his profession ; at least , the appearance of it . He listened as this particular crisis was defined by an angry Secretary of State . Godamn it , he was controlled . " I 've just met privately with the Soviet Ambassador and we both agree the incident must not be made public . The important thing now is to bring Scofield in . " " Are you certain it was Scofield , sir ? I ca n't believe it ! " " Let 's say that until he denies it with irrefutable proof that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we must assume it had to be Scofield . No one else in clandestine operations would have committed such an act . It 's unthinkable . " Unthinkable ? Incredible . The body of a dead Russian delivered through the gates of the Soviet Embassy in the back seat of a Yellow Cab at 8:30 in the morning at the height of Washington 's rush-hour traffic . And a driver who knew absolutely nothing except that he had picked up two drunks , not one  --  although one was in worse shape than the other . What the hell had happened to the other guy ? The one who sounded like a Ruskie and wore a hat and dark glasses and said the sunlight was too bright after a whole night of Wodka . Where was he ? And was the fellow in the back seat all right ? He looked like a mess. 92 THE MATARESE CIRCLE " Who was the man , Mr. Secretary ? " " He was a Soviet intelligence officer stationed in Brussels . The Ambassador was frank ; the KGB had no knowledge ' he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " There 's no evidence whatsoever to support that . " " Then what ties him to Scofield ? Beyond the method of dispatch and delivery . " The Secretary of State paused , then replied carefully . " You must understand , Mr. Congdon , the Ambassador and I have a unique relationship that goes back several decades . We are often more candid with each other than diplomatic . Always with the understanding that neither speaks for the record . " " I understand , sir , " said Congdon , realizing that the answerabout to be given could never be referred to officially . " The intelligence officer in question was a member of a KGB unit in East Berlin roughly ten years ago . I assume in light of your recent decisions that you 're familiar with Scofield 's file . " " His wife ? " Congdon sat down . " The man was one of those who killed Scofield 's wife ? " " The Ambassador made no reference to Scofield 's wife ; he merely mentioned the fact that the dead man had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ East Berlin ten years ago . " " That section was controlled by a strategist named Taleniekov . He gave the orders . " " Yes , " said the Secretary of State . " We discussed Mr. Taleniekov and the subsequent incident several years later in Prague at some length . We looked for the connectionyou 've just considered . It may exist . " " How is that , sir ? " " Vasili Taleniekov disappeared two days ago . " " Disappeared ? " " Yes , Mr. Congdon . Think about it . Taleniekov learned that he was to be officially retired , mounted a simple but effective cover , and disappeared . " " Scofield 's been terminated . . . . " Congdon spoke softly , as much to himself as into the telephone . " Exactly , " agreed the Secretary of State . " The parallel is our immediate concern . Two retired specialists now bent on doing what they could not do  --  or pursue  --  ofTHEMATARESE CIRCLE 93 flcially . Kill each other . They have contacts everywhere , men who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Their personal vendetta could create untold problemsfor both governments during these precious months of conciliation . This can not happen . The director of Cons Op frowned ; there was something wrong in the secretary 's conclusions . " I spoke with Scofieldmyself three nights ago . He did n't appear conslimedwith anger or revenge or anything like that . He was a tired field agent who 'd lived . abnormally ... for a long time . For years . He told me he just wanted to fade away , and I believed him . I discussed Scofieldwith Robert Winthrop , by the way , and he felt the same way about him . He said  --  " " Winthrop knows nothing , " interrupted the Secretary of State with unexpected harshness . " Robert Winthrop is abrilliant man , but he 's never understood the meaning of confrontation except in its most rarefied forms . Bear inmind , Mr. Congdon , Scofield killed that intelligence officerfrom Brussels . " " Perhaps there were circumstances we 're not aware of . " " Really ? " Again the Secretary of State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his words was unmistakable . " If there are such circumstances , I submit we have a far more potentially dangerous situation than any personal 1 end might engender . Scofield and Taleniekov know more about the field operations of both intelligence services than any two men alive . They must not be permitted to make contact . Either as enemies intent on killing one another , or for those circumstances we know nothing about . Do I make myself clear , Mr. Congdon ? As director of Consular Operations , it is your responsibility . How you execute that responsibility is no concern of mine . You may have a man beyond salvage . That 's for you to decide . " Daniel Congdon remained motionless as he heard the click on the other end of the line . In all his years of servicehe had never received such an ill-disguised if oblique order . The language could be debated , not the command . He replaced the phone in its cradle and reached foranother on the left side of his desk . He pressed a button and dialed three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice. 94 THE MATARESE CIRCLE " This is Undersecretary Congdon . Pick up Brandon Scofield . You have the information . Bring him in at once . " " One minute , sir , " replied the man politely . " I think a level-two surveillance entry on Scofield came in a couple of days ago . Let me check the computer . All the data 's there . " " A couple of days ago ? " " Yes , sir . It 's on the screen now . Scofield checked out of his hotel at approximately eleven P.M. on the six-teenth . " " The sixteenth ? Today 's the nineteenth . " " Yes , sir . There was no time lapse as far as the entry was concerned . The management informed us within the hour . " " Where is he ? " " He left two forwarding addresses , but no dates . A sister'sresidence in Minneapolis and a hotel in Charlotte Amalie , St. Thomas , U.S. Virgin Islands . " " Have they been verified ? " " As to accuracy , yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hotel in St. Thomas is holding a prepaid reservationfor Scofield effective the seventeenth . The money was wired from Washington . " " Then he 's there . " " Not as of noon today , sir . A routine call was made ; he has n't arrived . " " What about the sister ? " interrupted Congdon . " Again a routine call . She confirmed the fact that Scofieldcalled her and said he 'd stop by , but he did n't say when . She added that it was n't unusual ; it was normal for him to be casual about visits . She expected him sometimeduring the week . " The director of Cons Op felt the urge to get up again , but he suppressed it . " Are you telling me you do n't really know where he is ? " " Well , Mr. Congdon , an S-level-two operates on reports received , not continuous visual contact . We 'll shift to level-one right away . Minneapolis wo n't be any problem ; the Virgin Islands could be , though . " " Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sir . Nobody does . " Daniel Congdon got up from his chair . " Let me try to unTHEMATARESE CIRCLE 95stand you . You say Scofield 's on a level-two surveilice , yet my instructions were clear ; his whereabouts cre to be known at all times . Why was n't a level-one put en him ? Why was n't continuous visual contact maintained ? " The man from Internal Security answered haltingly . " That would n't be my decision , sir , but I think I can understand it . If a level-one was put on Scofield , he 'd spot it and . . . well , sheer perversity would make him mislead us . " " What the hell do you think he 's just done ? Find him ! Report your progress hourly to this office ! " Congdon sat down angrily , replacing the phone with such force that it jarred the bell . He stared at the instrument , picked it up , and dialed again . " Overseas Communications , Miss Andros , " said the woman 's voice . " Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cipher specialist to my office immediately . ClassificationCode A maximum security and priority . " " An emergency , sir ? " " Yes , Miss Andros , an emergency . The cable will be sent in thirty minutes . Clear all traffic to Amsterdam , Marseilles ... and Prague . " Scofield heard the footsteps in the hallway and got out of the chair . He walked to the door and peered through the tiny disk in the center . The figure of a man passed by ; he did not stop at the door across the way , the entrance to the suite of rooms used by Taleniekov 's courier . Bray went back to the chair and sat down . He leaned his head against the rim , staring at the ceiling . It had been three days since the race in the streets , three nights since he 'd taken the messenger from Taleniekov  --  messengerthree nights ago , killer on the Unter den Linden ten years before . It had been a strange night , an odd race , a finish that might have been otherwise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kill him had gradually lost its urgency for Bray , as so much had lost urgency . The courier had brought it upon himself . The Soviet had gone into panic and pulled out a four-inch , razor-sharp blade from the recesses of the hotel chair and attacked . His death was due to Scofield 's reaction ; it was not the premeditated murder planned in the street. 96 THE MATARESE CIRCLENothing ever changed much . The KGB courier had been used by Taleniekov . The man was convinced that Beowulf Agate was coming over , and the Russian who brought him in would be given the brassiest medal in Moscow . " You 've been tricked , " Bray had told the courier . " Impossible ! " the Soviet had yelled . " It 's Taleniekov ! " " It certainly is . And he chooses a man from the Unter den Linden to make contact , a man whose face he knows I 'll never forget . The odds were that I 'd lose control and kill you . In Washington . I 'm exposed , vulnerable ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're wrong ! It 's a white contact ! " " So was East Berlin , you son of a bitch . " " What are you going to do ? " " Earn some of my severance pay . You 're coming in . " " No ! " " Yes . " The man had lunged at Scofield . Three days had passed since that moment of violence , three mornings since Scofield had deposited the package at the embassy and sent the cipher to Sevastopol . Still no one had come to the door across the hall ; and that was not normal . The suite was leased by a brokerage house in Bern , Switzerland , to be available for its " executives . " Standard procedure for international businessmen , and also a transparent cover for a Soviet drop . Bray had forced the issue . The cipher and the courier'sdead body had to provoke someone into checking the suite of rooms . Yet no one had ; it did not make sense . Unless part of Taleniekov 's cable was true : he was actingalone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one explanation : the Soviet killer had been terminated , and before retiring to an isolated life somewhere in the vicinity of Grasnov , he had decided to settle an outstandingdebt . He had sworn to do so after Prague ; the message had been clear : You 're mine , Beowulf Agate . Someday , somewhere . I'ii see you take your last breath . A brother for a wife . The husband for the brother . It was vengeance rooted in loathing and that loathing never left . There 'd be no peace for either of them until the end came for one . It was better to know that now , thoughtTHE MATARESE CIRCLE 97 itBray , rather than find out on a crowded street or a desertedstretch of beach , with a knife in the side or a bullet in the head . The courier 's death was an accident , Taleniekov 's would not be . There would be no peace until they met , and then death would come  --  one way or the other . It was a question now of drawing the Russian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the stalker , the role established . kThe strategy was classic : tracks clearly defined for the stalker to follow , and at the chosen moment  --  least expected  --  thetracks would not be there , the stalker bewildered , exposed  --  the trap sprung . Like Bray , Taleniekov could travel anywhere he wished , with or without official sanction . Over the years , both had learned too many methods ; a plethora of false papers were out there for purchase , hundreds of men everywhere ready to provide concealment or transportation , cover or weapons  --  any and all . There were only two basic requirements : identities and money . Neither he nor Taleniekov lacked either . Both came with the profession , the identities quite naturally , the moneyless so  --  more often than not the result of having been hung by bureaucratic delays in the forwarding of payments demanded . Every specialist worth his rank had his own personal sources of funds . Payments exaggerated , monies diverted and deposited in stable territories . The objective was neither theft nor wealth , merely survival @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burned once or twice to learn the necessity of economic back-ups . Bray had accounts under various names in Paris , Munich , London , Geneva and Lisbon . One avoided Rome and the Communist bloc ; the Italian Treasury was madness , and banking in the Eastern satellites too corrupt . Scofield rarely thought about the money that was his for the spending ; in the back of his mind he supposed he would give it back one day . Had the predatory Congdonnot flirted with his own temptations and made the officialtermination so complicated , Bray might have walked in the next morning and handed him the bankbooks . Not now . The undersecretary 's actions ruled it out . One did not hand over several hundred thousand dollars to a man who tried to orchestrate one 's elimination while remainingoutside the act itself . It was a very professional98 THE MATARESE CIRCLEconcept . Scofield recalled that years ago it had been brought to its zenith by the killers of the Matarese . But they were assassins for hire ; there 'd been no one like them in centuries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be no one like them ever again , and someonelike Daniel Congdon was a pale joke in comparison . Congdon . Scofield laughed and reached into his pocket for his cigarettes . The new director of Consular Operationswas not a fool and only a fool would underestimate him , but he had the upper-Washington mentality so prevalentin the management of clandestine services . He did not really understand what being in the field did to a man ; he might mouth the phrases , but he did not see the simple line of action and reaction . Few did , or wanted to , because to recognize it meant admitting knowledge of abnormality in a subordinate whose function the department  --  orthe Company  --  could not do without . Quite simply , pathological behavior was a perfectly normal way of life for a field man , and no particular attention was paid to it . The man in the field accepted the fact that he was a criminal before any crimes had been committed . Therefore , at the first hint of activity he took measures to protecthimself before anything happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . While the messenger from Taleniekov had been seated across the room in the hotel on Nebraska Avenue , Scofield had made several calls . The first was to his sister in Minneapolis : he was flying out to the Midwest in a couple of hours and would see her in a day or so . The second was to a friend in Marylandwho was a deep sea fisherman with a roomful of stuffed victims and trophies on the walls : where was a good , small place in the Caribbean that would take him on short notice ? The friend had a friend in Charlotte Amalie ; he owned a hotel and always kept two or three rooms open for just such emergencies . The fisherman from Maryland would call him for Bray . So , for all intents and purposes , as of the night of the sixteenth , he was en route to the Midwest . . . or the Caribbean . Both more than fifteen hundred miles from Washington  --  where he remained unobserved , never leaving the hotel room across the hall from the Soviet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lesson into younger , less experienced field agents ? Too many times to count . A man standing motionless in a crowd was difficult to spot . But every hour escalated the complexity . All possible explanations had to be examined . The most obvious was that the Russian had activated a dormant drop known to him and his messenger ; instructions could be sent quietly to Bern , the suite of rooms leased by cable . It would take weeks before the information was filtered back to Moscow  --  one drop among thousands around the world . If so  --  and it was perhaps the only explanation  --  Taleniekovwas not merely acting alone , he was acting in conflict with KGB interests . His vendetta superseded his allegiance to his government , if the term had meaning any longer ; it had little for Scofield . It was the only explanation . Otherwisethe suite of rooms across the hall would be swarming with Soviets . They might wait twenty-four or thirty-six hours to check out FBI observation , but no more than that ; there were too many ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gut instinct that he was right , an instinct developed over the years to the point where he trusted it implicitly . Now he had to put himself into Taleniekov 's place , think as Vasili Taleniekov would think . It was his protection against a knife in the side or a bullet from a high-powered rifle . It was the way to bring it all to an end , and not have to go through each day wondering what the shadows held . Or the crowds . The KGB man had no choice : it was his move and it had to be in Washington . One started with the physical connection and it was the dormant drop across the hall . In a matter of days  --  perhaps hours now  --  Taleniekov would fly into Dulles Airport and the hunt would begin . But the Russian was no idiot ; he would not walk into a trap . Instead , another would come , someone who knew nothing , who had been paid to be an unknowing decoy . An unsuspecting passenger whose friendship was carefullycultivated on a transatlantic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had used in Washington . Men and women who had no idea that the European they did well-paid favors for was a strategist for KGB . i ! Among them would be the decoy , or decoys , and the birds . Decoys knew nothing ; they were bait . Birds100 THE MATARESE CIRCLEwatched , sending out alarms when the bait was being taken . Birds and decoys ; they would be Teleniekov 's weapons . Someone would come to the hotel on Nebraska Avenue . Whoever it was would have no instructions beyond getting into those rooms ; no telephone number , no name that meant anything . And nearby , the birds would be waiting for the quarry to go after the bait . When the quarry was spotted the birds would reach the hunter . Which meant that the hunter was also nearby . This would be Taleniekov 's strategy , for no other was available ; it was also the strategy that Scofield would use . Three or four  --  five at the outside  --  persons readily availablefor such employment . Simply mounted : phone calls placed at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An inexpensive exercise considering the personal value of the quarry . Sounds came from beyond the door . Voices . Bray got out of the chair and walked quickly to the tiny glass circlein the panel . Across the hall a well-dressed woman was talking with the bell captain who carried her overnight bag . Not a suitcase , not luggage from a transatlantic flight , but a small overnight case . The decoy had arrived , the birds not far away . Taleniekov had landed ; it had started . The woman and the bell captain disappeared into the suite of rooms . Scofield walked to the telephone . It was the moment to begin the counterexercise . He needed time ; two or three days were not out of the question . He called the deep-sea fisherman on the Maryland shore , making sure to dial direct . He capped the mouthpiecewith his right hand , filtering his voice through his barely separated fingers . The greeting was swift , the caller in a hurry . " I 'm in the Keys and ca n't reach that damned hotel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? Tell them I 'm on a charter out of Tavernier and will be there in a couple of days . " " Sure , Bray . On a real vacation , are n't you ? " " More than you know . And thanks . " The next call needed no such artifice . It was to a Frenchwomanhe had lived with briefly in Paris several years ago . She had been one of the most effective undercover personnelat Interpol until her cover was blown ; she workedTHE MATARESE CIRCLE 101now for a CIA proprietary based in Washington . There was no sexual attraction between them any Ionger but they were friends . She asked no questions . He gave her the name of the hotel on Nebraska Avenue . " Call in fifteen minutes and ring suite two-eleven . A woman will answer . Ask for me . " " Will she be furious , darling ? " " She wo n't know who I am . But someone else will . " Taleniekov leaned against the brick of the dark alleywayacross from the hotel . For several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back and forth , trying to ease the tension , reduce the exhaustion . He had been travelingfor nearly three days , flying for more than eighteenhours , driving into cities and villages finding those men who would provide him with false documents that would get him through three immigration stations . From Salonika to Athens , Athens to London , London to New York . Finally a late afternoon shuttle flight to Washingtonafter visits to three banks in lower Manhattan . He had made it ; his people were in place . An expensivewhore he 'd brought from New York and three others from Washington , two men and an older woman . All but one were well-spoken nichivo , what the Americanscalled hustlers . Each had performed services in the past for the generous " businessman " from The Hague , who had a proclivity for checking up on his associates and a penchant for confidence , both of which he paid for in large sums . They were primed for their evening 's employment . The whore was in the suite of rooms that was the Bern-Washingtondepot ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was no amateur ; he would receive the news  --  from a desk clerk or switchboard operator  --  and send another to question the girl . Whoever it was would be seen by one or all of Taleniekov'sbirds . The two men and the older woman . He had provided each with a miniaturized walkie-talkie no largerthan a hand-held recorder ; he had purchased four at the Mitsubi complex on Fifth Avenue . They could reach him instantly , unobtrusively . Except the whore . No risk could be taken that such a device would be found on her . She was expendable. 102 THE MATARESE CIRCLEOne of the two men sat in a booth in the dimly lit cocktail lounge with small candle lanterns on each table . Beside him was an open attache case , papers pulled out and placed under candlelight ; a salesman summarizing the events of a business trip . The other man was in the dining room , the table set for two , the reservation made by a highly placed aide at the White House . The host was delayed ; several apologetic calls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be treated as befitted one receivingsuch apologies from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue . But it was the older woman Taleniekov counted on most ; she was paid well above the others and with good reason . She was not a nichivo at all . She was a killer . His unexpected weapon . A gracious , articulate woman who had no compunction about firing a weapon into a targetacross the room , or plunging a knife into the stomach of a dinner companion . Who could , on a moment 's notice , change her appearance from the dignified to the harridan  --  and all shades in between . Vasili had paid her thousands over the past half-dozen years , several times having flown her to Europe for chores that suited her extraordinary talents . She had not failed him ; she would not fail him tonight . He had reached her soon after landing at Kennedy Airport ; she had had a full day to prepare for the evening . It was sufficient . Taleniekov pushed himself away from the brick wall , shaking his fingers , breathing deeply , forcing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his flanks ; now he could only wait . If Scofield wanted to keep the appointment  --  inthe American 's judgment , fatal to one of them . And why would n't he ? It was better to get it over with rather than be obsessed with every patch of darkness or each crowded street in sunlight , wondering who might be concealed . . . taking aim , unsheathing a knife . No , it was far more desirable to conclude the hunt ; that would be Beowulf Agate 's opinion . And yet , how wrong he was ! If there was only some way to reach him , tell him ! There was the Mataresel There were people to see , to appeal to , to convince ! Together they could do it ; there were decent men in Moscow and Washington , men who would not be afraid . But there was no way to reach Brandon Scofield on neutral ground , for no ground would be neutral to Beo- ' THE MATARESE CIRCLE 103waif Agate . At the first sight of his enemy , the American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that enemy away . Vasili understood , for if he were Scofield , he would do the same . So it was a question of waiting , circling , knowing that each thought the other was the quarry who would expose himself first ; each maneuveringto cause his adversary to make that mistake . The terrible irony was that the only significant mistakewould come about if Scofield won . Taleniekov could not let that happen . Wherever Scofield was , he had to be taken , immobilized , forced to listen . Which was why the waiting was so important now . And the master strategist of East Berlin and Riga and Sevastopol was an expert in patience . " The waiting paid off , Mr. Congdon , " said the excited voice over the phone . " Scofield 's on a charter out of Tavernierin the Florida Keys . We estimate he 'll arrive in the Virgin Islands the day after tomorrow . " " What 's the source of your information ? " asked the Director of Consular Operations apprehensively , clearing the sleep from his throat , squinting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three in the morning . " The hotel in Charlotte Amalie . " " What 's the source of their information ? " " They received an overseas call asking that the reservationbe held . That he 'd be there in two days . " " Who made the call ? Where did it come from ? " There was a pause on the other end of the State Departmentline . " We assume Scofield . From the Keys . " " Do n't assume . Find out . " " We 're confirming everything , of course . Our man in Key West is on his way to Tavernier now . He 'll check out all the charter logs . " " Check out that phone call . Let me know . " Congdon bung up and raised himself on the pillow . He looked over at his wife on the twin bed next to him . She had pulled the sheet over her head . The years had taught her to sleep through the all-night calls . He thought about the one he had just received . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the haze of casual , **26;6672;TOOLONG ; an exhausted man getting away for a while . But there was the contradiction : Scofield was not a104 THE MATARESE CIRCLEman ever exhausted to the point of being casual about anything . He had deliberately obscured his movements . . . which meant he had killed the intelligence officer from Brussels . KGB . Brussels . Taleniekov . East Berlin . Taleniekov and the man from Brussels had worked together in East Berlin . In a " relatively autonomous sectionof KGB "  --  which means East Berlin . . . and beyond . In Washington ? Had that " relatively autonomous " unit from East Berlin sent men to Washington ? It was not unreasonable . The word " autonomous " had two meanings . Not only was it designed to absolve superiors from certainacts of their subordinates but it signified freedom of movement . A CIA agent in Lisbon might track a man to Athens . Why not ? He was familiar with an operation . Conversely , a KGB agent in London would follow an , espionage suspect to New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of duty . Taleniekov had operated in Washington ; there was speculation that he had made a dozen trips or more to the United States within the past decade . Taleniekov and the man from Brussels ; that was the connection they had to examine . Congdon sat forward and reached for the telephone , then stopped . Timing was everything now . The cables had been received in Amsterdam , Marseilles and Prague nearly twelve hours ago . According to reliable informants , they had stunned the recipients . Covert sources in all three cities had reacted to the news of Scofield 's " unsalvageable " behavior with some panic . Names could be revealed , men and women tortured , killed , whole networks exposed ; no time was to be lost in eliminating Beowulf Agate . Word had been relayed by early evening that two men had already been chosen as the killers . In Prague and Marseilles ; they were in the air now , on their way to Washington , no delays anticipated regarding passports or immigration procedures . A third would be leaving Amsterdam before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noon , an execution team totally disassociated from the United States government would be in Washington. , Each man had the same telephone number to call , an untraceablephone in the Baltimore ghetto . Whatever informationhad been gathered on Scofield would be relayed byTHE MATARESE CIRCLE 105the person at that number . And only one man could give that information to Baltimor The man responsible : the Director of Consular Operations . No one else in the United States government had the r:umber . Could one final connection be made ? wondered Congdon . There was so little time and it would take extraordinary cooperation . Could that cooperation be requested , even approached ? Nothing like it had ever happened . But if it could be made , a location might be uncovered , a dual execution guaranteed . He had been about to call the Secretary of State to suggest a very unusual , early morning meeting with the Soviet Ambassador . But too much time would be consumedwith diplomatic complications , neither side wishing to acknowledge the objective of violence . There was a better way ; it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed quietly , went downstairs , and entered the small study that was his office at home . He went to his desk which was bolted into the floor , the lower right-hand drawers concealing a safe with a combination lock . He turned on the lamp , opened the panel and twisted the dial . The lock clicked ; the steel plate sprung open . He reached inside and took out an index card with a telephone number written on it . The number was one he never thought he would call . The area code was 902  --  Nova Scotia  --  and it never went unanswered ; it was the number for a computer complex , the central clearing station for all Soviet intelligenceoperations in North America . By calling it , he exposed information that should not be revealed ; the complexin Nova Scotia was not supposedly known by U.S. intelligence , but time and the extraordinary circumstances overrode security . There was a man in Nova Scotia who would understand ; he would not be concerned about appearances . He had called for too many sentences of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Russia . Congdon reached for the telephone . " Cabot Strait Exporters , " said the male voice in Nova Scotia . " Night dispatcher . " " This is Daniel Congdon , Undersecretary of State , Consular Operations , United States Government . I requestthat you put a trace on this call to verify that I'm106 THE MATARESE CIRCLEtelephoning from a private residence in Herndon Falls , Virginia . While you 're doing that , please activate electronicscanners for evidence of taps on the line . You wo n't find any . I 'll wait as long as you wish , but I must speak with Voltage One , Vol't Adin , I think you call him . " His words were greeted by silence from Nova Scotia . It did not take much imagination to visualize a stunned operator pushing emergency buttons . Finally , the voice replied . " There seems to be interference . Please repeat your message . " Congdon did so . Again , silence . Then . " If you 'll hold on , the supervisor will speak with you . However , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cape Breton . " " You 're not in Cape Breton . You 're in Saint Peter 's Bay , Prince Edward Island . " " Hold on , please . " The wait took nearly three minutes . Congdon sat down ; it was working . Voltage One got on the line . " Please wait for a moment or two , " said the Russian . There followed the hollow sound of a connection still intact but suspended ; electronicdevices were in operation . The Soviet returned . " This call , indeed , originates from a residential telephone in the town of Herndon Falls , Virginia . The scanners pick up no evidence of interference but , of course , that could be meaningless . " " I do n't know what other proof to give you . . . . " " You mistake me , Mr. Undersecretary . The fact that you possess this number is not in itself earthshaking ; the fact that you have the audacity to use it and ask for me by my code name , perhaps is . I have the proof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Congdon told him in as few words as possible . " You want Taleniekov . We want Scofield . The contact ground is Washington , I 'm convinced of it . The key to the locationis your man from Brussels . " " If I recall , his body was delivered to the embassy several days ago . " " Yes . " " You 've connected it with Scofield ? " " Your own Ambassador did . He pointed out that the THE MATARESE CIRCLE 107man was part of a KGB section in East Berlin in 1968 . Taleniekov 's unit . There was an incident involving Scofield'swife . " " I see , " said the Russian . " So Beowulf Agate still kills for revenge . " " That 's a bit much , is n't it ? May I remind you that it would appear Taleniekov is coming after Scofield , not the other way around . " " Be specific , Mr. Undersecretary . Since we agree in principle , what do you want from us ? " " It 's in your computers , or in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , but it 's there ; it would be in ours . We believe that at one time or another the man from Brussels and Taleniekov operated in Washington . We need to know the address of the hole . It 's the only connection we have between Scofield and Taleniekov . We think that 's where they 'll meet . " " I see , " repeated the Soviet . " And presuming there is such an address , or addresses , what would be the position of your government ? " Congdon was prepared for the question . " No position at all , " he replied in a monotone . " The information will be relayed to others , men very much concerned about-BeowulfAgate 's recent behavior . Outside of myself , no one in my government will be involved . " " A ciphered cable , identical in substance , was sent to three counter-revolutionary cells in Europe . To Prague , Marseilles , and Amsterdam . Such cables can produce killers . " " I commend you on your interception , " said the Directorof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every day . No compliments are called for . " " You made no move to interfere ? " " Of course not , Mr. Undersecretary . Would you ? " " No . " " It 's eleven o'clock in Moscow . I 'll call you back within the hour . " Congdon hung up and leaned back in the chair . He desperately wanted a drink , but would not give in to the need . For the first time in a long career he was dealing directly with faceless enemies in Moscow . There could be no hint of irresponsibility ; he was alone and in that108 THE MATARESE CIRCLEsolitary contact was his protection . He closed his eyes and pictured blank walls of white concrete in his mind 's eye . Twenty-two minutes later the phone rang . He sprang forward and picked it up . " There 's a small , exclusive hotel on Nebraska Ave . nue .... " 8Scofield let the cold water run in the basin , leanee against the sink , and looked into the mirror . His eye ! were bloodshot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pronounced . He had not shaved in nearly three days , the periods of rest cumulatively not much more than thre ( hours . It was shortly past four in the morning and nc time to consider sleeping or shaving . Across the hall , Taleniekov 's well-dressed decoy wee getting no more sleep than he was ; the telephone call : were coming every fifteen minutes now . Mr. Brandon Scofield , please . I do n't know any Scofield ! Stop calling me ! Who an you ? A friend of Mr. Scofield 's . It 's urgent that I speal with him . He 's not here ! I do n't know him . Stop it ! You 're driv ing me crazy . 1 ' 11 tell the hotel not to ring this phom any more ! I would n't do that , if I were you . Your friend would not approve . You would n't be paid . Stop it ! Bray 's former lover from Paris was doing her ja well . She had asked only one question when he had mad the request @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in trouble , darling ? " " Yes . " " Then I 'll do as you ask . Tell me what you can , so I 'll know what to say . " " Do n't talk over twenty seconds . I do n't know who controls the switchboard . " " You are in trouble . " Within an hour , or less , the woman across the hall would go into panic and flee the hotel . Whatever she had been promised was not worth the macabre phone calls , the escalating sense of danger . The decoy would be removed , the hunter stymied . Taleniekov would then be forced to send in his birds1 and the process would start over again . Only the phone calls would come less frequently , perhaps every hour , just when sleep was settling in . Eventually , the birds would fly away , there being limits as to how long they could stay in the air . The hunter 's resources were extensive , but not that extensive . He was operating in foreign territory ; how many decoys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go on indefinitely calling blind contacts , setting up hastily summoned meetings , issuing instructions and money . No , he could not do that . Frustration and exhaustion would converge and the hunter would be alone , at the end of his resources . Finally , he would show himself . He had no choice ; he could not leave the drop unattended . It was the only trap he had , the only connection between himself and the quarry . Sooner or later Taleniekov would walk down the hotel corridor and stop at the door of suite 211 . When he did , it would be the last sight he 'd see . The Soviet killer was good , but he was going to lose his life to the man he called Beowulf Agate , thought Scofield . He turned off the faucet and plunged his face into the cold water . He pulled up his head ; there were sounds of movement in the corridor . He walked to the tiny circular peephole . Across the way , a matronly looking hotel maid was unvckingthe door . Draped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A maid at four o'clock in the morning ? Bray silently acknowledged Taleniekov 's imagination ; he had hired an all-night maid to be his lateighteyes inside . It was an able move , but flawed . Such110 THE MATARESE CIRCLE an individual was too limited , too easily removed ; she could be called away by the front desk . A guest had had an accident , a burning cigarette , an overturned pitcher of water . Too limited . And with a greater flaw . In the morning she would go off duty . And when she did , she would be summoned by a guest across the hall . Scofield was about to go back to his basin when he heard the commotion ; he looked once more through the glass circle . The well-dressed woman had walked out of the room , her overnight case in her hand . The maid stood in the doorway . Scofield could hear the decoy 's words . " Tell him to go to hell ! " shouted the woman . " He 's a fucking nut , dear . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maid watched in silence as the woman walked rapidly down the corridor . Then she closed the door , remaining inside . The matronly looking maid had been paid well ; she would be paid better in the morning by a guest across the hall . The negotiations would begin quickly the second she stepped out of the suite . The string was drawing tighter , everything was patience now . And staying awake . Taleniekov walked the streets , aware that his legs were close to buckling , struggling to stay alert and avoid col- liding with the crowds on the sidewalk . He played mental games to keep his concentration alive , counting footsteps and cracks in the pavement and blocks between telephone booths . The radios could not be used any long- er ; the citizen-bands were filled with babble . He cursed the fact that there had not been time to purchase more sophisticated equipment . But he never thought it could possibly go on so long ! Madness ! It was twenty minutes past eleven in the morning , the city of Washington vibrating , people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . and still the insane telephone calls kept coming to the suite at the hotel on Nebraska Avenue . Brandon Scofield , please . It 's urgent that I speak with him .... Insanity ! What was Scofield doing ? Where was he ? Where were his intermediaries ? Only the old woman remained in the hotel . The whore had revolted , the two men long since exhausted , their presence merely embarrassing , accomplishing nothing . The woman stayed in the suite , getting what rest she could between the maddening telephone calls , relaying every word spoken by the caller . A female with a pronounced " foreign " accent , probably French , never stay- , ing on the line more than fifteen seconds , unable to be drawn out and very abrupt . She was either a professional , or being instructed by a professional ; there could be no tracing the number or the location of the calls . Vasili approached the phone booth fifty yards north of the hotel 's entrance on the opposite side of the street . It was the fourth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had memorized the graffiti and the odd numbers scratched on the gray metal of the edge . He walked in , pulled the glass door shut , and inserted a coin ; the tone hummed in his ear and he reached for the dial . Prague ! His eyes were playing tricks on him ! Across Nebraska Avenue a man got out of a taxi and stood on the pavementlooking down the street toward the hotel . He knew that man ! At least , he knew the face . And it was Prague ! The man had a history of violence , both political and nonpolitical . His police record was filled with assaults , thefts , and unproven homicides , his years in prison nearerten than five . He had worked against the state more for profit than for ideology ; he had been well paid by the Americans . His firing arm was good , his knife better . That he was in Washington and less than fifty yards from this particular hotel could only mean he had a connection with Scofield . Yet there was no sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and women he could call upon for help in dozens of cities , but heI would not call on someone from Europe now , and he certainly would not call on this man ; the streak of sadism was conceivably unmanageable . Why was he here ? Who had summoned him ? 112 THE MATARESE CIRCLEWho had sent him ? And were there others ? But it was the why that burned into Taleniekov 's brain . It was profoundly disturbing . Beyond the fact that the Bern-Washington depot had been revealed  --  undoubtedly , unwittingly by Scofield himself  --  someone knowing it had reached Prague for a walking gun known to have performed extensively for the Americans . Why ? Who was the target ? Beowulf Agate ? Oh , God ! There was a method ; it had been used before by Washington . . . and strangely enough there was a vague similarity to the ways of the Matarese . Storm clouds over Washington . . . . Scofield had run into a storm so severe that he had not only been terminated , but conceivably his execution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man from Prague might himself be a ploy , a brilliant ploy , designed to trap a Russian , not kill an American . His hand was still suspended in front of the dial . He pressed down on the coin return lever and thought for a moment , wondering if he could take the risk . Then he saw the man across the street check his watch and turn toward the entrance of a coffee shop ; he was going to meet someone . There were others , and Vasili knew that he could not afford not to take the risk . He had to find out ; there was no way to know how much time was left . It might only be minutes . There was a pradavyet at the embassy , a diplomatic assistantwhose left foot had been blown off during a **26;6700;TOOLONG in Riga a number of years ago . He was a KGB veteran and he and Taleniekov had once been friends . It perhaps was not the moment to test that former friendship , but Vasili had no choice . He knew the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years . He reinserted the coin and dialed . " It 's been a long time since that terrible night in Riga , old friend , " said Taleniekov after having been connected to the pradavyet 's office . " Would you remain on the line , please , " was the reply . " I have another call . " Vasili stared at the telephone . If the wait was more than thirty seconds , he 'd have his answer ; the former friendshipwould not serve . There were ways for even the SoTHEMATARESE CIRCLE 113viets to trace a call in the national capital of the United States . He turned his wrist and kept his eyes on the thin , jumping hand of his watch . Twenty-eight , twenty-nine , thirty , thirty-one . . . thirty-two . He reached up to break the connection when he heard the voice . " Taleniekov ? It is you ? " Vasili recognized the echoing sound of an activated jamming device placed over the mouthpiece of a telephone . It operated on the principle of electronic spillage ; any intercepts would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I nearly hung up on you . " " Riga was not that long ago . What happened ? The stories we get are crazy . " " I 'm no traitor . " " No one over here thinks you are . We assume you stepped on some large Muscovite feet . But can you re-turn ? " " Someday , yes . " " I ca n't believe the charges . Yet you 're here ! " " Because I must be . For Russia 's sake , for all our sakes . Trust me . I need information , quickly . If anyone at the embassy has it , you would . " " What is it ? " " I 've just seen a man from Prague , someone the Americansused for his mare violent talents . We kept an extensivefile on him ; I assume we still keep it . Do you know anything " Beowulf Agate , " interrupted the diplomat quietly . " It 's Scofield , is n't it ? That 's what drives you still . " " Tell me what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Leave him alone . Leave him to his own people ; he 's finished . " " My God , I 'm right , " said Vasili , his eyes on the coffee shop across Nebraska Avenue . " I do n't know what you think you 're right about , but I know three cables were intercepted . To Prague , Marseillesand Amsterdam . " " They 've sent a team , " broke in Taleniekov . " Stay away . You have your revenge , the sweetest imaginable . After a lifetime , he 's taken by his own . " " It ca n't happen ! There are things you do n't know . " " It can happen regardless of what I know . We ca n't stop it . " 114 THE MATARESE CIRCLESuddenly , Vasili 's attention was drawn to a pedestrian about to cross the intersection not ten yards from the telephone booth . There was something about the man , the set expression of his face , the eyes that darted from side to side behind the lightly tinted glasses  --  bewildered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And the man 's clothes , loose-fitting , inexpensive tweeds , thick and made to last . . . they were French . The glasses were French , the man 's face itself Gallic . He looked across the street toward the marquee of the hotel , and hastened his step . Marseilles had arrived . " Come in to us . " The diplomat was speaking . " Whatever happened can not be irreparable in light of your **26;6728;TOOLONG . " The former comrade from Riga was being persuasive . Too persuasive . It was not in characterbetween professionals . " The fact that you came in voluntarily will be in your favor . Heaven knows , you 'll have our support . We 'll ascribe your flight to a temporary aberration , a highly emotional state . After all , Scofield killed your brother . " " I killed his wife . " " A wife is not blood . These things are understandable . Do the right thing . Come in , Taleniekov . " The excessive persuasion was now illogical . One did not voluntarily turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not with an order for summary execution on one 's head . Perhaps , after all , the former friendship could not stand the strain . " You 'll protect me ? " he asked the pradavyet . " Of course . " A lie . No such protection could be promised . Somethingwas wrong . Across the street , the man wearing tinted glasses approached the coffee shop . He slowed his pace , then stopped and went up to the window as if studying a menu affixed to the glass . He lit a cigarette . From inside , barely seen in the sunlight , there was a flicker of a match . The Frenchmanwent inside . Prague and Marseilles had made contact . " Thank you for your advice , " said Vasili into the phone . " I 'll think it over and call you back . " " It would be best if you did n't delay , " answered the dip-i lomat , urgency replacing sympathetic persuasion . " Your situation would not be improved by any involvement with Scofield . You should not be seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the words as though a gun had been fired in front of his face . In his gold friend 's knowledge was the betrayal ! Seen down where ? Ills colleague from Riga knew ! The hotel on Nebraska Avenue . Scofield had not exposed the Bern depot  --  unwittinglyor otherwise . KGB had ! Soviet intelligence was a participant in Beowulf Agate 's execution . Why ? The Matarese ? There was no time to think , only act . The hotel ! Scofield was not sitting alone by a phone in some out-of-the-way place , waiting to hear from intermediaries . He was in the hotel . No one would have to leave the premises to report to Beowulf Agate , no bird could be followed to the target . The target had executed a brilliant maneuver : he was in the direct range of fire , but unseen , observing but unobservable . " You really must listen to ate , Vasili . " The pradavyet 's words came faster now ; he obviously sensed indecision . If his former colleague from Riga had to be killed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the embassy . That was infinitely preferable to a comrade 's corpse being found in an American hotel , somehow tied to the murder of an American intelligence officer by foreign agents . Which meant the KGB had revealed the location of the depot to the Americans , but had not known the precise schedule of the execution at the time . They knew it now . Someone in the State Department had told them , the message clear . His countrymen had to stay away from the hotel  --  as did the Americans . None could be involved . Vasili had to buy minutes , for minutes might be all he had left . Diversion . " I 'm listening . " Taleniekov 's voice was choked with sincerity , an exhausted man coming to his senses . " You 're right . I 've nothing to gain now , only everything to lose . I put myself in your hands . If I can find a taxi in this Insane traffic , I 'll be at the embassy in thirty minutes . Watch for me . I need you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coin . He dialed the hotel 's number ; no second could be wasted . " He 's here ? " said the old woman incredulously , in reonseto Taleniekov 's statement . THE MATARESE CIRCLE 115116 THE MATARESE CIRCLE " My guess would be nearby . It would explain the timing , the phone calls , his knowing when someone was in the suite . He could hear sounds through the walls , open a door when be heard someone in the corridor . Are you still in your uniform ? " " Yes . I 'm too tired to take it off . " " Check the surrounding rooms . " " Good heavens , do you know what you 're asking ? What if he . .. " " I know what I 'm paying ; there 's more if you do it . Do it ! There 's not a moment to be lost ' I 'll call you back in five minutes . " " How will I know him ? " " He wo n't let you into the room . " Bray sat shirtless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold air send shivers through his body . He had brought the temperature of the room down to fifty degrees , the chill was necessary to keep him awake . A cold tired man was far more alert than a warm one . There was the tiny , blunt sound of metal slapping against metal , then the twisting of a knob . Outside in the hallwaya door was being opened . Scofield went to the window and closed it , then walked quickly to another window , his minute lookout on a narrow world that soon would be the site of his reverse trap . It had to be soon ; he was not sure how much longer he could go on . Across the way , the pleasant-looking elderly maid had come out of the suite , towels and sheets still draped over her arm . From the expression on her face , she was perplexedbut resigned . Undoubtedly , from her point of view , an unheard-of sum of money had been offered by a foreignerwho only wished her to remain in a grand suite of rooms and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calls . And someone else had stayed awake to make those calls . Someone Bray owed a great deal to ; he would repayher one day . But right now he concentrated on Taleniekov'sbird . She was leaving ; she was not capable of staying in the air any longer . She had abandoned the drop . It was only a question of time now and very little time at that . The hunter would be forced to examine his trap . And be caught in it . THE MATARESE CIRCLE 117Scofield walked over to his open suitcase on the luggage rack and took out a fresh shirt . Starched , not soft ; a crisp , starched shirt was like a cold room , a bi.ign irritant ; it kept one alert . He put it on , and crossed to the bedside table where he had placed his gun , a Browning Magnum , Grade 4 , with a custom-made silencer drilled to his specifications . Bray spun around at an unexpected sound . There was a hesitant tapping at his door . Why ? He had paid for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to those few employees who might have reason to enter room 213 that the sign on the knob was to be respected . Do Not Disturb . Yet someone was now disregarding that order , bypassinga guest 's request that had been re-enforced with several hundred dollars . Whoever it was was either deaf or illiterateor ... . It was the maid . Taleniekov 's bird , still in the air . Scofieldpeered through the tiny circle of glass that magnified the aged features of the face only inches away . The tired eyes , encased in wrinkled flesh swollen by lack of sleep , looked to the left , then the right , then dropped to the lower part of the door . The old woman had to be aware of the Do Not Disturb sign , but it had no meaning for her . Beyond the contradictory behavior , there was something odd about the face . . . but Bray had no time to study it further . Under these new circumstances , the negotiations had to begin quickly . He shoved the gun into his shirt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes ? " he asked . " Maid service , sir , " was the reply , spoken in an indeterminatebrogue , more guttural than definable . " The managementhas asked that all rooms be checked for supplies , sir . " It was a poor lie , the bird too flawed to think of a better one . " Come in , " said Scofield , reaching for the latch . " There 's no answer in suite two-eleven , " said the switchbeardoperator , annoyed by the persistence of the caller . " Try it again , " replied Taleniekov , his eyes on the entrance of the coffee shop across the street . " They may118 THE MATARESE CIRCLEhave stepped out for a moment , but they 'll be right back . I know it . Keep ringing , I 'll stay on the line . " " As you wish , sir , " snapped the operator . Madness ! Nine minutes had passed since the old woman had begun the search , nine minutes to check four doors in the hallway . Even assuming all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explanations to the occupants , nine minutes was far longer than she needed . A fourth conversation would be brief and blunt . Go away . I am not to be disturbed . Unless ... . A match flared in the sunlight , its reflection sharp in the . dark glass of the coffee shop window . Vasili blinked and stared ; from one of the unseen tables inside there was a corresponding signal , extinguished quickly . Amsterdam had arrived ; the execution team was complete . Taleniekov studied the figure walking toward the ' small restaurant . He was tall and dressed in a black overcoat , a gray silk muffler around his throat . His hat , too , , was gray , and obscured his profile . The ringing on the telephone was now abrasive . Long sudden bursts resulting from a furious operator punching a switchboard button . There was no answer and Vasili began to think the unthinkable : Beowulf Agate had interceptedhis bait . If so , the American was in greater danger than he could imagine . Three men had flown in from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less lethal  --  a gentle-appearing old woman whom he might try to compromisewould kill him the instant she felt cornered . He would never know where the shot came from , nor that she even had a weapon . " I 'm sorry , sir ! " said the operator angrily . " There 's still no pickup in suite two-eleven . I suggest you call again . " She did not wait for a reply ; the switchboard line was disconnected . The switchboard ? The operator ? It was a desperate tactic , one he would never condone except as a last-extremity measure ; the risk of exposure was too great . But it was the last extremity and if there were alternatives he was too exhausted to think of them . Again , he knew only that he had to act , each decision an instinctive reflex , the shaping of those instincts trusted . He . reached into his pocket for his money and removed five ' one-hundred dollar bills . Then he took out his passportTHE MATARESE CIRCLE 119ice , and extracted a letter he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The letterheadwas that of a brokerage house in Bern ; it identified the bearer as one of the firm 's partners . One never knew .... He walked out of the telephone booth and entered the flow of pedestrians until he was directly opposite the entrance of the hotel . He waited for a break in the traffic , then walked rapidly across Nebraska Avenue . Two minutes later a solicitous day manager introduced a Monsieur Blanchard to the operator of the hotel switchboard . This same manager  --  as impressed with Monsieur Blanchard 's credentials as he was with the two hundred dollars the Swiss financier had casually insisted he take for his troubles  --  dutifully provided a relief operator while the woman talked alone with the generous Monsieur Blanchard . " I ask you to forgive a worried man 's rudeness over the telephone , " said Taleniekov , as he pressed three one-hundred-dollarbills into her nervous hand . " The ways of internationalfinance can be appalling in these times . It is a bloodless war , a constant struggle to prevent unscrupulousmen from taking advantage of honest brokers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem . There 's someone in this hotel . . . . " A minute later , Vasili was reading a master list of telephonecharges , recorded by a mindless computer . He concentrated on the calls made from the second floor ; there were two corridors , suites 211 and 212 opposite three double rooms in the west wing , four single rooms on the other side . He studied all charges billed to telephones211 through 215 . Names would mean nothing ; local calls were not identified by number ; long distance charges were the only items that might provide information . Beowulf Agate had to build a cover and it would not be in Washington . He had killed a man in Washington . The hotel was , as Taleniekov knew , an expensive one . This was further confirmed by the range of calls made by guests who thought nothing of picking up a telephone and calling London as easily as a nearby restaurant . He scanned the sheets , concentrating on the O.O.T. areas listed. 120 THE MATARESE CIRCLE212 ... London , U.K. chgs : $26.50 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... Cedar Rapids , Ia. chgs : $6.20 213 ...

Suite 212 had made frequent calls to Europe , but that was too obvious , too dangerous . Scofield would not place such traceable calls . Room 214 was centered in the Midwest , Room 215 in the south . There was something but he could not pinpoint it . Somethingthat triggered a memory . Then he saw it and the memory was activated , clarified . The one room without a pattern . Room 213 . Two calls to Easton , Maryland , one to Minneapolis , Minnesota . Vasili could see the words in the dossier as if he were reading them . Brandon Scofield had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in case it was necessary to use them , if there was time to use them , to confirm them . He turned to the operator . " I do n't know what to say . You 've been most helpful but I do n't think there 's anything here that will help . " The switchboard operator had entered into the minor conspiracy , and was enjoying her prominence with the impressive Swiss . " If you 'll note , Monsieur Blanchard , suite two-twelve placed a number of overseas calls . " " Yes , I see that . Unfortunately , no one in those cities would have anything to do with the present crisis . Strange , though . Room two-thirteen telephoned Easton and Minneapolis . An odd coincidence , but I have friends in both places . However , nothing relevant .... " Vasili let his words drift off , inviting comment . " Just between the two of us , Monsieur Blanchard , I do n't think the gentleman in room two-thirteen is all there , if you know what I mean . " " Oh ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DND on 213 was a standing order ; no one was to disturb the man 's privacy . Even room service was instructed to leave the tray tables in the hallway , and maid service was to be suspended until specifically requested . To the best of the operator 's knowledge , there had been no such request in three days . Who could live like that ? " Of course , we get people like him all the time . Men who reserve a room so they can stay drunk for hours on end , or get away from their wives or meet other women . But three days without maid service , I think is sick . " " It 's hardly fastidious . " " You see it more and more , " said the woman confidentially . Especially in the government ; everyone 's so harried . But when you think our taxes are paying for it  --  I do n't mean yours , Monsieur ... . " He 's in the government ? " interrupted Taleniekov . " Oh , we think so . The night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but we 've been here for years , if you know what I mean . " " Old friends , of course . What happened ? " " Well , a man came by last evening  --  actually it was this morning , around five A.M.  --  and showed the manager a photograph . " " A picture of the man in two-thirteen ? " The operator glanced around briefly ; the door of the office was open , but she could not be overheard . " Yes . Apparently he 's really sick . An alcoholic or something , a psychiatric case . No one 's to say anything ; they do n't want to alarm him . A doctor will be coming for him sometimetoday . " " Sometime today ? And , of course , the man who showed the photograph identified himself as someone from the government , did n't he ? I mean , that 's how you learned the guest upstairs was in the government ? " " When you 've spent as many years in Washington as we have , Monsieur Blanchard , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all over their faces . " " Yes , I imagine it is . Thank you so much . You 've been great help . " Vasili left the room quickly and rushed out into the lobby . He had his confirmation . He had found Beowulf Agate. 1.22 THE MATARESE CIRCLEBut others had found him , too . Scofield 's executioners were only a few hundred feet away , preparing to close in on the condemned man . To break into the American 's room to warn him would be to invite an exchange of gunfire ; one or both would die . To reach him on the telephone would provoke only disbelief ; where was the credibility in such an alarm delivered by an enemy one loathed about a new enemy one did not know existed ? There had to be a way and it had to be found quickly . If there was only time to send another , with something on his person that would explain the truth to Scofield . Something Beowulf Agate would accept ... . There was no time . Vasili saw the man in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 9Scofield knew the instant the maid walked through the door what disturbed him about the elderly face . It was the eyes . There was an intelligence behind them beyond that of a plain-spoken domestic who spent her nights cleaningup the soils of pampered hotel guests . She was frightened  --  orperhaps merely curious  --  but whichever , neither was born of a blunt mind . An actress , perhaps ? " Forgive my disturbin ' you sir , " said the woman , noticinghis unshaven face and the cold room and heading for the open bathroom door . " I 'll not be a minute . " An actress . The brogue was an affectation , no roots in Ireland . Too , the walk was light ; she did not have the leg muscles of an old woman used to the drudgery of carryinglinens and bending over beds . And the hands were white and soft , not those of someone used to abrasive cleansers . Bray found himself pitying her even while faulting Taleniekov'schoice again . A real maid would have made a better bird . THE MATARESE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sir , " said the old woman coming out of the bathroom and heading for the door . " I 'll be on my way . Sorry for disturbin ' you . " Scofield stopped her with a gesture . " Sir ? " asked the woman , her eyes alert . " Tell me , what part of Ireland do you come from ? I ca n't place the dialect . County Wicklow , I think . " " Yes , sir . " " The south country ? " " Yes , sir ; very good , sir , " she said rapidly , her left hand on the doorknob . " Would you mind leaving me an extra towel ? Just put it on the bed . " " Oh ? " The old woman turned , the perplexed expression again on her face . " Yes , sir , of course . " She started toward the bed . Bray went to the door and pushed the bolt into place . He spoke as he did so , but gently ; there was nothing to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd like to talk to you . You see , I watched you last night , at four o'clock this morning to be precise  --  " A rush of air , the scratching of fabric . Sounds he was familiar with . Behind him in the room , He spun , but not in time . He heard the muted spit and felt a razorlike cut across the skin of his neck . An eruptionof blood , spread over his left shoulder . He lunged to his right ; a second shot followed , the bullet imbedding itself in the wall above him . He swung his arm in a violentarc , sending a lamp off a table toward the impossible sight six feet away , in the center of the room . The old woman had dropped the towels and in her hand was a gun . Gone was her soft , gentle bewilderment , in its place the calm , determined face of an experienced killer . He should have known/He dove to the floor , his fingers gripping the base of the table ; he spun again to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the table by its legs like a small battering ram . He rose , crashing forward ; two more shots were fired , splintering the wood inches above his head . He rammed the woman , hammering her back into the wall with such force that a stream of saliva accompanied the expulsion of breath from the snarling lips . " Bastard ! " The scream was swallowed as the gun clatteredto the floor . Scofield dropped the table , slamming it down on her feet as he reached for the weapon . He held it , stood up , and grabbed the bent-over woman by the hair , yanking her away from the wall . The red wig beneath the ruffled maid 's cap came off in his hand , throwing him off balance . From somewhere beneath the uniform , the gray-haired killer had pulled a knife  --  a thin stiletto . Bray had seen such weapons before ; they were as deadly as any gun , the blades coated with succinyl choline . Paralysis began in seconds , death seconds later . A scrape or a superficial puncture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on him , the thin knife plunging straight forward , the most difficult thrust to parry , used by the most experienced . He leaped backwards , crashing the gun down on the woman 's forearm . She withdrew it quickly in pain , but no suspension of purpose . " Do n't do it ! " he shouted , leveling the gun directly at her head . " Four shots were fired ; two shells are left ! I 'll kill you ! " The old woman stopped and lowered the knife . She stood motionless , speechless , breathing heavily , staring at him in a kind of ethereal disbelief . It occurred to Scofieldthat she had never been in this position before ; she had always won . Taleniekov 's bird was a vicious hawk in the guise of a small , gray dove . That protective coloration was her insurance . It had never failed her . " Who are you ? KGB ? " asked Bray , reaching for the towel on the bed , and holding it against the wound on his neck . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ focus . " You work for Taleniekov . Where is he ? " " I 'm paid by a man who uses many names , " she replied , the lethal knife still held limply in her hand . Her fury was gone , replaced by fear and exhaustion . " I do n't know who he is . I do n't know where he is . " " He knew where to find you . You 're something . Where did you learn ? When ? " " When ? " she repeated in her bloodless whisper . " When you were a child . Where ? Out of Belsen and Dachau .. . to other camps , other fronts . All of us . " " Christ . . . . " uttered Scofield softly . All of us . They were legion . Girls taken from the camps , sent to the war fronts , to barracks everywhere , to airfields . Surviving as whores , dishonored by their own , unwanted , ostracized . They became the scavengers of Europe . Taleniekov did know where to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? He 's no better than those who sent you to the camps . " " I have to . He 'll kill me . Now you say you will . " " Thirty seconds ago , I would have . You did n't give me a choice ; you can now . I 'll take care of you . You stay in contact with this man . How ? " " He calls . In the suite across the hall . " " How often . " " Every ten or fifteen minutes . He 'll call again soon . " " Let 's go , " said Bray cautiously . " Move to your right and drop the knife on the bed . " " Then you 'll shoot , " whispered the old woman . " If I was going to , I 'd do it now , " said Scofield . He needed her , needed her confidence . " There 'd be no reason to wait , would there ? Let 's get over to that phone . Whateverhe was paying , I 'll double . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think you broke my foot . " " I 'll help you . " Bray lowered the towel and took a step toward her . He held out his hand . " Take my arm . " The old woman placed her left foot in front of her painfully . Then suddenly , like an enraged lioness , she lunged forward , her face again contorted , her eyes wild . The blade came rushing toward Scofield 's stomach . Taleniekov followed the man from Amsterdam into the elevator . There was one other couple in the car . Young , rich , pampered Americans ; fashionably dressed lovers or newlyweds , aware only of themselves and their hungers . They had been drinking . The Hollander in the black overcoat removed his gray homburg , as Vasili , his face briefly turned away , stood next to him against the paneled wall of the small enclosure . The doors closed . The girl laughed softly ; her companionpressed the button for the fifth floor . The man from Amsterdam stepped forward and touched number 2 . As he moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makingcontact with Taleniekov 's . The man froze , the shock total , the recognition absolute . And in that shock , that recognition , Vasili saw another truth : the execution trap was meant for him as well . The team had a priority , and it was Beowulf Agate , but if a KGB agent known as Taleniekov appeared on the scene he was to be taken out as ruthlessly as Scofield . rThe man from Amsterdam swung his hat in front of his chest , plunging his right hand into his pocket . Vasili rushed him , pinning him against the wall , his left hand gripping the wrist in the pocket , slipping down , separat- ing hand from weapon , groping for the thumb , twisting it back until the bone cracked and the man bleated . He sank to his knees . The girl screamed . Taleniekov spoke in a loud voice . He addressed the couple . " You will not be harmed . I repeat , you will not be harmed if you do as I say . Make no noise , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the right ; Vasili slammed his knee into the man 's face , vicing the head against the wall . He took his gun from his pocket and held it up , pointing at the ceiling . " I will not use this . I will not use this unless you dis- obey . You 're no part of our dispute and I do n't want you harmed . But you must do as I say . " " Jesus . Jesus Christ ! ... " The young man 's lips trem- bled . " Take out your key , " ordered Taleniekov almost ami- ably . " When the doors open walk casually in front of us to your room . You will be perfectly safe if you do as I say . If you do n't , if you cry out , or try to raise an alarm , I shall have to shoot . I wo n't kill you ; instead , I 'll fire into your spines . You 'll be paralyzed for life . " " Oh , Christ , please ! . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , neck , and shoulders . " Please , mister ! We 'll do whatever you say ! " The girl at least was lucid ; she took the key from her lover 's vest . " Get up ! " said Vasili to the man from Amsterdam . He reached into the killer 's overcoat pocket and removed the Hollander 's weapon . The elevator doors opened . The couple walked out stiff- ly , passing an elderly man reading a newspaper , and THE MATARESE CIRCLE 127turned right down the corridor . Taleniekov , his GrazBuryaconcealed at his side , gripped the cloth of Amsterdam'sovercoat , propelling him forward . " One sound , Dutchman , " he whispered , " and you 'll not make another . I 'll blow your back away ; you wo n't have time to scream . " Inside the double room , Vasili shoved the Hollander into a chair , held his gun on him , and issued orders once again to the frightened couple . " Get inside that clothes closet . Quickly ! " Tears were streaming down the young man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark , temporary cell . Taleniekov propped a chair underneath the knob and kicked it until it was wedged firmly between the metal and the rug . He turned to the Hollander . " You have exactly five seconds to explain how it 's to be done , " he said , raising the automatic diagonally across the executioner 's face . " You 'll have to be clearer , " came the professional reply . By all means . " Vasili slammed the barrel of the GrazBuryadownward , ripping the flesh of the assassin 's face . Blood spread ; the man raised his hands . Taleniekov bent over the chair and cracked both wrists in rapid succession . " Do n't touch ! We 've just begun . Drink it ! Soon you 'll have no lips . Then no teeth , no chin , no cheekbones ! Finally , I 'll take your eyes ! Have you ever seen a man like that ? The face is a terrible source of pain , puncturing the eyes unendurable . " Vasili struck again , now arcing upwards , catching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .... No ! I followed orders ! " " Where have I heard that before ? " Taleniekov raised the weapon ; again the hands were raised and again they were repulsed with blows . " What are those orders , Dutchman ? There are three of you and the five seconds have passed ! We must be serious now . " He tapped the barrel of the Graz-Burya harshly over the Hollander 's left eye , then the right . " No more time ! " He pulled the weapon back then shoved it knifelike into Amsterdam 's throat . " Stop ! " screamed the man , his air cut off , the word garbled . " I 'll tell you . . . . He betrays us , he takes money for our names . He 's sold out to our enemies ! " " No judgments . The orders ! " " He 's never seen me . I 'm to draw him out . " 128 THE MATARESE CIRCLE THE MATARESE CIRCLE 129 " How ? " " You . I 've come to warn him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd reject you . Kill you ! A transparent device . How did you know the room ? " " We have a photograph . " " Of him . Not of me . " " Both of you , actually . But I show him only his . 4'he night manager identified him . " " Who gave you this photograph ? " " Friends from Prague , operating in Washington , with ties to the Soviet . Former friends of Beowulf Agate who know what he 's done . " Taleniekov stared at the man from Amsterdam . He was telling the truth , because the explanation was based on partial truth . Scofield would look for flaws , but would not reject Amsterdam 's words ; he could not afford that luxury . He would take the Dutchman as hostage , and then positionhimself . Waiting , watching , unseen . Vasili pressed the barrel of the Graz-Burya into the Hollander 's right eye . " Marseilles and Prague . Where are they ? Where will they be ? " " Besides the main elevators there are only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service lift . One will be stationed in each . " " Which are where ? " " Prague on the staircase , Marseilles on the service lift . " " What 's the schedule ? By minutes . " " It 's floating . I approach the door at ten past twelve . " Taleniekov glanced at the antique clock on the hotel room desk . It was eleven minutes past twelve . " They 're in position now . " " I do n't know . I ca n't see my watch , the blood 's in my eyes . " " What 's the termination ? If you lie , I 'll know it . You 'll die in a way you 've never dreamed of . Describe it ! " " Zero-lock is five minutes past the half hour . If Beowulf has not appeared in either location , the room is to be stormed . Frankly , I do n't trust Prague . I think he 'd throw Marseilles and myself in first to take the initial fire . He 's a maniac . " Vasili @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I 've told you everything ! Do n't strike me again . For God 's sake , let me wipe my eyes . I ca n't see . " " Wipe them . I want you to see clearly . Get up ! " The Hollander rose , his hands covering his face , brushing away the rivulets of blood , the Graz-Burya jammed into his neck . Taleniekov stood motionless for a moment , looking at the telephone across the room . He was about to speak with an enemy he had hated for a decade , about to hear his voice . He would try to save that enemy 's life . Scofield spun away as the lethal blade sliced into his shirt , blunted by the steel of his gun concealed under the starched cloth only minutes ago . The old woman was insane , suicidal ! He would have to kill her and he did not want to kill her ! The gun . He said four shells had been fired , two were left . She knew differently ! She was coming at him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its path would have to be touched , scraped  --  under normal circumstances a meaninglessscratch , but not with this blade . He aimed the gun at her head and squeezed the trigger ; there was nothing but the click of the firing pin . He lashed his right foot out catching her between her breast and her armpit , staggering her for an instant , but only an instant . She was wild , clutching the knife as if it were her passport to life ; if she touched him , she was free . She crouched , swinging her left arm in front of her , coveringthe blade that worked furiously in her right . He jumped back , looking for something , anything he could use to parry her lunges . Why had she delayed before ? Why had she suddenly stopped and spoken with him , telling him things that would make him think ? Then he knew . The old hawk was not only vicious , but wise ; she knew when she had to restore dissipated strength , knew she could do it only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the unguarded instant ... one touch of the coated blade . She lunged again , the knife arcing up from the floor toward his legs . He kicked ; she whipped the blade back , then slashed laterally , missing the kneecap by centimeters . As her arm swung left with the slash , he caught her shoulderwith his right foot and hammered her backwards. 130 THE MATARESE CIRCLEShe fell ; he grabbed the nearest upright object  --  a floor lamp with a heavy brass base  --  hurling it down at her as he kicked again at the hand that held the stiletto . Her wrist was bent ; the point of the blade pierced the fabric of her maid 's uniform , entering the flesh above her left breast . What followed was a sight he did not care to toemember . The old woman 's eyes grew wide and thyroid , her lips stretched into a macabre , horrible grin that was no smile . She began to writhe on the floor , her body convulsedand trembling . She rolled into a fetal position , pulling her thin legs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muffled screams came from her throat as she rolled again , clawing the rug ; mucus disgorged from her convoluted mouth , a swollen tongue blocking passage . Suddenly there was a horrible gasp and a final expulsion of breath . Her body jerked off the floor spastically ; it becamerigid . Her eyes were open wide , staring at nothing , her lips parted in death . The process had taken less than sixty seconds . Bray leaned over and lifted the hand , separating the bony fingers . He removed the knife , stood up , and walked to the bureau where there was a book of matches . He struck one and held it under the blade . There was an eruption of flame spitting so high that it singed his hair , the heat so intense it burned his face . He dropped the stiletto , stamping the fire out under his foot . The phone rang . " This is Taleniekov , " said the Russian into the silence of the telephone . It had been picked up but there was no voice on the line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by acknowledging our contact . " " Acknowledged , " was the one-word reply . " You reject my cable , my white flag , and were I you , I would do the same . But you 're wrong and I would be wrong .

Come and get me . I 'm ready for you . " " Stop it ! We both killed . You took a brother . . . and THE MATARESE CIRCLE 131before that , an innocent young girl who was no threat to the animals who raped her and killed her ! " " What ? " " There 's no time !

He 's from Amsterdam . His face is damaged and he ca n't see very well , but he can speak . " Vasili pressed the telephone against the Hollander'sbloody lips and shoved the Graz-Burya into his neck . " Tell him , Dutchman ! " " Cables were sent . . . . " The injured man whispered , choking on fear and blood . " Amsterdam , Marseilles , Prague . Beowulf Agate was beyond salvage . We could all be killed if he lived . The cables made the usual statements : they were alerts , urging us to take precautions , but we knew what they meant . Do n't take precautions , take out the problem , eliminate Beowulf ourselves . . . . None of this is new to you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know they must be carried out . " Taleniekov yanked the phone away while keeping the barrel of his weapon pressed against Amsterdam 's neck . " You heard it . The trap you set for me is being used to ambush you . By your own people . " Silence . Beowulf Agate said nothing . Vasili 's patience was running out . " Do n't you understand ? They 've exchangedinformation , it 's the only way they could have found the depot  --  what you call a drop . ' Moscow providedit , ca n't you see that ? Each of us is being used as the reason to execute the other , to kill us both . My people are more direct than yours . The order for my death has been sent to every Soviet station , civilian and military . Your State Department does it somewhat differently ; the analysts take no responsibility for such unconstitutional decisions . They simply send warnings to those who care little for abstractions , but deeply for their lives . " Silence . Taleniekov exploded . " What more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CIRCLEyou out ; you would have had no choice . You would have tried to position yourself in one of two exits : the service area or the staircase . At this moment , Marseilles is by the service elevator , Prague on the staircase . The man from Prague is one you know well , Beowulf . You 've employed his gun and his knife on many occasions . He 's waiting for you . In less than fifteen minutes , if you do not appear in either place , they will take you in your room . What401nore do you want ? " Scofield answered at last . " I want to know why you 're telling me this . " " Reread my cipher to you ! This is n't the first time you and I have been used . An incredible thing is happening and it goes beyond you and me . A few men know about it . In Washington and Moscow . But they say nothing ; no one can say anything . The admissions are catastrophic . " " What admissions ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes back years , decades . " " How does it concern me ? I do n't care about you . " " Dimitri Yurievich . " " What about him ? " " They said you killed him . " " You 're lying , Taleniekov . I thought you 'd be better at it . Yurievich was leaning , he was a probable . The civilian killed was my contact , under my source-control . It was a KGB operation . Better a dead physicist than a defected one . I repeat , come and get me . " " You 're wrong ! . . . Later ! There 's no time to argue . You want proof ? Then listen ! I trust your ear is more skilled than your mind ! " The Russian quickly shoved the Graz-Burya into his belt and held the mouthpiece up in the air . With his left hand he gripped the throat of the man from Amsterdam , his thumb centering on the rings of trachea cartilage . He pressed ; his hand was a vise , his fingers talons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hollander twisted violently , his arms and hands thrashing , trying to break Vasili 's grip , the effort useless . His cry of pain was an unbroken scream that diminished into a wail of agony . The man from Amsterdam fell to the floor unconscious . Taleniekov spoke again into the telephone . " Is there human bait alive who would permit what I 've just done ? " THE MATARESE CIRCLE " Was he given an alternative ? " " You 're a fool , Scofield ! Get yourself killed ! " Vasili shook his head in desperation ; it was a reaction to his own loss of control . " No .... No , you must n't . You ca n't understand , and I must try to grasp that , so you must try to understand me . I loathe everything you are , everything you stand for . But right now , we can do what few others can do . Make men listen , make them speak out . If for no other reason than they fear us , fear what we know . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know what you 're talking about , " interrupted Scofield . " You 're mounting a nice KGB strategy ; they 'll probably give you a large dacha in Grasnov , but no sale . I repeat , come and get me . " " Enough ! " shouted Taleniekov , looking at the clock on the desk . " You have eleven minutes ! You know where your final proof is . You can find it in a service lift or on the staircase . Unless you care to learn it as you die in your room . If you create a disturbance , you 'll draw a crowd . That 's more to their liking , but I do n't have to tell you that ; you may recognize Prague , you wo n't Marseilles . You ca n't call the police , or risk the chance that the managementwill ; we both know that . Go find your proof , Scofield ! See if this enemy is lying . You 'll get as far as your first turn in the corridor ! If you live  --  which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Room five-zero-five . I 've done what I can ! " Vasili slammed down the phone , the gesture equal parts artifice and anger . Anything to jar the American , anything to make him think . Taleniekov needed every second now . He had told Beowulf Agate that he had done all he could , but it was not true . He knelt down and tore off the black overcoat from Amsterdam 's unconscious body . Bray replaced the phone , his mind was churning . If he 'd only had sleep , or if he had not gone through the totally unexpected violence of the old woman 's attack , or if Taleniekovhad not told him so much of the truth , things would be clearer . But it had all happened and , as he had done so often in the past , he had to shift into a state of blind acceptance and think in terms of immediate purpose . It was not the first time he had been the target of fac-133134 THE MATARESE CIRCLE THE MATARESE CIRCLE 135tions distinct from each other . One got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same broadbasedcamps , although killing was rarely the objective . What was unusual was the timing , the converging of separateassaults . Yet it was so understandable , so clear . Undersecretary of State Daniel Congdon had really done it ! The seemingly bloodless deskman had found the courage of his own convictions . More specifically , he had found Taleniekov and Taleniekov 's moves towatd Beowulf Agate . What better reasoning existed for breaking the rules and eliminating a terminated specialist he considered dangerous ? What better motive for reaching the Soviets , who could only favor the dispatch of both men . So clear . So well orchestrated he or Taleniekov might have conceived of the strategy . Denials and astonishment would go hand in hand , statesmen in Washington and Moscow decrying the violence of former intelligence officers  --  fromanother era . An era when personal animosities often superseded national interests . Christ , he could hear the pronouncements , couched in sanctimonious platitudes made by men like Congdon who concealed filthy decisions under respectable titles . The infuriating thing was that the reality supported the platitudes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I swore I 'd kill you , Beowulf Agate , and perhapsone day I will . That day was today , the perhaps without meaning for the Russian . Taleniekov wanted Beowulf Agate for himself ; he would brook no interference from killers recruited and programed by deskmen in Washington and Moscow . I will see you take your last breath . . . . Those were Taleniekov 's words six years ago ; he meant them then and he meant them now . Certainly he would save his enemy from the guns of Marseilles and Prague . His enemy was worthy of a better gun , his gun . And no ploy was too unreasonable , no words too extreme , to bring his enemy into that gunsight . He was tired of it all , thought Scofield , taking his hand away from the phone . Tired of the tension of move and countermove . In the final analysis , who cared ? Who gave a godamn for two aging specialists , dedicated to the proposition that each 's counterpart should die ? Bray closed his eyes , pressing his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Tears of fatigue , mind and body spent ; it was no time to acknowledge exhaustion . Because he cared . If he had to die  --  and it was always an around-the-corner possibility  --  he was not going to be taken by guns from Marseilles , Prague or Moscow . He was better than that ; he had always been better . According to Taleniekov he had eleven minutes ; two had passed since the Russian had made the statement . The trap was his room and if the man from Prague was the one Taleniekov had described , the attack would be made quickly , with a minimum of risk . Gas-filled pellets would precede any use of weapons , the fumes immobilizinganyone in the room . It was a tactic favored by the killer from Prague ; he took few gambles . The immediate objective , therefore , was to get out of the trap . Walking in the corridor was not feasible , perhaps not even opening the door . Since it was Amsterdam'sfunction to draw him out , and he had not been drawn , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one in the hallway  --  as the absence of sound indicated  --  they had nothing to lose . Their schedule would not be postponed , but it could be accelerated . No one in the hallway . . . someone in the hallway . People milling around , excited , creating a diversion . Most of the time a crowd was to the killers ' advantage , not the target 's , especially if the target was identifiable and one or more of the killers were not . On the other hand , a target who knew precisely when and where the attack was to be made , could use a crowd to cover his run from ground-zero . An escape based on confusion , and a change of appearance . The change did not have to be much , just enough to cause indecision ; indiscriminate gunfireduring an execution had to be avoided . Eight minutes . Or less . Everything was preparation . He would take his essential belongings , for when he began running , he 'd have to keep running ; how long and how far there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about that now . He had to get out of the trap and elude four men who wanted him dead , one more dangerous than the other three for he was not sent by Washington or Moscow . He had come himself . Bray crossed rapidly to the dead woman on the floor , 136 THE MATARESE CIRCLEdragged her to the bathroom , rolled the corpse inside , and closed the door . He picked up the heavy-based lamp and smashed it down on the knob ; the lock was jammed , the door could be opened only by breaking it down . His clothes could be left behind . There were no laundrymarks or overt evidence connecting them immediately to Brandon Scofield ; fingerprints would do that , but lifting and processing them would take time . He wdtald be far away by then  --  if he got out of the hotel alive . His attache case was something else ; it contained too many tools of his profession . He closed it , spun the combinationlock , and threw it on the bed . He put on his jacket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and dialed the operator . " This is room two-thirteen , " he said in a whisper , effortlesslymade to sound weak . " I do n't want to alarm you , but I  --  know the symptoms . I 've had a stroke . I need help .... " He let the phone crash against the table and drop to the floor. 10Taleniekov put on the black overcoat , and reached down for the gray scarf , still draped around Amsterdam 's throat . He yanked it off , wound it around his throat , and picked up the gray hat which had fallen beside the chair . It was too large ; he creased the crown so it covered his head less awkwardly , and started for the door , passing the closet . He spoke firmly to the couple within . " Remain where you are and make no sound ! I shall be outside in the corridor . If I hear noise , I 'll come back and you 'll be the worse for it . " In the hall , he ran toward the main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark elevator at the end of the corridor . Against the wall was a tray table used by room service . He removed his Graz-Burya from his belt , shoved it in his overcoat pocket , and pushed the button with his left hand . The red light went on above the door ; the elevaTHEMATARESE CIRCLE 137tor was on the second floor . Marseilles was in position , waiting for Beowulf Agate . The light went off and seconds later the number 3 shone brightly , then number 4 . Vasili turned around , his back to the sliding panel . The door opened , but there were no words of recognition , no surprise expressed at the sight of the black overcoator the gray hat . Taleniekov spun around , his finger on the trigger of his gun . There was no one inside the elevator . He stepped in and pressed the button for the second floor . " Sir ? Sir ? My God , it 's the crazy one in two-thirteen ! " The excited voice of the operator floated up piercingly from the telephone on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! See what they can do ! I 'll call an ambulance . He 's had an attack or something . . . . " The words were cut off ; the chaos had begun . Scofield stood by the door , unlatched it and waited . No more than forty seconds passed by when he heard racing footsteps and shouts in the corridor . The door burst open ; the bell captain ran in , followed by a younger , larger man , a bellboy . " Thank Christ it was n't locked ! Where ? ... " Bray kicked the door shut , revealing himself to the two men . In his hand was his automatic . " No one 's going to get hurt , " he said calmly . " Just do exactly as I tell you . You , " Bray ordered the younger man . " Take off your jacket and your cap . And you , " he continued , speaking to the bell captain , " get on the phone and tell the operator to send up the manager . You 're scared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may have been trouble up here . You think I 'm dead . " The older man stuttered , his eyes riveted on the gun , then ran to the phone . The performance was convincing , he was frightened out of his wits . Bray took the maroon and gold-striped jacket held out for him by the large subordinate . He removed his coat and put it on , bunching his own under his arm . " The cap , " demandedScofield . It was given . The bell captain finished , his eyes staring wildly at Bray , his last plea screamed ! " For Christ 's sake , hurry/ Get someone up here ! " 138 THE MATARESE CIRCLEScofield gestured with his weapon . " Stand by the door next to me , " he said to the frantic man , then addressed the younger . " There 's a closet over there beyond the bed . Get inside . Now ! " The large , dense bellboy hesitated , looked at Bray 's face , , and retreated quickly into the closet . Scofield , his weapon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward/ the closet and kicked the door shut . He picked up the lamp by its stem . " Get over to your right ! Do you understand ? Answer me ! " " Yeah , " came the muffled reply from inside . " Knock on the door ! " The tap came from the extreme left , the young man 's right . Bray crashed the base of the lamp down on the knob ; it broke off . Then he raised his gun , its silencer attached , and fired one shot into the right side of the door . " That was a bullet ! " he said . " No matter what you hear , keep your mouth shut or there 'll be another . I 'm right outsidethis door ! " " Oh , my God .... " The man would stay silent through an earthquake . Scofieldwent back to the bell captain , picking up his attache case on the way . " Where 's the staircase ? " " Down the hall to the elevators , turn right . It 's at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Same thing , the other way , the other end . Turn left at  --  " " Listen to me , " interrupted Bray , " and remember what I tell you . In a few seconds we 'll hear the manager and probably others coming down the hall . When I open the door , you step outside and shout  --  and I mean scream your fucking head off  --  then start running down the corridor with me . " " Christ ! What am I supposed to say ? " " That you want to get out of here , " answered Bray . " Sayit anyway you like . I do n't think it 'll be difficult for you . " " Where are we going ? I got a wife and four kids ! " " That 's nice . Why do n't you go home ? " " What ? " " What 's the quickest way to the lobby ? " " Christ , I do n't know ! " " Elevators can take a lone time . " THE MATARESE CIRCLE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ panicked bell captainfound triumph in his deduction . " Use the staircase , " said Scofield , his ear at the door . The voices were muffled , but intense . He could hear the words police and ambulance , and then emergency . There were three or four people . Bray yanked the door back and pushed the bell captain out into the corridor . " Now , " he said . Taleniekov turned away as the service elevator opened on the second floor . Again the black overcoat and the distinctivegray hat evoked no sounds of recognition , and again he spun , his hand gripping the Graz-Burya in his pocket . There were tray tables of half-eaten food and the odor of coffee  --  remnants of late breakfasts piling up outside the elevator door  --  but no Marseilles . A pair of hinged metal doors opened into the secondfloorcorridor , round windows in the center of each panel . Vasili approached and peered through the right circle . There he was . The figure in the heavy tweed suit was edging his way along the wall toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Taleniekov looked at his watch ; it was 12:31 . Four minutes until the attack ; a lifetime if Scofield kept his head about him . A diversion was needed ; fire was the surest . A telephone call , a flaming pillow case stuffed with cloth and paper thrown into the hallway . He wondered if Beowulf Agate had thought of it . Scofield had thought of something . Down the hall the light above one of the two main elevators went on ; the door opened , and three men rushed out talking frantically . One was the manager , now close to panic ; another carried a black bag : a doctor . The third , was burly , his face set , the hair close-cropped . . . the hotel 's private police officer . They raced past the startled Marseilles  --  who turned abruptly away  --  and proceeded down the long corridor that led to Scofield 's room . The Frenchman took out a gun . At the other end of the hallway , below a red Exit sign , a heavy door with a crash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , nodding at Marseilles . In his right hand was a long-barreled , heavy-caliber automatic , in his left what looked like . . . it was . . . a grenade . The thumb was curved , pressing on the lever ; the firing pin was out !
