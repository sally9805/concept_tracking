Says Chaplin , who for 13 years has lived uncompromisingly with Spanish Director Carlos Saura : " I like playing her . I would n't want to live next door to her . " <P> <P> As sound and light shows go , it was a stunner . This time the ageless Pyramids of Giza were bathed in Sinatra as well as lumire . Ol ' Blue Eyes , accompanied by Wife Barbara , appeared in Cairo for the first time as part of a three-day bash to raise funds for Wafa Wal Amal , the rehabilitation center for the handicapped that is First @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struck it off famously , but Sinatra kept mostly to himself until showtime . By then the sand near the Pyramids had been covered with 300 carpets for the comfort of guests who had paid up to $30,000 a table to hear him sing such golden oldies as The Lady Is a Tramp , Someone to Watch over Me and , of course , My Way .

" In another effort to make ends meet , Welles can be seen on closed-circuit TV at Caesars Palace explaining the intricacies of craps , baccarat , roulette and blackjack to fledgling high rollers . <P> <P> The explanations in Welles ' orotund delivery become bemusingly classical : " The biggest dice game in history was for some very high stakes indeed .
