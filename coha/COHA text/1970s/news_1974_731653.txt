txt THE 7,400-MEMBER Confederation of Police vowed Sunday not to issue any traffic tickets until Chicago police get a contract . An effigy of Mayor Daley hung from a chandelier at the Holiday Inn at Halsted and Madison Streets as 200 COP members approved the proposed moratorium on moving and stationary traffic tickets . Dissatisfied with proposed salary Increases for policemen in 1975 , the group vowed to continue the protest until the city gives police the right to bargain collectively . THE TICKET-writing boycott Is not expected to start in earnest until at least Tuesday . It will take that long before COP members , who represent more than half the police force , are notified of the boycott , a union official said . A check of the Loop theater district along Randolph Street Sunday night showed dozens of cars ticketed for parking violation . MAYOR DALEY , whose proposed 1975 budget would provide salary increases ranging from 8.5 to 12.4 per cent , was the target of the group 's anger . " Do n't confuse yourself with a lot of enemies , " COP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , " You have one enemy . " The proposed budget also includes an estimated $10 million in new revenue that would be generated by doubling-parking fines . " He Daley wo n't put no money in your pocket , " a policeman shouted from the audience . " Do n't put no money in his . " The remark referred to the parking fines . " We 're supposed to go out and make money for him ( Daley by writing them Mickey Mouse citations , " he shouted later in the meeting . " What we need , " Johnson said , " is unity and perserverance . " He told COP members to be prepared for a long fight and urged them to bring . fellow officers in the 13,000-man department into the contract fight . With a written contract , Johnson said , policemen could negotiate better salaries and such issues as required Chicago residency . THE ' DECISION followed a report . by COP treasurer Walter Biesiada on the group 's rej e c t e d budget demands . Among the requests Daley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across-the-board salary increase , a contract , and seniority in job assignments . Johnson told the group COP leeders had decided on four options of protest : picketing , answering emergency calls only , disallowing such " courtesy parking " as delivery trucks double-parking , and halting ticket writing . The difficulty about a ticketwriting moratorium , Johnson said , is " you ca n't announce it publicly . " The membership at the meeting however , showed no hesitancy in proclaiming the moratorium . The cutoff in ticket writing , which went into effect 3 p.m . Sunday , is the first step in the contract fight , the group decided . They agreed to meet in two weeks , and invited the Chicago Patrolmen 's Association CPA to that meeting to decide on the next steps . Joseph Pecoraro said CPA members also were unhappy with the budget proposals . They " want to do the same thing , " Pecoraro said . ' Tm sure they 'll support you . " Police department officials will probably " issue orders to break the unity of the boycott , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ticket " blitz " in response to a similar moratorium , Johnson said . " But it failed , " he said . THE MORATORIUM was to be absolute . One policeman suggested the group allow ticketing for serious violations , such as 70 m.p.h. speeding in a school zone as school let out . But he was shouted down
