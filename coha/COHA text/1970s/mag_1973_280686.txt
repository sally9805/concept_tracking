" If they beat me , I will admit anything , " Soviet Historian Pyotr Yakir told a journalist before he was arrested last year . " I know this from my former experience in the camps . But you 'll know it wo n't be the real me speaking . " <P> Last week Yakir was paraded before 300 foreign and Russian newsmen for an extraordinarily confessional press conference at Moscow 's Journalists ' Club . Looking remarkably fit despite 15 months of pretrail detention and interrogation , the leonine-headed dissident recited a prepared statement in a monotone while smoking Bulgarian cigarettes and sipping Caucasian mineral water . Along with his convicted codefendant , Economist Viktor Krasin , Yakir repeated the recantations that had earned them both relatively mild sentences ( three years in prison and three years of exile ) at their trial on charges of subversion ( TIME , Sept. 10 ) . <P> Latest Effort . Yakir , who has already served 17 years in Soviet prison camps , insisted that he had worked for foreign anti-Soviet organizations and received payment from Western journalists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movement , said Yakir and Krasin , was a foreign plot . For longtime Moscow hands , the chilling recital recalled the public confessions at the purge trials of the 1930s . Soviet spokesmen went out of their way last week , however , to insist that the conviction of Yakir and Krasin did not represent a return to Stalinism . <P> Broadcast on Soviet state television , the press conference was the latest effort by the Kremlin to dismiss domestic critics of the regime as foreign agents even as the state further terrorizes the dwindling band of dissidents . At the same time , a massive Soviet press campaign was mounted against the two towering spiritual leaders of Russia 's " democratic movement , " Physicist Andrei Sakharov and Novelist Alexander Solzhenitsyn . With an evident absence of spontaneity , hundreds of indignant letter writers spewed forth abuse against the two intellectuals in the pages of Pravda , Izvestia and other official newspapers . In part , the list of Sakharov 's and Solzhenitsyn 's accusers read like an " S. Hurok presents " concert program . Violinists David Oistrakh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dying coals of the cold war . " Dmitri Shostakovich , who once praised Stalin for his " wise and delicate " musical advice , joined Aram Khachaturian and other composers in accusing Sakharov of debasing " the honor and dignity of the Soviet intelligentsia . " Scientists , writers , even farmers and factory workers chimed in with other messages of accusation against the two dissidents . <P> Legal Action . This highly orchestrated campaign is obviously calculated to prepare public opinion for legal action against Sakharov , who helped develop the Soviet hydrogen bomb , and Solzhenitsyn , the Nobel prizewinning author . Just as obviously , bold recent statements by both men to foreign journalists have strained the Kremlin 's tolerance close to the breaking point .
