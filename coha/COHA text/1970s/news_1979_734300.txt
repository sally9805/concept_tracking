txt WASHINGTON ? Twenty-six years ago , Julius and Ethel Rosenberg died in the electric chair for giving the Soviets the same kind ' of information now sold on the- paperback racks of America 's newsstands and drugstores . The information explains how to make a nuclear bomb , a favorite topic of pulp novelists who churn out fiction to satisfy the national lust for disaster novels . The technical information included in many of these paperbacks is one of the biggest headaches facing a tightly knit , low-profile body of officials whose job is to prepare for the day when a terrorist organization or a cadre of criminals joins the nuclear club . The stakes are high . Libya 's chief of state , Muammar Khaddafy , has openly offered $1 million to anyone who will produce a nuclear weapon for him . Ransoming whole cities for many millions also is a possibility that officials , must consider . THE LITERATURE on bomhmaking , like the bomb itself , is a creature of the MJCLEAR TERRORISM The United States is quietly arming itself against the threat of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ super-secret nuclear weapons and then decided in the late 1950s to tell the world about nuclear technology . The program , called " Atoms for Peace , " was President Dwight Eisenhower 's effort to turn atomic swords into industrial plowshares around the world , to " harness the atom " to spare the earth an energy crisis . Whatever the Atoms for Peace program did for international technology , it also spread nuclear physics far beyond a few scientists at the Manhattan Project . IRONICALLY , WHEN a noted physicist decided it was time to warn the world that this information was easily available for someonQ who wanted to terrorism . Tribune reporters have crisscrossed the country to interview government and civilian experts to determine how real the dangers are and how adequate the safeguards may be . This is the last of four reports . make a bomb , his hook also became one of the best sources of rudimentary bomb physics . The physicist , Theodore Taylor currently a member of the President 's commission investigating the accident at Three Mile Island , explains in " The Curve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could produce a variety of weapons using declassified AEC documents . Last year Pimitri Rowtow , a college physics dropout , testified before a Senate committee that he had obtained enough information to design roughly 50 types of nuclear bombs . His sources were the public library , " The Curve of Binding Energy , " and the public sections of the Energy De // Fiction and loose facts can help nuclear terrorist 's task // partment 's library at Los Alamos Scientific Laboratories , where many of the nation 's nuclear weapons are designed and built . THE DESIGNS Rowtow produced are now classified secret by the Department of Energy . Meanwhile , he is immersed in another controversy about whether documents he obtained from the Los Alamos library ? highly classified documents that turned out to have been accidentally placed on the shelves ? could be used by another nation to produce a hydrogen bomb . Rowtow was doing research for the American Civil Liberties Union , which is defending efforts by the Progressive Magazine , a Madison , Wis. , liberal publication , to publish a story on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has blocked publication of the article , copies reportedly have been circulating both in this country and abroad . Rowtow is one of several bright young men who have come up with bomb designs so sophisticated that the federal government has stepped in and classified their work to prevent it from falling into the hands of terrorists or other undesirables . John Phillips , a physics major at Princeton , was on the verge of flunking out of school when be came up with the idea of designing an atomic bomb for a class paper . Not only was Phillips ' bomb good enough to earnlim a passing grade , but also officials at the Department of Energy thought it was so good they ordered it classified . PAPERBACK RACKS are dotted with novels dwelling on nuclear security . Perhaps the most significant is one called " Gadget " by British mystery novelist Nicolas Freeling . " Gadget , " as , well as the word " widget , " are favorite physicists ' slang words for nuclear weapons . Freeling 's book is based on consultations with an unnamed nuclear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Atoms for Peace Program . The r.ovel tells how terrorists capture a physicist and force him to make a weapon with uranium stolen from a European processing plant a potential that offers thieves a tempting source of weapons-grade material . FREELING 'S CHARACTER casts the uranium into two pieces . One piece , called the core , is a cylinder with a hollow center . The second piece , " the ? bullet " is , milled to fit into the center of the core . Freeling 's scenario uses a 105 mm recoilless rifle to ram the bullet into the core and nitroglycerine wrapped around the device triggers the blast . The novel even advises would-be terrorists that they need a small quantity of lithium and polonium on the tip of the bullet to " initiate " the chain reaction required for a nuclear blast . Thus , for only $1.95 , one novel explains how to make a " gun type " nuclear weapon . Government officials will not say whether such a device would work . FOR THOSE interested in an " implosion " type device , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used ? by Freeling 's characters , there are such novels as . Lawrence Dunning 's " Keller 's Bomb , " in which another captured physicist uses two stainless steal salad bowls to mold the radioactive core of his bomb . " Keller 's Bomb " even provides advice for solving the vexing problem of how to obtain the uniform dynamite explosion needed to assure a nuclear explosion . Adventure novelist Alistair 's nuclear disaster novel , " Goodbye California , " suggests that once terrorists kidnap a physicist , they might consider detonating their device in the San Andreas fault , thereby getting more bang for their buck by creating an earthquake . Joseph ' DiMona , another best-selling writer , raises the idea of stealing nuclear weapons from the government as an alternative to the make-it-yourself types . His " The Benedict Arnold Connection " has a central character " nuking " the Atlantic seaboard in an effort to reform the federal intelligence community . SUCH INFORMATION ? especially the fiction variety ? probably could not lead a terrorist or a psychotic through the delicate technical process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure out how to make a legitimate-sounding threat . Energy Department officials say the growing spread of information about the basics of bomb construction is mating it extremely difficult to separate the hoaxers from those who might not be jok-ing : Currently , the FBI uses scientists from the Energy Department to decide whether the 25 to 35 nuclear threats received annually are " credible " ? that is , whether the writer really has the scientific knowledge to produce a bomb . TROY WADE , the No. 2 man at the Energy Department 's nuclear threat assessment unit , says the problem is figuring how much the person sending a threat actually knows . " What has he said ? " Wade says the units ask themselves . " Has he used the right word ? There has to be an added sophistication when the basic data is bandied about in cheap fiction . " Wade and many others acknowledge a change in the experts ' thinking about whether terrorists could mount a real nuclear threat . In the past , . officials of many agencies ? especially the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steal radioactive material , it would still be difficult to build a bomb . They would need sophisticated machine shops , glove boxes to handle the dangerous substances , and a refined skill in metallurgy , chemistry , mechanical design , nuclear physics , and other disciplines , these experts said . BY CONTRAST ; the Congressional Office of Technology Assessment IOTA ) in a recent study of nuclear terrorism concluded that terrorists would " not necessarily require a great deal of technological equipment . " " Only modest machine shop facilities that could be contracted for without arousing suspicion would be required " for a nuclear homemade bomb , OTA said . The congressional study added , " The group would have to include , at a minimum , a person capable of searching and understanding the technical literature in several fields and a jack-of-all-trades technician . " Today , when the antics of college students designing bombs in their dormitory rooms already have faded into yesterday 's news , when experts say that it is not impossible to translate the students ' drawings into nuclear reality , the strongest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tomorrow from obtaining the nuclear materials needed to make a bomb .
