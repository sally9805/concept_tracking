Electric cars are quiet , relatively un-polluting , and in theory can be as much as $500 a year cheaper to operate than conventional gasoline-burners . They also are generally heavier , slower and , most important , can run only 50 miles or so before they must be recharged . So far , those drawbacks have been fatal to the development of any large market . Since the early 1900s , the electric vehicle has been limited to such specialty uses as the beetle-like golf carts that purr around the nation 's fairways . Now that recent gasoline shortages have forced Americans to take a second look at their cars , at least four companies are gearing up for another try at developing a broader market . Before the year is out they will start manufacturing the first over-the-road electric cars produced in the U.S. in decades . <P> Sebring-Vanguard , Inc. , of Sebring , Fla. , hopes to be first out . It has beefed up a four-wheel golf-cart chassis , bolted on a snub-nosed auto body , and named the resulting vehicle CitiCar . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 30 m.p.h. over distances of 50 miles before needing a seven-hour recharge from household current . The car seats two people and consumes a little more than 1 kw-h per mile ( cost : about 2 at current utility rates in Florida ) . Twenty-five hundred CitiCars are expected to come off the assembly line by year 's end from a plant smaller than a football field . The suggested retail price will be a competitive $2,086 . Eager customers have already plunked down $20,000 in orders for the cars . Electromotion , of Bedford , Mass. , has already produced 50 electric cars that can be purchased for between $4,000 and $8,500 and will maintain a 40-m.p.h. speed for about 45 miles . <P> Taking a different tack , Electric Fuel Propulsion , Inc. , of Ferndale , Mich. , has designed the Thunderbolt , which uses a more powerful and longer lasting battery system than other electrics , enabling it to travel almost twice as far between recharges at speeds of up to 70 m.p.h . Complete recharging takes about 90 minutes ( special equipment and electric lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Most important , the Thunderbolt uses the body and other parts of standard-production Detroit automobiles , mounted on top of a special heavy-duty chassis . Main drawback : the price is a Cadillac-like $7,500 . <P> EVI , Inc. , of Sterling , Mich. , is taking another approach to the electric vehicle market . Aiming at retirement communities , for which it already produces a bicycle-type two-passenger pedal car , EVI plans to manufacture an electric version starting next fall . The Electric Powered Vehicle will be three-wheeled , travel at 25 m.p.h. for up to 45 miles between recharges , and cost under $1,200 . <P> Whether these four small companies ' efforts to produce an over-the-road electric car will succeed remains to be seen . In any case , their attempts will be closely watched . A host of large companies , including Otis Elevator , Westinghouse , several electric utilities and the big automakers , are waiting in the wings , ready to produce their own electric cars when-and if-a smaller pioneer proves that the market is there .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
