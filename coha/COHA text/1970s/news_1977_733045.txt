Ballots were counted secretly by union business agents and officers Wednesday , and the ban was overturned by slightly more than 300 votes . A source said only about 3,200 of the 9,000 eligible butchers voted in the mail referendum . Under an agreement reached with five major supermarket chains , to sell fresh meat each store must have a butcher on duty after 6 p.m. at premium overtime pay . The ban is scheduled to be lifted next Monday , the day before the mayoral primary . ACTING MAYOR Bilandic has used the long-standing curb on meat sales as a major political issue to show his ability to mediate with Chicago labor unions . With some arm twisting by Bilandic during three bargaining sessions in City Hall , both sides reluctantly agreed April 4 to submit the proposal to , the union membership although an identical proposal was rejected by a 4 to 1 margin in 1972 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Food Retailers Assn , refused to initial the pact , insisting that the anticipated increase in meat sales after 6 p.m , would not cover the added labor costs . However , the independent stores are expected to go along with after-6 sales for competitive reasons , with the result being increased meat prices , an industry source predicted . ALTHOUGH BUTCHERS interviewed before the vote overwhelmingly expressed opposition to any change in the existing three-year contract , business agents for four butcher locals in the Amalgamated Meat Cutters and Butcher Workmens Union campaigned strongly to end the ban , aiding Bilandic 's political prestige . One source said the vote to end the ban on night meat sales was 1,793 to 1,478 . Formal notices of the tally were expected to be mailed out Thursday to union members .

" Supermarket chains that initialed the agreement were Jewel , A &; P , Dominick 's , Hillman 's , and Kohl 's food stores , EXECUTIVES of the major chains and the Illinois Food Retailers Assn. declined to comment until they were assured by the union of the results and that the union members had been notified . Butchers , who average about an hour , were not concerned about overtime but strongly objectei , to working nights . One concern expressed by union leaders in the past was job security . Many butchers opposed night sales without a butcher on duty because of the fear that large food store chains would bring in meat cut and packaged on production lines and stocked by clerks . This , they said , could lead to the elimination of butchers ' jobs . DESPITE AN apparent mediation coup , Mayor Bilandic refused Thursday // City butchers lift after-6 meat sale ban // afternoon to acknowledge the reported vote results . " I do n't know what the results of the vote was , " Bilandic said . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's primary opponents attacked the count as a " sellout " of the union membership to enhance Bilandic 's campaign . " This is racketeering plain and simple , " said Democratic hopeful Anthony Martin-Trigona . " The ball o t boxes were stuffed to salvage Bilandic . " Another Bilandic rival , Aid .
