If visitors from China ever show up at an American college football game , one sight wo n't require an explanation - the half-time flash-card show . Reason : those sweeping murals created in the stands by massed thousands of people holding up brightly colored cards are also a feature of sports events in China The one big difference there is that instead of producing innocent U.C.L.A.s and expanding Stanford s 's , the Chinese concoct giant propaganda posters ( see color ) and execute them on a scale and with a precision-that is awesome . <P> That was evident in Peking recently at the Third National Games , a 17-day internal Chinese Olympics .

At least three world marks for pistol shooting were set . Not to mention standards for flash-card displays .
