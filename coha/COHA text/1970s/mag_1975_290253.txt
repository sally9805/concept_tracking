Despite a lack of public anxiety , demonstrated by the gutting of the oil conservation bill that finally passed the House last week , energy continues to bulk large in headlines in the U.S. and abroad . It remains the industrial world 's most nagging long-run economic headache . Last week President Ford moved to increase U.S. production of nuclear fuel , Britain celebrated the start of oil production under the North Sea , and a new study indicated that the money piling up in the treasuries of the 13 members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will remain a severe and highly unsettling problem for the rest of the world throughout the 1970s . Details : <P> End of a Monopoly ? <P> Ever since the beginning of the nuclear age , the U.S. Government has had a monopoly on the domestic manufacture of basic atomic fuel : enriched uranium. * But the Government 's three enrichment plants at Oak Ridge , Tenn. , Paducah , Ky. , and Portsmouth , Ohio , can not keep pace with the demands of proliferating nuclear power plants ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next 25 years . If the U.S. is not to lose the lion 's share of the lucrative nuclear-fuel market to foreign newcomers-the U.S.S.R. , France and others-the Federal Government must either build at least ten more enrichment plants or encourage private industry to do the job . Last week President Ford decided to ask Congress to give permission for private companies to produce and sell nuclear fuel . <P> Ford had in mind both ideology and costs . By the year 2000 , perhaps 50% of the nation 's electricity will be generated by atomic reactors , up from 5% today . Free-Marketeer Ford clearly does not want the Federal Government to retain a strangle hold over so great a portion of energy supplies . Moreover , to build ten new enrichment plants by 1990 would require a capital investment of about $30 billion . The President believes the Government has better uses for its money , especially since private industry wants to get into the nuclear-fuel business . Bechtel Corp . and Goodyear have already proposed one plant , and several other companies , including Exxon , Arco Electronucleonics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As an important side benefit , federal experts say , private companies can compete abroad for nuclear contracts more effectively than the Government . <P> Still , the legislation will have to be carefully designed if it is to get through Congress . Ford will first have to satisfy critics who fear that private industry might be lax about safety and security procedures in manufacturing and shipping the fissionable materials . But the situation is not quite as worrisome as it sounds . To use nuclear fuel in bombs would involve almost impossible effort and expense . Also , the Nuclear Regulatory Commission , which closely supervises all processes and shipments , will apply the same tough security and safety regulations to all future plants .
