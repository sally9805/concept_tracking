Angela in handcuffs remained no less enigmatic than Angela on the lam . <P> When FBI agents captured Angela Davis in a Manhattan motel last week , it seemed that the denouement of the mystery surrounding the striking , cerebral young radical might be near . Instead , the plot only thickened . Along with Angela , federal agents arrested David Poindexter , a black Chicagoan with known Communist ties . They also introduced another new , if slightly aging , character into the drama-the Communist Party , U.S.A. The result was a baffling mixture of Old Left and New , with Angela the pivotal figure . <P> Angela was wanted by California authorities for allegedly supplying the guns used by the kidnapers in last summer 's bloody Marin County courthouse shootout ( TIME , Aug. 24 ) . A onetime member of the Black Panther Party , she often traveled the state raising money and organizing the defense of the Soledad Three , a trio of blacks accused of killing a California prison guard . A frequent companion , Jonathan Jackson , was a leader in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black militant than a dialectician , Angela never made a secret of her Communist Party membership . She proclaimed it during her recent assistant professorship in philosophy at U.C.L.A. , which led the university 's board of regents to refuse renewal of her contract last year . Still , when Angela disappeared after the courthouse kidnaping , her Communist affiliation appeared unimportant . <P> Following her capture , however , the FBI alleged that Angela had been aided and sheltered by Communist Party members during her two months as a fugitive . According to FBI reports , Poindexter was introduced to Angela through a Communist contact on the West Coast , and agreed to aid her escape . The FBI also has the two turning up at Poindexter 's Chicago apartment and in Miami . In Chicago and Miami , the FBI says , they received money from the Communist Party apparatus .

Shortly afterward , during a news conference at Communist Party headquarters in Manhattan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ redundantly , that Angela was indeed a party member . <P> Subdued . Presumably , Angela 's alleged activities would have caused the party acute embarrassment . Last week a top FBI official said that violence and radical activity on campuses across the country are not connected to the Communist Party . And at his press conference , Hall denounced the Weathermen 's fall bombing offensive and said he was sure that Angela " would never engage in violence . " <P> Angela appeared subdued , almost timid at her arraignment in federal court on charges of unlawful flight to avoid prosecution for murder and kidnaping in California . She was later turned over to New York authorities to await a hearing next month on extradition to California . Says William Kunstler , a defense attorney in the Chicago conspiracy trial : " She now seems to be torn between the old-line theory and her friendship with black people . Remember , her education is all white-oriented-Brandeis , the Sorbonne , Marcuse .
