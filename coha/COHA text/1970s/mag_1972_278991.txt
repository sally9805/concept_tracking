After a week of petulant demands and infuriating delays , U.S. Grand Master Bobby Fischer , 29 , finally showed up in Reykjavik , Iceland , for his best-of-24-game match with World Champion Boris Spassky of the Soviet Union ( TIME , July 17 ) . But he was still bellyaching . He griped about the lights and the chessboard at Reykjavik 's Sports Hall , and he ordered his own $500 swivel chair to be air-freighted from the U.S. Even after the start of the first game - for which he arrived seven minutes late-he staged a 35-minute walkout because , he said , he was distracted by an almost invisible camera 150 ft. away . <P> In the end , Fischer 's juvenile act was a better show than the game itself . On the 29th move , Fischer took one of Spassky 's pawns-but it was a " poison pawn , " since its capture led to the loss of one of Fischer 's bishops . The audience gasped , and even the normally impassive Spassky looked incredulous . By common agreement , Fischer 's move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of grand-master chess . " A beginner 's blunder , " said one Fischer admirer-and 27 moves later , it cost Fischer the game . <P> The next day Fischer refused to show up at the Sports Hall and forfeited the second game . After that , he threatened to boycott the rest of the match unless all cameras were removed , although he had agreed to the cameras beforehand-and , like Spassky , was set to receive 30% of the sale of film and TV rights . He later relented on that score , but continued to insist on another chance to play the second game , a demand chess officials refused to grant . Given Bobby 's stubbornness and short-fused temper , not even the experts could predict the next move .
