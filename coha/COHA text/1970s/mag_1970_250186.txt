As the strike of a twelve-union coalition against General Electric Co. wore on through 14 weeks , the outcome began to seem inevitable . Many of the 130,000 strikers were as united in bitterness against their employer as any band of workers who fought the U.S. industrial class wars of the 1930s . Corporations rarely win that kind of struggle today . Last week G.E . agreed with the two leading unions on contract terms that should permit a resumption of work within a few days-and will further fire inflation in the nation . <P> The proposed pact will raise wages and benefits more than 25% over the next 40 months , or about 8% a year . Workers who averaged $3.25 an hour in wages before the strike will get an increase of 20 immediately , 15 more in 1971 and another 15 in 1972 . A cost-of-living escalator clause and changes in pension , sick leave , vacation and other benefits could bring the total cost by some estimates to 88 an hour . That is the kind of settlement that G.E . probably could have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not have got from G.E.-without a strike . <P> The Nixon Administration and the national economy are among the losers . Administration officials have vowed to avoid arm-twisting intervention in labor disputes , and they kept their pledge during the G.E . battle . The strike was the first important test of the Administration 's hope that an intensifying profit squeeze would force corporate executives to resist union demands for ever higher wage increases-and that union leaders eventually would settle for pay raises smaller than the inflationary ones they won last year . Instead , the G.E . boost is right in line with the 8.2% wage and benefit increase provided by major contracts negotiated in 1969 . Such an increase , granted by one of the nation 's hardest-bargaining employers , may well embolden other union leaders to hold out for hefty increases in different labor negotiations later this year . <P> Them v. Us . The G.E . struggle can not be regarded simplistically as a battle of greedy workers v. inflation-fighting executives . In the minds of the strikers , the primary issue was not even economic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its bargaining strategy of " Boulwarism , " named after Lemuel Boulware , G.E . ' s labor relations chief in the 1950s . Boulwarism calls for management to make and stick to an initial " firm , fair " offer to employees and to attempt to convince workers of the offer 's merits by conducting vigorous " employee marketing " campaigns . Union loyalists have long regarded this strategy as an attempt by the company to fix wage rates unilaterally , but the many unions representing G.E . workers were too divided to challenge the tactic effectively . Then last fall they formed a coalition and won the unconditional support of the whole labor movement for a battle to the end . <P> In Schenectady , N.Y. , a city of 71,000 where G.E . maintains its biggest plant complex , the strike from its outset was a kind of holy war . Many of the Italian-Polish-and German-descent members of International Union of Electrical Workers ' Local 301 are second-or third-generation laborers in the heavy-equipment plants . They speak a language of " them " and " us " that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
