Poa annua and poa Jack . It was that kind of a week down in ol ' Augusta . Poa annua , honey , been gone for so long , galavantin ' around the countryside . Get in that kitchen and fix up those biscuits . Get off those greens you done made slicker ' n Sam Snead 's head , and you stop botherin ' Jack Nicklaus . And Jack , you come in this house . Land sakes if you 're not out there acting like you never been here before . Out there playin ' against yourself and the record book and Bobby Jones and all that nonsense instead of just settlin ' down and winnin ' this old Masters Tournament by 25 or 30 strokes like you supposed to do . You ought to be ashamed of yourself , Jack Nicklaus . And Poa annua , you just shut up and get in there with the pans . // That 's how it was . Poa annua and Jack Nicklaus in the Masters all week long . Poa annua is that weed grass that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and turn the Masters greens blotchy . It makes the greens uneven , bumpy , fast , unpredictable , unreadable and it sends the scores soaring higher than Nicklaus ' career . And who is Jack Nicklaus ? Well , he 's more than ever the greatest golfer of our time ; for after beating everybody else , last week he proved that he can even beat himself . He must be the toughest opponent he 's ever faced . // Think of it this way . Jack Nicklaus won the Masters this time by three strokes in a manner that would do honor to all the crippled and wounded of highway intersections everywhere . But the thing is , Jack was supposed to win the Masters more than he was ever supposed to win it before . And , believe it or not , that makes it harder . Everybody sits around and talks about how the pros really get uptight over all the money they play for , but that is a myth that can be filed away with people who claim they see a goal scored in ice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his aspirations , immortality , eternity , the Grand Slam , his own private ambitions , and even his own embarrassment is a man who has chosen a pretty strong lineup of opponents . Jack Nicklaus was such a person last week , and that is the only thing that made the Masters as close as it was . // That 's what made Nicklaus come limping down the stretch over those last few holes , trying to play it cozy , trying not to let the Masters slip away to some guy who did n't want it in the first place . He went to the 11th hole of the last round with a five-stroke lead on the pack , which included somebody named Jim Jamieson , and he was supposed to get you excited ? You 've got to be drunker than most everybody under the umbrellas on the veranda . // Nicklaus was only worried about fate , a weird fate that would keep him from winning his fourth Masters , the 12th major championship of his life , moving him up ahead of Walter Hagen and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also put him another step closer to being , beyond any logical argument , the greatest golfer who ever lived , overlapped , interlocked or putting on Poa annua. // Fate tried hard , of course . It grabbed hold of Jack and made him three-putt the 11th hole for a bogey , three-putt the 13th for a par , three-putt the 14th for another bogey and , the third day in a row , play the 15th hole like a guy trying to move the hot dog to the hand with the binoculars in it . The 15th is a par-5 hole that Nicklaus could go back out to right now and with nothing but a driver and four-iron  --  forget the putter , he 'll kick the ball  --  play four balls and make three fours and a three . // Put him in the Masters , though , and throw all that immortality up against him , plus the fact that he 's going to be so humiliated if he does n't win , and he 'll go out there and make a seven on Friday , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a six , always hitting some kind of second shot that threatens to bounce clear to the parking lot . // The fact is that the Augusta National course with its ruined greens played so difficult last week  --  the most difficult since 1966 , when Nicklaus last won  --  that Jack could lead the field all the way after an opening 68 and afford the luxury of going 36 holes on Saturday and Sunday in three over par . // If Nicklaus ' winning total of 286  --  only two under par  --  was not proof enough of the sad greens , how about the fact that only three other players broke 290 , and one of them was Jamieson ? His main claims to fame are that he comes from Illinois , across the river from Jack Fleck , and that he works with a set of clubs that includes a couple of Pings , three Spaldings , three Power-Bilts , a Hagen , a Hogan , three Golfcrafts and a putter he bought in a department store in Orlando . // It was an old-fashioned Masters , actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind , some chilly weather , a low round by Sam Snead , a hole in one by Charles Coody on Billy Joe Patton 's 6th hole , the high scores , a variety of double bogeys and a few triple bogeys. // Constantly the big leader boards argued with one 's intellect , especially on the first day , the most exciting of all : Snead , a 59-year-old man with a putting style that looks as if he 's bending over to tie his shoe , had a 69 . Then Coody with his hole in one at the 6th to put him four under par . So on the next hole he takes four shots  --  in the same bunker . Finally , Nicklaus , looking like the player he is . His eagle 3 at the 15th took command . // From this point on the only question that remained was whether Nicklaus would whip himself . Slowly , the Poa annua would take everybody out of it , forcing three-putt greens , making recovery chips and pitches next to impossible . Nicklaus succeeded because just enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // His driving was good , but his irons were unsettling , and his recovery shots were pretty awful . What kept him on top was his attitude , his ability to smile at his own mistakes , his refusal to become demoralized by the Poa annua and the short putts he missed . // " Trying to play safe is the worst thing in the world , " Nicklaus said . " I do n't think I would have looked so bad there at the last if I 'd been forced to throw the ball at the hole . When you start playing safe .... " // Jack admitted he had become a bit testy over the constant badgering he got about the Grand Slam , and the fact that his legs were never working right on his iron shots . // " You come here to savor the Masters , " he said . " It stands alone . I do n't think about winning the Masters as part of the Slam . You want to win the Masters because of what it means to the game ; what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the problem with the legs . There was wind and when there 's wind you do n't use the legs as much ; you swing more stiffly , occasionally eliminating the full follow-through . Each night Jack practiced until almost dark , testing . // " I 've played better here and did n't win , but the course changes and the field changes , " he said . // One change in this year 's field was that it included Lee Trevino , who became a part of the proceedings even though he played golf like one of the aging members on the tour . He had not been to Augusta in two years and he had said a lot of things about the place . Clifford Roberts , chairman of the Augusta National Golf Club , cooled him , delightfully . After his third round , Trevino went to the press building and did his usual comic routine , but as he was leaving Roberts approached . Trevino stopped for a radio interview . Roberts stood by . It seemed obvious that he was waiting for Lee , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweet time . // Roberts finally left , wandering up the hill to the clubhouse . Lee started up the same hill and as he passed Roberts ' office , Cliff stepped outside . Whether he noticed Roberts or not , Trevino kept walking . But a club member on Trevino 's left hollered to him , pointing at Roberts . The two shook hands and Cliff said , " Have you got a half minute ? " // " I got to do a TV thing , " said Trevino. // There was an awkward pause and eventually the TV man said , " I 'll wait . " // Whereupon Roberts put his arm around Trevino and they walked into Roberts ' office . They stayed there about 25 minutes and came out together . They walked up the driveway and into the main entrance to the clubhouse and into the Trophy Room where they stood and chatted about Bobby Jones ' old clubs in the glassed-in case . // " He only hit two shots with the sand wedge , " said Cliff , talking about Jones . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rocks , " said Trevino. // They chatted on and on , amid laughter and in a perfectly friendly atmosphere . And Trevino said he would definitely return to the Masters . // Roberts said , " I was decidedly charmed by that fellow . One of the nicest things about this week is that we 've got our relationship straightened out . " // And Trevino said , " I really enjoyed that . He 's a nice man . " // The attention paid to Trevino just went to prove how times have changed . Somehow it seemed that Augusta 's alltime favorite , Arnold Palmer , was not fawned over as in the past . The crowds were his , of course , but Palmer had a ruling go against him , something that might not have happened for a long time . It occurred on the second day and it not only cost him a stroke but catapulted him into such a bad frame of mind it probably cost him the triple bogey that took him out of contention . // At the 9th hole on Friday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depression caused by a chair seat by the green . He thought he deserved a free lift . He played his ball and made a bogey 5 . He next played a provisional ball and made a par . He then went to the back nine , the incident under review . // What angered him was that he knew , or believed he knew , that the chair had been occupied by a tournament official . If so , he reasoned , it was no different from a TV tower or something you can freely drop away from . The full rules committee said no , and this news was delivered on the 12th tee , before Palmer was about to play the most dangerous hole on the course , that marvelous par-3 over Rae 's Creek . Palmer promptly hit an eight-iron into the front bunker , hit the bunker shot over the green , slashed back across the green into the front bunker again , blasted out and missed a three-foot putt for a triple-bogey 6 . He snarled all the way  --  about the ruling , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the eight years since he last won a Masters . // Meanwhile , Nicklaus was left to join Palmer as the only other four-time Masters winner . And in so doing Jack established himself as a man who has now taken the tournament in just about every conceivable way . He took it coming down the stretch by a stroke . That was when he first won it , nine years ago , over Tony Lema . He won it by shooting records , a 64 and a 271 and by nine strokes . That was in 1965 . He won in a playoff , and back to back , in 1966 . And now he has won it clumsily , with a 68-71-73-74 , frightened only of destiny and that old honey child , Poa annua. // And , of course , frightened by himself . The toughest opponent he has ever had to face .
