Womb of campus riots of the sixties . Vortex of black power , brown power , red power , gay power , and power to the people . At eight o'clock on the night of Feb. 4 , 1974  --  a ** Peter Benenson , mathematician at Berkeley 's radiation laboratory , was just able to buy his weekly supply of groceries before the Berkeley Co-op Market 's closing time . He bundled up the two bulging brown paper bags and started for his 10-year-old Chevy convertible in the , parking lot . There was a sudden rush of sound at his side . " Shut up , do n't make a sound ! Do what you 're told and you wo n't get hurt ! " Hands grabbed his wrists and pulled his arms behind him , and he felt the sting of cord binding his hands together . He was dumped down onto the rear floorboards . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came another hissed warning . Three people got into the car . The key turned , the engine sputtered to life , and Peter Benenson was driven off into Berkeley 's flatland to a driveway in front of a modern brown-shingled fourplex at 2603 Benvenue AV. , a short distance south of the University of California campus . IF BENENSON bad looked up , he would have seen a white woman and two black men slide out of his car . They were going into combat . The woman 's slim body was hidden in the tattered folds of a long dress that brushed against the scuffed boots . Ifer face was hidden behind her long black hair . She moved quickly , fluidly , only her right arm staying rigid , her hand beneath the folds of the dress clutching a .38 automatic revolver . Both men held automatic rifles pressed tight across their chests . THE TALLER man had wide , flared nostrils and a mouth thick with bitterness . He pressed his narrow shoulders flat against the brown shingles and looked over his shoulder . lie could see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the night . A dark blue Volkswagen was behind it , Rs driver also screened by darkness . Ills comrades were waiting , ready for the start of the " combat action . " The two men looked at the woman ; she nodded and slid forward past the small screen of bamboo into the patch of light from the front door of Apartment 4 , They had reached their target : the apartment where Patricia Campbell licarst lived with Steven Weed . Weed stretched out on the long sofa , leaned back and Soaked up the sound from the stereo . Upstairs Patty Hearst stepped out of her shower and started toweling her slim fivefoot , three-inch frame . Her long , light-brown hair turned up at the ends from the steam . She slipped into a pair of nylon underpants , pulled on the dark blue robe from I. Magnin 's exclusive fashion shop , and passed back down the shiny hardwood stairs to Steve . TIIERE WAS a rap , a gentle one , almost unheard among the sounds of the stereo . But Steve heard it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the screen door outside it was already ajar . The woman 's head hung down , her face hidden behind the black hair , her voice muffled in its thickness . " Had accident in car  --  need phone . " He did n't get the opportunity to refuse her admittance . Before the woman had finished her mumbled words , two men jumped from behind the potted bamboo plants and crashed into the doorway , sending Steve sprawling onto the floor . He had only a glimpse ? " But that 's all I needed . I could see the long barrels of guns across their chests . I thought , ' Oh , God , we 're being robbed . ' " " KEEP YOUR face down or you 're dead ! " the taller man snarled into Weed 's face , as he shoved it into the cool hardwood floor . " I laid there , he kicked me , punched me . I could feel him tying my hands behind my back . I thought , ' My God , why do n't they just rob @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them grab Patty 's wallet with her credit cards out of her purse . They took my passport too . I thought we 'd die . " " I felt this blow  --  it crashed into my skull again and again . The blood was running down my face into my eyes . He was beating me with a full bottle of wine Patty and I had on the bookshelf near the front door . I hear d Patty struggling , screaming , then whimpering in the kitchen just a few feet from me . Then I heard the woman 's voice say , ' Shut up or we 'll have to hurt you . ' " That 's when it hit me : ' This is no robbery . They are Peter Benenson , also kidnaped by Patty 's abductors , had to lie on his car floor while auto was used in  --  esenpe. doing something else , not robbing us . ' " " I KNEW THEY 'D kill me ? I had nothing to lose now , so I jumped up , screaming . I just ran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , overturning the lamps , anything at all , screaming , screaming all the time . I saw that tall black man standing there , watching me run around like a crazy man screaming . Ile had the rifle pointed straight at me  --  he could pull that trigger at any time . But lie just stood there , almost smiling . " I did n't scream words , not like help or police , just sounds ? just screams . I did n't know what to do ? I was almost crzy . Then I saw them , the white woman and the shorter black man . They had Patty . She was still struggling , but they were carrying her out the ball . out to the front door . " That 's when I ran out the back door , still screaming . Somehow , while I was the madman in the living room , I had worked my hands free . I ? ran across the backyard , over the fence . I do n't know where or when I stopped running or when I stopped screaming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later , and neighbors finally calmed Steve Weed enough to silence his screams and stop his naming . Neighbors heard the screams anti the crashings and rushed toward the apartment to help . A young Asian was grabbed as he came around the corner from his front apartment . The tall black man grabbed him , slammed him into the floor . Two young women living directly next door rushed out their sliding glass . front door . They saw Patty struggling , her robe ripped from her breasts .

THE THREE figures in combat boots rushed toward the waiting convertible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shuddered on the floorboards . The trunk lid flew open , Patricia Hearst was thrown inside , and the lid slammed down . Benenson felt the car rock from the sudden weight in the trunk . He 'd also heard the crack of bullets . The doors were flung open , the three jumped inside . The car span out of the driveway , raced toward Derby Street , which leads into the Berkeley foothills . The old white Chevy station wagon roared off behind the kidnap car , the dark blue Volkswagen right behind it . Two blocks away , the threecar caravan , with its cargo of two victims , slowed to normal speed , all eyes watching the side streets and looking behind them . They swung around a side drive and turned into blocklong Tanglewood Drive . ALL THREE cars slowed , then stopped . Peter Benenson had now been rolled around his own floorboards for an hour and a half . He heard the trunk of his car snap open , felt the convertible 's gentle roll as a weight was lifted out of it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stay clown , stay put , and you wo n't get hurt ! Look up and you 're dead ! " He did n't look up . If he had , he might have seen the nolonger-struggling form of the half-naked Patty Hearst being carried to the waiting station wagon ant then dumped inside by the two black men . The woman from the combat trio jumped into the wagon , the two men raced to the Volkswagen , and both cars drove off . He waited minutes , hours . HE CRAWLED , fell , pulled , until he was out of the car . At the other end of Berkeley , lie reached his sister 's house . She asked if he wanted the police . He looked at her and said , " No , I ca n't . They 'd kill me . " So it would be dawn before police found the empty convertible with its trunk standing open on Tanglewood Drive .
