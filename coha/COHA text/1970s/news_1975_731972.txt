txt Like New York , many large cities across the nation are in financial trouble , but their troubles are generally much less severe . The chief reasons , as disclosed by an examination of the budgets of other cities and by interviews with experts on municipal finance , are these : ( Most other cities that were faced with a dramatically widening gap between expenditures and revenues made major cutbacks in city payrolls or raised taxes , or both . Cleveland appears to be a significant exception . 9No other city has relied as heavily as New York on extremely short-term borrowing , particularly in the form of " anticipation " securities . These are bonds or notes that will be paid off out of revenues yet to he collected  --  that is , out of anticipated tax collections , state aid payments - or specified fees . The holders of anticipation securities have the top priority claim to the proceeds of these future revenue collections . Actually , New York City 's financial troubles appear to have Come as no surprise to students of municipal finance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1973 and based on data for 1971 , identified five symptoms of unhealthy financial condition and found that New York City had four of them . The study was done by the SHANAHAN New York Times Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations , a permanent organization whose members come from Federal and state and local governments . The study , written in characteristically restrained bureaucratic prose , did not sound any alarms concerning New York or anywhere else . It merely recited the symptoms of vulnerability to financial emergency , and detailed which cities were displaying which ones . Those exhibited by New York were the following : ( Current expenditures that exceed receipts by more than 5 per cent . ( Deficits in each of the preceding two years . ! Deficit in the general fund under a uniform bookkeeping system known as the " cash basis . " ! Short-term loans outstandcolumn missing The principal city services that have been cut back because of layoffs include trasn collections , street cleaning and maintenance and park maintenance . Buffalo has cut out one fire company and reduced the number .. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brief sketches of the fiscal picture in some major cities : CLEVELAND Although Vincent Campanella the budget director , will not admit to any such thing , a glance at the evidence puts Cleveland on the list of cities with serious financial problems . The ratio of the city 's debt service to its current budget expenditures is 17.9 per cent , somewhat higher than New York 's . The report on " city financial emergencies " identified Cleveland as a problem city at least as far back as 1970 or 1971 , when the voters refused to approve an income tax increase and , nearly simultaneously , let a special property tax levy expire . Municipal services were cut ? but not enough to avoid a deficit that required the city to get permission from the state legislature to issue a special type of debt security , similar to the widely criticized anticipation notes . " Cleveland 's financial emergency stemmed from its citizens ' own choosing , " the advisory commission report said , and continued deficits appear to be what Clevelanders are still choosing . Last November , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ income tax that would have applied to all who work in the city , resident and nonresident alike . The defeat of the tax-increase proposal has led to layoffs of about .1,120 city workers , 10 per cent of the total , but that will save only 86-million or $9-million , not quite halving the prospective deficit . Meanwhile , the city continues to issue new batches of the special 5-year notes in amounts that have been increasing by about $20-million a year . Mr. Campanella says they can be paid off at the present property tax rate . MILWAUKEE The residents of only two of the nation 's 30 largest cities ? Boston and Milwaukee  --  pay more in state and local taxes of all kinds than do the residents of New York . Yet despite its high tax rates , particularly for those with incomes of $155 , - 000 or more , Milwaukee may be headed for financial problems . The ratio of the city 's debt service to its current budget expenditures is 15.2 per cent , into the range that " warrants concern " in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ according to Edwin C. Whitney , the city 's director of budget and ' management . The firefighters just got a big raise and the issue of police salaries is now in arboration . State aid to the city is likely to be down because of the recession . Street-cleaning crews have been put on a shorter work year , as the only major economy so far . But Mr. Whitney believes the city " may lace massive layoffs " of municipal workers next year . DETROIT Faced with a drastic decline in municipal revenues as a result of its unemployment rate ? the highest , by far , for any major city  --  Detroit has re ? sponded with drastic layoffs of municipal workers and with other economies . The city chronically runs a deficit ? in fact , it has recorded only four years without a deficit in the last 25 . It is some ? what surprising . therefore , that the ratio of the city 's debt service payments to its budget expenditures is still under per cent . However , the city looks less healthy financially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York , Detroit issues revenue-anticipation notes , though the amount is under stricter control by the state . It is the reduction in personnel costs that constitutes the dramatic part of Detroit 's response to its fiscal problems . Some 1,980 workers , 10 per cent of the city payroll , will have been laid off between February and the end of the fiscal year , June 30 . In addition , the city is trying to cut its payrolls by another 1,200 by not filling vacancies . The city is trying to get its municipal employes unions to agree to cutbacks in work and pay , such as accepting straight time pay for holidays , that would reduce payroll costs by 8 per cent , which is the equivalent of 1,500 jobs . All these reductions would produce a cut of 24 per cent in city payrolls . BUFFALO With an unemployment rate ! close to 20 per cent , Buffalo is ' on everybody 's list of cities in I serious financial trouble . In the 11974-75 fiscal year , which ends June 30 , the city will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ current budget , mainly because it will collect ' considerably less revenue than it originally expected . Philip Cook , the budget di , rector , said that delinquencies in property tax collections , considered by some experts to be an unfailing sign of serious distress , amounted to more than 8 per cent and were " running higher now than at any time since the Great Depression and rising every month . " The de ' linquency rate runs around 2 or 3 per cent in prosperous tittles . ' The ratio of the city 's dept service to its budget expenditures is 12.1 per cent and an unusually high proportion of its present and immediately ' prospective debt is short term . Buffalo has moved against its financial problems on both the tax and the expenditure sides of its budget . An increase in the property tax rate was put into effect last year : lay- ' offs totaling 16 per cent of the payroll have been made over the last four years . BOSTON The residents of Boston pay higher combined state and local taxes than the residents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Of Boston 's total revenue , 70 per . cent comes from the property tax which is , by far , the highest in the nation , compared with something under 40 per cent for most cities . And property tax delinquencies in Boston have been creeping up to the point where Richard E. Wall . the budget director . thinks they may reach 10 per cent by the end of the fiscal year , June 30 . The original budget estimates assumed a delinquency rate of 6 per cent ? a $14-million difference . The city has reduced payrolls by 10 per cent over the last two years , with the Hospital Department bearing about half the cut . For the new fiscal year . spending is expected to rise by about $80-million to $600-million , and where the extra money is coming from is none too clear . ST . LOUIS In its new fiscal year that began May 1 , St. Louis faced the prospect of a budget deficit of $20-million , which would have violated state law . To fill the gap , it has proposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jack A. Webber believes will not be approved , plus a 4 per cent cutback in city jobs , which comes on top of a 7 per cent cutback over the preceding four years . Street cleaning , recreation and services ' and park maintenance would be reduced . In addition , St. Louis will juggle its payrolls to save $4.1-million that it would otherwise owe its workers , who are paid biweekly , because 1975-76 is a 27-payday year for people who are paid on Fridays . The payday will be slipped forward one day next year and in each of six succeeding years until , finally , there will actually be a 27-payday year . But by then there will be money in a special fund to take care of the extra payday . SEATTLE The current unemployment rate of 9 per cent looks good to Seattle , where almost 20 per cent of the working force were jobless only a few years ago after the collapse of the aerospace industry . That industry has recovered and Seattle is also benefiting from its position as a shipping point for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gross re . ceipts tax on business and its excise levy on utility bills on Jan. 1 . Both taxes are bringing in more money than estimated , with the result that the city may run a surplus this year . Contract negotiations with major groups of city employes and a possible resumption of deficit financing loom for next year , however . Seattle 's debt service payments are 9.4 per cent of its current budget expenses .
