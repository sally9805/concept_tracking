txt Foreign Minister Andrei A. Gromyko of the Soviet Union said today that his Government opposed acts of terrorism and " acts of violence that serve no positive ends and cause loss of human life . " Speaking before the General Assembly , Mr. Gromyko singled out the Palestinian guerrillas for mention . He said : " It is certainly impossible to condone the acts of terrorism committed by certain elements from among the participants in the Palestinian movement that have led , notably , to the recent tragic events in Munich . " Their criminal actions deal a blow also at the national interests and aspirations of the Palestinians ; these acts are used by the Israeli criminals in order to cover up their policy of banditry against the Arab peoples . " Mr. Gromyko also addressed himself to the question of ter // rorism in general : " The Soviet Union , from positions of principle , opposes acts of terrorism that disrupt the diplomatic activity of states and their representatives , transport ties between them and the normal course of international contacts and meetings . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Maurice Schumann , Foreign Minister of France . The general debate lasts for two and a half weeks and each of the 132 members is given an opportunity to have a speaker , often the foreign minister , address the Assembly on any matter he wishes . Mr. Schumann also spoke on the issue of terrorism and praised Secretary General Waldheim for his initiative in placing the matter before the United Nations because " it aims to break the merciless chain of indiscriminate violence . " While a part of Mr. Gromyko 's speech appeared to reflect the improved relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union , much of it took a hard line toward the United States . Mr. Gromyko 's harsh words on Vietnam ? much harsher than those used before the Assembly last year  --  appeared intended to convey a message to so-called third-world countries that China was not alone in maintaining a firm attitude toward the United States . " The continuance and expansion of the American intervention in Vietnam and other countries of Indochina provokes indignation and condemnation , " Mr. Gromyko said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made promising to leave Vietnam and to stop the war as have been made of late . And never before has there been so striking a contrast between words and deeds . " Mr. Gromyko spoke of what he termed a resort to " manipulations " with reports about reductions in the United States military strength in Vietnam . He said that the aim had been to reassure the public , " but behind them all is in fact an unprecedented expansion of the acts of war , and of their cruelty and inhumanity . " The Foreign Minister said : " One can only wonder why the one and only correct conclusion has not been drawn yet , namely , that the Vietnamese people can not be defeated . Their stanchness will not be broken either by heavier bombing , or by the blockade of their ports , or by damage to their hydrotechnical installations . " Mr. Schumann , also speaking on Indochina , said : " Will the moment never come when our organization can put into operation a vast effort of solidarity on behalf of peoples who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the more dear to us because they are suffering so unjustly ? " He said , " The opportunity to bring to Indochina a peace whose political and military terms can be equally perceived is now at hand ; I do not want to believe that this opportunity will again be passed up . " A major part of Mr. Gromyko 's speech was addressed to a draft resolution he submitted on the " renunciation of the use or threat of force in international relations and the permanent prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons . " Under the proposed plan , the General Assembly would approve the resolution on the premise that the renunciation of the use or threat of force and the prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons should become a law of international life . Then the Security Council , meeting at the level of foreign ministers , would convene and make a decision that would be legally binding on all United Nations members . The plan was met with much skepticism by Western delegates . One said it appeared to be an easy propaganda tactic that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of the angels but that in fact was so nonspecific that it added up to nothing . " Mr. Gromyko 's appearance was the occasion for even more stringent security precautions than those already in effect here . Threats of violence were telephoned to the Soviet Mission today . There was also a demonstration near the United Nations by Jewish groups protesting the treatment of Soviet Jews . As a result , Mr. Gromyko was brought into the General Assembly building through the garage underneath the United Nations Headquarters . When he started to speak only 21 carefully screened public spectators were allowed in the upper public gallery of the hall and they were carefully watched during his speech by uniformed United Nations guards . While the speech was in progress , 10 more spectators , also carefully screened , were admitted to the gallery .. Meanwhile , the Legal Committee again considered the priority to be given to consideration of the terrorism issue . Arab and Arrican countries tvant to defer discussion until December ; the United States wants immediate consideration . The European group , with Canada , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the issue to be introduced in late October or early November .
