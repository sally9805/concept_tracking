MAHOGANY Directed by BERRY GORDY Screenplay by JOHN BYRUM <P> So it should n't be a total loss , Mahogany contains one pearl : a romantic interlude between Diana Ross and Anthony Perkins . Ross appears as Tracy , a poor girl from the Chicago ghetto who has made it big as a model in Rome . Perkins plays Sean , a former combat correspondent who has made it big as a fashion photographer . Sean 's sexuality remains moot through much of the film - until the moment when he forces a chilly Tracy down on a bed and mutters , " I understand the needs of a woman . " <P> Cut to next scene : a tight closeup of Perkins lying wide-eyed and morose , staring at the ceiling . Ross raises herself on one elbow and consoles him with the hollow reassurance of a nurse returning doom-laden X rays . " Do n't worry , " she sighs , " it 's not the most important thing in the world . " <P> The equally unimportant Mahogany , blatantly concocted as a sequel to Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great deal to John Schlesinger 's Darling ( 1965 ) . Indeed , its debt is so considerable that Perkins , who performs with wit , takes to addressing Miss Ross as " D-a-r-r-1-l-i-n-n-g , " stretching the syllables to the breaking point . Miss Ross , however , is no Julie Christie . She may be more persuasive as the fictive Tracy than as the authentic Billie Holiday . But she remains an uneasy actress who pushes everything past endurance - including the audience . Ross laughs eagerly but never with a semblance of spontaneity , weeps without sorrow and rages without passion . <P> Movies as frantically bad as Mahogany can be enjoyed on at least one level : the spectacle of a lot of people making fools of themselves . The film marks the directorial debut of Berry Gordy , the Motown Records whiz , who has slapped scenes together as if he were laying down tracks for an album : one fast , one slow , one happy , one sad , one up , one down . Gordy has also permitted Miss Ross to design her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some Oriental version of Star Trek . <P> The movie comes down hard on the notion of its heroine 's overweening ambition and demonstrates that a good girl has no time for all those fancy European airs when she could be back in the ghetto , helping her man ( the agreeable Billy Dee Williams ) win political office . For Mahogany , that kind of moral-cynical , and wholly bogus-is the perfect clincher . Jay Cocks <P>
