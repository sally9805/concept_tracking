txt Israel promptly accepted President Anwar el-Sadat 's invitation tonight to come to Cairo so that all parties to the Israeli-Arab dispute can plan for substantive peace talks at Geneva . Shortly after a meeting called by Prime Minister Menahem Begin that included Foreign Minister Moshe Dayan , Deputy Prime Minister Yigael Yadin , Defense Minister Ezer Weizman and other key Cabinet officials , a Government spokesman said : " After the official invitation reaches Jerusalem , the Government will decide whom to appoint to represent it at the Cairo talks . " The brief response seemed to imply that acceptance of the invitation , in the wake of Mr. Sadat 's extraordinary visit to Israel a week ago , was never in doubt . The United States reacted with caution to the Sadat invitation , admitting that the time and place had come as a surprise . Page 17 . Israeli Leader Invited to Cairo According to an initial understanding here , the invitation , proffered by Mr. Sadat during a speech today to the Egyptian Parliament concerning his Israeli trip , will be conveyed by Egypt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , parties involved in convening the Geneva talks . The inference being drawn here was that the initial talks , at least , would be at the Foreign Ministry level and that Israel 's representative would ? be Mr. Dayan . But events have moved so swiftly in recent days that a visit by Mr. Begin himself was not being ruled out . When the Egyptian and Israeli ' leaders ' met here last week at a huge press conference , they said that the Egyptian-Israeli dialogue , begun after 29 years of war and hostility , would continue . Mr. Sadat also invited Mr. Begin to Cairo , but both leaders said the actual visit would be deferred . In accepting the invitation to " a Cairo conference , " the Begin Government noted that Mr. Sadat had reiterated the Arab world 's demand for a withdrawal by Israel to the borders it had before the 1967 war , and its acceptance of a Palestinian state . Both demands , the statement said , contradicted the nearunanimous resolution of the 120-member Israeli Parliament , and added that its resolution remained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statement also noted that Israel and Egypt had agreed to negotiate their differences without prior conditions . Mr. Sadat 's speech to his legislature had hardly ended before several members of the Israeli Parliament with whom Mr. Sadat had met earlier this week sent mes // sages to the Israeli Prime Minister urging speedy acceptance of the invitation to attend the Cairo meeting . Officials interviewed tonight were evenly divided on whether Mr. Begin or ' any of his chief aides had advance knowledge of Mr. Sadat 's latest move . Analysts here viewed Mr. Sadat 's calling of a Cairo conference as more of an overture to the Arab world , where there is strong disapproval of his Israeli trip , than to Israel itself . The speech was also seen by some . Israeli analysts of Middle East politics as a shrewd move to play down the role of the United States and the Soviet Union deliberations aimed at finding a way ' to go to Geneva with substantive gains . Prof. Shlomo Shamir , an Arab affairs expert from . the University of Tel Aviv , said that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , point for the Egyptian leader . He also felt . the speech reflected Mr. Sadat 's " disappointment " in bigpower attempts to convene peace talks , particularly those of the United States , which has made a ma4or effort to call a Geneva parley by the end of the year . . second analyst , Prof. Shlomo Avineri , until recently the director general of Israel 's Foreign Ministry , said Mr. Sadat 's speech had moved the efforts for peace into " high gear , " and that , through the speech , he had put " quite a lot of pressure on the Arab countries now . " Mr. Avineri said he was particularly interested in seeing how Saudi Arabia would act now , even though it was not a direct party to the peace talks with Israel as are Egypt , Syria , Jordan and perhaps Lebanon . Mr. Avineri said the situation was both pleasant and difficult for Israel , in that the Jewish state was now in direct talks with an Arab power but may , have to negotiate without direct American support er @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arguing that Mr. Sadat seemed to be trying to avoid a situation where the big powers , in particular the Soviet Union , with whom Egypt 's ? relations are strained , would be jockeying for a position to impose a Middie East solution from outside ? an eventuality Israel has long resisted .
