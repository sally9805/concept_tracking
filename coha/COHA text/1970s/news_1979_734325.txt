txt WORKERS WERE on their hands and knees early this week , sclwping white ChicagoFest ' 79 stickers off the crosswalks where thousands of revelers had entered Navy Pier for 10 days of music , comedy , crafts , food , and more food . But inside the ChicagoFest offices , no one seemed to be thinking about the end of this year 's festival . They were too busy talking about next year . " I really feel about as high as I could about anything , " said Joe- Pecor , the energetic marketing director of Festivals , Inc. , the firm contracted by the city to run ChicagoFest . " You add 40. per cent attendance onto something I considered a success before . lIE ENDED HIS sentence with a wide grin , and with good reason . About 690,000 persons streamed into ChicagoFest this year , 200,000 more than last year . They spent enough money on tickets and concessions for the city to reap $507,684 more than its cost of $3,050,159 . Most of that money , according to Mayor Byrne , will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's festival . Some of it , however , will go to Festivals , Inc. , as a bonus for helping the city turn a profit . Moreover , Mrs. Byrne said she will ask the firm to submit proposals for autumn and winter festi- ' I vats . Meanwhile , Pecor , who spent most of the to days running around the pier with a walkie-talkie to his ear , and Tom DriBas , the big , jovial festival manager who amazed everyone by remaining calm amid times of chaos , are already enthusiastically planning next summer 's festival . PROPOSALS include expanding the ChicagoFest site to include city-owned land near Navy Pier , and lengthening of the festival to accommodate even more people . " It 'll keep getting bigger every year , " Drilias said . " It 's already bigger than the Newport Jazz Festival . It has more people and more acts . It is the biggest music festival in the country . " PECOR SAID the seating , and the number of performances may ' be increased for the Main Stage acts , which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year a country stage was added to the blues , rock , jazz , and folk stages .

" For the musicians , it 's a chance to perform before a whole new audience ? people who may come to hear jazz but end up at another stage listening to rock or country . " HE SAID the only type of Main Stage act missing this year was a folk singer , such as James Taylor , Joni Mitchell , or Joan Baez . He , said he is already working to book such an act for next year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , more summer entertainment is on the horizon . The first Chicago Jazz Festival , featuring a week of free evening concerts at the , Grant Park bandshell , begins Aug. 271 . Officials say facilities for handicapped persons will be upgraded at ChicagoFest ' 80 and that food offerings will be expanded to create more ethnic diversity . Some festival-goers this year complained there was no " soul food . " " BETWEEN TIIB ribs and the pizza , it was the first festival I 've worked at where I did n't lose weight , " said entertainment director Gast . Twice as much food . and drink as last year  --  including 11/2 million 12-ounce cups of beer  --  was sold , for a total of S3 million , Pecor said . At times lines for some popular food stands blocked traffic in the middle of the pier . " Thank God it 's over , " said Kevin Brown , a local restaurant manager who worked at one . stand . He was supervising the clean-up Monday morning at the nearly deserted pier . " It 's so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knocked over by the crowds . And there 's no smoke . " /* ? " IT 'S LIKE a nightmare that I 've finally woken from , " said Art Velasquez , an accountant for a rib vendor at the fest , as he drove away after cleaning up . But when asked if he wanted to come pack next year , he said , " Absolutely . ' ChicagoFest ' 79 was not without its problems . Winds blew down all five stages along the dock the week before , the festival began . On opening day , rain almost ruined an expensive musical console on the Main Stage . " IT TOOK a half-dozen people with hair dryers to get the thing dried out before the performance that.night , " said Lou Volpano , the 26-year-old production director , who had to make sure more than 100,000 watts of electrical power were available each day . He estimated that crews used 7,000 yards of plastic to wrap equipment during several rainstorms . " I do n't even want to think of how much tape we used , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had fun . Deputy Chief Carl Dobrich , who supervised the more than 250 policemen who patrolled the pier each day , said crowds were " extremely well-behaved . " " I could read it in their faces , " he said . " They were having a good time . " He termed the . 90 to 50 arrests per day " Insignificant " considering the size of the crowds . DESPITE THE excitement about next year 's festival , for which Drillas and Pecar have already been contracted to work , there was an air of melancholy on the pier this week , as winds blew empty cups across the concrete and workmen used cranes to tear down signs that had pointed the way to near non-stop ' enter ; tainment . " It 's a letdown , " said Jamie Gallagher , lighting . direclor for the dock stages , as he gathered up equipment on Monday morning from the now-quiet jazz , stage . " I was hoping to have a big party on the last night , but everyone was just too bushed . So we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And , " he said , " to next year . "
