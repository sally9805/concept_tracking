Roots : The Next Generations . ABC . In seven parts beginning Feb. 18 <P> The first time around , no one saw it coming . <P> When the first episode of Roots aired on Jan. 23 , 1977 , there were no signs that a phenomenon was in the making . Not only had ABC 'S mini-series been dismissed in advance by many TV critics , but it had already been rated as a long shot by the programmers and admen who run network television . Up to the last minute there were plenty of commercial spots for sale on Roots . ABC itself projected only a passable 28% to 31% share of the audience for the show ; CBS and NBC concurred , scheduling only routine fare against it . Not for the first time , Television Row 's conventional wisdom was completely wrong . <P> By the end of its seven-night run , Roots had piled up an average 66% audience share-some 130 million viewers - and become the most watched TV program ever . It also galvanized the country . Suddenly both the history of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emptied out during the show ; hundreds of colleges started Roots courses ; the National Archives in Washington found itself flooded by citizens ' requests for information about their ancestors . Writer Alex Haley , whose search for his African heritage had led to the book that led to Roots , became a folk hero . A TV smash hit became a cultural landmark . <P> Now , a scant two years later , ABC is attempting to make lightning strike twice - and now everyone is on the alert . When Roots : The Next Generations opens its seven-night run on Sunday , Feb. 18 , both audiences and the TV industry will be judging the offspring against its towering parent . Expectations are running high . Commercial time has been sold out for weeks , at $210,000 to $260,000 a minute ( compared with $120,000 to $150,000 for Roots 1 ) . The series has already been sold to 20 countries . CBS and NBC will not be caught napping again ; their fierce counterprogramming gambits have turned Roots 11 week into one of the most competitive ratings races @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failure would be a colossal embarrassment : budgeted at $16.6 million and running 14 hours , Roots 11 is nearly three times as costly as and two hours longer than the original . <P> On the quality of the show itself , ABC has nothing to worry about . In almost every way - acting , direction , dramatic and historical sophistication - the sequel is superior . Like Roots I , Roots : <P> The Next Generations is not art or , for that matter , definitive history , but it is a show-biz tour de force . An exceedingly clever and affecting soap opera , Roots II manages to play on the most basic sentimental feelings about democratic ideals and familial love . When , in the final hours , the tale turns to Alex Haley 's career , it also becomes an irresistible American success story . Taken as a whole , Roots 11 is a compendium of pop cul ture : it mixes elements of Gone With the Wind , Uncle Tom ' s Cabin , March of Time newsreels , Horatio Alger sto ries and even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lapses , but they are amusing rather than offensive . When Episode Six inexplicably dramatizes the young Haley 's first visit to a brothel , it is time to take a break and send out for pizza . This too is a legitimate part of the fun of any fully satisfying TV viewing experience .
