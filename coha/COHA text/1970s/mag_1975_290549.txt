According to conventional economic theory , when unemployment is high and factories are running at less than full tilt , prices are not supposed to shoot upward . Increasingly , however , they have-as indeed they are doing now . That anomaly poses a formidable challenge to economists , and it is the paradox to which John Kenneth Galbraith addresses himself in his latest book : Money : Whence It Came , Where It Went ( Houghton Mifflin , $10 ) . His conclusion : " Corporate and union power " is the heavy ; it " can defeat efforts to combine high employment with stable prices " regardless of the state of business , and can be curbed only by wage-price controls enacted and enforced not as a temporary expedient but as a permanent feature of the economy . <P> That is a theme Galbraith has argued many times before . Nonetheless , any new book by the retired Harvard professor and onetime ( 1961-63 ) Ambassador to India is an event-even if he is a compulsive overstater of his positions . Connoisseurs of civilized wit and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In recent books-notably Economics and the Public Purpose , published in 1973 , which argued for a " new socialism " - Galbraith has seemed tediously preachy . In Money he has recovered the gently acerbic touch that he displayed as a reformist capitalist , and that made popular such books as The Affluent Society and the New Industrial State . Sample putdown : " Those who talk of money and teach about it and make their living by it gain prestige , esteem and pecuniary return , as does a doctor or a witch doctor , from cultivating the belief that they are in privileged association with the occult ... Though professionally rewarding and personally , profitable , this too is a well-established form of fraud . " <P> Fool 's Choice . Galbraith sugarcoats his familiar plea for controls with an engaging and eminently readable economic history that speeds through no fewer than 27 centuries in 300 pages . From 700 B.C. to A.D. 1975 , says Galbraith , national leaders have wrestled ineptly with the problems of economic management-in recent years by trying to make " a fool 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choice is necessary , says Galbraith , with an obvious eye on the 1976 U.S. elections : Government could stimulate the economy as much as might be necessary , without causing inflation , if only the public knew enough about the wonders that wage-price controls can perform to elect an Administration that would dare to impose them . <P> Alternative remedies to the problem of inflation in an underemployed economy are brushed aside with a few strokes of the pen . Keynesian faith in fiscal ( tax-and-spending ) policy to end recessions and damp down inflations is questioned in a chapter titled " The New Economics at High Noon . " Galbraith argues that the reluctance of governments to raise taxes or cut spending during booms proves " the fatal inelasticity of the Keynesian system . " Monetary policy is dismissed as " a perverse and unpredictable lever " and Economist Milton Friedman 's carefully documented thesis that rapid expansion of a nation 's money supply contributes to inflation is rejected as " breathtakingly simple .
