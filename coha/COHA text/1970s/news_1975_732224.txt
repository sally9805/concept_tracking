txt Communist and Third World propaganda in the United Nations may soon erase the caricature of the United States in the role of a patronizing " Uncle Sugar " doling out the funds while absorbing the insults . The new American ambassador to the UN , Daniel Patrick Moynihan , has unabashedly staked his own dIplothatic and political future on loud and often eloquent rebuttals to what he regards as Third World insults agninst the U.S. and its allies . He did it when he arrived at the UN from his post as a professor at Harvard University , and he did it again the other day when he attacked a draft , resolution denouncing Zionism . If the resolution is adopted by the General Assembly , Moynihan remarked in what impressed some observers as a direct threat , " the support for the United Nations will have diminished . " QUITE OPENLY , American diplomats are asking delegates from other nations how much longer they think the U.S : will pay an outsized portion of UN costs while the organization persists in hounding America 's ally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The UN is likely through Its own self-destructiveness to lose whatever force it has , " said a senior American diplomat , disgusted with the overwhelming vote in favor of the draft resolution describing Zionism ? defined in the dictionary as " a movement formerly for reestablishing , now for advancing , the Jewish state 1 " Palestine " ? as a " form of racism and racial discrimination . " It would , the diplomat noted , " be an act of magic to convince many people that the money spent on the UN is that well-spent . " Well-spent or not , the U.S. in 1974 invested $168,879,903 in " assessed contributions " determined by the UN committee on contributions on a " capacity-toPAY " standard based on national income statistics . That figure , nearly 28 per cent of total " assessed contributions " of 8810,447,051 , Is more than double that of the next highest contributor , the Soviet Unienhassessed last year for $87,781,396 . THESE COMPARATIVE figures . however , hardly tell the story . More expensive than regular assessments are " vetuntarrcontributions " for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. paid 8245,918,727 111 1974 , nearly two and a half times the aspount given by second-ranking Sweden and more than 40 draw the figure of 85,102,915 provided by the Soviet Union . Diplomats point out that these figures are not quite fair in that Byelorussia and the Ukraine , both Soviet states , hold separate seats in the UN and make small " assessed " and " voluntary " contributions as well . In return , however , the Soviet Union in effect gains three votes in the General Assembly , an anomoly that dates from the founding of the UN in the interlude between World War II and the Cold War . " What 's more , more than half of the Soviet ' voluntary ' contributions are in the form of rubles paid to the United N a t ions Development Program , " a Western diplomat complained . " They are good only for purchases in the Soviet Union . " MOSCOW " FRANKLY Is not interested in the UN , " an economic expert has noted . " You have . to ask , ' Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' They are not really interested in participating in multilateral projects . They are interested only in advancing diplomatic and political purposes . " , The highly politicized approbch of the Soviet Union and other nations is manifest not only from the record of " voluntary " contributions but also from their refusal to pay off long-standing debts owed to UN operations which they regard as illegal . The Soviet Union , for instance , volunteers nothing to the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East despite its avowed sympathy with the plight of all Palestinians . The U. S. in 1974 donated some $39 million or 40 per cent of UNRWA 's budget  --  a manifestation of the American desire to lull Palestinian resentment against Israel . QUITE ASIDE from its position on " voluntary " contributions , the Soviet Union as of the beginning of 1975 had withheld some $111 million assessed for the Congo operation of the early 1960s , the UM Emergency Force in the Middle East . the UN Commission for Rehabilitation and Reunification of Korea , and technical assistance programs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ France , which " owes " $22 million for the Congo operation ; the eastern European nations ; and China , which also refuses to contribute to Middle East peacekeeping forces . " This refusal puts the financial services department of the UN in a constant crisis , " a diplomatic source said . " Each month it has a struggle finding enough money for the payroll . The comptroller of the UN , Helmut Debatin , calculates the resulting UN deficit at $90 million  --  and growing by 63.8 million a year . " In the midst of such mundane problem , the countries that seem to enjoy the UN forum the most are relatively unconcerned about how to pay for it . Statistics show that the 10 largest contributors pay 78 per cent of the " assessed " costs while the 70 poorest members of the organization en mama pay only 1.4 per cent of the budget . And many of them are a year or two behind in payments . They lose their proclaim General Assembly seats if they are more than two years ' delinquent . Tribum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assessed $563 , - 503 in 1974 while distinguishing itself among the most " revolutionary " members of the organization . Albania , echoing the viewpoint of China , paid $158,042 the same year . " Only a relatively small share of this money goes for the General Assembly and the committees where they make the speeches , " an American diplomat said . " A lot goes for things like the World Health Organisation the Food and Agricultural Organization , and so forth . And the UN still provides a meeting ground , an opportunity for people to coax . and say wbat they think . " " The world is in a transition period , " he pointed out . " It used to be West controlled the UN . Now these countries have different concerns . We ca n't control the organization any more ao we did in the 10s . We have to recognise where we stand . "
