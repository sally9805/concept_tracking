WHEN THE gorgeous blackbuck antelope popped out of the thicket Sandy Gilchrist 's heart leapt . It was love at first sight ; she knew she had to shoot it . No hunting she 'd done before had prepared her for this the glorious atavism of the Y.O . Ranch , the largest 125 square miles ) private hunting grounds in the United States . It was n't that Sandy disliked hunting . It was simply that it seemed so messy and unladylike . All that slogging around through the brambles , dodging rattlesnakes , sleeping overnight on the cold ground , running down an animal that someone else would probably beat you to anyway . But today , as Sandy rode around the Tnvpc Cash with har smut Duley and their hulking guide Raymond Rhodes , she decided this was something a person could get into . No longer was she just a dutiful wife keeping her husband company on his hill country safari 110 miles northwest of San Antonio . Now she wanted a trophy of her own , one that would make her children proud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " guaranteed hunting . " If she had only known Raymond 's pickup would make stalking game so civilized . If she had only known she could shoot in comfort without wrinkling her fine black slacks and Roger Rapoport is a free-lance writer based in California . He is the author of The Great American Bomb Machine and the coauthor 11 , Os. i ikrar , Rnrninn , attractive blouse , without messing up her neatly coiffed platinum hair or dirtying her brightly polished nails . It was enough to make a thirty-oneyear-old wife and mother into a serious big-game hunter . Sandy took another look at the two-tone antelope and recalled what Raymond had told her earlier that day : " In their native countries of Pakistan and India blackbuck are so rare and endangered they ca n't be hunted . But here at our ranch the $750 blackbucks are on sale for $500 as part of the Y.O . ' s Christmas Special . I 'd say you could n't find a better hunting bargain anywhere . " Now Sandy was ready to shoot . The only problem was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own GAMES SOME PEOPLE PLAY rifle and handed it to her . She slipped quietly out of the cab and propped the unfamiliar weapon across the truck hood . Sandy sighted the antelope through the scope and leveled him at 200 yards with her first shot . After this auspicious beginning Raymond spent the next two days chauffeuring the Gilchrists across the Y.O . ' s vast premises . His truck carved new roads out of the rocky hills and bushy draws covered with mesquite , live oak , and cedar . Sandy rode between Raymond and Duley , who alternately hunched down to let her fire through a window at shootable game . Mrs. Gilchrist did so well that by the end of their third day she had a hard time keeping all her accomplishments straight . When an inquisitive hunter at the Y.O . chuckwagon asked how she 'd made out , Sandy began counting on her fingers : " Well , let 's see , I 've got myself two hlackbuck antelope , a Corsican ram , a white fallow deer , a whitetail deer , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Duley lifted his balding head from the plate and opened a mouth full of half-chewed T-bone : " Hey , honey , ca n't you remember anything ? It was an axis , an axis deer . " Sandy blushed . Sandy 's take , along with two sika deer , a blackbuck , axis , and white . tail shot separately by Daley , brought the Gilchrists ' three-day total to eleven trophies . The hunt was well worth the $5,500 package price , the Gilchrists felt , especially because it spared them all the uncertainty and dirty work . Raymond was a perfect gentleman about field skinning all their animals , and he trucked each victim back to the smokehouse where an eager crew of Mexican ranch hands dressed the carcasses . Also , Duley did n't have to worry about driving home to Jackson , Mississippi , with any cumber. some animals roped to his car hood . The Y.O . workers taped the heads and shipped them to a taxidermisi for mounting . The meat from eight of the animals was sent to a nearby slaughterhouse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hamburger . These items were packed in dry ice and then airfreighted to the Gilchrists ' home freezer . Even after tipping Raymond with meat from three of his animals , Duley figured he still GAMES SOME PEOPLE PLAY had conic out ahead : " In Mississippi only one out of every five hunters even gets a shot at a deer . Only about one in twenty actually takes an animal home . Here you ca n't miss . For an investment man like myself who ca n't afford to take a two-week hunting vacation , that 's a real plus . " IT 'S ALSO A PLUS for the Senators , Congressmen , governors , astronauts , movie stars , Iranian royalty , and world-famous hunters who come to the Y.O . to stalk wild game from four continents . And the reasons they come explain many of the changing patterns in the business of killing big game . The primary reason is Y.O . ' s " no kill ? no pay " guarantee . Beyond a basic room-andhoard charge of $20 to $30 per day , the customers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason Y.O . ' s multimillionaire owner , Charles Schreiner III , can offerIuaranteed hunting with confidence is that killing game at his ranch is about as easy as shooting fish in a barrel ? perhaps even a little easier . Schreiner , a cherubic blondish man of forty-five , has devoted his life to building an ample supply of the world 's most prized big-game animals , nurtured , bred , and crossbred to perfection so that hunters can shoot them for their living rooms . Schreiner 's highest priced items are his 250 axis deer from India and two dozen specially bred Y.O . ibex that go for $1,000 apiece . Each of the 750 blackbuck and 200 North African aoudad sheep costs $750 . Hunters who want one of the 350 Japanese and Manchurian sika deer pay $500 . The 250 southern European fallow deer go for $400 to $500 , depending on their color . For $300 to $500 a hunter can take home one of 750 sheep from Corsica , Sardinia , or the West Indies . The 10,000 native whitetail deer are $250 each . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 native wild turkeys , round out the price list at $100 per kill . With more hunters crowding less hunting land each year , it is easy to understand the growing popularity of well-stocked ranches like the Y.O . Between 1965 and 1970 the number of hunters shooting on private preserves nearly doubled , from 225,000 to 433,000 , and most of them go to the Texas ranches where native deer and exotics abound . No one , however , has done a better job of perfecting hunting technology than Charlie Schreiner . His ranch is so big that most other private hunting preserves could fit inside one of its forty-nine pastures , and its picturesque longhorns and rolling terrain have backdropped numerous " Marlboro Country " cigarette ads . Charlie 's grandfather founded the Y.O . nearly a century ago as an ordinary cattle , sheep , and goat ranch , albeit one of the largest in central Texas . Schreiner originally began buying surplus exotics from zoos and raising his own herds as a hobby . But seventeen years ago he decided to turn his pets into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand dollars a year to kill his animals , almost as much as he earns from the humdrum livestock . The heaviest slaughter at the Y.O . occurs from mid-November to early January during the whitetail deer season , which is set by the state . The exotics , however , are Charlie 's personal property , so they can be hunted year round without a permit . Not to extinction , of course . Schreiner 's full-time staff of thirty includes a biologist who helps set annual kill quotas for each species . During 1972 the quota for all species came to about 500 . " We can come ridiculously close to the number of animals we want to shoot , " says ranch manager Robert Snow . Whenever there is a surplus of one variety , the Y.O . uses mass merchandising to halt the population explosion . Does , for example , which normally run $50 apiece , went on sale at three for $90 in 1971 . A FTER RISING at five o'clock each morning , the hunters drive a couple of hundred yards to the chuckwagon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their guests from morning to night , driving the hunters across the ranch by truck or open Jeep . No hunting is allowed on foot . To avoid accidents and prevent competition , only one party is assigned to a pasture at a time . Hunters can load and shoot only with the guide 's express consent . The Y.O . men are also expected to restrain guests from shooting most smaller animals ; whitetail bucks , for example , ca n't be taken unless they have at least eight points on their horns . Ranch publicist Hal Swiggett explains : " We 're selling trophy animals , so naturally quality control is important to us . We do n't let a man kill something unless we think he can hang it in his office with pride . After all , our name is on it too . " Another complication for the guides arises with hunters who come after specific trophies . Rudi Bollwein , a twenty-eight-year-old roofer from Queens , New York , flew to Texas this past December intent on taking a pair of Y.O . deer antlers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run by his hunting club back home . As Rudi explained to his guide Donnie Hilburn , " I 've got to have a ten-point to beat another guy in the club who already got an eight-point at a preserve in Canada . " For hours they circled the east and middle feed pastures in Donnie 's red pickup . Rudi , who had a red stocking cap pulled down over his blond hair , was frustrated : " You know , I 've looked at more bucks here in one day than I 've seen in eight years of hunting in New York State . But I 've got to find a ten-pointer . " Suddenly Rudi jumped out of his seat : " God , will you look at the spread on that thing . " He immediately began sighting through his rifle scope . Donnie brought his truck to a halt and took a long look through his binoculars : " Sorry , Rudi , it 's only a four-pointer . " That same month , guide Tiny Arbuckle was helping Sheila Link find herself a turkey over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four from Bradley Beach , New Jersey , had spent the early part of the morning inside a turkey blind just twenty-five yards away from a turkey feeder . Tiny was dumbfounded : " Ca n't understand it at all , Sheila . Hundreds of turkeys have been taken out of that blind . Why , a lot of people have even shot prize bucks that made the mistake of nibbling on the turkey feed . " Tiny , a Chattanooga gun-shop salesman who is big enough to play middle linebacker in the NFL , saves all his vacation time so he can guide at the Y.O . every December . Like the other guides , he makes $30 a day plus a $20 bonus for each exotic killed by one of his hunters . As he drove his open Jeep up and down the chilly pasture , Tiny kept turning to Sheila and saying : " This is ridiculous . We 've got to find you a turkey to go with that whitetail you took yesterday . " But despite a relentless search , Tiny was unable to find Sheila @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for lunch . Virtually all the other hunters at the chuck-wagon had kills to talk about , which was no surprise , since 98 percent of all Y.O . guests take a trophy . Jimmy Hartwell , Jr. , a young sportswear executive from Hartwell , Georgia , had taken two whitetails . Marvin Childress , a mustachioed General Foods man out of Houston , was well satisfied with his Corsican ram . Dallas bartender Randy Barton had nailed himself one of those sikas on the Y.O . Christmas Special . Even Rudi Bollwein had given up his hunting club trophy dream and settled for a " really nice pair of eight-point whitetail bucks . They 're too small to take first prize , but they 'll look good on the wall . " The only hunter who struck out completely was E. C. Brady , an eighty-four-year-old Dallas retiree who had failed to take the sika he was after . But his son , who runs a Dallas violin shop , more than compensated for this lapse by taking a whitetail and a sika . ? LTHOUGH SCHREINER IS always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never satisfied with the ranch . He continually introduces new animals , like zebras , sables , and peacocks . The Y.O . abounds with rare and endangered species , including hanteng cattle , damagazelle , scimitar-horned oryx , and barasingh deer . There are also four varieties of precious antelope ? addax , gemsbok , eland , and greater kudu . Many of these animals arc isolated in two nonhunting preserves , " Africana " and " Deer Park , " where sightseers can take guided tours for $5 . But other animals wander freely about the ranch , and guides must make sure their hunters do n't hit them . Mistakes are costly . During the past two years , hunters accidentally knocked off two of the Y.O . ' s prize Manchurian sika sires worth thousands of dollars apiece .. Schreiner tries to be philosophical about such mishaps . Several years ago a $10,000 bull eland arrived , charged off the trailer , fell and broke his neck . Schreiner 's response was to the point : " Hurry up and skin him , boys . Let 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Robert Snow has a similar altitude : - Periodically a neighbor will report one of our axis or sikas has escaped onto his property . Sometimes we 'll go pick up the animal and sometimes we 'll tell the neighbor to shoot the thing . It depends on how busy we are at the time . " Schreiner constantly inspects new species offered by zoos and other ranchers . Giraffes and elephants are currently under consideration . One effort to purchase three ostriches from a rancher fell through when the man tried to catch the birds with a I lasso and ended up strangling them . As one of the nation 's largest breeders of exotic creatures , Schrei0 ner sells many animals himself , even though they often bring in less money alive than his hunters pay for them 4 dead . Sometimes he gives exotics away to hill country neighbors , like the late Lyndon Johnson , who lived about sixty miles east of the Y.O . Schreiner and several of his Texas rancher friends have also been workii ing to head off the extinction of blackbuck antelope in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shipped small blackbuck herds back to these countries for repopulation . The Y.O . makes important charitable contributions to local causes as well . Every year , nearby service clubs round up 100 orphans and bring them out to shoot their first doe for free . The boys hunt Y.O . does early in the morning and then come in for a special church service . After the benediction , those orphans who missed killing a doe the first time around are given a second chance . Unfortunately . Schreiner was n't able : , to bring the orphans in this past Christmas . llis 1971 doe sale was too successful , and the ranch is cur , rently plagued by a shortage . Although children down to the age of four have hunted successfully at the Y.O. , some show signs of remorse . After one man shot a doe several years ago , his son cried out : " You killed Bambi . " Nonetheless , everyone on the ranch believes that hunting builds character in young people . Guide Raymond Rhodes , who used to be a deputy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great place for a boy to be . You do n't find kids that love to hunt out peddling dope . "
