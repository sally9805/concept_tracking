She was fond grandmother to the global village <P> A reporter turning up at one of her lectures at Manhattan 's American Museum of Natural History noted that the speaker somehow managed to discuss museums , stones , stuffed birds , cave paintings , Cro-Magnon man , children , parents , grandparents , dinosaurs , whales , the possibility of life in outer space , education , the youth revolution of the 1960s , the oneness of the human species , pollution , evolution , growing up in New Guinea , relations between the sexes , communes and the fragmentation of communities . <P> The list was typical . Margaret Mead was a small woman , but she got around . She spoke volubly and carried a forked stick . Her studies-and the two dozen books that resulted from them-revolutionized her chosen field of anthropology . Long before her colleagues recognized the validity of her approach , she studied the biological , psychological and sociological forces that shaped personality in primitive cultures , then used her findings to explain how individuals learn adult roles in modern societies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ willingness to speak out on almost any subject made her ideas-and her dumpy but ' somehow imposing figure topped by its . Buster Brown hairdo-famous around the world . By the time she died of cancer last week at the age of 76 , Margaret Mead had become the grandmother of the global village , an all-wise matriarch whose often provocatively put , common-sense opinions were sought by millions . Her colleagues feel that no single individual will be able to fill her shoes . Says Paul Bohannan , president of the American Anthropological Association : " Margaret Mead was , in fact , a centipede ; she had that many shoes . " <P> Both observation and involvement came naturally to Margaret Mead , who was born in 1901 in Philadelphia to parents who quite literally raised her to be a social scientist . She was only eight when she was assigned to observe and record her younger sisters ' speech patterns . Mead 's university training-she studied at New York 's Barnard College and Columbia University under such anthropology giants as Franz Boas and Ruth Benedict-only refined her talents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that launched her on a career that spanned more than half a century . In 1925 she sailed for Samoa with Boas ' blessing and $1,000 from her father , and spent nine months observing the adolescent girls of three small coastal villages in the Manua Islands . The result of her study was published three years later as Coming of Age in Samoa . <P> <P> The book , which described the easygoing , neurosis-free island way of life and suggested that the Western attitude toward sex could be relaxed without endorsing promiscuity , was an instant success . Many of the young researcher 's colleagues condemned her way of reaching conclusions from observed evidence , which Mead called " disciplined subjectivity , " and the quasi-novelistic style in which the book was written . But students snapped it up , partly because its ideas interested them , often because , as the author briskly explained , " I wrote it in English . "
