German workers have a well-earned reputation for zeal and discipline , but even they hate the time clock . Recognizing that , a growing number of employers , including the national airline Lufthansa , are giving some of their employees freedom to punch in , within broad limits , any time they choose in the morning and punch out when they please in the afternoon , as long as they continue to put in a required number of hours each month . <P> The system , called Gleitende Arbeitszeit ( staggered work time ) was begun four years ago by the aircraft and electronics firm of **26;630;TOOLONG , mostly because company bosses saw no other way of breaking the thick traffic tie-ups that developed when all employees tried to arrive at 7 a.m . Staggered hours have since been adopted by some 2,000 other firms , which find that the new freedom pares absenteeism by as much as 20% and actually increases productivity . <P> Work Credit . Messerschmitt 's system is fairly typical . Some 7,000 employees may punch in at any time between 7 a.m. and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They still must put in an average of 42 hours and work five days a week , but in any month they also have the option of working ten extra hours , building up a credit they can draw on for additional free time the next month , or putting in ten fewer hours and making them up the following month . <P> Erich Bolzer , a metalworker , says : " If I have enough hours on credit , I sometimes leave at noon , pack my family in my Ford , and visit the Munich shopping centers and bargain counters of the department stores . I figure that I save 15% to 20% in living costs this way . " Messerschmitt officials are equally pleased : they find that employees arrange things among themselves so that the flow of work is not hurt . <P> The way workers choose to exercise their freedom is an intriguing study in psychology . White-collar workers tend to punch in late and work late ; factory men usually come early and leave early . The experiment has attracted the attention of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Transport Ministry to arrive and leave within two-hour margins . The Bonn Cabinet will review results and decide whether to extend staggered working hours throughout the government . Unions are paying attention too . They are asking for a 2% raise for workers on staggered hours , arguing that it is justifiable repayment for lower absenteeism and higher productivity .
