If the announcement had been made almost anywhere else , it would probably have been dismissed as one more false alarm . But the word came from the Pasteur Institute in Paris , fons et origo of epochal research into man 's relationship with the microbes : Institute scientists had devised a vaccine to protect against the present generation of influenza virus and against generations yet unborn . The vaccine , said last week 's announcement , will be available almost immediately . <P> The flu virus is notorious for its frequent mutations . About every ten years , on the average , the transformation is so marked that the antibody system of a person who has been infected with the most recently prevalent strain , or vaccinated against it , does not recognize the new one . So he has no immunity . <P> In 1957 and 1968 , no one was immune to the radically different " Asian A2 " and Hong Kong strains that erupted in those years . The Pasteur scientists do not claim to have anticipated such a major mutation . But in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called " antigenic drift , " in which subtle changes occur in the virus ' protein overcoat . The now prevalent London flu strain represents one of several such minor changes in the basic Hong Kong virus of 1968 , and generally available vaccines are only 50% effective against it . <P> Forced Evolution . Until now , a vaccine to combat a newly evolved strain could be prepared only after the event ( TIME , Aug. 21 ) . Ideally , as Professor Claude Hannoun explained it , scientists would like to anticipate all the antigenic changes that nature might make in the next few years in the virus ' protein coat . But how to anticipate nature ? That would require capturing all the Hong Kong derivative strains now available , growing them in the laboratory and attacking them with different types of antibody . Most would be neutralized , but in this artificial equivalent of the Darwinian process of natural selection , a few mutant strains would survive because their protein coat patterns differ from those of earlier strains . If , as is almost certain , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be possible to make a vaccine which would protect against that antigen and therefore against all such strains . <P> Hannoun reported that by using a technique devised by Australian Immunologist Fazekas de Saint Groth , his research team had artificially caused such mutants to evolve . He was confident that they had anticipated all the minor changes that nature could produce in the next five years . Thus , he claims , they have produced a vaccine effective against all strains that may develop naturally from now until about 1978 . Samples prepared before the London flu strain emerged , he said , had proved 84% effective in tests on human subjects . <P> Raised Brows . To protect its patent rights , the self-supporting Pasteur Institute has not yet documented its find in scientific publications . Partly for that reason , some scientists still kept their eyebrows raised . How , they asked , could anyone be certain that he had anticipated all the mutants that resourceful nature might produce ? It may take five years , they concluded , to prove the institute 's claim that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
