THAT annual rite of fall-the struggle over who should represent China in the United Nations-used to be fairly predictable . In past sessions , the drama has swirled around the so-called Albanian resolution , which offers the U.N . ' s 127 members a simple choice : Taipei or Peking . This year , with the U.S. not only dropping its opposition to Peking 's entry but working for the seating of both governments , the delegates will be able to vote for one or the other - or for both . <P> This opens the way to an almost infinite number of tactical possibilities . " With good staff work , we might come up with 5,000 scenarios and miss what actually happens , " said one U.S. expert . Nonetheless , seasoned U.N . watchers are concentrating on two possible scenarios , depending on how energetic the U.S. is in its effort to preserve Taipei 's seat : <P> <P> HOW TAIPEI MIGHT GET THROWN OUT . If the pro-Peking forces feel strong or judge that Taipei 's support is in disarray , Albania might call for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring it to a vote in late September or early October . The Albanian resolution provides for the seating of Peking both in the General Assembly and in the Security Council , as well as the outright expulsion of Taipei . <P> The key element of all this maneuvering is the General Assembly rule that questions designated " important " require a two-thirds vote , while other questions including " procedural " matters can be settled by a simple majority vote . The question of whether an issue is to be treated as important is settled by a majority vote . <P> In the past the U.S. has always managed to block the Albanian resolution by rounding up a simple majority on a procedural motion declaring the matter important . But having counted heads last year , the U.S. has concluded that it can no longer depend on enough support for this . In short , the Albanian resolution will no longer be important . In the absence of any other parliamentary maneuver , it is thus possible that a simple majority might vote for the Albanian resolution as it stands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> HOW TAIPEI MIGHT HANG ON . To prevent Taipei 's expulsion , the U.S. could resort to another parliamentary maneuver ; it could make a procedural move calling for separate treatment of the Albanian resolution 's two parts , splitting the section that requires the seating of Peking from the section that requires the expulsion of Taipei . The logic behind such a move is simple : a majority of the General Assembly wants to seat Peking , but does not necessarily want to see Taipei thrown out . <P> In this stratagem , admission of Peking would presumably be carried by a simple majority . Then , if the U.S. had its way , expulsion of Taipei would be defined as an important matter requiring a two-thirds vote , which the advocates of Taipei 's ouster might fail to muster . <P> Taking another tack , the U.S. could introduce a separate procedural resolution declaring that Taipei is a U.N . member in good standing-despite uncertainties about what it represents-and thus could not , under the U.N . charter , be ousted without a two-thirds vote . If either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peking probably would , as it has promised , refuse to take its newly won seat .
