U.S. businessmen eager to invest in Japan 's dazzling economy have long complained that Japan , Inc. is a very closely held corporation . For example , individual foreigners are forbidden to own more than 10% of the stock in any Japanese company , and firms in no fewer than 704 separate industries , including everything from automobile manufacture to fruit-juice production can not be more than 50% owned by non-Japanese . Last week the Foreign Investment Council , a key board of private businessmen and economists that advises the government , recommended cracking open this protectionist wall . The Tokyo government is expected to approve , and shortly after , with a few notable exceptions , foreign investors should be able to own as big a share of Japanese business as they wish . <P> Consent . The proposed new rules would allow foreign investors starting new businesses in Japan to provide all the capital for them except in 22 industries . Of these , five that are considered especially vital to the Japanese economy-including munitions , leather and large-scale retailing-would be kept permanently off-limits to majority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothing , computer , pharmaceutical and camera-film manufacturing , would be opened to 100% outside ownership within the next three years-though some investments would still be subject to government review . The council also urged that investors be free to buy as much stock as they wish in existing Japanese firms , except for those in the five strategic industries - " provided that the prior consent of the company involved is obtained . " That stipulation seems designed to protect Japanese managements from being dumped if their firms are bought out by foreigners . <P> Just how much U.S. investment might be attracted by the new rules is problematical . Full-ownership opportunities will be delayed in some of the industries that Americans are most eager to enter . For example , American film manufacturers will not be able to run wholly owned subsidiaries in Japan until 1976 . The permanent ban on big retail chains that are not half-owned by Japanese was a sharp disappointment to U.S. businessmen , who have long grumbled that Japanese retailers deliberately fail to promote American goods . <P> Ironically , if the new rules @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will temporarily worsen the enormous American balance of payments deficit with Japan . Profits from the investments , however , eventually would shrink the deficit again . In any case , the liberalization is welcome , and should help soothe the often acrimonious relations between the two mightiest economies in the non-Communist world . It will constitute a long-overdue recognition of reality : Japan 's economy has grown far too powerful either to need or deserve protection .
