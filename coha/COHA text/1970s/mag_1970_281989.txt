The bitter Protestant-Catholic rioting in Northern Ireland last August aroused predictable sympathy in the largely Catholic Irish Republic to the south . Last week there were charges that extremists in Eire have been providing far more palpable support . In a whirl of charges and countercharges , Prime Minister Jack Lynch fired two of his Cabinet ministers . A third resigned in sympathy . At week 's end Lynch reshuffled his entire Cabinet . Behind the firings was the story , not yet fully substantiated , of an arms plot intended to strengthen the outnumbered Catholics of the North . <P> Though Lynch appeared convinced that the two ousted ministers were linked directly to the rumored plot , both men - former Agriculture Minister Neil Blaney and ex-Finance Minister Charles Haughey-flatly denied any involvement . In any event , disclosure of the gunrunning story heightened Protestant fears of a Catholic plot to take over Ulster and strengthened the hand of such right-wingers as the Rev. Ian Paisley . To appalled moderates on both sides of the Irish border , this seemed to promise renewed religious strife in the North @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
