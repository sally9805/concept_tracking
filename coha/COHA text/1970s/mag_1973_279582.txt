As they have for the past several years , officials of Pan American World Airways are looking forward to March 31 with all the anticipation of a prisoner facing execution . By that date a group of the nation 's most powerful bankers must decide whether to renew the financially troubled air carrier 's $300 million line of credit , without which Pan Am would be forced into a drastic reorganization . Pan Ann 's top executives , as well as quite a few other airline experts , seem convinced that the nation 's No. 1 overseas carrier will finally , after four years of disastrous losses , engineer a profit turn-around in 1973 . <P> Yet the ride between now and two weeks past the Ides of March is still likely to be a bumpy one . <P> Last week Pan Am announced that its losses in 1972 , through November , totaled $24 million . That was about $4,000,000 less than in the same period a year earlier , * but was nonetheless a dismal showing for a year in which most airlines made money . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Pan Am would break even in 1972 , now estimate that the line will close its books later this month with as much as $30 million worth of red ink for all 1972 . A Pan Am officer privately concedes that the final figures will look " terrible . " <P> To make matters worse , the company is apparently having trouble raising new cash . It is in the process of floating $75 million worth of convertible debentures-in effect , loans from private investors that will be paid off in Pan Am stock after three years . Normally , such issues list a fixed price at which the bonds can eventually be exchanged for stock , leaving the investor to decide whether the market price of the stock is likely to rise enough in the interim to make buying the bonds now an interesting speculation . By contrast , Pan Am has written into its debentures an unusual promise that the bonds can be exchanged for stock in 1976 at a price substantially-probably 20%-below whatever the market price of Pan Am shares then happens to be . Presumably , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this distress-sale clause because investors , who have seen the value of Pan Am shares drop 33% since September , could not be tempted into buying the debentures without some protection against further declines in the price of the stock for which the bonds will be exchanged . Last week the stock closed at 87/8 . <P> New Era . Yet for all its money problems , Pan Am has lately taken some major strides to get itself in better shape . Since taking over as chairman last March , former Air Force General William T. Seawell has hacked away at employee deadwood , firing altogether 1,500 workers , including quite a few executives . He has also successfully cut back expenses . For example , Pan Am now operates its fleet of jumbo Boeing 747 aircraft for $1,692 per hour each , compared with $1,762 for rival TWA , which in the past has usually come out ahead on efficiency . Says a Pan Am official : " In the long course of being in transition , I guess we 're finally transiting. "       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
