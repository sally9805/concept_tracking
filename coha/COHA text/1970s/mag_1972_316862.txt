Dr. Max Jacobson accompanied President John F. Kennedy to his 1961 summit meeting with Nikita Khrushchev in Vienna , visited Kennedy at the White House and was often heard to boast that he treated both the Chief Executive and his wife . Last week the New York Times reported that the German-born G.P. could have done a good deal more name-dropping from his roster of rich and famous patients . The Times also suggested that those patients were getting some startling treatments . Dr. Jacobson , said the Times , had been dispensing amphetamines , the powerful stimulants known to the drug culture as " speed . " He had given injections to dozens of the country 's leading writers , politicians and jet-setters to elevate their moods and help them to perform better . <P> The story takes pains to point out that there is no proof that either President or Mrs. Kennedy received amphetamines from Jacobson . Nor does it say which of those on Jacobson 's patient list-which included such names as Author Truman Capote , Playwright Tennessee Williams , Singer Eddie Fisher and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But the story does establish that amphetamines were often a part of Jacobson 's prescriptions . <P> Many of Jacobson 's patients regard him as a virtual magician whose treatments have been essential to their careers . Others have found the price of performance too high . Amphetamine users often become heavily dependent on the drug , which can produce the symptoms of schizophrenia . Many amphetamine users experience delusions and feelings of paranoia ; some become depressed and suicidal . <P> Several of Jacobson 's patients suffered bad effects from their treatment . Film Producer Otto Preminger , a patient for a short time , quit because the shots made him feel " terrible . " Said he : " It was one of the most fearful experiences of my life and I 'd never go again . " Tennessee Williams ' brother says that the playwright spent three months in a mental hospital after Jacobson 's treatments . Another patient , Photographer Mark Shaw , died of an overdose of amphetamines . <P> Stories of drug-dispensing " Dr. Feelgoods " have been part of medical folklore for some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been so startling as the Times 's disclosure . At least a dozen of the paper 's reporters and researchers worked on the project during the last five months . Jacobson lost little time in defending himself and blasting what he termed " inaccuracies and distortions . " He did not deny that at least some of his patients received amphetamines . Said he : " I have satisfied myself that in small amounts and under close supervision amphetamine can be a valuable tool in a doctor 's hand . " The dosages , he maintained , were " a good deal lower than those prescribed in the so-called weight-reduction pills . "
