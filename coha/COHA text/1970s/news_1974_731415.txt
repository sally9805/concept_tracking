txt Israeli anxiety about the future persists , following President Nixon 's return to Washington from his Middle East trip . Although the three-week-old government of Prime Minister Yitshak Rabin survived a vote of no confidence Wednesday in the Knesset ( Parliament ) , by 60 votes to 50 , Israelis are asking a lot of grave questions . The immediate issue before the Knesset was whether the government had made overly cal- ? ming statements concerning the U.S. promise to supply nuclear fuel to Egypt . The U.S. made a Bimilar promise of nuclear aid to Israel , but the agreement with Egypt is considered a more significant breakthrough , as well as being unexpected by many Israeli officials . Points of concern Although the nuclear aid issue is at the center of their apprehensions , Israelis are uneasy about other questions as well . Some of these are : Will American policy shifts , which have emerged from Mr. Nixon 's Mideast tour , drastically change the relation of forces between Israel and its onetime enemies ? Will promised American assistance unwittingly enable the Arabs to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ namely , the liquidation of Israel ? // *Israel uneasy over pacts // Will the new Nixon-Kissinger Middle East progress eventually emerge as America 's greatest blunder ? Or as a turning point leading to the pacification of this region , the end of Russian trouble-making in the Mideast and to the securing of undisturbed oil supplies ? to the Western world ? Many an Israeli agrees with former Defense Minister General Moshe Dayan , who said that the Nixon tour " will prove a fatal mistake - in the history of the Middle East " if the Egyptians abuse it for manufacturing atomic weapons . Comment reserved But Prime Minister Rabin has withheld specific comment , pending the expert opinion he requested from two Israeli nuclear scientists . In his effort not to alienate the United States , Mr. Rabin appears to favor a less argumentative and more adaptable style than previous Israeli administrations . In his speech to the Knesset Wednesday , Mr. Rabin said it was possible for Israel to make use of U.S. rapprochement with the Arabs . " . . . Israel has no reason to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . Outlining his political credo on Monday , Mr. Rabin said : " We have to explore all avenues that could possibly advance us towards pacification and peace . So that , if , God forbid , we have to fight a new war , we should at least know that we tried everything and were left with no other choice . " The new Prime Minister 's statements so far indicate that he sees the United States in a threefold role here : 1 . Helping Israel in maintaining its military and economic viability , 2 . Pacing the way towards a settlement between Israel and the Arab states , and 3 . Deterring the Soviet Union from further harmful activities in this region . Affreement shapes up As to the first role , considerable agreement appeared to have been reached between the President and the Prime Minister .

" Mr. Peres , it is recalled here , became known as a principal architect of Israel 's own atomic research program under the defense ministershipof the late David ben Gurion . Whether Israel possesses atomic weapons is the best guarded secret of state here . It is no secret , however , that Israel does have the technological capability to manufacture atomic arms without outside assistance . Two reactors operating Israel has two nuclear reactors ? one near the desert city of Dimona and one on the Mediterranean coast near Nahal Sorek , south of Tel Aviv . Up till now Israel has refused to join the international convention against atomic proliferation or to undertake not to produce atomic weapons . What particularly alarms the Israelis now is a statement by the Egyptian Foreign Minister Ismail Fahmy that Egypt would not ratify the international nonproliferation treaty unless Israel joined it too . He added that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bomb . "
