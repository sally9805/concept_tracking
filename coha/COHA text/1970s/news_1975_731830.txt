txt Letters to the Editor Letters to the Editor Health-Fund Cutbacks : Ford vs , the Poor To the Editor : If President Ford has his way , a serious crime is soon to be perpetrated upon a large segment of the American people  --  the - poor , and the working poor in particular . I refer to Mr. Ford 's proposed cutbacks in Federal funding of health programs for fiscal 1976 and beyond . The working poor , whose income level disqualifies them from public assistance but is too low to enable them to afford private medical care ( they are usually categorized as " medically indigent " ) , would bear the brunt of these reductions . Congressional approval of these unconscionable cutbacks can only accelerate the outrageous decline in human services initiated by cuts during the later Nixon years . The Office of Management and Budget'is about to present to Congress a budget that is more than $175 million short of current funding levels for many health-care areas , including $50 million in neighborhood health center funding ( representing a closure of 68 of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patients ) . These centers provide accessible , preventive , comprehensive , family-oriented care , including medical , dental , social , nutritional , mental-health , community outreach and home services . In addition , they provide employment for thousands of inner-city and rural-community residents . Furthermore , the Nicholas Borman Colby 's Understatement To the Editor : In your March 6 news story regarding the opening of Bella Abzug 's mail by the C.I.A. , you report that William E. Colby conceded at one point during the hearing that " some of the material which was collected by the C.I.A . over the last 27 years may not be appropriate today .. .. " I would say that all of the material collected would not be appropriate since the founding of the Republic . CAROLINE GILMAN Laurelton , N. Y. , March 6 , 1975 ? To the Editor : Mr. Colby of the C.I.A . has stated that the agency will make available to American citizens the nonsensitive portions of its files . The individual must , however , request this from the agency . Since none of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I suggest that all 200-plus million citizens Submit requests for their files . An alternative is for the C.I.A . to inform the individuals  --  involved that files have been kept on them . The broader issues , of course , concern the right of the C.I.A . to maintain such files and its ability to and interest in defining " sensitive " and " nonsensitive " material . MARK OROMANER Jersey City , March 6 , 1975 Offshore Oil Facts To the Editor : Your Feb. 17 editorial " Oil From the Shelf " reflects your continued preference for procrastination in all things relating to oil and the industry 's efforts to increase U.S. petroleum supplies . Four years ago ( Jan. 26 , 1971 ) you brushed aside the 37-volume environmental-impact statement on the Alaskan pipeline by saying that " this should not pave the way for an immediate approval of the pipeline . " On Sept. 30 , 1971 , you stated that no one is claiming that Alaska oil is vital " to this country 's welfare this year , next year or even the next decade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the economic impact of the Arab oil embargo would have been far less . Now your obsession with obstruction has shifted to the Outer Continental Shelf . You say : " The offshore program has no bearing on the immediate economic crisis and ... scarcely rates a priority that would justify headlong action . " Elsewhere you state that oil from the Atlantic would not begin to flow until at least six years from now , and that it would account for no more than 8 per cent of the nation 's daily consumption ( or about proposal contains cuts of $60 million in maternal and child health funding , $21 million in family planning funding , $39 million in community mentalhealth funding , $5 million in migrant health funding plus millions more in programs such as rodent control and lead-poisoning control . These are relatively paltry sums when one views the total scope of governmental funding patterns : for example , the $1.5 billion for over 200 super-bombers at $75 million apiece . We are speaking merely about survival-level funding for services , which , if removed , will leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ services in the face of voluntaryhospital curtailments and municipalhospital overutilization . We are talking about life and death . What does this mean ? The message seems abundantly clear that in these economically difficult times this Administration has declared the poor , working poor and all medically indigent to be inflationary and therefore not deserving of vital services . It is also abundantly clear that this is part of a master plan for the ultimate destruction of neizghborhood health centers and other ' socially productive health programs . This must not be allowed to happen . ZACHARY FINKELBERG , M.D. Medical Director Neighborhood Health Services Program New York , March 5 , 1975 Of Arms and Energy To the Editor : The hidden dimension in American arms sales abroad is the amount of energy it costs us . Huge amounts of fuel are consumed at home in smelting the metal , fabricating the parts and performing all the other operations required to manufacture a gun or an airplane . The $8.3 billion in U.S. arms sales to foreign governments in fiscal 1974 translates very roughly into an energy expenditure of 400 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barrels of crude oil , or Con Edison 's total energy consumption in a year , or all the energy used by all the motor vehicles in the state of California in three months . So when we sell arms to the Arabs , for instance , we are sending back a substantial portion of the energy we bought from them . MICHAEL GERRARD New York , Feb. 25 , 1975 ? How About Knife Control ? ' To the Editor : The knives tempt and glitter , along with other trashy merchandise , ? in store windows on 42d Street and on Broadway . One of . these knives may have been used in the subway murder of the Manhattan College student . Judging from almost daily news stories , knives are a major murder and robbery weapon . Colorful and with a sinister elegance , these noveltystore knives can seemingly be bought in a few minutes by anyone . Of what use are they except as criminal weapons ? With attempts at gun control , how about knife control ? As a start , how about a Sullivan Law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of novelty knives in souvenir and gadget stores in the Times Square area and elsewhere ? Stabbing homicides may take a sharp drop if these steps are taken . JOSEPH DEITCH New York , Feb. 26 , 1975 one and a half million barrels a day ) . Your readers may be interested in some facts ignored by your editorial : First , the Atlantic offshore area may contain , in addition to billions of barrels of crude oil , as much as 110 trillion cubic feet of natural gas . While the natural-gas potential can obviously not help the " immediate economic crisis , " it can both lessen the chances of layoffs in East Coast factories and create new jobs in the years ahead . Second , the six-year lead time your editorial mentioned corresponds exactly to the length of the moratorium on further drilling in the Santa Barbara area . The years of delay there only added to the problems caused by the Arab oil embargo . Third , the daily volume of oil that you mentioned may be found in the Atlantic is almost equivalent to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arab embargo . That amount may be " modest , " but it was enough to bring about long lines at service stations last year . It 's time for positive actions to solve those problems . Specifically , it 's time to begin to get Atlantic seabed oil and natural gas off the shelf . FRANK N. IKARD President , American Petroleum Inst . Washington , Feb. 27 , 1975 Overpopulation Fallacies To the Editor : Ambassador John Scali , in an address Feb. 20 . to the United Nations Population Commission , blamed rapid population growth for starvation both present and prospective , for slow eco ; nomic development in the Third World , for eventual threats to world peace , ' for ecological spoliation , for the subjugation of women and for the plight of children . - Common sense warns us against a theory that traces so many ancient ills to so single and modern a phenom : enon . So do facts . Since World War II the world 's food . production has been outstripping pop , ulation . Despite setbacks , the ability Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there for all to , see , on page 404 of " The Determinants and Consequences of Population . ? Trends . " That same United Nations publication controverts Ambassador Scali 's assertion that rapid population growth impedes economic growth . On . page 515 it cites Nobel laureate Simon . - Kuznets ' opinion that in less-developed , countries , population and per capita income grow apace . Most Third World nations boasting high per capita economic growth also enjoy demographic growth of , between 2.5 and 3.5 percent , above average among their peers , - Of the United States , Ambassador . Scali observed : " We are continuing to expand our own national family plan-. ? ping service programs , and our country 's fertility rates continue to decline . - We have , in fact , been below the replacement level of fertility for three years now . " Quite so , and our unwillingness toreproduce ourselves is already display- - ing its antisocial effects . Beneath our top-heavy population pyramid our Social Security system lies agonizing . Because Social Security is essentially the transfer of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , its principles are not actu -- arial but demographic . Today every Social Security beneficiary is support= ed by ? only three working persons , ? whereas 25 years ago sixteen working persons supported each beneficiary . Worse is to come , thanks to our ' continued decline in fertility . Within three decades there will be 2.3 working persons to support each retired ? person . Social Security 's only realistic hope lies in raising productivity , ? an uphill struggle while population declines . This is the melancholy path the United States is marching down resolutely and blindly , beckoning others to follow . Must we proceed ? - PATRICK RILEY Washington , March 2 , 1975 The writer is foreign editor , National . Catholic News Service . ? The Sneak Inflators To the Editor : It should be noted that some of the large corporations , for reasons of . their own , are working to make in- , flation less painful to the consumer .. Apparently believing that what one . does n't know will not hurt one , they camouflage increased costs so that'the , full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cost of a pack- ? age of " Beverage Napkins " produced by Hallmark has increased from fifty to sixty cents . Considering that the price had been held at fifty cents for ' a long , long time , a 20 per cent in. ? crease seems fairly reasonable . How ? many ' buyers will notice that the . ' number of napkins per package hag been reduced from twenty to fifteen and that what appeared at first glance to be a 20 per cent increase actually is a price hike of 60 per cent ? Various products have been repackaged in recent years , and there are ' many instances where a reduction in ? content has been substituted for an increase in the price of the package . I wonder if this sort of price increase is always taken into account in the Cost of Living Index . JOHN H. PETERSON Ridgewood , N. J. , March 6 , 1975 ? Of Jane Fonda 's Standards To the Editor : In your Feb. 26 issue Jane Fonda is - quoted as saying that " the major police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She apparently , also regards as " ironical " the questions asked her by American come-. spondents regarding her views on civi1 liberties in the Soviet Union . It seems to us that Miss Fonda is here applying a double standard . She criticizes Senator Henry M. Jackson for not speaking out against Lon Nol or General Thieu but herself evades direct answers to questions relating . to the dissidents of the Soviet Union , , many of whom are barely alive in the appalling conditions of prison camps . and mental hospitals for no worse a reason than having spoken out in de- . Tense of human rights or , in other cases , attempting to emigrate . Luckily , - Miss Fonda can make political statements in her own country with no such repercussions . Surely , human compassion should - apply equally to all victims of political oppression . Any other attitude can only be regarded as hypocrisy .
