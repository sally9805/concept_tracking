During his four years as U.S. Ambassador to Jamaica , Millionaire Businessman Vincent de Roulet did not exactly keep a low diplomatic profile . He kept his 90-ft. luxury yacht Patrina docked in sunny Kingston harbor . He had 17 race horses and ran them at the local Cayman track . In his gray Checker limousine lay a cushion with the inscription : " This is my car and I sit where I please . " <P> A Nixon appointee who contributed $29,000 to Republicans last year , De Roulet , 47 , was no stickler for diplomatic decorum . He liked to vent his conservative views in pithy asides , and several times was overheard referring to islanders as niggers . " He loved dogs more than humans , " a Jamaican official said , recalling that for the return of one of his lost pets ( a mongrel dog ) the ambassador once offered $500 , which is more than many Jamaicans earn in a year . De Roulet rattled Jamaicans even more by telling a Rotary Club lunch gathering that the visa section of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in flooding our toilets .

In exchange for a personal guarantee that Manley would not nationalize the U.S.-owned bauxite industry , De Roulet said , he had promised not to intervene in the elections . Manley promptly denied the tale , pointing out that at no time during his campaign had he threatened to nationalize foreign companies . Then he declared De Roulet persona non grata-the first time any U.S. diplomat has been so chastised in Jamaica 's ten-year independent history . An editorial titled " No Tears " in the Jamaican Daily News pointedly commented : " What the public needs to know is why the ambassador was allowed to remain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
