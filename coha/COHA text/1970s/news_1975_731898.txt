txt Soundings among financial policymakers on Capitol Hill reveal , even among the President 's fellow Republicans , much doubt about toeing the budget deficit line drawn by President Ford . " It 's going to be darn tough , " concedes Robert Boyd , staff director of the Republican minority on the Senate Budget Committee , which is preparing this week to set an overall federal spending target . Current outlook on the red-ink front : ? Cuts in the budget areas least desired by Mr. Ford ? national defense and foreign aid . The Democratic majorities on the Budget and Appropriations ( spending ) Committees are known to favor trimming military outlays , in particular , even though the President has specifically exempted " long-range national security interests " from his no-more-spending ultimatum. // *Congress to defy Ford // ? Rejection of some expensive economic recovery proposals , but only scaling-down ? at most ? of others . " Some will not be adopted , and some will be adopted but pared back , " predicts Sen. Walter F. Mondale ( D ) of Minnesota , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Refusal to cut " social " spending for such programs as housing , health , education , and welfare . Congress strongly hinted its spending priorities when Mr. Ford recently asked the rescinding of $2.2 billion already appropriated . Lawmakers trimmed just 12 percent of it ? mostly from defense funds , including money for a dozen swing-wing , F-111 fighter-bombers , but not a penny for " social " outlays . Congressional doubts about the President 's $60 billion deficit ceiling , say Capitol Hill sources , are both economic and political . " We do n't want to foul up the rate of recovery by overspending now , " says the Senate Budget Committee 's Republican staff director , but the recessed economy requires " some stimulative work . " On the political side , he notes that even Republicans must examine each to-spend-ornot-to-spend issue " in light of the political realities . " Sen. Dale Bumpers ( D ) of Arkansas doubts that Congress , despite genuine concern about the deficit , can resist continued heavy spending . Asked at a breakfast meeting with reporters April 9 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vote otherwise , he replied , " Yes . " Mr. Ford also may get little immediate help from Congress 's new process of budgetary self-discipline . Starting with the next fiscal year in July , lawmakers will begin to rein their helter-skelter fiscal habits within specific spending and deficit guidelines . " But whether it will have any effect on spending and priorities , " cautions a member of the Republican staff of the House Appropriations Committee , " remains to be seen . " He reflects the reservations of many on Capitol Hill that the new budget controls set only " targets , " not " ceilings " on spending , and fail to regulate the massive " backdoor " or automatic spending which falls outside congressional appropriations ( such as social-security payments and general revenue sharing ) . The President 's recent proposal that Congress legislatively crank up its new budgetary machinery one year early , skipping the trial run originally scheduled for the coming fiscal year , overlooked the fact that both budget committees already are doing so . " It 's done ? there 's no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aide , faulting the White House for " bad staff work . "
