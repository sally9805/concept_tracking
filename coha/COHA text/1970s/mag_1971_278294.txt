Prisoners often write merely to keep themselves sane . Perhaps it was the same impulse that caused Les Brown to produce a book . After 17 years on the beat , the television editor of Variety set out to chronicle a full year of TV not only from in front of the set , but from behind it , at the corner offices of the networks . He did so in 1970 , which , to be sure , was not an average year . It was a period of attacks by Vice President Agnew , of diminishing revenue from cigarette advertising , of unusual audience volatility . The result of Brown 's endeavors is the sanest-and the saddest-book ever written about television . <P> Brown calls it Televi$1on : The Business Behind the Box ( Harcourt Brace Jovanovich ; $8.95 ) . The $ in the title is no misprint . The pursuit of the buck is no more dishonorable in television than elsewhere , but the pursuers constitute the most unabashed lot of yahoos , bunko shooters , numbers racketeers and overstuffed shirts that has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's cast is frighteningly real . <P> &gt;Here is Robert D. Wood , president of CBS , booming one of his famous malapropisms : " Just screened the pilot for one of our new shows ! Boy have we got something-a real potboiler ! " <P> &gt;Here is Cartoonist Joe Barbera displaying a large illustration of a beagle and a cat , central characters in a pilot cartoon about middle-class family life as seen through the eyes of their pets . " Ca n't sell it , " complains the illustrator . The networks say it 's too gentle . They want hard action . " <P> " You mean violence ? " asks Brown . <P> " We try not to use the word . " <P> &gt;Here is Mike Dann , when he was senior vice president of CBS , asking his underlings for suggestions to keep the network No. 1 . Their contributions : " Use soap-opera aspects of Peyton Place in all our daytime promos . " " We should get Dick Van Dyke to host Born Free . " " Ice shows are doing well . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <P> &gt;Here are Leonard Goldenson and Simon B. Siegel , top officers of ABC , firing a brilliant , outspoken executive " because he was not bland enough for television . " <P> Moral Chill . Brown 's book is considerably more than a rich thesaurus of anecdote . A sardonic muckraker , Brown demonstrates why commercial broadcasting , now a half-century old , remains " Babbitt at 50 . " The moral chill of the McCarthy era still afflicts the networks . Even in their journalism there is an ever-present binary fear of Government and advertisers . Thus TV-documentary writers begin a special on corruption in Saigon-only to have it scuttled . Then they are assigned a program on patent medicines-and ordered to abandon it . Then they start work on an examination of the military-industrial complex ; that , too , is killed .
