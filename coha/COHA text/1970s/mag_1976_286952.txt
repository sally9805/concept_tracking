MURDER BY DEATH <P> Directed by ROBERT MOORE Screenplay by NEIL SIMON <P> Take a shot at this : try talking about a Neil Simon piece-play or movie or TV sketch-without retelling one of his gags . It is no secret that Simon 's writing depends mostly on jokes , the kind of good delicatessen dialogue comedy writers toss off during a fast lunch . Niceties like plot and characterization are provided largely to make the jokes work . Simon 's characters have quirks in place of personalities , and they tend to talk alike , because the jokes have little to do with the people who say them . Sometimes Simon conveys the uneasy feeling that dialogue from The Odd Couple could have been transposed from Plaza Suite , and that any one of the population of Murder by Death , convivial as they may be , could be set down , unruffled , in the middle of California Suite ( TIME , June 21 ) . <P> Easy Laughter . This may explain the feeling that Simon is working the audience over even as he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Death , which is casually funny and lovingly acted , one feels manipulated by a master . The laughter comes easy but it is always without challenge or surprise . Simon has all the blessings of supreme craftsmanship and most of the limitations as well . After a bit , even his skill starts to get in his way , as if one had called up <P> Dial-a-Joke and got an LP recording . <P> Murder by Death , a broad send-up of Agatha Christie 's Ten Little Indians , is fair enough fun . Simon 's jokes , if pre dictable , are also reliable , and Director Robert Moore has recruited some splendid actors to make them work . It is Simon 's notion that Eccentric Millionaire and Amateur Criminologist Lionel Twain ( played by Truman Capote , whose witless impersonation ought to make him ashamed of all the snotty things he has said about actors ) invites a group of the world 's greatest detectives to his mansion " for dinner and a murder . " On the guest list : Milo Perrier ( James Coco ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tough , trench-coated Sam Diamond ( Peter Falk ) and his loyal secretary Tess Skeffington ( Eileen Brennan ) ; Jessica Marbles , a cunningly dotty Englishwoman ( Elsa Lanchester ) and her ailing nurse Miss Withers ( Estelle Winwood ) ; Sidney Wang ( Peter Sellers ) , a grindingly polite Oriental given to compulsive aphorisms and faulty grammar ; and the unflappably elegant , bibulous society sleuths , Dick and Dora Charleston ( David Niven and Maggie Smith ) . Dealing with the guests are Bensonmum the Butler ( Alec Guinness ) , who is blind , and Yetta the Maid ( Nancy Walker ) , who can not hear or speak . It is one measure of Simon 's skill , however , that Yetta earns the movie 's biggest laugh without recourse to dialogue . <P> Compounded Confusion . The murder victim is ... well , one of the above , and all the rest are suspects . Everyone has a solution to the crime , each improbable , amusing and thoroughly confounding . The explanation at the final fade-out is compounded , confusion , a mess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even so , Murder by Death lacks the verbal facility of Tom Stoppard 's The Real Inspector Hound , its startling invention and its fine edge of intellectual gamesmanship . Stoppard mocked the conventional mystery form , but he expanded it even as he trifled with it . Simon just uses it for a setup . J.C .
