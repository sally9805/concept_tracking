txt Both Sides Rejoice as Israelis Prepare To Head East From the Lines at Suez // bank of the Suez Canal by Feb. 21 . By March 5 they are scheduled to take up new positions along a line some 12 miles east of the canal . Happy as they are to be going home , the Israeli soldiers who fought to capture the area west ' of the canal have mixed feelings about giving it up . " None of us want to keep it , " said Lieutenant Gidon , a 28-year-old reservist who was with the first paratroop units that dossed the canal in the second week of the war , " but the fighting was rough , some of our friends were killed , and we want to believe that it was worth it . " In exchange for withdrawing , the Israelis are getting what the diplomats call a " disengagement or forces . " The canal Is to be reopened to shipping and a United Nations-supervised buffer zone is to be established between the two armies . " If the disengagement actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of us will agree it was the right thing to do . But it is hard to believe at the moment , is n't it ? " The soldiers ' melancholy mood is mirrored by Israelis at home . Israelis are not accustomed to retreating , even as part of a negotiated agreement It is a traumatic experience for the country . In an apparent effort to cushion the impact on the national mood , Defense Minister Moshe Dayan has even tried to restrict news coverage of the withdrawal until the Egyptians are scheduled simultaneously to thin out their forces along the eastern bank of the canal . The Air Is Electric Despite the misgivings , there was an air of electric anticipation today among the Israeli soldiers in the Suez area . It was like a college campus on the last weekend before the end of the academic year . In the blasted buildings in Suez City and in field positions all around the outer enclave area , the soldiers were busy breaking down equipment , packing their gear in duffel bags and boxes and slinging it aboard army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burning everything they planned to leave behind , including accumulated mail from home that might show their addresses in Israel , Inside a former girls ' school on the southern edge of Suez city , a paratrooper carefully removed the tape from a vast collection of Playboy and Penthouse centerfold nudes that he had pasted on the wall behind his bed . " It took me three months to collect this harem , ' the trooper said with a smile . " They 're coming home with me . " A block away , at the window of a top-flooh apartment , another Israeli soldier pointed some 50 yards across the street to an Egyptian soldier manning a similar lookout . " I ca n't honestly say I 'll miss him , " the Israeli said . " but I 've gotten to know him these last few months . We 've exchanged a lot of cigarettes . " On the door of the apartment was an Arabic nameplate indicating it had once been occupied by Ahmed elHushni . Above this , in chalk , the soldier had written in Hebrew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thursday night another paratrooper unit , made up mostly of reservists in their late 20 's and early 30 's , celebrated its last night in Suez with a party in the kitchen of a shattered , half-built motel overlooking the Bay of Suez . A pretty girl singer in a brown sweater had come from Israel to entertain the men and a bottle of Johnny Walker was being passed hand to hand . It was a noisy party , the soldiers cheering extravagantly at each of the girl 's songs , drowning her out when they sang along with those they knew . For all the gaiety , many of the men at the party stared vacantly into space , alone in the crowd with their own thoughts . " Many of us already have one foot at home , " a bearded young officer explained earnestly . " We have been away for three months . Now we have to start worrying again about the problems we left behind  --  our jobs , our families , all the things we 've ignored since October . " The officer said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of their attitudes as a result of the war , " I know I see things differently now , " he said . " It 's hard to explain , but nothing is going to seem the same to me after this . I wonder whether my wife will be able to understand that . " The happiest soldiers in the Suez area these days are probably not the Israelis but the survivors of the decimated Egyptian Third Army . Some 15,000 strong , they have been encircled on the sandy eastern bank of the canal opposite Suez since October . On.Monday , when the Israelis fall back north from the Suez area , their ordeal will finally be over . " You should have seen them celebrate last Friday , the night the agreement was announced , " said an Israeli soldier who was ' manning a machine-gun post on the edge of the Bay of Suez . " They lit up the sky with flares and tracer bullets . It was a real - fiesta . " About 10,000 other Egyptian soldiers and civilian maintenance workers have been encircled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Before the agreement was signed last Friday those soldiers fought almost daily gun battles with the surrounding Israelis . In the last week , they have emerged from their hideouts . Early this morning they could be seen walking on the rubble-strewn streets and cooking cans of coffee over open fires . A . soldier in khaki was delicately arranging his wet laundry to dry on the concertina rolls of barbed wire outside his sandbagged position . Nearby , the officers and men of a Finnish contingent of United Nations troops have established themselves comfortably in a compound of luxurious private villas on the harborside . A Ping-Pong table and volleyball net has been set up on manicured lawns . Finns Have a Sauna Inside a green tent , the Finns have fashioned a field sauna , which the Israeli lookout in an adjacent apartment building said they use every morning and evening . " I do n't suppose they 're happy about moving from here into the Sinai , " he said . " They have a regular summer resort here . " About eight miles south of Suez is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Israelis on Oct. 24 . It was deserted today , save for a single Israeli naval patrol boat and a pack of stray dogs . At the end of the single pier were a Saudi Arabian freighter and a small South Yemeni t nker , abandoned the day of the Israeli attack . They will presumably be recommissioned after the Egyptians reoccupy the area Monday . One officer from Jerusalem had brought his 14-year-old son to have a look at Suez . " He may come back here as a tourist , some day , " the officer said , his hand on the boy 's shoulder , " but I hope he never has to fight over it again . "
