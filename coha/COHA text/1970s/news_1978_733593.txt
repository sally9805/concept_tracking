txt The Supreme Court today refused to give broadcasters and recording companies the right to copy , broadcast and sell excerpts from the White House tapes that led to the resignation of President Nixon and the criminal conviction of four of his aides . Dividing 7 to 2. the Justices concluded that the networks had no constitutional right that was enforceable in the courts to reproduce and circulate the taped material because Congress had established a system for access to the tapes . Texts of the taped material were printed in full at the time of the Watergate trial . The Court majority indicated today that anyone seeking sound reproductions of the tapes could apply to the General Services Administrator for permission under the Presidential Recordings Act of 1974 . No Guidelines for Access The decision involved only the 30 tapes , covering about 22 hours of White House conversations , that were played at the Watergate trial . Eventually , as a result of the procedures that could he adopted under the recordings act , the tapes may become available for copying and broadcast . But uncertainty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ require further lower court consideration , makes any action in the near future unlikely . The Court declined to give the administrator any guidelines for regulating public access to the tapes in the interests of privacy or executive pro liege , saying the case before it did not require such a ruling . In separate disscnttng opinions . Associate Justices Thurgood Marshall and John Paid Stevens said that they believed Congress had intended that the tapes be made fully available to the public , includContinued ing by broadcast and commercial recordings . It was the first victory for Mr. Nixon in three court controversies over the tapes . Of the White House figures whose voices are heard on the tapes , only Mr. Nixon opposed the networks ' application to Federal District Court to copy and broadcast portions of the tapes . William H. Jeffres Jr. , the lawyer who argued the case for the former President , said that he and Mr. Nixon were " gratified " by the ruling . " We have informed him of the decision , and he is pleased , but other than that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Disposition of Tapes In the majority opinion , Associate Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr . left unresolved the issue of disposition of the tapes . He ordered the lower court not to release the tapes and added in a footnote : " Because we have not addressed the issue of ownership of the copies at stake in his case , we do not speak to the proper disposition of them after remand . " Associate Justices Byron R. White and William J. Brennan Jr . agreed with the majority that the existence of the 1974 recordings act made it unnecessary for the Court to order the release of the tapes to the broadcasters , but they maintained that the material should be delivered from the custody of Federal district court to the General Services Administrator . Today 's decision in the case ( Nixon v. Warner Communications lnc. , No. 76-944 ) reversed a 1976 ruling of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia , which held that " the public 's right to inspect and copy the tapes " as part of the trial record was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resolved the dispute by considering " an additional unique element that was neither advanced by the parties nor given appropriate consideration by the courts below "  --  the existence of the Presidential Recording Act . " Congress has created an administrative procedure for processing and releasing to the public , on terms meeting with Congressional approval , all of petitioner 's Presidential materials of historical interest , including recordings of the conversations at issue here , " the Court said . " Because of this Congressionally prescribed avenue of public access , " the opinion continued , " we need not weigh the parties ' competing arguments as though the district court were the only potential source of information regarding these historical materials . The presence of an alternative means of public access tips the scales in favor of denying release . " Justice Powell went on to deny , however , the broadcasters ' contention that they were constitutionally entitled to copy and broadcast the White House recordings . He said that the broadcasters were not entitled to invoke freedom of the press contentions since the material on the tapes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintained that " the First Amendment generally grants the press no right to information about a trial superior to that of the general public . " As for the Sixth Amendment guarantee of public trial , Justice Powell said it " confers no special benefits on the press " beyond the right to attend the trial and report what they have observed . " The case arose when , six weeks into the Watergate trial , ABC , CBS , NBC and the Radio-Television News Directors Association asked District Judge John J. Sirca for permission to copy and broadcast material from the tapes . They were later joined by the Public Broadcasting System and Warner Communications Inc. , which operates a recording subsidiary . Another judge barred copying while the trial was in progress , and afterward Judge Sirica denied the request for immediate access to the tapes , saying that recordings , actively merchandised , might " generate excitement in an air of ridicule " while the defendants were appealing their conviction . But the court of appeals reversed Judge Sirica , sending the case back to district court for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that decision that the Supreme Court reversed today . Mr. Nixon contended throughout that he had a property interest in the sound of his own voice that the networks were seeking to appropriate , that his privacy would be infringed if the tapes were copied , that a 1974 Supreme Court ruling had permitted use of the tapes only in criminal prosecutions and that commercial recordings would be played " at cocktail parties in comedy acts of dramatic presentations " to his embarrassment and " mental anguish . " The two earlier tapes cases that Mr. Nixon lost involved his contention that executive privilege barred their delivery to the Watergate grand jury , rejected by the Supreme Court in 1974 , and his argument that the recordings act was an unconstitutional violation of separation of , powers . Congress had approved the act to limit Mr. Nixon 's access to his own papers at a time when he was not considered a reliable custodian , and the high court upheld the statute in 1977.                  @ @ @
