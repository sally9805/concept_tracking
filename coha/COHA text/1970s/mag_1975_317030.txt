Merchant ships moved through the Suez Canal last week for the first time since the Six-Day War eight years ago . In preparation for the canal 's formal reopening on June 5 , the West German freighters Mnsterland and Nordwind sailed to Port Said from the Bitter Lakes along with 13 other ships . The rusting carriers had been trapped there since the canal was blocked in 1967 . Discerning a parallel between the preparations for the canal reopening and the broader peace negotiations that have made it possible , Egyptian Cartoonist Salah Jaheen in al Ahram last week drew President Anwar Sadat piloting a tug named " New Diplomatic Drive " and hauling a ship designated " Arab Policy " out of a diplomatic bitter lake of intransigency . <P> The good ship " Diplomatic Drive " was certainly busy last week . To emphasize Egypt 's peace hopes , Sadat in connection with the canal reopening declared Port Said and the surrounding area a free-trade zone . In preparation for his June 1 summit meeting in Salzburg with President Ford , Sadat was set to embark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first visit ever by an Egyptian President to Baghdad ( see story page 32 ) . In Moscow , meanwhile , the Soviets completed a series of strategy conferences with Arab diplomats from Egypt , Iraq and Syria and with Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat . This week Premier Aleksei Kosygin will pay official visits to Tunisia and Libya . <P> Common Position . The Soviet-Arab sessions were inconclusive . The Russians were obviously relieved by the failure of Secretary of State Henry Kissinger 's bilateral shuttle negotiations . As an alternative , the Russians have demanded " an early resumption " of the Geneva Conference , but as of last week it appeared that they were having second thoughts about reconvening the talks without thorough preparation . As one Western diplomat in Moscow put it , the Soviets were having trouble getting " all their Arabs lined up in a row . " Last week Pravda , with some irritation , observed that " success at Geneva would be facilitated by a common Arab position on the Palestinian issue . " <P> Moscow fears that a Soviet-sponsored Geneva @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collapsed . Thus the U.S.S.R. is willing to let what it calls " bilateral separate deals , " meaning resumption of Egyptian-Israeli talks under U.S. aegis , continue in tandem with Geneva discussions . So far Washington seems uncertain about what will emerge from President Ford 's double summit-with Sadat in Salzburg and ten days later in Washington with Israeli Premier Yitzhak Rabin . <P> The President at his press conference last week explained only that " we 're in the process of reassessing our Middle East policy , and they Sadat and Rabin can make a very valuable contribution with their on-the-spot recommendation . " One critic in the Israeli government last week suggested that the summits are self-serving . " They are-designed to underline the importance of the U.S. as a power in the Middle East , " he said . " The region is becoming the testing ground for American credibility after Viet Nam . " Probably the most that can be hoped for , however , is that they will provide a flexible atmosphere in which shuttle talks can be resumed in another form .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
