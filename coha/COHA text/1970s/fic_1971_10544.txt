To stop from thinking of himself he thought of his work . He felt a feverish impatience with his work , the progress he was making  --  twoyears jammed into a year and a half did not please him , left him exhausted and grim . Five years jammed into four ; eight years jammed into six and a half . . . . No , he was not pleased , he did not have time to be pleased . Alone in his- room , he contemplatedthe books that were always before him , yet to be read . He ran his hand along the edge of the books , those hundreds of pages , mysterious from the outside , neutral . Most of the books were secondhand . He was $2500 in debt ; he had to take a semester off to work , but the work was not enough to pay back much of his debt to the University  --  just work in a boys ' residence hall , dirty , exhausting work in the kitchen unloading big containers of food , scraping piles of plates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out while the very hairs on his head prickled with revulsion . ... Time yawned . At the table in his room that he used as a desk he leaned forward and cradled his head in his arms , feeling how raw , how exposed his brain was , how in danger it was of disintegrating . But time resumed . Daylight resumed , after even the worst of his dim , baffling nightmares , and he awoke to normal life . He was in disguise as a normal young man . Twenty years old : he lived in a basement room on Williams Street in Ann Arbor , Michigan . It was his first year of medical school and he had classes from eight in the morning until five in the afternoon ; then he went back in the early evening to take part in experiments some of his professors were doing  --  insulin tests , dermatological tests , one of the worst of them a psychological test in which Jesse and other students lay in darkened rooms for forty hours , without any sounds to distract them , losing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anatomy laboratory , a pickled cadaver , much-handled . Death stank . He came back to his meager dripping room with the raw odor of chemical preservatives on his hands . Death was familiar in such shabby corpses , it had the air of a public place , a public rest room . It was not really important . What mattered were the structures of the body 's systems , the utter undissolvabic reality of their existence in any body , alive or dead . ... He was twenty-one years old and still in that Williams Street room , walking several miles every day back and forth to the MedicalCenter , his mind sorting out problems , experiments , the casep205histories of patients in his clinical work he had to prepare . He studiedpathology ; he became fascinated with the microscopic . Sick for two weeks in the university infirmary with an influenza that was going around , he dreamed of the cells of tissues , the bizarre changes of fetal cells in animals exposed to radiation , and it seemed to him that death would not be so terrifying : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The reversible ones panickedhim because they must be handled , must be explained , life must be continued . . . . His hands were rough from steel wool and scouring pads and disinfectant and the splintery handles of mops , so he changed jobs  --  he was an attendant at a city welfare clinic for one winter , never quite well himself , his head filled with facts , formulae , the important faces of his professors , and the blurred , dying faces of the very poor , who were always trapping him into conversations : You are so young , the old people sighed , breaking his heart . What is it like to be young ? They were baffled , not rememberingtheir own youth . No , it was impossible to think of them as young . Jesse wanted to turn from them and cover his face , feeling his skin , his facial structure , as if it were a deceit , a mockery . He would have liked to scream at them that he was not young . He had never been young . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after working at the clinic or after laboratory classes , or just because he had the opportunity , in any public men 's room . He was very poor . He could not afford toothpaste . He never read newspapers or magazines , never saw any movies , never listened to the radio . Bleary-eyed from a night of work , he would show up at classes to overhear other students talkingexcitedly of names that meant little to him  --  names of Europeannations , names of American politicians . These young men spoke casually and intimately in a language Jesse could not quite understand . And while he was listening to it , trying to listen to it , part of him would withdraw coldly , sensing that there was nothing in such conversation for him , nothing of value . Such things are not very real , he thought . What was real were his laboratory reports , his examinations , his grades , the way his throat closed up at the smell of food . Food , what mountains of food !  --  metamorphosed into garbage , scraped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stench overwhelming . In the hospitals , people lay flat on their backs and tried to eat , tried to swallow , in order to keep liv/ing . If weight loss was too rapid they would be fed in other ways and , with the body 's wise instinct , they knew about these ways and so they ate , tried to eat perpetually until they died or recovered and were sent home .... Jesse had time to contemplate the noise made by mouths as food was eaten . Sometime during his second year of medical school , after he got sick , he became unable to eat in the4 ' 1 presence of others and even their eating upset him , though he tried not to show it . He drank a lot of coffee . He ate at the table in his room irregularly , spooning food out of tin cans he heated in hisIP sink by running hot water over them . By always focusing his eyes upon what he was reading , he was able to eat quickly and invisibly , not really conscious of eating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ache of cold , the ache of hunger , the sleepiness in his classmates ' faces , the dull anemicdpi camaraderie of overworked students . Jesse 's head often buzzed with fatigue . He saw himself again and again approaching a patient in a bare white room , the walls no more than concrete blocks , the lighting raw , fluorescent , vicious , he saw the patient transformed into a corpse , a thing to be fingered , wondered at , labeled , studied . Again and again he dreamed of approaching someone ; he dreamed of the yellowed white sheet , the stillness , the toenails , the body hairs , the utterly simple dead face .... He told this dream to no one , and only once did he break down . He was a clerk in pediatrics , assigned to a children 's psychiatric ward ; his supervisor invited him into his office , offered him a cigarette , asked him how he was doing , and Jesse began to weep . " I 'm very happy to be here . I do n't know how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jesse said hysterically . Multitudes of faces converge into a single blur : a sea of crowding life into a geographical unit , a nation . Is there a common language ? What do the imploring hands mean ? Jesse saw them threaten him before he fell asleep , and part of his mind acted at once to block them out , to overcome them . No . No . He was good at saying no , at withdrawing . He resisted people . His classmates invited him out drinking with them , but he resisted . He was always in a hurry . He had a part-time job ; he had two part-time jobs . He owed more money to the University . He caught mononucleosis and was sick for three long weeks , fearing sleep and desiring it , trying to hold himself back from the twilight of drugged sleep where dreamsp207might operate freely . What a crowd of faces sought him out in his sleep ! Impossible to interpret their messages in such a mob  --  better to insist upon darkness , the icy silence of the vacuum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the absolute zero of the polar regions ! It was during this sickness that he met Anne-Marie . He was twenty-one years old when he went to court to change his name : Jesse Vogel . He was twenty-four years old and now he lived on the third floor of a rooming house on South University ; he still ate hurriedly at his desk , when he bothered to eat . Sometimeshe glanced up from his work and knew there was something he must think of , someone he must recall . . . and he would think of Anne-Marie with a peculiar , flinching violence . She would be Anne-Marie Vogel in a few months . Anne-Marie Vogel . He loved her and he resented his need to think of her . He could not get her close enough to him , could not break through the boundaries of their flesh so that she would be near enough for him to forget . Therefore she drained him , drained his energies when he needed to work , to study , to memorize , to plan . There were other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where other Jesses existed , sinister and unkillable ; and he accepted them , he could not rid himself of them . If he could have snipped certain neural pathwaysin his brain bloodlessly , he would have clone it  --  with one of the neat curving little surgical instruments he had become accustomed to handling !  --  but it was impossible . He would always live inside himself . He would always live out those separate , frozen lives : But another part of him , the real Jesse , planned confidently for the future , thought confidently of this girl who would become his wife . After all , his life had become predictable . He was forcing his future into place . He felt his body becoming mechanical , predictable , very sane . " Human beings fear mechanisms because they do not understand that they are mechanisms themselves . Perfect machines , " one of his professors said . This professor lectured in neurochemistry ; he was a guest in the department , from Boston . Jesse attended his lectures , auditing the course because he had n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was fascinated with the man 's slow , gentle , gentlemanly manner , his lapses into " unscientific " words like destiny , beauty , creation  --  such words evoked in Jesse a sense of dreaminess , of memory , as if he had heard much of this before but could not quite recall it . " There is no machine as perfect as the human body , nothing like it in all creation , " Dr. Cady stated , speaking to an amphitheater of sleepy students , Jesse among them , attentive and intrigued , though he often came to this early-morningclass without having slept the night before . It was easier to stay up all night instead of sleeping a few hours . A kind of excited momentum carried him along . Then , the next night , he could sleep an ordinary five or six hours and wake refreshed , as if he had n't missed any sleep at all . During such stretches of activity he had n't any appetite either , and he felt surges of an unaccountable joy , as if he were pushing himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his spirit emerging muscular and powerful and very sane . Yes , even his spirit was become automated , mechanized . It worked perfectly for him . Ile had only to direct it and it responded . It grew wise . He got special permission to work late and sometimes , in the nearly-deserted laboratory , he suddenly felt a sense of panic , as if a door might open at any moment and someone might walk in  --  a dream ballooning out of the empty corridor outside . If he could not control the panic with a cigarette or one of the little pills AnneMariehad given him , he went outside , hurrying out into the street . His heart pumped , his eyes were wild . He walked around the block , around the large darkened buildings of the Medical Center , sensing himself absolutely alone , as if he had stepped out of the normal dimension of time and were already in his own future . There was sanctity , purity , there he could contemplate himself without panic . What was time ? The element in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He knew that a living cell performs certain miraculous acts , that it contains a kind of electricity , and that a dead cell performs no acts , goes through no sequence of characteristic , identifying acts , and is nothing . The definition of life , then , was only one of behavior : the living cell behaved , the dead cell did nothing . The living cell was godly , the dead cell a zero . Between the two there was a universe of time . This overwhelmed him . Fascinated him . He had no time to be fascinated because he had to work , yet his mind came back again and again to such facts . . . . He had changed his name to Vogel in 1945 . Jesse Vogel . The end of the war , the beginning of Jessep209Vogel . The facts he must be concerned with in his own private , interior life were simple and unmysterious and unfascinating : he would begin an internship in Chicago in July ; he would marry Anne-Marie ; he would establish a certain life , professional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the universe ? . . . Sometimes , on a night when his nerves were jumpy from too much coffee , too many half-hallucinations of opening doors , cells shaking themselves to life when they were dead , precise and dead , he went out to a drugstore and telephoned Anne-Marie . She woke , answered at once , before the telephone could ring a second time , because she lived with her mother and did not belong wholly to Jesse . He could see her only a few times a week because he was so busy . Always , telephoning her late at night , his heart tripped absurdly as he listened to the distant , fragile ring that seemed already transformed by Anne-Marie 's presence . When she answered in her soft voice , " Jesse ? " he closed his eyes in relief . She had answered his call . She was real . " Hello , " he would say . " It 's just me . How are you ? Did I wake you up ? Did you have a hard day ? " This surprised him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice . He had forgotten that he was so young and demanding . If she was tired herself , Anne-Marie never said so ; she insisted that she had not really been asleep but only lying in bed , thinking of him . And Jesse would ask her about her work that day , about the other nurses , about her mother , and he would tell her about his own work , going back over the events of his crowded day , the conversationshe had had with other people , the state of his landlady 's domain  --  there were always minor domestic crises in the rooming house , with Jesse at the center , a kind of intermediary between the landlady and her other tenants . After a few minutes of this Jesse would begin to slow down , to relax . Anne-Marie would say sleepily , " I love you . . . , you 're so serious . . . you work so hard .... " There was a kind of lightness about her that she seemed to insist upon in spite of her nursing schedule and her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him lightly , childishly ; even her problems were twisted about to seem trivial . She slighted herself : the complaints she offered to Jesse were not serious . A sense of gratitude for her , for her kindness , was focused for Jesse in the clumsy hearts carved on the inside of the telephone booth by high school girls  --  so many hearts , all of them touchingly distorted , dancing before his eyes  --  " When can I see you ? When tomorrow ? " Jesse would always ask urgently . And , waiting anxiously for her reply , he closed his eyes and saw Anne-Marie , this long-haired , healthy , pretty girl , freed of the very restraints of gravity itself , released in her perfect white nurse 's uniform from the old hospital in which she worked or from the aging house in which she lived , released to his arms . Anne-Marie Vogel . She loved him and it caused him to think , on the darkest of his dark cloudy nights , that he was really a normal young man . Not isolated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six feet two inches tall , strong in the shoulders and self-consciously erect , his hair brushed back from his forehead , thick and slightly darkening now , no longer so blond ; his gaze was clear and cautious , a level stare that scanned everything before him , out to the limits of the spatial horizon , before settling on what must be seen . There was a slownessabout him , a ponderousness , that seemed to collide with a certain impatience in his speech , as if he were often prodding himself awake out of a confusion of memory , the very brusqueness of his words meant to wake Jesse himself . Moods rose and fell in him , challenged him and were vanquished , moods of intense happiness  --  inhis laboratory work and in his reading and in his love for Anne-Marie  --  and moods of sudden , almost abandoned depression , a gaiety of depression , as if he knew everything was lost and could do nothing about it , nothing to save himself , why bother ? Catchinghis own eye in a mirror he sometimes noticed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tone of his skin heated , pink-toned , very healthy on even his dreariest Ann Arbor days , as if the subdued and even shy manner that was his usual personality were underscoredby this brazen , curious stare . He had avoided people for years now , perplexed by their response to him and not really wanting to do battle with it or comprehend it : it must have been that his face , in repose , had a skeptical or argumentative look , because he sensed a nervousness , a slight hostility , in men his own age or older when they were in his company . " No , no , people like you , people are very fond of you , " Anne-Marie insisted . But he did not believe her . With her he felt confidence  --  even normality  --  he felt oddly protected . As long as he was with her he did not even need to believe her.  |p211And  yet , when he was away from her , he sometimes could not recall her face . He felt her essence , her presence , but only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beauty on a billboard , advertising a brand of cigarettes or a soft drink . One quiet night in April , 1951 , he left the pathology laboratory late , around eleven , and as he passed a group of men on the sidewalkhe noticed that one of the men glanced toward him , then turned to look at him . He did not return the look . The young men were mostly students and he did not want to be invited out with them , he had no time or interest ... no time for drinking , no interest in talking , arguing . He was a little dizzy from not having anything to eat since noon . But when he was out on his feet like this , outside in public , the dizziness usually abated . He was too proud to walk weakly . Anne-Marie was working at the hospital and so he could n't see her ; she would not go off duty until morning . So he walked quickly toward home , feeling the start of a familiar panic ; he walked fast , as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home before it struck . All day long he had been thinking about the utterly simple , grave pronouncements of the lecturer in neurochemistry , Dr. Cady : The world is our construction , peopled by us ; it is a mystery . All we know of the world , even our most precise laboratory findings , rests on the perception of the senses , but this very knowledge can not reveal the relations of the senses to the outside world . Jesse had been struck by this ; he had wanted to laugh in astonishment . He wanted to seek out Cady and argue with him . Cady was a short , slight , rather delicate man ; Jesse would have to stoop a little to talk to him , he would have to speak gently to him . But he wanted , he wanted . . . he wanted to argue . . . . Is n't the great lesson of science control ? The lessons of homeostasis and cybernetics : control ? What else mattered ? If he had control of himself , Jesse Vogel , then nothing else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was feeding energy into his legs . He could hear faint noises from the fraternity houses on the other side of the campus , up along Washtenaw , and he knew that what had seemed so deeply and ominously silent to him was not silence at all but was filled with the special small language of human beings . But he could not understand this language . Even AnneMarie'swords , her love , her perfumy essence  --  he could not under- stand it . So he walked fast , heading home , hurrying home on a pleasant cloudy night in April . What would await him at the roominghouse ? It was a kind of home for him ; yes , he was fond of it , dependent upon it  --  the other tenants laughed at him because he was so easily victimized by the landlady , who was without a husband , perhaps divorced ? widowed ? abandoned ? and who got Jesse to leave his books and run errands for her , beat carpets in the back yard as they hung , enormously heavy , from a straining clothesline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child with glasses . But he liked living there . It was filled with the noise of other students , with their yelping laughter and radios and heavy footsteps , with the landlady 's scolding of her daughter , but he liked it  --  it helped to dispel his own thoughts , his memories , the problems of his being . Control . That was all he wanted . The noises other people made helped to dispel Jesse 's private burdens a little . He did not want to complain , even to himself , and so he blocked off the channels that led back to certain thoughts , just as he had recklessly and desperately sold that car of his , at a great loss , just to be rid of it , rid of it permanently , years ago here in Ann Arbor . ... But at times , when his panic threatened , he had the idea that his private memories fed somehow into a vast universal memory , a sorrow not his own that he had not lived through and therefore could not erase , even by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ populated the universe , that constructed the universe . It was not local . It was not even contained in the vast wastes of the war or in the jumble of history in this century . Time was mobbed with people . How could he establish himself , constructhimself , in such a mob ... ? It was harmonious , unlocalized , spread out evenly everywhere . There was nothing human to it . He wanted to argue with that professor . He wanted to insist that these things did not matter . . . . No , he wanted to embrace AnneMarieviolently , sweetly , he wanted to whisper these things to her , he wanted to frighten her with their terror and then calm her , soothe her , bring her back to the cheerful busyness of her usual life . But he knew that she would not understand . He had no right to force her to understand . If he loved her he would guard her from such thoughts ; if he loved her he would not really bring her into himself , into his consciousness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had learned from the few novels he had read in hisp213lifetime that love demanded rescue . He must rescue his beloved from danger , even the danger of himself . The story demanded that a male rescue a female from danger and he would be punished if he failed ... . Glancing back over his shoulder , Jesse saw someone following him half a block away . This person  --  a man  --  looked familiar , but Jesse did not have time to see who it was before he turned back again uneasily . This street led past residence halls and was thereforenoisy . Jesse glanced at the rows of lighted dormitory windows and felt a pang of jealousy for the simplicity of these undergraduates ' lives  --  when he had worked in dining halls he 'd envied the boys ' sloppiness , their loud herding instincts . He felt an impulse to go into one of the halls , just to avoid the man behind him . It was probably a classmate of his , wanting help . Wanting to borrow notes . At least everyone knew enough not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the university more money than ever , almost three thousand dollars . . . . Jesse turned up one of the walks and went into a residence hall , walking quickly , as if he lived here , and once inside he paused to wait a few minutes . It was crowded here . Jesse had always felt oddly benevolent toward the undergraduates at the university , though they had money and he was poor ; he thought of them as children , they were so boisterous and sure of themselves . They lived in rooms jammed with junk , dirty clothes and towels flung everywhere , sheets that went unchanged for weeks , they played poker and drank happily and stupidly ; they were children and could be blamed for nothing . Those who did not live in the residence halls lived in palatial fraternity houses  --  enormous houses where music blared and curtains were blown outsidewindows . Jesse thought of these young people as jammed together warmly , perpetually . They came alive in crowds . Their faces brightened in herds . He envied them but felt , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctor he would be serving them . After a few minutes he took a side door out to the street again and hurried the few blocks to his rooming house . Now no one was following him . He went up to his room on the third floor and saw that the door was ajar  --  he had evidently left it open in his hurry to leave that morning  --  and then , in the doorway , he was shocked to see that someone was in the room , sitting at his " desk , " the cluttered table he worked at . It was Dr. Monk , " Monk , " the man who assisted Dr. Cady in the neurochemistry course . Jesse realized now that Monk had been following him . " Hello ! " Monk said with a big smile . He got to his feet and extended his hand . For a moment Jesse stood in the doorway , too stunned to react . Then , feebly , he shook hands with Monk . He could not help glancing around the room , as if checking it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home . I did n't think you 'd mind . You do n't mind ? " Monk said . He had caught Jesse 's instinctive checking of the room and this seemed to amuse him . " I swear I have n't taken a thing ! I have n't been tempted even by that stale sweet roll on the radiator , I swear . . . . Are you comfortable here ? You 're fairly isolated , at least , on the third floor . " " Yes . . . , " Jesse said vaguely , not catching all this . " You 're wondering how I knew where you live ? " Monk said . Jesse was too confused to reply . " I knew that you certainly did n't live in that residence hall , " Monk said with a grin . " Well , why do n't you come in ? Sit down ? You 'll make me think I 'm not welcome . " Jesse knew Monk slightly . He was an instructor in the medical school , having taken a degree somewhere else  --  Minnesota @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year 's residency at Michigan . He was supposed to be brilliant . He attended all of Dr. Cady 's lectures , sitting up at the front of the room in the left-hand corner , facing both Cady and the class , leaning forward attentively , earnestly ; he corrected examinations for Cady and ran a laboratory section . Jesse had had a few hurried conversations with him about something Cady had touched upon , and once he had met Monk in a building late in the afternoon , in that dreary yellowish late afternoon of university buildings that is like a condition of the soul  --  but he had never had time to accept Monk 's invitations to have coffee together or to go out drinking . Now he felt awkward , apologetic , as if this cramped room were Monk 's and he himself an intruder . " Yes , it is n't bad up here , " Monk said . " I wondered where you lived . You look so incredibly serious all the time , it 's difficult to think of you living anywhere , actually sleeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all these books yours ? Jesus . Are thosep215more books over there ? You truly are a serious student , are n't you ? My friend Bob Winslow lives on the first floor here . He says the landlady is a little crazy and that she takes advantage of you . Is that true ? " " No , " Jesse said . Monk laughed . Jesse smiled a small , patient smile . What did this man want ? Why did n't he leave ? But Monk did not quite meet his gaze  --  he was a big man , looking a few years older than his age because of his slack , thinning blond hair , which was uncombed , and the pouches beneath his eyes . He was about thirty . He had an abrupt nervous laugh , a generous , good-natured manner , tufts of eyebrowst that rose continually in mock surprise , a voice that was too loud for intimate conversation . He was too loud , too large . The few times Jesse had spoken with Monk he had felt uneasy , uncomfortable , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes . That way you could n't read : the print was just a threat . " I saw you leave the lab tonight and wanted to say hello . It 's about time we got to know each other ; you 'll be leaving in a few months , wo n't you ? Where are you going ? " " Chicago , I hope . " " Where , LaSalle ? " " Yes . " " How are things going with you ? " " All right , " Jesse said . Jesse sat on the edge of his bed . Monk was sitting in Jesse 's chair . He crossed his legs uneasily , as if he sensed Jesse 's irritation . Then he smiled , ready to begin a new topic , approaching Jesse from another angle . He spoke buoyantly of the work he was **34;12990;TOOLONG for Cady , on a big research grant  --  endless cuttings of cats . " To be factual and therefore more pedanticand confusing , " he said , " we 're working with a monosynaptic reflex pathway of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What are you doing ? " Jesse asked . " Oh  --  " Monk said , waving the question away , " oh , I think it will turn out to be for Cady 's private fortune ; maybe he wants to perfect another barbiturate and patent it . . . you know he 's already wealthy from a patent he has ? No , did n't you know that ? I thought everyone knew . "  | " I do n't know much about Cady . " " You admire him , though . Enormously . " " I suppose so , " Jesse said . " It shows in your face , even at nine in the morning . Obvious adulation . It 's good to see that kind of thing , even at nine in the morning . " Jesse was silent . " Well , yes , Cady is an extraordinary man and there are n't many like him . I do n't blame you for admiring him . We all do . " Monk 's enthusiasm did not seem sincere to Jesse . It was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prowled restlessly around the room and back and forth over Jesse 's face . His face seemed larger than an ordinary face , as if it had been stretched , kneaded out of shape , a clown 's face , the features meant for a stage and its exaggerating lights . Jesse had always heard of his brilliance and of his " goodheartedness "  --  whichmeant he tutored students for nothing , he sometimes lent them money , he was generally available for help with people who were having trouble understanding Cady . " Of course , none of us know Dr. Cady very well . I like his clothes myself . Excellent . He has a daughter , did you know ?  --  a brilliant young woman in chemistry , biochemistry , something like that . At Harvard . " Jesse nodded vaguely . He wondered how long Monk would keep on talking . " Look , Jesse , do n't be offended . I only wanted to say hello to you . We had a fascinating conversation that day , do you remember ? a few weeks ago ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Did I ? " Jesse did not remember this . " Yes , you mentioned it . I have insomnia too . But it gives us more hours of the day , it prolongs our conscious lives  --  right ? Of course , I have a photographic memory and am therefore something of a freak . You 're not like that , are you ? You do n't have a genuine photographic memory ? " " Not the real thing , no , " Jesse said coldly . " You 're not a freak , no , I did n't think so . There 's a fourteen year-old kid in physics here , do you know about him ? Skinny , pop eyed , a real genius . He knows everything . He 's going right for the Ph.D. , the hell with the B.A. He makes me feel very old suddenly . Did I tell you I 'm contemplating another kind of life ? "  | " No . " " Not marriage , like you , but another kind of life altogether .... " In spite of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do ? " he asked . Monk shrugged his shoulders . " Retreat . Retire . I think of NorthernMinnesota , I think of lakes and pure water and silence ... I 'd like to write poems , I 'd like to wear this perpetual stink off my hands . . . . But they 'd need a doctor up there ; sure enough some female would start to give birth and they 'd call me in , and I 'd be Dr. Monk again , I could n't escape . . . . I put in a year as a G.P. , you know . " Jesse did not remember if he knew this or not  --  but why should he have known it ? He was not a friend of Monk 's . " Everyone thinks of dropping out occasionally , " Jesse said . It was the first thing he had really said to Monk ; he felt Monk 's satisfaction . " Jesse , you should call me Trick . My friends call me Trick . My name is Talbot Waller Monk , an impossible name , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the anesthetic , and so everyone calls me Trick . Do you know why ? " His manner was open and childlike and yet not very sincere . " I do n't know why , " Jesse said . " Maybe you play tricks on people . " " No , tricks are vulgar . . . mere tricks are vulgar , " Monk laughed . " No . I simply push the logistics of a situation as far as it will go ; I exploit the dimension of the possible rather than the probable . But I do n't intrude upon anyone 's destiny . It 's all predictable , in a way . Jesse had heard of his practical jokes at second and third hand , but he had never paid much attention to them . " I did a fairly good impersonation of Rothman last fall , when he could n't make a genetic talk at Michigan State . They thought I was the great Rothman himself , " Monk laughed . " But really I was much better because I can at least speak the English language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had known him ... and yet they believed I was Rothman for some reason .... " " You do n't look anything like him . " " Of course not . He 's a Jew from New York , slumming out here , and I 'm an archetypal Midwestern personality . Actually , I 'm very prejudiced . In the interests of science I hide my bias , but in my soul I 'm really anti-Semitic . Come on , do n't look so surprised , why ca n't we be honest with each other ? You and I are Midwestern types . Look at us . We even look something alike , in spite of my ugly face . I 'm really very narrow in spite of my girth . " His face had flushed with a kind of fanciful shame . Jesse stared at him , uncomprehending . " Well , it 's late , I should be leaving , " Monk said . But he did not move . Something caught his eye : a towel of Jesse 's on a rack just inside his closet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the initials J.P. ?  --  that towel , I mean . But no , never mind , I 'm too curious for my own good . I only wanted to say hello to you and to congratulate you . " " On what ? " " Oh , on your work , your good grades , your industry , all that ... . Cady asks to see the good papers and he was impressed with yours . Especially when I told him you were n't really enrolled in the course . He 's got this idea that people out here , non-Harvard people , are idiots , and when anyone does well it seems to astonish him . He asked me a few questions about you . I told him what I knew  --  nobody knows much about you , Jesse , except that you 're bad competition  --  you'vebeen around for a while but nobody knows much . I ran into my old friend Anne-Marie Seton the other day  --  " " Anne-Marie ? Do you know her ? " Monk seemed to be screwing up one side of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment  --  as if guessing that Jesse was on the verge of anger  --  his face relaxed . It took on an appearance of slack , respectful , moronic seriousness . Jesse 's heart began to pound as if he were in the presence of something deadly . " Yes , of course I know Anne-Marie . I knew her when she was in nursing school . She lives in Ann Arbor with her mother . . . a pretty girl .... " He spoke quickly and tonelessly , with a kind of apologetic smile . " It just occurred to me , " Monk said , " in talking with Cady , that I did n't know you either . I think I would like to know you . As a scientist I have a natural interest in superior personalities . " Now his manner changed , the mock-apologetic look drained away ; he became again lordly , decorous , very patient , as if he were much older than Jesse . Jesse felt a renewal of his initial assessment of this man , made years ago : he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " A superior personality reduces me to jell-O . In the pres/ence of the great Benjamin Cady I provide an ashtray for him with my hands , automatically , unconsciously , and he taps his ashes out in my hands just as automatically , accepting me as an ashtray without even thinking about it . I feel flattered . I run out to get him coffee , but it ca n't just be ordinary coffee ; he 's very fussy . I arranged for the apartment he has . His daughter is coming to join him . I arranged for that . ' We sit in his office practically knee to knee , talking , but then something happens and he does n't seem to want to talk about his work , he wants to talk suddenly about custombuiltautomobiles or Mozart or an Italian cheese , and I feel my soul deflate , the air seep out of it tragically . . . . What good is it , really , a life of science ? a life in science ? " " There is n't any other life , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is n't any other life , " Jesse repeated . " Why not ? " When Jesse did not answer , Monk pressed his fist against his chest and held that position for several seconds , as if he were thinkingvery seriously . " No , you 're wrong . We 're devoting our lives to bodies , masses . We 'd be better off perfecting explosives . Man is a mouth and an anus . Man is n't worth our devotion . " " Arc you deliberately stupid ? " Jesse asked . This caught Monk by surprise : he stared at Jesse . Then he smiled coldly . " Yes , deliberately . It 's part of my style , " he said . He got to his feet . He was wearing mismatched clothes  --  an old brown sweater and gray corduroy trousers shiny at the knees . It was rumored that he had money but that he never spent it on himself . " I 'm sorry I offended you , Jesse . I know you 're devoted to medicine . You 've consecrated yourself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air leaking out of a balloon . . . . You can hear it escaping if you listen . Yes , I 'm leaving . I 'll leave . You did n't go to see her tonight , eh ? " Jesse stood . " ' Why do you talk about her like that ? " " Like what ? " " In that way  --  that voice  --  What do you want ? " Monk spread his hands . " Absolutely nothing . I do n't understand you . I came only to congratulate you on the success of your work  --  I 'm very jealous of you , your youth and your energy . And your pretty little girl . " " We 're going to be married , " Jesse said.  | " Oh ? " " Yes . Married . " They stared at each other . Monk lingered in the doorway , filling it with his slightly rounded shoulders . He smiled . " I do n't think you 're going to get married , " he said finally . " Get the hell out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood in the doorway of his room . His face twitched , he felt like running after Monk and grabbing hold of him .... Instead , he went to the window and looked down to the street . A lonely street . A feeble light . In a minute or so Monk 's figure appeared , large and grave , the shoulders bent forward a little . His walk was odd , as if premeditated , each step planned with care : now I will cross the street , now I will step up onto the curb , now I will glance over my shoulder to see if Jesse is watching me ... . Jesse drew back from the window . His heart pounded with a dull , puzzled anger . " Bastard , " he said aloud . He did not intend to sleep , so he lay down on top of his bedspread , pushing a few books aside . He thought about Monk . He thought about Anne-Marie . Something surged in his blood , a heady chemical released by such thoughts , an anger close to elation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slept and jerked awake suddenly . He sat up , checked the time  --  quarter after five . He went to his worktable and sat down . A pile of books . Papers , lab reports . It took him a while to remember that Dr. Monk , " Trick " Monk , had been sitting here talking to him hours before . I came only to congratulate you , Monk had said . Why was his mouth so dry now ? He must have slept unexpectedly and breathed through his mouth . He had not intended to sleep . Everything was slowed down in him now , at five in the morning , and he could not quite remember what Monk had said that had angered him . Maybe he 'd imagined it . Monk was always joking , he had the reputation of being a good person , generous and wise ... . Jesse worked until quarter to eight , when he ran downstairs and over to the hospital where Anne-Marie was on duty . He got to the hospital five minutes before the shift changed , so he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ row of people were already sitting beneath a big clock . Anne-Marie would take this way out . Thep221hospital smelled good to him . A yellowed old woman , sitting near the door to the Outpatients ' Clinic , tugged at his arm . " You have to take a number and wait your turn , " she said importantly . All the patients were holding large plastic cards with numbers on them , the kind used in meat markets . " Thank you , " Jesse said politely . " But I 'm not waiting for the clinic . " The activity of the corridor distracted him . Nurses coming in , wearing light spring coats over their uniforms ; nurses preparing to go off duty , yawning . Their movements  --  the rapid soft-soled motion of their feet  --  pleased Jesse . There were no men around , no men on duty . The doors to the x-ray rooms and the Pathology Lab were still locked . There were only the nurses , most of them firmbodiedyoung women , brisk in their white uniforms and pale transparentstockings . The door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly came through . Jesse sucked in his breath at the sight of her . A beautiful copper-haired girl . A stranger . She saw him and faltered . One hand rose as if in defense . But then she smiled broadly and they hurried to meet each other . Jesse wondered if his face showed that strange , evil elation of the night before . " Is anything wrong ? " Anne-Marie whispered . " No . Nothing . I just wanted to see you , " Jesse said . He had taken her hand . His eyes seemed to grab at her . " Could n't you sleep last night ? You look so tired . . . , " she said nervously . " I just wanted to see you . " They walked toward the exit . Jesse was aware of the outpatients watching them , sitting obediently along the wall with their plastic cards in hand . But he could not release Anne-Marie 's hand and he could not stop staring at her . He felt the tension in his face , in the muscles of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyone waking up and wanting sleeping pills and running us to death . . . . Oh , I must look awful , " AnneMariesaid . " You look very beautiful , " Jesse said . She lifted her face to him as if offering herself . Her eyes were large with weariness  --  dark brown eyes , almost black , fascinating . Yes , now that he was with her he remembered her exactly . " I was thinking about you all last night , " Jesse said . Anne-Marie smiled uneasily . " You could n't sleep again . . . ? " " I slept for a while . I feel fine , " Jesse said . " You 're sure that nothing is wrong ? " " I felt that I wanted to see you , " he said quickly . " I was thinking about you . . . I was talking about you .... " " Oh , with who ? You were talking about me ? " " No one you know , a man named Monk . He 's an instructor in neurochemistry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him ? " Jesse said . " Who ? What is his name ? " " Monk . " " That 's a strange name . " " They call him Trick . I do n't know his real naive  --  Talbot , maybe  --  Talbot Monk . Do you know him ? " She shook her head . Jesse squeezed her hand , as if to reassure her that he believed her . He took her gently by the arm and walked her out to the parking lot . " He 's about thirty , he has blond hair , he 's big , tall , going to fat a little . . . there 's something strange about him . . . everyone likes him , he 's very friendly , very popular . ... You do n't remember him ? " " No . Why should I remember him ? I do n't know him . " " He seemed to know you . " Anne-Marie stared at him , smiling . Again she shook her head . She had lovely fair skin , a small strong nose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He loved her , he was weak with love for her .... " It must have been a misunderstanding then , " he said . " But why are you so . . . strange ? " " Do I look strange ? " " Yes , you look as if you 're angry with me . " " No , no , I 'm not angry , no , " Jesse said , confused . He realized that he had tightened his grip on her arm and that he was frighteningher . He forced himself to relax . Relax . A few slow , deep breaths . He would be all right.  | " Who is this man again ? " Anne-Marie asked . " No one , nothing . It must have been a misunderstanding . " " He is n't a friend of yours , is he ? " " I do n't have any friends , " Jesse said . " Except you . " " What did he want with you ? " She kept looking at him , forcing him to look at her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . or maybe he was weak with hunger .. . everything was confused , jumbled in his head . I came only to congratulate you , Monk had said . Why did n't he believe that , why did n't he accept it ? A kind of wild elated anger kept tensing up his face , making his eyes narrow . He was frightening this girl . Obviouslyshe did not know Monk . " I wanted to see you this morning . I had to see you , " Jesse said . " You 're so beautiful .... You do love me ? " " You looked so angry for a minute , " Anne-Marie said . " You love me . . . ? " He stared into her face : he might have been staring over a precipice . There was that instant of danger , of terrible weightlessness . " Of course I love you , " she whispered . It was so easily said that he did not believe her . How could she love him ? Forgive him ? . . . But then he relented and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was already his wife . A few days later Trick gave Jesse a book of essays on biochemistry  --  heexplained that the publishers had sent him two copies and he had thought Jesse might like one . The book was sellingfor fifteen dollars . Jesse was tempted to refuse , but Trick was so sunny and unpushing that Jesse gave in ; maybe he had been mistaken about Trick . Now it seemed he was seeing Trick everywhere , at a distance , in the corridor of one building or another , and that Trick was friendly but not eager  --  content to wave at Jesse as he hurried along , having other people to talk to . Jesse saw him sometimes with Dr. Cady on the sidewalks around the Medical Center . Trick was often the center of a group , some boisterous gang a little loud from overwork , their laughter sounding hysterical ; he was taller than most of his friends , his fair hair a neutral , pallid gleam , his laughter cutting through theirs with that sudden , violent , lordly corrosiveness , as if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jester , a clown with license to say anything . And he did say anything in the company of students . Jesse overheard him joking about members of the medical school staff , about tumors , guts , brains , his own ingrown toenails , even about the medical experimentsperformed by Nazi doctors on human victims , the subject of a recent story in Life Magazine : " What I would n't give for such an opportunity ! " Trick would say , winking . " Imagine extra-large cats , cats with handles a man could actually grab hold of , not those cold furry little sons of bitches we have to work with in Americanlabs ! You must admit that Hitler had a certain style , a certain flair lacking in our bourgeois medical men . " And he would stretch his face , clowning and melancholy , daring them to take him seriously . One day he caught up with Jesse on the street and , out of nowhere , patted his slack stomach , which had begun to protrude in a small , soft , wavelike roll . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked hard enough , " he sighed merrily . " I miss the drama of the war . I wish it would return . Those concluding days did something to me , gave me a permanent taste for cheap suspense  --  this peacetimeliving is decadent , fattening . Even you could be worked harder , Jesse . " If he offended people , they gave no sign . Perhaps , like Jesse , they were puzzled by Trick and reluctant to judge him . When Trick was in the lecture hall or in the laboratory , he was usually serious ; the rest of the time , rarely . Was everything a joke , to be joked about ? Maybe . Trick 's large , genial face , his yodel of welcome and his stiff , rather formal handshake , even the deadpan remarks he made when passing out examination booklets made him extremely popular ; Jesse noticed other students imitating Trick . He wondered why he had always disliked the man . One morning Trick took over a lecture for Dr. Cady , who was out of town . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the research project he was heading , under Cady 's general supervision . He wore a suit and a tie , he spoke clearly , precisely , his forehead furrowed with the need to be absolutely correct . All around Jesse students sat hunched forward , taking rapid notes ; their desks creaked under the strain . Trick did not drift off into quaint metaphysical speculation , as Cady sometimes did , so the students had no rest , but were forced to write continually . Jesse was fascinated with what Trick had to say . He could hardly recognizeTrick in that dignified young man who stood at the lectern  --  how serious he was after all , how impressive a scientist ! Yes , Jesse thought , he was a man of exceptional quality . Half the amphitheater burst into spontaneous applause at the end of the lecture . Jesse and a few other students hurried down front to congratulate Trick . Afterward , still nervous and a little formal , Trick said to Jesse : " I 'm glad you could appreciate what I had to say . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They went out for coffee to a restaurant on State Street , and there Trick talked more about his research and his plans . Jesse , who was interested in clinical medicine , began to wonder if maybe research might be more exciting . He asked Trick questions and Trick replied seriously , respectfully . Yes , he did seem like another person . The formal clothing restrained him . After a while he relaxed and began to speak of the years he had put in himself , as a student , then an intern , then a resident . " People in my family have no idea what I am now . They think maybe I 've gone backwards . It seems to them I should have a practice of fifty thousand a year by now instead of grubbing along as I am . " Of his family he said little : his father was an " ordinary businessman in St. Paul , " his mother an " ordinary housewife in St. Paul . " Where did his genius come from then ? he asked ironically . ' Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ photographic memory and total recall . The cousin was a boy seventeen years old , but not mature enough to be trusted at a university ; Trick had the idea , though no one in the family exactly said this , that the boy was a little crazy . . . . Everyone else in his family seemed normal . His mother baked him brownies and mailed them every two or three weeks ; they arrived stale and broken , sometimes no more than crumbs , but he wrote back dutifully to thank her . Certain myths can not be broken . Hep226loved his parents because they were so decent , so normal . " We are all very Midwestern in my family , which means that we are decent , silent people . For all my talk , Jesse , you must understand that I am essentially a silent person . " But there was no danger of his perpetuatinghis family 's ordinary genes , he said , because he would never marry . He did not believe in the divinity of Christ , but he believed in Christ 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a horror of the body that was lyric and heavy , whimsical and grave : " We in medicine should go after the ultimate cure  --  the separation of the spirit from the flesh . Everything else is unsanitary nonsense . " Jesse laughed at this , bewildered . Yet at other times , when they talked of their work , Trick confessed to a sentimental weakness for fixing up things , making the parts work together perfectly , " especially in children  --  I could never work up a healthy hatred of any child . Which makes me think I 'll subside into being a country G.P. someday . " " Someone has to do that kind of work , " Jesse said . He was cautiouswith Trick because Trick so often joked ; but he did not seem to be joking now . So Jesse said , warming to the subject , " I know what you mean . I want to fix things up too . I have this dream , this bad dream , of my crossing a room to a patient who turns out to be dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because the patient is dead and beyond my ability to help him . . . . I wake up sweating . I wake up in a real terror . Because if they die , if they die ... then they have escaped to someplace where you ca n't follow them ; it 's as if they 've carried away with them to another dimension the secret of their disorder and ca n't be reached . Slicing the body open , pulling out the brains , wo n't really tell you why they died . " " No , that wo n't . That wo n't really tell you why they died , " Trick said . " I want to fix people up . Children and everyone . I 'd like to run a clinic , you know , a kind of welfare clinic but with good equipment , not a slum .... I want to save them all . " Trick listened closely . In spite of his habitual scowl of derision , he was really sympathetic ; Jesse sensed that . " I suppose I want to perform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want the miracles ordinary  --  I want to make miraculous things ordinary again . And I would like to do this impersonally . Out of sight . I do n't especially want to be Dr. Vogel , Dr. Vogel , I do n't want people grateful to me . I 'd like to be a presence that is invisp227ible , impersonal . I do n't want any personality involved  --  where t litre 's personality everything is confused  --  " Trick stared at him , smiling oddly . " I imagine myself this way , " Jesse said . " There will be my own family , my wife and children  --  " " Wife and children ? How many children ? " " Four or five . This family and me  --  together . We will understandone another . But the work I do , the patients I see , will be impersonal and without private history , just this abstract love for them  --  they will be a kind of family to me also , but abstract and impersonal  --  " And he was giddy with a sudden knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want to do good  --  " Trick was looking at him blankly . " You do n't think it 's possible ? " Jesse asked . " My opinion will have nothing to do with your future , " Trick said slowly . " Well , I want to do good , " Jesse said . " Otherwise it is n't worth it . Trick colored slightly , as if these words were too intimate for him . Jesse waited for Trick to ask about Anne-Marie , but he never mentioned her . He began to wonder if he had imagined Trick 's remarks about her . There were weeks of Trick 's joking , his silence , his melancholy , his gossip , his comic complaints  --  and still Jesse waited uneasily for him to mention Anne-Marie . Had Trick forgottenher ? One day , out walking with her , he believed he saw Trick in a crowd in front of the diagonal before the main library , and he was about to point Trick out to her when he thought better of it . . . . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jesse was working in a third-floor laboratory when Trick dropped by to see him . He must have climbed the stairs in a hurry , because he was struggling to get his breath . " Jesse , hello ! I have n't seen you all week , " he said . His face was pale and strained from the stairs . " I 've been working hard , " Jesse said . " How about you ? " " Oh , the same as always , the same . " IIe belled out his cheeks as if to make fun of his own breathlessness . He was really out of breath ; he was almost panting . " I 'm in perfect condition , as you can see . " " Nobody should run up those stairs , " Jesse said.  | " I did n't run . I came up carefully , one step at a time , " Trick laughed . Jesse watched him , concerned . But Trick waved him aside . He had a habit of dismissing personal questions or comments as if to show that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ available to anyone 's curiosity or sympathy . " Let me look at your work , " he said . He adjusted the eyepiece of the microscope . " Ah , very pretty ! Lovely little cobwebs you 've been growing . Do n't tell me what they are , that would spoil it . I like to think that such lovely things are cancer , maybe . . . people are so cruel about cancer , they are so grimly determined to wipe it out . . . . " He smiled at Jesse . " Cancerouscells have as much divinity in them as so-called normal cells . There 's too much prejudice against them . Did I ever tell you , Jesse , about my secret hopes for a career ? It 's a little late now , but I 'm thinking of switching to ob . work ; I 'd like to be a great gynecologist ; I 'd like to take loving , gentle smears from the bodies of women , and examine them like this , in the solitude of a laboratory . I would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep every secret . " Jesse recoiled from him a little . He forced himself to smile . Trick must have misunderstood the smile , for he stretched his narrow , dry lips in an instantaneous grin , as if a certain shock of sympathy had run between them . " If I could , I would impregnate them all  --  with my fingertips  --  I would be very gentle , I would be invisible . A certain young student , on his way to a brilliant career , told me once that he would like to be invisible  --  and I understood that desire at once ; I too would like to be invisible in this race of men , an instrument , a metallic model of an organ  --  for the real thing , the real organ , is apt to be disappointing , eh ? Disappointing to a woman ? Women are very demanding and very easily disap-pointed . " A winning smile , a flash of hectic joy  --  Trick seemed about to wink . Jesse 's face froze . " I could love them with my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Did I tell you I 've begun to write poems ? I 'll write one for you and Anne-Marie on the occasion of your wedding . " Jesse forced himself to laugh . " What , you 're writing poetry ? "  | " Talent is suffused in me , like mercury on a table top . Little beads and stems . Anyway , Jesse , one kind of elimination is as good as another . Do n't be a snob because you 're in love . Discharging in your beloved 's body , discharging in her brain with a few delicate words  --  which is more rewarding , after all ? I have a horror of germs . " Trick seemed better now ; he was breathing more normally . Boyish and cheerful , he tapped Jesse 's shoulder as if in farewell . " I wo n't take up any more of your time . I know how hard you work . What I came up here to tell you is that my parents will be in town this Saturday and they want to take me out to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've mentioned you to them  --  they take all my friendships very seriously , they want to see what kind of people I know  --  Maybe they 're afraid to be alone with me and want someoneelse to talk to ?  --  " " This Saturday ? I ca n't make it , " Jesse said quickly . " Just for dinner and part of the evening  --  " " I ca n't make it . " " Oh , yes . Anne-Marie , " Trick said flatly . " I said I 'd take her somewhere . . . to see her family . . . , " Jesse said , lying without skill . " Her sister ... " " All right . " " I 'm sorry , " Jesse said . " I 'd like to meet your parents . " " It 's all right , " Trick said . " I understand . " He turned to leave , then hesitated . His gaze scanned the laboratorytable top thoughtfully . He was much heavier than Jesse , more than two hundred pounds , but they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was muscular in the shoulders and arms ; once he had lost the excess weight he had gained , his body had grown hard , muscles of his chest and stomach were trim , tense , the calves of his legs poised as if to spring him forward . He would grip Trick by the throat , squeeze that fat neck and its chattering bones between his fingers . . . . But he only said carefully , " Is there something you want to tell me ? " Trick shook his head . " Nothing . " " You said you had known Anne-Marie but she denies it . She 's never heard of you . " They did not look at each other . At the far end of the lab a studentwas working , hunched over . He did not seem to be listening . His solitary , drab figure drew both Jesse 's and Trick 's attention.  | " You said you had known her . How well ? " Trick drew in his breath slowly . " Did you love her ? " Jesse asked . Trick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . She has never even heard of your name . She says  --  But what was it ? Did you love her ? " Trick made a motion to leave . " No , wait . Damn you , " Jesse said sharply . " What do you want to hear ? " Trick said , turning to face him . " You people in love ! " " Just answer my question . Please . " " You people in love always insist upon intrigue . . . . It makes me sick . " " Makes you sick , what do you mean ? " Jesse took a step forward . At the other end of the room that face turned toward them , startled by something in Jesse 's voice . Jesse felt his soul ache to flee into that other neutral , strange face , to be so distant and so uncomplicated . . . . " You were hinting something about her that night , something about Anne-Marie . I want to hear it , goddamn you , I want this straightened out . Were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Trick smiled ironically . " You do n't want to hear . " " Were you in love with her ? " Trick , at the door , screwed his face up and made a sudden , almost convulsive spitting gesture . " Love ! What the hell is love ? " he said . Jesse stared . " Good-by ! Good night ! " Trick cried . Ile waved good-by . Escaped . For a few minutes Jesse stood without moving , staring at the doorway where Trick had stood  --  he could see again that screwingupof the man 's face , the puckering of the lips . His heart pounded viciously . He kept seeing that face , that ugly face ; it was as if this spectacle had been predictable and yet he had insisted upon it , upon drawing it outWhat the hell is love ? That wrinkling of the face , the deepening lines about the mouth , the creases in the flesh . . . . Had he actually spat ? Jesse stared at the floor and saw nothing . No spittle . Yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to remember saliva sprayingthinly about his lips ... . He cleaned up and went back to his rooming house . Shameful , it was shameful to be so weak . So agitated . He hurried hack to the rooming house as if to hide . It was a three-story frame house , simply a rectangular box , with drab red-black siding that was supposed to look like brick . Jesse had lived there since September of 1949 . He had had to move out of his basement room  --  which was so damp he was always catching colds anyway  --  because his landlady had decided to rent it to two students , in that way doubling the rent . Jesse had found this room after days of searching , had moved all his things over in an angry , desperate burst of energy , without any help , up to a cramped room on the top floor , with a ceiling that peaked in the middle and sloped cruelly on the sides so that he could really stand up straight only in the middle of the room . But what did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact that he would now be on the top floor of a decent house and not in a damp basement ? In spite of the noisiness of the house , he had been very happy up in that room . His landlady , Mrs. Spewak , was in her late thirties , querulous and attractive in a thin , restless way , her eyebrows plucked too severely , as if she had copied them on faith from a movie magazine . Her clothes were never quite right  --  she wore low-cut silky blouses with ordinary cotton skirts or slacks and very tight synthetic sweaters , sleeveless , tucked into the wide plastic belts that emphasizedher narrow waist ; her skirts were apt to be flowery and buoyant , with petticoats underneath them in the style of the day , or they were too tight , showing the ridges of her underwear and the ends of her tucked-in blouses strained against her flesh . She had a busy , gypsy-like manner that Jesse liked . He did like her , in spite of her chatter and complaints and the demands she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name as he hurried upstairs , or rapping on his door , wanting to enlist him on her side against the other tenants , who , Jesse had to admit , were pigs . Most of them were pigs . Mrs. Spewak and her daughter lived in the rear , lower part of the house . Jesse caught glimpses of their quarters sometimesfrom the kitchen . The living room was not really a personalizedfamily room , but rather a dingy , sooty space , furnished with a single leather couch that showed hundreds of cracks and some chairs and tables that might have been bought at a rummage sale , all mismatched and ungainly . A single braided rug had been placed in the middle of the floor , but it was far too small for the size of the room . The other students joked about this place , especially about the new wallpaper Mrs. Spewak was so proud of  --  all towers and castles and spires of silver , outlined sharply in black like cartoondrawings , looking European and medieval . Jesse was depressed by this room , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . The second and third floors of the house had been divided into six on the second floor and three on the third , and though Jesse lived so far up he was never confident that he would be left alone . The other students wandered around , lazily anxious for conversation , for distractions , hopeful of borrowing cigarettes or money , sometimes sitting on the edge of Jesse 's bed though he had nothing to say to them and was clearly working . They were all younger than he . They came in late , drunk , and made a lot of noise on the stairs and in the bathroom . Even the landlady 's daughter wandered around during the day , though this part of the house was forbidden to her . She sometimes turned up in Jesse 's room when he returned unexpected , snooping around .... Jesse suspected her mother of snooping too , though no one had actually caught her . When he came home from the laboratory that day Mrs. Spewak was on the second-floor landing . Her face was bony and witchlike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mop and pail and looked very pleased , Jesse thought , at being discovered so hard at work . " Hey , you knocking off work early today ? " she said . " Something came up , " Jesse muttered . " If you 'd come five minutes ago I could of showed you something . Real nice surprise in the john up on your floor . It 's that Simon Brodsky , I bet  --  " Jesse tried to brush by her politely . " Eh , you would n't believe the pigs that live here . Did their mothers bring them up to be pigs ? " Jesse hurried up to his room , closed the door , stood for a few moments with his back against the door and his heart pounding.  |p233Pigs  . . . . Yes , they were pigs . His skin crawled with the realization of the foulness that was everywhere around him , the deceit , the shame , the hopeless wasting-away of flesh .... He wanted to be sick to his stomach . But there was no time for that now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bathroom Mrs. Spewak would come up , hearing everything , sniffing out everything , and she would rap on the door to ask what was wrong . I am going to lose Anne-Marie , Jesse thought in a panic . For an instant he seemed to confuse Mrs. Spewak and Anne-Marie . Both , women : a certain kind of woman . They knew all his needs simply by looking at him . Good at guessing , at hunches , kindly and secretive behind their pretty faces ... . Jesse went to the bathroom after all and latched the door behind him . Today was cleaning day and the room smelled of harsh soap . A woman had been in here cleaning . Scouring . The mop , the red plastic pail of soapy , dirty water , the droplets of water-softened scum falling from the mop . . . . Jesse felt the vague desire to be sick . To be sick and get it over with . Discharging . . . . He stood shakily at the small sink , staring at his face . A face filled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were throbbing with a knowledge that was not Jesse 's own knowledge , but the knowledge of his flesh , his species . Why could n't he trust it ? I am going to lose her and lose everything , he thought . Weakly , he closed his eyes upon his own familiar face  --  which he always did his best to assess generously , because he had nothing else , no other face to rely upon  --  and he summoned up Anne-Marie 's womanly , pretty face and the sweet warm mass of her body . Surges of power  --  the center of her being , a socket of pure power that would suck him into it and charge him with its strength  --  asking nothing of him but the surrenderand collapse of all his bones , the blacking-out of his consciousness . Yes , he would come to her . He was wild with desire for her . He remembered how she had looked that morning in the hospital , coming through the swinging doors from the stairway , staring at him , surprised . . . . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door . " Jesse ? " It was Mrs. Spewak . He thought wildly of opening the door and telling her to leave him alone . Leave me alone ! He would grab her arm and pull her into the bathroom , pull the scarf from her head so that he could finger the tight , ugly little pincurls , the hairpins and the small wire-like curls fastened flat to her head ; he would pull her dress open , yank it down from her shoulders . . . . " Hey , Jesse , you all right ? " " I 'm all right , " he said , his eyes closed . " You sure ? Not sick , are you ? " " No . " She waited a few seconds , her hand still on the doorknob . Jesse was alarmed at the desire he felt , which was angry and abstract , ripe as something teased beyond its natural growth . He cleared his throat . " I 'm all right , Mrs. Spewak . Everything is all right . " " You looked pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll give you some stew . It 'll fix you up fine . " Jesse opened the door . He brushed his hair back from his forehead with both hands in a flicking gesture , as if to suggest to her that he had only been combing his hair in here . . . . " Everything is fine , " he said , brushing past her . If only she would n't touch him ! But the hall was narrow and he could not avoid brushing against her . She followed after him . Talking about stew , beef stew , whyIII did n't he come downstairs and let her heat it up for him ? why did n't he relax ? It was no wonder he 'd caught cold that winter , the way he was always running up and down the stairs . . . not eating right .... li Jesse escaped and telephoned Anne-Marie from the drugstore . The phone rang five , six , seven times ; then her mother answered . Jesse hung up . He was going to see her at seven that evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frantic , precarious . If someone bumped into him in this store , if a woman bumped into him , he felt that he would go crazy , he might do something crazy . . . . He wandered through the drugstore , not really looking at anything , and a few minutes later dialed Anne-Marie 's number again . Again her mother answered , suspiciously , and again he hung up . He knew she was not home and yet he thought frantically that somehow she might answer , she might answer the telephone . . . . He walked across town to her house . He must have looked anxious or in a hurry , because people glanced at him as he passed . He felt himself careening across the miles of pavement , a tall body , a young man with a precise destination , a precise fate , his eyes a little glassy with the certainty of this fate  --  where was she , AnneMarie , that young woman he did not exactly trust ? Where was shep235at this moment , why was n't she available to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not stand it , his separation from her . She was looking at people who were strangers to him , at this moment . She was smiling . Speaking . She maneuvered herself quite intimately and ordinarily with people Jesse did not know . It was awful , it would drive him crazy . . . . He loved her and it seemed to him that his love , which was so miserable , should be repaid at once . AnneMarieshould be with him right now . After they were married she would always be with him , or available to him instantly ; no separation ; no mystery . He would know everything she did , everyone she spoke with ; she would lie sweetly in his arms every night ; and the two of them , husband and wife , would press their faces together , their mouths and cheeks , loving , sleepbound , their energies flowing freely like warm water back and forth as if through the same veins .... He was two hours early when he got to her house , and he did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nervously down the street . He felt a little faint . He could not stand still , his body craved Anne-Marie so angrily ; he began to walk , not paying much attention to what he was doing , into the gray warm sluttish air of the street . How to wait out those two hours ! Now and then he felt a wave of faintness . Maybe he had forgotten to eat . Maybe he should eat . But his stomach cringed at the thought . . . . Look at that man on the sidewalk ahead , strained and heaving with fat ! Jesse stared . Fat , fat , a fat man , a fat face and body , even the feet big , swollen , a human being bursting with fat creamy flesh . Jesse could barely keep the disgust from showing on his face . But this man was sick . Fat people were sick . When he was a doctor he would have to understand : the sick needed help in their sickness , not hatred and not affection . You did n't love them in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You were swift and clean and detached . . . . The fat man was gone and Jesse found himself thinking of Anne-Marie in the man 's place : his own anger , worry , disapproval focused upon her . Sick in the hospital , Jesse had understood the isolation of the patients , their exclusion from the bustle and chatter and the nurses ' perpetual giggling out in the corridors , especially late at night , the banging of mysterious metal things and the squeaking wheels of carts , and those girls , those girls with their whispers and muted laughter . . . . One of them had turned out to be Anne-Marie . A fresh , stunning face , hair in loose rich waves , girlish and breathless : Anne-Marie . He had fallen in love with her despite his general nervous irritation with nurses . Why were they always making so much noise ? But he had fallen in love with her . She was melodic , her voice had a lilting musical insincerity about it that charmed him ; yet she turned out to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , her face would go soft , as if his words entered her hearing and transformed her , as if his nearness had the magical power of transforming her into the woman he wanted , a wife who would be a match for him . She nodded slowly . Slowly . She was always agreeing with him . But then she would reply with an odd question that showed she had n't quite understood or had n't been listening closely ; or she would smile archly and switch to another subject , as she had after they had attended a symposium on communityhealth in Detroit  --  having been subjected to three hours of speeches , harangues , statistics , graphs , charts , diagrams , blueprints , slides , all of them pointing to the impoverished condition of public health resources for the poor , having seen a film of crowded wards and aged , vacuous faces , the senile and the mad and the desperately sick ; having heard the speakers ' flat pessimistic predictionsfor the future  --  having sat next to Jesse through all that horror , Anne-Marie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at once , whispering into his ear : " Are you hungry , Jesse ? You must be starving after all this ! " But though he recalled this now , he felt all the more desperate to see her . So many little vexations . Little disappointments . He had to get hold of her , he had to make certain of her . He would frame her face in his hands , he would press his mouth against hers , he would embrace her wildly . . . . Up ahead he saw a couple approachingand for a moment , shocked , he thought the girl was AnneMarie . But no , it was a stranger , a girl dressed in white  --  a white dress that was not a uniform . Shakily , Jesse went back to AnneMarie'sstreet and waited . When she finally came , getting off a bus at the corner , he again saw the surprise and the faint fear in her when she noticed him . " Jesse . . . ? " she said , wondering . He hurried to her and took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other , smiling . Jesse saw that her face was not quite ready for him  --  there was a coarse ,  |p237greasy  cast to her forehead and her hair was wind-blown . But she was still very beautiful . " Do n't bother going in the house . Let 's leave here . Let 's go for a walk , " Jesse said . " I  --  I want to change my clothes  --  " " No , do n't bother , you look beautiful . You look lovely , " Jesse said . She seemed evasive beneath her smiling surprise . He could sense her thinking rapidly . Maybe she did not love him , he thought angrily , maybe she wanted to marry him only because he was going to be a doctor . All these nurses , these clever little girls , hoped to marry doctors . . . . But why was he thinking such things ? He loved her . He loved her very much . He liked her being a nurse , he felt the rightness of their marriage . Everything was right . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Street , to the arboretum . It was one of their frequent walks . Jesse could not pay attention to AnneMarie'schatter ; he thought only of embracing her , of making love to her . When they were in the arboretum , on one of the deserted paths , he embraced her and she slid her arms about him tightly . She was so sweet , so light in his arms .... His desire for her was painful . Then she squirmed away . She took his hand and walked beside him , and he could sense her separateness , her isolation from him . What was she thinking ? Jesse led her down a slope , so steep that they had to dig their heels into the earth . They were alone now . Jesse put his arms around her again . He could not stop mauling her , pressing himself against her . Everything about her seemed to him vital and mysterious , filmy with the gauze-like confusion of his closed eyes , the rubbing of their faces together , the warm flesh of her back through the uniform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the sense of her tight , coiipressed little body ... . He was whispering something to her . He loved her . Loved her . He needed her . An image flashed into his mind : that girl on the street in the white dress , whom he mistaken for Anne-Marie . A girl he might make love to , like this . Another image : Mrs. Spewak on the other side of the bathroom door , calling him . Taunting him . She was an attractive woman ; she threw herself around the house halfdressedsometimes ; she knew exactly what she was doing . . . and why was she always brushing against him or tugging at his arm , teasing him ? He remembered Trick in the laboratory doorway . Trick backing away . That look on his face . The bitter drawing-up of his lips , the contemptuous scowl . Love ! What the hell is love ? And Mrs. Spewak had made a bitter face too , though her skin was exhilarated with the energy of her anger : Pigs . Jesse felt like sobbing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not control himself . She was whispering , " Jesse ? Jesse ? " They lay down . Anne-Marie said , " Jesse , I love you , I love you , but I ca n't get used to you . . . all this emotion . . . . You 're happy with me and then , when we meet again , you 're angry . . . . I do n't understand you . " He kissed her wildly , happily . " I 'm not angry with you . I 'm not angry , " he said . She had such a pretty face  --  why could n't he trust it ? Maybe he did not trust prettiness . Her skin was fair and smooth , her hair gleaming , always clean , lovingly tended . . . she was always tending herself , checking herself in mirrors . . . . " I 'm afraid of you , " she whispered . " Jesse , please do n't hurt me .... " " I love you . Do n't be afraid , " he said . He could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lain in each other 's arms out here , far from the wide paths and from other people , and Jesse had felt at those times a small prickling sensation of being spied upon , though no one ever watched anyone else out here . . . and now he experienced the same sensation but it seemed to provoke him further , to increase his desire . . . the certaintythat someone must be watching , that Trick himself was somehow staring sardonically at the two of them , his lips prepared to utter a contemptuous word : Pigs . . . . It was possible that Trick had been Anne-Marie 's lover , that he had known her when she was a nursing student years ago . It was possible that she had lied about that and about other things . He could not believe her . " Do n't be afraid , I love you , I love you , " Jesse said in anguish as the poison built up in him , a sharp rhythmic pain . They had made love only a few times before , gently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into her , with a sudden violence that made her cry out . Jesse 's mind seemed to bounce everywhere , from one part of the hill to another , stricken with the blind agitation of this momentShe wept in surprise , clinging to him . " I love you ... , " he said , as if this explained everything . But now ,  |p239with  his face pressed against her hair , his eyeballs numb , as if scorched , he felt the beginning of a long wavering sigh of despair . And he knew that he did not love her , not any longer . He did not believe that Trick had been her lover , and yet it was as if it had happened  --  as if he had witnessed it . Trick , curious and cynical in this beautiful girl 's arms , in the silence of this place , in the damp grass . Trick screwing up his face and spitting . Pronouncing judgmentupon her . Trick 's wise , monkish face ... . No , he could not love her after this , though he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was not possible for him to love her but he would marry her as he had promised . One day in late May , Jesse was behind the wheel of his landlady'scar , parked in front of a grocery store in which Mrs. Spewak was shopping . The car was an old Ford with a splotched windshield and soiled , frayed seat covers . A small St. Christopher medal , of a yellowish plastic meant to look like ivory , was attached by a suction cup to the dashboard ; in the back seat , the eight-year-old Carla sat , jarring Jesse 's seat with her knees , chattering at him in her highpitched , exasperated voice . Something about her mother  --  her mother 's injustice to her . Carla had the frank , wistful , torturous expression of a dwarfed adult but the relentlessness of a child , continuallycircling the same topic : " I hate her . I hate her . " " No , you do n't hate her , " Jesse said sternly . But he had his eye on a couple approaching the car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but somehow out of place here  --  unexpectedhere  --  that careful , fastidious walk , the way he moved his hands in slow , artificial , restrained gestures  --  as if explaining something that must be visualized precisely . Jesse recognized Professor Cady . It was Cady . And the woman was probably his wife : she wore a dark green suit , the jacket a little mannish , plain , loose as a maternity outfit , giving her a sturdy , shapeless appearance . Jesse saw that her legs were quite slender , though , and probably inside that unflattering suit she was slender , lithe , appealing . Cady had evidently married a woman many years younger than himself . Jesse did not know if he approved of this or not . He stared at them , hoping they would not notice him  --  Cady was no taller than the woman , his near-white hair clipped short and clean about his handsomeskull , his coat a dark khaki , plain and correct as a uniform . He looked British . Jesse had always supposed that his clothes were expensive ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's voice , by a certain trick , called attention to itself  --  the lifting of words at the conclusion of a sentence , a subtle accenting of the next-to-last words , so that he seemed about to call his listeners to account . They were alerted , a little intimidated by him . His expression was usually neutral and undramatic . His eyes were shrewd but rather small and closely-set . Were they gray , some near-neutral color ? Jesse wondered if the man 's small , excellent white teeth could really be his own . Jesse drew in his breath as he watched Cady and the woman approach , the two of them so obviously together , united . They were talking earnestly about something that united them . Cady 's gracefulhands , describing odd little circles and boxes in the air , united them with their seriousness and their precision . What were they saying ? Cady had married an attractive young woman . Jesse stared critically at her and saw that her face was serious and intelligent , the pale lips curved to a tentative smile as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiled . Jesse wondered what they were talking about . What did married people talk about ? Suddenly he wondered what it might be like to he that man , that distinguished man  --  Cady had been a colleague of Walter Cannon 's at Harvard , years ago , he had been awarded a Nobel Prize along with two other men and certainly at Michigan he was highly respected , almost idolized by certain students  --  Jesse 's mind raced with the thought of meeting Cady now , face to face on the sidewalk . Why not ? There he is . There . Here you are , sitting here . Do n't let him get away . They had passed the car . Jesse 's heart beat with a heavy , sullen envy of their intimacy , that gray-haired man and his young wife , the two of them perfect together . . . ennobled ... .  |p241He  mumbled something to Carla and got out of the car . " Dr. Cady ! " he called out . Cady and the woman turned . Jesse hurried up to them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would he say ?  --  but he was encouraged by Cady 's polite , alert smile . I t was the public smile of the lectures , generous and impersonal but unthreatening . " I just wanted to say hello , Dr. Cady . I wanted to tell you how much I 've liked  --  I 've learned  --  I took your neurochemistrycourse this year  --  " Cady smiled at him. " it 's good of you to say so , " he said , extending his hand . " What is your name ? " " Jesse Vogel .... " " Ah , Jesse Vogel , I think I remember that name .... " This was probably not true and he did not stress the point ; he simply shook Jesse 's hand firmly and released it . He was a fairly short man , about five feet six . " Mr. Vogel , this is my daughter Helene ; she 's been kind enough to stay with me for the past few weeks , taking care of me . Jesse and the young woman nodded shyly . Jesse saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been Cady 's wife ; obviouslyshe was his daughter . The outfit she wore was not a maternity suit , just a suit that was a little too large for her . " Do you like Ann Arbor ? " Jesse asked her . He looked her full in the face and gave no sign of his own nervousness . She replied , and Cady began to speak again , chatting about Ann Arbor , which was so much more leisurelythan Cambridge , so much more pleasant in certain ways . He spoke of a chamber-music recital he and his daughter had heard the evening before , and though Jesse knew nothing about it he nodded briskly , as though he too had attended . His smile was strained but ambitious , big enough for both Cady and his daughter . How easy it had been to shake Cady 's hand ! Cady seemed to have no idea of his own importance . He spoke to Jesse as casually as if Jesse were a friend of his or an equal at the university . " Yes , we are both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're impatient to be back home .... Helene does n't know anyone here , of course . " Cady had a small man 's love of precision , his words were neat and clipped and self-conscious , as if to call attention to some subtlety in his meaning . Jesse felt a surge of emotion  --  affection  --  and recalled how readily , how cheerfully , Cady had shaken hands with him . He had done it . He had done it . Always , all year , he had admired this man , knowing enough to be able to assess Cady 's knowledge and his undramatic recitation of dramatic material , his patience , his ability to anticipate questions in the sleepy , shadowy heads of his students in that big amphitheater . He had always had the sense , too , that Cady was somehow aware of him . Standing in front of Cady and his daughter , Jesse felt that his height was a burden  --  he was so much taller than either of them . Did he appear overgrown and clumsy in their eyes ? And he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  a frayed shirt with its sleeves rolled up , the collar not very clean , soiled cotton trousers , shoes without socks . He had not even shaved that morning . Time for them all to part . Jesse thanked Cady for the course and Cady accepted this graciously . " I 'm sorry to bother you , " Jesse apologized , backing off . It had all gone well . Cady was obviously flattered , and the girl was proud of her father , casting a cool , demure sideways glance at him , a wifely glance . Jesse said good-by and turned to leave . His heart was pounding . He returned to the car just as Mrs. Spewak was leaving the store . What good luck that she had not come out while he had been talking with the Cadys . . . . " God , Jesse , it cost me twenty-five dollars in there . The stuff is just inside the door there , can you get it ? It 's too heavy for me . God , I feel sick . " She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too tight for her small , sharp breasts . " Sure , I 'll get it . I 'll get it , " Jesse said quickly . He no longer saw Anne-Marie . They had argued over something  --  her accusation of his not loving her  --  and had decided to break their engagement . It had been unofficial anyway . Unofficial . It did n't count , Anne-Marie had said bitterly . With Anne-Marie out of his life , Jesse found himself with Mrs. Spewak more and more . It happened . Inertia , a vague desire to please , a vague sense of guilt : her sighs , her headaches , her backaches , her continual amazementat the troubles a woman had to face . And that daughter ! Carla was not really a child of superior intelligence , Jesse thought , but she had a quick , crippling mind , a premature cynicism that sometimes passed for intelligence . She was very thin in the chest , her arms and legs were so small that Jesse could easily have circledp243them with his thumb and forefinger . She had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would make her more interesting to Jesse because he was going to be a doctor  --  she was allergic to dust and pollen and food and fur and certain mixtures of sunlight and humidity ; she was feverish , restless , she rarely smiled , she did a lot of kicking and hanging onto her mother or Jesse , clamoringfor attention . But when she received attention she became quickly embarrassed and bored . She hated to be looked at . She would put her fingers over her eyes as if to hide . . . . When Mrs. Spewak went out , which was often , Jesse took care of Carla . " Where is my mother ? Where did she go ? " Carla would demand . When Jesse told her , she would n't believe it . Trick did n't believe it either . He was probably right : Jesse 's landlady was just using him . Taking advantage of his kindness . She was an ignorant , lazy woman and there was something not quite clear about her life , but she had not exactly hurt Jesse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much . Jesse was inclined to defend her . She had evidently been married at one time but her husband had left her or she had kicked him out ; maybe she was officially divorced , maybe not ; she spoke of herself as Catholic , though she did not often go to Mass . When she asked favors of Jesse she spoke in a swift , apologetic voice , staring fixedly at him so that Jesse did not have the heart to turn her down . " She wants to eat you up , kid , " Trick laughed . But the domestic squabbles , in which Jesse was forced to join , the routine of Saturday shopping and the putting away of groceries in the kitchen , his care of the garbage cans , his beating the rugs for her , quieted the racing of his brain that sometimes frightened him . He was so weak , really . . . . In spite of what people thought , he was so weak , he dared not be alone too much , dared not allow himself to think much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grateful for the duties of household life , even the dull , demanding voices of Mrs. Spewak and Carla . " I do n't mind helping her out , " Jesse said to Trick . " She just wants to use you . " " What do you mean , use me ? I do n't mind . " " Does she offer to pay you ? " " She does n't have any money . " " She could take it off your rent . She could do something for you . "  | " She couldn t afford that . " " Jesse , Jesse !  --  you 're so eager to give yourself away ! " They were friends now , Jesse and Trick . Somehow they had become friends . Jesse did not know whether to resent Trick 's interestin him or to be grateful that someone seemed to care about him . He had the idea that other students envied him his friendship with Trick  --  Dr. Monk  --  and so he did not mind when Trick showed up half an hour early to have coffee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dropped in on Jesse at night , complaining that he was unable to sleep . " We insomniacs share a certain mystique , " Trick said . They never spoke of Anne-Marie . Jesse would have liked to explain to Trick that he had fallen out of love with her entirely . It was over . It was nearly forgotten . He did not hate Trick . Trick really had nothing to do with it  --  Jesse had just stopped loving her , that was all . And if he had hated Trick , even a little , it was forgotten along with his love for Anne-Marie . ... Trick was like an older brother , a fretful older relative . He was critical about Jesse 's habits : " It 's a kind of mania , the way you force yourself to work . But as long as you function so well , that 's the only test , the only test of health . " He seemed to Jesse a superior man , an exceptional man . What had appeared to be dangerous in him was really only his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sometimes he goaded Jesse gently , with a curious bright look to his face . " How is your landlady this week ? Is she still after you ? " " You exaggerate things , " Jesse said . " She has a lecherous eye , I 'm sure of it . She has a certain moist , downy look , even for her age . . . and she is n't so old really . Are you sure you 're not her lover and you do n't want to tell me about it ? " " I 'm not anyone 's lover , " Jesse said . Trick smiled . " There was this friend of my grandfather 's in Minneapolis , a wealthy old man , who had his own zoo built for him  --  no , not a zoo , an animal sanctuary , a private jungle  --  and he appropriated also a number of wives in succession , the wives getting younger as he got older . One of the wives looked like your Mrs. Spewak , though better-looking . I think he acquired her along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or that was part of the stunt in the carnival she traveled with . She wore a riding outfit aroundp245the place , and boots that came up to her thighs , and she carried a little whip with a velvet handle . Ah , it was magnificent to see her striding around ! The old man had a huge ugly house , like a warehousemade of brick . There were rooms in his house he had never seen . And this woman , though she stood to lose a few million dollarsand to be tossed back into the carnival again , she would drive out through the jungle and let herself out the gate and drive along the highways  --  because there were highways , normal highways , this was an ordinary part of the world  --  to gas stations and country stores and pick up kids there , I mean kids in their twenties ; she was a kind of legend in the county . . . . She never bothered me , though . She never even glanced at me . Maybe that was because there is nothing lionlike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Jesse asked , amazed . " She ran away and he divorced her eventually . He married a twenty-year-old girl . " " Did he really have lions there  --  in the United States ? " " He had lions , eagles , monkeys  --  lots of monkeys and chimpanzeesand even some apes  --  and parrots and large hogs from the Everglades  --  andall these women , these wives . " " You have known freakish people , " Jesse said slowly . Later , he wondered if Trick 's stories were true : they always began innocently enough , always connected to Trick through a relative or friend , and then they branched out , blossomed out , to touch upon worlds Jesse did not understand . He wanted to believe in the ordinary , in the normal . His mind was slow to admit the bizarre . " Yes , freakish people are drawn to me , " Trick said with a grin . Close up , his face was mottled and inconsistent , though he was not an ugly man . But he had this uneven , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been applied to it in layers that had begun to smudge and run . Out of this mixture of tones  --  lardv flesh , rosy flesh , sallow flesh  --  his small eyes peered with a cheerfulness that was exaggerated at times , out of proportion to its object , as if Trick saw through the ordinary to another dimension invisible to his listeners . There was something oversized and godly about him , a debased godliness , though , as if he were the son of a god and were failing at his inheritance . " I get a kick out of strange people . I would like to be a collector . Maybe I 'll become a county pathologist and do autopsies for some little town . . . . I would be more gentle with the dead than with the livingbecause , of course , you do n't get any hypocrisy from the dead .... " Jesse laughed uneasily . He wondered if he were one of the freaks who were drawn to Trick . He was thinking now , almost constantly , about Dr. Cady and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He felt a peculiar agitation , almost a sense of despair , to think that the year was coming to an end  --  his years as a medical student were coming to an end  --  and yet something was missing . Trick asked him what was wrong : why was he so quiet ? But he said nothing ; he could not have explained . He was graduating at the top of his class , and this was a completion of all his plans , his most feverish , improbable plans , and yet something was missing ; something had been lost . It was not Anne-Marie . He had stopped loving her and now even the memory of his love , his anguish , was baffling to him . It did not seem believablethat he had loved her so much . At times he could not even recall her face except to remember its bright , impersonal healthy beauty that might have belonged to any girl . His loss was centered somehow upon Cady . He sat in the front row of the amphitheater staring at the man 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible for a young man to grow into that particular man , to mature into Benjamin Cady . The school year was coming to an end , and its hectic melancholy was somehow focused upon Cady 's face . How to become that man without debasing himself ? One afternoon he took Carla to a movie while Mrs. Spewak went to the dentist , " to the dentist , " she said , and Jesse chose to believe her , and during the movie Jesse was inspired by the energy of the screen  --  giant cowboys and cattle thundering back and forth  --  and decided he would not let the year end so weakly . He would not let the Cadys escape him . He looked for their name in the telephone book , could n't find it , and telephoned the medical school office to ask for Cady 's address . He was the son of a friend from Harvard , he said . Jesse , who never lied , lied now flamboyantly and happily , feeling himself safe in the telephone booth at the rear of the nearly deserted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the darkness of a movie house  --  flashing out of the confused splotches of color and light that made up the screen 's images , like the underside of a dream forcing its way to the surface of the mind.  |p247After  the movie was over he took Carla for a walk . She liked to walk through the university . Jesse took her out Washtenaw for several blocks to the apartment building where Cady lived . Carla was in a good mood ; she had enjoyed the movie . She looked so small , so docile , that she could have been Jesse 's own daughter . In spite of her thin , strained face he was proud of being with her : someone might mistake him for her father . A father of a child . A father . Carla chattered about the movie , but Jesse remembered only looming men , expressionless men , vast colored skies and horizons , the promise of eternal desert , mountains that looked like perfunctorylimitations of the earth , the earth as it is imagined , needing an end . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monumental thud of stampeding cattle . Forces pounding in one direction and then back in the other . Back and forth . A tornado of the mind . A spiral dipping out of the sky . It was the Old Testament , all that activity ! And he was absurdly , abruptly , grateful for the movies , which he saw so rarely , for their progress in patches and spurts , not as a coherent story but as the jagged bits of a story that never quite added itself up to anything believable . Years ago , his freshman English instructor at the university had told him there was something odd about his understanding of literature  --  he was unable to follow a plot . He was unable to see the careful evolution of a story . The necessary pattern , the rhythm that demanded completion , the internal heat , the gravity that forced everything to a suitable conclusion . . . what did all these things mean ? He had not understood , though he had tried . But in the end he did not know what a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what people thought were stories were fragments from shattered wholes , the patterns , the brain waves , of a certain man at a certain time in his life , the record of his controlled and uncontrolled inner life : therefore all writing was autobiography , was n't it ? His instructor , an earnest young New Yorker , had tried to explain what was wrong with Jesse 's ideas . Or his temperament , maybe ; he did n't have a " literary temperament . " But Jesse still believed that all writing was factual and true , as part of a shattered whole that could not be put back together again but must be experienced only in parts , and yet was not " believable " in the way his medical texts were believable . You lived it but you could not believe it.  | He was struck by a sense of shyness as he entered the Cadys ' apartment building . It was fairly small , four stories high , made of stone that was weathered and stained , covered partly with ivy , with the appearance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a still , moist air that had the quality of secrecy , sternness ; an elevator with an elaborate iron grillwork that put Jesse dizzily in mind of a fortress . There was a stern , secretive spirit here and a variety of styles  --  the curlicues of the grillwork , brass knobs , small heraldic beasts at the molding , nearly lost in shadow and dust , an aged but very respectable wallpaper that showed silvery leaflife designs , absolutely flat , motionless , unlike the turbulent screen of the movie house Jesse had just been in . Carla tugged at his arm and whined about going home  --  was n't it time to go home ? What were they doing here ? The Cadys ' apartment was on the first floor , so he did not have to take the elevator . Carla would probably have refused to get into it . He found the door without any trouble , bent to spruce up Carla , hid his own nervousness . He rang the doorbell and Cady 's daughter answered the door almost immediately . It happened so quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Cady  --  ? " " He is n't home right now . " " Oh . . . he is n't home ? " She did not reply , looking from him to Carla and back again . " When do you think he 'll be home ? " " I do n't know . " Jesse smiled nervously . " I wanted to say good-by before he left . . . . I wanted . . . this is a little friend of mine , Carla Spewak . You probably do n't remember me . . . my name is Jesse Vogel .... " She nodded , but so quickly and vaguely that Jesse could not tell if she had remembered . His face went hot with disappointment . " Yes , I 'll tell Father you stopped by . " " I 'm sorry to disturb you . " " It 's all right . " " Was I disturbing you . . . ? Are you busy ? I wonder if I could talk to you for a minute , " Jesse said . She hesitated . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I do n't want to take up your time , but I 'd like to talk to you for a minute , " Jesse said . Cady 's daughter did not quite meet his eye . The skin of her foreheadseemed to tighten , as if with dread or expectation ; Jesse found himself staring at the dead-white part in the center of her head . Her black hair had been brushed back on either side of this part , starkly and smoothly , but in front of her ears there were filmy tendrils of hair , not thick enough to be curls . Her face was pale and clear  --  no make-up , no lipstick . A face denuded of guile , no tricks there , no bright false surges of enthusiasm of the kind he got from other girls and that had disturbed him so in Anne-Marie . He wanted only the truth from women . He wanted their true faces . He did not care about beauty , Jesse told himself as he stared at this young woman , who was not beautiful but who seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and possessed instead that stern , doubtful face ... . She smiled suddenly . A courteous smile , exactly like her father 's . " Yes , please come in . Father will probably be home soon . " She led them inside and Jesse was pleased with the sparseness , cleanness  --  furniture that was well-worn , an oval table with a scalloped tableclothdraped over it , a gleaming white bowl that was empty of fruit or decoration , lamps that looked squat and old-fashioned and hunched , shades that were a little yellowed . His eye jumped at once to a photograph in a dark metal frame , set on a table  --  he saw Cady in a group of men , standing in what appeared to be a garden . He bent to look at it . Stockholm , 1947 . " Your father  --  Dr. Cadv  --  that was when he won the Nobel Prize ? " Jesse stammered . He felt giddy with the fact of being here , standing here . Helene Cadv seemed about to say something , then hesitated . Perhapsshe sensed Jesse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the side , so that he saw her dark , still eyes across the slender side of her cheek , and something moved in him : he would love this woman . Later , he would recall Carla Spewak as if she had been their first daughter . Their most basic and helpless child , a complaining , sickly , precociously troubled little girl , whose eves had begun to water in the first five minutes of their visit  --  set off by a frayed black fur thrown across one of the sofas . So much would come of this visit that it was necessary to believe a great deal had gone into it  --  more than his straying desires , ripened by the late , warm spring , or his vexing recollection of Anne-Marie , Anne-Marie 's body , or the odd half-recalled tale of Trick 's about a woman in a riding outfit who carried a small velvet-handled whip , searching for lovers along a Minnesota highway . What could he bring to Helene , directly to her , unflinching and unashamed , except the keenness of his respect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , listening body ? A clear , sun-splotched day . The mist of early morning had burned off , the sky was enormous , they were driving along a country road that dipped and seemed to bounce around curves , as if any surprise might be waiting for them . The road was empty all the way . Jesse sat between Trick and Helene , his hand clasped around Helene 's , and beyond their casual conversation  --  Trick was talking about his plans for next year , his internship at Massachusetts General , where he would study with Francis Ehrlich in psychiatric medicine  --  Jesse felt the pull of the distance , the civilized Michigan hills . Running right up to the road was a field of new corn , hardly a foot high . Air swam through it , silent ripples ; it looked as if it were being stroked by an invisible hand . Jesse felt caressed by that same wind , able to pay only slight attention to Trick 's voice . His fingers moved restlessly over the ring on Helene 's finger . He had borrowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ring  --  a ring with a small diamond , a plain band and setting . He was proud of it . He was proud of Helene 's obvious happiness in wearing it . His eye involuntarily always sought out this ring on her finger , anxious to see if she was still promised to him , if he had not been mistaken . At times he lay awake , sleepless , and it seemed incredible to him that they would really he married  --  hep251would really marry Helene Cady ? He would become a married man , she would become his wife ? . . . In her shyness she was eager to please him , already wifely and observant . She had learned quickly from him the affectionate camaraderie of this kind of heady , intimatefriendship ; Jesse had found in himself an ability to guide both himself and her , refusing to be self-conscious or embarrassed , refusing to give in to his perpetual sense of unworthiness . He must hide that from her . He had never been friendly with Anne-Marie , not really . They had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk of other things , it was really love they were talking about  --  Jesse eager , keyed up , jealous of her attention and her beauty , untrusting  --  though they had never been frank enough to use the vocabulary of love . With Helene , Jesse kept thinking of the rightness of their marriage . he kept thinking of Anne-Marie 's limitations . She had been able to respond to him only as a pretty woman , always conscious of her prettiness , conscious of Jesse as a young man who desired her , the two of them walking parallel in these roles as if on railroad tracks that would never meet . . . and so he had never felt any friendship for her , he had never trusted her the way he trusted Helene . He had never been friendly with any girl before Helene . Not even Hilda Pedersen . His " sister . " No , he had never been friendly with any girl , and he had to invent the casualness with which he greeted Helene each time they met , as if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the affection she felt for him . It was all so precarious , this business of trading in emotions  --  exactly what was love , what was it ? Could it he depended upon ? He loved Helene . He loved her , yes . I-Ic wanted to talk to her , to bring to her bizarre and random questions about life ; he wanted to talk to her about oddities , promises , incidents , newspaper items , the gossip of his rooming house , the weather , anything . He wanted to confer with her about the handling of each clay . This must have meant , Jesse believed , that he was now truly in love ; he did not feel combative or anxious in her presence . He was not driven by a desperate lust to bury himself in her body . They planned to marry when Jesse completed his intern year , the following July . On this day Trick had invited them for a drive in the country . He was very surprised and pleased about the engagement , he told them repeatedly  --  he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other . How strange , how surprising . . . . Trick had looked stunned when Jesse told him , but in the next instant he had smiled a quick , courteous , rather paternal smile , congratulating Jesse . He had met Helene only a few times . After Jesse told him about the engagement , as the weeks passed , Trick began to allude familiarly to it , smilingly , enthusiastically , as if he had really meant to bring the two of them together all along . " I had it in mind , I really did . She 's a remarkable young woman  --  very intelligent  --  just right for you . A very intelligent woman , " Trick told Jesse repeatedly . Jesse searched his face for a flash of cynicism , but Trick was sincere . He spoke rapidly , in a flat , earnest voice . She is just right for you . Just right . In front of Helene , Trick praised Jesse in the same earnest voice . It ran on and on , flattened , a little dead , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Jesse works harder than anyone I know . He 's totally dedicated . Almost possessed . It 's a gift of his , being able to work so hard . Your father told me he thinks Jesse has a brilliant career ahead of him in anything , anything he wants to do . . . he has to be careful not to waste himself .... " They were pushing him toward research , pure research . Jesse was uneasily flattered by Cady 's suggestions : he could get a postdoctoral grant at Harvard and work with Cady himself . Or he could get a similar grant somewhere else and work with a friend of Cady 's , another prominent man . Jesse tried to explain that he was interested in clinical work . He wanted to work with people . He talked over his plans with Trick , with Helene , and one long evening with Cady himself , when Helene had made dinner for the three of them . The food on Jesse 's plate had cooled , turned unappetizing , as they talked . Jesse 's forehead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own need to decide while everyone told him kindly not to make any decision now , to take his time . Cady was generous . He said gently to Jesse , " I see in you a genuine liking for people , maybe even a need for people . You want to feel your way along by gauging other people 's opinions of you , their satisfaction with you , and this seems easiest in terms of patients . The sick are always hopeful and always grateful . They are always immediate . They are very real . I can understand your interest in that kind of medicine . . . . But research is also a matter of other people . These people are not physically available top253you but that does n't mean they do n't exist . They exist in great numbers , a multiplication of the people you would ever actually help in medical practice . After all , Jesse , a man does n't exist simply in his skin , so that we must go around touching everyone ! . . . And then you will have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are in other parts of the world . You will be communicatingwith them constantly . And this is ultimately what is most satisfying about research . What you achieve  --  the progress you make  --  will enable thousands of other doctors to treat the sick , it will multiply you by thousands , you yourself multiplied by thousands , even millions . . . . You must think of that , Jesse ; always keep that in mind ! " Multiplied by millions ... . He came away from Cady burning with excitement , almost convinced . He felt so healthy now , so strong ! He even ate regularly . He was careful to eat hot food , to sleep as long as he could . He had become very important suddenly . If only he could have taken Cady 's advice and at the same time do what he really wanted to do , fulfill an ordinary internship and go into community health work , a general medical practice . . . he had been so moved by his work in the welfare wards that he could not imagine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vogel , Director of . . . . Helene , respecting his privacy , did not try to argue with him . Trick teased him a little about his liking for the bustle of hospital wards : You want to raise up the halt and the crippled , you want to raise the dead  --  a small ambition ! But he did not put much pressure on Jesse . He liked most to talk about himself , and on this drive Jesse was relieved that Trick was not bothering him . He spoke lightly , good-natured and very attentive to Helene . " And from then on I will fly from one capital city of the world to another , " he was saying , " treating only wealthy madmen and dining with kings and dictators . I will invent a new psycho-theological movement and announce myself its Messiah and appear on the cover of Time Magazine . And I will write poems , beautiful poems , poems of love and tenderness , and I will turn up in the intimate journals of the most outlandish people . But I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my dear , any time you want me ; I 'll be a candidate for any position in your life  --  a godfather to your first-born , a resident psychiatrist , anything ! You have only to command me to your side . "  | The car seemed to bounce with Trick 's good wishes . It was one of his good days , a surprisingly good day . He had evidently made up his mind about going to Massachusetts . For a while he had talked vaguely of quitting medicine and retiring , at the age of thirty-one , to some farm , an uncle 's farm in northern Minnesota , or of volunteering for a United Nations medical program , or of working somewhere with his hands . He had even sighed and hinted of marriage . " Should I marry ? Should I take that risk ? " But Jesse supposed this to be a joke , since he had never seen Trick with any woman . And Trick never spoke of any woman in particular . If he alluded to women , it was usually in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who clamored for him because he was going to be a doctor , and everyone knew that women were mad for doctors and for their money , for their skilled , practiced hands . " Unfortunately , the only woman suitable for someone like you and me , Jesse , is a woman like Helene , because she 's from a family of doctors and knows what to expect . She knows everything and yet she 's brave enough to marry a doctor . But you got to her first . " He said now , leaning across Jesse to speak to Helene , " Will you command me ? To come to your side , I mean . In the years ahead . Will I be Uncle Trick to your children ? You wo n't forget me , will you ? " " Of course not , " Helene said . " Because , you know , though I joke around a lot , you two are the people I like best  --  I admire most  --  along with your father , Helene , and a few other people , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me down somehow . They 've disappointed me . The years have gone by and you two are about all that 's left to me  --  hut I do n't want to embarrass you  --  " " You 're not embarrassing us , " Helene said uneasily . Jesse was silent , disliking Trick 's exaggeration . Why the hell did he always exaggerate ? " Jesse disapproves , " Trick said slyly . " I can always sense when Jesse disapproves . He is n't sure he will invite me to be his child 's godfather , or even trust me around his children . I can read his mind . " " Can you really read my mind , Trick ? " Jesse said lightly . " From the very first . Your mind is a complicated one but it repays study . " Trick 's voice sounded with delight . His good humor ,  |p255his  enthusiasm , made Jesse want to put his hand over Trick 's mouth and shut him up before he said too much . His shamelessness brought out shame in others . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Jesse said . " I was just watching the countryside . " He rubbed his fingers back and forth over Helene 's hand nervously . It was a private gesture , and yet he had the idea that Trick was aware of it . " Jesse , you 're not being entirely truthful . It is impossible to think about nothing . " He was taking them to the pathology farm , about which Jesse had heard wild tales ; Trick had spent a few weeks out there doing experiments on dogs for a professor named Ross , who was famous at the Medical Center for the federal grants he had brought them . The grants were confidential in their details  --  Jesse had heard extravagantrumors of million-dollar projects , research teams sworn to secrecy  --  all of it , he guessed , a jealous rerunning of the drama that had surrounded the nuclear chemists and physicists in the early forties . And how their secret work had become public , how it had flowered into a cataclysmic reality ! No wonder other people were jealous . And now there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of antidotes for germ-cloud formations . Medical students who announced themselves " politically honest " began to defend the money they would be making in a few years . It was a fact , they stated , that the " other side " would be doing this work whether they did it or not , so there was no moral problem involved  --  it was historical necessity that carried them on . Jesse kept quiet about this . It did not involve him personally . He did not believe he had to declare himself in any relationship to it . For as far back as he wanted to remember  --  that is , as far back as he had been Jesse Vogel  --  he had made his way through the tremulous packed streets of this life by fastening his gaze firmly before him , minding his own business , and if the pavement were to shrink suddenly to the width of a tightrope , he would have kept on in this steady , firm , unimaginative way , knowing that salvation is won only by hoarding the emotions . " Gatti @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rarely drops in . He says he 's allergic to the smell of manure . But really lie 's got a bleeding ulcer and is not a well man , I 'm afraid , " Trick was saying . He knew everything , everyone ; no stray rumor or oddity escaped him.  | He seemed to forget nothing and sometimes entertained Jesse and Helene by repeating conversations he had had with other people . " Do you know Gatti , Helene ? He looks like an Eskimo . There 's something cold and savage about his face . Big mustaches , a broad , flat face , a sloped forehead . You 've probably met him . I ca n't imagine anyone more antithetical to your father , who is so aristocratic  --  Imean in his bearing , his brains ; Gatti is crude and clumsy , he has a team of kids working for him out here who are like a circus act . I 'll introduce you . If Gatti had more sense he would outlaw visits like mine , but there is speculation that he night want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get back at Ross ... . Or do n't you know about that ? Jesse knows about that , the feud between Ross and Gatti . " " No , I do n't know about it . But never mind , " Jesse said . " It really goes back before your time in Ann Arbor . No need to dig it up . There 's enough shit flying loose at the moment without loosening up more material , " Trick said , and launched into a string of names and projects on the farm while Jesse tried to listen . He rubbed his thumb against the back of Helene 's hand , across the fine small knucklebones . " Helene , " Trick said , " you were wise to stick with chemistry . And you were wise to quit after getting your Master 's degree . Once you fool around in biology , once you stick your fingers in blood , something is absorbed into your own system and contaminates you . Ask your husband-to-be . He nearly puked when he saw his first cadaver , but the second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alike . Is n't that so ? Jesse aspires to a condition of personal bloodlessness  --  he told me that in an unguarded moment  --  butthat necessitates the expulsion of a lot of fluid . In chemistry it is n't very clean either ; in fact , it stinks a lot , but at least the stink is not anything personal . Out here . . . well , out here on the farm ... there are some hilarious moments , if you do n't have a weak stomach . " Helene stirred uneasily . " That 's the farm ahead . We 've been passing their pastureland . See all the No Trespassing signs ? A few farm kids from the area climbed over the fence one clay and were exploring . They must have been surprised as hell to see our livestock exhibiting itself ; they were sort of paralyzed and did n't even run away when the caretaker drove out in a jeep to yell at them . . . . See the gate ahead ? Whenp257some really high-level work was being done out here everyone had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then something happened , the project fell through , someone abandoned us for Berkeley , and things have loosened up a bit . How do you like the smell ? Do you smell anything unusual yet ? " Jesse smelled something acrid , an odor of faint rot . " I do n't think so , " Helene said uncertainly . " Maybe I 'm hypersensitive , " Trick said . They stopped at the gate and Trick rang a bell . After a short wait a middle-aged man came hurrying out ; he looked like an ordinary farmer in overalls , with a placid , bald head and a suntanned face . " This is the caretaker . It 's a weird setup , he and his wife and six or seven kids living in there and the rest of us out doing experiments  --  Hello , Franklin . How arc you today ? How is everything out here ? " The man flushed slightly at Trick 's gay attention and swung open the gate so Trick could drive through . The driveway was made of cinders . Behind the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barn , a large , humped building with a fresh coating of red paint and , in rows on either side of this barn , low , slant-roofed sheds made of metal and painted red also , with corrugated metal roofs . Jesse could sec cattle moving about in the space between the buildings . A few cars were parked nearby , and a large , battered yellow truck marked U-M Pathology Laboratory . Two small boys , the farmer 's children , were playing in the driveway and glanced up as Trick parked . " Can you smell anything yet ? " Trick said . They got out of the car . A fly immediately blundered against Jesse 's face and Jesse brushed it away . There was the sound of dogs harking , yipping . Someone was laughing . Trick led the way to the nearest shed , and Helene took Jesse 's arm . The strangeness of this place , the acrid smell , and the laughter made them both feel formal . " Anybody home ? " Trick shouted . The screen door of the shed opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a girl brushed past him , wearing shorts and a sweatshirt , and she cried out happily to Trick : " Dr. Monk , you fat thing ! Why are you honoring us with a visit ? " Then , catching sight of Jesse and Helene , she hesitated  --  self-conscious suddenly , she brushed something out of her hair and it fell to the ground . Behind her , in the doorway , two students were laughing about something . Jesse did not know them well . The girl's name was Peggy , but Jesse could not remember her last name . She was short and very perky , with a coy , monkeyish face . The thing she had brushed from her hair lay by her feet ; it looked like a pink strip of something , maybe rubber . She reddened and shook Trick 's hand . They appeared to be old friends . In turn , he introduced her to Jesse and Helene . Hearing that Helene was Benjamin Cady 's daughter , she nodded gravely ; to Jesse she said , " Oh , yes ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't we ? I 've heard good things about you . " The students behind her stepped out into the sunlight , stretching their arms . One of them put on a pair of sunglasses . They were all wearing old clothes and sweatshirts with smears of blood or grease on them . " Hey , it 's about lunchtime ! What are you cooking in there ? " Trick said , rubbing his hands . " Oh  --  do n't look ! Do n't look in there , " Peggy said quickly . " It 's sort of messy  --  these guys have been fooling around all day  --  You know what they 're like , Trick . " She brushed at her hair again , as if she thought something might still be caught in it . Jesse saw that the thing at her feet was a small piece of intestine . " What 's your project , still cats ? The same with me , " Trick said , making a face . " Who 's out here now ? Whose cars are those ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are fooling around with monkeys next door , " the boy with the sunglasses said . " Jesus , you should hear those things scream ! It 's worse than when you were out here . The next prefab is vacant but Ray Easton is supposed to come in for the summer session . I hope to be working for him , if I can swing it . Then , down there , the big prefab , they 're fooling around with sheep . You can see the sheep in the runway over there . Are n't they the damnedest looking things ? " In a pen behind the shed were a number of sheep of all sizes , even lambs . Most stood still . A few moved painfully around in the puddlesof mud and manure . Flies buzzed everywhere . Jesse and Helene went over to look . The sheep had had their wool shaved off in large , ungainly patches , and numbers had been painted on their hides with bright red and yellow paint . A strange smell was loosed by their movement , not of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself and Helene . " Then the sheep still have Iambs , even out here ? "  | " Oh , sure . That 's part of it , " the boy said . " It certainly is part of it , " Peggy laughed . Her face had gone scarlet , not from embarrassment but from excitement ; she kept smiling at Jesse as if they were indeed old friends . Jesse thought her peculiar . " They 're always herding the poor old ewes in with those damned rams . There are three rams out here . The females get the worst of it naturally , as in so-called human circles , and the rams just stuff themselves at the trough . Look at that poor ewe there ! Do you see the one I mean ? Barry Wilkinson had a bunch of first-year students , I swear they were freshmen , out here one day fooling around , I do n't think he paid them more than fifty cents an hour , and they were trying to inject stuff into the sheep . That one started bleeding like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What do I know about applying a tourniquet to a goddamn sheep ? " " But Peggy saved the thing 's life . She was very noble ! " " I could hardly breathe , the thing stank so . Oh , those blue eyes ! The sheep have such crazy blue eyes ! I dream about those awful dumb blue eyes , like the eyes of crazy or dying people , " Peggy said with a fake shudder . She was standing beside Jesse and she hugged herself as if cold , grinning up at him . " See that big barn ? That 's where they do the work . It 's specially equipped for radiation work . Is it ever creepy in there  --  you see those crazy blue eyes staring at you from all over  --  A lot of sheep die in there and they 've got a nerve to complain about us  --  because Wilkinson is trying all these new teaching methods , you know , bringing undergraduates out and letting them experiment . He says it 's an elite community out here and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They do n't work with the radiation stuff itself , the kids , I think they just prep the sheep . But they ca n't do that right . They 're so clumsy with a razor , I do n't know how they manage to shave themselves in the morning . " A young man came out of the next prefab , letting the screen door slam behind him . Jesse recognized him as a faculty member . " Hello , Trick , what are you doing back here ? " He grinned and waved at the others . " It 's a bad day for a visit . The flies are biting . " Everywhere there were large blue-black flies , drowsy with their weight or with the rich , slightly rotting odor of the place . They crawled on the sheep 's splotched hides and passive , patient faces . A bedraggled sheep with the number 18 painted in red on her side approachedp26o the fence near Jesse , nudging it . Jesse and Helene glanced at each other . On the side of the sheep 's neck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lazily . " What are they doing with the sheep ? " Jesse asked Peggy . " Oh , it 's a fertility experiment . I think they put some stuff in the jugular vein and see what happens  --  I mean , how the Iambs turn out . How they 're changed . I do n't know what results they 've gotten yet . They have an awful lot of money to fool around with though , " she said , dropping her voice , " and Phil over there is jealous as hell about it . His project is going under , everybody says . Come look in the window at his stuff ; he wo n't mind , " she said . She took Jesse 's arm . She was so short she had to stand on a concreteblock to look in the window , but Jesse could look right in just by standing on his toes  --  he saw pens with dogs crowded into them , a number of single , small metal cages crammed with dogs . Most of the dogs were hunched over and motionless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away and long purplish incisions on its body stared back at Jesse from a few feet away ; it reminded Jesse of a patient he had seen the day before on his rounds at the hospital . A cocker spaniel lay beneath the collie , between its legs . The spaniel 's fur was frayed and was coming off in unsightly strips . Flies crawled over a large open sore on its neck . " Maybe you should n't look , " Jesse said to Helene , but she had already looked in . She turned away coolly , showing no distress . " Why are the dogs so quiet ? " Jesse asked . " They 've been fixed up , " Peggy said , drawing a finger swiftly across her throat ; " they had their barks removed . God , can you imagine what it would be like ? That 's what makes everyone mad about Bruner 's monkeys . It 's like a jungle out here sometimes , the way those things shriek ! Luckily , old Edna is the only one out today and she must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They 're experimenting with burns , using flame throwers , and it 's the goddamnedest smell you ever smelled . You can smell it right now , and they have n't been fooling around since last week . That singed smell  --  it smells like fur and meat  --  that 's from the monkeys . Do you smell it ? " " I guess so , " Jesse said . " God , I hate monkeys , " Peggy said . " They shoot some of the fire down the things ' throats , so those monkeys do n't make much noise . But it 's like a slaughterhouse out here , the way it stinksp261sometimes . I 've been asked to join a reform committee and I just might do it . " Jesse saw more sheep moving in a corral behind the barn . They moved slowly , stiffly . He had a sudden vision , an involuntary vision , of the countryside filling up with sheep , their battered , clumsy , dirty bodies moving slowly , sleepily , bumping into one another as their eyesight deteriorated , sinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lambs nudging the ewes , all of them crowded sleepily together and too stupid to cry out in pain , crowding the landscape , easing outward so that they strained against the fences and broke them down ... . If Helene was upset by this she did not show it ; she stood a little apart from the others , watchful and poised . Trick took them to another shed , where several people were sitting eating sandwiches . One of them , a man in his forties by name ; and the single girl , who had the slanted , squinting eyes of an Oriental , was a stranger to him . They were sitting on the front steps of their prefab , waxed paper spread neatly on their knees . They offered everyone coffee but only Trick accepted . Peggy came hurrying after them and cried out that they should not miss the " egg room " : " It 's refrigerated  --  it 's the only place out here that 's bearable . " The Oriental girl stood , as if made uneasy by the visitors or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remained of her sandwich in a piece of waxed paper . The talk here was of hamsters , evidently an unexciting topic . Howe took them inside to look at the cages : row after row of nervouslittle animals with pink ratlike tails and curious twitching faces . The stench was sharp . " We 're working with their tongues . Sensory paths , " Howe said . As he walked between the rows of cages he tapped at them fondly . Trick seemed quite interested in the project . " We 've got a new grant for next year , " Howe said , and Trick congratulated him . Nearby there was a shriek  --  a rising series of shrieks  --  then silence . Howe showed them a graph with a complicated system of lines and bars of red and black . Jesse tried to interest himself in it but he kept glancing at Helene . She had worn a yellow dress that day , and though the color was attractive , it gave her complexion a yellowish cast ; she looked , a little sick . Her hair was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ears , and she wore small jade earrings . She seemed cautious , guarded . There was something of her father 's cool haughtiness in her . The shriek came again from next door  --  Howe explained that it was a monkey  --  and Helene 's mouth tightened . Jesse took her hand . It remained in his , inert and damp . They went back outside . Someone had just driven up in a station wagon and several students were busy unloading boxes . Trick walked them down to the end of the row of prefabs where a radio was blaring and around to the sheep pen again . Jesse noticed how passively and fixedly Helene stared at the sheep . " This is a very important project they 've got going , " Trick said excitedly . " Puttingradioactive stuff in the sheep to test for mutations  --  It should make big news . I wish them well . But I wonder what the hell they do with the dead sheep ? I do n't think you could dispose of a dead radioactive sheep in any ordinary way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I must ask about that , " Trick said . Peggy took them across a meadow strewn with concrete blocks and other junk , to the big barn . They could hear a humming noise . Another radio was playing inside , turned up high , and as they entered the barn Jesse smelled the sharp , half-pleasant stench of old blood . Yes , there were bloodstains on the floor , great dried pools everywhere . Only a few graduate assistants were around but they did n't look busy . On the counters there were rags and needles and bottles , tubes , rolls of tape , lunch bags , half-empty bottles of soda pop , tin cans , boxes . Against one wall were shelves of jars with embryos in them , one embryo to a jar , row upon row . The embryos were small , hunched-over , perfect little creatures . " At least this place is air-conditioned , " Peggy said . " Gatti himself designed the inside . He has a thing about stuff collected in bottles . He insists upon his people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire or breakage or anything he has a lot left over . He 's very conservative . Is n't this place elegant ? They give themselves airs over here . But I would n't want to work with all these dead things . " " Peggy likes live things . Sheep and goats and things like that , " someone snickered . " Oh , shut up ! Just because I saved your sheep from bleeding to death . . . . Tell your kids not to bother me next time . I got bloodp263all over my clothes , even down inside my shoes . How the hell do you think I looked going back to Ann Arbor ? " she said angrily . The boys laughed . They went back out into the warm air . Jesse looked at Helene , but her expression was demure and opaque . She seemed slightly withdrawn from him , as if surrendering him to Peggy 's boisterousness . Her passivity disturbed him . Trick kept turning to her , trying to include her in his noisy conversation with the others , but she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he even reached out to touch her shoulder , an absentminded gesture , only part of his conversation . Helene 's expression did not change but she stepped back . " As with the animals , so with us , " Trick said . " They heal without as many complications , though , and do n't know enough to sue us . I thought I was fed up with cats , but on second thought I prefer them to your sheep . They do n't stink as much . The best material to work with would be human beings , of course , but that 's not possible in this country . We are so civilized , " he said , leering , scowling . He walked briskly ahead of the others as if leading them , the center of their attention . Jesse , walking with Helene , felt sodden , satiated with the sights of this place and with the odor of singed flesh and blood and rot . He was tired of Trick 's voice . He would have liked to take Helene aside and explain to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for himself , not this particular life : it was necessary to work through it , to push oneself through it , to come out at the other end as . . . as a man who might save the lives of other men . . . . What other wavy was there , except to pursue truth through the bodies of animals ? Trick was saying something about beer . Would they all like to drive out for some beer ? " It 's getting late for us . We 'd better go home , " Jesse said . " What ? Why ? " " We have to get back . " " Oh , hell . Do n't let him push you around , Helene , " Trick said . " He always wants to bring the party to an end , he always wants to work ! Let 's all go out somewhere and have some beer . " " I 'd rather go back to Ann Arbor , " Jesse said . " I have some hospitalreports to write up . " " God , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around Helene 's shoulders , " you are obviously not going to remain faithful to Jesse for long . Work , all he knows is work ! Not being a genius like me  --  how many of you are ?  --  the poor guy has to frazzle his brain out . He 'll disappoint you  --  and when he does , remember to give old Trick a call ; command me and I am yours , I 'll hurry to your side  --  " Jesse flinched ; Helene , unsmiling , moved away from Trick . The others laughed . Peggy poked Trick in the stomach . " You , what do you need beer for ? You carry it all over with you like a camel ! " she cried . " Do n't do that , " said Trick . " I have n't had a bowel movement for fifteen days . I 'm a walking disaster . It 's all coiled up inside me and I need the extra space . " They laughed . Jesse grinned in a sudden hot anger and walked Helene back to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out : " Be right with you , kids ! Be right with you ! " And he did hurry after them , puffing , panting , red in the face and looking ashamed . With a weary yodel he slid into the car beside Jesse . " All , I talk too much . I know it , " he said . Jesse and Helene were silent . " I just thought it might be a nice idea to have a few beers , " Trick said lamely . " But you probably have no appetite for it . You were right , Jesse , absolutely right . I do n't like this crowd anyway . Except for Gordon Howe , they 're bores . " He chatted at them all the way back to Ann Arbor , his spirits rising slowly even though Jesse did not bother to reply . Helene stared out the window . Trick seemed not to know the extent of their displeasure , or pretendednot to know . When he let them out near campus he grinned happily at them . " Well , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a drive in the country ! " When they were alone in the Cadys ' apartment Helene sat down as if exhausted . She put her hands to her face , massaging her eyes . Jesse , standing above her , was fearful of touching her  --  she was so cool , so withdrawn , so independent of him . " Did it upset you ? " he asked . She shook her head slightly , without looking at him . Outside the window an elm tree blocked out the sun ; this room , a kind of sitting room , was shaded and cool . Jesse felt the presence of Dr. Cady here , though they were alone . On a nearby table stood the framed photograph  --  Cady and his two co-winners of the Nobel Prize ,  |p265smiling  gentlemen who seemed to be looking directly at Jesse , invitinghim to join them . If he had to make his way to them through the stink of blood and intestines and burned flesh , taking wisdom where he found it , what did that matter ? What did it matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force . She did not draw away . He wondered what she was thinking . Her scent was light , pale , a blond-colored scent . She was a mystery , like the mysteries explored out there in the sheds , beneath the rusty corrugated roofs , in the din of portable radios and lunchtime joking . What was living performed the rites of living ; when it no longer performed these rites it was not " living . " Was n't Jesse himself a kingdom of these living cells , all of them performing excellently ? Was n't Helene , so sternly attractive , so stubborn beneath her appearance of submission , herself a marvelous kingdom of cells , unfathomable cells that demanded awe ? It was necessary that a man throw himself into the study of such mysteries , Jesse thought . All truth , any truth , justified itself . That collie 's large glassy eyes . The stink of putrid flesh , singed flesh , the shriek of a terrified animal , Peggy 's shrill flirting with him . " Did all that upset you ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what we have to go through . " " What ? Who has to go through ? " " You and me . People . How we have to live and die . How our bodies will smell , " she said faintly . She looked up at him . Her eyes were darkened by threads of blood , as if by the seriousness of her thinking . Jesse was astonished . He had wanted to comfort her , but how could he comfort such words ? It hurt him to think that she should contemplate suffering like that , moving restlessly and independently of him , of his love for her , as if he had not the power to protect her . . . . Did she really think they must suffer like those animals ? Her flesh and his flesh , flesh no more divine than that of the animals , doomed to the same bawdy fates ?  |p266And  your family is .. . Scattered . Your entire family is scattered . . . ? My parents are dead . I 'm very sorry to hear that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time ago . Around Christmas . . . the roads were icy . Silence , during which questions rose like bubbles in Cady 's head : Jesse imagined he could see them . What , what did you say exactly ? Your family is scattered or dead ? Your parents are dead ? How exactly did they die ? Jesse sat facing this man , an inheritor , a hopeful son-in-law , a kind of thief . He wanted to explain to Cady that those deaths were long ago , long ago . They did not matter now . How could they matter now ? He wanted to erase all thought of those deaths from Cady 's mind , he wanted to seize hold of the man by his frail noble shoulders and shake him . ... Dead ? All dead ? Where are they buried ? Where do the dead go ? Where are the dead at this moment , Jesse ? After a few moments Cady began to speak gently . He told Jesse about his wife 's death many years ago . Helene had been twelve at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the death was somehow fresh , permanently fresh in their lives . Jesse stared at Cady 's hands ; at his small , perfect , oval fingernails , which were well-tended . Those hands had outlived his wife 's hands . What did that mean ? Where are the dead at this moment ? Jesse began to feel lightheaded . Panicky . A copy of Time Magazine lay on a nearby table and Jesse could see the picture of Harry Truman on the cover . It lay at a slant toward him , the face distorted , shortened , the eyes hardly more than slits . A father 's face . Alive or dead ? Jesse sat with his knees pressed together , suddenly afraid he might say something wrong . Make a mistake . He might ask Cady where the dead went , and where they were all these years  --  he could almost hear his voice breaking into Cady 's voice , demanding to be told the truthAn automobile accident . Christmastime . Long ago . And you have no more relatives , Jesse ?  |p267No  . Yes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Could n't find them . Have you tried to find them ? No . Why not ? They 're in the cemetery , waiting . Do you go to visit them ? No , no ! Why not , Jesse ? " . . . so we were fortunate enough to have two sets of grandparents , very loving grandparents , for Helene . . . , " Cady was saying , Jesse nodded gravely , sympathetically . What was this man talkingabout ? It was hard for Jesse to follow . When he sat in Cady 's lecture he could follow everything the man said , no matter how complex it was ; here , so close to him , as they talked of these softspokenmatters , Jesse 's mind seemed to jump all over. ... you said you lived with your grandfather , Jesse ? " " Yes . " " How long was that ? " " A few years , until I went away to school . . . a few years . . . I do n't remember exactly .... " My god , Jesse thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he want from me ? . . . Benjamin Cady had won the Nobel Prize for his work in cerebellar physiology and always , always he was asking questions , staring at faces . Jesse felt an awe that verged on dread in his presence . He was always thinking . Thinking . Jesse wished that Helene would join them  --  a third person would help , would tilt the conversation in another direction , would save him . And is your grandfather dead too ? What , they 're all dead ? Everybody is dead ? Do n't you think that 's strange ? ... and your grandfather . . . ? " " He died a few years ago . " Cady nodded . his face was grave as Jesse 's , but still he fixed Jesse with a certain clear-eyed look , as if assessing him . Where was Helene ? She was chaste and comradely , his Helene . He loved her . He loved her . With her he forgot about the past ; or , if he had to talk about it , he lied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , without fear , but when Cady questioned him like this he lied miserably  --  he could not keep his shame down . Helene was in the rear of the apartment and Jesse waited anxiously to hear her footstep  --  if he just heard her coming , or could pretend to hear her , he could get to his feet and bring this conversation to a halt . He glanced up , imagining that he heard her . Cady noted his attentiveness and seemed pleased . " My daughter is a very serious , very steady young woman ... a very special young woman , I think , " Cady said . " You 've made her very happy already . I am grateful to you for that . Yes , very grateful . I hope you will love Helene and respect her always , all your life , " Cady said , his voice dimming suddenly as if he were about to weep . " Yes , I will , " Jesse said , startled and a little alarmed . " I willalways love and respect your daughter , yes .... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurried up the steps of the apartment house with the piece of paper folded in his pocket , crumpled first in anger and then folded in two . She was waiting for him nervously , wearing the same yellow dress she had worn that day at the experimental farm . Was she wearing it on purpose ? Her face was hectic and tender . Jesse wondered if Trick had already telephoned her . How much did she know ? What was going on ? " You sounded so troubled over the phone . . . , " Jesse said . He squinted at her bright , confused face . It was not like Helene to be so nervous . " I do n't think it 's important , Jesse . It 's just  --  something that came in the mail  --  I thought I should show it to you , " she said . Jesse took the paper from her , saw that it was the same dull , heavy white stationery that Trick had used for Jesse 's letter . No surprise . Grimly , his face set for disapproval , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : I have always been of the conviction that love , because it is based upon the sexual drive , is an illusion , just as the sexual drive is to some extent an illusion , dependent solely upon ideal biological and environmental conditions . Sexual desire is a superficial " instinct " that vanishes at the first sign of danger , as you know , and therefore any emotion based upon it is fantasticand wasteful . But you know all this ! ' What you also know , and what I have learned , is that love can exist truly , apart from accidents of the body and the environment . Forp269some time now I have been in love . But I hesitated to tell you because of the embarrassment and awkwardness it might cause you . I know that you are going to marry Jesse and that there is no chance of my changing your mind . How could I change your mind ? He is an exceptional young man , far superior to me . Everyone admires his ambition , even if they do not always appreciate Jesse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was struck by his seriousness , his dedication to his work , a strange inner certainty of his that the rest of us lack . At times he has such a strange look ! Am I exaggerating if I say that he is a dangerous man ?  --  or would be dangerous if he had n't your love and his work to confine him ? Yours always , sadly , TrickHelene was watching Jesse 's face . " Are you very angry with him ? " she said . Jesse shrugged his shoulders irritably . " I . . . I was so surprised .... I never thought . . . Please do n't be angry with him , Jesse . " ' I 'm not angry . I do n't get angry , " Jesse said . He had an impulse t o crumple this piece of paper too . He was certain that Helene had enjoyed reading it and having him read it . She was very warm , agitated , excited . How womanly she was in her excitement ! Turning f rom her , disturbed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowly . He could recognize Trick 's glinting smile behind it , that cautious skeptical leer of his . A dangerous man ... . " He did n't say I should n't show the letter to you , " Helene said . " I feel very sorry for him ... and we wo n't be seeing him again , Jesse , after next week .... " " No , we wo n't be seeing him again . " He took his own letter out to show her . It was not typed , as I Telene 's was , but scrawled in Trick 's slanting handwriting , falling ignobly and clownishly down the page . " Here . Read this , " Jesse said . Dear Jesse : She has received a letter from me today . Will she show it to you ? Or will she keep it a secret ? If she loves you she 'll show it to you.  | Will you forgive me , Jesse ? I mailed a declaration of love to her this morning . All day long I have been sick with shame , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that my life disgusts me , that I am disgusted with my work and my jokes , disgusted to the point of death . Jesse , there is such a gift in you ! There is nothing in me . Your soul is as tough as the muscles of your body but my soul is flabby and drained and mealy from disuse . I am always examining myself in the mirror , hoping for a change . You do n't know what my room is like because you 've never come up here . You 've never seen the mirror in my bathroom . You ca n't imagine how ugly a face looks in that mirror , especially my face . I am always staring at myself . I am always pulling my cheeks to show my eyes edged with red and crazy . I look like an ape . I joke with myself in the mirror . You are a man who does not even bother looking at himself in the mirror , because he knows just what he looks like . Always . I was wrong to send her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will never see the two of you again . I will never bother you . Can I retreat from your lives with your good will , can I see you just once more ? I will telephone Helene and ask if you will forgive me . I beg you to forgive me . May I take you out to dinner ? And then I will vanish from your lives forever . I have been working on some poems . I think I will call them " Poems Without People . " I am the speaker in all of them but I do n't count myself as a human being , because I am drained out and soulless . Here is a poem I wrote this morning : SONG OF MYSELFI am a vile jelly that grew wingsand a bumpy facial structurebeneath your bare feet I would subside again to jellyto joyYours always , Trickp271Helene read the letter through twice , carefully . " I do n't understand that poem , " she said . " The hell with it , " Jesse said . " What is he trying to say . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and crumpled it in his fist . " Jesse , you should n't do that . Please , Jesse , It 's like striking him ... it 's . . . He loves us both very much .... " " The hell with his love . " " But he is a good person . He is a good person , " Helene said slowly . " He 's crazy . " He took Helene 's letter and angrily crumpled it too . " He asks us to forgive him .... " The telephone rang . Helene hesitated . Jesse waved her away , his heart pounding . " All right , answer it . Go ahead . Let him take us out . And that 's all , that 's the end of it , we 'll never see him again . Tell him that . " She went to answer the telephone , relieved . Yes , it was Trick . Jesse stood by the window and covertly watched her , jealous of the rosiness of her skin , the delicate energy of her face . She was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more attractive . IIe understood . He told himself that it was natural , he should not be so angry with her ; he must control himself . Once they were married there would be no rival for her love . No Trick preening and weeping over himself . . . in fact , Jesse thought suddenly , she would not meet very many men at all , she would not meet his colleagues , she would be his wife and the mother of his children and she would belong to him entirely . She would belong to him . His heart pounded with the hot urgency of this fact , his need to make it come true , while Helene stood a few yards away , listening to Trick . Jesse could make out Trick 's voice  --  how could he talkso much ! How did he dare to call ! Helene was saying softly , " No ... . Oh , no . Not at all , Trick . No . He is n't angry , no . Please do n't talk like that . . . . Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hand over the receiver and said , " He wants to talk to you , Jesse . He wants to arrange a time to take us out to dinner . " " I do n't want to talk to him . " " Jesse ... ? " " Make the plans yourself . "  | So she made the plans . Trick was to pick them up on Sunday , at seven o'clock ; but for some reason he arrived an hour early . Jesse was already there . He remembered the several times Trick had cone early to have coffee with him , always insisting that he was on time and that Jesse was mistaken ; now , rather gaily , he insisted that he was to arrive at six o'clock , that Helene must have made a mistake , he even accused her of being " charmingly feeble-minded . . . . " He had bought a new outfit for the occasion : a jacket of white and powderbluestripes , a dark checked tic that did not quite match the jacket but looked very smart , and pale-blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trick 's stomach protruded painfully . His hair had been cut . Jesse saw , involuntarily , that Trick 's skull looked pinkish and weak at its crown . " Yes , we agreed on six o'clock  --  do n't you remember ? " Trick said to Helene . " I must have forgotten , " Helene said slowly . " Six o'clock . Absolutely . " He drove them downtown to a large steak house . Trick and Helene did most of the talking . They were nimble and abstract with each other , their remarks scuttling across Jesse without quite touching upon him , as if they were both afraid of Jesse . Jesse himselffelt unaccountably nervous . It was difficult for him to look Trick in the face . Trick chattered rapidly about any number of things , always circling back to the topic of the letters and the poem . " I should n't have burdened you with my troubles , " he said . " Bad poetry should always he kept secret . It 's as boring as dreams  --  as private and as boring as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggestions for dinner , reading off the menu to them . " I 've been here several times . They serve excellent food here . It 's very reliable . In fact , my parents wanted to take Jesse here the last time they were visiting me but Jesse was too busy that evening . " Jesse 's head ached . All this troubled him , irritated him : Trick 's talk and Helene 's cautious quick agreement . . . the drone of other Sunday customers , travelers and parents visiting their children at the university . . . So many people , so many crowded tables , so many confusing conversations ! Jesse never ate in restaurants like this . It sickened him a little , the din of voices and silverware , the expense , the ceremony of food heaped upon plates , each table centeredp273inward upon food and drink . Their drinks arrived and Trick proposed a toast to their wedding and their lifelong happiness . Jesse wondered if he was joking : but no , he looked serious . " Yes , to your lifelong happiness  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his gaze upon a complicated brass chandelier and tried not to pay much attention to what Trick was saying . He returned to the topic of the letters again , apologized again , and chided Helene gently once again about having forgotten about the correct time . Jesse 's heart pounded with a sudden rage , because of course Helene had been right about the time and Trick wrong  --  and yet Trick kept insisting that he was right ! Jesse did not dare to look at him . He was relieved when Helene murmured something placid , something agreeable  --  a vague apology for having forgotten the time  --  " I have so much to think of , " she said . " Ah yes , obviously you do ! " Trick said at once . " In your life I am not a very crucial event . Obviously ! In spite of my bulk , I am about the size of the jack of hearts seen sideways  --  or am I the joker maybe ? " When Helene did not reply and Jesse sat silent , he went on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boston . He had many years of study ahead and he would have to undergo a formal psychoanalysis . He intended to be a psychoanalyst himself . " How ironic , you are thinking . . . ? " he joked , but it was no joke , and neither Helene nor Jesse responded . After a moment Helene spoke of their plans for the next week . They would drive up and move Jesse into the interns ' residence hall . She planned to stay in Chicago for a while , perhaps she would get a job there , try to save a little money . . . . Trick laughed at this , as if to suggest that Helene did not need to have money with so wealthy a father ; Jesse felt another pang of rage . He finished his drink . Trick ordered another round immediately . " But Trick , I have n't finished my drink . . . I really do n't want another , " Helene said . Trick leaned against the table , big and anxious , his hair coming loose on one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narrowedhis eyes and tried to look at Trick . He had been seeing that earnest , mottled skin for too many months . And that mouth . That moving mouth . And Trick 's big feet under the table , crowding against Jesse 's . Even when Jesse moved his legs to one side Trick humped into them . " A cigarette . Let 's all have a cigarette , " Trick said.  | He offered cigarettes to Helene , who did not smoke , and to Jesse , who thought suddenly that he would like to smoke  --  but he hesitated , then refused . He would not take one of Trick 's cigarettes . Trick 's hands were trembling . He sucked at the cigarette and then at his drink , holding one in each hand . There was a feverish cast to his eyes . " I do n't think you forgive me , " he said finally . " Trick , please  --  " Helene said . " It 's Jesse . Jesse does n't forgive me . " " Jesse does . He does . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With difficulty Jesse forced himself to look Trick in the eye . " I am looking at you . I forgive you , " he said . His mouth smiled absurdly . " As soon as I mailed the first letter I knew I had made a terrible mistake .... " " Please do n't keep thinking about it , " Helene said . " But I 'll keep thinking about it the rest of my life . It 's one of the events of my life , " Trick said . " We can talk of other things tonight .... " " Yes , other things . . . we can talk of other things . . . . I should be able to express myself more coherently , " Trick muttered . " I want only to please you . The two of you . I do n't want you to leave Ann Arbor hating me . But what can a man say to two people in love , people who are going away together . . . ? People in love do n't need anyone else to complete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them out to dinner . Obviously not . They only acquiesce to their friends out of charity . " " Oh , Jesus , " Jesse said . " Jesse is irritated with me . Yes . I knew it . I anticipated it . I stayed up all night last night and wrote some poems .... Would you like to see them ? " Trick seemed not to notice that the waitress was bringing their dinners to them , and as he reached awkwardly into his coat pocket he nearly jostled her . " Oh , excuse me ! " he cried . " I did n't see you . . . are you back already ? . . . Everything is going so fast .... " " We can read the poems later . It 's too dark in here , " Jesse said . " You can hold them up to the light , " Trick said . He handed them across the table to Jesse and Helene while thep275waitress put down their plates . Jesse wanted to tear up the pieces of paper and toss them in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of paper . " Why do you call them Poems Without People ' ? That 's such a strange title .... " " Because , because I ca n't write about people . I do n't know anything about people , " Trick said eagerly . He hunched forward against the table , pushing himself onto the edge of his chair . His knee nudged Jesse 's . " What do you think ? Which one are you reading ? I 'm sorry I did n't have time to type them out . . . my handwritinglooks like hell .... " Jesse looked on while Helene held the piece of paper up to the light .

What do you think of it ? " Trick said . He was talking very loudly . Jesse , who made no sense of the poem and who felt a sudden violent exasperation with Trick , took the poems from Helene and folded them in two . " We can talk about this after dinner , " he said . " Oh ... did you fold them ? " Trick asked . They turned to their dinner  --  Jesse picked up his fork angrily ; Trick picked up his knife and fork as if he had no idea of what to do with them . He sawed at the meat on his plate . He cut his steak into several large pieces and raised one to his mouth . " I 'm only guessing at life , " he said humbly . " The only person I can write @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sequence of poems Poems Without People . ' Because the only person in them is myself and I do n't count . " Trick glanced at the meat on his fork and lowered it to his plate , confused . For some reason Jesse felt his mouth twisting into a smile  --  a grin . He laughed out loud . Trick glanced up at once , blinking . " Why are you laughing , Jesse ? Are you laughing at me ? In front of her ? " " I did n't mean anything by it , " Jesse said . But his face was still oddly , brightly amused  --  he could hardly keep from laughing again . Trick cut the piece of meat into two smaller pieces . His movements were brisk and self-conscious . " I like to see Jesse laugh . I should n't complain . He does n't laugh often enough for a young man his age . I like to see the two of you together , smiling together . Do you know I 've followed you ? Oh yes , " he said gravely , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stared at the heaped food on his plate . Mashed potatoes , glazed carrots , a large greasy juicy steak . . . . He seemed unable to think of what to do with all this . He glanced up at Jesse , smiling . " Yes , I might as well admit it . I have no shame . I 've often followed the two of you at a discreet distance , in disguise . Sometimes in disguise as a trash barrel , sometimes as a dancing bear . . . . But it 's so cruel to be always kept at a distance , especially a discreet distance .... " " Trick , are you joking ? " Helene asked nervously . " Joking , " Trick said flatly . He seemed to be testing , tasting thep277word . He shook his head no . No . Confused , he picked up a large roll and broke it into smaller pieces ; he buttered one of the pieces crudely , but then put it down on the tablecloth near his plate . His eyes skimmed over Jesse 's and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dinner . You are n't eating anything . " Jesse and Helene had not touched their food . " Why are n't you eating with me ? Do I offend you ? " Trick said . " Trick , please . . . . You must be joking , " Helene said . " You accepted my offer to take you out and then you forgot about the time . Deliberately . You tried to imply that I had come an hour early in order to embarrass me . And now you 've come out with me , as my guests , and you wo n't eat in order to embarrass me . You are demonstrating that in my presence you have no appetite ! " Trick pushed his own plate away from him abruptly . The tablecloth was pulled up and Trick 's water glass would have been upset if Jesse had n't steadied it . " You are passing judgment on me and I ca n't stop you . You can see right through me into my brain . Shall I confess something . . . ? I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it with you in mind , Helene . In a cadaver room ... I had an idea suddenly . . . the idea came to me the way my poems come to me , in a fierce rush , like a dream . . . in a cadaver room I helped myself to a piece of a human being .... " He smiled slyly at them . " Yes , a human being . . . I helped myself . . . . I know I should n't be telling you this . But I think I will . I want to confess everything . I cut out of a female about your age , Helene , a uterus that was not at all damaged , and I took it home with me in a brown paper bag and kept it in the refrigerator for a while . . . and then I did a very strange thing , I tried to broil it .... I wanted to broil it and eat it like chicken , which it resembles to some extent .... " Jesse and Helene stared . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Part of it got burned and part of it was raw . And it did n't taste like chicken , " Trick said with a shiver , though he was still smiling . " Are you joking again ? " Jesse said in amazement . Trick 's face hardened . " Jokes . What are jokes ? I do n't know what a joke is , " he said contemptuously . He glanced at Helene and his face screwed up as if he were about to spit . " You do n't have any appetite , eh ? You are rather bloodless , Helene . How will you be a match for this fiery young man ? " " Jesse , I think we should leave , " Helene said faintly . Jesse helped her up . " We 'll get a taxi back . Do n't bother coming with us , " Jesse said . " Leaving , you 're leaving already . . . ? Why is everything going so fast ? " Trick said vacantly . He stared at Jesse . " Oh , please . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've been waiting for this evening for so long , for so many hours .... " " We 're leaving , " Jesse said angrily . Trick followed them , protesting . He was carrying his napkin . " Oh , please do n't leave ! " he cried . People stared at him . " Do n't abandon me ! Why do people fear honesty , why do they betray their friends when their friends expose their hearts ? You know I love you , both of you . But you 're walking away . You 're forcing me to chase after you . " " Stay the hell away from us , " Jesse said . " Nobody 's forcing you to do anything . " " He 's sick , " Helene whispered . " Come on . Let 's get a taxi , " Jesse said . They hurried to the corner but Trick followed after them , panting . When , in a rage , Jesse glanced around , he saw Trick 's big flushed face and his hand , with the napkin in it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Behind him , in the large , ornate doorway of the restaurant , someone was calling after them . Trick said loudly , " A poet can express himself obliquely , in poems , he can say things that his friend wo n't allow him to say in the daylight ! I have another poem called " Mouth " that is dedicated to Jesse . It 's about my own mouth . You left it back in the restaurant but I can recite it  --  " " Go to hell ! " Trick called after them in a shrill , oratorical voice . " My poem is called Mouth . ' It goes like this  --  That mouth . Enormous . / It is an opening like sand / falling beneath your feet  --  / a surprise of a hole , falling away / suddenly  --  " " Will you shut up ! Go to hell ! " Jesse cried . " At the rim of the mouth / you surprise yourself / you are eager to be  --  "  | " Shut up ! " " You 're confusing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Jesse , you 're confusing me  --  At the rim of the mouth  --  at the rim  --  You become this pulp / you surrender your name  --  I ca n't remember the right order . You 've confused me . " People on the sidewalk had stopped to stare at Trick . He caught up to Jesse and Helene and took hold of Jesse 's arm . " Jesse , you have no lyricism in your soul . Your soul is pure and abstract . He has plans for his future , Helene , that are pure and abstract and criminal ! He told me himself . He wants to do only good and to save people , he does n't want to stick his nose in anybody 's mucus  --  but still he 's planning a family , Helene , four or five children at least  --  he told me so himself ! But the mother-to-be at that time was wider in the pelvis than you . Or does he want five children from you too ? " Jesse shoved Trick away . " Oh , you want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Will you get the hell away from us ? " " Fight me then . Come on . " " Get out of here ! " He rushed at Jesse . Jesse shoved him away again . Around them on the sidewalk people stood , gaping , and the manager of the restaurant had come out . Trick tried to grab Jesse , tried to embrace him , and this time Jesse shoved him away with his knee . His knee caught Trick in the belly . Trick grunted in surprise but came back at once  --  he threw himself at Jesse and the two of them stumbled and fell . Trick fell on top of Jesse . Jesse rolled away nimbly ; he had not been hurt , he felt only an enormous exhilarating rage . What surprise , to feel this rage ! To feel his blood coursing so strongly ! He jumped up , strong in the legs , the very muscles of his legs long prepared for this , and the muscles of his torso and shoulders and arms long prepared , eager , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the face  --  Jesse 's fists felt hard and distant as rocks . Painless . Helene was calling his name and trying to pull him away . But it was distant , painless . His panting breath was painless . Trick , on his feet again , stood bent over in agony , swaying . He gripped his stomach . Blood was flowing from his nose down onto his shirt , dripping onto the sidewalk . He swayed and shuddered and yet seemed to be gathering strength for another lunge at Jesse . " Do n't do it ! I 'll kill you ! " Jesse whispered.  | But he ran at Jesse again , hardly able to straighten himself . This time he managed to get his big arms around Jesse in a tight , strangling hold , but Jesse pushed himself free  --  Trick 's strength suddenly gave out and he staggered backwards , his fist pressed against his chest . He cried out in pain . His legs buckled . He fell heavily onto the sidewalk . " I told you  --  I told you ! " Jesse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : the smell of panic about Jesse 's body , his cold body . His head felt hollow and cold . Jesse sitting in a cheap chair of metal tubing , with foamrubbercushion , waiting . Helene with him , holding his hand , loweringher head wearily until she pressed her forehead against his knuckles ; he gave a little jump when he saw her so docile , so close to him . In public . He was very sleepy ... . The resident on the floor told Jesse to go home . But Jesse wanted to wait , he had to wait . Was Trick going to live ? " It was n't your fault , " Helene whispered . It was n't his fault , but Cady had called an attorney at once . The man was brisk and unconversational . This Sunday-evening emergencydispleased him . He kept asking about the witnesses : yes , there were three witnesses apart from Helene , three men willing to testify . Good . Jesse remembered that blow in the stomach  --  his knee rising hard right into Trick  --  Did the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes . Did he insist upon a fight ? Yes . Had he been provoked in any way ? No . Not in any way ? No . Did you know about his heart condition ? No . A rheumatic heart condition  --  he never mentioned it to you ? Never ? No . Jesse jumping up , his blood coursing through him  --  rage bursting in him  --   |p281You  repeatedly told Dr. Monk to leave you alone ... ? Yes . " He was the one who wanted to fight . He insisted upon fighting Jesse , " Helene said . She was fired with a strange energy , leaning forward from the hips to look intently at the attorney , declaring herself . A certain ferocity , an air of ownership , gave her tired face a keen , girlish look . To Jesse she said , " He wanted you to fight him so that you would kill him . I understand it now . He wanted you to kill him . " Jesse rubbed his eyes as if to get this clear . But he could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand . I understand it now , " Helene said . She waited in the hospital with him , holding his hand . She would marry him at once ; they would get married at once . Why should they wait until Jesse 's intern year was over ? Why ? She knew what it would be like to be an intern 's wife , it would be no surprise to her , the daughter and granddaughter of doctors  --  Yes , they must get married soon , in a week or two . She would never leave him . Those first running steps of Trick 's . . . the clumsy wrestling embrace . . . Jesse 's knee brought up into his belly . . . . She comfortedhim . He wanted to weep , she was so close to him and so public , so loving , so angry for him . She would never leave him . " Why would he want to die ? " Jesse asked her . " He wanted you to kill him . " " But why ? Why ? " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to kill him ? " It was the same question the attorney had asked . Why would this young man want you to hurt him ? Why would he deliberately provoke you when he had a weak heart ? Jesse 's face was turning into a muscle that yearned to show pain , intense pain . He wanted to cry . But he did not allow himself to cry . Trick was dying , who would cry for Trick ? Sparkling protoplasm : Trick . Drowning . We are drowning , Trick had said . Jesse had not understood the poem and now he could not remember it . The words were jumbled . Protoplasm ... lovers . . . lovers pressed together in daylight ... No , he did not understand.  |p282A  balloon , flimsy and transparent . There is something terrifyingabout it . It floats upon a background of darkness , a universe of darkness , pinpricked by tiny dots of light . They are like stars . They are hardly more than suggestions of light . The balloon does not move but looks as if it might move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breathe upon it , surely it would float away ? No , it does not float away . Pass your fingers near it lightly , not touching it . What are those grainy lines ? They are like pencil lines . Like hairs . They seem about to lift themselves , to rise to the warmth of your fingers . But they do not move . The balloon itself is motionless , as if dormant for centuries . You can see through it , yet there is nothing behind it . Along its edges there are long thin lesions , as if someone had torn into the flesh of this thing with a knife . You can run your fingernail along the edge of the balloon and destroy it , and your fingernail springs into the microscope 's lens like a planet ... . Helene was staring through Jesse 's microscope . It was an enormous , costly instrument that her father had given him . She was alone in the apartment ; it was five-thirty in the morning and Jesse was on duty at the hospital for the second night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had wandered through the apartment with her robe tied tightly around her . She had turned on the light in Jesse 's study and was leaning over the microscope , her arms folded . She did not adjust the lens because that would mean she had been looking through the microscope , that she had been in Jesse 's study  --  a small back room hardly large enough for a child 's room . She did not want him to know she 'd been in here . He would come home exhausted , glance in at his things , and sense that she had been here . . . . She wanted to keep herself separate from him ; she felt a strange , almost angry fascination with the need to be separate from her husband . She loved him and understood that he loved her , yet she must retain this separateness . . . . How strange it was , this thing beneath the microscope 's lens !  --  a filmy balloon , transparent cellulose , an enormous sun , an ocean of light , a face without featuresHelene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hisp283desk  --  notes on patients , magazines , journals , a glossy offprint of an article by her father , originally published in a neurological journal . Jesse 's things were kept in careful piles , in order , papers clipped together and staggered along the edge of his desk so that he could see in an instant what was what . Helene felt a peculiar , heady excitement at the possibility of destroying this order  --  but she put everything back in place again . It was early September . Jesse had been on the intern staff at LaSalle for two months now . His first assignment was in Medicine and he had one more month to go ; he worked as Helene had known he would have to work , returning home stunned with fatigue , hollow-eyed , twitching and murmuring in his sleep . There he relived his first failures . Helene lay awake and tried to comfort him as he slept , knowing that her calm would have to serve for both of them . Loving him , pitying him , she stroked his damp forehead , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muscles gathered themselves up into an expression of anguish ; it was so brutal and so useless , whatever frightened him . What good did it do ? What was he reliving ? She imagined him hurrying through the corridors of the hospital , being paged as Dr. Vogel , Dr. Vogel , a man in a dream . She imagined that half second of utter blackness as he picked up a telephonereceiver to answer the call : lifting the receiver like that was like stepping into space . He brought home news of the bad cases , the nasty surprises . Other news  --  patients who did well , were released , vanished back into the city  --  had no interest for him . He kept talking to her of his mistakes , his near-mistakes , his failures . He had Emergency Room duties every two weeks , when he was on twenty-four-hour call and had to stay at the hospital . Anything could happen then . It must have been the gelatinous air of late summer in Chicago , the murky humid nights , the teasing air of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bizarre accidents  --  mangled automobiles wrapped together , workmen falling through the air , skulls split by playful gestures . Jesse 's hands could not work fast enough , his mind could not take in all these people . Once he came home and asked Helene to lie down with him , to hold him . He wept . He told her about a child brought into Emergency : a two-year-old with a wreck of a body , , bruises and welts everywhere , one eye hammered shut and probably destroyed by tiny hemorrhages , ribs cracked , several fingers broken . Jesse shut his eyes tight and rubbed his face against Helene , weeping , surrendering his consciousness to hers , as if trying to impregnate her with his horror so that he could sleep . She had tried to comfort him but had no words to use . Now , in his place , she found it difficult to sleep . Jesse stayed at the hospital two nights every week , in a stifling room in the interns ' quarters . At home , Helene thought of him constantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things on his desk as if to evoke another , more studious Jesse , a man not harassed and overcome with disasters ; she stared out the window , she wandered listlessly about the empty apartment . She could sleep only a few hours every night . Jesse could sleep anywhere now . He could sleep in the hospitalcafeteria , putting his head down on his arms for a five-minute nap . When he woke he would be as refreshed , he claimed , as if he 'd slept an hour . He could doze leaning against a wall . He could sleep in a telephone booth while he was calling Helene , waiting for her to pick up the phone ; dozing off suddenly , completely , so that when she answered the call , she was connected to nothing , latched onto nothing . " Is that you , Jesse ? " she would cry , her voice rising in alarm . But she never spoke of her loneliness or her bitterness . The other interns ' wives complained constantly , angrily surprised by what they had contracted for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never said aloud what seemed so clear : that it had been a mistakefor them to marry so soon . Her father had tried to talk them out of it , and in private he had told Helene what she would have to endure . But she had insisted . She had to marry him , must marry him . Trick 's collapse had terrified him . He had needed her , he had been mute with fear , needing her . . . she had had to marry him , to comfort him . . . . And Trick had not died . So in the end her father had agreed with her reluctantly , and then sternly , possessively , gave her money and commanded her to use it . Never mind telling Jesse about it , her father had said . Jesse 's life is too complicatedat this time for him to be worried about money . As an intern , Jesse received little salary . Helene worked part-time in the chemistrydepartment at the University of Chicago , and she exaggerated the amount of her pay so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The checks came every two weeks . Sometimesp285there was a brief letter with them , hardly more than a commandment  --  Telephoneme collect on Sunday , please  --  sometimes nothing . She floated between them , her father and her husband . They seemed to have no real consciousness of her except as a point of contact , an object , a beloved object . She would telephone her father obediently and sense her soul straining out to him across the distance , as if she wanted nothing more than to leap back into his life . . . the study with the watermarked ceiling , the antiques , the heavy-framed paintings , the Victorian home in Cambridge where she had spent most of her life . But did she really want that ? Her head swam . No , she wanted Jesse , her husband . She wanted him to lie in her arms and speak gently to her of love , she wanted to feel herself separate from him and yet linked to him by the careful articulation of his love , not this nullity of fear and passion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as if secretly , hastily , before falling asleep . It was one act among many he had to perform . He was responsible for so much , he had to act swiftly , skillfully , and then he had to fall heavily asleep so that he could wake up again strong enough to get through another day . It was heavy , the burden of his love ! It was stifling , unnatural . Helene felt his anguish passing over into her , into the pit of her belly , where she was vulnerable to him , open and unresisting . There was always some spare horror he left her with : In the baby 's excrement there were all these worms . . . . So he slept while she lay awake , stunned . Her skin prickled with his sorrow . It was a presence in bed with them that she must keep at a distance , Helene alone , protecting Jesse while he slept . ... She checked the microscope again . That balloon . It was like a mouth , a mouth without a body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Was it dead or living ? Were any of these cells really dead ? She swayed above Jesse 's desk , lightheaded at the thought of the crowd of cells that surrounded her and were inside her , which could never really die and which were invisible . Invisible energy . She herself , Helene herself , was made up of such cells and nothing else . . . . If she had the baby Jesse so strangely , desperately wanted , she would erupt into a cluster of new cells leaping out of hers , newer , richer , brighter energy pushing out of the nullity of her womb ... .  |p286Her  father had made the appointment for her , telephoning all the way from Cambridge . Today at eleven . To make sure she would go , he himself had called to make the appointment with a man he had known for many years , a Chicago obstetrician and gynecologist . Today at eleven . And now it was twenty-five minutes to six , a September morning . Already hot . Helene straightened Jesse 's desk-top so that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as if she had just had another of those quiet arguments with Jesse : How can you want me to have a baby ? At this time in our lives ? Or with her father : Why do you keep telling me to make Jesse do this , do that ? Fiercely , she would defend her husband against her father . She would not talk Jesse into coming East . No . Though she wanted to return to Boston herself , she would not press Jesse . No application for a research position . No application for a grant . She did not really want Jesse to be a doctor , a practicing doctor ; she hated the thought of his running a big clinic someday ; but she would not try to argue with him . She told her father that he must not ask her to argue , he must leave her marriage alone . With Jesse , she defended her separateness , her crystalline , frightened body : why could n't he understand how bad an idea it was to have a baby now ? Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bitter , inevitable ripeness her body had to suffer ? And then she would be a mother for life . For life . She did not want to be a mother . She was frightened . She did not want to enter that new state , to be delivered over into that new condition for a lifetime . . . . Mrs. Vogel , a mother . Her father did not seem to listen to her and Jesse did not seem to listen to her . They talked at her . They talked at her and then went about the business of their lives , which had little to do with her . She went out into the small kitchen and heated water for coffee . She lit a cigarette . Since coming to Chicago she had begun to smoke , though Jesse disapproved and she herself did not like the look of people smoking . Her forehead wrinkled sharply at the thought of women smoking , pregnant women smoking , pregnant bellies . . . . No , it was too ugly . It was impossible . She could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and somber , it had no glow to it , no resiliency . She had become acquainted with the young wife of one of Jesse 's residents in Medicine . The residents , like the interns , received little pay . And yet this woman was pregnantp287and her face and body were hearty , almost arrogant with health , and she expressed only scorn for the reprimands given her by her family . Her name was Susan ; her husband , Milton Kuzma , seemed to think highly of Jesse . Milton said of Jesse : " They 're not going to break him . " And this was meant to be a compliment . They 're not going to break him . Helene stared out the kitchen window . She wondered if she would he broken . What did that mean , to be broken ? She kept seeing Trick collapsing to the sidewalk , his legs giving out . . . . Hewas in a private hospital in Minnesota now . She kept seeing , halfseeing , the patients Jesse spoke of when he came home especially saddened , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ghostly strangers , all pleading for attention . Helene stared out the window , feeling herself very much alone . Their apartment was on the fourth story of an aged brownstone building not far from the hospital . The neighborhood was decaying : big , handsome , ruined buildings with tall windows and doors and columns , front stoops that flared outward to the street , everything dirty and weatheredand very human , so that Helene wanted to stop on the street at times to stare , to memorize . The buildings had been handsome at one time . Ridged with scrollwork , with odd eroded animals and human heads , even their chimneys impressive . Their spirit stern , masculine . Now they were marked for extinction . Some were already razed , and you could sec the marks of stairways on walls that still stood ; the vcinlike marks of pipes ; the places where wires had been torn out or hung dangling like exposed nerves . Negro children played in the rubble . A few lots had already been cleared and bulldozers had covered the gutted valleys with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new construction . Smaller buildings remained , like the one in which Jesse and Helene lived , and other brownstones that were two family houses . The air of the street was excited and dusty on any weekday  --  always a sense of wonderment , the surprise of walls about to collapse , bricks about to crumble , Always the dull heavy half-pleasant rhythm of a weight striking something . The workmen would arrive at eight o'clock and begin work at once . Pounding , breaking , the high sharp angry buzz of machines , the churning of great wheels in soft earth . . . . The Kuzmas lived only a half a block away , on a side street . Their apartment was smaller than Helene and Jesse 's , closer to the demolition work . Susan would sit and press her hands against her stomach , frowning , and complain about the noise . The vibrations . She hated the noise but Helene secretly liked it because it was not human . Jesse and Milton did n't notice it , they had n't time for such things . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noise , not like the shrieks and footsteps in this old building that brought the faceless tenants too close to her , inflicted an intimacy on her that she did not want . When she was alone in the apartment , which was often , she tried to concentrate on the distant noise , the heavy reliablenoise of machinery , in order to blot out from her consciousness this nearer , more disturbing noise . A father yelling at his son . . . a child 's scream of frustration . . . women yelling perpetually at children , as if these children were still bound to their bodies by some frantic , agonizing strand of flesh . It was not possible that she was pregnant ... . All her life she had felt wild rushes of expectation and fear . To be a woman . A wife . You needed a man to complete you ; that was obvious . In order to be a woman , a wife . She had been afraid to think about love , about loving a man , because it had seemed to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about it the way she resisted thinking about death . It was too ugly . She had grown up with a dislike of being touched , even by her parents . Yet she knew she must be touched eventually She must be touched , loved , completed by a man and made over into a woman . A woman : a wife . She wanted to be loved but to be separate and suspended , inside the idea of love , so that the man might exist in a part of her mind , chastely . Always she had feared her body . Her mother had referred to certain things obliquely , with a curt clipped shame  --  her father had never referred to them at all  --  and Helene had grown up with a resistance to them , to the thought of them , and to her own body with its helpless flesh . What did that mean exactly , to have a body ? To live in a body ? Did she inhabit her body like a tenant ? She imagined her body as a substance of a certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so it did not seem possible that a man , a man 's body , might freely enter her own and do such damage to it . . . . Layer upon layer the years formed her : Helene was now a married woman , the same age as her husband , and yet she was also nineteen years old , she was twelve years old again , she was a child.  |p289All  the layers were intense , quivering , conscious of existing . Consciousof being female , a little ashamed of being female . Susan Kuzma showed no shame about anything . She talked about her bladder irritation in front of anyone , had made up a kind of joke about the humiliation of a gynecological examination at the hospital . Helen listened in amazement . It hardly seemed possible that another woman could speak of such things . She could never have spoken that way herself . Never . She was suspended in a fearful , cautious state , cautious especially of Jesse 's love , as if surrenderingto him would infect her with that coarse blatant bodiliness she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dreading the ugly shower stall and its perpetualsmell . But it was one of the things she must do every day . The drain was rusty and always clogged with hairs and soap , though she cleaned it often . Jesse showered at both the hospital and at home , and every time he showered he washed his hair . Soap came apart in his fingers , he must have used it so brutally . He brought home from the hospital the habit of scrubbing himself hard , for many minutes . The hospital was so contagious . . . and else himself , his hands , was so contagious ... . Yes , small bits of soap were caught in the drain this morning and Helene bent to pick them out one by one . When she got dressed the workmen had begun their pounding . Great weights seemed to fall from the sky upon solid , resisting masses . It was eight o'clock , and by eleven she would be in the waitingroom of her father 's friend . He would decide her fate . It had nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father 's wishes . Jesse gathering her up in his arms , breathless , in that instant before his mind blacked out .. . . But now it had nothing to do with him . The doctor would examine her , he would test her , and then he would tell her what had happened to her . To her body . Jesse knew nothing about this . Tonight he would spend the night here and she would have to tell him . He would bring home with him the faint sorrowful odor of sickness , a two days ' duty on seven floors of a hospital ; he would pass his hands over his eyes and whisper , " My God , there are some people I 've gotten to hate . . . , " and she would feel the tension in him , that he should admit to such an emotion : Jesse , who rarely hated . Then , with an effort , he would ask her about herself . How was her job ? Exhausted , he would try to talk to her as if she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her sickness a mystery . It would take probing , prying , to discover what was wrong with her . It would take all his youthful shrewdness . But a certain wavering of his gaze would tell Helene that he was about to collapse , and so she would lead him gently to bed , like a child , while he tried to talk with her , shaking his head to stay awake . It had happened so many times .... Sometimes Jesse went for thirty-six hours without sleeping when he was on duty . His eyes were ringed with exhaustion and he had lost weight . But he never complained except to tell Helene in amazement that he hated someone , or had lost track of a patient , or had been cut down by one of the staff , or had made a mistake . But these were not really complaints . Jesse seemed to contemplate himself , Dr. Vogel , as if this person were a stranger , without emotions . There was no time for emotions . Jesse , a husband , sometimes seemed to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he owed it to his young wife to display them . But really there was no time . She would lead him to bed and lie beside him , holding him in her arms , and he would sink into a sudden stuporous sleep . Sometimes he ground his jaws . Sometimes he seemed to be arguing inaudibly . Helene would whisper , " Jesse , you 're home . You 're in bed . " But still his muscles twitched , his eyeballs moved behind his closed eyes . What was he struggling with ? Helene had a dim view of people running in the hospital 's corridors  --  Jesse among them , running  --  Sometimes he said out loud , " The elevator is stuck , " or " Where is the light ? " Helene wanted to sleep that night , so she went out to a drugstore to get some pills . Ordinary sleeping pills , the kind sold over the counter . She had never taken anything stronger because she had never wanted to ask her father for a prescription ; she had n't wanted him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had made a great deal of money on several types of barbiturates he had patented , so this seemed a further reason to resist taking them . In the drugstore she hesitated over several brands of pills . She imagined the pharmacist was watching her closely . Her fingers were trembling a little . Yes , they were trembling , and at the front counter , where she paid for the pills , a woman clerk seemed to feel sorry for her . There must have been some meager , helpless sorrow on her face.  |p291She  walked out with a jar of one hundred pink pills . The entire day belonged to her . She could telephone Dr. Blazack and cancel the appointment . It would only take a minute . Then she could drive downtown and around the city aimlessly , or she could drive out along the lake , anywhere , in the car her father had given her and Jesse back in Ann Arbor . Her wrist watch was small and delicate . It had been her mother's. f the face was a tiny oval , its numbers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bracelet , a lacy interweaving of threads of white gold . Only ten-thirty . She had been up since five-thirty that morning , waiting for eleven o'clock to come , her face going hard and ironic at the knowledge that it would come so slowly . She held her watch up to her ear to see if it was ticking . The dots had the look of being blind . She wondered what time meant , why she was sitting here in this strange city , a city she did n't know or like , why she was beginning to fill with a cold sick panic , why she had married and had completed herself . She was a woman now , a wife . She was completed ; if she was pregnant she would be completed . It would be a sign of how a man had completed her . She stared at her watch and saw that time moved very slowly . That anonymous jellyfish , that balloon , its lesions and hairs and flimsy stubborn transparency ... . She decided to drive downtown now . She had always wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the university . She and Jesse had planned to explore it together , but Jesse had never had time . He said he liked to walk , but he never had time to walk . In Cambridge , Helene and her father had often gone for long walks on Sunday . They had also walked a great deal in Ann Arbor ; in fact , it had been on one of their weekend walks that Helene had met Jesse . Someone had called " Dr. Cady ! " and they had turned to see a tall young man , red-haired , very fair in the face and yet not pale with that sickly paleness of some red-haired people , dressed in old clothes , a certain quick urgency to his step that alarmed Helene  --  for it had seemed to her , in the first few seconds ' confusion , that he had called out to warn her father of some danger . But it was only a student , a medical student . He was polite , frank , a little nervous . Helene , staring at him , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this was the kind of man she had never been able to confront calmly  --  she had never felt herself equal to such a man ; she had always turned away shyly , withdrawing . He had an excited , intelligent , attractive face . It was obvious that he was intimidated by her father , and yet he spoke clearly and frankly . There was something new about him , something very new , unique , that startled this young man himself as if with its audacity , as if he were creating himself as he talked , inventing himself . That day he had seemed to Helene too vigorous . A threat . She had turned away from him slightly , distrusting him . She would go into the city alone , she would walk there alone . At the back of her mind she imagined herself walking all day , losing herself in the city . Jesse warned her about walking around by herself . Chicago was dangerous , he said . He told her of a woman brought into the emergency ward , raped and then slashed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effort of fighting off an assailant  --  how she had fought Jesse himself , believing him to be her assailant . The enemy . Men are the enemy . Even in this old dress of hers , with her flat-heeled shoes , Helene might attract the attention of men who yearned for women , for the blood of women ; why not ? It was possible . There were many such men in a city this large . In the world . Helene 's legs looked bare because her stockings were so sheer .... What , it was still ten-thirty ? Dr. Blazack 's office was in a high , attractive building on the Drive . Helene was grateful for that . She wanted nothing to do with LaSalle or with its harassed interns and residents . Thank God her father had money ! Dr. Blazack was one of the obstetrics men whom other doctors scorned and envied , a rich man , with a practice of rich women . She must go to him because her father had made an appointment for her : there was no way out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lake  --  the air lifted neutrallyfrom it , very humid . Helene entered Dr. Blazack 's suite of offices and her eye jumped nervously about the sofas and the tall " modern " lamps . A woman in a maternity dress looked up from a magazine at Helene , as if ready to recognize her , but Helene looked quickly away . She sat . A nurse came out to greet her as if she were an old friend . " Mrs. Vogel . . . ? Please come in here with me . " She had a small , neat office of her own , where she asked Helene questions for the doctor'sp293records . These questions already marked Helene as a patient of his . ... Her heart began to accelerate , anticipating the examination . She hated to be examined . Hated to be touched . " How long have you been married , Mrs. Vogel ? " " Since July . " " Oh , only since July ? " the nurse said sweetly . Helene was released and went back to the waiting room . Another nurse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Helene watched their legs as they walked away : the nurse 's were muscular and gauzy in white stockings , the patient 's legs were trim and fashionable . A young woman , as young as Helene . She glanced involuntarily at her own legs and saw that she was only a woman among women , after all . A women 's body among women 's bodies . Jesse had already helped deliver babies at the hospital . She picked up a magazine but could not read . Could not concentrate on anything . She tried to make her mind go hard and precise ; tried to think of the angles of this room , which were more real than the lamps and the sofas and the expensive carpeting . The room was a box that could not be disguised . A third nurse appeared  --  a girl of about twenty  --  and called her by name . " Mrs. Vogel ? " I Icicne followed her into a hack corridor , where fluorescent lights hummed dimly . An odor of plastic and tile . " Dr. Blazack will he with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a whisper . Helene sat down Again numbly . This was the doctor 's own office  --  he had an extremely large oval desk ; there were costly lithographs on two walls and one large window looked out onto the lake . Someone was washing his hands nearby . Water splashed . How many times a day did he have to wash his hands , this doctor ? Jesse lingered in the shower for ten , fifteen minutes , as if afraid he could n't get clean .... On a table near the big desk were piles of letters and magazinesand advertisements . Helene could see the glossy cover of a popular science magazine , a photograph of a cell . A photograph blown up so that the cell was enormous , magnified more fiercely than the cell under Jesse 's microscope . Behind Helene , in the lavatory , faucets were being shut off briskly . The door opened and she looked around . " Well , Mrs. Vogel ! How are you this morning ? " Dr. Blazack was a fairly old man , she saw . Small , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a perfect off-white shade , exactly the color of real teeth . He smelled of soap . Helene recognized him not in himself but in the form of a certain kind of doctor , friends of her father 's , who were successful and kindly and in perpetual joyful motion like her father . His hands were pinkened as if with a fresh surge of blood . " No need to look so tense , my dear . It 's a lovely day and no one is going to hurt you , " he said gently . " First , I want to ask you about your father , if you do n't mind . How is he ? It 's been ten years  --  at least ten years !  --  since I 've seen Benjamin face to face  --  " And so she spoke dutifully of her father . Dr. Blazack smiled brightly , nodded at her recitation , sighed as if in envy of Benjamin Cady 's life ; it was the courtesy of a wealthy obstetrician for a man of pure science . In his turn he talked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends . Helene doubted this . Her father had had no close friends . Helene pretended to agree but her mind wandered nervously . The magazine with its slick black-and-white cover seemed to shimmer . Protoplasm that was about to come to life  --  like jelly , like a balloon . Helene had examined thousands of cells under slides . Smears of cells . Jesse , in the pathology labs in which he 'd worked , had gotten practice at examining cells of all kinds . The universe might open up into a snowstorm of cells . . . . Living units . Dead units . And yet the dead units were perhaps not really dead . Nothing dies . Nothing dies permanently  --  was that a law of physics ? Life in each cell , like grit , like a grain of sand in the eye that ca n't be annihilated . The cell shrivels down to this pinprick of life . . . or perhaps it goes mad and starts dividing , multiplying , blowing itself up into a balloon-sized tumor ... . " I think I 'm pregnant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Blazack smiled as if he had never heard such a statement before . Now he opened a folder , picked up a pen , prepared to take notes . The nurse had given him Helene 's folder . Already she was a patient of his , in his records . " When was your period due , Helene ? " he asked . Helene was staring at his hands . Women fell in love with their obstetricians , she knew . Nine months of love . Their doctors became the true fathers of their babies . Their doctors became their true fathers , for nine months . " I do n't remember . . . , " she whispered.  | " You do n't remember ? " he asked in surprise . " I think . . . I think it was two weeks ago , two or three weeks ago ... . She was silent . He must have thought this was strange ; he smiled sternly at her . Then , looking at a calendar on his desk , he said cheerfully , " Ah , yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If it was two weeks ago ? " " Yes , yes .... " " Or was it three weeks ago ? " She stared in silence at his hands . After an awkward pause Dr. Blazack said , " I 'll examine you and then arrange for you to take the test . How does that sound ? " " All right . " " No need to look so nervous , Helene ! You know better than that . There is never any point in worrying about anything , in assuming anything . . . . Wait until we see the results of the test . " " Yes , I know . " " Any hospital will run the test for you . Did you say your husband was at LaSalle ? " She had not told him this ; he must have learned it from her father . But she nodded anyway . " There 's really no need to look so worried ! " Helene tried to smile . One of the nurses rapped softly on the opened door . " Dr. Illazack , Dr. Brant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Dr. Blazack made a gesture of helplessness , sighed , gave in and picked lip the telephone . " Hello . . . ? I ca n't hear you . Oh , yes . When ? ' Tomorrow ? But I did n't think he would be willing to sell so soon ... what about the highway commission ? What happened ? .. . Well , then tomorrow ? At two ? " Tomorrow at two everything will be changed , Helene thought . She could still leave . She could get out of here , run out onto the street , out loose in the streets of Chicago . She could lose herself in ! lie crowds , walking freely in the crowds . No one would know her . tier heels hard on the pavement . Inside her , that warm little core would not be dislodged . . . she would walk fast and rap her heels on the sidewalks . . . she would feel the warmth spreading up through her , a radiance that could not be dislodged.  | Dr. Blazack stood and closed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nurse reappeared and escorted Helene into the examinationroom . Helene 's heart was pounding . The room smelled of new fresh leather . At the sight of the table Helene felt something move inside her , in her loins . Was it the start of a flow ? The beginning of blood ? " I think . . . I think maybe ... , " she stammered . The nurse smiled at her . " Yes , Mrs. Vogel ? " But nothing . Of course not . " Nothing . " The nurse 's face was bright with efficiency . What was this room , Helene thought dizzily , why was she here ? A young man had called out her father 's name . . . . And here was the examination table with its stirrups . All women are equal on that table , their heels caught in those stirrups . All women are the same woman . The nurse was opening drawers deftly  --  she was arranging instruments on a tray . She drew a length of clean white paper up over the examination table . " Would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nurse said . Ilelene came numbly to life . She sensed the nurse 's bewilderment . Why was she so stiff , so frightened ? It was not normal . All of Dr. Blazack 's patients were beaming with life , grateful to be pregnantand to be his patients . Normal women . And so Helene stepped forward , feeling a kind of power in herself . A bitter dark power . She would be examined on that table , she would feel pain , and this pain was necessary . She deserved it . Her body deserved it , after what Jesse had done to it . She had lain in that man 's arms , obedient to his demands , though she had feared pregnancy and had feared Jesse himself . She had allowed him to make love to her . She had violated herself . Now she would lie down again , on her back , for another man . Lie down . Lie down . She was naked now , wearing only a coarse white smock that was too large for her . It tied loosely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table and the paper rattled beneath her like tin . The nurse , courteous and sweet as a sister , said , " Could you slide down farther , Mrs. Vogel ? " Helene fixed her bare heels in the stirrups at the end of the table . She slid down awkwardly . " Just a little farther , please . A little farther . "  |p297The  nurse spread her legs . One small palm on each of Helene 's knees , spreading them . Now everything in her was open . The nurse drew a white cloth over her , up to her waist . She might have been covering a corpse . " That 's fine , Mrs. Vogel . The doctor will be right with you . " Women lay with their legs apart like this every day . Helene looked at the window opposite her through her eyelashes . It was rimmed with eerie light  --  dark light  --  the sky outside had clouded over . In Chicago light changed rapidly . You could not trust the sun . It was hard for her to remember that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chicago . She was married now . Her father had arranged for this examination and so she was in good hands . In good hands . Time would stop now . The ticking of that relentless little watch would stop . And then , later , when the examination was over , the watch would begin again . . . . She would rush out of here when the examination was over and disappear into the city . Thousands of women disappeared into the city . She would go to Kresge 's and buy a knitting needle  --  or did they come only in pairs ? She would take a room in a hotel and use that metal knitting needle on herself , the way girls used knitting needles on themselves ... . Dr. Blazack entered the room quietly . He was fatherly and holy . lie said , " This wo n't hurt . It will only take a few minutes . " That was evidently his style ; he made his patients ashamed of feeling pain , so that they would bear pain in silence rather than disappoint him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now a quick , peeling sound  --  flesh against something slippery  --  hemust have been putting on his rubber gloves . The young nurse stood beside him , taller than he . Helene did not dare open Iicr eyes to really look at them . If the pupils of her eyes flashed open she might scream . Between her legs , in that magic space , something flashed . The nurse was dabbing something on her . An odor of chemicals , disinfectant . . . she was being cleaned and made ready for him . The sound of instruments on a tray , rattling . Dr. Blazack said something she could not hear . " This will only take a few minutes , Helene . " Then he inserted the instrument . It was very cold and sharp . Helene tried not to move , she willed herself to lie still . But somethinghappened and she recoiled.  | " I 'm sorry , " she said . She forced herself back to the edge of the table . " It should n't hurt , Helene . You 've been examined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think I 'm pregnant .... " That answer did not seem to mean anything . " I think I 'm pregnant , " she said . " If you could slide down again , please , Mrs. Vogel ... , " the nurse said . " I think I 'm pregnant , I . . . , " Helene said wildly . " Do you want the examination to continue ? " Dr. Blazack said . " Yes . Yes . " She prepared herself again . Clumsily , brutely , she slid back down and let her knees fall apart . Dr. Blazack took hold of her knees firmly and spread them farther . When the instrument was inserted in her this time she kept herself still . Now he began to open it . Twisting it open . She forced herself to lie still . Absolutely still . She could not remember this man 's name . A man of late middle age , a stranger , with this thing stuck inside her body . It was metallic and sharp . Now he was opening it , spreading her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the instrument turned and expanded . It was like a circle of nothing , expanding , opening her and turning her inside out . I did n't want . . . this is a mistake ... . She began to breathe quickly . Someone might have been pressing a hand up and down on her chest , pumping her lungs . On the edge of the table her hands clenched and unclenched . The leather had become damp ; it was slippery against her fingers . How could everything in her be so exposed now ? The most secret veins of her body were open to the air of this impersonal room . Her head began to move , slowly at first , from side to side . She could not stop it . No . No . She did not want this thing inside her , she did not want a baby , she did not want a husband , she did not want to be completed . . . . " What does it mean ? " she muttered , not knowing what she said . The clamp was cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bracelet inside her , exposing her . Her body began to contract . She could not stop it . Her womb wanted to shrink back , hide itself . The secret parts of her body were drawing together in terror . Her knees came together hard  --   | " No , please , Mrs. Vogel , " a man said in surprise . He gripped her knees and spread them apart again . She was trying to lie still but her heart had begun to pound wildly . Sweat on her face , under the heavy coils of her hair , which had come loose . A flash of heat shot upward from the cold dark between her legs , that open darkness , telling her she would die . She was going to die . It would come to her like this , the insertion of an instrument , opening her and turning her inside out , the dark heat rising to her heart with the ferocity of loveShe began to struggle . " Mrs. Vogel  --  you 'll hurt yourself  --  " The nurse seized her hands . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be stopped . The table rattled . Something came loose  --  one of the stirrups . Helene felt herself recoiling backward on the table , away from that instrument , but it came along with her , inside her , hurting her . . . . She saw a wild , black space , open to the light and its veins pounding , something not meant to be seen . This strange man could see it . Jesse could see it . The rim of that instrument was like intense searing light . She heard herself screaming . The doctor was saying something to her . He was giving instructions . Helene threw her head from side to side . She could hear nothing . Why was this man talking to her ? There was something stuck up inside her body , a terrible bright pain , and this man was trying to talk to her ! She could kill him ! " Mrs. Vogel  --  " Her smock was bunched up beneath her body . The muscles in her legs fought . She screamed . Another jerk of her body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The thing was out . Gone . Still she threw herself from side to side . Her head struck the table ; her cheeks hot against the leather , which felt like a cheek itself . Faces against faces . All of them sweaty and slippery . So Jesse , her husband , had slapped himself against her , his face grinding against hers in the dark , so he had entered her body with his own , his flesh into her flesh , marrying them . No .... And suddenly she saw a young woman lying on a table . Herself , p 300 contorted like that : a woman on a table , on her back , her face twisted and demented . She had fallen from a great height and her face was twisted permanently . " Mrs. Vogel . . . ? " What was that raw reddened gap between her legs ? So vivid it sucked all the air into it  --  the entire white sky might be drawn into it and lost  --  a face more powerful than her own face , a raw demandingmouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not my name !  --  " She sat up , weeping . Alone with the nurse . Had she frightened the nurse ? The doctor had left . Two women alone in this room , both frightened . Helene could not understand what had happened . " You hurt yourself , it 's bleeding .... Here , wait .... " She fussed with something , not looking at Helene . Helene caught a glimpse of a wad of cotton with a smear of fresh blood on it . " You could have hurt yourself badly , " the nurse said . Helene forced herself to stop crying . She took long , slow , deliberatebreaths to calm herself . " I 'm sorry , " she said . She tried to get up . Her legs were shaky . " He did n't finish the examination ? " she asked . " I 'm afraid not . " The nurse handed her a tissue and she wiped her wet face . " Are you feeling better now ? " " Yes . Yes . I 'm sorry I lost control of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prim face . She had disappointedthis girl . Left alone , Helene dressed quickly . She threw the white gown onto a chair and saw with disgust that it was streaked with blood . There was nothing for her to think now ; she stood in a kind of vacuum , dressed for the street , ready to escape . In one of her university courses she had studied physical defects that sometimes accompanied retardation  --  children without arms , without legs , some of them even without faces  --  and she had thought , staring in a chilled fascination at the photographs , There is nothing to think about these children . Thinking demanded a space that could be entered  --  you stepped forward into that space , pushing other thingsp301out of the way , claiming a victory , a territory . In a vacuum you could not move one way or another . Everything was transparent and eternal . There was nothing to think . An eternity in the body of a woman : the explosion of small , soft , gentle cells , coils of absolute power . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ background of darkness , pinpricked by tiny dots of light . Her flesh still tingled between her legs . It might have been glowing . A tiny burning clot of moisture seeped down . . . Helene took a tissue out of her purse and dabbed between her legs with it . Let it be blood . The start of five days of blood . But when she brought the crumpled tissue back out , careful not to touch her clothes with it , she saw that it was bright blood  --  too bright for menstrual blood . So she stood very still , waiting . The past three weeks had been a nightmare of waiting like this . She would feel something move in her loins , seeping down hotly . . . but it would turn out to be only a vapid colorless moisture , not blood . Mucus . A quarter 's size of dark clotted blood would have redeemed her . But no . No blood . The cycle was not going to end this time . She was already in her second month of pregnancy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in anger , at their satisfied faces : Jesse , I 'm pregnant , are you happy ? Father , I 'm pregnant ! It was a fact that had nothing to do with her personally . It could have been said of any woman , anyone at all . Something was floating lightly , invisibly , inside her . It swam in a cupful of liquid that was its universe , transparent and eternal ... . When she stepped out into the corridor she saw Dr. Blazack himself waiting for her . He was a small man , after all . " Mrs. Vogel , could you step in here for a minute . . . ? " " I 'm leaving . I 'm going home , " she said quickly . " But Mrs. Vogel .... " She hurried out , looking at no one . She had failed . Dr. Blazack would telephone her father , and this evening the telephone would ring and she would have to answer it before Jesse did . Her father . She would have to talk to him . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broken . She must have broken them in her panic , during the examination . She was still tense and contorted . 1ler muscles cringed . She walked awkwardly , aware of the chafing of her thighs , where the insides of her thighs rubbed together . She was very conscious of them touching and wondered why she had never noticed this before . Jesse was always telling her about the bad surprises at the hospital . Things broke , went wrong , collapsed , burst . There were hours of routine work , the filling out of reports , the blood samples , the spinal taps , transfusions , shots , intravenous feedings  --  and then suddenlythere were the surprises , lungs filling suddenly with fluid , lips gone white , blood pressure falling , falling , as arteries somewhere collapsed  --  How did you make sense of such things ? The body is a machine , but the machine sometimes breaks down . It could happen to her : she could pick at the wall of the womb until it broke down into bleeding . She drove along State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the day now . She would find a hotel , rent a room . She would run over to Kresge 's . Then , in the hotel room , she would run hot water in the bathtub and undress and sit in the tub , her legs slowly spreading . She would ease the thing up into herself . Angrily and calmly . Its pressure would be very sharp and very thin , unlike the broad , coarse pressure Jesse brought to her . Pressure . Then a sudden sighing release as the needle sank in . The water pinkening with blood . What she must remember is to leave the tub unplugged and the water on . That way there would be a continual flow of fresh water , splashing and hot . The blood would drain out and new water would rush in and everything would be clean . Noon : a clock advertising tires . Cars and trucks were moving through downtown Chicago steadily , in a constant noisy bustle . The sound of horns . More horns . One lane was blocked off ahead , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an accident . She would have to get into the left lane . She had n't been paying attentionand now she was being drawn into the blocked-off lane , she could n't get out of it . . . a police car was parked there and men stood around . She waited patiently . What she must remember : to keep the hot water running into the tub . After a few minutes she eased into the left lane . Slowly , achingly , the line of traffic drew her onward . What she must remember  --  The traffic light ahead turned from green to red . What did that mean ? She waited until it turned green again . Driving was a strug/gle : she sensed vehicles on all sides of her , about to lunge into her . But when she looked out she saw only cars and trucks with ordinary people in them , their hands gripped like hers on their steering wheels . She braked to a stop suddenly . Then she drove forward again and everything was suspended . She could not remember exactly what she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not forget the bathtub , she would have to scour it first , make sure it was clean , then turn on the hot water . . . very hot water . . . . Behind her , around her , on all sides of her traffic moved onward . It pressed against her and would not let her free . She would scream at Jesse : There are too many people ! I ca n't have a baby in all these people ! Steel knitting needles . She would park the car and abandon it . Run , get into the crowd on the sidewalk , become anonymous . Become protoplasm . But she could not find a place to park . The balloon was inside her , fixed . She was passing drugstores , taverns , shoe stores , pawnshops , liquor stores , clothing stores . Movie houses . Old men loitered on the sidewalkshere , looking around blankly , without judgment . Downtown at noon . These sights confused Helene . She might have intruded upon a sacred landscape , it was so certain , so definite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look of having been here for decades . The people all knew their way around perfectly . Everyone who was here belonged here . They had chosen to come here , walking in slow , measured strides or standing on the sidewalk , motionless , looking around . They had all been born at one time or another , at : c precise moment . If their mothers had tried in desperation to scrape them out and lose them in bathwater they would have resisted  --  would have clutched the walls of flesh and refused to let -o  --  why ? Why should anyone give up life ? Why not fight for it ? There was an army in the womb and it would not die without a light . Helene 's eye was drawn to three young women strolling on the sidewalk  --  flashily dressed , very cheap and pretty , their hair cached and puffed out around their stark , glamorous , high-colored faces  --  how she hated them ! feared them ! Must remember to buy Dutch Cleanser . The tub would probably be dirty . She would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dirt .... She followed the girls with her eye , repulsed by their cheerful sexual glow that was like a beacon shining out of their faces , so obvious , so disgusting , and she thought of the faint line of dirt that formed on the collars of her clothes and Jesse 's shirts after a single wearing . Where did it come from , that dirt ? Clean as she and Jesse were , they were not really clean . She must remember to buy cleanser . Otherwise she would not be able to force herself to sit in that tub . Pedestrians passed close about her , crossing with the light . They walked with their collars turned up against their faces , like Arabs , trying to protect themselves from small whirling clouds of grit and papers . The wind was quite strong today . Their eyes were half-shut , as if with a strange contentment . All of them swelling outward in sacs , their lips thirsty and pressed against the walls of sacs , sucking blood . Nothing could dislodge them . She could not find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heading north toward LaSalle Metropolitan Hospital . She felt herselfdrawn there , the car drawn there . There was something she must do but she could not quite remember it : the bathtub , the Dutch Cleanser , the hot water . Scalding water . People passed in front of her car when she stopped for a red light , walking tirelessly , fiercely . They had the look of city people who have spent all the days of their lives tramping the city streets , up and down , contented , knowing exactly where they were going . Helene feared their strength . She felt lightheaded suddenly , knowing that something was going to happen to her . What she must remember ... . She wanted to stop this car , park it at a curb . Anywhere . She wanted to abandon it . She wanted to run to a telephone booth and call her father and scream at him . I am Helene Cady ! What has happened to me ? I was supposed to grow up into a certain person , but where is that person ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marriage has n't made any difference . . . and now my life is over , I ca n't tell myself that it will happen in the future , I am through waiting for my life to happen . . . . I am everything now , at this moment , that I will ever be . It 's over . She parked in the visitors ' parking lot of the hospital . No moisture between her legs ? No ache in the pit of her belly ? The hospital was a large seven-story building with a broad , sand-blasted facade and scores of windows . It had an old , decrepit , stained look  --  tar seemed to have seeped down from its roofs ; its chimneys werep305enormous and blackened , like the chimneys of factories . The big front lawn was a bright false green , dotted with refuse . A new wing was being added , but work had been temporarily halted and girders were exposed like raw , orange , comically exaggeratedbones . Helene entered the hospital through the big front door . A sound of wheezing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a hospital . Helene went at once to the elevator and took it to the basement , conscious of people milling about her , the bustle of noontime . In the elevator with her were two young doctors , probablyinterns , Jesse 's age , and a small flirtatious nurse , and a woman in expensive street clothes who glanced around hopefully . Helene hurried down to the staff cafeteria . She had met Jesse here a few times . But now she did n't see him , so she sat by herself at a corner table , exhausted , and stared straight ahead of her . Her mind shudderedand went blank . Doctors , young men , passed by her  --  someonewas laughing loudly , with laughter as robust as Trick 's had been ; the men conferred together as if they sensed how everything was in their keeping , everything belonged to them . Their tired , laugh-lined faces , youthful and aged faces , possessed certainty , a power , a maleness that was unconscious in them . Helene stared at them leadenly . Someone touched her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed . " What are you doing here , Helene ? " It was Jesse , as alarmed as she . A man of above-average height : thick red hair , eyes tired and dark in their sockets like her own eyes . Her twin . Her husband . He was a stranger to her , happening upon her like this , one of the many men dressed in white who passed so quickly and so unconsciously about her , hardly glancing at her ; yet he was not a stranger at all but her husband . He had taken hold of her arm , as if in anger . " Is anything wrong ? " Jesse asked , frowning . " No . " He sat down beside her , very close . He stared at her . " I 'm just going to have my breakfast now , I 've been running like hell all day . ... Are you sure nothing is wrong ? " " I had a doctor 's appointment this morning . " " What ? Where ? "  |p306His  face seemed enormous to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of freckles across his forehead . " What do you mean ? " Jesse whispered . His fingers tightened on her arm . It was nearly a convulsion , the way he clutched at her . He knows . It was unmistakable , the way he had come over to her and claimed her . " Jesse , you look so tired , " she said . They stared at each other , their faces hard . Around them , behind them , people milled and bumped against chairs . A man in white sat across from them with a cup of coffee , but Jesse did not look around . He stared at Helene and there was a power , a feverish urgency , in the very bones of his face . She had not wanted it to happen this way . But it had happened : she was here with him , this particular man . They were together . He knew . She leaned her forehead against the edge of his shoulder , the stiff white material of his outfit , and closed her eyes . Exhausted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whispered . She could not speak . She pressed her forehead against this man and everything stopped. 8 " What kind of bleeding ? " " Regular blood . " " But what kind ? Do you pass blood ? " " Nosebleeds . " " Nosebleeds ? " " Yes . Nosebleeds . " Jesse stared at the man and had the idea that he was lying . But why lie ? He wrote down this information . " Bad dreams . I have bad dreams too . " Jesse nodded abstractedly.  | " This old restaurant we used to live over . . . I keep seeing it .. . something about the stairway , my old man . . . . Real bad nightmares . I keep having the same one all the time . . . . They 're all dead now . He spoke with a dull anger . Propped up in bed , his big chest and stomach swelling against the hospital gown , he glared at Jesse as if Jesse were to blame for his trouble . A foxy , cagey look in spite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been hospitalized for uremia . Jesse was making out a report on him hurriedly , and he felt the tension rising between them , a senseless tension , as if this man blamed Jesse for the fact that he was there in bed , sick , while Jesse was making out a report on him . He was a fierce animal in an area marked off sharply by the bedclothes , the exact edges of the bed . " Then since I come here , in the morning , I ca n't get my eyesight right . I will sue if you people are doping me up wrong . Flashes of light in my eyes , like going blind . I know a lawyer and I will sue for all you 've got . " Already it was nine-thirty in the morning and Jesse was behind his schedule . He had to hurry . There was no time to investigate the intimate , cunning , frightened note in this man 's voice ; a curiosity , this notation on his record  --  he was a " professional wrestler , " or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to fat . He wanted to talk to Jesse about his bad dreams , but Jesse was in a hurry and could only nod abruptly , vaguely , thinking of Helene back in the apartment  --  she had been sick again that morning , wretchedly sick , she was now in her seventh month of pregnancy and they were both afraid she might lose the baby , after so many months of misery  --  he had to telephone her as soon as he had a chance , he had run out of the apartment without saying good-by because Helene had n't come out of the bathroom . She had stayed in there as if hiding from him . How could he make sense of this man 's wheedling complaints ? " I can smell myself . I stink . I can smell myself stinking , " the man said angrily . " You are all waiting for me to die . " Jesse hurried to the next patient . An hour behind the schedule he had set for himself . At the back of his mind his wife 's form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this room  --  a woman of thirty-four ' with a very bright , intense , fixed stare . Months ago a stare like hers would have unnerved him ; now it hardly bothered him because he knew he was only a shape in the air that drew out her bitterness , it had nothing to do with him personally . But he kept losing Helene , losing her into the weary drone of the hospital , the sound of the loudspeaker and the squeaking of wheels and the sound of his own voice , asking questions , questions . Nothing came to an end . Little stories began and then broke off abruptly . Nothing was completed , nothing was finished ; he ran out of questions and had to hurry on to the next room . A hard , gleaming skull to this woman ; her hair was very thin . Forehead big , brutal , ominous . She had been hospitalized two days before but there was no diagnosis yet . She continued to stare at Jesse brightly , almost sociably , but she would not answer his questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between them , moving across the woman 's line of vision , but she did not seem to see the nurse . Jesse had to do a spinal tap . His hands went cold . She was going to fight him , going to tear him up  --  he imagined that square , hard mouth of hers opening and the teeth clenching down hard on his wrist . Jesse prepared the needle and observed his hands closely . Not trembling . Not yet . The woman began to whimper as he approached her . A single high shriek . But her body acquiesced , heavy and voluptuous in spite of the white gown she wore ; when it was over she convulsed or pretended to convulse , so that Jesse had to soothe her . " It 's all over . No trouble . All over . " She had been sent to LaSalle from a private mental hospital to be checked for a brain tumor . It was Jesse 's private opinion that she was just crazy , but he would probably never find out what happened to her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jesse searched all over for a good vein . He began to sweat . Where the hell was a good vein , had n't this old man anything left ? His arms and legs were thin , ghastly . Jesse poked around for nearly ten minutes , using a tourniquet . A young doctor named Diebold , the chief resident on this service , came by to watch . Jesse got a vein located in the man 's left foot and began the fluids . Diebold made a wry clever comment about something  --  Jesse tried to respond with a laugh  --  but he was aware , vaguely and nervously , of another consciousness in the room , the old man who breathed wheezingly , eyes closed , mouth slightly open . But there was really no time to think about him . In the corridor Diebold said , " The old guy is dead , just between you and me . He 's finished . "  |p309Jesse  nodded and backed away . He called the apartment but no one answered . On the sixth ring he heard himself being paged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was wanted in the emergency room , which he was covering for another intern who had come down with mononucleosis . The elevator was too slow for Jesse so he ran down the backstairs ; outside the March air shimmered with sunlight and health that seemed very distant to him . He had no time for it . In the emergency room he had to clean up a young Negro , brought in by the police after a chase and an automobile accident ; he mopped blood and fixed the boy up , while in his brain the ringing of that telephone sounded . Why had n't she answered the telephone ? Was she standing there , watchingit , knowing it was Jesse ? They never argued . Her silence , her strange stubborn meekness , baffled him . The pregnancy had worn her down , her legs ached constantly , and yet she never complained  --  she hid her sickness as if it shamed her , just as being a woman seemed to shame her . But she never complained . And yet Jesse had come across a letter to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something Helene must have written to him : You are taking his desire to go into public health too seriously . Yes , I agree it is a delusion , but it will pass . Jesse exaggerates . . . . He had been stung at that letter . He had wanted to rip it up . Had Helene really said that he was deluded , had she actually used the word " delusion " ?  --  she had accused him once , but very gently , of wanting to accomplish too much , wanting to move too quickly . But what did this mean , what did Cady mean , by saying that he " exaggerated " ? The phrases kept coming back to him . I agree it is a delusion , but it will pass . Jesse exaggerates ... . It was Jesse 's intention to take a residency in General Medicine here and to join a public health clinic in a year or two ; this was really a modest goal . Cady would have wanted him to train for much more . Jesse did not understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for him . She would have his baby , the first of his babies . The police took the young man away . By this time it was too late for lunch and anyway Jesse had no appetite , so he went right to the sixth floor to work up another new admission with Myron Diebold ; a woman of sixty who had been brought in with heart failure . Her legs were grotesque , swollen to bursting . Diebold fired questions at her and Jesse , took down the answers . He wrote quickly , in a large spacious hand he had invented for himself : Dr. Vogel taking down information . Dr. Vogel inventing himself . Evidently this woman had had rheumatic fever as a child ; Jesse thought at once of Trick , who had passed into heart failure in Ann Arbor , but who had been brought out of it and had recovered , because the last Jesse had heard , Trick was living with his parents in Minnesota . Jesse was grateful that he had survived , and yet he was uneasy at the thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . Myron muttered to Jesse on the way out , " The old gal does n't look good to me . Hope she does n't die right away . " He walked with Jesse down the corridor , walking fast . Myron was talking about something , complaining , making vague absentminded swipes at his nose , and Jesse felt a surge of despair at the thought that nothing was ever finished , nothing was ever really clear to him . Since last July he had been running constantly . He had to cover too many patients , he worked with too many other interns and residents , overlapping their duties , he came to the end of nothing , he lost contact with patients who interested him , he had no time to look up records in this hospital and certainly not in other hospitals  --  in the beginning he had wanted zealously to trace the records of beaten-up children , knowing that their parents were bringing them from one hospital to another , but he had never had time , and anyway he was warned against this because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough and he did not eat enough , he had sudden rushes of panic , he had sudden impulses to laugh at the wrong time . Myron was chiding him for missing a luncheon meeting for the second time in a week . Jesse smiled dimly and said he had been busy . " Yes , you look worn out , " Myron said perfunctorily , sighing ; he looked worn out himself . Everyone looked worn out . But Jesse had really forgottenabout the luncheon meeting . The word " luncheon " struck him as a strange word . He said it aloud , as if testing it : " Luncheon . " He could not remember having used that word before in his life . " I forgot about luncheon , " he said , while Myron looked at him oddly . " Lunch . Luncheon . Lunch . Lunch . " He got away from Myron and went up to the interns ' lounge , where he had to force himself to decide between going to the lavatory or lying down at once . Milton Kuzma was sleeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smears of blood and vomit . Jesse did not want to wake him  --  Milton was having trouble atp311the hospital and their two-month-old baby at home disturbed his nights . Jesse could not decide : should he go to the lavatory or lie clown ? He was very tired . But if he lay down he might have to get up again in a few minutes . He stood by a cot , thinking . Minutes passed . He pressed his forefinger against his teeth , rubbing at the fine , rather slimy coating on them  --  the leftover scum of a minute 's panic , now forgotten . There was something else he was supposed to do . Telephone his wife . Yes , he should telephone his wife . But he could not decide about moving forward or backward or in any direction at all . His legs felt distant from him , not tired but impersonal , remote . That woman in heart failure : swollen legs . Fluid puffing up her flesh . Curious , Jesse bent to touch his own legs , to see what they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He could sit on the edge of the cot and rest like that , or he could lie down and sleep , or go to the lavatory right now and get it over with ; or he could telephone Helene . Milton Kuzma woke with a groan . " Jesse . . . ? What are you doing ? What time is it ? " Milton said vaguely . He passed his hands over his face . " Jesus , did I have a bad time . You heard about it , I suppose . That little girl . . . ? " Jesse was startled at Milton 's bleary eyes and dry , stained lips. " . . . they brought her in with meningitis . . . ? Jesus , was she going fast , and if you know what happened please do n't tell me ... . Then he was paged  --  Dr. Vogel , Dr. Vogel  --  in that efficient expressionless voice , and with relief he ran to the telephone . It was good to know what he must do ! Only someone who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pronounce him dead ? It was only one flight up . The patient , an old man , looked familiar to Jesse but Jesse could not remember him . He pronounced him dead . Yes , he was dead . A young blond nurse was saying shakily to Jesse , " This is the first time anybody died on me ... , " but Jesse was already on his way . He had new admissions to check all afternoon , and since he had decided not to take a nap and not to have lunch , he might as well get started on them at once . Now that he was moving , his legs moving energetically again , he would take advantage of momentum . It was a kind of gravity , sideways gravity . Horizontal gravity . He was pleased with himself . Sat on the edge of a windowsill and asked about complaints , symptoms , troubles , having to raise his voice so that the man in the bed could hear . Not very old , but he was nearly deaf ; diabetes ; trouble with gall bladder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask about everything , every small bit of bad news . The man stared at him stupidly . Past illnesses ? After a few awkward minutes Jesse got an answer , at least something to write down . Now , what about the illnesses of the man 's parents , grandparents , brothers and sisters ? A baffled stare . Could this old man have had parents ? Grandparents ? Jesse managed to get something out of him , something to write down . Yes , yes . Now a blood sample . A simple operation . But the old man flinched , then recoiled . Then began to shout in Jesse 's face . " No ! Get away ! You too young ! Not you ! " Jesse tried to soothe him . He took hold of the old man 's arm and the old man snatched it away . Then , swinging it back , he struck Jesse on the side of the face . " No blood from me , not me ! I 'll kill you ! Stick you with it instead ! " Jesse was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right . He approached the old man again , explaining something he had explained a hundred times before . His face stung lightly . This time the old man 's feet seemed to be coming to life , stirring beneath the bedclothes . He was cringing back against the stiff pillows , moaning , " No . No . No . " Jesse eyed his foot under the covers and wondered if he was strong enough to swing it out and kick Jesse with it . Probably not . White in the face , the man stared at him . Saliva glistening around his lips . Jesse talked gently to him . Gently . Someone leaned in the doorway and said , " You need any help in here ? " and Jesse , not glancing around , said that everything was under control . The old man shuddered and extended his arm to Jesse . Ah , that was good . Good . . . . Next , on the fourth floor , a dwarfish banged-up child of fifteen ; his mother pacing in the aisle between the beds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was homely , bruised in the face and shoulders , scratched , dazed . His lip was swollen and discolored . He had fallen down a flight of stairs . Fallen or was pushed ?  --  Jesse wondered as he took notes . The boy was very small for his age . Listless , his eyes open but unfocused . Was he feeble-minded ? Jesse was amazed at the number of feeblemindedpeople he saw here . The mother stood close to Jesse and complained , " He fell . He 's always falling . He ca n't walk right . Or maybe he ca n't see right . He even falls upstairs . The kids push himp313around , the bastards are always chasing him . He 's been falling since he was a baby . Falls on his head . His nose bleeds for no reason  --  when he picks it , it bleeds twice as bad . " Her breath was intimate and liquorish . Jesse tried not to look at her tight pullover sweater and her red slacks , very tight in the hips . Open-toed shoes . Somethingtinkled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not want to glance up . She kept touching Jesse , but very lightly , as if they were simply making conversation . " What do you think , Doctor ? You are a doctor , are n't you ? You look kind of young to me . But I bet you know what you 're doing , huh ? What do you think of him ? They said probable concussion . What 's that ? When can I bring him home ? " Jesse examined the boy and saw the old scars , the old sprawling yellowish bruises of a few weeks before , old bumps , the bad teeth , the curious drab eyes . No resistance . Jesse moved his hand in front of the boy 's face and his eyes did not seem to notice anything . Blind ? The mother was complaining in a voice that rose and fell as she thought of the other patients in nearby beds and then forgot them in her anger , then recalled them again with a kind of demure shame . " I ca n't take much more of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He 's always getting knocked around . Wo n't listen . They kicked him out of school , he was so dumb . His goddamn father sucks ale and that 's that . It 's not my responsibility all by myself . Listen , you have to cuff him to make him even look at you . I 'm not kidding . I had to take off work today just for this . . . . " After a few minutes Jesse located one of the young doctors on the staff and consulted with him . Then , the woman 's voice still shrill and flirtatiousin his head , he took the backstairs all the way down to the cafeteria . Must eat . It was important to eat . He remembered the day Helene had been sitting here , just sittinghere by herself . What a shock that had been , to approach her and to realize that she was noticing nothing ! She had awakened only when he had touched her . . . . The odors of food discouraged Jesse but he pressed forward through a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wet . Jack Galt , another intern , turned to talk to him . He lived near Jesse and sometimes he dropped in to visit Jesse and Helene ; a tall , thin , slightly stooped young man with glasses , very intelligent , very nervous . He was talking to Jesse excitedly . Something about an out-of-town physician who had had a coronary during a routine appendectomy that morning . Jack was on surgical service . Jesse could not pay much attention because he had to decide about what to eat  --  a tuna fish sandwich , which was on white bread and wrapped in cellophane , or should he take a chicken salad sandwich , which was on cracked wheat bread ? He stared at the sandwiches while Jack talked . Jack poked his arm . " There 's a line behind you , " he said . Jesse hurried along and took only a cup of coffee . He was not really hungry after all . Jack sat across from him , sighing with exhaustion and a kind of counterfeit despair . What a mess upstairs ! The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Once when Jack had come to visit the Vogels he had complained to them in the same voice about a friend of his who had returned a Mahler symphony , a record , badly scratched ; and now Jesse got this old news confused with the news about the coronary in the operating room . He felt lightheaded . Something nagged at him : should he go back and check on the uremia case ? He had not worked up the man properly . And when the man had tried to talk about his bad dreams Jesse had not responded . . . . And the bangedupboy with the mother . Should check him out , see if he had a record of hospitalizations . Someone was beating him , obviously . Now Jack Galt was gossiping about Milton Kuzma , who had been given hell by Dr. Perrault just the day before . Had Jesse heard ? Everyone agreed that it had not been Milton 's fault , whatever happened . And something else had happened , not a patient of Perrault'sbut an out-of-town man 's : an ulcer patient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hall . Jack said sharply , " You 're spilling your coffee , Jesse . " For some reason this reminded Jesse of his need to telephone home . He left his coffee and Jack Galt and went to look for a telephone . All in use . He could go back up to the lounge . Or wait . He decided to wait . Then he heard his name being paged , and was called back up to the fourth floor to look in on a patient with Myron Diebold and Dr. Costello , who was explaining the patient 's trouble when Jesse entered the room . Dr. Costello had a pleasant high-pitched voice . Undiagnosed pain in the abdomen ; not gall bladder ; hernia , a stone somewhere ? Costello was a very businesslike man in his forties , with neat , stern eyebrows , and a manner of lecturing to his inferiors in all conversation . Jesse was always humble around him . Now he asked Jesse a question , and though Jesse could have madep315a reasonable guess , he thought it more prudent to say that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was interrupted triumphantlyby Costello . " Hah ! Where 'd you dig that up ? " Diebold flushed . After this , Jesse went up to the lounge and the lavatory , at last , and now another intern was sleeping in the chair Milton Kuzma had been in , his breath raspy and labored . Jesse washed his hands for quite a while , dreamily . Then he was called down to the emergency room again ; a child no more than three or four years old , his face and head swollen , especially his eyelids and lips . He was unconscious . Jesse estimated a hundred bites  --  insect bites of some kind . Big red swellings , tiny angry blood-flecked dots , purplish areas of flesh . . . bright-colored , elaborate bumps that overlapped one another . The mother , who looked about sixteen years old , hovered nearby , weeping . " Jesus , is n't that a sight , " one of the staff doctors said , whistling thinly . The child 's eyelids were swollen shut , his lips enormous , as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very thin from being stretched so hard . Jesse felt sick . A taste in his mouth suddenly of poison : the poison in that child 's bloodstream . When he was finished there , he telephoned Helene again . This time she did answer the phone . " Yes , hello , is this Jesse . . . ? " she asked faintly . He felt a rush of love for her that had something to do with the child he had just seen ; it unnerved him , his love for her and for the baby she was carrying , his dependency upon her . He asked her how she felt . She answered briefly : a little nauseated yet , but nothing worse . Then they fell into silence . Characteristic silence . Jesse was suddenly eager to make her talk , he was desperate , guilty . . . he must get her through this pregnancy , he must prevent her escaping him . . . . He began to rub his eye in that silence , wondering what she was thinking . He feared her escaping to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life she had led there . What had her father 's letter meant , what had he meant by Jesse 's " exaggeration " ? But he did not dare ask . Instead , he asked , as if he had just thought of it , " Helene , what time is it ? " " Ten o'clock . " " Ten o'clock at night ? " he said , surprised . He stopped rubbing his eve and looked around the lounge . Yes , it must be the end of a clay , for newspapers lay around on the floor ; cigarette butts in the ashtrays , some of which were on the floor too . A spent , stale smell . But where had the day gone ... ? He felt that he might be losing his mind . " Are you sure it 's ten o'clock at night ? " he asked  | The windows of the lounge showed that it was dark out . He had not noticed that before . Helene spoke softly to him , as if aware of his amazement . Yes , yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He tried to imagine her , his wife  --  her fine skin fading with pregnancy , her hair listless and broken off at the ends , no longer so smoothly brushed back from her face . Enlarged veins in her legs . Slender legs , breaking veins . A body swollen out of proportion and difficult to balance . I-Ier spine ached . Her spine was too delicate for her belly . It made no allowance for the baby , unwilling to give in , to be resilient . A stubborn spine . A spine , so stubborn might snap . . . . Beneath her ordinary wifely words there was a silence , still , that reproached him for not knowing her . But did Jesse really know anyone ; how close could he come to knowing anyone ? What must he do to know her ? Once she had come to the hospital to pick him up , at eight in the morning . He had seen her walking through the parking lot , quickly and deftly making her way around the parked cars , and out of nowhere a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her off , and then he paused , stopped , lit a cigarette with his hands cupped about a match , turning slowly on his heels to watch her hurry by . Jesse had been angry at the arrogance of the man , but Helene had simply glanced at him coldly and contemptuously , without flinching , raising her face toward the man at just the right moment , saying nothing , dismissing him with her own arrogance . Whether the man had said anything to her or not Jesse did n't know and he would not have wanted to ask . In that instant he himself had felt somehow weakened and banished , as if he were a brother to that man who had been so coldly snubbed and not that woman 's husband .... Her private smile , slow and girlish . Her ashen skin . The length of her ashen body , oddly slender except for that swollen belly . He thought of her constantly and it seemed to him that the secret of the world was somehow in her , in her body , casually possessed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to learn it , to learn her ? His eye itched painfully and he rubbed it hard . He had known Anne-Marie better . He had been closer to Anne-Marie . " How often were you sick today ? " he asked hesitantly , knowing that she hated to talk about this . She did not answer at once . Then she said , " I just did n't feel like answering the telephone when it rang . I didn'tp317feel like it . " " Yes , I know , but how were you ? Are you better now ? " Jesse asked . " Yes . I 'm better now . I 'm better , " she said bitterly . A few more seconds of silence . . . Jesse began to perspire , wondering what to do . Then Helene went on in the same voice , " I ate some dinner so that I 'd have something to vomit up later this evening . I 'm grateful for your concern . In the morning I 'll vomit again  --  a pint or a quart  --  it 's all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shocked , stared out the window at the darkness , the parking-lot lights . After a minute or so Helene said in a different voice , " When are you coming home , in the morning ? " " Yes , " said Jesse . " Do you want me to pick you up ? " she asked . Jesse did not seem to hear this question . He stood rubbing his eye slowly , ponderously . Helene said , " Jesse , if I have this baby you wo n't make me have another . Will you ? Not another baby , Jesse . You wo n't make me have another baby , will you . . . ? " There was something in his eye , maybe an eyelash . The other day he had worked for a hard ten minutes getting an eyelash out of the reddenedeye of a woman . Tears . A tiny stinging lash . " I 'd better come home , " Jesse said . Helene laughed and said lightly , " No . No . There 's no reason . I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm not sure I even said those things . " They said good-by and Jesse remained with the telephone receiver in his hand . A dead end . Not even a dial tone . Nothing . Women showed up at the hospital , bleeding . All the time . Tryingto dislodge the flesh inside their wombs , feverish with the need to scrape themselves out . What a mess they made for someone else to mop up . . . ! Fetuses big as a man 's fist . Basins of blood . The doctors said they were crazy . Why so wild ? So vicious ? Savage as animals turning upon themselves , but also very sly and imaginative . The doctors said they were crazy but Jesse did not think it was that simple . A few weeks ago a night nurse had called Jesse down . There was a woman bleeding badly , looking surprised and distraught . In fact , she had just walked in off the street ; she had asked where the ladies ' room was . Wanted to fix herself up , she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the floor , turning into a small stream . The woman , in her early twenties , was a large-boned healthy girl with a heavy chest and stomach . Would n't sit down . Kept staggering around , clutching at the hacks of chairs , a table . Oddly dressed for this time of year  --  she wore only a sleeveless top of some silky , cheap beige material , tucked loosely into a tweed skirt that was too short for the fashions of the last several years . She was shivering convulsively . Her chest heaved . Still , with all that bleeding , she would not sit down . Jesse and Jack Galt , who were covering the emergency room together , had to calm her down . Blood ran down into her shoes . Onto the floor . Jack tried to urge her one way , but she would turn and brush against Jesse blindly , and then back toward Jack again , while one of the nurses tried to coax her into lying down . Finally they got her onto the table . She seized Jesse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what it is , Doctor ! It just happened . I do n't know what it is  --  " There was blood everywhere and when Jesse tried to do a vaginal exam the woman began to fight him . It took several people to hold her down . " No , let me go ! They do n't know where I went  --  they 're waiting for me back home  --  " The bleeding seemed to be getting worse . Jesse , now panicked , was covered with blood . She was going to bleed to death right in front of him . Bleed to death . He tried to examine her again . This time he came out with a handful of dark clotted blood and flesh and what looked like slivers of glass . . . . Could it be glass ? The slivers were fairly large , curved pieces of ordinary glass , probably from a small fruit-juice glass ; Jesse had stared at the red-and-yellow diamond design on the outside ... . The woman 's screams . Screams . A fruit-juice glass jammed up toward a womb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ startled , put the telephonereceiver back . Myron held a sandwich out to Jesse . " Dr. Vogel , my friend , Jack Galt was telling us you did n't look well . Here . Maybe you 're hungry . " Jesse unwrapped the sandwich eagerly . It was a cheese and lettuce sandwich on white bread , not from the cafeteria but from the vending machine ; but his mouth watered violently . He ate it in four or five bites . " Now , why do n't you sleep ? " Myron said . " I 'm going to hang around for another hour and I can cover for you . " " All right , " Jesse said . " Did you hear about Milt Kuzma . . . ? " " Yes , " Jesse said , not wanting to hear anything more . " Perrault really gave him hell . Steer clear of Perrault . " " Yes . " " Anything interesting come in today ? "  | " No . " Myron left and Jesse sat down on the edge of one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nagging him : that dwarfish boy . Those dull unfocused eyes . He certainly had not seen the boy hcfore . But the boy looked familiar . He must check the boy again , joust get back to the room when the mother was n't around and question him . Must make a special note on the record  --  " injuries suspicious "  --  Restless , Jesse got up and , having nothing to do , went down to the fourth floor . At night , with things quieted down , the hospital did not seem so confusing ; each floor had its own unmistakableappearance , its own shadowy lights cast by certain arrangementsin the nurses ' stations and from vending machines that sold coffee and cigarettes . Each floor seemed to have its own smell , its own taste . Jesse could not remember which room the boy was in . IIc was certain it was on this floor . He questioned one of thenurses , who smiled at him curiously . When he asked her about the boy with the head injuries , she did n't seem to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had coffee together and Jesse thought uneasily of Anne-Marie . Yes , he had been close to her , he had loved her . He remembered the violence of his passion for her . Then his mind skipped onto Trick , then onto Trick 's collapse on the sidewalk . Caving in . His legs caving in . Jesse began to breathe quickly , as if he had escaped some awful danger . After a few minutes he began to feel better . He would check on t he boy again in a few days . He would check other hospitals , see if he could find the boy 's records somewhere else . It seemed possible lo him that he could do this . Now that things had quieted down ... . There was the possibility of completion , of seeing someone through , and not these jagged snatches of people , their personalities reduced t o a gall bladder , a lacerated scalp , a patch of burned skin . He loved t hem , how he wanted to help them ... ! He did love them:He could crawl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hook himself up to them : his blood and fluids flowing into them . His strong heartbeat would encourage theirs . . . . This little nurse told him her name was Rosemary . She was very interested in whatever he had to say . Exhausted , Jesse began to talk . He talked about the child with the insect bites , the old man who had hit him , the dwarfish wreck of a boy and how his parents should be treated , not just him , because of course they were sick , they were all crazy , thep320entire family would have to be brought in . " Not just the victim . The entire family , " Jesse said . Rosemary thought that was a wonderfulidea . People should n't be allowed to die , Jesse said in a rush . Should n't be abandoned . Doctors should never give up , never , no matter how tired they are ... . Rosemary thought that was a wonderful idea . Jesse 's throat felt raw . He was talking too much . Reluctantly he said good-by , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him as if hating to give him up . He went up to the interns ' on-call room , where he lay down stiffly and considered sleeping . But if he fell asleep the telephone would probably ring . He waited for it to ring , jerking from time to time as if he were asleep , conscious of his muscles oddly jerking . He was not asleep , but he dreamed of that fistful of black clotty blood and bright red blood he had hauled out . A broken fruitjuiceglass . What a surprise that young woman had given him ! Women were always surprises , though ; anything could come out of their bodies . . . . He sat up , frightened . He thought the telephonehad rung but evidently it had n't . So he lay back again and fell asleep . At once he returned to his dream of that woman 's body , all the blood , the mess , the mutilated fetus . A woman 's body and its dark surprises . Like a corridor : like the corridor outside the door of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was drafty , especiallynear the backstairs . Heat and draft . Heat rising , cold air cuttingthrough it , hot and cold , up and down . Corridors were adventures . Doors opened off to the right or to the left , doors that tempted you to enter . First you open the screen door , then the inside door . Turn the knob . Push in . The telephone rang , jarring him awake . He jumped up in terror . Only one o'clock . He was called over to look at a postoperative gall-bladder case . The woman whimpered that she was afraid of dying . Jesse did not bother to get angry with the nurse , he simply brushed past her and went to check over the woman . She was crying and clutching at Jesse 's arm . This was a semiprivate room , and the other patient , a sleeping woman , snored through the frantic consultation . A woman 's face changes so rapidly , Jesse thought , it seems to change colors . . . . " But why cry now ? You 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with fear , twitching , shivering , all its Innnan womanly strength focused upon him , needing him . He could not leave . He stayed with her while she whimpered about dying , about the pain she felt , the snippy nurses , the taste in her mouth .... Jesse soothed her with words . Words . He was not sure if this was real or part of his dream . She mumbled something about his age : he was her son 's age . Jesse blushed as if she had flattered him grossly . After about twenty minutes of this , with the night nurse hanging around silent and curious , Jesse was called over to the psychiatric ward , where a patient had started vomiting violently . The nurse on the telephone told Jesse that the man was tieing to throw up his insides . Jesse hurried over there , wondering If the nurse was teasing him , if maybe there was n't some conspiracyat night to keep him going , to keep him from sleeping , to flirt with him , to draw him out to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down at the sight of the patient . Yes , this did look serious . A huge fat man , not much older than Jesse ; billows of flesh , flab , blubber , a bare wobbling chest smeared with vomit and blood  --  darting crazy eyes . Oh , those eyes ! Jesse was becoming accustomed to them . I ie hated fat people . Hated crazy people . Well , perhaps he did not really hate them , no , because hatred was out of place in his work ; he was disturbed by them . They were sick in a way that did not interest him . With crazy people you could not stick a tube down them and drain out the poison or the excess fluid ; you could n't hook up some plasma and fluids and get them healthy again . Their sickness was a stubborn sickness , stubborn as a fist that could not be unclenched .... This patient was convulsing. throwing himself around like a small elephant , a small whale . Jesse wondered if he had managed to poison himself somehow , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restraints and said in a hypnotic , weary voice , " You 're not going to die . Not going to die . Do n't be afraid . " The man 's heart was going like mad , as if wanting to burst ; but Jesse was not going to let it burst . Not tonight . Not while Jesse was on duty . The needle he tried to use on the man snapped in two so he gave him a rectal sedative instead , and by now the place reeked . Ugh , how he hated fat ! And such layers of fait ! No part of the body was ugly in itself , no face was truly ugly , hilt such quantities of flesh were hardly physical at all  --  they were a kind of spiritual obscenity.  |p322Eyes  rolling back in his head . The man lost consciousness in the beginning of a convulsion . " All , there , " Jesse said softly . He sponged off the man 's wet face . Then he sponged off his own face , breathing hard . He asked the nurses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cautiously , for he sometimes dreaded what he might be told . " In real life , " a nurse said , frowning , " he was a high school teacher . " In real life ! Jesse stared at the fat man . Harsh labored breathing , minute twitches of his flesh , spasmodic twitches of his fingers . . . . Jesse felt his own skin tingle , as if about to twitch in sympathy with the man . Jesse hated death . He hated the way people tried for death , as if stretching to reach it , grunting with the effort . Why did so many of them want to die ? It was terrible to see a human being convinced he must die . The nurses , splattered with vomit , told Jesse about all the trouble this young man had been to them . As they spoke , sullen and faintly excited , Jesse stared at the unconscious man , this fat , sick creature who seemed to him to exist at the limits of human life , human reality , hardly in the family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man 's massive fleshly certainty , his absolute being , as if so much flesh were a mockery of Jesse 's own spare flesh . The man 's face twitched and seemed to be undergoing changes . Rapid flashes of dreams  --  nightmares  --  stretching his face out of shape , then relaxing it again . What was he dreaming ? Jesse felt a sudden desire , an almost painful desire , to know what that man was dreaming . He would spend a lifetime in the service of sick people , he was prepared to give up much of his own life to them , and yet he would never know what went on in their heads ... . He ran upstairs to take a shower , to get that filth off him . He could n't stand it . The fat man 's big straining face remained in his mind . It was almost a human face , yet not quite human . Jesse believed he had a secret face himself , a monstrous face that gave its special cast to his own normal features and that he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really seen this secret face of his . That monstrous fat man had shown his true face angrily , viciously , withoutshame . And his heart  --  Jesse had felt that heart , enormous and pounding . Such intimacy , Jesse feeling the heart of a stranger ! How close they had been , like brothers , like twins ! . . . Jesse puzzled over the outrageous stink of the vomit . Had it been poison of some kind ?  |p323Soa|ped  and rinsed clean , rubbed dry with a towel . He sighed . He lav down and the back of his mind muddied at once . It was peacefuland good in this ugly little room , his private room for the night ... yes , it was good to be on duty , to be responsible for so many people . It gave him happiness to be here and to know that he was needed . In another week he would go on the surgical service , which he feared a little because he feared Dr. Perrault , who was Chief of Surgery ... and really he had no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medical practice . General medical practice : his life was leading him in that direction . . .. Awakened suddenly by a telephone call : three o'clock . A nurse somewhere in the hospital wanted permission to give someonea sleeping pill half an hour before it was scheduled . Jesse lay down again and must have slept , because the telephone rang again , ringing loudly , and he jumped up with his heart pounding and could not think for an instant where he was . Helene ? Had somethinghappened to Helene ? It was from the emergency room ; a nurse who sounded hysterical . Jesse pulled on his trousers , stumbling . Five-fifteen . When Jesse got down there he saw why the nurse was hysterical  --  a man bleeding in a thick stream from what hooked like the very pit of his belly , his groin , held down onto a table by two ambulance attendants and a nurse . Cries . Confusion . " My God , " Jesse said when he saw what the wound was . For a moment he could not move , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sight made something click off in his brain  --  it was too much to assess , he must go through the steps one at a time . First , get the man down . Down flat . A young woman who must have ridden along in the ambulance was in Jesse 's way and he pushed her impatiently aside and got to work . So much blood ! Why was there so much blood ? The man was in his late thirties ; he had a face that must have been handsome but had now gone white and hard , smeared with his own blood . Blood in his hair . His lips were white and he was struggling to breathe , struggling with the nurse and Jesse . His pulse raced out of control ; he had gone into shock . Jesse got the shock blocks into place and the table was tipped back , and still the man struggled , and Jesse had to fight down a gagging sensation . All this blood unnerved him , he was even slipping in it , mid yet he knew that blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equipped with  --  all he had to do was get a sample and prepare for a transfusion , yes , he had done this many times before , except now his own hands were so bloody and the nurses so frightened and the strange young woman  --  she was hardly more than a girl , maybe twenty years old  --  so terrified that his mind seemed in danger of breaking into splinters . What if he found parts of a broken glass jammed up into the man 's groin ? But the man had done it with a knife , according to the ambulance attendant , all by himself with a knife . A knife ! Jesse listened and kept working , workingso fast that he did n't have time to break . The testicles slashed , hated so viciously and slashed so viciously . . . . But everything was under control . Jesse would not make a mistake . No you do n't , he thought as the man tried to lunge backward , as if fleeing his own wound . No you do n't , no dying tonight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alcohol . An odor of panic . The young woman , backing away , had bumped into another table . Her hands were out before her in a gesture of supplication . Blood-smeared hands . Fingernails that had been painted carefully , a very pale pink , and now the hands smeared with blood . Jesse glanced up at her face . She was staring at the bleeding man , staring fixedly at him , her face childish with alarm . The skin seemed to be of slightly differing colors , or shades of color , like petals overlaid upon petals . A very fine , healthy skin . The girl 's eyes were dilated , dazed , as if she were staring toward Jesse through water , unable to get her vision into focus , into belief . Slender , blond . Strokes of blood on her face like faint water-color brush strokes . She wore something beige-also smeared with blood , soaked with blood in front  --  All we need is for her to faint . Jesse thought . " Got a call that somebody tried to kill himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " but Jesus , what a surprise ! I almost puked ! Had to carry him right out through the lobby of the Palmer House , bleeding like a pig ! " Jesse blinked . It crossed his mind that he had not paid for the cheese sandwichhe had eaten that night . In a few minutes the bleeding was under control , the man hooked up ; his trousers in a bloody clump underfoot , as if they had been part of him , amputated and discarded . Jesse felt as if he were being blown along on a rich gust of wind , an element that was boisterous and good . Around him were shaky , exhausted people . They lookedp325sick . Almost as pale as the man on the table . But Jesse was lightheadedand he could not help gloating : Nobody is going to die tonight if I can help it . Mopping himself off , he looked around the messy room , its glinting metallic surfaces , its splatterings of blood that were like exclamation marks , and everything seemed to him manageable now , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nobody is going to die ... . " Where did she go ? " Jesse cried . The young woman was gone . They ran out into the corridor . She was gone . One of the nurses went down to a women 's lavatory but it was empty . " Where did she go ? What happened ? " Jesse asked . He had to make out the report with the help of the ambulance attendant and the man 's wallet , fished out of his bloody trousers . Jesse was writing up the report when Milton Kuzma came in . " Jesse , " he said . It was more than a greeting . Jesse glanced up , a little confused . Milton was wearing street clothes and for an instant Jesse did not recognize him . " Jesse . . . . Everyone 's talking about what happened here ; it 's really a mess , it looks like a mess . . . But look , Jesse , there 's nothing to worry about , " he said , laying his hand on Jesse 's arm while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report form , " the fact is I came over to get you because of I Iclene , but there 's nothing to worry about , everything is normal and regular . . . . Jesse ? Helene started having pains a few hours ago : Hid she called us , and Susan drove her to Women 's Hospital . She could n't get hold of you . It 's all right , Jesse , everything is under control , do n't worry .... Blazack knows about it and he 's on his way , at this time of the morning ... I think that 's pretty damn good of him . . . . Jesse , are you listening ? The contractions are close together now  --  so , Jesse  --  look , Jesse , I 'll cover for you now and you can go to the hospital . Women 's Hospital , right ? You know what to do ? I told the taxi to wait out back and he 's going to wait for you . " " What did you say ? " Jesse said , looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with me and take a shower And change your clothes . You 've got enough time , " Milton said sternly . " Come on . There 's nothing to worry about but you 'd letter get over there as soon as you can . She 's a few weeks early .... " Jesse could not understand what this man was talking about . It was strange to see him in this part of the hospital in ordinary **29;13026;TOOLONG ! " Dr. Jastrow gasped out the name and stared . He sat as usual on the terrace , the blue blanket over his legs , the gray shawl around his shoulders , the writing board and yellow pad on his lap . A cold breeze blowing across the valley from Siena fluttered Jastrow 's pages . In the translucent air the red-walled town , with its black-and-white striped cathedral atop the vineyard-checkeredhills , looked hauntingly like the medieval Siena in old frescoes . " Hello , A.J. " " Dear me , Byron ! I declare I 'll be a week recovering from the start you 've given me ! We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both absolutely certain you 'd be in the States by now . " " She 's here ? " " Of course . She 's up in the library . " " Sir , will you excuse me ? " " Yes , go ahead , let me collect myself  --  oh , and Byron , tell Maria I 'd like some strong tea right away . " Byron took the center hall steps three at a time and walked into the library . She stood at the desk in a gray sweater , a black skirt , pale and wide-eyed . " It is , by God ! It is you . Nobody else galumphs up those stairs like that . " " It 's me . " " Why the devil did you come back ? " " I have to make a living . " " You 're an imbecile . Why did n't you let us know you were coming ? " ' Well , I thought I 'd better just come . " She approached him , stretched out a hand uncertainly , and put it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold . " Anyway , you look rested . You seem to have put on some weight . " She backed off awkwardly and abruptly . " I owe you an apology . I was feeling beastly that day in Konigsberg , and if I was rude to you I 'm sorry . " She walked away from him and sank into her desk chair . " Well , we can use you here , but surprises likep257this are never pleasant . Do n't you know that yet ? " As though he had returnedfrom an errand in town , she resumed clattering at the typewriter . That was all his welcome . Jastrow put him back to work , and within a few days the old routines were restored . It was as though the Polish experience had never occurred , as though neither of them had left the hilltop . The traces of the war in these quiet hills were few . Only sporadic shortages of gasoline created any difficulty . The Milan and Florence newspapersthat reached them played down the war . Even on the BBC broadcaststhere was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as remote as a Chinese earthquake . Because the buses had become unreliable , Dr. Jastrow gave Byron a lodging on the third floor of the villa : a cramped little maid 's room with cracking plaster walls , and a stained ceiling that leaked in hard rains . Natalie lived directly below Byron in a second-floor bedroom looking out on Siena . Her peculiar manner to him persisted . At mealtimes , and generallyin Jastrow 's presence , she was distantly cordial . In the library she was almost uncivil , working away in long silences , and giving terse cool answers to questions . Byron had a modest opinion of himself and his attractions , and he took his treatment as probably his due , though he missed the comradeship of their days in Poland and wondered why she never talked about them . He thought he had probably annoyed her by following her here . He was with her again , and that was why he had come ; so , for all the brusque treatment , he was as content as a dog reunited with an irritable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book was on the shelf for the moment , in favor of an expanded magazine article , " The Last Palio . " In describing the race , Jastrow had evoked a gloom-filled image of Europe plunging again toward war . A piece startling in its foresight , it had arrived on the editor 's desk on the first of September , the day of the invasion . The magazine printed it , and Jastrow 's publisher cabled him a frantic request to work it up into a short book , preferably containing a note of optimism ( however slight ) on the outcome of the war . The cable mentioned a large advance against royalties . This was the task in hand . In this brief book , Jastrow was striking an Olympian , farseeing , forgivingnote . The Germans would probably be beaten to the ground again , he wrote ; and even if they gained the rule of the earth , they would in the end be tamed and subdued by their subject peoples , as their ancestors , the Goths and Vandals , had been tamed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour . It was a recurring human fever fated to cool and pass . Reason and freedom were what all human history eternallymoved toward.  |p258The  Germans were the bad children of Europe , Jastrow argued : egotistic , willful , romantic , always poised to break up faltering patterns of order . Arminius had set the ax to the Pax Romana ; Martin Luther had broken the back of the universal Church ; now Hitler was challengingEurope 's unsteady regime of liberal capitalism , based on an obsolete patchwork structure of nations . The " Palio " of Europe , wrote Jastrow , the contest of hot little nationalismsin a tiny crowded cockpit of a continent , a larger Siena with the sea for three walls and Asia for a fourth , was worn out . As Siena had only one water company and one power company , one telephone system and one mayor , instead of seventeen of these in the seventeen make-believe sovereignties called Goose , Caterpillar , Giraffe , and so forth , so Europe was ripe for the same commonsense unification . Hitler , a bad-boy genius @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breakup of the old order cruelly , wrongly , with Teutonic fury , but what mattered was that he was essentially correct . The Second World War was the last Palio . Europe would emerge less colorful but more of a rational and solid structure , whichever side won the idiotic and gory horse race . Perhaps this painful but healthy process would become global , and the whole earth would be unified at last . As for Hitler , the villain of the melodrama , he would either be hunted down and bloodily destroyed like Macbeth , or he would have his triumph and then he would fall or die . The stars would remain , so would the earth , so would the human quest for freedom , understanding , and love among brothers . As he typed repeated drafts of these ideas , Byron wondered whether Jastrow would have written such a tolerant and hopeful book had he spent September under bombardment in Warsaw , instead of in his villa over looking Siena . He thought " The Last Palio " was a lot of high-flown it relevant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were coming to Natalie from Leslie Slote , one or two a week . She seemed less excited over them than she had been in the spring , when she would rush off to her bedroom to read them , and return looking some times radiant , sometimes tearful . Now she casually skimmed the single space typed pages at her desk , then shoved them in a drawer . One rainy day she was reading such a letter when Byron , typing away at the Pali() book , heard her say , " Good God ! " He looked up . " Something the matter ? " " No , no , " she said , very red in the face , waving an agitated hand and flipping over a page . " Sorry . It 's nothing at all . "  |p259Byron  resumed work , struggling with one of Jastrow 's bad sentences . The professor wrote in a spiky hurried hand , often leaving out letters or words . He seldom closed his s 's and o 's . It was anybody 's guess what words some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them out , but Byron disliked her pained condescending way of doing it . " Well ! " Natalie sat back in her chair with a thump , staring at the letter . " Briny  --  " " Yes ? " She hesitated , chewing her full lower lip . " Oh , hell , I ca n't help it . I 've got to tell someone , and you 're handy . Guess what I hold here in my hot little hand ? " She rustled the pages . " I see what you 're holding . " " You only think you do . " She laughed in a wicked way . " I 'm going to tell you . It 's a proposal of marriage from a gentleman named Leslie Manson Slote , Rhodes Scholar , rising diplomat , and elusive bachelor . And what do you think of that , Byron Henry ? " " Congratulations , " Byron said . The buzzer on Natalie 's desk rang . " Oh , lord . Briny , please go and see what A.J. wants . I 'm in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desk and thrust long white hands in her hair . Dr. Jastrow sat blanketed in the downstairs study on the chaise longue by the fire , his usual place in rainy weather . Facing him in an armchair , a fat pale Italian official , in a green and yellow uniform and black halfboots , was drinking coffee . Byron had never seen the man or the uniform before . " Oh , Byron , ask Natalie for my resident status file , will you ? She knows where it is . " Jastrow turned to the official . " Will you want to see their papers too ? " " Not today , prof essore . Only yours . " Natalie looked up with an embarrassed grin from rereading the letter . " Oh , hi . What 's doing ? " Byron told her . Her face sobering , she took a key from her purse and unlocked a small steel file by the desk . " Here . " She gave him a manilafolder tied with red tape . " Does it look like trouble ? Shall I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked . " As he descended the stairs he heard laughter from the study , and rapid jovial talk . " Oh , thank you , Byron , " Jastrow said , breaking into English as he entered , " just leave it here on the table . " He resumed his anecdote in Italian about the donkey that had gotten into the grounds the previous week , laid waste to a vegetable patch , and chewed up a wholep260chapter of manuscript . The official 's belted belly shook with laughter . In the library Natalie was typing again . The Slote letter was out of sight . " There does n't seem to be much of a problem , " Byron said . " That 's good , " she said placidly . At dinner that night Dr. Jastrow hardly spoke , ate less than usual , and drank two extra glasses of wine . In this household , where things were so monotonously the same day after day , night after night , the first extra glass was an event , the second a bombshell . Natalie finally said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Jastrow came out of an abstracted stare with a little headshake . " Strangely enough , Giuseppe again . " Giuseppe was the assistant gardener , whom he had recently discharged : a scrawny , lazy , stupid old drunkard with wiry black hairs on his big knobby purple nose . Giuseppe had left open the gate through which the donkey had entered . He was always committing such misde meanors . Jastrow had lost his temper over the destroyed chapter and the ravaged vegetable beds , had been unable to write for two days , and had suffered bad indigestion . " How does that officer know Giuseppe ? " Byron said . " That 's the odd part . He 's from the alien registration bureau in Florence , yet he mentioned Giuseppe 's nine children , the difficulty of finding work nowadays , and so forth . When I said I 'd rehire him , that ended it . He just handed me the registration papers with a victorious grin . " Jastrow sighed and laid his napkin on the table . " I 've put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't mind . I 'm rather tired . Tell Maria I 'll have my fruit and cheese in the study . " Natalie said when the professor was gone , " Let 's bring the coffee to my room . " " Sure . Great . " Never before had she invited him there . Sometimes in his room above he could hear her moving about , a tantalizing , faint , lovely noise . He followed her upstairs with a jumping pulse . " I live in a big candy box , " she said with a self-conscious look , openinga heavy door . " Aaron bought the place furnished , you know , and left it just the way the lady of the house had it . Ridiculous for me , but  --  " She snapped on a light . It was an enormous room , painted pink , with pink and gilt furniture , pink painted cupids on a blue and gold ceiling , pink silk draperies , and a huge double bed covered in frilly pink satin . Dark Natalie , in the old brown wool dress she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Watteau setting . But Byron found the conp261trast as exciting as everything else about her . She lit the log fire in the marble fireplace carved with Roman figures , and they sat in facing armchairs , taking coffee from the low table between them . " Why do you suppose Aaron 's so upset ? " Natalie said , settling comfortably in the large chair and pulling the long pleated skirt far down over her beautiful legs . " Giuseppe 's an old story . Actually it was a mistaketo fire him . He knows all about the water connections and the electriclines , much more than Tomaso . And he 's really good at the topiary work , even if he is a dirty old drunk . " " A.J. was coerced , Natalie . " She bit her lip , nodding . Byron added , " We 're at the mercy of these people , A.J. even more than you and me . He owns property , he 's stuck here . " " Oh , the Italians are all right . They 're not Germans . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advice . Get out ! " Natalie smiled . " Lekh lekha . My God , how far off that all seems . I wonder how he is . " Her smile faded . " I 've shut Warsaw from my mind . Or tried to . " " I do n't blame you . " " How about you , Briny ? Do you ever think about it ? " " Some . I keep dreaming about it . " " Oh , God , so do I. That hospital  --  I go round and round in it , night after night  --  " " When Warsaw fell , " Byron said , " it hit me hard . " He told Natalie about the Wannsee episode . At his description of the waiter 's sudden turnabout , she laughed bitterly . " Your father sounds superb . " " He 's all right . " " He must think I 'm a vampire who all but lured you to your death . " " We have n't talked about you . " Sudden gloom shadowed Natalie 's face . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stir the fire , Briny . I 'm cold . Giuseppe 's brought in green wood , as usual . " He made the fire flare , and threw on it a light log from a blighted tree , which quickly blazed . " Ah , that 's good ! " She jumped up , turned off the electric chandelier , and stood by the fire , looking at the flames . " That moment in the railroad station , " she nervously burst out , " when they took away the Jews ! I still ca n't face it . That was one reason I was so nasty at Konigsberg . I was in torture . I kept thinking that I could have done something . Suppose I 'd stepped forward , said I was Jewish , forced the issue ? Suppose we 'd all created a scandal ? It might have made a difference . But we calmly went to the train , and they trudged off the other way . "  | Byron said , " We might have lost you and Mark Hartley . The thing was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Leslie prevented that . He stood his ground , at least , though he was shaking like a leaf . He did his plain duty . But those other ambassadors and charges  --  well  --  " Natalie had begun to pace . " And my family in Medzice ! When I picture those kind , good people in the clutches of the Germans  --  but what 's the use ? It 's futile , it 's sickening , to dwell on that . " She threw up her hand in a despairing gesture and dropped in her chair , sitting on her legs with her skirt spread over them . Nothing of her was visible in the firelight but her face and her tensely clasped hands . She stared at the fire . " Speaking of old Slote , " she said after a long pause , in an entirely different tone , " what do you think of his proposal to make an honest woman of me ? " " I 'm not surprised . " " You 're not ? I 'm stunned . I never thought I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told me in Berlin he might marry you . He 'd be crazy not to , if he could . " " Well , he 's had that option open to him for a hell of a long time , dear . " She poured coffee and sipped , looking darkly at him over the rim of the cup . " Had a big discussion about me in Berlin , you two gentlemen , did you ? " " Not a big discussion . He mentioned that you were just as surly to him that last day in Konigsberg as you 'd been to me . " " I was feeling absolutely horrible that day , Briny . " " Well , that 's all right . I thought I might have offended you somehow , so I asked him . " " This is getting interesting . What else did Slote say about me ? " The low , vibrant voice , the amused glinting of her eyes in the firelight , stirred Byron . " That you were no girl for me to get involved with , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since he first laid eyes on you , " She uttered a low gloating laugh . " Two accurate statements , my pet . Tell me more . " " That 's about it . It was the same conversation in which he gave me the reading list . " " Yes , and was n't that pure Slote ? Coming it over you with his book learning ! An illuminating little incident , that . Did n't he really tell you all about us ? About him and me ? " Byron shook his head . Natalie said , " You would n't go and get us some brandy , would you ? I think I 'd like a little brandy . "  |p263He  raced down the stairs and up again , returning with a bottle and two shimmering snifters . Swirling the brandy round and round in her hands , looking into the balloon glass and rarely raising her eyes at him , Natalie broke loose with a surprising rush of words about her affair with Leslie Slote . It took her a long time . Byron said little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was a familiar tale of a clever older man having fun with a girl and getting snared into a real passion . Resolvingto marry him , she had made his life a misery . He did n't want to marry her , she said , simply because she was Jewish and it would be awkwardfor his career . That was all his clouds of words had ever come to . At last , with this letter , after thirty months , she had him where she wanted him . Byron hated every word of the story , yet he was fascinated , and grateful . The closemouthed girl was taking him into her life . These words , which could n't be unsaid , were ending the strange tension between them since Warsaw , their own little phony war  --  the long hostile silences in the library , her holing up in her room , her odd snappish condescension . As she talked , they were growing intimate as they never had become in a month of adventuring through Poland . Everything about this girl interested him . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , let it be that ! At least Byron was talking about Natalie Jastrow with Natalie Jastrow , and this was what he had been starved for . He was hearing this sweet rough voice with its occasionalNew Yorkisms , and he could watch the play of her free gesturing hand in the firelight , the swoop and sudden stop in the air of flat palm and fingers , her visible signature . Natalie Jastrow was the one person he had ever met who meant as much to him as his father did . In the same way , almost , he hungered to talk to his father , to listen to him , to be with him , even though he had to resist and withdraw , even though he knew that in almost every conversation he either offended or disappointed Victor Henry . His mother he took for granted , a warm presence , cloying in her affection , annoying in her kittenish changeability . His father was terrific , and in that way Natalie was terrific , entirely aside from being a tall dark girl whom he had hopelesslycraved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had met . " Well , there you have it , " Natalie said . " This mess has been endless , but that 's the general idea . How about some more of Aaron 's brandy ? Would n't you like some ? It 's awfully good brandy . Funny , I usually do n't care for it . " Byron poured more for both of them , though his glass was n't empty.  | " What I 've been puzzling about all day , " she said after a sip , " is why Leslie is throwing in the towel now . The trouble is , I think I know . " " He 's lonesome for you , " Byron said . Natalie shook her head . " Leslie Slote behaved disgustingly on the Praha road . I despised him for it , and I let him know I did . That was the turnaround . He 's been chasing me ever since . I guess in a way I 've been running , too . I have n't even answered half his letters . " Byron said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All he did  --  " " Shut up , Byron . Do n't be mealymouthed with me . All he did was turn yellow and use me as an excuse . He hid behind my skirts . The Swedishambassador all but laughed in his face . " She tossed off most of her brandy . " Look , physical courage is n't something you can help . It is n't even important nowadays . You can be a world leader and a cringing sneak . That 's what Hitler probably is . Still , it happened . It happened . I 'm not saying I wo n't marry Leslie Slote because shellfire made him panic . After all , he behaved well enough at the railroad station . But I do say that 's why he 's proposing to me . This is his way of apologizing and being a man . It 's not quite the answer to my maidenly prayers . " " It 's what you want . " " Well , I do n't know . There are complications . There 's my family . My parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love with a Christian . My father took to his bed for a week , though that bit of melodrama left me unmoved . Well , now there 's that whole fight again . And Leslie 's proposal is odd . It 's not very specific as to time and place . If I wrote him back yes , he might well get on his bicycle again . " " If he 's really that kind of fool , which I doubt very much , " Byron said , " you could just let him bicycle away . " " Then there 's Aaron . " " He 's not your problem . He ought to get out of Italy in any case . " " He 's very reluctant to go . " " Well , he survived while we were away . " " Oh , that 's what you think . You should have seen the library and study when I got back . Chaos . And he had n't written anything in weeks . Aaron should have gotten married ages ago . He did n't , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't even sharpen a pencil properly . " Byron wondered whether Natalie 's irritable garrulity was due to the brandy . She was gesturing broadly , talking breathlessly , and her eyes were wild . " And there 's still another complication , you know . The big-gest . " " What 's that ? "  |p265She  stared at him . " Do n't you know what it is , Briny ? Have n't you any idea ? Not the faintest inkling ? Come on now . Stop it . " He said or rather stammered , because the sudden penetrating sexualityin Natalie Jastrow 's glance made him drunk , " I do n't think I do . " " All right then , I 'll tell you . You 've done it , you devil , and you know it . You 've done what you 've wanted to do from the first day you came here . I 'm in love with you . " She peered at him , her eyes shining and enormous . " Ye gods , what a dumb stunned face . Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I just hope it 's true . " He got out of his chair , and went to her . She jumped up and they embraced . " Oh God , " she said , clinging to him , and she kissed him and kissed him . " You have such a marvellous mouth , " she muttered . She thrust her hands in his hair , she caressed his face . " Such a nice smile . Such fine hands . I love to watch your hands . I love the way you move . You 're so sweet . " It was like a hundred daydreams Byron had had , but far more intense and confusing and delicious . She was rubbing against him in crude sensual delight , almost like a cat . The brown wool dress was scratchy in his hands . The perfume of her hair could n't be daydreamed , nor the moist warm sweet breath of her mouth . Above all gleamed the inconceivablewonder that all this was happening . They stood embraced by the crackling flames , kissing , saying broken foolish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . Natalie pulled away . She ran a few steps and faced him , her eyes blazing . " Well , all right . I had to do that or die . I 've never felt anything like this in my life , Byron , this maddening pull to you . I 've been fighting it off and fighting it off because it 's no damn good , you know . You 're a boy . I wo n't have it . Not a Christian . Not again . And besides  --  " she put both hands over her face . " Oh . Oh ! Do n't look at me like that , Briny ! Go out of my bedroom . " Byron turned to go , on legs almost caving under him . He wanted to please her . She said in the next breath , " Christ , you 're a gentleman . It 's one of the unbelievable things about you . Would you rather stay ? My darling , my love , I do n't want to put you out , I want to talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that 's all . And I do n't want to make any false moves . I 'll do anything you say . I absolutely adore you . " He looked at her standing in the firelight in the long wool dress with her arms crossed , one leg out to a side , one hip thrust out , a typical Nataliepose . He was dazed with happiness beyond imagining , and flooded with gratitude for being alive . " Listen  --  would you think of marrying me ? " Byron said . Natalie 's eyes popped wide open and her mouth dropped . Byron could not help it ; he burst out laughing at the comic change of her face , and that made her laugh crazily too . She came to him , almost flung herself at him , still laughing so uproariously that she could hardly manage to kiss him . " God in heaven , " she gasped , twining him in her arms , " you 're incredible . That 's two proposals in one day for la Jastrow ! It never rains but it pours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . " I do n't know why we 're laughing . I want to marry you . It 's always seemed preposterous , but if you really do love me  --  " " It is preposterous "  --  Natalie spoke with her lips to his cheek  --  " preposterousbeyond words , but where you 're concerned I appear to be quite mindless , and perhaps  --  well ! Nobody can say you 're a beardless boy , anyway ! Quite sandpapery , are n't you ? " She kissed him once more , hard , and loosened her arms . " The first idea was right . You leave . Goodnight , darling . I know you 're serious , and I 'm terribly touched . One thing we 've got in this godforsaken place is time , all the time in the world . " In the darkness , on his narrow bed in the tiny attic room , Byron lay wide awake . For a while he heard her moving about below , then the house was silent . He could still taste Natalie 's lips . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valley donkeys hee-hawed to each other across the echoing slopes , a misguided rooster hailed a dawn hours away , and dogs barked . There came a rush of wind and a long drumming of rain on the tiles , and after a while water dripped into the pail near his bed , under the worst leak . The rain passed , moonlight shafted faint and blue through the little round window , the pattering in the pail ceased , and still Byron lay with open eyes , trying to believe it , trying to separate his dreams and fantasies of half a year from the real hour when Natalie Jastrowhad overwhelmed him with endearments . Now his feverish mind ran on what he must do next . The window was turning violet when he fell asleep in a jumble of ideas and resolves , ranging from medical school and short-story writing to the banking business in Washington . Some distant cousins of his mother did control a bank . Hi , Natalie . " " Oh , hi there . Sleep well ? " It was almost eleven when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he had not come down this late before . Three books lay open on Natalie 's desk , and she was typing away . She gave him one ardent glance and went on with her work . Byron found on his desk a mass of first-draft pages heavily scribbled with Jastrow 's corrections , top267which was clipped a note in red crayon : Let me have this material at lunch , please . " A.J. looked in here ten minutes ago , " Natalie said , " and made vile noises . " Byron counted the pages . " He 's going to make viler ones at lunch . I 'm sorry , but I did n't close my eyes till dawn . " " Did n't you ? " she said , with a secret little smile . " I slept exceedingly well . " With a quick shuffling of papers and carbon he began to type , straininghis eyes at Jastrow 's scrawl . A hand ran through his hair and rested warmly on his neck . " Let 's see . " She stood over him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the old brown dress over her left breast was the gold brooch with purple stones from Warsaw . She had never before worn it . She glanced through the pages and took a few . " Poor Briny , why could n't you sleep ? Never mind , type your head off , and so will I. " They did not finish the work before lunch , but by then , as it turned out , Dr. Jastrow had other things on his mind . At noon , an enormous white Lancia rattled the gravel outside the villa . Byron and Natalie could hear the rich voice of Tom Searle and the warm hard laugh of his wife . Celebrated American actors , the Searles had been living off and on for fifteen years in a hilltop villa not far from Jastrow 's . The woman painted and gardened , while the man built brick walls and did the cooking . Endlesslythey read old plays , new plays , and novels that might become plays . Other celebrities came to Siena just to see them . Through them Jastrow had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Picasso . A retired college professor would have been a minnow among these big fish ; but the success of A Jew 's Jesus had put him fairly in their company . He loved being part of the celebrities ' group , though he grumbled about the interference with his work . He often drove down to Florence with the Searles to meet their friends , and Natalie and Byron thought the actors might be passing by now to fetch him off . But coming down for lunch , they found A.J. alone in the drawing room , sneezing , red-nosed , and waving an emptied sherry glass . He complained that they were late . In fact they were a bit early . " The Searles are leaving , " he said when lunch was over , having sneezed and blown his nose all through the meal without uttering a word . " Just like that . They came to say good-bye . " " Oh ? Are they doing a new play ? " said Natalie . " They 're getting out . Lock , stock , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States . "  | " But does n't their lease run for  --  how many more years ? Five ? " " Seven . They 're abandoning the lease . They ca n't afford to get stuck here , they say , if the war spreads . " Jastrow morosely fingered his beard . " That 's one difference between leasing and buying . You just walk away . You do n't bother your head about what happens to the place . I must say they urged me to lease . I should have listened to them . But the purchase price was so cheap ! " Byron said , " Well , sir , if you think there 's any danger , your skin comes first . " " I have no such fears . Neither have they . For them it 's a matter of business . We 'll have our coffee in the lemon house . " With a peevish toss of his head , he lapsed into silence . The lemon house , a long glassed-in structure with a dirt floor , full of small potted citrus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town and the rounded brown hills . Sheltered here from cold winds that swept up the ravine , the trees throve in the pouring sunlight , and all winter long blossomed and bore fruit . Jastrow believed , contrary to every medical opinion , that the sweet heavy scent of the orange and lemon blooms was good for the asthma that hit him when he was nervous or angry . Possibly because he believed this , it tended to work . His wheezing stopped while they drank their coffee . The warm sun cheered him up . He said , " I predict they 'll sneak back in short order with their tails between their legs , and three vans of furniture toiling up the hill . They remind me of the people who used to go fleeing off Martha 's Vineyard at the first news of a hurricane . I sat through four hurricanes and thoroughly enjoyed the spec-tacle . " Natalie said after he left , " He 's badly shaken . " " I hope he gets shaken loose from here . " " Dear , this house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " So what ? " " You 've never owned anything , have you , Briny ? Or saved any money . Once you have , you may understand . " " Look , Natalie , A.J. had a windfall late in life and got carried away and bought himself a big Italian villa for a song , in a lonesome mountain town . All right . Suppose he walks away now ? If he offers it for sale he 'll get something for it . Otherwise he can return after the war and put it back in shape . Or he can just forget it , and let it fall down . Easy come , easy go . " " You see things so simply , " she said . They were sitting side by side on a white wicker couch . He started to put his arm around her . " Stop that , " she said , catching her breath andp269deflecting his arm . " That 's too simple , too . Listen carefully , Byron . How old are you ? Are you twenty-five yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough for you , Natalie . " " Old enough for what ? To sleep with me ? Do n't talk rubbish . The question is , what are you doing with yourself ? I can teach at a university anytime . I 've got my M.A. thesis almost finished . What have you got ? A smile that drives me mad and a handsome head of hair . You 're brave , you 're gentle , but you just drifted here . You only stayed because of me . You 're killing time and you 're trained for nothing . " " Natalie , how would you like to be married to a banker ? " " A what ? A banker ? " He told her about his relatives and their bank in Washington . Hands folded in her lap , she beamed at him , her face aglow in the sunshine . " How does that sound ? " he said . " Oh , fine , " she said . " You 're really facing up to life at last . A stern , serious business , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What ? " " Tell me when you decided you liked me . " " Do n't you want to discuss this bank idea ? " " Of course , dear . All in good time . When was it ? " " All right , I 'll tell you . When you took off your sunglasses . " " My sunglasses ? When was that ? " " Why , that first day , when we came into the villa with Slote . Do n't you remember ? You had these big dark glasses on in the car , but then you took them off , and I could see your eyes . " " So ? " " You asked me when I fell in love with you . I 'm telling you . " " But it 's so absurd . Like everything else you say and do . What did you know about me ? Anyhow , my eyes must have been totally bloodshot . I 'd been up till four , having one hellish row with Leslie . You struck me as nothing at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now look , you do n't really want to be a banker , do you ? " He said with an abashed grin , " Well , I did think of one other thing . But do n't laugh at me . " " I wo n't . " " I thought of the Foreign Service . It 's interesting and it 's serving the country . " " You and Leslie in the same service , " she said . " That would be a hot one . " She took his hand in a maternal way that depressed Byron . " This is n't much fun for you , Briny dear , all this serious talk . " " That 's okay , " Byron said . " Let 's go right on with it . "  |p270For  a moment she sat pondering , holding his hand in her lap , as she had in the Swedish ambassador 's limousine . " I 'd better tell you what I really think . The trouble is you are trained for something . You 're a naval officer . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that I 've made a career of not being . " " You already have a commission . " " I 'm just a lowly reserve . That 's nothing . " " If the war goes on , you 'll be called up . You 'll stay in for years . That 's what you 'll probably be in the end , from sheer inertia , and family custom , and the passing of time . " " I can resign my reserve commission tomorrow . Shall I ? " " But suppose we get in the war ? What then ? Would n't you fight ? " " There 's nothing else to do then . " She put her hand in his hair , and yanked it . " Yes , that 's how your mind works . Well , I love you for that , and for other things , but Byron , I 'm not going to be the wife of a naval officer . I ca n't think of a more ridiculousand awful existence for me . I would n't marry a test pilot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " It 's no issue , I tell you , I 'll never be a naval officer  --  what the devil ? Now what ? Why are you crying ? " She dashed the sudden tears from her face with the back of her hand , smiling . " Oh , shut up . This is an insane conversation . The more I try to make sense , the wilder it all gets . All I know is that I 'm crazy about you . If it 's a dead end , who cares ? I obviously thrive on dead ends . No , not now , love , really , no  --  " She gasped the last words as he firmly took her in his arms . There was nobody in sight . Beyond the glass there was only the panoramaof hills and town , and inside the lemon house silence and the heavy sweet scent of the blossoms . They kissed and kissed , touching and holding and gripping each other . Soon Natalie happened to glance up and there stood the gardener Giuseppe outside the glass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With a squinting inebriated leer , he wiped a sleeve of his sweater across his knobbed nose , and obscenely winked . " Oh , Jesus Christ , " she said , yanking angrily at her skirt . The gardenershowed sparse foul teeth in a grin and trundled the wheelbarrow away . Byron sat flushed , dazed , and dishevelled , looking after him . " Well , there goes our little secret , sweetheart . Kissing and smoochingunder glass ! What 's happened to me ? This whole thing is a plain brute attraction between two people isolated together too long . " She leaped to her feet and pulled at his hand . " But I love you . I ca n't helpp271it . I do n't want to help it . Oh , that son of a bitch Giuseppe ! Come , let 's get back to the rock pile . We must . " Jastrow called from his study as they came into the house , " Natalie , where is your letter ? May I read it ? " " What letter , A.J. ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you sure ? I have one from your mother . She says she 's written you another and much longer one . Come read this . It 's important . " He waved a flimsy airmail sheet as Byron went upstairs . There were only half a dozen lines in her mother 's neat featureless writing , a Manhattan public school script : Dear Aaron : We would both appreciate it if you would urge Natalie to come home . Louis took that story of her trip to Poland very hard . The doctor even thinks that it may have been the cause of this attack . I 've written Natalie all about it . You may as well read that letter , there 's no sense in my repeating the whole terrible story . In retrospect , we were very lucky . Louis seems in no immediate danger , but that 's all the doctor will tell us . We 're all wondering how long you yourself intend to stay on in Italy . Do n't you feel it 's dangerous ? I know that you and Louis have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does worry about you . You 're his one brother . Love , Sophie and LouisNatalie checked the mail piled on her desk in the library , but there was only one letter for her , from Slote . Looking up from his work , Byron saw her somber expression . " What is it , Natalie ? " " It 's my father . I may have to leave . " The letter from her mother arrived two days later . Meantime Natalie resumed a certain aloofness toward Byron , though she still wore the brooch , and looked at him with changed eyes . She took the long and somewhat frantic account of her father 's heart attack to Jastrow , who was having his tea by the fire in the study , wrapped in a shawl . He shook his head sympathetically over it and handed it back to her . Gazing at the fire and sipping tea , he said , " You had better go . " " Oh , I think so . I 'm practically packed . " " What was Louis 's trouble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brothers were deeply estranged  --  Natalie did not know exactly why  --  and this breaking of their long tacit silence about her father gave her an awkward , unpleasant sensation.  | " No , not really . The trouble was my announcement that I was in love with Leslie . Papa got awfully weak and had breathing difficulty and a blackout episode . But he was n't hospitalized that time . " Jastrow pensively fingered hs beard . " He 's only sixty-one . You know , it gets to be suspenseful , Natalie , this question of whose heredity you 've got . Our mother 's family mostly popped off in their fifties . But Father 's two brothers both made it past ninety and he reached eighty-eight . My teeth are like my father 's . I have excellent teeth . Louis always had a lot of trouble with his teeth , the way Mama did . " Jastrow became aware of the girl 's dark watchful regard . He made a little apologetic gesture with both hands . " You 're thinking what a self-centered old horror A.J. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all . " Jastrow put on cotton gloves to poke at the fire and throw on a fresh log . He was vain about his small finely shaped hands . " You wo n't come back . I know that . Life will get difficult here . Possibly I could go to New Mexico or Arizona . But they 're such dull , arid , zero-culture places ! The thought of trying to write there ! " He gave a deep sigh , almost a groan . " No doubt my books are n't that important . Still , the work is what keeps me going . " " Your books are important , A.J. " " Are they ? Why ? " Natalie sat leaning her chin on a fist , groping for an honest and preciseanswer . She said after a pause , " Of course they 're extremely readable , and often brilliant , but that 's not their distinction . Their originality lies in the spirit . The books are very Jewish . In a creditable , unsentimental way , in substance and in attitude . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very much Christendom owes this bizarre little folk we belong to . It 's surprising how much of that you 've gotten even into the Constantine book . " Her words had a remarkable effect on Aaron Jastrow . He smiled tremulously , his eyes misted , and he all at once did look strikingly Jewish  --  the mouth , the nose , the expression , the soft white hand at his beard , were all features of a hatless little rabbi . He spoke in a soft shaky voice . " Of course you know exactly what to say to please me . " " That 's what I think , Aaron , " " Well , bless you . I 've evolved into a pagan , a materialist , and a hedonist  --  andI fell in love with the grandeur of Christianity and of Jesus long long ago  --  but none of that has made me less Jewish . Nobody else in the family will accept that , your father least of all . I 'm so grateful that you can . I truly think that the books on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to get them done . In my way I 'm bearingp273witness , as my rabbinic forebears did in theirs . Though no doubt they 'd he horrified by me . " He studied her face . He smiled , and his eyes began to twinkle . " How long after you left would Byron remain ? He gives me such a secure feeling , just by being here . " " Give him a raise in salary . That 'll convince him more than anything . He 's never earned a penny before . " Jastrow pursed his lips , rounded his eyes , and tilted his head . Many years of living in Italy showed in the mannerism . " I have to watch my money now . We 'll see . My strong impression is , actually , that you 'll marry Leslie once you get back there , and  --  oh , stop blushing and looking so coy . Have I hit it ? " " Never mind , A.J. " " I 'm sure if Byron were aware of that , he 'd be more likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiling at her . " Good God , Aaron ! Do you expect me to tell Byron Henry I 'm going to marry Slote , just to make him stay with you ? " " Why , my dear , whoever suggested such a thing ? Wait  --  my point is  --  " Jastrow stretched out a hand and looked after her , utterly astonished at her abrupt walkout.  |p274my  cow ! " Byron exclaimed . " There 's my father , or his double . " I I " Where ? " said Natalie . Her flight was delayed , and they were drinkingcoffee in the Rome airport at a table outside a little cafe ; the same cafe where they had lunched before setting off for Warsaw . " Inside that ring of carabinieri over there . " He pointed to a group of men leaving the terminal , escorted by six deferential police officers . Some of the party wore the green uniform of the foreign ministry ; the rest were in civilian clothes . The military bearingof a short broad-shouldered man , in a pepper-and-salt suit and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood , saying , " Can it be him ? But why the devil did n't he write or wire me that he was coming to Italy ? I 'll take a look . " " Briny ! " He was starting to lope away ; he stopped short . " Yes ? " " If it is your father  --  I 'm so tacky and sooty from that horrible train ride , and he 's obviously busy . " Natalie , usually so self-assured , suddenly looked confused and nervous , in an appealing , pathetic way . " I was n't expecting this . I 'd rather meet him another time . " " Well , let 's see if it 's him . " Victor Henry heard the voice behind him just as the party reached the exit doors . " Dad ! Dad ! Wait up ! " Recognizing the voice , Pug turned , waved , and asked his escort from the ministry to wait for him . " D'accordo . " The Italian smiled and bowed , eyeing sharply the young man who was hurrying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Commander , and meet you outside . There is plenty of time . " The father and son clasped hands . " Well , how about this ? " Victor Henry said , looking up at Byron 's face , with affection he usually concealedwhen less surprised . " What 's up , Dad ? Could n't you let me know you were coming ? " " It happened sudden-like . I intended to ring you tonight . What are you doing down here in Rome ? " " Natalie 's going home . Her father 's sick . "  | " Oh ? Has she left already ? " " No . That 's her , sitting over there . " " That 's the famous Natalie Jastrow ? The one in gray ? " " No , further over , in black . With the big hat . " Victor Henry caught a new proprietary note in his son 's voice . The listless , hangdog air of his Berlin days had given way to a confident glance and a straighter back . " You 're looking mighty bright-eyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marvellous . " " I 'd like to meet that girl . " The father suddenly strode toward her , so fast that Byron had to take a running step or two to catch up . There was no stopping him . They came and faced Natalie , who remained seated , hands clasped in her lap . " Natalie , this is Dad . " With such a flat introduction these two people , the opposed poles in Byron 's life , all at once confronted each other . Natalie offered her hand to Byron 's father , looked him in the eye , and waited for him to speak . At first sight , Victor Henry was taken by this weary-looking travel-stained girl with the dark eyes and gaunt face . She was not the legendary adventurousJewess he had built up in his imagination ; she had an everyday American look ; but withal there was a certain exotic aura , and a strong calm feminine presence . She must be feeling highly self-conscious , he thought , but there was no sign of it . In her slight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a trace of reflected affection for Byron . He said , " I 'm sorry to hear about your father . " She nodded her thanks . " I do n't know how bad it is . But they want me at home , and so I 'm going . " Her low voice was sweet , yet as firm as her look . " Are you coming back ? " " I 'm not sure . Dr. Jastrow may be returning to the States too , you see . " " He 'd be well advised to do that , fairly fast . " Pug was looking keenly at her , and she was meeting his glance . When neither found more to say for the moment , it became a sort of staring contest . Soon Natalie smiled a broad , wry , puckish smile , as though to say  --  " All right , you 're his father and I do n't blame you for trying to see what 's there . How do you like it ? " This disconcerted Victor Henry . He seldom lost such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Byron , who was watching with lively interest , struck by Natalie 's swift recovery of herp276poise . " Well , Briny , " he almost growled , " I ought to mosey along , and not keep that foreign ministry type waiting . " " Right , Dad . " Natalie said , " Byron told me that you became friendly with the Tudsburysin Berlin , Commander . I know Pamela . " " You do ? " Pug managed a smile . She was actually trying to put him at his ease with small talk , and he liked that . " Yes , in Paris she and I used to date two fellows who shared the same fiat . She 's lovely . " " I agree , and very devoted to her father . Maniacal driver , though . " " Oh , did you find that out ? I once drove with her from Paris to Chartres , and almost walked back . She scared me senseless . " " I 'd guess it would take more than that to scare you , " Pug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met you , even in this accidental way , Natalie . " Awkwardly , in almost a mumble , he added , " It explains a lot . Happy landings . Flying all the way ? " " I 've got a seat on the Thursday Clipper out of Lisbon . I hope I do n't get bumped . " " You should n't . Things are quiet now . But you 're well out of this continent . Good-bye . " " Good-bye , Commander Henry . " Victor Henry abruptly walked off , with Byron hurrying at his elbow . " Briny , what about you , now ? You 're staying on in Siena ? " " For the time being . " " Do you know that Warren 's engaged ? " " Oh , it 's definite now ? " " Yes . They 've set a date for May twentieth , after he finishes his carriertraining . I hope you 'll count on getting back by then . You wo n't see any more brothers ' weddings . I 'm working on a leave for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Mom ? " " Off her feed . Berlin 's getting her down . " " I thought she liked it . " " It 's becoming less likable . " They stopped at the terminal 's glass doors . " How long will you be in Rome ? " " If I can see you , Dad , I 'll just stay on till you 're free . " ' Well , fine . Check in at the embassy with Captain Kirkwood . He 's the naval attache . Could be we 'll dine together tonight . " " Great . " " That 's some girl . " Byron smiled uncertainly . " Could you really tell anything ? " " What you never said is that she 's so pretty . "  | " What ? I honestly do n't think she is . Not pretty , exactly . I 'm nuts about her , as you well know , but  --  " " She 's got eyes you could drown in . She 's stunning . However , what I wrote you about her long ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've seen her . She 's a grown-up woman . " He put his hand for a moment on Byron 's shoulder . " No offense . " " I love her . " " Well , we wo n't settle that question here and now . Go back to her , she 's sitting there all alone . And call Kirkwood about tonight . " " I will . " Natalie 's face was tense and inquiring when Byron came back . He fell into the chair beside her . " Gad , that was a shock . I still ca n't quite believe it . It all went so fast . He looks tired . " Do you know why he 's here ? " Byron shook his head slowly . She said , " I did n't picture him that way . He does n't look severe ; on the contrary , almost genial . But then when he talks he 's scary . " " He fell for you . " " Byron , do n't talk rot . Look at me . A soot-covered slattern . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I do n't believe it . What did he say ? " " I wo n't tell you . It 's embarrassing . I never heard him say anything like it before . What luck ! He likes you . Say , my brother 's getting married . " " Oh ? When ? " " In May . She 's the daughter of a congressman . She does n't seem all that concerned about marrying a naval officer ! Let 's make it a double wedding . " ' Why not ? You 'll be manager of a bank by then , no doubt . " They were both smiling , but the unsettled questions between them put an edge in their tones . It was a relief when the droning loudspeaker announced her flight . Byron carried her hand luggage and some fragile gifts for her family into the mill of jabbering , weeping passengers and relatives at the gate . Natalie was clutching her ticket , and trying to understand the shouts of the uniformed attendants . He attempted to kiss her , but it was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Natalie , " he said . She embraced him with one arm amid the jostling passengers , and spoke over the tumult . " It 's as well that I 'm going home just now , I think . Meantime I met your father ! That was something . He did like me ? Really ? " " You bowled him over , I tell you . And why not ? "  |p278The  crowd was starting to push through the gate . " How will I ever carry all this stuff ? Load me up , sweetheart . " " Promise me you 'll cable if you decide not to come back , " Byron said , poking bundles into her arms and under them . " Because I 'll take the next plane home . " " Yes , I 'll cable . " " And promise that you 'll make no other decisions , do nothing drastic , before you see me again . " " Oh , Byron , how young you are . All these damned words . Do n't you know how I love you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huge , her hands and arms piled , the green and yellow ticket sticking out of her fingers , she shrugged , laughed , and said , " Oh , hell . It 's a promise , but you know what Lenin said . Promises like piecrusts are made to be broken . Good-bye , my darling , my sweet . Good-bye , Byron . " Her voice rose as the press of passengers dragged her away . After a couple of hours of troubled sleep at the hotel , CommanderHenry put on a freshly pressed uniform , with shoes gleaming like black mirrors , and walked to the embassy . Under a low gray sky , in the rows of tables and chairs along the Via Veneto , only a few people were braving the December chill . The gasoline shortage had almost emptied the broad boulevard of traffic . Like Berlin , this capital city exuded penury and gloom . Captain Kirkwood had left for the day . His yeoman handed Pug a long lumpy envelope . Two small objects clattered to the desk when he ripped it open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a captain . Captain William Kirkwood presents his compliments to Captain Victor Henry , and trusts he is free to dine at nine , at the Osteria dell ' Orso . P.S. You 're out of uniform . Four stripes , please . Clipped to the note was a strip of gold braid , and the Alnav letter listing newly selected captains , on which Victor ( none ) Henry was ringed in heavy red lines . The yeoman 's refreshing , freckled American face wore a wide grin . " Congratulations , Cap'n . " " Thank you . Did my son call ? " " Yes , suh . He 's coming to dinner . That 's all arranged . Ah 've got fresh coffee going , suh , if you 'd like a cup in the cap'n 's office . "  | " That 'll be fine . " Sitting in the attache 's swivel chair , Pug drank one cup after anotherof the rich Navy brew , delightful after months of the German ersatz stuff . He ranged on the desk before him the eagles , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pale face looked calm , almost bored , as he swung the chair idly , contemplating the tokens of his new rank ; but he was stirred , exalted , and above all relieved . He had long been dreading that the selection board , on this first round , might pass him over . Execs of battleships and cruisers , squadron commanders of submarines and destroyers , insiders in BuShips and BuOrd , could well crowd out an attache . The big hurdle of the race for flag rank was early promotion to captain . The few officers who became admiralshad to make captain on the wing . This early promotion , this small dry irrevocable statistic in the record , was his guerdon for a quarter of a century of getting things done . It was his first promotion in ten years , and it was the crucial one . He wished he could share this cheering news at once with his restless wife . Perhaps when he got back to Berlin they could throw a wingding , he thought , for embassy people , correspondents , and friendly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Jew 's mansion in Grunwald . Natalie Jastrow popped back into his mind , displacing even the promotion . Since the chance encounter , he kept thinking of her . In those few minutes he had sensed the powerful , perhaps unbreakable , bond between his son and the girl . Yet how could that be ? Young women like Natalie Jastrow , if they went outside their natural age bracket , tended to marry a man almost his own age rather than to reach down and cradlesnatcha stripling like Byron . Natalie was more mature and accomplished than Janice , who was marrying Byron 's older brother . It was mismatch enough for these reasons , and made him wonder about her sense and stability , but the Jewish problem loomed above all . Victor Henry was no bigot , in his own best judgment . His narrowly bounded life had brought him into very little contact with Jews . He was an arid realist and the whole thing spelled trouble . If he were to have halfJewishgrandchildren , well , with such a mother they would probably be handsome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man enough to handle the complications and might never be . The coolness and courage he had displayed in Warsaw were fine traits for an athletic or military career , but in daily life they meant little , compared to ambition , industry , and common sense.  | " Mr. Gianelli is here , sir . " The yeoman 's voice spoke through the squawk box . " Very well . " Victor Henry swept up the tokens and put them in a trouser pocket , not nearly as happy as he had once thought promotion to captain would make him . The San Francisco banker had changed to an elegant doublebreastedgray suit with bold chalk stripes and outsize British lapels . The interior of his green Rolls Royce smelled of a strong cologne . " I trust you enjoyed your nap as much as I did mine , " he said , lighting a very long cigar . All his gestures had the repose , and all the details of his person  --  manicure , rings , shirt , tie  --  the sleekness , of secure wealth . Withal , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already spoken to the foreign minister . You 've met Count Ciano ? " Pug shook his head . " I 've known him well for many years . He 's definitely coming to the reception , and from there will take me to the Palazzo Venezia . Now , what about you ? What are your instructions ? " " To consider myself your aide as long as you 're in Italy and Germany , sir , and to make myself useful in any way you desire . " " Do you understand Italian ? " " Poorly , to say the least . I can grope through a newspaper if I have to . " " That 's a pity . " The banker smoked his cigar with calm relish , his drooping eyes sizing up Victor Henry . " Still , the President said there might be value in having you along at both interviews , if these heads of state will stand for it . Just another pair of eyes and ears . At Karinhall , of course , I can ask that you interpret for me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 'll have to feel our way as we go . This whole errand is unusual and there 's no protocol for it . Ordinarily I 'd be accompanied by our ambassador . " " Suppose I just come along , then , as though it 's the natural thing , unless they stop me ? " The banker 's eyes closed for several seconds , then he nodded and opened them . " Ah , here 's the Forum . You 've been in Rome before ? We 're passing the Arch of Constantine . A lot of old history here ! I suppose envoyscame to Rome in those days on errands just as strange . " Pug said , " This reception now , is it at your apartment ? " " Oh no , I keep just a very small flat off the Via Veneto . My uncle and two cousins are bankers here . It is at their town house , and the reception is for me . Let us just see how this goes . If , when we 're with Ciano , I touch my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along , in the way you suggest . "  |p281These  arrangements proved needless because Mussolini himself dropped in on the party . About half an hour after the arrival of the Americans , a commotion started up at the doorway of the enormous marblecolumnedroom , and Il Duce came walking bouncily in . He was not expected , judging by the excitement and confusion among the guests . Even Ciano , resplendent in green , white , and gold uniform , seemed taken aback . Mussolini was a surprisingly small man , shorter than Pug , dressed in a wrinkled tweed jacket , dark trousers , a sweater , and brown-andwhitesaddle shoes . It struck Pug at once that with this casual apparel Mussolini was underlining  --  perhaps for its eventual effect on the Germans  --  hiscontempt for Roosevelt 's informal messenger . Mussolini went to the buffet table , ate fruit , drank tea , and chatted jauntily with guests who crowded around . He moved through the room with a teacup , talking to one person and another . He glanced once at Luigi Gianelli as he passed close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In this setting Mussolinihardly resembled the chin-jutting imperial bully with the demonic glare . His prominent eyes had an Italian softness , his smile was wide , ironical , very worldly , and it seemed to Victor Henry that here was a smart little fellow who had gotten himself into the saddle and loved it , but whose bellicosity was a comedy . There was no comparing him with the ferocious I Iitler . Mussolini left the room while Pug was clumsily making talk with the banker 's aunt , a bejewelled , painted crone with a haughty manner , a peppermint breath and almost no hearing . Seeing the banker beckon to him and walk off after Ciano , Pug excused himself and followed . The three men went through tall carved wooden doors into a princely highceilingedlibrary , lined with volumes bound in gold-stamped brown , scarlet , or blue leather . Tall windows looked out over the city , which appeared so different from blacked-out Berlin , with electric lights twinkling and blazing in long crisscrossing lines and scattered clusters . Mussolini with a regal gesture invited them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , while Ciano and Victor Henry faced them in armchairs . Mussolini coldly stared at Henry and turned the stare to Gianelli . The look at once changed Pug 's impression of the Italian leader , and gave him a forcible sense that he was out of his depth and under suspicion . I le felt junior and shaky , an ensign who had blundered into flag country . ( ' iano had given him no such feeling , and still did n't , sitting there gorgeousand wary , the son-in-law waiting for the powerful old man to talk . At this close range Pug could see how white Mussolini 's fringe of hair was , how deep the creases of decision were folded in his face , how vivid were the large eyes , which now had an opaque glitter . This man could readily order a hundred murders , Pug decided , if he had to . He was an Italian ruler . Pug could half follow the banker 's clear , measured Italian as he rapidly explained that Franklin Roosevelt , his treasured friend , had appointedthe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Europe ; also that Henry would be acting as interpreter with Hitler . He said Henry could now remain or withdraw at II Duce 's pleasure . Mussolini gave the attache another glance , this time obviously weighing him as a Roosevelt appointee . His expression warmed . " Do you speak Italian ? " he said in good English , catching Henry unawaresalmost as though a statue had broken into speech . " Excellency , I can follow it in a fashion . I ca n't speak it . But then , I have nothing to say . " Mussolini smiled , as Pug had seen him smile at people in the other room . " If we come to naval matters maybe we will talk English . " He looked expectantly at the banker . " Bene , Luigi ? " The banker talked for about a quarter of an hour . Since Pug already knew the substance , the banker did not altogether lose him . After some compliments , Gianelli said he was no diplomat and had neither the credentialsnor the skill to discuss matters of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Il Duce , on behalf of the President . Mr. Roosevelt had sent a private citizen who knew II Duce , so that a negative replywould not affect formal relations between the United States and Italy . The President was alarmed by the drift toward catastrophe in Europe . If full-scale war broke out in the spring , horrors that nobody could foresee might engulf the whole world . Was it possible to do something , even at this late hour ? Mr. Roosevelt had in mind a formal , urgent mission by a high United States diplomat , somebody on the order of Sumner Welles ( Ciano , drumming the tips of his fingers together , looked up at the mention of the name ) , to visit all the chiefs of the warring states , perhaps late in January , to explore the possible terms of a general European settlement . 11 Duce himself had made a last-minute call for a similar exploration on August 31 , in vain . But if he would join the President now in bringing about such a settlement , he would hold a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deliberated for a minute or so , his face heavy , his shoulders bowed , his look withdrawn , one hand fiddling with his tweed lapels . Then he said  --  as nearly as Pug could follow him  --  that the foreign policy of Italy rested on the Pact of Steel , the unshakable tie with Germany . Any attempt , any maneuver , any trick designed to split off Italy from this al/Iiance would fail . A settlement in Europe was always possible . No one would welcome it more than he . As Mr. Roosevelt acknowledged , he himself had tried to the last to preserve the peace . But Hitler had offered a very reasonable settlement in October , and the Allies had spurned it . The American government in recent years had been openly hostile to Germany and Italy . Italy too had serious demands that had to be part of any settlement . These were not matters in Luigi 's province , Mussolini said , but he was stating them to clarify his very pessimistic feeling about a mission by Sumner Welles . " You have put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now , Luigi , I will put a question to you . " " Yes , Duce . " " Does this initiative come from President Roosevelt , or is he acting at the request of the Allies ? " " Duce , the President has told me this is his own initiative . " Ciano cleared his throat , leaned forward with his hands clasped , and said , " Do the British and French know and approve of this visit you are making ? " " No , Excellency . The President said that he would be making informalinquiries of the same nature , at this same time , in London and Paris . " Mussolini said , " The newspapers have no information on any of this , is that correct ? " " What I have told you , Duce , is known outside this room only to the President and his Secretary of State . My trip is a matter of private business , of no interest to the press , and so it will remain forever . " " I have stated my deep reservations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extremely formal tone . " I have very little hope that such a mission would be to any useful purpose , in view of the maniacal hostility of the British and French ruling circles to the resurgent German nation and its great Fuhrer . But I share Mr. Roosevelt 's sentiment about leaving no stone unturned . " He took a long portentous pause , then spoke with a decisivenod . " If the President sends Sumner Welles on such a mission , I will receive him . " Gianelli 's fixed smile gave way to a real one of delight and pride . He gushed over Mussolini 's wise and great decision , and his joy at the prospect of Italy and the United States , his two mother countries , joining to rescue the world from tragedy . Mussolini nodded tolerantly , seeming to enjoy the flood of flattery , though he waved a deprecating hand to calm down the banker . Victor Henry seized the first pause in the banker 's speech to put in , " Duce , may I ask whether Signor Gianelli is permitted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receive a formal mission by Sumner Welles ? " Mussolini 's eyes sparked , as sometimes an admiral 's did when Victor Henry said something sharp . He looked to Ciano . The foreign minister said condescendingly in his perfect English , " The Fiihrer will know long before you have a chance to tell him . " " Okay , " said Henry . Mussolini rose , took Gianelli 's elbow , and led him out through french doors to the balcony , letting a gust of cold air into the room . Ciano smoothed his thick black hair with both white hands . " Well , Commander , what do you think of the great German naval victory in the south Atlantic ? " " I had n't heard of one . " " Really ? It will be on Rome radio at seven o'clock . The battleship Graf Spee has caught a group of British cruisers and destroyers off Montevideo . The British have lost four or five ships and all the rest have been damaged . It 's a British disaster that changes the whole balance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but skeptical . " What happened to Graf Spee ? " " Minor hits that will be repaired overnight . Graf Spee was much heavier than anything it faced . " " The British have acknowledged this ? " Count Ciano smiled . He was a good-looking young man , and obviouslyknew it ; just a little too fat and proud , Pug thought , from living high on the hog . " No , but the British took a little while to acknowledge the sinking of the Royal Oak . " The dinner celebrating Victor Henry 's promotion began in gloom , because of the Graf Spee news . The two attaches sat talking over highballs , waiting for Byron to show up . Captain Kirkwood asserted that he believed the story ; that in the twenty years since the last war , a deep rot had eaten out the heart of England . Kirkwood looked like an Englishman himself  --  long-jawed , ruddy , and big-toothed  --  but he had little use for Great Britain . The British politicians had stalled and cringed in the face of Hitler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people no longer had a will to fight . The Limey navy was a shell . England and France were going to crumple under Hitler'sonslaught in the spring . " It 's too bad , I suppose , " Kirkwood said . " One 's sentiments are withp285the Allies , naturally . But the world moves on . After all , Hitler halted Communismin its tracks . And do n't worry , once he takes the fight out of the Allies , he 'll settle Stalin 's hash . The Russians are putting on one stumblehumperformance in Finland , are n't they ? They 'll be a walkover for the Wehrmacht . In the end we 'll have to make a deal with Hitler , that 's becomingobvious . He holds all the cards on this side of the water . " " Hi , Dad . " Byron 's sports jacket and slacks were decidedly out of place in this old luxurious restaurant , where half the people wore evening dress . Henry introduced him to the attache . " Where have you been ? You 're late . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the YMCA to flake out for a little while . " " Is that all you could find to do in Rome ? See a movie ? I wish I had a few free hours in this city . " " Well , see , I was tired . " Byron appeared much more his old slack self . The waiter now brought champagne and Kirkwood proposed a toast to Captain Victor Henry . " Hey , Dad ! Four stripes ! Really ? " Byron sprang to life , radiating sur- ' prised joy . He clasped his father 's hand and lifted a brimming glass . " Well ! I 'm sure glad I came to Rome , just for this . Say , I know one does n't mentionsuch things , but the hell with it , does n't this put you way out front , Dad ? " Captain Kirkwood said , " He 's been out front all along . That 's what this means . " " All it takes now is one false move , " said Pug dryly , shaking his head , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one helmsman doping off on the midwatch . You 're never out front till you retire . " " What 's your situation , by the way , Byron ? " Kirkwood said . The young man hesitated . " He 's ROTC , " Pug quickly said . " He 's got a yen for submarines . By the way , Briny , the New London sub school is doubling the enrollment in May and accepting any reserves that can pass the physical . " Kirkwood smiled , examining Byron with a shade of curiosity . " Now 's the time to get in on the ground floor , Byron . How 're your eyes ? Got twenty-twenty vision ? " " My eyes are okay , but I have this job to do here . " " What sort of job ? " " Historical research . " Kirkwood 's face wrinkled . Pug said , " He 's working for a famous author , Aaron Jastrow . You know , the one who wrote A Jew 's Jesus . "  | " Oh , Jastrow , yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with him at the embassy once . Brilliant fellow . Having some trouble getting back home , is n't he ? " Byron said , " He is n't having trouble , sir , he just does n't want to leave . " Kirkwood rubbed his chin . " Are you sure ? Seems to me that 's why he was in Rome . There 's a foul-up in his papers . He was born in Russia or Lithuania or somewhere , and  --  whatever it is , I guess something can be worked out . Taught at Yale , did n't he ? " " Yes , sir . " ' Well , he ought to make tracks while he can . Those Germans are just over the Alps . Not to mention old Benito 's anti-Jew laws . " Victor Henry was returning to Berlin that night by train , accompanyingthe banker . He said nothing about his mission in Rome to Kirkwoodor his son , and they did not ask . After dinner Byron rode to the railroadstation in the taxi with him , in a prolonged silence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cab , and neither one would start the topic . Pug said as they drove into the brilliantly lit empty square before the terminal , " Briny , if the British really took that shellacking off Montevideo , we wo n't stay out much longer . We ca n't let the Germans close the Atlantic . That 's 1917 again . Why do n't you put in for sub school ? It wo n't start till May . By then Jastro 'll be back in the States , if he is n't simple-minded . " " May 's a long way off . " " Well , I 'm not going to argue . " Pug got out of the cab . " Write to your mother a little more often . She 's not happy . " " Okay , Dad . " " Do n't miss Warren 's wedding . " " I 'll try not to . Gosh , wo n't that be something , if this family finally gets together again ? " " That 's why I want you there . It 'll be the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Good-bye . Listen , I 'm real proud you made captain , Dad . " Pug Henry gave his son a gloomy half-smile through the cab window and walked off to the train . And still not a word more had passed between them about the Jewish girl.  |p287So  irascibly did Rhoda Henry greet her husband on his return that he began to think something might be wrong with her . He had left her in a nervous slump . Everything was an aggravating mess , the fall weather in Berlin stank , life stank , she was bored , German efficiency was a fiction , nobody understood how to do anything right , and there was no service and no honesty anymore . She had " her pain , " an untreatable affliction that during previous slumps had showed up in an ann and in her back , and now was behind an ear . She feared cancer , but it did n't really matter because everything good was all finished anyway . Rhoda had always come out of these sags before , and then could be contritelysweet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rome that he would find her better when he got back . She was worse . She wanted to go with him to Karinhall . In his absence an invitation engraved in gold on creamy thick stationery , addressed to Commander Victor Henry , had been delivered by a Luftwaffe staff officer . Pug had n't been home ten minutes when she brought it out , wanting to know why she had n't been invited too . If he went to the Gorings ' party at Karinhalland left her behind , she said , she could never face anybody in Berlinagain . Pug could not disclose that he was going along for secret state purposes , as a flunkey to an international financier . He could n't take her into the snow-covered garden to soothe her with hints of this ; it was almost midnight , and she was wearing a cloudy blue negligee , in which , indeed , she looked very pretty . " Listen , Rhoda , take my word for it that there are security reasons for all this . " " Ha . Security reasons . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your way . " " I 'd rather have you along . You know that . " " Prove it . Call the protocol officer at the air ministry tomorrow . Or if you 're too bashful , I will . " Pug was conducting this conversation in the library , while glancingp288through piled-up mail . He put down the letters . After a minute of cold staring at his wife , he said , " Are you well ? " " I 'm bored to death , otherwise I 'm fine , why ? " " Have you been taking the iron pills ? " " Yes , but I do n't need pills . What I need is a little fun . Maybe I should go on a bender . " " You 're not calling the air ministry ! I hope that 's understood . " Rhoda made a mutinous noise , and sat pouting . " Hullo . Here 's a letter from that Kirby fellow . What 's he got to say for himself ? " " Read it . It 's as dull as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home , and how good the skiing is around Denver , and how much he enjoyed our hospitality . Three pages of nothing . " Pug tossed the letter unread on the routine pile . " Honestly , you 're a riot , you 're so predictable , Pug . For twenty-five years whenever you 've come home you 've gone straight for the mail . What are you expecting , a letter from a lost love ? " He laughed , and shoved the letters aside . " Right you are . Let 's have a drink . Let 's have a couple of drinks . You look wonderful . " " I do not . That goddamned hairdresser baked my hair into shredded wheat again . I 'm tired . I 've been waiting up to talk to you . You were two hours late . " " There was trouble at the passport office . " " I know . Well , I 'm going to bed . Nothing to talk about , since Karinhallis out . I even bought a sensational dress . I was going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'll send it back . " " Keep it . You might just find a use for it pretty soon . " " Oh ? Expect to be invited to the Gorings ' again ? " She went out withoutstaying for an answer . Pug prepared a couple of highballs to toast the news of his promotion . When he got upstairs , her light was out  --  an old unpleasant marital signal . He wanted very much to spend the night with his wife . Moreover , he had been saving the story of his encounter with Natalie Jastrow for their bedroomtalk . He drank both highballs himself , and slept on the sofa in the library . The next day was brightened for him by the German announcement that the Graf Spee had heroically scuttled itself after its historic victory , and that its commanding officer had then nobly shot himself in a hotel room . He heard over the BBC that three much lighter British vessels had in fact beaten the German warship in a running sea fight and sent it limpinginto port before the scuttling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and they were baffled by the revelation that the victorious pocket battleship had elected to blow itself up . The Nazi propagandists did not bother to explain , smothering the story instead with a whooping account of a vast fictitious air victory : twenty-five British bombers shot down over Heligoland . Pug knew that the chances of his ever meeting Count Ciano again were remote , but he would have given much to chat with him again about the Graf Spee . Also , when Rhoda learned of Pug 's promotion she came out of her blues as though by shock . Not another peep did she utter about Karinhall . She proceeded to give him the honeymoon treatment , and they had a happy week or so . His account of Natalie Jastrow fascinated and appalled her . " Sounds to me as though our only hope is that she 'll come to her senses and drop Briny , " she said . Il arinhall looked like a federal penitentiary built in the style of a hunting lodge . It sat in a game preserve about two hours ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and green firs mantled in snow . Off the autobahn , the approach ran through heavy gates electrically controlled , steel and concrete fences jagged with icicles , and a gauntlet of **27;13057;TOOLONG sentinels whose breaths smoked as they shouted challenges . Just as the car turned a corner and they caught a glimpse of the grandiose timber and stone building , a deer with big frightened eyes bounded across the road . The San Francisco banker no longer wore his automatic smile . His mouth was tightly pursed , and the soft brown Italian eyes were open wide and darting here and there , rather like the deer 's . In the vaulted banquet room , amid a dazzling crush of uniformed Nazis and their white-shouldered women  --  some lovely , some grossly fat , all brilliantly gowned and heavily gemmed  --  Adolf Hitler was playing with the little Goring girl . A string orchestra lost in a corner of the marble-paved expanse was murmuring Mozart . Great logs flamed in a fireplace with a triangular stone pediment soaring to the ceiling , and on a carved heavy table stretching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piled . Rich smells hung in the air : wood smoke , cigar smoke , roast meat , French perfume . The happy , excited crowd of eminent Germans were laughing , cooing , clapping hands , their eyes shining at their Leader in has plain field-gray coat and black trousers as he held the beautiful whitecladchild in his arms , talking to her , teasing her with a cake . Goring and his statuesque wife , both ablaze in operatic finery and jewelry , the man more showy than the woman , stood near , beaming with soft affectionate pride . Suddenly the little girl kissed the Fiihrer on his big pale nose , andp290he laughed and gave her the cake . A cheer went up , everybody applauded , and women wiped their eyes . " The Fiihrer is so wonderful , " said the Luftwaffe officer accompanyingthe two Americans , a small dark aviator wearing the diamond-studded cross of the Condor Legion . " Ach , if he could only marry ! He loves children . " And to Pug Henry , also , there was something appealing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the jocular reluctance with which he handed the girl to her ecstatic mother , his wistful shrug as he slapped airing 's back , like any bachelor congratulating a luckier man . At this moment Hitler had a naive , almost mushy charm . The Gorings escorted Hitler to the table , and this signalled a general swarming toward the buffet . A troop of lackeys in blue and gold livery marched in , setting up gilt tables and chairs , helping the guests to food , pouring the wine , bowing and bowing . Guided by the Luftwaffe officer , he and Gianelli landed at a table with a banker named Wolf Stoller , who hailed the American financier as an old acquaintance : a slight Teuton in his fifties , with sandy hair plastered close to his head . The wife , an ashenhairedbeauty , had eyes that glittered clear blue like the large diamonds on her neck , her arms , her fingers , and her ears . By chance , Victor Henry had just written a short report on Stoller and knew a lot about him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was amassing his riches . Stoller 's specialty was acquiring Objekte , the term in German business jargon for Jewish-owned companies forced to the wall . In the queer Germany of 1939 , which Victor Henry was just beginning to understand , there was much stress on legality in looting the Jews . Outright confiscation or violence were rare . New codes of law dating from 1936 simply made it hard for them to do business ; and month by month rulings came out making it ever harder . Jewish firms could n't get import or export licenses or raw materials . Their use of railroads and shipping was restricted . Conditions kept tightening until they had no course but to sell out . A market flourished in such Objekte , with many alert upperclassGermans bidding eagerly against each other . Wolf Stoller 's technique was to find and unite all the buyers interested in an Objekt , and to make a single very low offer . The owners had the choice of taking it or going bankrupt . Stoller 's group then divided up the firm in shares . Through airing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was usually first on the scent of a major Jewish firm buckling to its knees . The big prizes Goring bought up himself  --  metal , banking , textiles  --  or took a large participation.  |p291Stoller  's bank got its broker 's fees and also its own participations in the Objekte . All this Pug had learned from the American radio commentator in Berlin , Fred Fearing , who had been at some pains to dig it up . Fearing recounted it to him with deep anger , the more so as he could n't broadcast the story . The Germans claimed that any report of unfair treatment of the Jews was paid Allied propaganda . The Jewish laws aimed simply at restrictingthis minority , they said , to its due share in Germany 's economy . Pug had more or less shut his mind to the Jewish problem , so as to focus on the military judgments which were his job . Jews had become all but invisible in Berlin , except in their special shopping hours , when , pallid and harried , they briefly filled the stores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a highly visible affair ; Pug had never seen even the outside of a concentration camp . He had observed the signs on benches and restaurants , the white-faced worried wretches pulled off trains and airplanes , an occasional broken window or old charred synagogue , and once a bad business of a man beaten bloody in the zoo by three boys in Hitler Youth uniforms , while the man 's wife wept and screamed and two policemen stood by laughing . But Fearing 's account was his first technical insight into German anti-Semitism . At bottom its purpose , in Fearing 's view , was just robbery , which was disgusting but at least rational . Pug felt a qualm when Wolf Stoller with a cultured bow offered his hand , but of course he took it ; and soon there they sat eating together and toasting each other in Moselle , Riesling , and champagne . St011er was a cordial , clever German , in every way indistinguishable from the hundreds that Victor Henry had met in the military and industrialworlds and at social gatherings . He spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He made bright jokes , including bold pleasantries about airings corpulence and theatrical uniforms . He expresseddeep regard for the United States ( he especially loved San Francisco ) and melancholy regret that its relations with Germany were not better . In fact , could he not do something to improve them , he said , by invitingGianelli and the Henrys for a weekend at his estate ? It was no Karinhall , but he could promise them good company . Captain Henry might have the luck to shoot a deer . Game was outside the meat ration , and some venison might be very welcome to Mrs. Henry ! The banker 's wife , touching Pug 's hand with her cool jewelled white fingers , crinkledher blue eyes at him in invitation . She had heard that Mrs. Henry was the most elegant and attractive wife in the American diplomatic mission , and she longed to meet her . Gianelli declined ; he had to start his return journey in the morning.  |p292Officially  there was every reason for Victor Henry to accept . Part of his job was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Stoller , but it occurred to him that here was a chance to give Rhoda the kind of fun she complained of missing . There was no telling good Germansfrom bad Germans . Stoller conceivably might be working for Goring under duress , though his wife in consequence dripped diamonds . Pug said he would come . The look the Stollers exchanged convinced him that none of this was casual . They were cultivating him . Stoller took the two Americans on a tour of Karinhall . Again Pug had the feeling that Nazi grandeur usually woke in him : the Hollywood impression , the sense of ephemeral , flamboyant make-believe , which persistedno matter how vast and solid the structures , how high the ceilings , how elaborate the decorations , how costly the art . The corridors and rooms of Karinhall seemed to go on for miles . Glass cases by the dozens displayed solid gold objects crusted with gems  --  vases , crosses , maces , swords , busts , batons , medals , books , globes  --  tributes to the field marshal from steel corporations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wedding , the birth of a child , the return of the Condor Legion from Spain . Italian and Dutch old masters crowded the walls , interspersed with the vapid calendarnudes of living Nazi-approved painters . Other reception rooms with nobody in them , almost as vast and ornate as the banquet hall , were hung with tapestries and flags , walled in wood , filled with statuary and jewelled suits of armor . Yet it all might almost have been papier-mache and canvas . Even the food on the banquet table had looked like a Cecil B. deMillefeast , and the pink meat inside the roast pig might instead have been wax or plaster . But Victor Henry well knew that he was looking at an immense treasure , mostly booty collected through Dr. Stoller . Moral considerations aside , the vulgar edifice disappointed Pug because Goring was supposed to stem from an aristocratic family . Even the admiring commentsof Luigi Gianelli had a strong tinge of irony . The Luftwaffe officer wearing the diamond cross caught up with them and whispered to Stoller . " Ah , what a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ German banker . " And you have n't begun to see the wonders of Karinhall . Captain Henry , my office will make all the arrangements to bring you and your dear wife on Friday to Abendruh , though I fear it will look rather pitiful after this . We will telephone you tomorrow . " Stoller accompanied the two Americans through more rooms and corridors , stopped at double doors of dark wood heavily carved with huntingscenes , and opened them on a timbered room with log-and-plaster walls , hung with antlers , stuffed heads , and animal hides . The dusty smellp293of the dead creatures was strong in the air . On either side of a roaringfire sat Ribbentrop and Goring . Hitler was not in the room . A long , crudely made wooden table and two low benches took up most of the floor space . Pug thought at once that this must be the main room of the old hunting lodge , around which the field marshal had constructed the banal palace . Here was the heart of Karinhall . Except for the glow from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold . Goring lolled on a settee with one thick white leather-booted leg off the floor , sipping coffee from a gold demitasse  --  part of a gold service on a low inlaid marble table . He nodded and smiled familiarly at Gianelli . Diamond rings bulged on three of the five fingers that held the cup . Ribbentropstared at the ceiling , hands interlaced across his stomach . The German banker introduced Victor Henry , backed out of the room , and closed the door . " You will have exactly seven minutes of the Fiihrer 's time to state your business , " said Ribbentrop in German . Gianelli stammered , " Excellency , permit me to reply in English . I am here in a private capacity , and I regard that much time as an extraordinary courtesy to my country and my President . " Ribbentrop sat with a blank face , looking at the ceiling , so Victor Henry ventured to translate . The foreign minister cut him off with a snapped sentence in perfect Oxford accents , " I understand English . " Goring said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Luigi . I have tried to invite you more than once . But this time you have come a long way for a short interview . " " May I say , Field Marshal , " the banker answered in broken German , " that I have seen millions of money made and lost in a conference lastinga few minutes , and that world peace is worth any effort , however un-promising . " " I am in complete agreement with that . " Goring motioned them to chairs placed near him . Ribbentrop , seizing the arms of his chair and closing his eyes , burst out in high rapid tones , in German , " This peculiar visitation is another studied insult by your President to the German head of state . Whoever heard of sending a private citizen as an emissary in such matters ? Between civilized countries the diplomatic structure is used . Germany did not withdraw its ambassador in Washington by choice . The United States first made the hostile gesture . The United States has allowed within its borders a boycott of German products and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The United States has revised its so-called Neutrality Act in blatant favor of the aggressors in this conflict . Germany did not declare war on England and France . They declared war on Ger-many . " The foreign minister stopped talking and sat with his eyes closed , the long-jawed haggard face immobile , some strands of the graying blond hair falling over his face . The California banker looked first at Goring , then at Victor Henry , clearly shaken . Goring poured himself more coffee . Concentrating with all his might , Victor Henry translated the foreignminister 's tirade . Ribbentrop did not correct or interrupt him . Gianelli started to talk , but Ribbentrop burst out again : " What purposecan be served by this maladroit approach , other than a further deliberate provocation , one more expression of your President 's highly dangerous contempt for the leader of a powerful nation of eighty million people ? " With a trembling wave of his hand at Henry to indicate that he understood , Gianelli said , " May I respectfully reply that  --  " The bright blue eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in still louder tones , " The willingness of the Fuhrer to give you a hearing in these circumstances is a testimony to his desire for peace that history will some day record . This is the sole value this peculiar interview possesses . " Goring said to the banker in a milder , but no more friendly tone , ' What is your purpose here , Luigi ? " " Field Marshal , I am an informal messenger of my President to your Fuhrer , and I have a single question to put to him , by my President 's instructions . To ask it , and to answer it , should take very little time . But by God 's grace it can lead to lasting historical results . " Victor Henry put this into German . " What is the question ? " Goring said . The banker 's face was going yellow . " Field Marshal , by my President'sorder , the question is for the Fuhrer , " he said hoarsely in German . " It is for the Fuhrer to answer , " Goring said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyway . What is the question ? " He raised his voice , fixing his gaze on the banker . Gianelli turned away from Goring 's eyes , which were lazily hard , licked his lips , and said to Henry , " Captain , I beg you to confirm my instructions to the great field marshal . " Victor Henry was rapidly calculating the situation , including the trace of physical danger which had shadowed his mind since passing through the outer fences of Karinhall . Goring , for all his gross jolly facade , was a tough and ugly brute . If this monstrously fat German , with the rouge-red face , thin scarlet lips , and small jewelled hands , wanted to harm them , diplomatic immunity was a frail shield here . But Pug judged thatp295his talk was cat-and-mouse fooling to kill time . He translated the banker 's answer under the straight stare of Goring , and added , " I confirm that the instructions are to put the question directly to the Fithrer , as Herr Gianelli already has done to his good friend Il Duce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him a favorable response . " " We know all that , " Ribbentrop said . " We know the question , too . " Goring blinked at Henry and the tension broke . The banker brushed his fingers across his brow . The silence lasted for perhaps a minute . Adolf Hitler , pulling a lock of hair across his forehead , came into the room through a side door hung with a tiger skin . As quickly as the Americans , Goring and Ribbentrop rose , assuming very much the lackey look . Goring moved away from the comfortable settee to a chair , and Hitler took his place , gesturing to the others to sit . He did not shake hands . Seen at this close range the Fuhrer looked healthy and calm , though too fat and puffy-eyed . His dark hair was clipped to the bone at the sides like a common soldier 's . Except for the famed moustache he had an ordinary face , the face of any small man of fifty or so walking by on a German city street . Compared to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed bedizened grotesques . His gray coat with the single Iron Cross over his left breast contrasted remarkably with Ribbentrop'sgold-braided dark blue uniform and the air marshal 's extravaganzaof colors , gems , and medals . Folding one hand over the other in his lap , he took in the Americans with a grave glance . " Luigi Gianelli , American banker . Captain Victor Henry , United States naval attache in Berlin , " said Ribbentrop , in a sarcastic tone emphasizingthe unimportance of the visitors . " Extraordinary informal emissaries , Mein Fillarer , from the President of the United States . " The banker cleared his throat , attempted an expression of gratitude for the interview in German , made a flustered apology , and shifted to English . The Filhrer , his gaze steady on the banker while Henry translated , kept shifting in his chair and crossing and uncrossing his ankles . With the same prologue on world peace that he had addressed to Mussolini , Gianelli put to the Fuhrer the question about Sumner Wales . As it came out in English , a contemptuous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ translation Hitler and Goring looked at each other , the Parer impassive , Goring hoisting his shoulders , waving his thick-gemmed hands , and shaking his head , as though to say , " That 's really it . Unbelievable ! " Hitler meditated . The glance of his sunken , pallid blue eyes was straight ahead and far away . A bitter little smile moved his moustache and his small mouth . He began to speak in quiet , very clear , Bavarian ,  | accented German , " Your esteemed President , Herr Gianelli , seems to feel a remarkable sense of responsibility for the whole present course of world history . It is all the more remarkable in that only the United States , among the great powers , failed to join the League of Nations , and in that your Congress and your people have repeatedly indicated that they want no foreign entanglements . " In my speech of April twenty-ninth , mainly addressed to your President , I acknowledged that your country has more than twice the populationof our little land , more than fifteen times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore your President feels that he must approach me from time to time with stern fatherly admonitions . But of course I am giving my life for the renascence of my people , and I can not help seeing everything from that limited point of view . " Victor Henry did his best to translate , his heart pounding , his mouth dry . Hitler now began reminiscing garrulously about the Rhineland , Austria , Czechoslovakia , and Poland . He spoke at length and seemed to be enjoying himself , slowly waving his hands and using relaxed tones . The justifications were familiar stuff . He grew briefly loud and acid only over the British guarantee to Poland , which , he said , had encouraged a cruel reactionary regime to engage in atrocious measures against its Germanminority , in the illusion that it had become safe to do so . That was how the war had started . Since then England and France had over and over spurned his offers of a peace settlement and disarmament . What more could he do , as a responsible head of state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two great military empires , who between them controlled three-fifths of the habitable surface of the earth and almost half its population ? German political aims were simple , open , moderate , and unchanging , he went on . Five centuries before Columbus discovered America , there had been a German empire at the heart of Europe , its boundaries roughly fixed by geography and the reproductive vigor of the people . War had come over and over to this European heartland through the attempts of many powers to fragment the German folk . These attempts had often had temporary success . But the German nation , with its strong instinct for survival and growth , had time and again rallied and thrown off foreignencirclements and yokes . In this part of his talk Hitler made references to Bismarck , Napoleon , Frederick the Great , the War of the Spanish Succession , and the Thirty Years ' War , which were beyond VictorHenry . He translated them word for word as best he could . The Versailles Treaty , said the Fiihrer , had simply been the latestp297of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been historically unsound and unjust it was now dead . The Rhineland was German . So was Austria . So was the Sudetenland . So were Danzig and the Corridor . The manufactured monstrosity of Czechoslovakia , thrust like a spear into Germany 's vitals , had now become once again the traditionalBohemian protectorate of the Reich . This restoration of normal Germany was now complete . He had done it almost without bloodshed . But for the absurd British guarantee , it would have all been finished in peace ; the question of Danzig and the Corridor had been practically settled in July . Even now nothing substantial stood in the way of lasting peace . The other side simply had to recognize this restored normality in central Europe , and return to Germany her colonial territories . For the Reich , like other great modem states , had a natural right to the raw materialsof the underdeveloped continents . Victor Henry was deeply struck by Hitler 's steady manner , by his apparent moral conviction , by his identification of himself with the Germannation  --  " ... and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . and so I brought back Austria to its historical origins . . . and so I normalized the Bohemian plateau . . . "  --  and by his broad visions of history . The rantingdemagogue of the Party rallies was obviously nothing but a public image , such as the Germans , in Hitler 's estimate , wanted . He radiated the personal force that Captain Henry had seen in only two or three admirals . As for the journalistic picture  --  the carpet-chewing hysterical Charlie Chaplin politician  --  Pug now felt that it was a distortion of small minds which had led the world into disaster . " I share the President 's desire for peace , " Hitler was saying . He was starting to gesture now as in his speeches , though less broadly . His eyes had brightened astonishingly ; Henry thought it must be an illusion , but they seemed eerily to glow . " I hunger and yearn for peace . I was a simple soldier in the front lines for four years , while he , as a rich and wellborn man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Navy in a Washington office . I know war . I was born to create , not to destroy , and who can say how many years of life are left to me to fulfill my tasks of construction ? But the British and French leaders call for the destruction of Hitlerism ' "  --  he brought out the foreign term with contemptfilledsarcasm  --  " as their price for peace . I can almost understand their hatredfor me . I have made Germany strong again , and that did not suit them . But this hate , if persisted in , will doom Europe , because I and the German people can not be separated . We are one . This is a simple truth , though I fear the English will need a test of fire to prove it . I believe Germany has the strength to emerge victorious . If not , we will all go down together , and historical Europe as we know it will cease to exist . " He paused , his face tightened and changed , and the pitch of his voice all at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so blind to realities ? I achieved air parity in 1937 . Since then I have never stopped building planes , planes , planes , U-boats , U-boats , U-boats ! " He was screaming now , clenching his fists and waving his stiff outstretched arms . " I have piled bombs , bombs , bombs , tanks , tanks , tanks , to the sky ! It has been a waste- , 1 staggering burden on my people , but what other language have great states ever understood ? It is out of a sense of strength that I have offered peace . I have been rejected and scorned , and as the price of peace they have asked for my head . The German people only laugh at such pathetic nonsense ! " On the shouted litany of " planes . . . bombs . . . U-boats " he swept both fists down again and again to strike the floor , bending far over so that the famous black lock of hair tumbled in his face , giving him his more usual newsreel look of the street agitator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something of the carpet chewer , after all . Suddenly , dramatically , as at a podium , he dropped into quiet controlled tones . " Let the test of fire come . I have done my utmost , and my conscience is clear before the bar of history . " Hitler fell silent , then stood with an air of dismissal , his eyes burning and distant , his mouth a down-curved line . " Mein Fiihrer , " Goring said , lumbering to his feet , his boots creaking , " after this wonderfully clear presentation of the realities you offer no objection to this visit of Herr Sumner Welles , I take it , if the President per-sists . " Hitler hesitated , appeared perplexed , and gave an impatient shrug . " I have no wish to return discourtesy for discourtesy , and petty treatmentfor petty treatment . I would do anything for peace . But until the Britishwill to destroy me is itself destroyed , the only road to peace is through Ger-I man victory . Anything else is irrelevant . I will continue to hope with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other side , before the holocaust explodes . " In a worked-up manner , with no gesture of farewell , he strode out through the carved double door . Victor Henry glanced at his wristwatch . The Fiihrer had spent an hour and ten minutes with them , and so far as Henry knew , President Roosevelt 's question remained unanswered . He could see on Gianelli 's pale , baffled face the same impression . Goring and Ribbentrop looked at each other . The fat man said , " President Roosevelt has his reply . The Fiihrer sees no hope in the Wellesp299mission , but in his unending quest for a just peace he will not reject it . " " That was not my understanding , " said Ribbentrop in a quick , strained voice . " He called the mission irrelevant . " " If you want to press the Fuhrer for clarification , " Goring said satiricallyto him , gesturing at the double doors , " go ahead . I understood him very well , and I think I know him . " He turned again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In informing your President of this meeting , tell him that I said the Fuhrer will not refuse to receive Welles , but sees no hope in it  --  and neither do I  --  unless the British and the French drop their war aim of removing the Fuhrer . That is no more possible than it is to move Mont Blanc . If they persist in it , the result will be a frightful battlein the West , ending in a total German victory after the death of mil-lions . " " That will be the result in any case , " said Ribbentrop , " and the die will be cast before Mr. Sumner Welles can arrange his papers and pack his belongings . " Goring took each of the two Americans by an elbow and said with a total change to geniality that brought to Victor Henry 's mind the waiter at Wannsee , " Well , I hope you are not leaving so soon ? We will have dancing a little later , and a bite of supper , and then some fine entertainers from Prague , artistic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Your Excellency is marvellously hospitable , " Gianelli replied . " But a plane is waiting in Berlin to take me to Lisbon and connect with the Clipper . " " Then I must let you go , but only if you promise to come to Karinhall again . I will walk out with you . " Ribbentrop stood with his back to them , looking at the fire . When the banker hesitantly spoke a word of farewell , he grunted and hitched a shoulder . Arm in arm with Goring , the Americans walked down the corridors of Karinhall . The air minister smelled of some strong bath oil . His hand lightly tapped Victor Henry 's forearm . " Well , Captain Henry , you have been to Swinemunde and seen our U-boat setup . What is your opinion of our U-boat program ? " " Your industrial standards are as high as any in the world , Your Excellency . And with officers like Grobke and Prien you 're in good shape . The U-boats are already making quite a record in the Atlantic . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " U-boats are coming off the ways now like sausages . I doubt that all of them will even see action . The air will decide this war fast . I hope your attache for air , Colonel Powell , has been reporting the Luftwaffe 's strength accurately to your President . We have been very open with Powell , on my orders . " p 300 " Indeed he has made reports . He 's very impressed . " Goring looked pleased . " We have learned a lot from America . Curtisin particular has brilliant designers . Your Navy 's dive-bombing was carefully studied by us and the Stuka was the result . " He turned to the banker and speaking in slow , simple German , asked him questions about South American mining companies . They were walking through an empty ballroom with huge crystal-and-gilt chandeliers , and their clicking steps on the parquet floor echoed hollowly . The banker replied in easy German , which he had not displayed under pressure , and they talked finance all the way to the front doors . Guests walking in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Americans . The banker 's man-of-the-world smile reappeared and color returned to his face . It was snowing outside , and Goring stopped in the doorway to shake hands . Gianelli had so far recovered that he came out with something Victor Henry considered absolutely vital . Henry was trying to think of a way to hint it to him , when the banker said , shaking hands with the air minister in a light whirl of snow , " Excellency , I will have to tell the Presidentthat your foreign minister does not welcome the Welles mission and has stated the Fuhrer does not . " Goring 's face toughened . " If Welles comes , the Fuhrer will see him . That is official . " Goring glanced up at the sky and walked through the snow with the two Americans to their car , as a Luftwaffe officer drove it up to the entrance . " Remember this . Germany is like all countries . Not everybodyhere wants peace . But I do . " Victor Henry sat up most of the night writing his report , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's hands . It was a longhand account , poured out pell-mell . After a tale of the facts up to Goring 's last words in the snow , Victor Henry wrote : The key question is , of course , whether or not a peace mission by Sumner Welles is now expected in the Third Reich . It seems inconceivablethat in an interview with Hitler , Goring , and Ribbentrop , your emissarygot no clear-cut answer . I believe that Sumner Welles will be received by Hitler . But I do n't think the mission will achieve anything , unless the Allies want to change their minds and accept some version of the " outstretchedhand " formula . None of the three men seemed to take the interview very seriously . They have bigger matters on their minds . We were a pair of nobodies . I would guess that Goring wanted it to take place , and that Hitler , being there in Karinhall anyway , did n't mind . I got the feeling that he enjoyedp301sounding off to a pair of Americans who would report directly to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the west is ready to roll . I do n't think they give a damn whether Welles comes or not . If the British are really as set on their terms as Hitler is on his , you 'll have all-out war in the spring . The parties are too far apart . Goring , it seems to me , is playing a side game by his peace talk . This man is the biggest thug in the Third Reich . He looks like a circus freak  --  the man is really disgustingly fat and dolled up  --  but he is the supreme realist in that crowd , and the unchallenged number two man . He has made a good thing out of Nazism , much more than the others . Mr. Gianelli will no doubt describe Karinhall to you . It 's vulgar but stupendous . Goring may be smart enough , even though he 's riding high , to figure that no string of luck lasts forever . If the offensive should happen to go sour , then the man who always wanted peace will be right there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the job . Ribbentrop can only be described=if you will forgive me , Mr. President  --  as the classic German son of a bitch . He is right out of the books with his arrogance , bad manners , obtuseness , obstinacy , and self-righteousness . I think this is his nature , but I also believe he echoes how Hitler feels . This is just the old Navy business of the commanding officer being the impressive " old man , " while the exec is the mean crab doing his dirty work . Hitler unquestionably hates your guts and feels you 've interfered and crossed him up far too much . He also feels fairly safe defying the USA , because he knows how public opinion is divided . All this Ribbentropexpressed for him in no uncertain terms , leaving the boss free to be the magnanimous German Napoleon and the savior of Europe . Driving away from Karinhall , I had a reaction like coming out of a trance . I began to remember things about Hitler that I really forgot while I was listening to him and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way he has broken his word time after time , his wild lies , the fact that he started this war , the gruesome bombing of Warsaw , and his persecution of the Jews . It 's a measure of his persuasiveness that I could forget such things for a while , facing the man who has done them . He 's a spellbinder . For big crowds I 've heard him do coarse belligerent yelling , but in a room with a couple of nervous foreigners he can be  --  if it suits him  --  the reasonable , charming world leader . They say he can also throw a foaming rage ; we saw just a hint of that , and I certainly believe it . But the picture of him as a ludicrous nut is a falsehood . He never sounded more confident than when he said that he and the Germans are one . He simply knows this to be the truth . Take away his moustache , and he sort of looks like all the Germans rolled into one . He is n't an aristocrat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whateverexcept the German man in the street , somehow inspired . It 's vital to understand this relationship between Hitler and the Ger- man people . The present aim of the Allies seems to be to pry the two apart. i I have become convinced that it ca n't be done . For better or worse , the Allies still have the choice of knuckling under to Hitler or beating the Germans . They had the same choice in 1936 , when beating the Germans would have been a cinch . Nothing has changed , except that the Germans may now be invincible . The glimpse of cross-purposes at the top may have showed a weaknessof the Nazi structure , but if so it 's all internal politics , it has nothing to do with Hitler 's hold on the Germans . That includes Goring and Ribbentrop . When he entered the room they stood and cringed . If Hider were the half-crazy , half-comical gangster we 've been readingabout , this war would be a pushover , because running a war takes brains , steadiness , strategic vision , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able man.  |p303RHoDA  hugged and kissed Pug when he told her about the weekend . He did n't mention Stoller 's part in what Fred Fearing called robbing the Jews . It was n't precisely that ; it was a sort of legalized expropriation , and damned unsavory , but that was life in Nazi Germany . There was no point in making Rhoda share his uneasy feelings , when one reason for accepting Stoller 's hospitality was to give her a good time . The chauffeur sent by Stoller drove past the colonnaded entrance to Abendruh and dropped them at a back door , where a maid conducted them two flights up narrow servants ' stairs . Pug wondered whether this was a calculated German insult . But the spacious , richly furnished bedroom and sitting room looked out on a fine snowy vista of lawn , firs , windingriver , and thatched outbuildings ; two servants came to help them dress ; and the mystery of the back stairs cleared up when they went to dinner . The curving main staircase of Abendruh , two stories high , balustraded in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wooden slide . Guests in dinner clothes stood on the brink , the men laughing , the ladies giggling and shrieking . Down below other guests stood with the Stollers , watching an elegantly dressed couple sliding down , the woman hysterical with laughter as her green silk dress pulled away from her gartered thighs . " Oh my gawd , Pug , I 'll Dm ! " chortled Rhoda . " I ca n't POSSIBLY ! I 've practically Noaxnve on underneath ! Why do n't they WARN a girl ! " But of course she made the slide , screaming with embarrassed delight , exposing her legs  --  which were very shapely  --  clear up to her lacy underwear . She arrived at the bottom scarlet-faced and convulsed , amid cheers and congratulations , to be welcomed by the hosts and introduced to fellow weekenders . It was a sure icebreaker , Victor Henry thought , if a trifle gross . The Germans certainly had the touch for these things . Next day when he woke he found a green leather hunting costume laid out for him , complete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men were a varied crowd : Luftwaffe and Wehrmacht officers , other bankers , the president of an electrical works , a prominent actor . Pug was the only foreigner . The jolly group took him warmly into their horseplay and jok- ing , and then into the serious business of the hunt . Pug liked duck-hunting , but killing deer had never appealed to him . General Armin von Roon was in the party , and Pug lagged behind with the hook-nosed general , who remarked that to see a deer shot made him feel ill . In this meeting Roon was more loquacious than before . The forest was dank and cold , and like the others he had been drinking schnapps . They talked first about the United States , where , as it turned out , Roon had attended the Army War College . Then the general discussed the Polish campaign , and the Ribbentrop-Molotov pact , which he surprisingly called a disaster , because of all the ground Stalin had gained without firing a shot . His grasp of the field operations was masterly . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and honest . Roon scarcely veiled his contempt for the master race theories of the Nazis , or for the Party itself , but he was making out a strong case for Hitler as a German leader , when shots rang out and a nearby hullabaloo drew them to join the party , ringed around a small deer lying dead in blood-spattered snow . A ceremony ensuedof horn-blowing and pushing a sprig of fir into the dead mouth over the bloody lolling tongue . Henry became separated from the general . That. evening he looked for him before dinner , and was sorry to learn that Roon had been summoned back to Berlin . After dinner , a string quartet played Beethoven in a cream-and-gold French music room , and a fat-bosomed famous soprano sang Schubert songs . The guests listened with more attention than Pug could muster ; some , during the lieder , had tears in their eyes . Rhoda felt in her element , for in Washington she was a patroness of music . She sat beaming , whisperingexpert comments between numbers . Dancing followed , and one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor , she kept darting sparkling looks of gratitude at her husband , until Stoller took him in tow to a library , where the actor and Dr. Knopfmann , the head of the electrical works , sat over brandy . As yet , on the weekend , Pug had not heard a word about the war . Conversation had stayed on personal chatter , business , or the arts . " Ah , here is Captain Henry , " said the actor in a rich ringing voice . " What better authority do you want ? Let 's put it to him . " A gray-moustachedman with thick hair , he played emperors , generals , and older men in love with young women . Pug had seen his famous King Lear at the Schauspielhaus . His face just now was purple-red over his staff collar and buckling starched shirt . " It might embarrass him , " Dr. Knopfmann said . " No war talk now . That 's out , " said Stoller . " This weekend is for pleasure . "  | " I do n't mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a leather chair . " What 's the question ? " " I create illusions for a living , " rumbled the actor , " and I believe illusionsshould be confined to the stage . And I say it is an illusion to hope that the United States will ever allow England to go down . " " Oh , to hell with all that , " said the banker . Dr. Knopfmann , a twinkling-eyed , round-faced man like the captain of the Bremen , but much shorter and fatter , said , " And I maintain that it is n't 1917 . The Americans pulled England 's chestnuts out of the fire once , and what did they get for it ? A bellyful of ingratitude and repudiation . The Americans will accept the fait accompli . They are realists . Once Europe is normalized , we can have a hundred years of a firm AtlanticDfpeace . " What do you say , Captain Henry ? " the actor asked . " The problem may never come up . You still have to lick England . " None of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Oh , I think we can assume that 's in the cards  --  providing the Americans do n't step in . That 's the whole argument . " Stoller said , " Your President does n't try to hide his British sympathies , Victor , does he ? Quite natural , in view of his Anglo-Dutch ancestry . But would n't you say the people are against him , or at least sharply split ? " " Yes , but America is a strange country , Dr. Stoller . Public opinion can shift fast . Nobody should forget that , in dealing with us . " The eyes of the Germans flickered at each other . Dr. Knopfmann said , " A shift in public opinion does n't just happen . It 's manufactured . " " There 's the live nerve , " Stoller said . " And that 's what I 've found difficult to convey even to the air marshal , who 's usually so hardheaded . Germans who have n't been across the water are impossibly provincial about America . I 'm sorry to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe he yet truly grasps the vast power of the American Jews . It 's a vital factor in the war picture . " " Do n't exaggerate that factor , " Henry said . " You fellows tend to , and it 's a form of kidding yourselves . " " My dear Victor , I 've been in the United States nine times and I lived for a year in San Francisco . Who 's your Minister of the Treasury ? The Jew Morgenthau . Who sits on your highest court , wielding the most influence ? The Jew Frankfurter . " He proceeded to reel off a list of Jewish officials in Washington , stale and boring to Pug from endless repetition in Nazi propaganda ; and he made the usual assertion that the Jews had American finance , communications , justice , and even the Presidency in their pockets . Stoller delivered all this calmly and pleasantly . He kept repeating " Der Jude , der Jude " without a sneer . There was no glare in his eye , such as Pug had now and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presented his statements as though they were the day 's stock market report . " To begin with , " Pug replied , a bit wearily , " the Treasury post in our country has little power . It 's a minor political reward . Christians hold all the other cabinet posts . Financial power lies with the banks , the insurance companies , the oil , rail , lumber , shipping , steel , and auto industries , and such . They 're wholly in Christian hands . Always have been . " " Lehman is a banker , " said Dr. Knopfmann . " Yes , he is . The famous exception . " Pug went on with his stock answers to stock anti-Semitism : the all but solid Christian ownership of newspapers , magazines , and publishing houses , the Christian composition of Congress , the cabinet , and the executive branch , the eight Christian judges out of nine on the Supreme Court , the paramount White House influence of a Christian , Harry Hopkins , and all the rest . On the faces of his hearers appeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , facetious , and cold , with superior awareness of a very private inside joke . Stoller said in a kindly tone , " That 's always the Jewish line , you know , how unimportant they are . " " Would you recommend that we take away what businesses they do have ? Make Objekte of them ? " Stoller looked surprised and laughed , not in the least offended . " You 're better informed than many Americans , Victor . It would be an excellent idea for the health of your economy . You 'll come to it sooner or later . " " Is it your position , " the actor said earnestly , " that the Jewish questionreally has no bearing on America 's entry into the war ? " " I did n't say that . Americans do react sharply to injustice and suf-fering . " The smirk reappeared on the three faces , and Knopfmann said , " And your Negroes in the South ? " Pug paused , " It 's bad , but it 's improving , and we do n't put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lowered voice , " That 's a political penalty . A Jew who behaves himself does n't go to a camp . " Lighting a large cigar , his eyes on the match , Stoller said , " Victor speaks very diplomatically . But his connections are okay . One man who 's really in the picture is Congressman Ike Lacouture of Florida . He foughtp307a great battle against revising the Neutrality Act . " With a sly glance at Pug , he added , " Practically in the family , is n't he ? " This caught Pug off guard , but he said calmly , " You 're pretty well informed . That 's not exactly public knowledge . " Stoller laughed . " The air minister knew about it . He told me . He admires Lacouture . What happened to the dance music ? Ach , look at the time . How did it get to be half past one ? There 's a little supper on , gentlemen , nothing elaborate  --  " He rose , puffing on the cigar . " The American Jews will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the United States . Lacouture is their friend , if they 'll only listen to him . You know what the Fuhrer said in his January speech  --  if they start another world war , that will be the end of them . He was in deadly earnest , I assure you . " Aware that he was butting a stone wall , but unable to let these things pass , Pug said , " Peace or war is n't up to the Jews . And you grossly misunderstandLacouture . " " Do I ? But my dear Captain , what do you call the British guarantee to Poland ? Politically and strategically it was frivolous , if not insane . All it did was bring in two big powers against Germany on the trivial issue of Danzig , which was what the Jews wanted . Churchill is a notorious Zionist . All this was clearly stated between the lines in Lacouture 's last speech . I tell you , men like him may still manage to restore the peace and incidentally to save the Jews from a very bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  how about an omelette and a glass of champagne ? " Or , Christmas Eve , Victor Henry left the embassy early to walk home . The weather was threatening , but he wanted air and exercise . Berlin was having a lugubrious Yuletide . The scrawny newspapers had no good war news , and the Russian attack on Finland was bringing little joy to Germans . The shop windows offered colorful cornucopias of appliances , clothing , toys , wines , and food , but people hurried sullenly along the cold windy streets under dark skies , hardly glancing at the mockingdisplays . None of the stuff was actually for sale . As Pug walked , eveningfell and the blackout began . Hearing muffled Christmas songs from behind curtained windows , he could picture the Berliners sitting in dimly lit apartments in their overcoats around tinsel-draped fir trees , trying to make merry on watery beer , potatoes , and salt mackerel . At Abendruh , the Henrys had almost forgotten that there was a war on , if a dormant one , and that serious shortages existed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rhoda 's urging , he had accepted an invitation to come back to Abendruh in January , though he had not enjoyed himself there . More and more , especially since his glimpse of the National Socialist leaders at Karinhall , he thought of the Germans as people he would one day have to fight . He felt hypocritical putting on the good fellow with them . But intelligence opportunities did exist at Stoller 's estate . Pug had sent home a five-page account just of his talk with General von Roon . By pretending he agreed at heart with Ike Lacouture  --  something Stoller alreadybelieved , because he wanted to  --  he could increase those opportunities . It meant being a liar , expressing ideas he thought pernicious , and abusing a man 's hospitality  --  a hell of a way to serve one 's country ! But if Stoller was trying games with the American naval attach6 , he had to take the risks . Victor Henry was mulling over all this as he strode along , muffled to his eyes against a sleety rain that was starting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approached and touched his arm . " Captain Henry ? " " Who are you ? " " Rosenthal . You are living in my house . " They were near a corner , and in the glow of the blue streetlight Pug saw that the Jew had lost a lot of weight ; the skin of his face hung in folds , and his nose seemed far more prominent . He was stooped over , and his confident bearing had given way to a whipped and sickly look . It was a shocking change . Holding out his hand , Pug said , " Oh , yes . Hello . " " Forgive me . My wife and I are going to be sent to Poland soon . Or at least we have heard such a rumor and we want to prepare , in case it 's true . We ca n't take our things , and we were just wondering whether there are any articles in our home you and Mrs. Henry would care to buy . You could have anything you wished , and I could make you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stories of the " resettlement " of the Berlin Jews , a wholesale shipping-off to newly formed Polish ghettos , where conditionswere , according to the reports you chose to believe , either moderatelybad or fantastically horrible . It was disturbing to talk to a manactually menaced with this dark misty fate . " You have a factory here , " he said . " Ca n't your people keep an eye on your property until conditions get better ? " " The fact is I 've sold my firm , so there 's nobody . " Rosenthal held up the frayed lapels of his coat against the cutting sleet and wind . " Did you sell out to the Stoller bank ? " The Jew 's face showed astonishment and timorous suspicion . " Youknow about these matters ? Yes , the Stoller bank . I received a very fair  |p309|price  . Very fair . " The Jew permitted himself a single ironic glance into Henry 's eyes . " But the proceeds were tied up to settle other matters . My wife and I will be more comfortable in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So  --  perhaps the carpets  --  the plate , or some china ? " " Come along and talk it over with my wife . She makes all those decisions . Maybe you can have dinner with us . " Rosenthal sadly smiled . " I do n't think so , but you 're very kind . " Pug nodded , remembering his Gestapo-planted servants . " Herr Rosenthal , I have to repeat to you what I said when we rented your place . I do n't want to take advantage of your misfortune . " " Captain Henry , you ca n't possibly do me and my wife a greater kindness . I hope you will buy something . " Rosenthal put a card in his hand and melted into the blackout . When Pug got home Rhoda was dressing for the charge 's dinner , so there was no chance to talk about the offer . The embassy 's Christmas party had none of the opulence of an Abendruh banquet , but it was good enough . Nearly all the Americans left in Berlin were there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a meal of roast goose , pumpkin pie , fruit , cheese , and cakes , all from Denmark . Diplomatic import privileges made this possible , and the guests grew merry over the unaccustomed abundance . Victor I Ienry loved being back among American faces , American talk , offhand open manners , laughter from the diaphragm and not from the face muscles ; not a bow or a clicked pair of heels , not a woman 's European smile , gleaming on and off like an electric sign . But trouble broke out with Rhoda . He heard her raising her voice at Fred Fearing , who was sucking his corncob pipe and glaring at her far down the table . Pug called , " Hey , what 's it about , Fred ? " " The Wolf Stollers , Pug , the loveliest people your wife has ever met . " " I said the nicest Germans , " Rhoda shrilled , " and it 's quite true . You 're blindly prejudiced . " " It 's time you went home , Rhoda , " Fearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she snapped back , still much too loud . At Abendruh Rhoda had loosened up on her count of drinks , and tonight she appeared to be further along than usual . Her gestures were getting broad , she was holding her eyes half-closed , and her voice tones were going up into her nose . " Well , kid , if you think people like Wolf Stoller and his wife are nice , you 'll believe next that Hitler just wants to reunite the German folk peace/fully . About that time you need to go back for a while on American chow and the New York Times . " " I just know that Germans are not monsters with horns and tails , " said Rhoda , " but ordinary people , however misguided . Or did one of your frauleins show up in bed with cloven hoofs , dear ? " The crude jibe caused a silence . Fearing was an ugly fellow , tall , long-faced , curly-headed , with a narrow foxy nose ; upright , idealistic , full of rigid liberal ideas , and severe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human side . He had seduced the wife of his collaborator on a best seller about the Spanish Civil War . This lady he had recently parked in England with an infant daughter , and he was now  --  so the talk ran  --  making passes at every available German woman , and even some American wives . Rhoda had once half-seriously told Pug that she had had trouble with Freddy on the dance floor . All the same , Fred Fearing was a famous , able reporter . Because he detested the Nazis , he tried hard to be fair to them , and the propaganda ministry understood this . Most Americans got their picture of Nazi Germany at war from Fearing 's broadcasts . Victor Henry said , as amiably as he could , to break the silence , " It might be easier to navigate in this country , Rhoda , if the bad ones would sprout horns or grow hair in their palms or something . " " What Wolf Stoller has in his palms is blood , lots of it , " Fearing said , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . You and Rhoda encourage this slight color blindness , Pug , by acting the same way . " " It 's Pug 's job to socialize with people like Stoller , " said the charge mildly , from the head of the table . " I propose a moratorium tonight on discussing the Germans . " Colonel Forrest was rubbing his broken nose , a mannerism that signalledan itch to argue , though his moon face remained placid . He put in , nasally , " Say , Freddy , I happen to think Hitler just wants to reorganizecentral Europe as a German sphere , peacefully if he can , and that he 'll call off the war if the Allies will agree . Think I should go home , too ? " Fearing emitted a column of blue smoke and red sparks from his pipe . " What about Mein Kamp f , Bill ? " " Campaign document of a thirty-year-old hothead , " snapped the military attach6 , " written eighteen years ago in jail . Now he 's the head of state . He 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all about tearing off the southern half of Russia and making a German breadbasketof it . That 's an old Vienna coffeehouse fantasy . It went out of the window once and for all with the pact . The Jewish business is bad , but the man 's doing his job with the crude tools at hand . That unfortu/nately includes anti-Semitism . He did n't invent it . It was big on the Germanscene before he was born . " " Yes , time for you to go home , " said Fearing , gulping Moselle . " Well , what 's your version ? " Now plainly irritated , the military attacheput on an imitation of the broadcaster 's voice . " That Adolf Hitlerthe mad house painter is out to conquer the world ? " " Oh , hell , Hitler 's revolution does n't know where it 's going , Bill , any more than the French or Russian revolutions did , " exclaimed Fearing , with an exasperated wave of his corncob . " It 's just raging along the way those did and it 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he moves peacefully where he can . Why not ? Everywhere he 's pushed in there have been welcoming groups of leading citizens , or traitors , you might say . In Poland they swarmed . Why , you know that France and England have parties ready right this second to cooperate with him . He just has to strike hard enough in the west to knock out the ins and bring in the outs . He 's already got Stalin cravenly feeding him all the Russian oil and wheat he needs , in return for the few bones he threw him in the Baltic . " With swinging theatrical gestures of the smoking pipe , Fearing went on , " By 1942 , the way things are going , you may see a world in which Germany will control the industries of Europe , the raw materials of the Soviet Union , and the navies of England and France . Why , the French fleet would go over to him tomorrow if the right admiral sneezed . He 'll fiave a working deal with the Japs for exploiting Asia and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then what ? Not to mention the network of dictatorships in South America , already in the Nazis ' pocket . You know , of course , Bill , that the United States Army is now two hundred thousand strong , and that Congress intends to cut it " " Well , I 'm against that , of course , " said Colonel Forrest . " I daresay ! A new bloody dark age is threatening to engulf the whole world and Congress wants to cut down the Army ! " " An interesting vision , " smiled the charge . " Slightly melodramatic . " Rhoda Henry raised her wineglass , giggling noisily . " Lawks a mercy me ! I never heard such wild-eyed poppycock . Freddy , you 're the one who . hould go home . Merry Christmas . " Fred Fearing 's face reddened . He looked up and down the table . ' Tug Henry , I like you . I guess I 'll go for a walk . " As the broadcaster strode away from the table , the charge rose and hurried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Henrys went home early . Pug had to hold up Rhoda as they left , because she was halfasleep , and unsteady at the knees.  |p312The  next pouch of Navy mail contained an Alnav listing changes of duty for most of the new captains . They were becoming execs of battleships , commanding officers of cruisers , chiefs of staff to admirals at sea . For Victor Henry there were no orders . He stared out of the window at Hitler 's chancellery , at the black-clad SS men letting snow pile on their helmets and shoulders like statues . Suddenly , he had had enough . He toldhis yeoman not to disturb him , and wrote three letters . The first expressedregret to the Stallers that , due to unforeseen official problems , he andRhoda would not be coming back to Abendruh . The second , two formalparagraphs to the Bureau of Personnel , requested transfer to sea duty . Inthe third , a long handwritten letter to Vice-Admiral Preble , Pug pouredout his disgust with his assignment and his desire to go back to sea . Heended up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm miserable , Admiral , and maybe for that reason my wife is miserable . She 's falling apart here in Berlin . It 's a nightmarish place . This is n't the Navy 's concern , but it 's mine . If I have been of any service to the Navy in my entire career , the only recompense I now ask , and beg , is a transfer to sea duty . A few days later another White House envelope came with a scrawl in black , thick , slanting pencil . The postmark showed that it had crossed his letter . PugYour report is really grand , and gives me a helpful picture . Hitler is a strange one , is n't he ? Everybody 's reaction is a little different . I 'm delightedthat you are where you are , and I have told CNO that . He says you want to return briefly in May for a wedding . That will be arranged . Be sure to drop in on me when you can spare a moment . FDRVictor Henry bought two of Rosenthal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Rhoda particularly loved , at the prices the man named . His main motive was to cheer her up , and it worked ; she gloated over the bargains for weeks , and never tired of saying , truly enough , that the poor Jewish man 's thankfulness to her had been overwhelming . Pug also wrote the Stollers about this time that , if the invitation held , he and Rhoda would come back to Abendruh after all . If his job was intelligence , he decided , he had better get on with it ; moreover , the moral gap between him and Stoller seemed to have narrowed . Notwithstanding Rosenthal 's pathetic gratitude for the deal , his possessions were Objekte.  |p313New  Year 's Eve MidnightBriny dearI ca n't think of a better way to start 1940 than by writing to you . I 'm home , typing away in my old bedroom , which seems one-tenth as large as I remembered it . The whole house seems so cramped and cluttered , and God , how that smell of insecticide wipes away the years . Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States is ! I had forgotten , completely forgotten . When I reached New York , my father was already out of the hospital  --  I learned this by phoning home  --  so I blew two hundred of my hardearneddollars on a 1934 Dodge coupe , and I drove to Florida ! I really did . Via Washington . I wanted to see the Capitol dome and the Monument . Yes , I wanted to see Slote too . More of that later , but let me assure you that he got little comfort out of the meeting . But so help me , Briny , I mainly wanted to get the feel of the country again . Well , in dead of winter , in lousy weather , and despite the tragic Negro shantytowns that line the roads down South , the Atlantic states are beautiful , spacious , raw , clean , full of wilderness still , exploding with energy and life .

The Miami Beachers do n't believe in hiding what they 've got . I think of Warsaw , and I get angry , but it passes . They 're no different , in their obliviousness to the war , from the rest of the Americans . The doctors say my father 's coming along fine after a heart attack that all but did him in .

When I told him I 'd fallen head over ears in love with you , it literally staggered him . I mean he tottered to a chair and fell in it , pale as a ghost . Poor old Slote ! A conversation ensued that went on for hours , in a bar , in a restaurant , in my car , in half a dozen circuits on foot around the Lincoln Memorial in a freezing wind , and finally in his apartment .

It would be the greatest possiblemistake . I say this as a friend , and somebody who knows you better than anyone else . MS : I told Byron that too . I said it would be ridiculous for me to marry him , and gave him all the reasons . SLOTS : Well , then , what on earth have you in mind ? ME : I 'm just reporting a fact to you . I have n't anything in mind . SLOTH : You had better snap out of it . You 're an intellectual and a grown woman .

( Yawn ) And I must go to sleep now . I want to drive four hundred miles tomorrow . ( Exit Jastrow , at long last . ) All things considered , he took it well . He calmly says we 're getting married once I 'm over this nuttiness , and he 's going ahead with his plans for it .

I 'm still overwhelmed , I still love you , I still long for you . Separated though we are , I 've never been so happy in all my life . If only you were here right this minute ! I said you see things too simply , but on one point you were just plain right . Aaron should leave that stupid house , let it fall down and rot , and come back to this wonderful land to live out his days . His move there was stupid . His remaining there is imbecilic .

All his inconsequencewas in the trailed-off , crushed " ... yron . " Poor Briny ! Yet Natalie found herself dwelling on the artless empty scribblings as though they were letters of George Bernard Shaw . She kept them under her pillow . They contrasted most cruelly with her other preoccupation , for to pass the time she had hauled out her master 's thesis , already threequarterswritten in French : " Contrasts in the Sociologismic Critique of War : Durkheim 's Writings on Germany , 1915-1916 , and Tolstoy 's Second Epilogue to War and Peace , 1869 . " She was giving thought to translatingit , and enrolling in Columbia or NYLI in the fall to finish it off and get her degree . It was a good thesis . Even Slote had read sections with approval , if now and again with a thin Oxonian smile . She wanted not only to finish , but to revise it . She had started with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wars . Her experiences in Poland had inclined her to agree much more with Durkheimabout Germany . These things were as far beyond the writer of the letters under her pillow as the general theory of relativity . It would give Briny a headache just to read her title . But she did n't care . She was in love . Popular songs were sweetly stabbing her : songs about women infatuatedwith worthless men , whining cowboy laments about absent sweethearts . It was as though she had developed a craving for penny candy . She was ashamed of gratifying her fancy , but she could n't get enough of these songs . She bought records and played them over and over . If Byron Henry wrote stupid letters , too bad . All judgments fell away before her remembrance of his eyes and his mouth and his arms , her delight at contemplating a few ill-written sentences because they came from his hand . A much better letter came along : the answer to her first long one from Miami Beach , several pages typed with Byron 's odd offhand clarity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rattling , and his pages looked like a stenographer 's work . Natalie darling : Well , that 's more like it . A real letter . God , I waited a long time . I skipped all that stuff about the USA and Miami , to get to the Slote business , but then I went back and read it all . Nobody has to tell me how good the United States is , compared to Europe . I 'm so homesick at this point , I could die . This is quite aside from my yearning for you , which remains as strong as if you were in the room downstairs . I 'm beginning top317understand how iron filings must feel around a magnet . Sometimes , sitting in my room thinking about you , the pull gets so strong , I have the feeling if I let go of the arms of my chair I 'd float out of the window and across France and over the Atlantic , straight to your house at 1316 Normandie Drive . Natalie was enchanted with this imaginative little conceit , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's going to marry you . He had his chance . By the way , I 'm more than one-third through Slote 's list of tomes about the Germans . Some of them are n't available in English , but I 'm slogging along with what I can get . There 's not much else to do here . The one reward of my isolation in this godforsaken town is the one-man seminar that A.J. is conducting with me . His view is more or less like Slote 's , and I 'm getting the picture . The Germans have been the comers in Europe ever since Napoleon , because of their geographical place , their numbers , and their energy , but they 're a strange dark people . All of these writers Slote listed eventually come out with the pedantic destructiveness , the scary sureness that they 're right , that the Germans have been gypped for centuries , that the world 's got to be made over on their terms . What it boils down to so far for me is that Hitler is , after all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're there ; that the Germans ca n't be allowed to rule Europe because they have some kind of mass mental distortion , despite their brilliance , and ca n't even rule themselves ; and that when they try for mastery , somebody 's got to beat the living daylightsout of them or you 'll have barbarism triumphant . A.J. adds his own notion about the " good Germany " of progressive liberals and the " bad Germany " of Slote 's romantics and nationalists , all tied in with geographicallocation and the Catholic religion , which sort of loses me . ( Wonder if any of this will get past the censors ? I bet it will . The Italians fear and loathe the Germans . There 's a word that passes around here about Mussolini . They say he 's the monkey that opened the tiger 's cage . Pretty good . ) Getting A.J. out of here seems to be a bit of a project , after all . There was a minor technical foul-up in his naturalization , way , way back . I do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The new consul general in Rome is a sort of prissy bureaucrat , and he 's creatingdifficulties . All this will straighten out , of course  --  they 've said as much in Rome  --  but it 's taking time . So I wo n't abandon A.J. now . But even if your plans are n't clear by mid-April , I must come home then and I will , whether A.J. does or not . Aside from my brother 's wedding , my father 's on fire to get me into submarineschool , where the next officer course starts May 27 . The course lasts six months , and then there 's a year of training in subs operating around Connecticut . So even in the unlikely event that I do enroll  --  I 'll only do it if the war breaks wide open  --  we could be together a lot . Siena 's gotten real dumpy . The hills are brown , the vines are cut to black stumps . The people creep around the streets looking depressed . The Palio 's off for 1940 . It 's cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house , anyway , the trees are still blooming , and A.J. and I still have our coffee there . I smell the blossoms and I think of you . I often go in there just to take a few breaths , and I close my eyes and there you are , for a moment . Natalie , there has to be a God or I would n't have found you , and He has to be the same God for both of us . There 's only one God . I love you . Briny " Well , well , " Natalie said aloud , as tears sprang from her eyes and dropped on the flimsy airmail paper . " You miserable chestnut-haired devil . " She kissed the pages , smearing them orange-red . Then she looked at the date again : February io , and this was April 9  --  almost two months for an airmail letter ! There was no point in answering , at that rate . He might be on his way back now . But she seized a pad and began writing . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the radio in the garden . They had just eaten lunch and her mother had gone off to a committee meeting . As Natalie poured loving words on paper , a news broadcast came driftingin on the warm air through the open window . The announcer , with rich dramatic doom in his voice , spoke words that arrested her pen : " The phony war ' has ended . A fierce air , sea , and land battle is ragingfor Norway . NBC brings special bulletins from the war capitals that tell the story . " London . In a lightning attack , without warning or provocation , Nazi Germany has invaded neutral Norway by sea and air , and German land forces have rolled into Denmark . Fierce resistance is reported by the Norwegian government at Oslo , Narvik , Trondheim , and other key points along the coast , but German reinforcements are continuing to pour in . The Royal Navy is moving rapidly to cut off the invasion . Winston Churchill , First Lord of the Admiralty , declared this morning , All German vessels entering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pad and pen , Natalie went to the window . Her father , sitting with his back to her in blazing sunshine , his bald , sunburned head with its gray fringe tilted to one side , was listening with motionless intensity to this shattering development . " Paris . In an official communique , the French government announced that the Allies would rally to the cause of democratic Norway ,  |p319and  would meet the German onslaught quote with cold steel unquote . Pessimistic commentators pointed out that the fall of Norway and Denmarkwould put more than a thousand additional miles of European coastlinein German hands and that this would mean the collapse of the British blockade . " Berlin . The propaganda ministry has issued the following bulletin . Forestalling a British plan to seize Scandinavia and deny Germany accessto Swedish iron ore and other raw materials , the German armed forces have peaceably taken Denmark under their protection and have arrived in Norway by sea and air , where the populace has enthusiastically welcomed them . Oslo is already in German hands , and the life of the capital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been crushed . The Fuhrer has sent the following message of congratulationto .. . " Natalie came out into the garden to talk to her father about the shockingnews , and was surprised to find him sleeping through it , his head dropped on his chest . The radio was blaring ; and her father usually hung on the news broadcasts . The shadow from his white linen cap obscured his face , but she could see a queer expression around his mouth . His upper teeth were protruding ludicrously over his lip . Natalie came to him , and touched his shoulder . " Pa ? " He did not respond . He felt inert . She could see now that his upper plate had worked loose . " Pal " As she shook him his head lolled and the cap fell off . She thrust her hand inside his loose flowered sport shirt ; there was no heartbeat under the warm clammy skin . In the instant before she shrieked and ran inside to telephone the doctor , she saw on her dead father 's face a strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never observed . She walked through the next weeks in a fog of shocked grief . Nataliehad stopped taking her father seriously at about the age of twelve ; he was just a businessman , a sweater manufacturer , a temple president , and she was then already a brash intellectual snob . Since then she had become more and more aware of how her father 's sense of inferiority to Aaron Jastrow , and to his own daughter , permeated his life . Yet she was prostrated when he died . She could not eat . Even with drugs she could not sleep . Her mother , a conventional woman usually preoccupied with ladassah meetings and charity fund-raising , for many years completely baffled by her daughter , pulled out of her own grief and tried in vain to comfort her . Natalie lay in her room on her bed , wailing and bawling , almost constantly at first , and in spells every day for weeks afterward . She suffered agonies of guilt for neglecting and despising her father . He had loved her and spoiled her . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sorbonne for two years , that had been that . She had never even asked whether he could afford it . She had felled him with her bizarre misadventuresand had experienced no remorse while he was alive . Now he was gone , and she was on her own , and it was too late . He was unreachable by love or regret . The radio news  --  disaster on disaster in Norway , German drives succeeding , Allied landings failing , the remnants of the Norwegian army retreating into the mountains where the Germans were hunting them down  --  came to her as dim distant rumors . Reality was only her wet pillow , and the stream of middle-aged sunburned Jews paying condolence calls , and all the endless talk about money problems . She was shocked back into her senses by two events , one on top of the other ; Byron 's return from Europe , and the German attack on France.  | ( from WORLD EMPIRE LOST ) The Great AssaultModern war is characterized by sudden swift changes on the grand scale . In the spring of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to upsetthe world order . On May 10 , the English and French were still the victors of Versailles , still masters of the seas and continents . By May 17 France was a beaten , almost helpless nation , and England was hanging on for her life . On paper , the odds had been heavy against Fall Gelb ( " Case Yellow " ) , our plan for attacking France . The figures of the opposing forces had certainly comforted the enemy and disturbed us . But put to the test , Case Yellow ( revised ) brought a big victory . Our soldiers man for man proved superior to the best the democracies had . Our High Command used well the lessons of massed armor and gasoline-engine mobility learned in the defeat of World War I at the hands of British tank battalions . The Anglo-French world hegemony stood unmasked as a mere historical husk . It still commanded the seas and the access to raw materials ; its resources for a long war were superior to ours ; but without the will to use them these advantages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In judging Hitler , historians must recognize that he sensed this weakness of the other side , and that we of the General Staff erred . We assumed that our professional opponents were preparing with due urgency to wage war . But in fact their countrymen would not face realities , and their politicians would not tell the people unpleasant truths . Adolf Hitler gambled the future of Germany , and therefore of Europe , and therefore of the existing world order , on one heavy armed thrust . It succeeded beyond anybody 's expectation , including his own . Besides ordering the attack over the pessimistic objections of our staff , Hitler also , almost at the last minute , adopted the bold Manstein Plan for an armored strike in force through the bad Ardennes terrain , to turn the left flank of the Maginot Line . This departure from the classic Schlieffen Plan achieved total surprise , and led to Rundstedt 's magnificent race across northern France to the sea . It split the Allies , sent the British fleeing across the Channel in an improvised flotilla of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ended the shaky French will to fight . Thereafter we marched south to Paris against fastcrumblingresistance . And so Germany achieved in a few weeks , under a former corporal , what it had failed to do in four years of desperate combat under Kaiser Wilhelm II . The technical key to our victory in France was simply that we massed our armor into whole spearhead divisions , like iron cavalry , thus restoring speed and movement to the battlefields of the industrial age , supposedly paralyzed forever into trench warfare by the strength and range of mechanical firepower . We learned this from the works of the English tactician Fuller and the French tactician de Gaulle , analyzing the lessons of World War I.The French army , with armored strength superior to our own , ignored these Allied thinkers , and scattered thousands of tanks piecemeal among the infantry divisions . This question of how to use the new self-propelled armor had been much disputed between the wars . We took the right path of Fuller , de Gaulle , and our own Guderian . Our opponents took the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground tactics hastened the victory . The Maginot LineThe world was stunned . For months Western newspapers and magazines had been printing maps of Europe , showing imaginary battle lines for the comingcampaign . The French commander-in-chief , Generalissimo Maurice Gamelin , " the world 's foremost professional soldier , " as the Western journalists called him , was supposed to have a masterly plan to beat us . In modern war , according to this rumored " Gamelin Plan , " industrial firepowergave the defense an advantage over the offense of ten or fifteen to one . France had spent one and a half million soldiers ' lives in World War I proving that the massed infantry attacks of Napoleon no longer worked against machine guns and cannon . There would be no more Verduns . The new concept was to build in peacetime a great wall of linked fortresses with the strongest modern firepower . No matter how many millions of men a future enemy might hurl against this wall , they would all drown in their own blood . On this theory , France had constructed a chain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If we Germans did not attack , then between the land wall of the Maginot Line and the British sea blockade , the economiclife would be choked out of us . Finally the Allied armies would sally forthp323from the Line to deliver the coup de grace , if revolution did not topple Hitler first , and bring our generals crawling for peace terms , as we had in 1918 . So ran the newspaper talk in the West during the sitzkrieg . Informed military men had a question or two about this Maginot Line . It was indeed a marvel of engineering , but was it not too short ? Beginning at the Swiss Alps , it ran along the French-German border for more than a hundred miles to a place called Longuyon . There it stopped . Between Longuyon and the English Channel , there still remained a hole of open level country , the boundary between France and Belgium , at least as long as the Line itself . In 1914 , we bestial Germans had attacked through Belgium precisely because this hole offeredsuch a flat fine road to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maginot Line and come down by that route again ? The proponents of the Gamelin Plan met such questions with ironic smiles . Yes , to run the Line straight through Belgium to the sea would have been very fine , they said . But that was up to the Belgians , who insisted on preserving their neutrality instead . As for completing the Line in French territory , it would have had to cut through a hundred thirty miles of important industrial areas . Moreover , at the time when it might have been done , a mood of economy had come over the government . The people wanted shorter hours and higher pay . The cost would have been astronomical . Also , subsurface water in the area made a tunnel system difficult . Also , by then Hitler was in power , and extending the tine might have provoked the bellicose Fuhrer to do something rash . In short , the wisest military brains in France had decided not to finish the Maginot Line . Instead , there was the Gamelin Plan . If war came , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Belgian border . If the Germans did try to come through there again , the Allies under Gamelin would leap forward and join the tough Belgian army of two hundred thousand men4j on a strong river line . Given the enormous advantage of the defense in modern warfare , a German attack on such a narrow front would bloodily collapse . Outcome of the PlanWe did attack , though not exactly where the Plan called for us to do so . Flve days later , Generalissimo Gamelin was fired . We were pouring around the north end of the Maginot Line through the supposedly " impassable " Ardennescountry , and flooding westward across France . Thus we cut off the French and British armies which , following the Gamelin Plan , had duly leaped forward into Belgium . Our Eighteenth Army under Kuchler was also coming at them from Holland to the north . They were trapped . On the morning of May 15 , the prime minister of France telephoned his defense minister to ask what countermeasuresGamelin was proposing . The minister answered , according to history , " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paris next day at the Quai d'Orsay , Winston Churchill , who had desperately flown over from London , asked Generalissimo Gamelin , " General , where is the reserve  --  the masse de manoeuvre  --  to bring up against the German breakthroughT ' The world 's foremost professional soldier replied , according to Churchill 's memoirs , " Aucune . " ( There is n't any . ) General Weygand relieved him . We took the Maginot Line from behind with no trouble , since the guns pointed the other way ; marched off to captivity the French armies found sitting inside the forts and tunnels ; transferred all the cannon to the English Channel for use against the British ; took all the stored food and equipment in the labyrinth ; and left a few light bulbs to illuminate the empty concrete passageways . So the Maginot Line remains to this day . The French passed from the stage of historical greatness . Germany 's implacableenemy of the centuries had at last come to grief . Strategically , they had guessed wrong on the use of industrial power in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on an enormous tragic joke in steel and concrete : half a wall . Tactically , when General Gamelin said , " Aucune , " the military history of France was over . Shadows on the VictoryIn the headquarters of the Supreme Command , the victory over France , while welcome and exhilarating , had its worrisome aspects . Some of us who were present at the signing of the armistice watched with heavy hearts as the FUhrer danced his little jig of triumph in the sunshine of Compiegne . We were torn between pride in this feat of German arms , this virile reversal of the 1918 defeat , and our inside knowledge of tragic errors the capering Dictator had made or tried to make . These were completely covered up for the world at large by the rosy glow of success . Germany in that hour was like a virgin at a military ball , all radiant with the blushes aroused in her by the admiring eyes of handsomeofficers , and all unaware of a fatal cancer budding inside her . The cancer already afflicting Germany at that hour , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of command , was amateur military leadership . We had watched the symptoms crop up in the minor Norway operation . Our hope was that our inexperienced warlord , having been blooded in that victory , would steady down for the great assault in the west . But , six days after the breakthrough , when Rundstedt was rolling to the sea , with Guderian 's panzers in the van and all enemy forces in flight , Hitler had a bad fit of nerves , fearing a French counterattack from the south  --  no more likely at that moment than a Hottentot counterattack  --  and halted Rundstedt 's army group for two precious days . Fortunately Guclerian wangled permissionp325for a " reconnaissance in force " westward . Thereupon he simply ignored the Fuhrer and blitzed ahead to the coast . Then followed an incredible tactical blunder . With the British expeditionary force helplessly retreating toward the sea , but far behind in the race and about to be cut off by Guderian 's massed tanks , the Fuhrer halted Guderian on the River Aa , nine miles from Dunkirk , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this day nobody has factually ascertained why he did this . Theoriesare almost as abundant as military historians , but they add little to the facts . During these three days the British rescued their armies from the Dunkirk beaches . That is the long and short of the " miracle of Dunkirk . " Had Hitler not halted Guderian , the panzers would have beaten the foe to Dunkirk and cut him off . The British would have lost over three hundred thousand men and officers , the bulk of their trained land force , in the Flanders cauldron . I discuss in detail , under my section " Fantastic Halt at the River Aa , " the preposterousness of the excuse that the terrain around Dunkirk was too marshy , and too crisscrossed by hedges and canals , for tank operations . The fact is that finally Guderian did advance , after seventy-two mortal hours in which the first golden chance for quick victory in World War II slipped from our grasp . Hermann Goring 's Luftwaffe was suppoed to take over from the halted armored divisions and finish off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Nazi air marshal in at the kill , instead of the distrusted Army General Staff . History records what Goring accomplished . But if final victory was denied us , at least we had vanquished France ; that much seemed indisputable . Yet on June 6 even this was momentarily cast in doubt when Hitler had another brainstorm . Paris , he suddenly declared , was not the objective ; what our armies should do next was cut southeast in force and capturethe Lorraine basin , so as to deny France its coal and armaments industriesl Fortunately the momentum of operations was beyond even the Fuhrer 's power to meddle . We took Paris even while a number of divisions went wheeling needlesslyinto Lorraine . His Worst MistakeBut worse than all these mistakes  --  so bad that history will forever stand amazed at the fact  --  the Wehrmacht arrived at the English Channel without any plan of what to do nextl There we were at the sea , millions strong , armed to the teeth , flushed with victory , facing a beaten , disarmed , impotent enemy across a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had all staff activities so firmly in his grip that nobody could make a move without his nod , had somehow overlooked the slight detail of how one got to England . Here nevertheless was a moment for greatness , such as comes once in a thousand years . Alexander , Caesar , and Napoleon in their time had made mis- takes as major as any of Hitler 's . What they possessed to balance and outweigh these was generalship : the ability to divine and seize a favoring moment with the utmost speed and audacity . Yes , we had no plan for invading England , but had the British had a plan for crossing the Channel from Dunkirk in a scrapedtogetherflotilla of cockleshells$ Under the spur of necessity , despite the total disorganization of defeat , despite fierce Luftwaffe bombardment , they had moved three hundred thousand men across the water . Why then could not we , the strongest armed force on earth in the full tide of victory , do a " Dunkirk in reverse , " and throw a force of armored divisions across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing on the ground in England to opposeour march to London . The rescued expeditionary force was a disarmed rabble ; all its equipment lay abandoned in Randers . The Home Guard was a pathetic raggle-taggle of old men and boys . Opposing our invasion would have been the Royal Air Force and the Britishfleet , two formidable fighting organizations . But had Hitler seized the first moment in June , using every available vessel afloat in western and northern Europe  --  there were thousands  --  to hurl an invasion body across the Channel , the fleet would have been caught by surprise , as it had been in the Norway operation . We would have been across before it could mass to counterattack . The aerial Battle of Britain would have been fought out in the skies over the Channel , under conditions vastly more favorable to the Luftwaffe . Assuredly we would have taken very heavy losses . The attack phase and the supply problem would have cost dearly . Again we would have been staking all on one throw . But in the hindsight of history , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requested in writing , from American and German archivists , a copy of a draft memorandum I wrote in June 1940 , outlining for headquarters discussion a plan for exactly such an immediate cross-Channel assault . My requestshave gone unanswered . The memorandum is only a curiosity , and I have no way of knowing whether it has actually survived . At the time Jodi returned it to me without a single word , and that was the end of it . The Aborted InvasionSeelowe ( Sea lion ) , the invasion scheme scrambled together in the ensuing months , proved an exercise in leisurely futility . Forcing the Channel , once the British had caught their breath and fortified their coast , needed a complex buildup . Hitler never really pushed it . Against England he had lacked the greatnessto dare all ; and we gradually saw that he lacked the stomach to dare much . He merely allowed Goring to waste his Luftwaffe over the British aerodromes far inland , while the army and the navy frittered away weeks that stretched through the summer , disputing over the operation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the end , " Sea Lion " was abandoned . Germany certainly hadp327the industrial plant and the military strength to mount the invasion , but not the leadership . When an ounce more of boldness in battle might have won a world , Hitler faltered ; and the professional generals were all in impotent subjection to this amateur . That was the real " triumph " of the Fiihrerprinzip in the summer of 1940 . In retrospect , the wrong leader danced the jig . TRANSLATOR 'S NOTE : Roon 's biting discussion of the Maginot Line and the French leadership leaves little more to be said . My friends in the Royal Navy stoutly deny that even in June the Germans could have made it across the Channel . They would have thrown in every last ship they had , of course , to drown the invaders . It is a moot point , but in my judgment Roon makes out a fair case . The U-boats , which he does not mention , would have wreaked havoc in the narrow Channel against a defensively positionedfleet . Roon is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staff plans for an invasion . Had they had a feasible one ready , he might have activatedit , as he did the Manstein Plan . Apparently , there was in the files a sketchy naval staff study , and nothing more . The German General Staff in World War II had a strange tendency not to see beyond the next hill , or maybe they preferred not to look .  --  V.H.p328PassiNG a newsstand on the corner of Fifth Avenue and Fifty-seventh Street , where a fresh stack of afternoon papers fluttered under a cobblestone , Janice Lacouture said to Madeline , " Oh gawd , there 's Daddy again , sounding off . Wo n't your folks be impressed ! " Madeline was helping her shop for her trousseau . Rhoda , Pug , and Byron were due at three o'clock in the Brooklyn Navy Yard , aboard the cruiser Helena . Janice 's first encounter with Warren 's mother was much on her mind , far more so than the bad war news . A rough May wind swooped along the avenue , whipping the girls ' skirts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and her hat with the other , peering at the two-column photograph of Congressman Isaac Lacouture on the Capitol steps , with three microphones thrust in his face . " He 's handsome , you know , " she said . " I hope you 'll like him . He 's really an awfully smart man , " Janice said , pitching her voice above the wind . " Actually the reporters have pushed him further than he ever intended to ga . Now he 's way out on a limb . " Madeline had redecorated the little flat . The walls were pale green , with cream-and-green flowered draperies . New Danish teak furniture , austere and slight , made the place seem roomier . Jonquils and irises in a bowl on the dining table touched the place with spring and youth , much as the two girls did when they walked in . It was not a flat where one expected to find a Communist boyfriend . Indeed Madeline had long since discarded the poor popeyed trombone player in brown  --  something Janice had been relieved to learn . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man and very bright , but going bald at twenty-six.  |p329She  called her telephone answering service , briskly jotted notes on a pad , and slammed the receiver down . " Rats . I ca n't go with you to meet my folks , Janice , after all . Is n't that a pain ? Two of the amateurs have loused out . I have to spend the afternoon listening to replacements . Always something ! " She was clearly quite pleased with herself at being kept so hiisy . " Now . Do you happen to know a man named Palmer Kirby ? He 's at the Waldorf and he says he 's a friend of the family . " Janice shook her Bead . Madeline rang him and liked his voice with his first words ; it had a warm humorous resonance . " You are Rhoda Henry 's daughter ? I saw your name in the book and took a chance . " " Yes , I am . " " Good . Your family was very hospitable to me in Berlin . Your mother wrote me they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be tired and at a loose end , their first evening in New York . I 'd like to take all of you to dinner . " " That 's kind of you , but I do n't know their plans . They wo n't arrive till one or so . " " I see . Well , suppose I make the dinner reservations ? If your folks can come , I 'll expect you all in my suite at six or so . If not , just give me a ring , or your mother can . " " I guess so , sure . Thank you . Warren 's fianc6e is visiting me , Mr. Kirby . " " Ike Lacouture 's daughter ? Excellent . By all means bring her . " Off Madeline went , brimming with zest for existence , while Janice changed into warmer clothes for the Navy Yard . Madeline was now the " program coordinator " of The Walter Field Amateur Hour . Walter Field , an old ham actor , had stumbled into great radio popularity with the hackneyed vaudeville formula of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a whirl of big real estate deals , and just as suddenly dropped dead . Hugh Cleveland had stepped in as master of ceremonies . Madeline still fetched chicken sandwichesand coffee for him , but she now also interviewed the amateurs . She remained Cleveland 's assistant for his morning show , and she was making more money than ever . For Madeline Henry , May r940 was as jolly a month as she had ever lived . In the Brooklyn Navy Yard the wind was stronger and colder . The cruiser was already tied up at the pier , fluttering a rainbow of signal flags strung down from the mast to stern and stern . Amid a swarm of waving , shouting relatives on the pier , war refugees were streaming off the gang- way . Janice found her way to the customs shed , where Rhoda stood by a heap of luggage , blowing her nose . The tall young blonde in a green wool suit and toque caught Rhoda 's eye . " Well , is n't this Janice ? I 'm Rhoda Henry , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you justice at ALL . " " Oh , yes , Mrs. Henry ! Hello ! " Rhoda 's willowy figure , modish straw hat , and fuchsia gloves and shoes surprised Janice . Warren 's father had struck Janice , during their brief meeting in Pensacola , as a coarse-grained weather-beaten man . By contrast Mrs. Henry seemed youthful , elegant , even sexy . This was true despite the woman 's reddened nose and frequent sneezing . " Are n't YOU CLEVER to wear that suit . I dressed for spring and it 's positively ARCTIC here , " Rhoda said . " Where 's Madeline ? Is she all right ? " Quickly Janice explained why the daughter had n't come . " Well ! Has n't Mad turned into the little career girl ! My dear , I want to kiss you , but I dare n't . Do n't come near me . I 'm virulent ! I 've got the cold of the ages . They should quarantine me . I 'll infect the nation . Well ! How beautiful you are . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any-way ? " " All right , I hope . He 's sweating out carrier landings , down off Puerto Rico somewhere . " Victor Henry , looking more impressive than Janice remembered in a gold-buttoned blue bridge coat and gold-encrusted cap , came through the crowd with a surly-looking customs inspector . After a brusque greeting to Janice and an inquiry about Madeline , he wanted to know where Byron had gotten off to . " Briny disappeared . He had to make a phone call , " the mother said . As the inspector glanced through the luggage , Janice told the Henrys about Palmer Kirby 's invitation . Between sneezes , Rhoda said , " Well , of all things . His factory 's in Denver . What 's he doing here ? I do n't think we can go , can we , Pug ? Of course dinner at the Waldorf would be a lovely way to start life in the USA again . Take the taste of Berlin out of our mouths ! Janice , you just ca n't picture what Germany is like now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw the Statue of Liberty I laughed and cried . Me for the USA hereafter , now and forever . " " Matter of fact , I have to talk to Fred Kirby , " Pug said . " Oh , Pug , it 's impossible , I have his filthy cold  --  and my HmR ! " Rhoda said . " What could I wear to the Waldorf , anyhow ? Everything 's a mass of wrinkles , except what I 'm standing up in . If I could only get my pink suit pressed  --  and if I could get to a hairdresser for a couple of hours  --  " Byron came sauntering through the noisy crowd . " Hey , Janice ! I'mp331Warren 's brother . I thought you 'd be here . " He produced from his pocket a small box with a London label , and gave it to her . Janice opened it , and there lay a Victorian pin , a little golden elephantwith red stones for eyes . " Good heavens ! " " Anybody who marries one of us needs the patience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gods , if that 's not the truth , " said Rhoda , laughing . Janice gave Byron a slow female blink . He was even handsomer than Warren , she thought . His eyes had an eager aroused sparkle . She kissed him . I have nothing to offer , " said the grainy strong singsong voice out of the radio , slurring the consonants almost like a drunken man , " but blood , toil , tears , and sweat . " " Why , he 's a genius ! " Rhoda exclaimed . She sat on the edge of a frail gilt chair in Kirby 's suite , champagne glass in hand , tears in her eyes . " Where has he been till now ? " Smearing caviar from a blue Russian-printed tin on a bit of toast , and carefully sprinkling onion shreds , Byron said , " He was running the British Navy when Prien got into Scapa Flow and sank the Royal Oak . And when the Germans crossed the Skagerrak to Norway . " " Shut up and listen , " Victor Henry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , crossed her long legs , and sipped champagne . Palmer Kirby 's eyes flickered appreciatively at her legs , which pleased her . He was an interesting-looking old dog . " . . . You ask , what is our policy ? I will say , it is to wage - war , by sea , land , and air , with all our might and all the strength that God can give us : to wage war against a monstrous tyranny , never surpassed in the dark , lamentable catalogue of human crime . That is our policy . You ask , what Is our aim ? I can answer in one word : Victory  --  victory at all cost , victory in spite of all terror . . . I take up my task with buoyancy and hope . I feel lure that our cause will not be suffered to fail among men .. IThe speech ended . An American voice said with a cough and tremor , " You have just heard the newly appointed Prime Minister of Great Britain , Winston Churchill . " After a moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We 're going to get in now . The Germans overplayed their hand . We 'll never let them conquer England . There 's something strangely thick about the Germans , you know ? One must observe them close up for a long time to understand that . Strangely thick . "  |p332Victor  Henry said to Dr. Kirby , glancing at his watch , " Quite a speech . Can we talk now for a few minutes ? " Kirby got to his feet and Rhoda smiled at him . " Champagne , caviar , and business as usual . That 's Pug . " ' We 're just waiting for Madeline , " Pug said . " Come along , " Kirby said , walking into the bedroom . " Say , Dad , I 'm going to have to mosey along , " Byron said . " There 's this plane to Miami I have to catch . It leaves La Guardia in about an hour . " " What ! Dr. Kirby thinks you 're dining with him . " ' Well , see , I made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You 're not waiting till Madeline comes ? You have n't seen her in two years . She 's taking us all to her show after dinner . " " I think I 'd better go , Dad . " Abruptly , Pug left the room . " Briny , you 're impossible , " his mother said . " Could n't you have waited until tomorrow ? " " Mom , do you remember what it 's like to be in love ? " Rhoda surprised him and Janice Lacouture by turning blood red . " Me ? My goodness , Byron , what a thing to say ! Of course not , I 'm a millionyears old . " " Thank you for my marvellous pin . " Janice touched the elephant on her shoulder . " That must be some girl , in Miami . " Byron 's blank narrow-eyed look dissolved in a charming smile and an admiring glance at her . " She 's all right . " " Bring her to the wedding with you . Do n't forget . " As Byron went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a real talent for disappointing your father . " " He 'd be disappointed if I did n't disappoint him . Good-bye , Mom . " In the bedroom Dr. Kirby sat at a desk , checking off a stack of journalsand mimeographed reports that Victor Henry had brought him from Germany . As he scribbled in a yellow notebook , the little desk shook and two reports slid to the floor . " They must rent this suite to midgets , " he said , continuing to write . Victor Henry said , " Fred , are you working on a uranium bomb ? " Kirby 's hand paused . He turned , hanging one long loose arm over the back of his chair , and looked into Henry 's eyes . The silence and the steady look between the men lasted a long time . " You can just tell me it 's none of my goddamn business , but "  --  Pug sat on the bed  --  " all that stuff there zeroes in on the uranium business . And some of the things I could n't get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me flatly that they were classified because of the secret bomb aspects . The Germans are fond of talking very loosely about this terrible ultra-bomb they 're developing . That made me think there was nothing much to it . But that list of requests you sent gave me second thoughts . " Kirby knocked out his pipe , stuffed it , and lit it . The process took a couple of minutes , during which he did n't talk , but looked at Captain Henry . He said slowly , " I 'm not a chemist , and this uranium thing is more or less a chemical engineering problem . Electricity does come into it for production techniques . A couple of months ago I was approached to be an industrial consultant . " " What 's the status of the thing ? " " All theory . Years away from any serious effort . " " Do you mind telling me about it ? " " Why not ? It 's in the college physics books . Hell , it 's been in Time magazine . There 's this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and another to the emanations of radium , and see what happens . It 's been going on for years , in Europe and here . Well , t here two Germans tried it on uranium oxide last year , and they produced barium . Now that 's transmutation of elements by atom-splitting . I guess you know about the fantastic charge of energy packed in the mass of the atom . You 've heard about driving a steamship across the ocean on one lump of coal , if you could only harness the atomic energy in it , and so forth . " Victor Henry nodded . " Well , Pug , this was a hint that it might really be done with uranium . It was an atom-splitting process that put out far more energy than they 'd used to cause it . These Germans discovered that by weighing the masses involved . There 'd been an appreciable loss of mass . They published their finding , and the whole scientific community 's been in an uproar ever since . " Okay , the next step is , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This substance may turn out to have gigantic explosive powers , through a chain reaction that gives you a huge release of energy from mass . A handfulmaybe can blow up a city , that sort of talk . The nuclear boys say it may be practicable right now , if industry will just come up with enough pure U-235 . " Pug listened to all this with his mouth compressed , his body tensed forward . " Uh-huh , uh-huh , " he kept saying when Kirby puffed on his pipe . He pointed a stiff finger at the engineer . " Well , I follow all that . I " his is vital military intelligence . " Kirby shook his head . " Hardly . It 's public knowledge . It may be a complete false alarm . These chemical engineers do n't guarantee anything . And what they want will take one hell of a big industrial effort to deliver.  | Maybe the stuff will explode , maybe it wo n't . Maybe as soon as you have enough of it , it 'll all fly apart . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you 're talking about an expenditure of many many millionsof dollars . It could run up to a billion and then you could end up with a crock of horseshit . Congress is on an economy rampage . They 've been refusing Roosevelt the money for a couple of hundred new air-planes . " " I 'll ask you a couple of more questions . If I 'm off base , tell me . " " Shoot . " ' Where do you come into it ? " Kirby rubbed his pipe against his chin . " Okay , how do you separate out isotopes of a very rare metal in industrial quantities ? One notion is to shoot it in the form of an ionized gas through a magnetic field . The lighter ions get deflected a tiny bit more , so you stream ' em out and catch them . The whole game depends on the magnetic field being kept stable , because any wavering jumbles up the ion stream . Precise control of voltages is my business . " " Uh-huh . Now . One last point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinion to the President that he should get off his ass about uranium ? " Kirby uttered a short baritone laugh . " The real question here is the Germans . How far along are they ? This cuteness of theirs about pure graphite disturbs me . Graphite comes into the picture at a late stage . If Hitler gets uranium bombs first , Pug , and if they happen to work , that could prove disagreeable . " A doorbell rang . " I guess that 's your daughter , " Kirby said . " Let 's go down to dinner . " Madeline arrived in a black tailored suit with a flaring jacket and a tight sheath skirt , dark hair swept up on her head . It was hard to think of her as only twenty . Possibly she was putting on the young career woman a bit , but she did have to leave the table in the Empire Room twice , when the headwaiter came and said with a bow that CBS was on the telephone . Victor Henry liked her confident , demure manner and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face , she listened to the talk about Germany and about the wedding plans , and said almost nothing . In the studio building , at the reception desk , a stiff , uniformed youngsterawaited them . " Miss Henry 's party ? This way , please . " He took them to a barren low-ceilinged green room where Hugh Cleveland and his staffp335sat around a table . Briskly cordial , Cleveland invited them to stay in the room till the show started . He was looking at cards , memorizing spontaneousjokes he would make later , and discussing them with his gagman . After a while he snapped a rubber band around the cards and slipped them in his pocket . " Well , five minutes to go , " he said , turning to the visitors . " I hear this fellow Churchill gave a pretty good speech . Did you catchIt ? " " Every word , " Rhoda said . " It was shattering . That speech will go down in history . " " Quite a speech , " Pug said . Madeline said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The show 's producer , who looked forty-five and dressed like a college boy , put a manicured hand to the back of his head . " It was fair . It needed cutting and punching up . Too much tutti-frutti . There was one good line about blood and sweat . " " There was ? How would that go with the butcher who plays the zither ? " Cleveland said to the joke writer at his elbow , a melancholy young Jew who needed a haircut . " Could we throw in something about blood and sweat ? " The joke writer sadly shook his head . " Bad taste . " " Do n't be silly , Herbie . Try to think of something . Captain Henry , how 's the war going ? Will the Gamelin Plan stop the Krauts ? " " I do n't know what the Gamelin Plan is . " Madeline put her guests in privileged seats on the stage of the studio , near the table where Cleveland interviewed the amateurs before a huge cardboard display extolling Morning Smile pink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ booth . A large audience , which to Victor Henry seemed composed entirely of imbeciles , applauded the stumbling amateurs and roared at Cleveland 's jokes . Cleveland ran the program with smooth foxy charm ; Pug realized now that Madeline had latched herself to a corner . But the show disgusted him . One amateur identified himself as a line repairman . Cleveland remarked , " Well , haw haw , guess they could use you in France right about now . " " France , Mr. Cleveland ? " " Sure . On that Maginot Line . " He winked at the audience ; they guffawed and clapped . " Does this amuse you ? " Pug said across Rhoda , in a low tone , to PalmerKirby . " I never listen to the radio , " said the engineer . " It 's interesting . Like a visit to a madhouse. "  | " That Cleveland 's cute , though , " Rhoda said . Madeline came to them after the show , as the audience swarmed on stage around Hugh Cleveland seeking his autograph . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the air by news bulletins . They 're so high-handed , those news people ! " " What 's happening ? " Victor Henry asked . " Oh , it 's the war , naturally . Just more of the same . The Germans have overrun some new town , and the French are collapsing , and so on . Nothing very unexpected . Hugh will have a fit when he hears they cut the butcher with the zither . " " Miss Henry ? " A uniformed page approached her . " Yes ? " " Urgent long-distance call , miss , in Mr. Cleveland 's office , for Miss Lacouture . From Puerto Rico . " O n the flying bridge of the fishing boat Blue Bird , rocking gently along at four knots in the Gulf Stream , Byron and Natalie lay in each other'sarms in the sun . Below , the jowly sunburned skipper yawned at the wheel over a can of beer , and the ship-to-shore telephone dimly crackled and gabbled . From long poles fixed in sockets at the empty fighting chairs , lines trailed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swimming suits , the lovers had forgotten the fish , the lines , and the skipper . They had forgottendeath and they had forgotten war . They lay at the center of a circle of dark blue calm water and light blue clear sky . It seemed the sun shone on them alone . The deck echoed with loud rapping from below , four quick knocks like a Morse code V. " Hey , Mr. Henry ! You awake ? " " Sure , what is it ? " Byron called hoarsely , raising himself on an elbow . " They 're calling us from the beach . Your father wants you to come on in . " " My father ? Wrong boat . He 's in Washington . " " Wait one  --  Hello , hello , Blue Bird calling Bill Thomas  --  " They heard the squawking of the ship-to-shore again . " Hey , Mr. Henry . Your fatherishe a naval officer , a captain ? " " That 's right . " " Well , the office has your girl 's mother on the telephone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get back there pronto . " Natalie sat up , her eyes wide and startled . Byron called , " Okay , let 's head back . " " What on earth ? " Natalie exclaimed  | " I have n't the foggiest idea . " The boat , scoring a green-white circle on the dark sea , picked up speed and started to pitch . The wind tumbled Natalie 's long free black hair . She pulled a mirror from a straw basket . " My God , look at me . Look at that mouth . I look gnawed . As though the rats had been at me ! " She put the back of her hand to her lips . " Well , no use trying to patch up this Gorgon 's head till we come in . What can your father want , Briny ? " " Why are you so alarmed ? Probably he 's here with my mother , and she wants a look at you . I ca n't blame her , the way I shot down here . If so , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face turned anxious . She took his hand . " Angel , there 's some Jewish law about not getting married too soon after a parent dies . Possibly for as long as a year , and  --  good heavens ! Do n't make such a face ! I 'm not going to observe that . But I ca n't distress my mother at this point . I need some time to figure this out . " " I do n't want you violating your religion , Natalie , but lord , that 's a blow . " " Sweetie , I was n't planning on marrying you until about an hour ago . " She shook her head and ruefully laughed . " I feel weird . Almost disembodied . Too much sun , or maybe I 'm just drunk on kisses . And now your father suddenly showing up ! Is n't it all like a fever dream ? " He put his arm around her shoulders , holding her close as the boat pitched and rocked more . " Not to me . It 's damned real , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting married . Reality just seems to be starting . " " Yes , no doubt . I certainly do n't look forward to writing to Leslie  --  Jehosephat , that scowl again ! You put it on and off like a Hallowe'en mask , it 's unnerving  --  Briny , he came down to see me right after Papa died . He was remarkably helpful and kind . A new Slote , just a bit too late . He 's been writing to his university friends to find me a teaching job . I wish I knew what your father wanted ! Do n't tell him about us , Byron . Not till I 've talked to my mother . " " You 'd better talk to her right away , then . My father has a way of getting at the facts . " " Oh ! Oh ! " She put both hands to her hair . " I 'm so happy , and so confused , and so upset ! I 'm dizzy . I feel sixteen , which I 'm not , God knows ! Better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bird drew closer in , Byron got the binoculars and scanned the ragged row of skyscraper hotels along the beach . " I thought so . There he is , waiting on the pier . " Natalie , lounging in one of the chairs , sat bolt upright . " Oh , no . You 're sure ? "  | " Right there , pacing back and forth . I know that walk . " She seized her basket and darted into the cabin , saying to the skipper , " Slow down , please . " " Right , miss . " The bewhiskered man , with a grin , pulled back on the throttle . She closed the little door to the forward cabin . Soon she emerged in a cotton skirt and white blouse , her black hair brushed gleaming and loose to her shoulders . " I 'm seasick , " she said to Byron , wanly smiling . " Try putting on eyebrows and a mouth sometime in a rocking boat , in a hot little cabin . Whew ! Am I green ? I feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boat was wallowing half a mile from the pier . Natalie could see the man in blue walking up and down . " Full steam ahead , " she said shakily . " Damn the torpedoes . " Victor Henry , leaning down from the tar-smelling pier , held out a hand as the boat stopped . " Hello , Natalie . This is a helluva thing to do to you . Watch it , do n't step on that nail . " Byron leaped ashore . " What 's up , Dad ? Is everybody all right ? " " Have you two had lunch ? " Pug said . They looked at each other , and Natalie nervously laughed . " I did pack sandwiches . They 're in this basket . We , well , I do n't know , we for got . " An amused look came and went in Victor Henry 's eyes , though his face remained stern . " LIh-huh . Well , the smells from that joint there "  --  he pointed with his thumb at a dilapidated clam bar on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought I 'd wait for you . I have n't eaten yet today . " " Please come to my house . I 'd love to fix you something . " " Your mother was kind enough to give me orange juice and coffee . D' you mind if we go in here ? These waterfront places can be pretty good . " They sat in a tiny plywood booth painted bright red . Byron and his father ordered clam chowder . " I 've never learned to like that stuff , " Natalie said to the waiter . " Can I have a bacon and tomato sandwich ? " " Sure , miss . " Victor Henry looked oddly at her . " What 's the matter ? " she said . " You 're not fussy about what you eat . " She looked puzzled . " Oh . You mean the bacon ? Not in the least , I 'm afraid . Many Jews are n't . " " How about your mother ? " " Well , she has some vague and inconsistent scruples . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite a chat . She 's a clever woman , and holding up remarkp339ably , after her loss . Well ! " Pug put cigarettes and lighter on the table . " It looks like France is really folding , does n't it ? Have you heard the radio this morning ? In Paris they 're burning papers . The BEF is high-tailing it for the Channel , but it may already be too late . The Germans may actuallybag the entire British regular army . " " Good God , " Byron said . " If they do that the war 's over ! How could t his happen in three days ? " " Well , it has . While I was waiting for you I heard the President on my car radio , making an emergency address to a joint session of Congress . He 's asked them for fifty thousand airplanes a year . " " Fifty thousand a year ? " exclaimed Natalie . " Fifty thousand ? Why , that 's just wild talk . " " He said we 'd have to build the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making ' em . In the mood I saw in Washington yesterday , he 's going to get the money , too . The panic is finally on , up there . They 've come awake in a hurry . " Byron said , " None of this can help England or France . " " No . Not in this battle . What Congress is starting to think about is the prospect of us on our own , against Hitler and the Japanese . Now . " Pug lit a cigarette , and began ticking off points against spread stiff fingers . " Warren 's thirty-day leave has been cancelled . The wedding 's been moved up . Warren and Janice are getting married tomorrow . They 'll have a onedayhoneymoon , and then he goes straight out to the Pacific Fleet . So . Number one : You 've got to get to Pensacola by tomorrow at ten . " With a hesitant look at Natalie , who appeared dumbfounded , Byron said , " All right , I 'll be there . " " Okay . Number two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class at sub school , you 've got to report to New London and take the physical by Sat-urday . " " Ca n't I take a physical at Pensacola ? " The father pursed his lips . " I never thought of that . Maybe I can get Red Tully to stretch a point . He 's already doing that , holding this place open for you . The applications are piling up now for that school . " " May 27 ? " Natalie said to Byron . " That 's eleven days from now ! Are you going to submarine school in eleven days ? " " I do n't know . It 's a possibility . " She turned to his father . " How long is the school ? " " It 's three months . " " What will become of him afterward ? " " My guess is he 'll go straight out to the fleet , like Warren . The new subs are just starting to come on the line . "  | " Three months ! And then you 'll be gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk about all that , " Byron said . " Will you come with me to the wedding tomorrow ? " " Me ? I do n't know . I was n't invited . " " Janice asked me to bring you . " " She did ? When ? You never told me that . " Byron turned to his father , " Look , when does the submarine course after this one begin ? " " I do n't know . But the sooner you start , the better . It takes you thirteenmore months at sea to get your dolphins . There 's nothing tougher than qualifying in submarines , Briny . A flier has an easier job . " Byron took one of his father 's cigarettes , lit it , inhaled deeply , and said as he exhaled a gray loud , " Natalie and I are getting married . " With an appraising glance at Natalie , who was biting her lower lip , Victor Henry said , " I see . Well , that might or might not affect your admittanceto the school . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this development . In general , unmarried candidates get the preference in such situations . Still , maybe the thing to do  --  " Natalie broke in , " Captain Henry , I realize it creates many difficulties . We only decided this morning . I myself do n't know when or how . It 's a fearful tangle . " Looking at her from under his eyebrows as he ate , Pug nodded . " There are no difficulties that ca n't be overcome , " said Byron . " Listen , darling , " Natalie said , " the last thing I 'll ever do is stop youfrom going to submarine school . My God , I was in Warsaw ! " Byron smoked , his face blank , his eyes narrowed at his father . Victor Henry looked at his wristwatch and gathered up his cigarettes and lighter . " Well , that 's that . Great chowder . Hits the spot . Say , there's a plane to Pensacola that I can still make this afternoon . " " Why did n't you just telephone all this ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Why did you come here ? " Victor Henry waved the check and a ten-dollar bill at the waiter . " You took off like a rocket , Byron . I did n't know your plans or your state of mind . I was n't even sure you 'd agree to come to the wedding . " " Why , I would n't have heard of his staying away , " Natalie said . " Well , I did n't know that either . I thought I ought to be available to talk to both of you , and maybe answer questions , and use a little persua sion if necessary . " He added to Natalie , " Janice and Warren do expect you . That I can tell you . " She put a hand to her forehead . " I just do n't know if I can come "  | " We 'll be there , " Byron said flatly . " Or at least I will . Does that take care of everything ? " Pug hesitated . " What about sub school ? I told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Captain Tully has to know today , then I 'm out . All right ? " Natalie struck the table with her fist . " Damn it , Byron . Do n't makedecisions like that . " " I do n't know any other way to make decisions . " " You can talk to me . I 'm involved . " Victor Henry cleared his throat . " Well , I 've spoken my piece and I 'll shove off . We can pick this topic up tomorrow . " " Oh ? " Byron 's tone was acid . " Then you do n't really have to call CaptainTully today , after all . " Victor Henry 's face darkened . He leaned back in the hard seat . " See here , Byron . Hitler and the Germans are creating your problem . I 'm not . I 'm calling it to your attention . " ' Well , all this bad news from Europe may be highly exaggerated , and in any case , no American submarine will ever fail to sail because I 'm not in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Natalie said in a choked voice . " Let your father catch his plane . " " Just keep remembering I did n't start this war , Byron , " Victor Henry uaid , in almost the tone he had used on the waiter in Wannsee , picking his white cap off a peg while looking his son in the face . " I think you 'd make a good submariner . They 're all a bunch of goofy individualists . On the other hand , I ca n't hate you for wanting to marry this brilliant and beautiful young lady . And now I 'm getting the hell out of here . " VictorHenry stood . " See you in church . Get there early , you 'll be best man . Wear your dark suit .  --  Good-bye , Natalie . Sorry I broke up your day on the boat . Try to come to Pensacola . " " Yes , sir . " A sad little smile lit her worried face . " Thank you . " When he went out , she turned to Byron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fish . Let 's get out of here . I was half sick during all that . Cod knows how I 've kept from shooting my cookies . " Natalie strode seaward along the wharf , taking deep gulps of air , her skirt fluttering on her swinging hips , the thin blouse wind-flattened on her breasts , her black hair flying . Byron hurried after her . She stopped short at the end of the wharf , where two ragged Negro boys sat fishing , mid turned on him , her arms folded . " Why the devil did you treat your father like that ? " " Like what ? I know why he came here , that 's all , " Byron returned with equal sharpness . " He came to separate us . " His voice rang and twanged much like Victor Henry 's . " Oh , take me home . Straight home . He was utterly right , you know . You 're blaming him for the way the war is going .

" " Even if it 's true , you still have to look at reality , not throw tantrums . " " He did quite a job on you , " said Byron . " He usually gets anything done that he intends to . " They climbed into the car . " That 's how much you know , " she said harshly , slamming her door as he whirred the motor . " I 'm coming to Pensacola with you . All right ? I love you . Now shut up and drive me home . "  |p343With  a groan , to the clatter of an old tin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at seven on his wedding day . Until four he had been in the sweet arms of his bride-to-be in a bedroom of the Calder Arms Hotel , some twenty miles from Pensacola . He stumbled to the shower and turned on the cold water in a gush . As the needling shock brought him to , he wearily wondered whether spending such a night before his wedding morning had n't been somewhat gross . Poor Janice had said she would have to start dressing and packing as soon as she got home . Yes , certainly gross , but ye gods ! Warren laughed aloud , held up his face to the cold water , and started to sing . It was rough , after all  --  a rushed wedding , a one-night honeymoon , and then a separation of thousands of miles ! Too much to ask of human nature . Anyway , it was n't the first time . Still  --  Warren was drying himself with a big rough towel , and cheeringup by the minute  --  there was such a thing as propriety . Such doings on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be torn away from her like this . It was just one of those things , and Hitler 's invasion of France was the real cause , not any looseness in himself or Janice . Truth to tell , the prospect of parting from Janice was not bothering Warren much . She would be coming along to Pearl Harbor in due course . The sudden orders to the Pacific had put him in an excited glow . Crammingin a premature night with Janice had been an impulse of this new bursting love of life he felt . He was rushing to fly a fighter plane from the l I.S.S. Enterprise , because war threatened . It was a star-spangled destiny , a scary ride to the moon . For all his mental motions of regret at leaving Janice , and remorse at having enjoyed her a little too soon and a little too much , Warren 's spirit was soaring . He called the mess steward , ordered double ham and eggs and a jug of coffee , and gaily set about dressing for his nuptials . Byron , standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a crude cartoon tacked to the door : Father Neptune , a lump throbbing on his pate , wrathfully rising from the sea ahead of an aircraft carrier , bran/dishing his trident at an airplane with dripping wheels , out of which the pilot leaned , saluting and shouting , " So sorry ! " " Come in ! " Warren called to his knock . " Wet Wheels ' Henry , I presume ? " Byron quoted the cartoon caption . " Briny ! Hey ! My Christ , how long has it been ? Well , you look great ! God , I 'm glad you made it for the wedding . " Warren ordered more breakfastfor his brother . " Listen , you 've got to tell me all about that wild trip of yours .

" They talked over the food , over coffee , over cigars , and as Warren packed they kept talking , awkwardly at first , then loosening up . Each was taking the other 's measure . Warren was older , heavier in the face , more confident , more than ever on top of the world and ahead of his brother : so Byron felt . Those new gold wings on his white dress uniform seemed to Byron to spread a foot . About flying Warren was relaxed , humorous , and hard . He had mastered the machines and the lingo , and the jokes about his mishaps did n't obscure the leap upward . He still spoke the words " naval aviator " with pride and awe . To Byron , his own close calls under fire had been stumblebum episodes , in no way comparable to Warren 's disciplined rise to fighter pilot . For his part , Warren had last seen Byron setting off to Europe , a hangdog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few pimples , already cooling off about a career in fine arts . Byron 's skin now stretched brown and clear over a sharpened jaw ; his eyes were deeper ; he sat up straighter . Warren was used to the short haircuts and natural shoulder lines of the Navy . Byron 's padded dark Italian suit and mop of reddish hair gave him i dashing appearance that went with his saga of roaming in Poland under German bombs with a beautiful Jewess . Warren had never before envied his younger brother anything . He envied the red stitch-marked scar on his temple  --  his own scar was a mishap , not a war wound  --  and he even somewhat envied him the Jewess , sight unseen . ' What about Natalie , Byron ? Did she come ? " " Sure . I parked her at Janice 's house . That was decent of Janice , telephoningher last night . Did Dad put her up to it ? " " He just said the girl was n't sure she was expected . Say , that thing 's serious , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand and a uniform jacket in the other , and looked hard at his brother.  | " We 're getting married . " " You are ? Good for you . " " Do you mean that ? " " Sure . She sounds like a marvellous girl . " " She is . I know the religious problem exists  --  " Warren grinned and ducked his head to one side . " Ah , Byron , nowadays  --  doesit really ? If you wanted the ministry  --  or politics , say  --  you 'd have to give it more thought . Christ , with the war on and the whole world coming apart , I say grab her . I look forward to meeting that girl . Is n't she a Ph.D . or something ? " " She was going for an M.A. at the Sorbonne . " " Brother ! I 'd be more scared of her than of a carrier landing at night in a line squall . " Byron 's grin showed possessive pride . " I was around her six months , and never opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she loved me . I 'm still trying to believe it . " " Why not ? You 've gotten damned handsome , my lad . You 've lost that string-bean look . You marrying up now , or after sub school ? " " Who the devil says I 'm going to sub school ? Do n't start that . I get enough from Dad . " Warren deftly moved clothes from bureau to a foot locker . " But he 's right , Byron . You do n't want to wait till you get called up . If you do they 'll shove you around , rush you through , and you may not even draw the duty you want . You can pick your spot now and get decent training . Say , have you given naval aviation any thought ? Why do you want to go crawling around at four knots , three hundred feet underwater , when you can fly ? I get claustrophobia just thinking about subs . You might make a great flier . One thing you are is relaxed . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk in Berlin on the sinking of the Royal Oak . " That was a brave exploit , " said Warren . " A real score . Even Churchilladmitted that . Very romantic . I guess that 's what attracts you . But this is an air war , Briny . Those Germans have n't got that much of an edge on the ground . The papers keep talking panzers , panzers , but the French have more and better tanks than the Germans . They 're not using them . They 've been panicked by those Stukas , which just use our own divebombingtactics . " " That 's what got me , a Stuka , " Byron said . " It did n't look that scary . Fixed wheels , single engine , medium size , kind of slow and awkward . " Tossing Byron a large gray book , Warren said with a grin , " Take a look through The Flight Jacket . I 'm there in Squadron Five , tying on my solo flags . I 've got to pay some bills , then we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the yearbook when his brother returned . " Holy cow , Warren , number one in ground school ! How 'd you do that and court Janice , too ? " " It took a toll . " Warren made an exhausted face , and they both laughed . " Bookwork is never too tough when you organize it . " Byron held up the yearbook , pointing to a black-bordered page . " These fellows all got it ? " Warren 's face sobered . " Yep . Frank Monahan was my instructor , and a great flier . " He sighed and looked around the barren room , hands on hips . " Well , I 'm not sorry to leave this room . Eleven months I 've sweated in here . " Pensacola might look small and sleepy , Warren said as they drove into town , but it had perfect climate , great water sports , fine fishing , good golf and riding clubs , and up-and-coming industries . This was the real Florida , not that Brooklyn with palm trees called Miami . These rural western @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congressman Lacouturehad had no competition . He had recently decided to run for the Senate in the fall , and his chances were considered excellent . Warren said he and Janice might well come back here one day . " When you retire ? " Byron said . " That 's looking far ahead . " " Possibly before then . " With a side glance , Warren took in Byron 's astonishment . " Listen , Briny , the day I soloed , President Roosevelt fired the Commander-in-Chief of the United States Fleet . Some dispute over policy for the Asiatic Fleet . Made him ambassador to Turkestan , or something , but actually just kicked him out . CinCus himself ! In the Navy you 're just a hired man , my lad , right on up that big climb through the bureaus and the shore stations and the sea billets . Right to the top . Do n't ever tell Dad I talked like this . Janice is an only child and the Lacouturc firm does twenty million a year . Of course , as long as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Inside the pink stone church topped by a square bell tower , two men in smocks were finishing up a huge flower display , and an unseen organist was rippling a Bach prelude . " Nobody can say I kept her waiting at the church , " Warren said . " Almost an hour to go . Well , we can talk . It 's cool in here . " They sat halfway down the rows of empty purple-cushioned pews . The music , the odor of the flowers , the unmistakable childhood smell of church , hit Byron hard . He felt again what it was like to be a reverent boy ,  |p347sitting  or standing beside his father , joining in the hymns , or trying to follow the minister 's talk about the misty and wonderful Lord Jesus . Marrying Natalie , there would be no such wedding as this . What kind could they have ? A church was altogether out of the question . What was it like to be married by a rabbi ? They had not discussed that part at all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silence . Warren was again regretting , in a fashion , last night 's indulgence , and making half-hearted pious resolves . The feelings of a bridegroom were coming over him . " Briny , say something . I 'm getting nervous . Who knows when we 'll have a chance to talk again ? " Byron wistfully smiled , and it struck Warren once more how goodlookinghis brother had become . " Long time since you and I went to church together . " " Yes . Janice likes to go . I guess if these walls are n't falling in on me now , there 's still hope for me . You know , Briny , all this may work out pretty well . If you do get into subs , you can put in for duty at Pearl . Maybe the four of us will end up there together for a couple of years . Would n't that be fine ? " Natalie had often visited the homes of wealthy college friends , but she was not prepared for the Lacouture mansion , a rambling stone house on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mossy stucco wall , an ironfencedentrance , and an iron-faced gatekeeper . Gentility , seclusion , exclusion , were all around her . The rooms upon rooms of antique furniture , Persian rugs , grandfather clocks , large oil portraits , heavy worn draperies , ironwork , gilt-framed big mirrors , old-fashioned photographs  --  the whole place unsettled her . Janice scampered to meet her in a fluttery pink housecoat , her blonde hair tumbling to her shoulders . " Hi ! So sweet of you to come on this short notice . Look at me . I did n't sleep all night . I 'm so tired I ca n't see . I 'll never be ready . Let 's get you some breakfast . " " Please , just put me in a corner somewhere till we go . I 'm fine . " Janice scanned her with weary but keen big hazel eyes . This happy girl , all pink and gold , made Natalie the more conscious of her own dark eyes , dark hair , wrinkled linen suit , and sad dowdy look . " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're pretty . Come along . " Janice took her to a breakfast alcove facing the water , where a maid brought her eggs and tea in old blue-and-white china on a silver tray . She ute and felt better , if no more at home . Outside , sailboats tacked here and there in the sunshine . Clocks struck nine in the house , one after the other , bonging and chiming . She could hear excited voices upstairs.  |p348She  took the letter from her purse , where it had seemed a lump of lead all the way from Miami : five single-space pages so faintly typed that her eyes ached to read them . Obviously A.J. was not going to learn to change a typewriter ribbon till he died . It was a long tale of woe . He had a fractured ankle . With a French art critic , an old friend , he had gone on a tour of cathedrals the week after Byron had left . At Orvieto , mounting a ladder to look at an inaccessible fresco , he had slipped and fallen to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mixed-up citizenship problem , which for the first time he was taking seriously . He had " derivative citizenship " from his father 's naturalization around 1900 ; but because of his long residence out of the country , difficultieshad arisen . There seemed to be conflicting records of his age at the time of his father 's naturalization . The man in Rome , a decent enough person to talk to but an obsessive bureaucrat , had pressed searching questions and demanded more and more documents , and Aaron had left Rome in deep confusion . Aaron wrote : I may have made a mistake at that point , but I decided to drop the whole thing . This was in December of last year . It seemed to me that I was like the fly blundering into a spider web ; the more I 'd struggle , the tighter I 'd become enmeshed . I did n't really want to go home just then . I assumed that if I let the thing cool off and asked for the passport renewal later  --  especially if some other consul general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a question of a purple stamp and a two-dollar fee . It seemed unthinkable to me then , and still does now , that I could actually be denied permission to return to my own country , where I am even listed in Who 's Who ! During the spasm of alarm over Norway , he had once visited the Florence consulate . There a " shallow but seemingly affable crew-cut type " had conceded that these were all silly technicalities , that Dr. Jastrow was certainly an eminent and desirable person , and that the consular service would somehow solve the difficulty . Much relieved , Jastrow had gone off on the cathedral tour , fractured his ankle , and thus missed an appointment to return to the consulate two weeks later . The letter continued : What comes next I still can not understand . It was either incredible stupidity or incredible malevolence . Crew-cut wrote a letter to me . The tone was polite enough . The gist was that as a stateless person in wartime I faced serious complications , but he thought he had found a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain special classes of refugees . If I were to apply under that law , I probably would have no further trouble , being a prominent Jew . That was his recommendation.  |p349Do  you realize the full depth of the stupidity and the damage in his letter ? I received it only five days ago . I 'm still boiling . To begin with he wants me to abandon all claim to being an American  --  which I am , whether my papers are in order or not  --  and to enlist myself in the mob of clamoringJewish refugees from Europe seeking admittance as hardship cases ! But that is n't the worst of it . He put all this on paper and he put it in the mail . I can not believe that even such a dullard does n't know that a letter from the consular office to me would be opened and read by the Italians . I 'll never know why Crew-cut did it , but I 'm forced to suspect a trace of anti-Semitism . That bacillus is in the European air , and in certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my problem . That alarmingly increases my vulnerability here . I 've been sitting in the lovely sunshine of the terrace day after day , in a wheelchair , alone except for Italian servants , growing more and more perturbed . Finally I decided to write to you , and give the letter to my French friend to mail . Natalie , I have certainly been heedless about a serious matter . I can only plead that before the war these things seemed of no consequence . To you I 'm sure they still do n't . You were born on American soil . I was born on the banks of the Vistula . I am getting a late lesson in the vast difference that makes , and in the philosophy of personal identity . I really should straighten my situation out . Happily , there 's no desperate urgency in it . Siena 's tranquil , food 's plentiful again , my ankle 's healing , and the war is distant summer thunder . I am getting on with my work , but I had better clarify my right to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the villain with the moustache will make his next move . Now will you tell all this to Leslie Slote ? There he sits in Washington , at the heart of things . A hangman 's noose of red tape can be cut by one word spoken in the right place . If he still has a shred of regard for me , let him look into this . I could write him directly but I know we 'll get faster action if you go to him . I beg you to do this . Jastrow wrote a touching paragraph about Natalie 's father . He blamed their estrangement on himself . The scholarly temperament was a self-absorbed one . He hoped that he could treat her as a daughter , though e father 's place could never really be filled . Then came the passage about Byron which had prevented Natalie from showing him the letter . Have you seen Byron yet ? I miss him . He has a curiously charming presence  --  triste , humorous , reserved , virile . I 've never known a more winning boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his twenties should n't seem a boy , but he does . An aureole of romance plays about him . Byron might be all right if he had any talent , or a vestige of drive.  |p350Sometimes  he shows doggedness : and he has a way of coming out with bright flashes . He said Hegel 's world-spirit was just God minus Christianity . That 's commonplace enough , but he added it was much easier to believe in God 's sacrificing Himself for mankind , than in His groping to understand Himself through the unfolding of mankind 's stupidities . I rather liked that . Unhappily it was the one good thing amid many banalities such as , " This Nietzsche was just some kind of a nut , " and " Nobody would bother reading Fichte , if anybody could understand him . " If I 'd marked Byron for our seminar on the Slote Reading List , he 'd have made a C minus . Often I came upon him reading your letters over and over in the lemon house . The poor lad has a terrible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ? I hope you wo n't inadvertently hurt him , and I rather wonder at your writing him so often . For all my troubles , I 've been a reasonably good boy , and stand on manuscript page 847 of Constantine . A clock chiming the half hour brought Natalie back with a start from the terrace in Siena  --  where in her mind 's eye she could see A.J. sitting wrapped in his blue shawl , writing these words  --  to the Lacouture mansionon Pensacola Bay . " Oh God , " she muttered , " oh my God . " Feet trampled on a staircase ; many voices called , laughed , chattered . The bride came sailing down the long dining room , wheat-colored hall beautifully coiffed and laced with pearls , cheeks pink with pleasure . " Well , I did it . Here we go . " Natalie jumped to her feet , cramming A.J. ' s pages into her purse . " Oh , you 're enchanting ! You 're the loveliest sight ! " Janice pirouetted clear around on a toe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to flanks and breasts like creamy skin , rose demurely to cover her throat . She moved in a cloud of white lace . This blend of white chastity and crude fleshy allure was devastating ; it shook Natalie with envy . The bride 's eye had an ironic gleam . After her wild pre-wedding night , Janice Lacouture felt approximately as virginal as Catherine of Russia . It did n't bother her . Rather , it appealed to her sense of humor . " Come , " she said . " You 'll ride with me . " She took the Jewish girl 's arm . " You know , if I were n't marrying Warren Henry , I 'd give you a run for that little Briny . He 's an Adonis , and so sweet . Those Henry men ! " Rhoda arrived at the hotel in a flurry , and frantically bathed and dressed , pulling cosmetics from one valise , underwear from another , he new Bergdorf Goodman frock from a third . Dr. Kirby had chartered .  |p351small  plane and had flown down with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trilled Rhoda , dashing about in a sheer green slip . " The last plane we could get from New York did n't leave us a MINUTE to finish shopping . Your daughter and I would have come to this wedding in OLD RAGS . This way , we had a whole extra afternoon and , Pug , you never SAW such fast shopping . Is n't this a cunning number ? " She held the green frock against her bosom . " Found it at the last second . Honestly , a small plane is such FUN . I slept most of the way , but when I was awake it was GREAT . You really know you 're flying . " " Damn nice of him , " Pug said . " Is Fred that rich ? " " Well , of course , I would n't hear of it , but then he said it was all charged to his company . He 's taking the plane on to Birmingham today . Anyway , I was n't going to argue too much , dear . It was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did Briny really bring that Jewish girl here ? Of all things . Why , I 've never even laid eyes on her . She 'll have to sit with us , and everybody 'll think she 's part of the family . " " Looks like she will be , Rhoda . " " I do n't believe it . I just do n't . Why , how much older is she ? Four years ? That Briny ! Just enjoys giving us heart failure . Always has , the monster . Pug , what 's taking you so long ? My land , it 's hot here . " " She 's two years older , and terrifically attractive . " ' Well , you 've got me curious , I 'll say that . I pictured her as one of these tough Brooklyn chickens who shove past you in the New York departmentstores . Oh , stop fumbling , I 'll finish the top ones . Mercy , I 'm roasting ! I 'm perspiring IN RIVERS . This dress will be black through before we get to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handsome woman in green chiffon and rose-decorated white straw hat did n't like her . The polite handshakeoutside the church , the prim smile , told all . Pug presented Natalie to Madeline as " Byron 's sidekick on the Polish jaunt , " obviously trying with this clumsy jocularity to make up for his wife 's freeze . " Oh , yes , wow ! Some adventure ! " Madeline Henry smiled and looked Natalie over . Her pearl-gray shantung suit was the smartest outfit in sight . " I want to hear all about that , some time . I still have n't seen Briny , you know , and it 's been more than two years . " " He should n't have rushed down to Miami the way he did , " Natalie said , feeling her cheeks redden . " Why not ? " said Madeline , with a slow Byron-like grin . It was strange to see echoes of his traits in his family . Mrs. Henry held her head as Byron did , erect on a long neck . It made him seem more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her young companion of Jastrow 's library and ofp352Poland , or even the son of a forbidding father , but part of a quite alien group . The church was full . From the moment she went in , Natalie felt uncomfortable . Cathedrals gave her no uneasiness . They were just sights to see , and Roman Catholicism , though she could write a good paper about it , was like Mohammedanism , a complex closed-off structure . A Protestant church was the place of the other religion , the thing she would be if she were n't a Jew . Coming into one , she trod hostile territory . Rhoda did n't make quite enough room for her in the pew , and Natalie had to push her a little , murmuring an excuse , to step clear of the aisle . All around , women wore bright or pastel colors . Officers and air cadetsin white and gold abounded . And there Natalie stood at a May wedding in black linen , hastily selected out of a vague sense that she was still in mourning and did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was n't her imagination ; they did . How charming and fine the church was , with its dark carved wooden ceiling arching up from pink stone walls ; and what stunning masses of flowers ! How pleasant , comfortable , and normal to be born an Episcopalian or a Methodist , and how perfect to be married this way ! Perhaps A.J. was right , and encouraging Byron had been irresponsible . Leslie Slote was an arid bookish pagan like herself , and they had even talked of being married by a judge . The robed minister appeared , book in hand , and the ceremony began . As the bride paced down the aisle on the congressman 's arm , movinglike a big beautiful cat , Rhoda started to cry . Memories of Warren as a little boy , memories of her own wedding , of other weddings , of young men who had wanted to marry her , of herself  --  a mother before twenty of the baby who had grown into this handsome groom  --  flooded her mind ; she bowed her head in the perky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she lost her awareness of the melancholy Jewish girl in black beside her , and even of Palmer Kirby towering above people three rows back . When Victor Henry softly took her hand , she clasped his and pressed it to her thigh . What fine sons they had , standing up there together ! And Pug stood slightly hunched , almost at attention , his face sombre and rigid , wondering at the speed with which his life was going , and realizingagain how little he allowed himself to think about Warren , because he had such inordinately high hopes for him . Standing up beside his brother , Byron felt many eyes measuring and comparing them . Warren 's uniform , and the other uniforms in the church , troubled him . His Italian suit with its exaggerated lines , beside Warren'sp353naturally cut whites , seemed to Byron as soft and frivolous as a woman 's dress . As Janice lifted her veil for the kiss , she and Warren exchanged a deep , knowing , intimately amused glance . " How are you doing ? " he murmured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how , you dog . " And with the minister beaming on them , they embraced , kissed , and laughed , there in the church in each other 's arms , over the war-born joke that would last their whole lives and that nobody else would ever know . C ars piled up in front of the beach club , only a few hundred yards from the Lacouture house , and a jocund crowd poured into the canopied entrance for the wedding brunch . " I swear , I must be the only Jew in Pensacola , " Natalie said , hanging back a little on Byron 's arm . " When I walk through that door , I 'm going to set off gongs . " He burst out laughing . " It 's not quite that bad . " She looked pleased at making him laugh . " Maybe not . I do think yourother might be a wee bit happier if a wall had fallen on me in Warsaw . " At that moment , Rhoda , half a dozen paces behind them , wasponding to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Yes , does n't she ? So interesting . She might almost be an Armeianor an Arab . Byron met her in Italy . " Champagne glass in hand , Byron firmly took Natalie around the dding party from room to room , introducing her . " Do n't say I 'm your ncee , " Natalie ordered him at the start . " Let them think what they case , but do n't let 's get into all that . " She met Captain Henry 's father , engineer retired from the lumber trade , a short withered upright man ith thick white hair , who had travelled in from California and who ked as though he had worked hard all his life ; and his surprisingly fat other , who ran a soft-drink business in Seattle ; and other Henrys ; and knot of Rhoda 's kin , Grovers of Washington . The clothes , the manners , c speech of the Washington relatives set them off not only from the alifornia people , but even from Lacouture 's Pensacola friends , who by mparison seemed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joking , eating , drinking , and dancing . Nobody would have blamed them , in view of their limited time , for vanishing after a round of handshakes , but they evinced no impatience for the joys of their new state . Warren asked Natalie to dance , and as soon as they were out on the floor , he said , " I told Byron this morning that I 'm for you . That was sight unseen . " " Do you always take such blind risks ? A flier should be more pru-dent . " " I know about what you did in Warsaw . That 's enough . " " You 're cheering me up . I feel awfully out of place here . " " You should n't . Janice is as much for you as I am . Byron seems changed already , " Warren said . " There 's a lot to him , but nobody 's ever pressed the right button . I 've always hoped that some day a girl would , and I think you 're the girl . " Rhoda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gathered them up to join a large family table by the window . Possibly because of the wine , she was acting more cordial to Natalie . At the table Lacouture was declaring , with relish for his own pat phrases , that the President 's request for fifty thousand airplanes a year was " politically hysterical , fiscally irresponsible , and industrially inconceivable . " Even the German air force did n't have ten thousand planes all told ; and it did n't have a single bomber that could fly as far as Scotland , let alone across the Atlantic . A billion dollars ! The interventionist press was whooping it up , naturally , but if the debate in Congress could go on for more than a week , the appropriationwould be licked . " We have three thousand miles of good green water between us and Europe , " he said , " and that 's better protection for us than half a million airplanes . Roosevelt just wants new planes in a hurry to give to England and France . But he 'll never come out and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candor . " " You 're willing to see the British and French go down , then , " Pug Henry said . " That 's how the question 's usually put , " said Lacouture . " Ask me if I 'm willing to send three million American boys overseas against the Germans , so as to prop up the old status quo in Europe . Because that 's what this is all about , and do n't ever forget it . " Palmer Kirby put in , " The British navy 's propping up our own status quo free of charge , Congressman . If the Nazis get hold of it , that 'll extend Hitler 's reach to Pensacola Bay . " Lacouture said jovially , " Yes , I can just see the Rodney and the Nelsonright out there , flying the swastika and shelling our poor old beach club . " This raised a laugh among the assorted in-laws around the table , and Rhoda said , " What a charming thought . " Victor Henry said , " This is n't where they 'll come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Lacouture said . " That 's New York Timesp355stuff . If the British get in a jam , they 'll throw out Churchill and make a deal with Germany . But naturally they 'll hang on as long as they think t here 's a chance that the Roosevelt administration , the British sympathizers , and the New York Jews will get us over there . " " I 'm from Denver , " said Kirby , " and I 'm Irish . " He and Victor Henry had glanced at Natalie when Lacouture mentioned the Jews . " Well , error is contagious , " said the congressman with great good nature , " and it knows no boundaries . " This easy amused war talk over turkey , roast beef , and champagne , by a broad picture window looking out at beach umbrellas , white sand , and heeling sailboats , had been irritating Natalie extremely . Lacouture 's last sentence stung her to say in a loud voice , " I was in Warsaw during the siege . " Lacouture calmly said , " That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pretty bad , was it ? " " The Germans bombed a defenseless city for three weeks . They knocked out all the hospitals but one , the one I worked in . The wounded were piled up in our entrance hall like logs . In one hospital a lot of pregnant women burned up . " The table became a hole of quiet in the boisterous party . The congressmanspun an empty champagne glass between two fingers . " That rt of thing has been going on in Europe for centuries , my dear . It 's exactly what I want to spare the American people . " " Say , I heard a good one yesterday , " spoke up a jolly-faced man in eel-rimmed glasses , laughing . " Abey and his family , see , are driving down Miami , and about Tampa they run out of gasoline . Well , they drive to this filling station , and this attendant says , Juice ? ' And old Abey he ys , Nell , vot if ve are ? Dunt ve get no gess ? ' The jolly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Natalie could ice he meant no harm ; he was trying to ease the sober turn of the talk . till she was very glad that Byron came up now and took her off to dance . " How long does this go on ? " she said . " Can we go outside ? I do n't ant to dance . " " Good . I have to talk to you . " They sat on the low wall of the terrace in blazing sun , by stairs lead-g to the white sand , not far from the picture window , behind which couture was still holding forth , shaking his white-thatched head and aving an arm . Byron leaned forward , elbows on knees , fingers clasped together . Darling , I think I 'm getting organized here . I may as well fly up to New London today or tomorrow and take that physical , so that  --  what 's the matter ? " A spasm had crossed her face . " Nothing , go on . You 're flying to New London . " " Only if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't concur on , from now on and for ever . " " All right . " " Well , I take the physical . I also check the situation , and make very sure that a married applicant has a chance , and that if he 's admitted he gets to spend time with his wife . That takes care of our first few months , maybe our first year . I 'll eventually go to one submarine base or another , if I get through , and you 'll come along , the way Janice is doing . We all might end up at Pearl Harbor together . There 's a university in Hawaii . You might even teach there . " " Goodness , you 've been thinking with might and main , have n't you ? " Victor Henry came through the doors to the terrace . Byron looked up , and said coolly and distantly , " Hi , looking for me ? " " Hi . I understand you 're driving Madeline to the airport . Do n't leave without me . I just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Your mother 's staying on . " " When 's the plane ? " Natalie said . " One-forty . " " Can you lend me some money ? " she said to Byron . " I think I 'll go to Washington on that plane . " Pug said , " Oh ? Glad to have your company , " and went back into the club . " You 're going to Washington ! " Byron said . " Why there , for crying out loud ? " She put a cupped palm to Byron 's face . " Something about Unc I y Aaron 's citizenship . While you 're in New London , I can take care of it . My God , what 's the matter ? You look as though you 've been shot . " " You 're mistaken . I 'll give you the fare . " " Byron , listen , I do have to go there , and it would be plain silly to fly down to Miami and then right back up to Washington . Ca n't you sec that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I said I 'd give you the fare . " Natalie sighed heavily . " Darling , listen , I 'll show you Aaron 's letter . He asked me to talk to Leslie Slote about his passport problem , it 's beginning to worry him . " She opened her purse . " What 's the point ? " Byron stiffly stood up . " I believe you . " Warren insisted on coming to the airport , though Pug tried to protestp357that the bridegroom surely had better things to do with his scanty time . " How do I know when I 'll see all of you again ? " Warren kept saying . Rhoda and Janice got into the argument , and the upshot was that the llenrys plus the bride and Natalie all piled into Lacouture 's Cadillac . Rhoda on the way out had snatched a bottle of champagne and some glasses . " This family has been GYPPED by this miserable , stupid war , " she declared , handing the glasses around as Byron started up the car . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? And we ca n't even stay together for twelve hours ! Well , I say , if it 's going to be a short reunion it 's damn well going to be a merry one . Somebody sing something ! " So they sang " Bell Bottom Trousers " and " She Wore a Yellow Ribbon " and " I 've Got Sixpence " and " Auld Lang Syne " as the Cadillac rolled toward the airport . Natalie , crowded between Rhoda and Madeline , tried to join in , but " Auld Lang Syne " was the only song she knew . Rhoda pressed a glass on her , and filled it until wine foamed over the girl 's fingers . " Oops , sorry , dear . Well , it 's a mercy your suit 's black , " she said , moppingat Natalie 's lap with her handkerchief . When the car drove through the airport entrance they were singing one Natalie had never even heard , a family favorite that Pug had brought from California : Till we meet , till we meet Till we meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meetGod be with you till we meet againand Rhoda Henry was crying into her champagne-soaked handkerchief , stating that these were tears of happiness over Warren 's wonderful marriage.  |p361As  France was caving in , people began at last to perceive that a mainturn of mankind 's destiny now hung on flying machines . Of these there were only a few thousand on the planet . The propeller warplanes of 1940 were modestly destructive , compared to aircraft men have built since . But they could shoot each other down , and unopposed , they could set fire to cities far behind battle lines . Massive bombing of cities from the air had , for some years after the First World War , been considered war 's ultimate and unthinkable horror . But by 1940 , the Germans had not only thought of it , but had twice done it : in the Spanish Civil War and in Poland . The Japanese , too , had bombed China 's cities from the air . Evidently the ultimate horror was quite thinkable , though the civilized term for it , strategic bombing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Englandtherefore had to face a bitter decision : whether to send their few precious planes to fight over France against the Germans , or hold them back to defend the homeland 's cities and shores . The French had even fewer planes . In the years before the war , instead of constructing an air fleet , the French had built their Maginot Line . Their military thinkers had argued that aircraft were the scouts and stinginginsects of war , useful , annoying , hurtful , but incapable of forcing a decision . As the French state , under the punch of German dive bombers , flew to pieces like a Limoges vase hit by a bullet , its premier issued a suddenfrantic public appeal to President Roosevelt to send " clouds of airplanes . " But there were no clouds to send . Maybe the French premier did not know what a paltry air force America had , or that even then , no fighter plane in existence could travel more than a couple of hundred miles . The level of information among French politicians at the time was low . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ British pilots had learned something important . They could knock down German flying machines . They knocked down many ; but many British planes fell too . As the Battle of France went on , the French implored their retreating allies to throw in all their aircraft . This the British did not do . Their air commander , Dowding , told Winston Churchill that twenty-five squadronshad to be kept intact to save England , and Churchill listened to him . The French collapse thus became foredoomed , if it had ever been anything else . At the height of the debacle , on June 9 , in a letter to old General Smuts , Winston Churchill explained himself . The military sage had reprovedhim for failing to observe a first principle of war : Concentrate everything at the decisive point . Churchill pointed out that with the shortrangedfighter planes then in the air on both sides , the side that fought nearer its airdromes had a big advantage . " The classical principles are in this case modified by the actual quantitative date , " he wrote . " I see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hitler should attack this country , and in so doing break his air weapon . If this happens , he will be left to face the winter with Europe writhing under his heel , and probably with the United States against him after the presidential election is over . " Winston Churchill , today an idealized hero of history , was in his time variously considered a bombastic blunderer , an unstable politician , an intermittently inspired orator , a reckless self-dramatizer , a voluminous able writer in an old-fashioned vein , and a warmongering drunkard . Through most of his long life he cut an antic , brilliant , occasionally absurd figure in British affairs . He never won the trust of the people until 1940 , when he was sixty-six years old , and before the war ended they dismissed him . But in his hour he grasped the nature of Hitler , and sensed the way to beat him : that is , by holding fast and pushing him to the assault of the whole world , the morbid German dream of rule or ruin , of dominion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the strategic situation , and with the words of his mouth he inspired the British people to share his vision . By keeping back the twenty-five squadrons from the lost Battle of France , he acted toughly , wisely , and ungallantly ; and he turned the war to the course that ended five long years later , when Hider killed himself and Nazi Germany fell apart . This deed put Winston Churchill in the company of the rare saviors of countries , and perhaps of civilizations . With France and the Low Countries overrun , and the Germans at the Channel , England now lay within range of the Luftwaffe 's fighter planes . The United States was safe from air attack in 1940 , but the onrollingconquest of Europe by the Germans , combined with the growing menace of Japan , posed a danger to the future safety of the United States . The question arose : if selling warplanes to the British would en/able them to go on knocking down German aircraft , killing German pilots , and wrecking German bomber factories , might not that be , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aging craft while new , bigger , and stronger machines were built in the inaccessible sanctuary across the ocean ? The answer , from the United States Navy , the Army , the War Department , the Congress , the press , and the public , was a roaring NO ! Franklin Roosevelt wanted to help the British , but he had to reckon with that great American NO ! Churchill , with the power of a wartime chief of state , had not sent planes to France , because the survival of England depended on them . Roosevelt , presiding over a wealthy huge land at peace , could not even sell planes to England without risking impeachment . It was a shock for Victor Henry to see Franklin Roosevelt out from behind the desk in a wheelchair . The shirt-sleeved President was massive and powerful-looking down to the waist ; below that , thin seersucker trousers hung pitifully baggy and loose on his fleshless thigh bones and slack lower legs . The crippled man was looking at a painting propped on a chair . Beside him stood the Vice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew well : a spare withered little naval aviator , one of the surviving pioneers , with a lipless mouth , a scarred red face , and ferocious tangled white eyebrows . " Hello there ! " The President gave Victor Henry a hearty handshake , his grip warm and damp . It was a steamy day , and though the windows of the oval study were open , the room was oppressively hot . " You know Captain Henry , of course , Admiral ? His boy 's just gotten his wings at Pensacola . How about this picture , Pug ? Like it ? " Inside the heavy ornate gold frame , a British man-o ' - war under full sail tossed on high seas beneath a storm-wracked sky and a lurid moon . " It 's fine , Mr. President . Of course I 'm a sucker for sea scenes . " " So am I , but d' you know he 's got the rigging wrong ? " The President accurately pointed out the flaws , with great relish for his own expertise . " Now how about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was paint a sailing ship  --  that was his whole job  --  and he got the rigging wrong ! It 's positively unbelievable what people will do wrong , given half a chance . Well , that thing 's not going to hang in here . " During all this , the admiral was training his eyebrows like weapons at Victor Henry . Years ago , in the Bureau of Ordnance , they had violently disagreed over the deck plating on the new carriers . Junior though he was , Henry had carried his point , because of his knowledge of metallurgy . The President now turned his chair away from the painting , and glanced at a silver clock on his desk shaped like a ship 's wheel . " Admiral , what about it ? Are we going to put Pug Henry to work on that little thing ? Will he do ? " " Well , if you assigned Pug Henry to paint a square-rigger , Mr. President , " the admiral replied nasally , with a none too kind look at Pug , " you might not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As I say , a naval aviator would be a far more logical choice , sir , but  --  " He gestured reluctantsubmission , with an upward chop of a hand . The President said , " We went through all that . Pug , I assume somebodycompetent is tending shop for you in Berlin ? " " Yes , sir . " Roosevelt gave the admiral a glance which was a command . Picking his white hat off a couch , the admiral said , " Henry , see me at my office tomorrow morning at eight . " " Aye aye , sir . " Victor Henry was left alone with the President of the United States . Roosevelt sighed , smoothed his thin rumpled gray hair , and rolled himself to his desk . Victor Henry now noticed that the President did not use an ordinary invalid 's wheelchair , but an odd piece of gear , a sort of kitchen chair on wheels , in and out of which he could easily slide himself . " Golly , the sun 's going down , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weary , as he contemplated papers piled on the desk . " Is n't it about time for a drink ? Would you like a martini ? I 'm supposed to mix a passable martini . " " Nothing better , sir . " The President pressed a buzzer . A grizzled tall Negro in a gray gabardine jacket appeared and deftly gathered papers and folders out ofvarious trays , while Roosevelt pulled wrinkled papers from one pocketand another , made quick pencilled notes , jabbed papers on a spike andthrew others in a tray . " Let 's go , " he said to the valet . " Come along , Pug . " All down one long hall , and in the elevator , and down another hall , the President glanced at papers and scrawled notes , puffing at the cigarette holder in his teeth . His gusto for the work was evident , despite theheavy purple fatigue smudges under his eyes and the occasional deepcoughs racking his chest . They arrived in a small dowdy sitting room hungwith sea paintings . " That thing is n't going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It 's going in the cellar . " He handed all the papers to thevalet , who wheeled a chromium-stripped bar beside his chair and left " Well , how was the wedding , Pug ? Did your boy get himself a pretty bride ? " said the President in chatty and warm , if faintly lordly tones , measuring out gin and vermouth like an apothecary . Henry thought that perhaps the cultured accent made him sound more patronizing than he intended to be . Roosevelt wanted to know about the Lacouture house , and wryly laughed at Victor Henry 's account of his argument with the congressman . " Well , that 's what we 're up against here . And Ike Lacouture 's an intelligent man . Some of them are just contrary and obstinate fools . if we get Lacouture in the Senate , he 'll give us real trouble . " A very tall woman in a blue-and-white dress came in , followed by a small black dog . " Just in time ! Hello there , doggie ! " exclaimed the President , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him and put its paws on the wheelchair . " This is the famous Pug Henry , dear . " " Oh ? What a pleasure . " Mrs. Roosevelt looked worn but energetic : an imposing , rather ugly woman of middle age with fine skin , a wealth of soft hair , and a smile that was gentle and sweet , despite the protruding teeth stressed in all the caricatures . She firmly shook hands , surveying Pug with the astute cool eyes of a flag officer . " The Secret Service has an unkind name for my dog , " Roosevelt said , handing his wife a martini . " They call him The Informer . They say he gives away where I am . As though there were only one little black Scottie in the world . Eh , Fala ? " " What do you think of the way the war 's going , Captain ? " said Mrs.Roosevelt straight off , sitting in an armchair and holding the drink in her lap . " It 's very bad , ma'am , obviously . " Roosevelt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a while to answer . " Well , sir , in Berlin they were mighty sure that the western campaign would be short . Way back in January , all their government war contracts had a terminal date of July first . They thought it would all be over by then and they 'd be demobilizing . " Roosevelt 's eyes widened . " That fact was never brought to my attention . That 's extremely interesting . " Mrs. Roosevelt said , " Meantime , are they suffering hardships ? " Victor Henry described the " birthday present for the Fuhrer " drive , collecting household tin , copper , and bronze ; the newsreel of Goring addingbusts of himself and Hitler to a mountain of pots , pans , and irons , and washtubs ; the death penalty announced for collectors caught taking anything for their own use ; the slogan , One pan per house ; ten thousand tons for the Fuhrer . He talked of snowbound Berlin , the lack of fuel , the food rationing , the rule that a spoiled frozen potato had to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law , except for foreigners and sick people , to hail a taxi in Berlin . Russian food deliveries were coming in slowly , if at all , so the Nazis were wrapping butter from Czechoslovakia in Russian-printed packages to foster the feeling of Soviet support . The " wartimebeer , " a uniform brew reduced in hops and alcohol content , was undrinkable , but the Berliners drank it . " They 've got a wartime soap ' too , " Pug said . " Einheitsseife . When you get into a crowded German train it 's not much in evidence . " Roosevelt burst out laughing . " Germans are getting a bit ripe , eh ? I love that . Einheitssei f e1 " Pug told jokes circulating in Berlin . In line with the war effort speedup , the Fiihrer had announced that the period of pregnancy henceforth would be three months . Hitler and Goring , passing through conquered Poland , had stopped at a wayside shrine . Pointing to the crucified Christ , Hitler asked Goring whether he thought that would be their final fate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Goring said . " When we are through there will be no wood or iron left in Germany . " Roosevelt guffawed at the jokes and said that there were far worse ones circulating about himself . He asked animated questions about Hitler'smannerisms in the meeting at Karinhall . Mrs. Roosevelt interjected in a sharp serious tone , " Captain , do you think that Mr. Hitler is a madman ? " " Ma'am , he gave the clearest rundown on the history of central EuropeI 've ever heard . He did it off the cuff , just rambling along . You might think his version entirely cockeyed , but it all meshed together and ticked , like a watch . " " Or like a time bomb , " said the President . Pug smiled at the quick grim joke , and nodded . " This is an excellent martini , Mr. President . It sort of tastes like it is n't there . Just a cold cloud . " Roosevelt 's eyebrows went up in pride and delight . " You 've described the perfect martini ! Thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Mrs. Roosevelt . Roosevelt said , " Well , my dear , even the Republicans would agree that as a President , I 'm a good bartender . " It was n't much of a jape , but it was a presidential one , so Pug Henrylaughed . The drink , the cosiness of the room , the presence of the wife andthe dog , and the President 's naive pleasure in his trivial skill , made himfeel strangely at home . The little black dog was the homiest touch ; it satworshipping the crippled President with a bright stare , now and thenrunning a red tongue over its nose or shifting its look inquiringly to Pug . Sipping his martini , his pose in the wheelchair as relaxed as before ,  |p367but  the patrician tones subtly hardening for business , Roosevelt said , " Do you think the British will hold out , Pug , if the French collapse ? " " I do n't know much about the British , sir . " " Would you like to go there for a spell as a naval observer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back in Berlin ? " Hoping that Franklin Roosevelt was in as pleasant a mood as he seemed , Victor Henry took a plunge . " Mr. President , any chance of my not going back to Berlin ? " Roosevelt looked at the naval captain for an uncomfortable five or ten seconds , coughing hard . His face sobered into the tired gravity of the portraits that hung in post offices and naval stations . " You go back there , Pug . " " Aye aye , sir . " " I know you 're a seafaring man . You 'll get your sea command . " " Yes , Mr. President . " " I 'd be interested in your impressions of London . " " I 'll go to London , sir , if that 's your desire . " " How about another martini ? " " Thank you , sir , I 'm fine . " " There 's the whole question of helping the British , you see , Pug . " The President rattled the frosty shaker and poured . " No sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to end up using them against us . " Mrs. Roosevelt said with a silvery ring in her voice , " Franklin , you know you 're going to help the British . " The President grinned and stroked the Scottie 's head . Over his face came the look of complacent , devilish slyness with which he had suggested buying the Allied ocean liners  --  eyebrows raised , eyes looking sidewise at Pug , mouth corners pulled far up . " Captain Henry here does n't know it yet , but he 's going to be in charge of getting rid of those old , useless , surplusNavy dive bombers . We badly need a housecleaning there ! No sense having a lot of extra planes cluttering up our training stations . Eh , Captain ? Very untidy . Not shipshape . " " Is that definite at last ? How wonderful , " said Mrs. Roosevelt . " Yes . Naturally the aviators did n't want a black shoe ' to handle it . " Roosevelt used the slang with self-conscious pleasure . " So naturally I picked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to part with planes . Pug will pry the machines loose . Of course it may be the end of me if word gets out . T Twill solve the third-term question ! Eh ? What 's your guess on that one , Pug ? Is that man in the White House going to break George Washington 's rule and try for a third term ? Everybody seems to know the answer but me . " Victor Henry said , " Sir , what I know is that for the next four years this country is going to need a strong Commander-in-Chief . " Roosevelt 's mobile pink face turned grave and tired again , and he coughed , glancing at his wife . He pressed a buzzer . " Somebody the people are n't bored with , Pug . A politician exhausts his welcome after a while . Like an actor who 's been on too long . The good will ebbs away and he loses his audience . " A Navy lieutenant in dress blues with gold shoulder loops appeared in the doorway . Roosevelt offered his hand to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to anything , Pug , but our conscience is clear . We made the effort . You were very helpful . " " Aye aye , sir . " " Welles was n't as impressed with Hitler as you evidently were . " " Sir , he 's more used to being around great men . " A peculiar flash , not wholly pleasant , came and went in the President'stired eyes . " Good-bye , Pug . " A crashing thunderstorm , with thick rain hissing down from skies black as night , stopped Victor Henry from leaving the White House . He waited for a letup in a crowded open doorway marked PRESS , where a cool damp wind brought in a smell of rainy grass and flowers . All at once a heavy hand thwacked his shoulder . " I say , Henry , you 've got yourself another stripe ! " Alistair Tudsbury , swelling in green gabardine , leaning on a cane , his moustached face purpler than before around the nose and on the cheeks , beamed down at him through thick glasses . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't you in Berlin , old cock ? And how 's that magnificent wife of yours ? " As he spoke , a small black British car pulled up to the entrance in the streaming rain and honked . " That 's Pamela . What are you doing now ? Why not come along with us ? There 's a little reception at the British embassy , just cocktails and such . You 'll meet some chaps you ought to know . " " I have n't been asked . " " You just have been . What 's the matter , do n't you like Pam ? There she sits . Come along now . " Tudsbury propelled Henry by the elbow out into the rain . " Of course I like Pamela , " Henry managed to say ' as the father opened the car door and thrust him in.  | " Pam , look whom I bagged outside the press room ! " " Why , how wonderful . " She took a hand off the wheel and clasped Pug 's , smiling familiarly as though not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diamond sparkled on her left hand , which before had been bare of rings . " Tell me about your family , " she said as she drove out of the White House grounds , raising her voice over the slap of the wipers and the drumming of the rain . " Is your wife well ? And what happened to that boy of yours who was caught in Poland ? Is he safe ? " " My wife 's fine , and so 's Byron . Did I mention to you the name of the girl he travelled with to Poland ? " " I do n't believe you did . " " It 's Natalie Jastrow . " " Natalie ! Natalie Jastrow ? Really ? " " Knows you , she says . " Pamela gave Henry a quizzical little glance . " Oh , yes . She was visitinga chap in your embassy in Warsaw , I should think . Leslie Slote . " " Exactly . She went to see this fellow Slote . Now she and my son intend to get married . Or so they say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Natalie 's quite a girl , " said Pamela , looking straight ahead . " How do you mean that ? " " I mean she 's extraordinary . Intelligence , looks . " Pamela paused . " Willpower . " " A handful , you mean , " Pug said , remembering that Tudsbury had used the word to describe Pamela . " She 's lovely , actually . And ten times more organized than I 'll ever be . " " Leslie Slote 's coming to this party , " Tudsbury said . " I know , " Pamela said . " Phil Rule told me . " The conversation died there , in a sudden cold quiet . When the traffic halted at the next red light , Pamela shyly reached out two fingers to touch the shoulder board of Henry 's white uniform . " What does one call you now ? Commodore ? " " Captain , captain , " boomed Tudsbury from the rear seat . ' FourAmerican stripes . Anybody knows that . And mind your protocol . This man 's becoming the Colonel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Pug said . " An embassy papershuffler , you mean . The lowestform of animal life . Or vegetable , more exactly . " Pamela drove skillfully through the swarming traffic of Connecticut and Massachusetts Avenues . As they came to the embassy , the rain was dwindling . Late sunlight shafted under the black clouds , lighting up the pink banks of blooming rhododendron , the line of wet automobiles , and the stream of guests mounting the steps . Pamela 's streaking arrival and skidding halt drew glares from several Washington policemen , but nothing more . ' Well , well , sunshine after the storm , " said Tudsbury . " A good omen for poor old England , eh ? What 's the news , Henry ? Did you hear anythingspecial at the White House ? Jerry is really riding hell for leather to the sea , is n't he ? The teletype says he 's knocked the French Ninth Army apart . I do think he 's going to cut the Allied line right in two . I told you in Berlin that the French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be counterattacking around Soissons , " Pug said . Tudsbury made a skeptical face . As they went inside and fell into the long reception line extending up a majestic stairway , he said , " The bizarre thing to me is the lack of noise over Germany 's invasion of Belgium and Holland . The world just yawns . This shows how far we 've regressed in twenty-five years . Why , in the last war the rape of Belgium was an earth-shaking outrage . One now starts by assuming total infamy and barbarityin the Germans . That gives them quite an edge , you know . Our side does n't have that freedom of action in the least . " At the head of the wide red-carpeted stairs , the guest of honor , a skinny , ruddy man of fifty or so , in a perfectly cut double-breasted black suit with huge lapels , stood with the ambassador , shaking people 's hands under a large painting of the King and Queen , and now and then nervously touching his wavy blond hair . " How are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Lord Burne-Wilke , Captain Victor Henry , " Tudsbury said . Pamela walked on , disappearing into the crowd . Duncan Burne-Wilke offered Pug a delicate-looking but hard hand , smoothing his hair with the other . " Burne-Wilke is here to try to scare up any old useless aeroplanes you happen to have lying around , " said Tudsbury . " Yes , best prices offered , " said the ruddy man , briefly smiling at the American , then shaking hands with somebody else . Tudsbury limped with Pug through two large smoky reception rooms , introducing him to many people . In the second room , couples shuffled in a corner to the thin music of three musicians . The women at the party were elegantly clad , some were beautiful ; men and women alike appeared merry . It struck Victor Henry as an incongruous scene , considering the war news . He said so to Tudsbury . " Ah well , Henry , pulling long faces wo n't kill any Germans , you know . Making friends with the Americans may . Where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've been on my feet for hours . "  |p371They  came upon Pamela drinking at a large round table with Leslie Slote and Natalie Jastrow . Natalie wore the same black suit ; so far as Pug knew she had come to Washington in the clothes she stood up in , with no luggage but a blue leather sack . She gave him a haggard smile , saying , " Small world . " Pamela said to her father , " Governor , this is Natalie Jastrow . The girl who went tootling around Poland with Captain Henry 's son . " Slote said , rising and shaking hands with Tudsbury , " Talky , you may be the man to settle the argument . What do you think the chances are that Italy will jump into the war now ? " " It 's too soon . Mussolini will wait until France has all but stopped twitching . Why do you ask ? " Natalie said , " I 've got an old uncle in Siena , and somebody should go and fetch him out . There 's nobody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Slote said , " And I tell you , Aaron Jastrow 's quite capable of getting Himself out . " " Aaron Jastrow ? " said Tudsbury with an inquisitive lilt . " A Jew 's Jesus ? Is he your uncle ? What 's the story ? " " Will you dance with me ? " Pamela said to Pug , jumping up . " Why , sure . " Knowing how much she disliked dancing , he was puzzled , but he took her hand and they made their way through the jam toward the musicians . She said as he took her in his arms , " Thanks . Phil Rule was coming to the table . I 've had enough of him . " " Who is Phil Rule ? " " Oh  --  he was the man in my life for a long time . Far too long . I met him in Paris . He was rooming with Leslie Slote . He 'd been at Oxford when Leslie was a Rhodes Scholar . Phil 's a correspondent , and an excellentone , but a monster . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Really ? Slote 's the brainy quiet type , I thought . " Pamela 's thin lips twisted in a smile . " Do n't you know they can be the worst ? They have pressure-cooker souls , those fellows . " They danced In silence for a while ; she was as clumsy as ever . She spoke up cheerily . " I 'm engaged to be married . " " I noticed your ring . " " Well , it was a good job I did n't wait for that Navy flier son of yours , was n't it ? " " You did n't give me any encouragement , or I might have worked on it . " Pamela laughed . " Fat lot of difference that would have made . And Natalie really has your other boy , has she ? Well , that 's the end of the availableHenrys , then . I made my move in good time . "  | " Who is he , Pamela ? " " Let 's see . Ted 's rather hard to describe . Teddy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nice-looking and rather a lamb , and a bit mad . He 's an actor , but he had n't got too far when he joined the RAF . He 's only twenty-eight . That makes him fairly ancient for flying . He 's in France with a Hurricane squadron . " After another silence Pug said , " I thought you did n't like to dance . Especially with Americans . " " I do n't . But you 're so easy to dance with and so tolerant . The young ones are now doing an insane thing called the shag . One or two have got hold of me and fairly shagged my teeth loose . " " Well , my style is straight 1914 . " " Possibly that was my year . Or should have been . Oh dear , " she said , as the music changed tempo and some of the younger couples began hoppingup and down , " here 's a shag now . " They walked off the dance floor to a purple plush settee in the foyer , where they sat under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a cigarette and took several puffs , leaning an elbow on her knee . Her low-cut dress of rust-colored lace partly showed a small smooth white bosom ; her hair , which on the Bremen had been pulled back in a thick bun , hung to her shoulders now in glossy brown waves . " I have a yen to go home and enlist in the WAAFs . " He said nothing . She cocked her head sideways . " What do you think ? " " Me ? I approve . " " Really ? It 's rank disloyalty , is n't it ? Talky 's doing a vital service to England here . " " He can get another secretary . Your lucky RAF man is there . " She colored at the word lucky . " It 's not that simple . Talky 's eyes do get tired . He likes to dictate and to have things read to him . He keeps weird hours , works in the bathtub , and so forth . " " Then he 'll have to indulge his eccentricities a bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abandon him ? " " He 's your father , Pamela , not your son . " Pamela 's eyes glistened at him . ' Well , if I actually do it , we shall have Tudsbury in Lear , for a week or two . How sharper than a serpent 's tooth it is , to have a thankless child ! '  --  I think the governor will rather enjoy throwing himself into the part , at that . Perhaps we should return to him now , Captain Henry . " He said as they stood and walked to the main reception room , ' Why not call me Pug , by the way ? Everybody does who knows me . " " Yes , I heard your wife call you that . What does it mean ? " " Well , at the Naval Academy , anybody named Henry usually getsp373called Patrick , the way a Rhodes gets labelled Dusty . But there was a Patrick ' Henry in the class above me , and I was a freshman boxer , so I got tagged Pug . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and arms . " Do you still ? " He grinned . " Kind of strenuous . Tennis is my game , when I can get around to it . " " Oh ? I play fair tennis . " ' Well , good . If I ever get to London , maybe we can have a game . " " Are you  --  " She hesitated . " Is there any chance of your coming to London ? " " It 's not impossible . There they are , way down there , " Pug said . " Gosh , this room 's mobbed . " " Natalie seems miserable , " Pamela said . Pug said , " She just lost her father . " " Oh ? I did n't know that . Well , she 's grown more attractive , that 's sure . Definitely marrying your boy , is she ? " " It seems so . Maybe you can give me advice on that one . I feel she 's too old for him , too smart for him , and just about everything else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about each other . Which is something , hut not everything . " " Maybe it wo n't come off . There 's many a slip , " Pamela said . " You never have met Byron . You 'd see in a minute what I mean , if you did . He 's really still a baby . " She mischievously glanced at him and tapped his arm . " You do sound fatherly at that . " Tudsbury and Slote were in a lusty argument , with Natalie looking sombrely from one to the other . " I 'm not talking about anything he owes England . That 's beside the point , " Tudsbury said , striking his empty glass on the table . " It 's his responsibility to the American people as their leader to ring the alarm and get them cracking , if they 're to save their own hides . " " What about the Chicago quarantine speech ? " Slote said . " That was over two years ago , and he 's still trying to live down the warmonger charges . A leader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sight . The people still have n't gotten over their disgust with the First World War . Now here 's another one , brought on by stupid French and British policy . It 's not the time for singing Over There , ' Talky . It just wo n't work . " " And while Roosevelt watches his timing , " said Tudsbury , " Hitler will take half the world . Pamela , be a love and get me another drink . My leg 's killing me . " " All right . " Pamela docilely walked to the bar.  |p374Tudsbury  turned to Henry , " You know the Nazis . Can Roosevelt afford to wait ? " " What choice has he ? A few months ago Congress was fighting him just on selling you guns . " " A few months ago , " Tudsbury said , " Hitler was n't overrunning Belgium , Holland , and France , and directly facing you across the water . " " Lot of water , " said Pug . Slote slowly beat two fingers with one , like a professor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The old regimes are simply not competent for the industrialage . They 're dead scripts , molted skins . Europe 's made a start on replacing them by a lot of wholesale murder  --  the usual European approach to problems , and that 's all the First World War was about  --  and then by resorting to tyrannies of the left or the right . France has simply stagnated and rotted . England 's played its same old upper-crust butterfly comedy , while soothing the workers with gin and the dole . Meantime Roosevelt has absorbed the world revolt into legislation . He has made America the only viable modern free country . It was a stupendous achievement , a peaceful revolution that 's gutted Mandan theory . Nobody wholly grasps that yet . They 'll be writing books about it in the year 2000 . Because of it , America 's the power reserve of free mankind . Roosevelt knows that and moves slowly . It 's the last reserve available , the last best hope . " Tudsbury was screwing all his heavy features into a mask of disagreement . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , none of the New Deal issued from this great revolutionary 's brain . The ideas flooded into Washington with the new people when the administration changed . They were quite derivative ideas , mostly copied from us decadent butterflies . We were a good deal ahead of you in social legislation .  --  Ah , thank you , Pam .  --  Now this slow moving can be good politics , but in war it 's a tactic of disaster . Fighting Germany one at a time , we 'll just go down one at a time . Which would be a rather silly end to the English-speaking peoples . " " We have theatre tickets . Come and have dinner with us , " Slote said , standing and stretching out a hand to Natalie , who rose too . " We 're going to L'Escargot . " " Thank you . We 're dining with Lord Burne-Wilke . And hoping to inveigle Pug Henry into joining us . " S lote bought Natalie as luxurious a dinner as Washington offered , with champagne ; took her to a musical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his apartment , hoping for the best . In a commonp375enough masculine way , he thought that if all went well he could win her hack in one night . She had once been his slave ; how could such a feeling disappear ? At first she had seemed just another conquest . He had long planned a prudent marriage in his thirties to some girl of a rich or wellconnectedfamily , after he had had his fun . Natalie Jastrow now put him in a fever that burned up all prudent calculations . Leslie Slote had never wanted anything in his life as he wanted Natalie Jastrow . Her distracted lean look of the moment was peculiarly enticing . He was quite willing to marry her , or do anything else , to have her again . He opened his apartment door and snapped on lights . " Ye gods , a quarter to one . Long show . How about a drink ? " " I do n't know . If I 'm to search around tomorrow in New York courthousesfor Aaron 's documents , I 'd better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter again , Natalie . You mix us a couple of shorties . " " All right . " Removing his shoes , jacket , and tie , Slote sank in an armchair , donned black-rimmed glasses , and studied the letter . He took one book after another from the wall  --  heavy green government tomes  --  and drank , and read . The ice in both drinks tinkled in the silence . " Come here , " he said . Natalie sat on the arm of the couch , under the light . Slote showed her , in a book , State Department rules for naturalized citizens living abroad more than five years . They forfeited citizenship , but the book listed seven exceptions . Some seemed to fit Aaron Jastrow 's case  --  as when health was a reason for staying abroad , or when a man past sixty and retiredhad maintained his ties with the United States . " Aaron 's in hot water on two counts , " Slote said . " There 's this joker about his father 's naturalization . If Aaron actually was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week or a day , he is n't an American , technically , and never has been one . But even if he was , he has the five-year problem . I mentioned this to him once , you know . I said he should go back to the United States and stay a few months . I 'd just seen too many passport messes crop up on this point , ever since the Nazis took over Germany . " Slote picked up the glasses , went to his kitchenette , and mixed more drinks , continuing to talk . " Aaron 's been a fool . But he 's far from unique . It 's unbelievable how careless and stupid Americans can be about citizenship . In Warsaw a dozen of these foul-ups turned up every week . The best thing now  --  by far  --  is to get the Secretary of State to drop a word to Rome . The day that word arrives Aaron will be in the clear . " Padding to the couch in his stocking feet , he handed her a drink and sat beside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however small , through channels scares me . There 's a monumental jam of cases from Europe . It could take Aaron eighteen months . I therefore do n't think there 's much point in your digging around in Bronx courthouses for his alien registrationand his father 's naturalization records . Not yet . After all , Aaron 's a distinguished man of letters . I 'm hoping the Secretary will shake his head in amusement at the folly of absent-minded professors , and shoot off a letter to Rome . I 'll get on this first thing in the morning . He 's a thorough gentleman . It ought to work . " Natalie stared at him . He said , " What 's the matter ? " " Oh , nothing . " The girl drank off half her drink , all at once . " It certainlyhelps to know a man who knows a man , does n't it ? Well ! If I 'm to hang around Washington till the end of the week , we 'll have to get me a hotel room , Leslie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tonight . I feel damned odd even about that . Maybe I can still try a few of the ho-tels . " " Go ahead . I was on the phone for an hour . Washington in May is impossible . There are four conventions in town . " " If Byron finds out , God help me . " ' Wo n't he believe that I slept on the couch ? " " He 'll have to , if he finds out . Leslie , will you get me permission to go to Italy ? " He compressed his mouth and shook his head . " I told you , the Department'sadvising Americans to leave Italy . " " If I do n't go , Aaron wo n't come home . " ' Why ? A broken ankle is n't disabling . " " He just will never pull himself together and leave . You know that . He 'll dawdle and potter and hope for the best . " Slote said with a shrug , " I do n't think you want to go there to help Aaron . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Running away , because you 're in way over your head with your submarine boy , and shatteredby losing your father , and actually do n't know what on earth to do next with yourself . " " Are n't you clever ! " Natalie clinked the half-full glass down on the table . " I leave in the morning , Slote , if I have to stay at the YWCA . But I 'll make your breakfast first . Do you still eat your eggs turned over and fried to leather ? " " I 've changed very little , altogether , darling . " " Good-night . " She closed the bedroom door hard.  |p377Half  an hour later Slote , dressed in pajamas and a robe , tapped at the door . " Yes ? " Natalie 's voice was not unfriendly . " Open up . " Her faintly smiling face was pink and oily , and over a nightgown she had bought that afternoon she wore a floppy blue robe of his . " Hi . Something on your mind ? " " Care for a nightcap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I 'm wide awake . " Humming happily , Leslie Slote went to the kitchen and emerged almostimmediately with two very dark highballs . Natalie sat on the couch , arms folded , face shiny in the lamplight . " Thanks . Sit down , Leslie . Stop pacing . That was a mean crack about Byron . " " Was n't it the truth , Natalie ? " " All right . If we 're playing the truth game , is n't it simpler today than it was a year ago for a Foreign Service officer to have a Jewish wife , since the Nazis are now beyond the pale ? " Slote 's cheery look faded abruptly . " That never once occurred to me . " " It did n't have to occur to you . Now listen , dear . You can feed me stiff highballs , and play This Ca n't Be Love ' on the phonograph , and all that , but do you really want me to invite you into the bedroom ? Honestly , it would be a sluttish thing to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in love with somebody else . " He sighed and shook his head . " You 're too damned explicit , Natalie . You always have been . It 's coarse , in a girl . " " You said that the first time I proposed , sweetie . " Natalie stood , sippingher highball . " My goodness , what a rich drink . I do believe you 're nothing but a wolf . " She was scanning the books . " What can I read ? Ah , Graham Wallas . The very man . I 'll be asleep in half an hour . " He stood and took her by the shoulders . " I love you , I 'll love you forever , and I 'll try every way I can to get you back . " " Fair enough . Leslie , I must go to Italy to get Aaron out . Honestly ! I feel horrible about my father . He was worrying over Aaron the very ( lay he died . Maybe this is irrational expiation , but I 've got to bring Aaron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it 's arrangeable . " " Now you 're talking . Thanks . Good-night . " She kissed him lightly , d went to the bedroom , and closed the door . He did not rap again , though he read for a long time and had more drinks.
