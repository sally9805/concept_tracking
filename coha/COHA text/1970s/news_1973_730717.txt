txt IN TEE GOLDEN AGE of American railroading over a century ago , when staunch men drove twin bands of steel across a continent to link two oceans , grand deeds were done against insurmountable odds . Three strokes of the sledge to the spike , 10 spikes to the rail , 400 rails to the mile , the railroad builders plied their craft thru blizzards and rainstorms , across mountains , great plains , and forests , bridging gorges , spanning raging rivers , and enduring searing desert heat that turned a man 's skin so black it was hard to distinguish an Irishman from a Chinese or a red man from a white . Those were the days of great heart and muscle , of determination and total disregard of personal suffering , days when men labored from dawn to dusk to fashion the great work of an age ? the continental railway system of the United States , **25;748;TOOLONG ....... 0 .... , a monument to human courage and ingenuity that endures to this day . Well , the golden spike that finally linked a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is now a memory dimmed by the passage of 104 years . But the kind of spirit that made such an achievement possible  --  the driving need of men to carve out their own destinies and that of their homeland , whatever the obstacles ? . lives on in a nation that many claim has gone soft with the material benefits of a century of technological progress . THIS SEPTEMBER , a band of young Americans  --  ranging in age from 22 to 27 ? will stage a grand and glorious contest of determination , courage . and physical endurance worthy of the pioneer railroaders . This will be their great adventure , a race against time and the elements across the breadth of the United States on muscle-powered .11 ..... mslallwea ...... 2.04.4110 ? 1111MIIR  --  MmeftleMM railroad handcars-70 pumps to the minute , 35 pounds of pressure to the pump , eight hours a day , seven days a week until 3,100 miles have rolled beneath their wheels 2% months later . One team of three young men will depart San Francisco bound for the East Coast via Salt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Cincinnati , Roanoke , and Norfolk , Va . A second crew will follow a reverse course , climbing the Blue Ridge and Appalachians. , spanning the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers , then roiling across the Great Plains in the soft haze of autumn to labor their way over the Rockies , the Uinta and Wasatch ranges of Utah , and finally the deserts of the Far West before crossing the Sierra Nevada into the lush forests of Northern California . " It will he a great way to see the country , " says Charles Trainer of Cottage Grove , Wis. , a 27-year-old political science graduate of Cornell who is now a part-time teacher at the University of Wisconsin in Madison , 10 miles from his home . " EACH OF US HAS his own personal reason for wanting to make this journey . But in the end , if we can get enough publicity , perhaps we can convince the American people that there 's a grand view of their nation to be had from the vantage point of the railroad tracks . " Each of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man selected from volunteers they hope to acquire along the way for three-day , 100-to-150-mile segments . Each of the relief volunteers will furnish fresh muscle . So will the Marconi-rigged sails attached to 14-foot masts on the two , 400-pound handcars based on designs of 40 years ago , but equipped with modern disk brakes and built of lightweight aluminum . The teams will pump by day and camp out under canvas at night . They 'll buy groceries along the way , traversing the rights of way of four railroads from which they already have obtained permission for use of 90 per cent of the trackage required . Leaving San Francisco with ' Trainer will be 24-year-old Bill Russell , sales manager of a foul weather gear maniacturer in Westport , Conn. , whose wares will come in handy on the trip , and Will Holbrook , a 25-year-old Milwaukee high school teacher now at the American School in Lugano , Switzerland . The Eastern contingent  --  all Boston University students ? will be led by Graham Claytor , who is the nephew of a Norfolk &; Western Railway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Southern Railway . THE CREWS HAVE A $500 bet riding on the outcome of the race , altho Trainer concedes the prevailing west to east winds will favor his sail , which can double as shelter against inclement weather . The young men hope each railroad will furnish a radio equipped motor rail car to precede them so they wo n't unexpected , encounter a speeding freight train in some distant tunnel or mountain pass in true Laurel and Hardy style . They also hope some sponsor will help defray the expense of each of the expeditions . Heck . They 've even willing to emblazon the name of his product on their sails if he 'll go along with the project , But if no financial angel steps forward , they 'll go it alone . Thruout history , men have scaled mountains , explored Jungles , and even gone to the moon in the endless quest to find what lies within themselves . In much the same manner , this is what these young men seek to discover . " I want to be able to look back on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unique , something no one had ever done before , " explains Trainer . It was this spirit that spurred on the men who finally rested their picks and shovels at Promontory , Utah , on that historic day in 1869 . It is to this nation 's benefit that the same spirit still flourishes today in the young America of a century later .
