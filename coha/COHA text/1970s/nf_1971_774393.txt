txt  | Georgia , when the center people were still going over to Florida to make their observations . " He was a young animal named Bandam , a recent arrival , " said Dr. Guilloud . " We could see that he did n't feel well , so we took his temperature , and it was very high . What with one thing and another , I thought he might have polio , but there was n't any case on record of anthropoids getting the thing , and I could n't be sure . We isolated him just the same , and I contacted an experienced pediatrician in Jacksonville who knows a lot about polio , and he was willing to have a look at samples , so I sent them off and waited ? those tests take quite a while . " Finally he called me up and diagnosed it ; it was the real thing , all right . In any case after ten days there could n't be any doubt about it because Bandam showed a perfectly typical paralysis . He survived . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd treat a child with polio ? he gets massage every day , and therapy , and he moves around in a little walker : he manages it very well . " But it was n't all so happy an ending . It was in July he came down with it , and as I said , we isolated him right away , but he 'd already handed it on . In September one of our orangs came down with polio , and so did another young gorilla which died . Now we immunize all the great apes with regular vaccine . Fortunately monkeys seem to be naturally immune ? we have n't had to worry about them . " The tour resumed . I was permitted to don a laboratory coat and sit on a high stool in the apes ' playroom in the nursery , where I watched a number of little chimpanzees first as they romped around , and then a contingent of small gorillas . They wrestled , raced , pulled toys back and forth , and now and then in passing gave me a friendly slap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to look at an expectant chimpanzee mother . She stared straight past us as if we did not exist : she had more important matters on her mind . " We keep a close eye on her , " said Dr. Guilloud . " She 's pretty old to be giving birth , not that age seems to worry chimps in these matters . As far as we know they do n't go through menopause . We 're not sure if any of the infrahuman primates do , but we 'd like to be sure . " ( Since then , however , Dr. Gertrude van Wagenen has published the results of a study made on rhesus females , which indicates that these monkeys do indeed pass through something similar to menopause . ) Dr. Guilloud added , " You know we still have one of Dr. Yerkes ' original chimps Wendy . " I was astonished . Wendy ? I had read of her , of course ; she was at quired in the very early days , along with a young male named Pan . I he names themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alive and well on Ararat.  | " Yes , she 's about forty-six , " said Dr. Guilloud . " Of course , we ca n't be absolutely sure , since Dr. Yerkes himself did n't know exactly how old she was when he got her , but she ca n't be far off forty-six . She probably represents some kind of longevity record . " Accompanied by the now familiar jingling of keys , we passed through several doors and arrived out in the open ? if one can call it that ? far to the rear of the building , at one end of a long covered walk that led past one high , roomy cage after another . All down the line , with a soft , scurrying rustle , apes hurried to the front bars of their compartments to see who was coming and to watch us walk past . They sat on crossbars or stood clutching the bars that made up their front walls , pressing their noses between , staring . They obviously knew Dr. Guilloud , but were curious about me , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I suppose their silence put me off . Once in prewar England I was taken to a tea party in South Kensington where nobody had ever seen a real live American before , and they all sat and stared at me in the same way . I still remember it sometimes in dreams , and wake up sweating , but things proved to be a little better than that among Yerkes ' great apes . Dr. Guilloud took my arm , about halfway along , and propelled me toward the outside of the walk , away from the cage fronts , saying , " You 'd better stay as far off as you can . Some of the chimps spit , and they have a good aim . Those two ahead are the worst . " One of the two he indicated waited until we were nearly out of reach before he let fly . The other did n't even try , but farther along , as we passed a smaller chimpanzee , the animal spat at Dr. Guilloud , who stopped short and regarded him in surprise . " Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said in hurt tones , and then , suddenly , he spat back . Outside an orang-utan 's cage he paused and said , " We 're really proud of this girl . " She was a huge reddish-orange animal whose eyes as she crouched comfortably on the floor were almost level with ours . A lively little orang climbed over and around her bulk as if she really were the mountain she resembled , while the mother 's intelligent red-brown eyes remained fixed on Dr. Guilloud 's . " We had to do a Caesarian to save her life , " he said . " There was some risk for the baby , and it would have been a crime to lose him , but everything turned out fine . How 's the boy , Bessie ? " Gently he scratched her chest through the widely spaced bars . " He looks fine , " he continued . " Does you credit . . . . You see we let them rear their own children if they do n't reject them , and this one 's a good mother . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and clambered up to a point above our heads , from where he blinked down at us . Dr. Guilloud  | had stopped scratching Bessie and was moving away when , with what looked like slow motion but could n't have been , she grasped his hand and held on to it . She did n't do anything else , merely sat with her fingers wrapped around his , eyes fixed on his face . She was as immobile , as impassive , as impressive as any Englishwoman at a South Kensington tea party . Mildly Dr. Guilloud said , " Let go , Bessie , that 's the girl . " Bessie did not let go . She did n't do anything else either . I , too , did nothing : I just stood there . I felt that if Dr. Guilloud wanted me to do anything such as call out the guard , he would say so . " Come on , Bessie , " he said in even tones . " I ca n't stay here all day , you know that . I have other things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " When there was no reaction to this , he lifted his other hand ? slowly ? and began working at one of her fingers , uncurling it from its grasp . He talked as he worked , like a loquacious oyster opener : " That 's the girl . That 's it . That 's the girl . A joke 's a joke , is n't it , Bessie ? " She did not resist , but she did n't help either . Now he had that finger prised up , and it hovered where he left it , like a forgotten sausage in a spaceship . Dr. Guilloud calmly set to work on the next finger , forcing it up while Bessie continued to stare into his eyes . Having uncurled that one , he started on the third , which was also the last she was using . It seemed to let go more easily , and then he was free . He stepped back slowly , out of reach . " Good girl , Bessie , " said Dr. Guilloud . I asked urgently , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shook his head . His words when they came were muffled . " Perfectly all right , " he said cheerfully . Bessie watched us go without comment or movement . The baby jumped to her back again and peered at us over her hairy shoulder .  | A year later , when I revisited Yerkes , I was sorry to find that Dr. Guilloud had moved to the state university at Athens . There were other changes on the staff , too , for things never stand still among laboratory men . Dr. Bryan Robinson , for instance , had gone back into private practice ; his work at the center was now being done by Dr. Adrian Perachio , working on behavioral problems . " Though I 'm really a neurophysiologist , " he said . " Robinson 's program , which he published a paper about , concentrated on remote control of the brain , or rather , the stimulation of certain areas of the brain , and so does ours . He worked on agonistic , or combative , and sexual behavior in the rhesus monkey : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Jose Delgado at Yale . Well , one of the things that 's been found out is that stimulation in the right area affects whatever quality it is ? I do n't know that we have a word for it ? that leads a monkey to dominate his group . " " Leadership ? " I suggested . " Possibly . This dominance can be adversely affected by stimulation : that is , an animal that was dominant may become subservient when stimulated , and it 's interesting to note that even after the stimulation ceases the animal may remain in that condition . The opposite effect can also be obtained : an animal that is usually humble ? ' naturally ' humble , you might say ? may become dominant and remain so .  | " We have also discovered that stimulation can cause sexual behavior , or rather step it up , but then , after a period of time , say a week , on cessation of the stimulation , the sex behavior is suppressed , as if the animal were exhausted . " We also work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biogenic amines . Certain substances are enzyme inhibitors that modify the metabolism of the amino acids . Treatment with these inhibitors has disruptive effects on sleep patterns and eating ; it also seems to change sex behavior . One of these substances is being used in hospitals as a special drug against cancer , for the following reason : it is known that some carcinoid tumors secrete a particular amine , and they figured that if the secretion were to be stopped the cancerous growth should cease . It does work like that , but there are side effects ? you may have read reports of them . Use of the drug alters the patient 's behavior , and there have been stories in the newspapers of how the patient becomes sexually stimulated . " " I thought that was another drug , " I interrupted . " Something used for Parkinson 's ? L-dopa ? " He nodded . " Yes , that one has been reported to have similar side ef- . fects . Well , it was observed in the laboratory that the drug I spoke of evidently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided to try it out on primates , too : the areas we stimulate are rich in this enzyme , and we ' felt justified in using the inhibitor . After all , you want as many handles as you can get . Well , what we discovered is interesting . The drug does not bring on hypersexuality in terms of the end point of sexual behavior . It increases mounting behavior and prolongs the time of intercourse but actually inhibits ejaculation . The published reports on the sexual effects of the drug on animals were in conflict with my data . To my mind , the real question is what its effects may be on the biochemistry and neural bases of the subject . We would like to find out . " Another set of investigations , Dr. Perachio said , was into the neural bases of the sleep-waking pattern , for which they were using three New World species of monkey , all in the same taxonomic family ? the squirrel monkey ( or saimiri ) , the cebus , and the owl monkey . " The owl monkey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " though there are various nocturnal prosimians of the bush-baby or galago type , primates lower on the family tree than monkeys . " They were studying the rapid eye movements that occur at certain stages of sleep , which evidently have some connection with the visual and auditory systems ; these systems themselves are connected . " Reflexes from the inner ear are connected with the eye muscular system , " he said . " Impulses move from the labyrinth of the inner ear to the eye muscles , and we 're trying to track down the relationship . "  | They would like to know , he said , to what extent this eye-ear activity is correlated with waking-sleeping states , and they were recording movements in order to correlate the dependence on , or independence of , these action systems with each other . " It 's a very complex problem . It 's funded by NASA , who want to know among other things what if any are the long-term effects of rotary movement and drastic alteration of sleep patterns such as the astronauts undergo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generally . Naturally they 're much concerned . After all , astronauts are in a chronically abnormal vestibular pattern . " He looked gloomy . " The men themselves , you know , are for the most part resistant to these studies , " he admitted . " Oh , well ? Do you remember that monkey Bonny who died after a space shot ? She was launched June 29 , 1969 , and they planned to leave her upstairs for thirty days , but they had to bring her down after only eight and a half days , and she died seven hours after landing . Remember the outcry caused by that affair ? But Bonny was the most instrumented organism that 's ever been put up . They collected more information from her flight and death than they 've had from any of the other space shots . The reasons for her death have n't been released , but they 're going to carry tremendous weight in future experiments . For myself , I think we ought to use more primates and not so many men . " Another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been augmented by the psychobiologist Duane Rumbaugh , formerly professor of psychology at San Diego State and now associate director at Yerkes . The director , Dr. Geoffrey Bourne , explained that Dr. Rumbaugh had been working at the San Diego zoos with nonhuman primates for some years ; and that he was especially interested in anthropoids . " He 's brought some gibbons with him , as a matter of fact , " said Dr. Bourne . As the English say , the penny dropped at that moment : I am an enthusiastic zoo visitor , and I recollected meeting Dr. Rumbaugh when he was giving intelligence tests to gibbons at the California zoo . Now Dr. Bourne and I ran him to earth in a laboratory , standing next to a mysterious machine like a big black box , a miniaturized version of the booth they used to use on TV for quiz shows , in which the contestants were supposed to go through agonies of thought before they gave their answers . Along the top of Dr. Rumbaugh 's booth ran a band of tiny windows , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but mechanical noises . Every so often this muted thump was accompanied by a light shining out of a little window . A white-coated girl sat by the box and took notes .  | " We have a gibbon in there , " explained Dr. Rumbaugh , " running through tests on a learning set . I started this work in 196o as a result of Harlow 's work at Wisconsin , and I 'm using his methods ? with certain adaptations . It 's hard to explain , but the gibbon in there is looking at a series of slides , pictures of objects in an irregular sequence of repetition . One certain picture is the right answer : every time she sees that one she is supposed to press a lever and get a reward ? something to eat . " I listened for the lever and watched the windows . Ping , light ; ping , light ; ping , no light ; ping , light ; . . . " She 's got it pretty well now , " he said with satisfaction . In 1949 Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American entitled " Learning to Think , " from which I quote certain passages : The speed and complexity of a human being 's mental processes , and the intricacy of the nerve mechanisms that presumably underlie them , suggest that the brain is not simply a passive network of communications but develops some kind of organization that facilitates learning and thinking . Whether such organizing principles exist has been a matter of considerable dispute . At one extreme , some modern psychologists deny that they do and describe learning as a mere trial-and-error process ? a blind fumbling about until a solution accidentally appears . At the other extreme , there are psychologists who hold that people learn through an innate insight that reveals relationships to them . The Harlows wrote that they were trying at Wisconsin to investigate these positions , and if possible to reconcile them , in a series of studies , some made with young children but most with monkeys . One of the first experiments was a simple discrimination test . The monkeys were confronted with a small board on which lay two objects different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picked up the correct object , it was rewarded by finding raisins or peanuts underneath . The position of the objects was shifted on the board in an irregular manner from trial to trial , and the trials were continued until the monkey learned to choose the correct object . The unusual feature of the experiment was that the test was repeated many times , with several hundred different pairs of objects . In other words , instead of training a monkey to solve a single problem , as had been done in most previous psychological work of this kind , we trained the animal on many problems , all of the same general type , but with varying kinds of objects . What happened as the monkeys became adept was extremely interesting . At first the animals learned by " the slow , laborious , fumble-and-find  | process , " but as a monkey got accustomed to the sort of problem facing it , it showed progressively greater efficiency . Eventually it showed " perfect insight " when faced with that particular kind of situation , and solved the problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the correct object the first time , it rarely made an error afterward . If it guessed wrong the first time ; it immediately shifted to the correct object , and subsequently responded almost perfectly . Thus the test appeared to demonstrate that trial-and-error and insight are but two different phases of one long continuous process . They are not different capacities , but merely represent the orderly development of a learning and thinking process . The Harlows ran a series of these " discrimination problems , " as they called them , on a group of nursery school children two to five years old , rewarding those who succeeded with bright beads rather than raisins or peanuts . They reacted as the monkeys did , making many errors at first and gradually learning to solve a problem in one trial . As a group , say the Harlows , they learned more rapidly than the monkeys , but they made the same types of errors , and the smartest monkeys learned faster than the dullest children . " We have called this process of progressive learning the formation of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The subject learns an organized set of habits that enables him to meet effectively each new problem of this particular kind . " They add that a single set provides only limited aid in enabling an animal to adapt to an ever-changing environment , but a host of different learning sets may supply the raw material for human thinking . Such sets were made by complicating the original test , reversing the reward value of the objects once , for instance , and then going back to the first method , or using three objects to choose between instead of two . In some cases , the monkey had to learn that it was not the shape of the object that was important , but its relation to the other two . One of the most striking findings from these tests was that once the monkeys have formed these learning sets , they retain them for long periods and can use them appropriately as the occasion demands . After a lapse of a year or more , a monkey regains top efficiency in a few minutes or hours of practice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks to master originally . Thinking over this evidence , the Harlows decided to re-examine the evidence offered to support the theory that animals possess some innate insight that has nothing to do with learning . This theory is based pri- marily on Wolfgang Kohler 's chimpanzees and his interpretation of their behavior regarding the sticks they used as tools , knocking down bananas with them , raking bananas ih , and so on . That the chimpanzees frequently solved these problems suddenly , as if by a flash of insight , impressed Kohler as evidence of an ability to reason independently of learning , " say the authors . " He even suggested that this ability might differentiate apes and men from other animals . " But Kohler 's observations had been made long ago , in the twenties , when the study of chimp psychology was all but unknown . All his animals had been captured in the forest , and , as the Harlows pointed out , he had no record of their previous learning . Nowadays , when we can watch chimps born under our eyes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people have tested young chimpanzees in this respect . The younger they are , the slower they prove in learning to use tools . None of them seem to solve their tasks at first with " sudden insight . " I had never heard how gibbons rate in these tests , and I asked Dr. Rumbaugh , " How do they do ? do they catch on quickly ? " He shook his head ? sadly , I thought . " They 're notoriously slow by the accepted methods of testing . Here , let me show you a graph that gives comparisons . This curve represents the work done by a chimpanzee , plotted with the coefficients of date and performance . You can see here , down in the corner , at the beginning of the series , that she was fumbling , and for several days the line stays on a level . Then suddenly ? see ? ? it turns up ; the curve goes on pretty regularly until she 's making practically perfect scores all the time . In other words , she 's caught on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is for rhesus , which follows the chimpanzee performance almost exactly . Sometimes rhesus are even quicker than chimps . But here , look at this record . " His finger traced a line that stayed close to the baseline , day after day . Even after it had lifted for a little , it slumped again . " And that , I am afraid , is for the gibbons , " said Dr. Rumbaugh . I was sorry about it . I am very fond of gibbons . I know they have n't the same sense of logic ? if one can call it that ? as chimpanzees or monkeys , but I have never for a moment thought them stupid . Clearly Dr. Rumbaugh agreed with me . " I 'm not satisfied that we 've been testing them properly , " he said . " We 've had the same sort of difficulty with squirrel monkeys , and I 've devised a new method that promises to give better results for both species . I reached the conclusion that their attention is distracted , during these tests , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go upstairs to see the ordinary apparatus that we use with chimps. "  | On the top floor , where a large number of apes were housed , a chimpanzee was being invited to play something very like the old thimble game . A young girl sat at an elaborate kind of table on wheels in front of the chimp 's cage . Erected on the table , at the cage side , was a framework through which , as through a window , she and the chimp regarded each other as long as the window was unshuttered . It could be shuttered , however , by a guillotine arrangement operated by the girl . With the window closed , she arranged two cups of different colors , placing each upside down with one covering a few raisins . Then up went the shutter , and the ape , reaching eagerly through the bars , took the cup off the raisins and grabbed them . The girl made a note on a pad , closed the window , and rearranged the game . During the whole time we watched , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the general idea , " said Dr. Rumbaugh , " but it does n't work with gibbons because they are so easily distracted by other things on the apparatus . Let 's go back to the office . " There he embarked on a description of the modifications he has put into a learning set formula devised at Wisconsin by Harlow , by adding something called Transfer Index . Later I read an article of his in which he advanced an interesting possibility : Gibbons and squirrel monkeys are highly arboreal , only rarely coming to the ground for other than very short intervals . Of the large apes , the orang-utan is the most arboreal , whereas the chimpanzee is intermediate in this regard , being somewhat less arboreal than the orang-utan but less terrestrial than the gorilla . A working hypothesis might be that associated with arborealness in primates is selection for readiness to attend to immediate foreground clues , which in the trees define routes of locomotion . This characteristic , which might complement life in the trees , could in formal test situations profoundly distract attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obscured by irrelevant clues , particularly of those planes which are more proximal to the eye than those which provide the reliable and relevant clues of the task . That they probably do differ in this regard makes comparative studies of primate learning , where widely disparate genera and/or age levels are studied , a particularly problematical endeavor if data are evaluated and interpreted via the traditional method of direct comparison . Back in the office , over coffee , glancing through a magazine connected with the center , I suddenly recognized a name . " Look here , " I said , with some excitement , " you never told me you 'd brought Gabrielle from San Diego with the other gibbons . Why , I knew Gabrielle when she was so high ? in the animal nursery at the zoo . She was an awfully nervous baby . How is she , anyway ? "  | Dr. Rumbaugh looked pleased . " You knew her , did you ? Yes , she was a neurotic little thing , but she 's grown up to be a beautiful animal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well . If you knew her , I think you might be interested in something I 've found out about her . " He proceeded to tell me . I ought to say , perhaps , that Gabrielle is a hybrid , the daughter of a lar and a Moloch gibbon . As an infant deprived of maternal company , she did what many such infants do , and became attached to a " security blanket , " or towel , that she took everywhere with her . From time to time , as the towel got dirty , it was taken out of her cage and replaced by a clean one . As time went on , Gabrielle clutched the cloth less persistently , but she seemed to want to keep it , nevertheless , so Dr. Rumbaugh let her go on with it . One day , removing a dirty towel from where she had left it draped over a perching bar , he noticed that it was sopping wet . This seemed a trifle odd , but he did n't give it much thought until the next time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Again it was very wet . The phenomenon was repeated every morning , until he decided to watch developments . At this point Dr. Rumbaugh broke off and said , " I think I 'd better . show you what we discovered . I took a moving picture of it , because I was sure nobody would believe my unsupported word . " A projector was rolled in , and the picture thrown on one of the office 's whitewashed walls . There we watched the cinematic Gabrielle , now a well-grown animal aged five years , busy at a task in her cage . She was carrying , or dragging , a towel , and as we watched , she leaped nimbly up to a sort of spigot or faucet that jutted out from a corner , not far from the crossbar on which she perched . " That 's a drinking fountain , " explained Dr. Rumbaugh . " Water runs as long as you press the button , and stops when you release it . " Gabrielle held the towel under the spout with one hand and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She 's soaking it until it drips , " said Gabrielle 's owner . I was already incredulous . I have known quite a few gibbons in my time , but I ca n't recollect any of them showing such efficiency and purpose . My incredulity mounted when Gabrielle took the towel , now as wet as a towel can be , and draped it over the crossbar . The camera moved downwards to where the water was dripping into a kind of hole or depression in the concrete beneath . " She lets it drip a while , " commented Dr. Rumbaugh . " And now look . " Gabrielle had descended and was lapping from the hole , now filled with water . I said , " 1 do n't believe it . "  | " Well , there it is , " said Dr. Rumbaugh . " It 's always said that gibbons are incapable of using tools , but here is Gabrielle using her own tool in a very elaborate way . Another thing ? she drank straight out of the little pool . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their fingers into the liquid and then suck it off the hairs . But that 's of secondary importance compared with the main fact that she has used a cloth as a means for transporting water . Also , she has come to use a rope to facilitate her swinging . " We stared at each other . " So I really think we need a new set of tools , " said Dr. Rumbaugh , and stowed his film away . Since my visit , I have heard that members of the three other anthropoid species ( assuming that gibbons belong in that class ) are now receiving the benefits of civilization through a highly modern medium . Dr. Bourne was worried by the fact that these intelligent animals tend to mope in captivity , especially when they are kept in isolation for various medical tests , as they must sometimes be at Yerkes . Without stimulation , the apes ' health suffers . Various symptoms of this boredom are summed up in the term " cage fatigue . " It occurred to Dr. Bourne that television might provide the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a newspaper interview . A public relations man for Sylvania ? a firm that makes TV sets ? picked up the item , and Sylvania offered ten sets to the center , which offer Dr. Bourne was happy to accept . The experiment has been a complete success . According to a local newspaper , one of the chimps , Dobbs , who had been the pet of a Santa Barbara woman before he came to Atlanta , was already a TV addict before he arrived . He shows a marked predeliction for Westerns . " Dobbs can even tell the bad guys from the good guys , " said Dr. Bourne to the reporter . " He associates the bad guy with violence , and sometimes he starts jumping up and down even before the heavy says anything rough . " Moreover , once when he had watched a non-Western picture in which two chimpanzee actors tore up the inside of a house , Dobbs did the same thing to his room . The apes are not allowed unlimited viewing . On most days they are given programs for only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then the goggle boxes are turned off . Even so , they are much happier nowadays . As Dr. Bourne said , " We feel that TV is a real contribution here . " Dr. Walter A. Pieper , another psychobiologist , was busy on a project that interests the Department of Justice very much ? the effects of marijuana on smokers . " It 's pretty relevant research , these days , " he said , " but we 're a long way from getting complete answers . The chimpanzee offers an excellent model , of course , but we ran into a snag right away : it seems that chimps do n't inhale . Yes , I know they can be taught to smoke ciga- rettes and cigars , but for the most part , they are n't really inhaling . I 'm trying to make this animal drag longer and longer . " We were back on the top floor , watching a large chimpanzee who had a sort of wheel attached to his cage . Around the edge of the wheel was a circle of little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing looked like an oversize pencil-sharpener . " What we want is for the smoke to come into contact with the respiratory mucosa , " said Dr. Pieper . ( A New York doctor later gave as his opinion that it was n't necessary to inhale marijuana to get an effect ; if it came into contact with mucosa in the mouth , that did it . ) " We have been trying to evaluate the animal 's efficiency when he 's smoked , " continued Dr. Pieper , " giving him these cigarettes in rotation : one day , he has regular cigarettes , the next day regular cigarettes plus marijuana distillate , and so forth . During one session he 'll have six cigarettes . We 've had one or two results that might mean something : for instance , on marijuana his efficiency ratio dropped , and next day on plain tobacco it came up again . Sometimes on marijuana the ratio drops from 85 to 4 percent which is pretty striking ? if it means anything , but we ca n't be sure as yet . Inci-. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But we do n't know what it all means yet . " He rubbed his forehead . " Of course , this work is n't focused exclhsively on marijuana . If all the marijuana in the world were suddenly to disappear , we could still use this method for studying emphysema and other lung disorders . " He brooded for a minute , then brightened up . " We 've got other problems , too , " he said , " for instance , alcoholism . It 's better understood than marijuana , but there is still a lot to find out , and for this we depend on Charlie . Charlie is five and a half months old now , and gets alcohol in each of his daily bottles of milk . He was drinking the equivalent of a quart of beverage alcohol a day , until he contracted pneumonia and we had to take him off it . He 's recovering , by the way . As far as we could tell , he had typical withdrawal symptoms : hyperreflexia , spastic rigidity , photophobia , sweaty palms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good clinical withdrawal symptoms . We 're also following the progress of this case with liver studies ? electron microscopic examination from a needle biopsy . The liver 's showing the beginning of changes , similar to what you 'd expect of a human alcoholic 's liver . This work 's funded in part by the National Center for the Prevention and Control of Alcoholism , which is part of the National Institute of Mental Health , but the center here provides the resource ? namely , Charlie . Charlie 's blood by evening shows that for every too milliliters of blood he has 200 to 300 milligrams of alcohol . Most states say that 150 milli- grams per too milliliters makes you too drunk to drive , you know . At his drunkest , Charlie just sleeps : we 'd say he 's passed out . It 's almost impossible to rouse him . Certainly he 's well above the point where he 's too drunk to drive . " However , we do n't want to depend on him alone , and we 're beginning observations on another chimpanzee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same schedule ultimately , but she 's still too small . You may know that there 's a growing body of evidence that to some extent at least the condition of alcoholism may be very closely related to biochemical changes in the central nervous system . It 's a very tentative theory so far , but it 's respected : these changes , even if they 're not the total cause of the condition , are a very important part of the origin of this ailment . Alcohol 's a pharmacologically active compound , and dependence on it may be established in a similar fashion to dependency on opiates . One way to test this idea is to see what happens to closely related species like ? well , like Charlie . " By the way , we made an unfortunate choice for a control animal when we picked Jama . You know what a control is , do n't you ? " " Well , " I began cautiously , " it would be a control animal , would n't it ? One that you do n't do anything to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assent , I asked with more assurance , " Who 's Jama ? " " Who 's Jama ? " he repeated , scandalized . " One of the most interesting chimps we 've ever had at Yerkes , that 's who . Or that was who : she 's dead now . She was born here , in July 1968 , and as I say , I planned to use her as a normal control animal , but pretty soon it became apparent that physically she was developing very slowly , just about half as fast as she should have . We did n't have any preconceived notions as to what was the matter with her , but obviously something was . For example , when she was seven months old she could n't sit up or move around , which is not at all normal . " Well , in March 1969 , one of our technicians in McClure 's laboratory ? he 's our veterinary pathologist ? was making routine chromosome studies of her blood cells , and she noticed something unusual about them . McClure looked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Jama had forty-nine chromosomes instead of the normal forty-eight . One of her doubled chromosomes , in other words , was n't really doubled ; it was triplicated , and that 's the same kind of structure you find in human mongoloids . There were some differences as to which chromosome was triplicated : in a human it would have been the twenty-first , whereas in Jama it was the twenty-second or twenty-third , but as the great apes have twenty-four pairs and humans have only twenty-three , that might account for it .  | " Assuming that Jama was a true mongoloid , it 's the first time anybody has spotted a mongoloid great ape . Of course , that does n't mean there have n't been others , only tha't nobody has ever recognized one before . That she died young is no wonder ; the postmortem showed a lot of things wrong with her , but she had a nice personality ? everybody who worked with her said she was nice , and mongoloids are usually gentle . It 's true that she did n't like to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But she had a nice personality . " " Jama ? " said Dr. Harold M. McClure . " Yes , she died at seventeen months ? she had three major cardiac defects which played an important role in her death . In addition , there was a weakened diaphragm with partial herniation and one lobe of the liver extending into the lower thoracic cavity . Both the parents are chromosomally normal . The mother had one previous pregnancy which was terminated by a spontaneous abortion , and since Jama 's birth she 's had another infant which seems chromosomally normal , but had a low birth weight . Jama 's parents were both young ? the mother was fifteen and the father twenty-two years old . " Another research project , started six months ago , entails raising infant chimpanzees and monkeys on unpasteurized milk from cows with leukemia . This milk has been shown to contain viruslike particles , although we do not know whether this is a leukemia virus or not . It has been recently shown that leukemia in cats is definitely caused by a virus . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humans ? the biggest difference being that in dogs , cats , and cows , it is usually localized in solid tissues , especially lymphoid organs , and infrequently shows a true leukemia blood picture as seen in man . " The significance of the viruslike particles in cow 's milk ? or their possible effect on humans ? is not known . The study which we have under way was designed to evaluate the possible biologic significance of these particles on man 's nearest relatives , the nonhuman primate . At present we have only a limited number of animals in the study , and as yet have not seen any abnormalities in their blood pictures . We make monthly blood tests and physical examinations . Other determinations will include biopsies , electron microscopic studies , cytogenetics , and so on . One half of the animals in the study will be raised on control milk diets . If we find any blood changes or other abnormalities , we will then evaluate the effects of pasteurization on the cow 's milk . " One often hears that nonhuman primates seldom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen six animals with tumors . Two of these , in chimpanzees , were benign . The four cases seen in monkeys were all ma- lignant . Leukemia has not been reported in the chimpanzee , and is very infrequently reported in monkeys . " We also have for observation a group of irradiated monkeys who were exposed to atomic bomb explosions in 1956 and ' 57 at the Nevada testing site . They 've been followed ever since , and I 've been working on the project ever since I came to Yerkes . We have a breeding program to see the effects , if any , on their reproductive functions . Out of nineteen births we had 40 percent stillbirths , which is very high : the usual number is 5 to 10 percent . Of course , these animals are relatively old ? the species lives , more or less , for twenty years . In one adult female exposed to a heavy dose , we found two chromosomes not usually found in monkeys , but she may always have been abnormal , as the animals were not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Attempts to breed her have been unsuccessful . And ? oh , yes ? she has bilateral cataracts and shows accelerated graying of the hair . One member of the group that died in 1968 had two primary malignant tumors ? sarcoma of the thigh and a malignant tumor of the kidney . Electron-microscopic study of the thigh tumor showed a relatively large number of viruslike particles . Unfortunately we did n't do transmission studies , and the tumor cells could not be kept alive in tissue culture ; consequently , we do n't know the significance of these viruslike particles . The type of thigh tumor observed in this animal has not been previously reported in primates , and I think that its occurrence in this animal is most likely related to her exposure to irradiation . Kidney tumors have been noted previously to occur spontaneously in monkeys . " Dr. Charles E. Graham , whose field is cancer and reproductive biology , comes from England , where he began his work on cervical cancer histogenesis . There he worked on mice , studying the histological changes that occur when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where their tumors originated . " I 'm just finishing that study , " he said , " and to tell you the truth I 'm sorry I ca n't work any more with rodents . You see , we have no cervical cancer model among the primates . We want to develop a model for the study of histogenesis of cervical tumor in the primate . We 've had two years with the squirrel monkey , injecting carcinogen ? but we had no luck ; we got no lesions . Now we 're trying the bush baby . Also , we 're in close touch with people at a hospital nearby on the Herpes type of virus ? Herpes genitalis , Type Two . There 's evidence that this organism is somehow connected with the genesis of cervical cancer . Frankly we 're still looking for a suitable primate ? we 're considering cebus monkeys at the  | moment , because this species is susceptible to the virus , but survives its attack . We 've inoculated seven animals with the virus , and we 're waiting now for lesions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of success , but we 're hoping for neoplastic lesions . Anyway , we 've got an animal that takes the virus , and that 's something . " The other half of my work is studying the reproductive system of the great apes ? the project is funded by the Ford Foundation , and it 's to last for three years . I 'm working on that with Dr. Janet MacArthur at the Massachusetts General Hospital , also Dr. John Preedy here at the school of medicine , an authority on steroid hormones . We hope to obtain additional basic knowledge necessary to develop improved methods of population control . Of course , these problems are of pressing importance just now . Our main object is to ascertain the similarities and differences between apes and humans in respect to hormonal control of the sexual cycle . " We know there are differences , and an understanding of these is likely to be as illuminating as the likenesses . If we understood the basic endocrinology of apes better , we could undertake more experimental studies ? in fact , we 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a peripheral artery ; the hormone finally passed through the gonads . Then we opened the animal 's abdomen , by means of a cannula placed in the appropriate vein , and collected the blood as it left the ovary or testis . We hope to determine how the steroid hormone is metabolized as it goes through the gonad . This type of experiment is very difficult to do with humans , as you can imagine . Apes are much better animals for this than the lesser primates . Chimps are especially useful because of the sexual swelling exhibited by the females : human females show no such external evidence of turtling . This swelling is potentially a useful guide to when ovulation occurs . Even so , we are not sure just when ovulation occurs in the chimpanzee , but we hope to find out . What is the hormonal control of sex swelling ? We are trying to find out . " Professor Hal Warner describes himself as an audio engineer who was in radar and worked on the space program in 1958 before coming to Yerkes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on impedance exploration of the brain , " he said . " We find the area in the brain we want to examine , determine the local co-ordinates of the structure , then insert an electrode . Through this impedance technique , photographically , we produce , in effect , impedance-stained brain sections where white matter , a high impedance tissue , photographs light and gray matter , a low impedance tissue , photographs darker . " We have found that live and dead brains do not differ much in their  | impedance profile , although the absolute impedance itself may vary . What is significant is the profile . It is possible to scan the whole brain , section by section , in much the same way that you would scan a scene for television . " Much of Professor Warner 's work was explained graphically by designs and charts . One , labelled " Investigation of Intracerebral Hemorrhage , " could hardly be misunderstood even by a beginner , but he willingly explained it nevertheless . " When an artery in the brain ruptures , the brain suffers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You see the brain contains glial cells called astrocytes , which , as some believe , like tiny placentae , take nourishment from the blood , feed the nerve cells , and remove waste . These astrocytes are believed by some investigators to form the bloodbrain barrier . Since normally blood is never in contact directly with the brain tissue , perhaps some of the profound paralysis resulting from a cerebral hemorrhage is due to this intimate contact . For instance , we know serotonin can cause spasms in blood vessels . Perhaps other constituents in the extravasated blood can cause embarrassment to neurons as well as vessels . We also wonder about possible electrical effects . " " Do we ? " I murmured . My mind was full of bewildering images : I seemed to be standing inside a giant brain , something like a boiler room where a very large pipe had just exploded . Hunks of molten metal were lying around , and boiling water was gushing out of a jagged hole . Professor Warner continued firmly , " There is also the possibility of electrical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this blood contact , which may embarrass the propagation of the action potential ? " In order to investigate separately these damage factors , it was necessary to create an artificial bleed in an animal . Silicone oil is a biologically inert substance , so I inserted a stainless-steel cannula into the brain 's internal capsule and fixed it to the skull with acrylic cement . Then I injected a measured number of cc of sterile silicon oil at normal blood pressure ... " One thing I 'd like to know more about , " I said to Dr. Bourne just before taking leave , " is how you used chimpanzees as blood washers . Was n't there something about two small girls ? " He said , " Oh , yes . Two little girls ? one three years old and the other five . The cases did n't occur at the same time , but they had a good deal in common : each had liver damage ; each child was in a coma when she arrived ; and each was linked up by rubber tubes with the chimp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The first child was linked up for six hours , and the other for sixteen . In the first case the blood chemis- try dropped to normal after the six hours , but the child never came around : there 'd been too much brain damage , and she just died . However , it was demonstrated that , a chimpanzee kidney actually would work as a kind of kidney machine , in cleaning the blood . In the second case the little girl woke up and could remember her name and telephone number . She could even sing a little song she knew . She lived three weeks , but her bone marrow was damaged and her blood would n't clot . However , the chimpanzee had indubitably pulled her out of the coma . The fact is , she 'd been brought in too late , as a last resort ; otherwise , I think , it would have been a successful operation . The chimp got the virus , of course ? infectious hepatitis ? but did n't get sick : it survived very well . We quarantined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free of the virus . " Not long after visiting Yerkes I learned more of this kind of cross-circulation from reading abstracts of talks that had been given at a conference on experimental medicine and surgery in primates , held in New York in 1969 and sponsored by the New York University School of Medicine . Five doctors had collaborated on an experiment closely related to this work ? Edward I. Goldsmith , J. Moor-Jankowski , Alexander S. Wiener , F. H. Allen , and Robert Hirsch . " Temporary cross-circulation between human patients in liver failure and nonhuman primate partners may be clinically valuable , " they wrote , " but the methods of preparation of donor animals and the immunological consequences remain to be defined . " They had therefore worked out a program for choosing " appropriate animals " and preparing them as safely , simply , and economically as possible for the process . Having ascertained which animals had blood close enough to the human types for the purpose , the doctors had taken two species , rhesus and baboon , and " exchange transfused " them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The procedure apparently requires the most careful attention " to preoperative typing and crossmatching and body temperature maintenance , blood pressure monitoring and calcium replacement during exchange , " but with all this taken care of , the animals can survive on virtually too percent human red blood cells for four to five days , and during the first two days of this period they might serve as cross-circulation partners for human patients . In fact , as another report at the same conference testified , the experiment was actually carried out at the Rochester Medical Center , where cross-circulation was arranged between a woman of sixty-six , who was in deep coma from an advanced stage of hepatitis , and a baboon prepared according to the technique described above . The baboon was typed and matched with the patient and a cross-circulation lasting five hours was in- stituted . During the first three hours of this period , " the patient 's level of consciousness improved slightly , although she did not become conscious . . . . There was improvement in the results of all tests as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she actually woke up for a little while and spoke a few words . But she soon lapsed back into coma , and six days later she died . The autopsy showed that her liver was completely necrotic ? that is , the cells were dead . Another baboon was used in similar fashion , but with a happier outcome , for cross-circulation with a twenty-one-year-old woman waiting for a liver transplant . She had gone into a deep coma which did not respond to the usual methods of treatment , and according to the report , " Crosscirculation was carried out for eight hours with dramatic relief of the patient 's coma . " I made the acquaintance of two of the originators of the preparation method , Dr. Jan Moor-Jankowski of the New York University School of Medicine and Dr. Edward Goldsmith of Cornell University Medical College , at the place where they spend much of their working time ? the New York University Hospital 's primate laboratory in Sterling Forest , near Tuxedo . To my eye , accustomed by this time to large , rambling primate center @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small and simple as well as pretty . It harmonized well with the surrounding rocks and trees . Dr. Moor-Jankowski seemed pleased when I said as much . " We have spent as little as possible on building , " he said . " This is the only permanent part of the place : all the laboratory sections and animal shelters are in trailers which can be moved around when we find it necessary . " He led the way to a clearing in which stood the prefab laboratory ? large trailers like railway coaches , with a shining metal finish . Inside these coaches , once one had learned to discount the hollow feeling of one 's footsteps , it was easy to forget the temporary nature of the housing because the equipment was so complete . There was a trailer like an office ? well , it was an office ? and behind it were laboratories , all carefully kept antiseptic . In a separate cluster of trailers were the accommodations for chimpanzees and other primates . The laboratory section had everything , even a movie projector , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nematode worms that get into the bloodstream from infected water . Filaria are a scourge in the warm regions of both hemispheres . Like men , baboons ( as well as other mammals ) are vulnerable to them , and by using baboons , a means has been contrived to filter these parasites out of the blood by mechanical means . Dr. Moor-Jankowski then led me into another trailer where I watched  | a chimpanzee being prepared for a routine inoculation . She was a young animal of four or five , but she knew all about the squeeze-cage ( it is a contraption for holding the octupant motionless ) from earlier experience , and she wanted no part of it . She screamed with rage and fear until one of the attendants managed to shoot into her a sedative much used in animal laboratories , called by its trade name , Sernylan . " In a few minutes she 'll be all right , " said Dr. Moor-Jankowski . It was true : very soon she calmed down and looked quite happy . If it did n't sound anthropomorphic I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but in a stronger dose , was administered to a large adult male baboon whose sperm was wanted for experiments in artificial insemination . He quickly went to sleep , and was taken from his cage perfectly safely . " Artificial insemination with primates is n't as easy as it is with cattle , " one of the doctors told me . " With subhuman primates , anyway , almost immediately after ejaculation the stuff hardens and turns into a sort of tough jelly . In natural copulation it forms a plug and keeps the sperm safe inside the female : I suppose that 's how it developed . Otherwise arboreal animals would lose the seed through cavorting around in trees . But it makes things difficult for us here . We 're trying if we can quick-freeze it and yet keep the organisms alive , but the method has n't proved satisfactory so far , and after all , if you 've got to use the sperm immediately to get any good out of it , you defeat the whole object of the exercise . " Dr. Moor-Jankowski 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the conference , lie in the field of serology . A few days later he arranged a visit for me to the office of Dr. Wiener , who is professor of forensic medicine at the New York University School of Medicine and city serologist in the office of the Chief Medical Examiner . Both these departments were represented , in a way , in his laboratory . At least , the place was full of test-tube racks and mysterious computerlike machines , while in the corner was a broken paving stone with a large brown stain spilled on it . Dr. Wiener saw me looking at that in a puzzled way , and explained , " They 've sent this to me to find out if that stain is blood : someone 's coming up for trial in a murder case , and this stone is part of the evidence . It 's blood all right . " He talked to me of the similarities and dissimilarities of human and subprimate blood , of the various antibodies , and of titers with which these are measured . In his enthusiasm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twice I saw a female assistant glance at him anxiously and then look at her watch . After the session , happening to meet me alone in the hall for a minute , she said drily . " Well , how did you enjoy getting the benefit of twenty years all in one afternoon ? "  | Over coffee , Dr. Wiener grew reminiscent about his early days when he had hesitated as to a career . " I liked mathematics , too , " he said , " and for a time I thought of specializing in that field . Even today when I want recreation I turn to mathematics . " Once he had settled for serology , he said , he found it hard to get hold of samples . " Today , with the laboratory in Sterling Forest and good communications we have with other places all over the country , we are n't faced with the same difficulties , " he continued , " but in those days ? it was n't so long ago , either ? it was a serious matter . Once when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for permission to get some from a chimp in the Central Park zoo . Today the administration of the zoo is handled by people who know what they 're doing , but then the man in charge had been given his job as a political plum , and he did n't know anything about scientific research . Still , I had to apply to him . " I told him what I wanted and assured him that it would n't hurt the animal , and so forth . He said it would be all right , but that I had to put down five hundred dollars in advance as a sort of insurance , in case the animal suffered damage or something : also , I 'd have to pay the keepers who helped me . Well , I handed over the five hundred , and that was the last I ever saw of it ? not that I 'd expected anything else . Then I fixed things up with the keepers , two of them . They told me to be there after closing hours so the public would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met them in the monkey house . " The chimp cage was down at the far end of the place , past all the other monkeys . It was a simple operation ? one of the men held up a banana outside the cage bars , and when the chimp reached out to get it , they both grabbed his arm and held on tight while I hurried to take the sample . Then they let go , handed him his banana , shook hands with me and collected their pay , and left by the side door while I started down to the front one . " I had two test tubes of chimp blood in my vest pocket , and I was feeling pretty pleased with myself , when all of a sudden something hit me in the back of the neck with quite a wallop ? something wet . The chimp had spit at me , all that way , and in the dark at that . Remarkable aim he had . "  | Dr. Harry F. Harlow , head of both the Wisconsin Regional Primate Research Center @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ university in Madison , Wisconsin , once told a friend how his particular branch of research happened to get started . It was before the center was formed , and Harlow 's domain was limited to the laboratory . That day he was showing the place to a distinguished visitor , the English psychiatrist Dr. John Bowlby . Standing between two rows of cages in each of which a rhesus monkey sat alone , one after another , cage after cage , the two men spoke of Pavlov , who was experimenting with neurosislike behaviors in various nonhuman animals . " I wish I could get hold of a few neurotic monkeys , " said Harlow fervently . " If only one could find them ! " Dr. Bowlby bent on him a mildly astonished gaze . " But you 've got dozens of them right here , " he said , with a gesture that took in the whole room . " How many do you want ? " " He was right , of course , " said Harry Harlow in retrospect , " but we simply had n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we were used to it . We were aware that if a rhesus is kept in isolation long enough it develops all sorts of psychopathological behaviors ? thumbsucking , or self-hugging , or just staring into the distance ? but we needed a psychiatrist to point out the obvious fact that we 'd been raising mon- keys for years with just the sort of abnormalities we needed to produce syndromes analogous to human disorders . " Thus when , in 1961 , the NIH tapped Madison as one of the seven locations for the primate centers they were planning , a foundation was already there . To the laboratory staff the center plans were more than welcome : they had had to fight hard for what they held , and had long been haunted by a sense of insecurity . When Harlow came to Wisconsin in 1930 , he discovered very quickly that as a member of the Psychology Department he was , to say the least , underprivileged . On asking his chief to show him to the animal laboratory , he was told , " We tore it down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to fool around in it as a child ? a wooden bungalow structure of hexagonal shape , in which a few guinea pigs and rabbits moped in makeshift enclosures and nobody was there to tell me not to pet or feed them . For all its shortcomings , however , its disappearance must have been disconcerting to the newly arrived Harry Harlow . For lack of anywhere else , he went to work at the local zoo in Vilas Park : fortunately , the zoo had a fairly varied collection of primates , and primates were what he wanted to work with . In a talk he gave during a meeting in the sixties , he cast his mind back to those pioneer days in the park , to an orang-utan named Jiggs . " The nicest and sweetest orang-utan that had ever lived at any zoo for fifteen years , " he said . " We gave him two oak blocks , one with a square hole and one with a round hole , and a square plunger and a round plunger . He learned to put the round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the square hole , and he learned to put the square plunger in the square hole , but he never learned to put the square plunger in the round hole . He worked incessantly on this unsolvable problem for six weeks and then died of perforated ulcers , but at least he died demonstrating a level of intellectual curiosity greater than that of many University of Wisconsin students . " Two years of this sort of experience , however , proved that working in a zoo had many disadvantages . Harlow and his crew really had to have a better place , and they found it in an old two-story building that had formerly belonged to the Forestry Department . The psychologists moved in and began remodelling , an activity which continued for twenty years thereafter . They rebuilt , added space , fought grimly for the necessary equipment , and ? almost incidentally ? learned a good deal about monkey behavior . Out of all this came three major research projects : the development of measures of subhuman primate learning , the effects of cortical lesions on these learned behaviors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1954 the laboratory was moved wholesale to a remodelled cheese factory ? Wisconsin 's agricultural college was comparatively privileged , and did n't need it any more ? and at last , in 1959 , it actually gained the dignity of a proper name of its own , the Department of Psychology Primate Laboratory . Legends began to accrue around it . " One of the brightest monkeys we ever had was number 13o , " said Dr. Harlow . She was living in one of our combined indoor-outdoor cages , and there were always two doors between her and freedom . This did not bother number Igo in the least because she outthought the graduate students on the average of once a week . She knew all about people and knew that they were careless , indifferent , shiftless , and stupid . She would bide her time , and at the chosen moment the graduate student would find himself in the cage and find 130 outside the cage . She spent more than half of her last summer in the upper branches of a large elm tree , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caught was when she read that rain was predicted . However , her peregrinations in no way interfered with our testing program because she could solve as many problems in two days as any other monkey could in seven . " One of Harlow 's assistants at this time was a coed named Audrey . " We had six baby monkeys that we had separated from their mothers at birth , " he says , " and we kept each monkey isolated in a separate cage . We wanted to keep them isolated for two years and then study their initial social responses . Audrey was taking care of them on the night shift . Late one evening I went over to the lab , opened the door to the baby room , and there was Audrey sitting in the center of the floor playing with all six monkeys . They all had the same I.Q. and they were having a wonderful time . " She did n't give me a chance to say a thing . She arose to her full five feet two inches of enraged femininity and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in secondary education , and I have been trained , and I know that it is improper and immoral to blight the normal social development of children . I am right and you are wrong . ' " We did n't know that we had been paying her to serve as a baby-sitter , " adds Dr. Harlow . " One year 's time and five thousand dollars forever lost . I was angry , but I also had some respect for little Audrey . I felt that perhaps we had something in common . One must have faith in what one does . However , I can assure you that Audrey and those monkeys never played together again . " Four years have passed , and Audrey has twice been pregnant , which is more than one can say for any of the monkeys . Last week I observed these monkeys in their cages , sitting staring into space , sucking their thumbs , engaging in unending stereotyped movements . It came to me as  | a complete shock ; the monkeys were abnormal , and their social lives had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something to this secondary-education business after all . However , it was n't necessary for Audrey to tell us . We found it all out through research ? but it took us four years longer . This illustrates the power of the inductive method . If you work hard enough and long enough , you will eventually learn some of the things that other people already know . " Since its dedication in April 1964 , the Wisconsin Primate Center has taken on that indescribable patina of a university building that belongs on the campus just as certainly as do its neighbors . A brief description furnished by the NIH told me that its main research orientation is , naturally enough , behavioral and physical development , but other and related areas are " brain function , mental retardation , biochemical mechanisms of learning , abnormal behavior , nutrition , pregnancy radiation , cardiovascular disorders and amino acid metabolism . " Between them the center and laboratory , along with a " holding facility " at Vilas Park Zoo , maintain eleven hundred animals , most of them rhesus . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was taking her Ph.D . at Wisconsin just then in behavioral psychology , under the guidance of Associate Professor Gene P. Sackett of the Department of Psychology Primate Laboratory . Sackett has an impressive lot of publications to his credit : " Some Effects of Social and Sensory Deprivation During Rearing on Behavioral Development of Monkeys " is one example . Published in the Revista Interamericana de Psicologia in March 1967 , it says among other things that according to Dr. Harlow 's findings , a year of isolation is particularly devastating for the animal 's socialization ; also , that monkey infants who have never been near a real monkey respond to pictures of monkeys , even reacting to threatening poses in those pictured animals . Connie took me to see a number of infant monkeys ? baby rhesus , I would have called them ? troublingly appealing with their small , wrinkled faces . One of them , as if to get a better look at me , clung upside down to the bars of her cage . " I 'm comparing their rates of development , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For instance , I have a monkey infant living with its mother . Well , I compare its behavior and learning ability , and so on , with another infant deprived of maternal support . We are also bringing up certain monkeys that just live in their cages without anything to do ? no stimulation ? and we compare their accomplishment in tests with that of other monkeys that live in an enriched environment . " " What does that mean , an enriched environment ? " Connie gave me the sort of look she usually reserves for her mother .  | " More space and plenty of toys , " she said . " Offhand , before we 've evaluated our findings , it looks as if monkeys reared in these privileged surroundings prove to be more aggressive and quicker to learn than the deprived ones . Within peer groups , they tend to dominate . " A minuscule leader in the making deserted her mother and flopped across the cage to threaten me , opening her tiny mouth to show almost invisible teeth . " Surely you knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " I asked . " I mean , of course , privileged motleys would be more bossy . " " You ca n't leap to conclusions , " said Connie severely . " In this work the great danger is anthropomorphism . " I found Dr. George P. Kerr , from the Department of Pediatrics at the Medical Center of Wisconsin University , explaining a piece of research to three young visitors . " We 're investigating malnutrition and its effect , if any , on the brain , " he announced . " For some years I 've been making observations of human children who 've been undernourished , and now we 're comparing them with infrahuman primates with the same background . You see , some people believe that certain children who do n't grow as rapidly as they should are victims of what 's called ' deprivational dwarfism , ' because they have lacked environmental stimulation . " The question we posed ourselves was whether this slow growth might not be due , instead , to simple malnutrition . We tried raising infant monkeys under various conditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for example , or enough food but an otherwise deprived environment . Now we know what a child 's normal growth rate is : it 's very abrupt in early life ? that is , the child grows very fast ? and then , after a while , the rate slows down , and on the graph the curve begins to flatten out . We know that the same condition , more or less , obtains with infant monkeys . Therefore we have raised a number of animals in isolation but with the normal amount of nourishment : these animals developed behavioral abnormalities , but their growth rates were comparable with those of normal animals . " The result suggests that social stimulation is not a prerequisite for physical growth , and it indicates that deprivational dwarfism is very probably caused by inadequate nutrition rather than lack of social stimulation . When we look again at undersized human children , we are led to conclude that they have simply not been fed enough . Mind you , this may still depend , indirectly , on social conditions . A child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may very well lose its appetite . When social conditions improve and the child is happier , it eats a lot . "  | He showed us on a projection screen the graph of the growth of a child who was half starved up to the age of two but was properly fed from then on . " Notice that the weight catches up . But height and bone age do not , " he said . Bone age is the state of development of the bone in relation to that of a normal individual . " It 's a general rule that primates stop growing at puberty , but if puberty is delayed growth continues . This little girl 's growth is only retarded , and will catch up in time . It appears that the time of puberty depends on bone age . As for the rest , there is no doubt that her learning capacity has been somewhat affected by malnutrition , or ? this is the question ? is it a simple cause-and-effect pattern or merely coincidental ? We ca n't draw conclusions until we know more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least an indirect relationship between nutrition and retardation . " Next he talked of PKU , or phenylketonuria , a congenital faulty metabolism of the amino acid , phenylalanine . This amine is essential for the production of proteins , but too much of it produces mental retardation . If the condition of PKU is diagnosed in a human baby soon enough after birth and he is put on a special diet for the next six years , chances are that he will be normal or at least nearly normal . But when a woman with PKU becomes pregnant , the excessive amino acid in her blood gets into the unborn infant at an even more concentrated level , and the unfortunate child is born retarded . So far , nothing much can be done for such cases of inheritance and concentration . But Dr. Kerr and another Wisconsin scientist , Dr. Harry Waisman , have been able to reproduce the PKU condition in pregnant rhesus monkeys with high phenylalanine diets , and the infants after birth show deficits in learning . The condition in these monkeys can be studied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Dr. John W. Davenport is also working on mental retardation at Madison , with rats as well as primates . " They 're easier subjects , " he said as we watched , on one of those closed-circuit TV sets , a number of hypothyroid rats going through their paces . " Of course , they 're a lot more limited , but we can produce whole batteries of retardate rats in a comparatively short time , look at their learning deficits , and get good leads for our primate studies on thyroid function and intelligence . Our primate studies of mental retardation , including those on hypothyroidism and malnutrition , are going even faster now because we have a computer for massive I.Q. testing of monkeys . We can work with larger intelligence batteries . We 've worked out tasks that really do show significant differences between normals and hypothyroids . It 's a funny thing , but all this grew out of a quite different research problem on studying a drug called TCAP which was  | supposed to increase I.Q. because of its ability to stimulate brain metabolism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antithyroid agent as well , and we have been finding permanent learning deficits from this drug , similar to those in rats and monkeys whose thyroids have been destroyed . " One of the questions we have to answer is , What kind of intelligence is affected by these various agents ? Even now it might be ten years before we can answer with any assurance , but with the computer we can telescope , and do in one year what used to take three . " In our primate studies , thyroidectomy is producing some fascinating puzzles . For instance , Dr. Kerr and I have injected pregnant monkeys with radioactive iodine : the iodine carries over into the baby ? enough to destroy the baby 's thyroid gland ? and at birth the baby shows many behavioral signs of cretinism . But the physical growth rate seems unaffected even though the textbook dogma for many years has held that thyroid hormones are essential for over-all fetal growth . If these infants are given thyroxin , the prenatal damage to the nervous system is not reversed , as one might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early days for us to be sure it does . " He paused and thought . " We have an oddball situation here , " he added . " A lot more is known about hypothyroidism in the human than in monkeys . " In Dr. Harlow 's department of psychology , a playroom behind a large plate-glass window was occupied by four young rhesus , two of which had been kept in isolation until recently , whereas the other two had grown up in ordinary social groups . Researchers watched solemnly and took notes of their antics . The object of the study , I gathered , was to find out how long it took the isolates to recover from their stereotyped behaviors and join the gang like normal monkeys . The groups were changed from time to time , and the histories of the isolates taken into account , for the length of time they had spent in isolation had a direct effect on the length of time it took them to recover . Those that had been alone for three months , when put back with their peers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking such a prominent place in modern vocabularies ? have proved to make dramatic comebacks in behavior quite suddenly ; though until lately , I was told , they were believed irrecoverable . " The social effects of such rearing experiences are now well established , " according to the center 's publication , Mainly Monkeys . " Subjects reared for the first 6 months of life in total isolation exhibit permanent deficits in exploratory play , sexual , and maternal behavior , while subjects isolated from birth for longer periods of time ( 12 and 18 months ) are almost obliterated socially . " " The article goes on to say that those reared for long periods in only  | partial isolation , where they can see and hear but not touch other monkeys , display some positive social behaviors , but in all situations are socially inferior to normal control monkeys . They also exhibit various special behaviors that can be broadly categorized as psychopathological . If the partial isolation is prolonged , the animal goes round and round its cage and even attacks and wounds its own body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our age , and for some years Wisconsin researchers have tried to produce genuine depression like that of human beings in monkeys , so that methods of treatment might be evolved . The difficulty has always been that the subjects , though they do exhibit symptoms analogous to our depressions , make such quick recoveries that scientists have had to conclude that their syndromes are not signs of the true malady found in humans . Recently , however , research people at Madison have discovered what might be an effective way of reproducing this mental disease . As any nurse in an old-fashioned children 's hospital in England can attest , human children from six to twelve months old , if separated from their parents for long periods of time , exhibit certain well-known symptoms : dejection , stupor , lowered activity and general withdrawal , in that order . Dr. Bowlby writes that slightly older children react in the same manner , and he divides this reaction into three phases : ( a ) initial protest , exhibited by increased crying , screaming , and general activity ; ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ c ) detachment , where the children , reunited with their parents , appear indifferent or even hostile . ( But Bowlby has recently said that he is now not sure of phase three : it is not an invariable part of the reaction . ) Baby monkeys in similar circumstances behave in much the same way except that the reaction is not so prolonged , and there is no detachment behavior upon reunion . " It may be , " say the researchers in an article in Mainly Monkeys , " that the technique of separation from an attachment object is , by itself , insufficient to produce such desired behavioral effects . We view this finding with little surprise for we firmly believe that any behavioral syndrome as severe and complex as depression is unlikely to be mediated by any single variable . " Depression or depression-like behaviors can only be produced by a combination of depressing circumstances : merely one such circumstance is not enough . To this end the researchers have worked out a combination of trials for the subjects : social isolation , plus separation from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of movement , plus scary happenings , plus alteration of day-night cycles ? a change that seems to worry them . " We wanted to produce a stable depression , " explained Stephen Suomi , who is working on this experiment , " so that we would have time to work with one depressed subject before it recovered by itself . Thanks  | to an invention of Harlow 's , called the vertical chamber ? in fact , it 's more or less a pit ? we can achieve total isolation combined with restriction of movement . First the monkey is removed from its mother and isolated in a vertical chamber . It is then placed for a while in a peer group . Then it 's isolated again . Well , we think we have a real depression at last ; at least we know that beyond thirty days of treatment of this sort the change lasts for at least six months . This gives us a real chance , now , to find out how to treat it ? to reverse the depression . Later we plan to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human patients do seem to exhibit altered biochemical levels of corticosteroids , and so on . We must n't be overconfident : we have to be very sure that this is a true mental depression we 've got , and that spontaneous recovery alone does not occur ? as it has done in the past with the incomplete depressions we 've produced . Then , when we are quite sure , there 'll be many more experiments : How can we reverse it ? Antidepressant drugs , perhaps ? Another question to be answered is , How susceptible are people to all these depressant factors ? Can we immunize them in advance ? Such problems are still in the future , but I do n't think it will be very long before we can consider them seriously . " " We 've got four to five hundred breeders at the center , " said Dr. Stephen G. Eisele , whose province is the breeding program . " They 're in various different categories : we have 170 pregnant ones right now , and we try to space out the births . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the effects of certain artificial sweeteners , for instance , and some are needed by Dr. R. C. Wolf for physiological research ? about ten to fifteen , depending on what he 's doing ? many go into mental retardation or depression studies , and others are strictly for fetal research . It 's wonderful what they can do in that field . Nowadays you can take a fetus out , inject it , replace it , and it will go full term and be born successfully . We can study ovarian blood now . Also , we 've had unusual success with artificial insemination , which is n't anything like as simple with primates as it is with domestic animals ? lots of people said it could n't be done at all . But we do it . I 'd say that twenty to twenty-five of the males here have bred all our five hundred mothers . " In the early days we bred animals only for Harlow and his motherlove studies . This was often difficult because the maternally deprived animals did n't know how to copulate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ females , but now that we know a lot more about the behavioral difficulties it does n't matter . We know that the ovum always drops fifteen to nineteen days before the menstrual period , and that occurs every twenty-eight days for seven or eight months of the year . Then , for some reason we still do n't understand , an atypical pattern sets  | in for the remaining four months of the year . " The female rhesus is a beautiful subject for this work because of the coloration of her sex skin : you , can always tell exactly what stage she 's at just by looking at the color between her legs . Here , you can see ; we 've drawn up a color chart . To use it , you keep in your head the color the female is today and correlate it with yesterday 's color . Here 's the strongest red , before it starts getting paler day by day . Two days before the color breaks down you have a 70 percent chance of ovulation , and this phase can last anywhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five . " Now here 's an interesting contraption . In the past , Dr. Harlow raised monkeys in isolation or semi-isolation , and many of the female animals , as they matured , did not show basic sexual behaviors and consequently were very difficult to impregnate . So this restraining device was built to hold the female in proper position while the male copulated with her . We call it the rape rack . Nowadays , though , with improved techniques in artificial insemination we do n't have to use it . Artificial insemination is much more efficient . One ejaculation can be used to serve as many as twenty-five females , but usually we stretch it only to ten . " I went from Dr. Eisele to Dr. Wolf , who talked on a related subject ; the hormonal requirements of primates during implantation in pregnancy ? when the fertilized ovum attaches itself to the inside of the uterus . In other animals , such as the rat , if ovarian estrogen is not present , the pregnancy is interrupted , but this does not seem to be true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ removed the ovaries from eleven female monkeys that had been mated , between the second 4nd sixth day after ovulation , then injected them daily with progesterone ? but not estrogen ? until the day of parturition . Eight of the animals maintained pregnancy in spite of the operation , but one of these aborted soon afterwards . Then two more monkeys were mated and ovariectomized before implantation , but these were not given the progesterone : they did not maintain their pregnancy . " This work , of course , has bearing on the Pill and other methods of population control . " Shigella is the great problem in all monkey colonies , " said Dr. W. D. Houser . " It 's universal . " Shigella are the , bacteria that cause bacillary dysentery in humans . " Everybody who works at a center gets what we call monkey fever ' within the first few days ? nothing serious , diarrhea and slight fever , probably from inhaling fecal material in the air or by some similar ingestion . Then you build up an immunity , and it does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But what was interesting " ? here his eyes lighted up ? " was an infec- tion of Klebsiella pneumoniae we had in the spring of 1969 , an atypical form that had n't been reported before , in infant monkeys . First we noticed that a few monkeys were getting very depressed , and soon we had all kinds of things ? meningitis , peritonitis , cystitis , arthritis , and subdermal abscesses . I can tell you , we were busy . Three monkeys died , and the other cases needed a lot of therapy before they recovered . As far as we can make out , the infants were infected at birth , through the umbilicus . The organism resisted most antibiotics , until at last we found a couple that worked . We drained the abscesses . They 're all right now . First reported case in history , " he repeated proudly . During my latest visit to Madison , I found Connie busily taking notes in a room containing two cages not side by side , but connected here and there with wires and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of tiny , mysterious gadgets ? handles , buttons , and boxes of differing dimensions . " I 'm testing their learning ability and reactions , " she explained . " This one on my right can turn on a picture show whenever he likes ? colored slides , you know , one after another , on that little screen thing . When he gets tired of watching those , he can get himself a drink of water by pulling the string here . He can make this toy slide up and down , and open that inner door or shut it . He can turn on a light and turn it off again , and he can feed himself ? within reason , that is . In other words , he controls his own environment . " Now over here in the other cage the same things happen , but the monkey ca n't do them himself : they happen because the other monkey makes them happen . The environment of this second infant depends on the whim of the first one . He ca n't control his environment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first monkey 's face , which , though still infantile , was definitely smug . The expression of a leader . The Washington Primate Research Center at Seattle is so closely intertwined with the state university that it seems ? and is ? even more a part of the academic building complex than that at Wisconsin . Dr. Theodore C. Ruch , the director , is widely known for his book Diseases of Laboratory Primates and for the Bibliographica Primatologica , which has developed into a nationwide and worldwide bibliographical service . Before becoming one of the founding professors of the medical school at Seattle in 1946 , he spent some time at Yale in the ambience of the never-to-be-forgotten Robert Mearns Yerkes and John Farquhar Fulton : he says he  | learned there that , public prejudice to the contrary , monkeys can make good neighbors . " They do not have to be consigned to a large tract of land in the country or banished to the roof or the basement , " he said to an interviewer . Nevertheless it was against a good deal of opposition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the center is built , an " I " building that connects the basic medical science departments and medical and dental school complex on one side with a biochemistry-genetics building on the other . Within these long , long passageways , therefore , the biomedical sciences work together cheek by jowl ? but an elaborate system of doors between them and the primate colony must be kept closed at all times , as if to repel some Wellsian invasion by well-drilled infrahuman troops . Outside , against the state of Washington 's lush greenery , the effect is tidy and pleasing , and so is indoors ? though grim dramas are sometimes played out in the monkey colonies housed in the laboratories . The walls have seen more than one breaching , for example , as in the case of the Japanese macaque troop that lived for a time on the top floor . These monkeys , sturdy red-faced creatures stockier than rhesus and weighing as much as forty pounds when they are adult , live by choice in tight social groups under a dominant male , and the Seattle troop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manner , with a top boss , several promising underlings who kept an eye on their chances of promotion , females , bachelor males , and juveniles . One day a research worker came up to see how they were getting on , and found their exercise yard empty ? or so he thought ? for cleaning . Assuming that the monkeys were confined in their waiting yard , he wandered out onto the floor , only to be attacked suddenly by the Old Man , who had been lurking behind some architectural feature or other . Japanese macaques , as I have said , are sturdy , and they are also supplied with long , wicked teeth . The angry Old Man launched a flying leap at the intruder , who landed a punch on the monkey 's chest , hitting him more or less by accident in the right spot . The Old Man fell stunned to the floor , and the human made his escape . Before the Old Man had come to his senses , one of the eager young pretenders had taken his place . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his strength back the old order would be resumed , but no : from that time on , things stayed as they now were . The new king fought off the old one successfully , and after that one attempt the old one never tried again . " He had lost face , " my informant explained . Just before my first visit to Seattle I had read an article by two people working at the Washington Primate Center , Dr. Gordon E. Jensen and  | Dr. Ruth A. Bobbitt , in the May 1968 number of the magazine Psychology Today . The doctors explained in the introduction that they were starting at a point to which they had been led by the studies of Dr. Harlow and his wife Margaret , which demonstrated that infant monkeys deprived of maternal care , if they are brought up among normal peers , may still develop essentially normal social behavior . Doctors Jensen and Bobbitt studied another type of behavior , the mother-infant relationship . They did not use rhesus for this work , preferring the slightly larger pigtail macaque , Macaca nemestrina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a number of infants more or less the same age , they arranged that the prospective mothers should be mated at the same time . I noticed that they employed the same stratagem favored by the Wisconsin staff when the time came for birth . Monkeys usually give birth at about 2:00 A.M. , a most inconvenient hour for Homo sapiens who want to be present on such occasions , so the pregnant monkeys were kept on a reversed lighting and feeding schedule , to make them think day was night and night was day . It worked . The mothers were persuaded to go into labor in what was actually early afternoon , and the attendants got their full night 's sleep . At Seattle the researchers carried this system even further : not only did they reverse the day-and-night sequence and the feeding schedule , but during the true nighttime they kept a radio going in the laboratory , tuned to an all-night disk-jockey program . Throughout the night the pregnant pigtails were thus fooled into thinking that the world was awake and working , and cheerfully waited until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do their stuff . Jensen and Bobbitt , of course , were waiting , notebooks and pencils at the ready . Soon they were able to record an interesting observation . The old idea of the monkey mother who just sits and clutches her child does n't apply very long to M. nemestrina . Affectionate and protective at first , the mother soon starts pushing away the infant , insisting that he learn to get along by himself . Anyone who has watched how a cat , expecting a new litter , discourages her growing kittens from nursing will get the idea ? but a pigtail mother is not pregnant when she chases her baby away : it is merely her way of life . One might say that she has other things on her mind : she can be described as a working-mother type . Nemestrina mothers , the researchers decided , are natural " leavers , " whereas the infants , reluctant to accept this state of affairs , are " approachers . " ( Living in England , I have suffered quite a lot of disapproval from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is unnatural . I am seriously considering taking a troop of pigtail macaques back with me and setting them loose in the Hertfordshire woods . That should show the English what is natural and what isn't. )  | But Dr. Jensen and Dr. Bobbitt had only begun their researches . " One of our goals , " they wrote , " was to determine how isolation of naturally mothered infants would affect their development . We wanted to know if isolated , mother-raised infants without playmates , or with later contact with playmates , would develop normally . We arranged a study of mothered monkey infants according to the amount of contact with playmates of the same age , ranging from none at all , through visual and auditory contact only , to full and free association . If we could understand the importance in humans of contact with companions of the same age , we might be able to devise improved child-rearing guides for parents and programs for optional institutional and foster care of children . This study also showed the effects of deprived and enriched environments on monkey development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that would supply conditions of deprived , delayed-enriched , and enriched . In the deprived environment , mother and infant lived in bare quarters , cut off from contact with man or other monkey . In the delayed-enriched environment , mother and child were kept in a similar dwelling for four months but were then supplied with playmates and toys . In the enriched environment , the subjects had toys from the beginning , and their cage stood in a large open laboratory within sight and sound of people and other monkeys . After four months these rich baby monkeys were separated from their mothers and became playmates for the new-rich infants for two months . Then the whole lot of them were tested . The writers report : " We found that the privation environment produced prolonged physical closeness between mother and infant , or what could be called a retardation of the mutual independence process . . . . In the privation environment , the infant and mother turned to each other for most of their reinforcements . This situation is analogous to the overprotective human mother and her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ severely deprived conditions . " Nevertheless , the tendency of a mother to leave her infant , while the infant made most approaches , remained true in spite of the rearing environment . " These and other findings led us to conclude that there is a basic process to the development of mutual independence in laboratory monkeys . The process is continuous and begins in the first weeks of life rather than at a particular stage such as at weaning or later . A rich environment does not affect the nature of this process : it merely produces an earlier elaboration of the infant 's behavior towards independence . " To compare the " social adequacy " of the three types of monkey , the infants were placed together in pairs . The researchers say , " It was evident that the richer the early environment , the greater the infant 's social de- velopment . " The privileged infants dominated the deprived infants even where the deprived monkey was male and the enriched monkey female . Privileged animals usually dominated monkeys from the delayed-rich environment , and they were never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the privileged infant was at a disadvantage , snatched as he was from his mother and his comfortable home and placed in a new home with a strange playmate and the playmate 's mother , who was usually hostile . " That the rich environment infant did so well , " say the writers , " emphasizes the advantage provided by his rich environment in the earliest months of life . Conversely , the retardation in social and motor development shown by deprived infants in the earliest weeks of life later manifested itself in the poor showing of deprived infants in social and competitive situations . . . . These studies . . . suggest the potential value of human environmental enrichment programs such as Head Start ' and anti-poverty programs that provide educational and cultural opportunities for deprived school-children . " Little was said about the father 's role in pigtail family life , the authors explain , because monkeys have n't the same monogamous family structure " popularly ascribed to humans . " Males play an important part in the social organization and defense of the group , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behave as group members , but the subject of father-infant relationships , as well as leader-infant relationships , has still to be investigated . One thing , however , can be said about the differences between the sexes in the monkey world . Human mothers often claim that boys behave differently from girls right from the start . Our writers have examined this question with pigtail infants and found that with them , at least , this is true . Male monkey babies do indeed develop behavior patterns that differ from those of female monkey babies . They achieve independence sooner , and they are generally more active . As for the mothers , they punish their male babies more than females , hold and carry them less , and pay less attention to them . " Failure of human mothers to let go ' is often postulated as a cause of social problems in males , " add the doctors darkly . In conclusion , they say that their experiments have led them away from thinking in terms of the exclusive importance of Mother . " With all due respect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that satirize and spoof mother , it appears that although mothers are important , their role has been oversold . Experiments support the idea that playmates and environmental factors are important too . In time , although mothers may get less credit for man 's success , they may also receive less blame for his failure . "  | Dr. Douglas Bowden , a member of the permanent staff at the Washington Primate Center and assistant professor of psychiatry at the University of Washington School of Medicine , recently returned from three months in Russia where he worked for one month among the Russian primatologists at Sukhumi . He and his wife loved Sukhumi , which they describe as an ideal summer resort , much like northern California . " Is n't it rather unusual for you to have stayed so long ? " I asked . He said , " I guess it is , but I was part of the Soviet Academy of Sciences Exchange Program . It was a fascinating time ? I hated to come away . They 've had a group of chimps under observation there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only last year they broke it up and started getting some new ones in . All that was fascinating , too . One of those animals , I firmly believe , died of depression . Before that , she 'd never been sick in her life : she 'd been there ten or twelve years . " There were five in the group ? one male at least , as I remember , and three females , but I 'm not sure of the sex of the fifth . It does n't matter . .. . The Russians were about a year selling them off or swapping them one by one . It was noticeable that the chimps ' behavior changed with each departure . The one I 'm talking about , though , was n't sold ? they decided to keep her because she was the easiest to work with . She 'd been dominant in the group for years and was the male 's closest companion . Well , she was okay until the male was gotten rid of , and then she became quite a different creature : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was really physically ill . " They did all kinds of tests but could n't find a trace of infection . It went on like that for several weeks until at last she developed a gastrointestinal disease , and died of it . In the autopsy all they could find as an immediate cause of death was an infarction of a mesenteric vessel ? a disruption of the blood supply to a portion of the intestine . I think it was a genuine case of heartbreak . Of course , one hears many stories of animals dying mysteriously in captivity , but this was different . She 'd lived in captivity a long time . " Dr. Bowden has had his turn at studying depression in laboratory monkeys , and is interested to find that different species show very different emotional reactions to such supposedly commonplace situations as motherhood : " Langurs , for one , have n't the same attitude toward their children as macaques . In a group of langurs , children are treated like common property : everybody looks after all of them . Presumably you 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ langur . As you have no doubt heard , we 're investigating the possibilities of other primates than rhesus for lab research , and one of the interesting lines I followed a few  | years ago at the Max-Planck-Institute in Munich was connected with Saimiri sciureus , the squirrel monkey . There was an idea that they would n't be much use in research because they do n't breed well in captivity , and we tried to find out the reason . We noticed that breech delivery is a lot more frequent in monkeys than in humans . Then I 've done some work on the hormone , or proteohormone , prolactin ? it 's found in the anterior pituitary . It 's what stimulates lactation . We 've found that the level of prolactin in rats is directly related to the rat 's maternal instinct , so called . Even a male rat injected with prolactin will feel maternal ? at least that 's the way he acts . " By the way , talking of Sukhumi again , I just remembered a story they told me about a special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some time ago , before I was there . It was a kind of intelligence or adaptation test . First they trained him by lighting a little fire , taking a bucket of water , and showing him how to put the fire out by pouring the water on it . Then they gave him the bucket of water , lit the fire again , and let him do it all himself . He learned the action quickly . So far so good . For the next phase , they put him with an empty bucket on a raft on an outdoor pond near the laboratory , lit a fire on the raft , and shoved the whole contraption away from the bank , the idea being , of course , to see if he was smart enough to dip up water in the bucket for himself and put the fire out . What do you think happened ? " Dr. Bowden laughed . " He put the fire out all right ? he urinated on it . " Dr. Dwight Sutton was a visiting scientist , an associate professor in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my sabbatical here , " he said . " I 'm working with another man on the function of the auditory area of the cortex . Monkeys can hear noises all right , but often they do n't seem to care about them ? they pay no attention unless the hearing is reinforced . It 's not deafness , but there 's no doubt one ca n't get through on the proper channels . Sometimes a noise will register momentarily , but if it 's repeated , it 's ignored . We ask ourselves , therefore , how the cortex works , exactly ? How does it fade out sounds ? Because that 's what the monkey cortex does ; it edits , or damps , sounds . We have n't got a precise , valid picture as yet , but I think we 're on the track . " I 'm also doing a study of muscular control , more explicitly the mechanism of tremor , for which I 'm using stump-tailed macaques which I brought along , because they 're comparatively tractable . You can train a monkey to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself quiet in that position . If he 's reinforced with applesauce , he gets very skillful at do- ing this , very quickly . A stumptail is as good as a man at this trick , though he 's slower at the beginning , usually , to learn to do it . But if he 's poisoned with a drug , for instance , amphetamine , he gets shaky ? as do we . Another drug that makes him shaky is tremorine ; in fact , it produces a larger tremor like that of Parkinsonism . Drugs can be used to elucidate the nature of the phenomenon , to evaluate it . Some suppress , others reinforce , it . Then there is the question : If the motor part of the cortex is removed , how much would the operation impair muscular control ? We have n't analyzed that problem as yet ? we 're still on the pharmacological analysis . Obviously there are lesions that can mimic the symptoms of Parkinson 's , and when we know more , it might be possible to make a very early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For a time , I watched a complicated apparatus in which a rhesus monkey , gobbling applesauce , pressed buttons to get more and more of the sauce , while all the time an electrode in its cerebral cortex moved very slowly , searching as it were for a firing cell . The activity of the cell showed on an oscilloscope along with a record of the monkey 's eye movements . Above the oscilloscope was a large screen like that of a TV set , which showed an enlarged picture of the monkey 's hands busy with the buttons . He would continue to work , the investigators told me , until he had had his fill of applesauce . With my guide I paused as we went toward the elevator to look at a very large hamadryas baboon , the largest I had ever seen . " Beautiful , is n't he ? " said my companion . " He weighs about ninety-five pounds . - He 's on a high cholesterol diet as part of our studies of cholesterol transport and its involvement in certain types of cardiovascular disease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ R. Swindler presided over an office with crowded shelves and many diagrams . He is a research affiliate at the center and also a professor of anthropology at the university . He was working , he said , on an atlas of the comparative anatomy of man , baboons , and chimpanzees . " I 'm also sudying the dentition of all living primates from the tree shrew up , " he said . " New World primates have three premolars , therefore more teeth than Old World primates . Did you know that ? Old World primates , of course , have three molars but only two premolars , and so have we . Now , marmosets have lost their third molar , at least it 's very rarely seen in marmosets , but like other New World primates they still have their three premolars . I 'm computerizing all the data I have on dentition , so that I can define the parameters of variability in extant species . This information will help paleontologists to understand better the dental variability that existed in fossil specimens .  | I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plane to Spokane , where an outlying part of the Washington Primate Center is to be found at Medical Lake . I wondered at first why the center should have gone three hundred miles away for the necessary space on which to establish a field center : it 's not as if Seattle were like New York , I reflected . On the contrary , one of the city 's chief beauties is that there is plenty of space nearby . On the plane , however , Dr. Orville A. Smith , Jr. , the assistant director of the primate center , explained it all . " We were awfully lucky to get this place . It was built as a maximumsecurity prison for the criminally insane , as part of the Eastern Washington State Hospital , and I guess it was to soothe public sensibilities that they put it way off where it would n't scare people . The state must have spent millions on it . Then , soon after it was ready to open , tranquilizers were discovered . Bang ! " He struck his hands together . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such prisonlike restraint . It was dramatic , I can tell you . It was wonderful , a real blessing for humanity ? but there the hospital was with a brand-new prison on its hands that was no use to them . It would have cost too much even to pull it down . In the end it was handed over to us for a field station for breeding colonies of monkeys . Other colleges use it with us : we have arrangements with Eastern Washington State and a couple more . It 's been a godsend . " A car that met us at the airport took us straight to Medical Lake outside town ? a much prettier place than the name implies , with trees and quiet peace prevailing . We circumvented the mother hospital and drove a fair way inland until we arrived at the former prison . It did look like one , no doubt about it , with its concrete and the bare ground around it . " We 're going to do something about this , " Dr. Smith said , " just as soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animals outdoors . " A man in overalls met us and led us through high corridors in a brown sort of gloom ? not the man 's gloom , for he was cheerful ; it had something to do with the building itself , and the lights that did n't seem strong enough . Here and there walls were punctuated by metal-sheathed doors that had to be unlocked for us , not so much because there was need as that it was the only way the doors worked . After all , criminally insane prisoners .. . . " They had a system that locked everything at once , " Dr. Smith told me . " The guard would sit there , in that circle , and keep an eye on things . If anyone had escaped , the doors would have been shut automatically . Depressing , is n't it ? " Just then we walked past a row of little cubicles that stretched the whole length of one passage and opened out into it . Each had a high , small window , barred .  | " No more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except for the barred windows , " I said . " In fact , it 's a good deal like a school , but where are the pupils ? " " That 's just it ? we 've got so much room they 're hardly noticeable unless you go and track them down . " Dr. Smith lowered his voice . " This man , Jim , who 's taking us around ; he 's absolutely wonderful with baboons . He loves them : they 're his life . And to think that we 'd never have known it if we had n't decided to breed baboons as well as pigtails ! It was what you might call a hidden talent : he did n't know about it himself until the time came . " We were approaching familiar noises , and a smell I have grown to recognize , of a particularly pungent antiseptic . Turning a corner of the corridor we came to another row of cubicles that had been slightly altered ; they had barred doors and ? between each two ? a little runway at the bottom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There were floor drains , too . A group of pig-tailed macaques disported themselves in the first suite we stopped at ? at least a dozen of them , chasing each other , slipping through the hole into the other room and back again , and generally being very busy . " This is a breeding group , " said Dr. Smith proudly . " They seem to have taken to the life here , and they 're doing fine . We 've got another lot down here at the end , and over there are the baboons . Down on the next floor are crab-eating macaques ? and , of course , rhesus . " " Of course . " We peered at room after room . " It 's going to be a practical proposition . I 'm sure it is , " said the doctor . " We 've been working on the cost of breeding and it cheered us up a lot . Just think ; if you get a female pigtail from Asia and count everything in the way of expense ? initial cost , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animal will cost about six hundred dollars . Furthermore , you 'd know nothing about the infant 's pedigree . Now , when we 've got this place running to the limit of capability ? I figure we could take care of three thousand animals instead of the few hundred we have now ? well , barring accidents and acts of God , I figure that a pigtail infant from our breeding group , free of parasites and with known background , should n't cost more than two hundred and fifty . And we wo n't be depleting the wild . " In a nursery room a large number of prison-bred pigtail youngsters were playing on the floor , on plank perches , and up and down some shelves that had been put along the walls . All were more or less of an age , with one exception ? a large , brooding female who sat in the middle of the room with her arms full of infants . Other babies hung around her  | neck , crowded on her back , and plucked at her arms . She looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pillowed on her breast . " What on earth is that ? " I demanded of one of the caretakers . " Well , " he said , " she just has a talent for it , that 's all . Never had any of her own , but she looks after all the young ones and seems to like it , so we let her stay there . As a matter of fact , she 's a great help . "  | Beaverton , site of the Oregon Regional Primate Research Center , is so near Portland that in any less fortunate state it might long since have been engulfed by unlovely urban outskirts of that city . It is hard to spoil Oregon 's beauty , and certainly the center adds to it rather than detracts . The first of the Regional Primate Research Centers ? dedicated in May 1962 , two years after the initial grant was awarded ? it lies in a country setting , artfully landscaped , with plants and flowering shrubs lining the pathways that lead from one building to another ? as unlikely a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ African bush babies . Dr. William Montagna , the director , formerly professor of biology at Brown University , picked me up at the hotel to drive me out to Beaverton , and on the way talked at some length about cutaneous biology and baldness , related subjects that interest him professionally as well , no doubt , as personally ? for Dr. Montagna , tall and lean and full of vitality , is bald . " There 's one species of macaque , the stumptail , that becomes bald at adolescence . That 's a fact , " he informed me , deadpan . " Remind me to show you some at the center . Adolescent and adult animals show a receding hairline , and baldness progresses from there . You know studies of baldness interest a lot of people ? cosmetics people , for instance . We 've had grants to study it . " He talked of other things , too , such as the center 's unique collection of  | prosimians , which ? as the name suggests ? are animals a little lower than monkeys on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and bush-baby types . Beaverton 's collection represents all but the rarest of the true lemurs , which are found only in Madagascar ? or , as that country is now called , Malagasy ? and a large number of lemuroids from other countries . Dr. Montagna also talked of the center 's relations with Beaverton 's public ( good ) , and various projects on which the staff and visiting scientists are engaged . But when , that evening at the hotel , I read an issue of Primate News , the center 's house magazine , I was pleased to see that in a column called " From the Director 's Desk , " Dr. Montagna had reverted to his favorite subject , hair : I have for some time viewed with indulgent amusement the increasing number of men at the Center smitten by the revival of ancient hair styles he wrote . New beards appear daily , long sideburns and muttonchops are becoming paramount , and flowing hair will soon come . When I remarked about this to a colleague who sports fuzzy sideburns , he replied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be a more profound reason . Since only men can grow a beard and mustache , doing so is an assertion of masculinity . But here is a conundrum . Scalp hair , lush through adolescence , in most individuals becomes progressively anemic as the hair elsewhere on their bodies attains greater robustness . The same genetic factors that control the attainment of a hairy chin and chest also promote the enfeeblement of scalp hair as a man becomes progressively mature . For maximal expression of secondary male characteristics , then , I propose a new fashion : wear long beard and mustache , design clothing without a front , exposing one 's hairy chest to full advantage , and shave off all scalp hair . That will surely give the stamp of unquestionable vitality . . . . Dr. Montagna does not , however , spend all his time thinking and writing about hair . His latest publication , written in collaboration with Richard J. Harrison , professor of anatomy at Cambridge University , England , is a book entitled Man , the nature of which some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nature , " " Man 's Curiosity About His Anatomy , " and " What Kind of Creature ? " As to this last , the authors quote another doctor , George W. Corner , who said , " After all , if he is an ape he is the only ape that is debating what kind of ape he is . " Two features of the center that attract the layman 's eye are both , as it happens , Japanese in origin , though that is their sole similarity . One is the work of Joel Ito , who as a boy in Los Angeles studied zoology , later majored in art at the University of California , and then went on to take an M.S. in medical illustration . Few people in this country go in for medical illustration , and Ito had a wide choice of jobs . He chose the Oregon Primate Center . Now he leads a double life , professionally ; he makes  | strictly medical drawings but also produces portraits of primates in watercolor , carbon pencil , crayon , or etching ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of picture , medical and portrait , by Joel Ito hang on most of the center 's walls , and he has illustrated a 1970 calendar with a different primate for every month , which is one of my favorite souvenirs . The other feature I mentioned is the Japanese macaque colony living outdoors in a large corral on the center estate . This group was captured entire , just as it was living in the wild , complete with leaders , females , bachelors , children , and all . It was brought wholesale to Oregon , where the members continue doing whatever Japanese macaques do under the eyes ? sometimes aided by binoculars ? of spying behaviorists far above them in one or two observation rooms . They are creatures of habit , and have marked out their corral in definite areas : one where the young ones play , another for feeding , another for sunning , and so on . Dr. Bruce Alexander was watching them when I climbed up to an observation post , making notes on a chart as he did so . He pointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinguish individuals ? dominant males , for instance . " They do n't always behave quite as we expect them to , " he admitted , " and it may be that they 're altering their habits here . Females tend to squabble , and that 's natural enough , but in the wild when this happens , the male breaks it up , whereas here our males do n't do that very much . Japanese macaque males help to mother the babies , you know ; possibly this is n't true of the rhesus , I 'm not sure . The main structure of the group , though , resembles that of the rhesus and the baboon : it 's a family structure . You 'll see siblings defending each other and defending their mothers ? and vice versa , of course . One family here has two siblings that are n't related ? one of the infants was adopted ? but they behave exactly as if they were really in the same family . Though most youngsters in the same age group will defend each other if they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as with siblings . I should say that the strongest defense of all is that put up by a mother for her offspring . " He showed me several cages standing near the corral , which he said were being used for a certain type of experiment : they were putting groups of the macaques into small cages to see what crowded conditions did to their behavior . For one thing , he said , the troop structure held up very well in the crowd , even more than they had thought it might . It remained consistent . But individual males show increased aggression , sometimes even mobbing each other . Reducing the number of females to males , on the other hand , did n't seem to make the males any more shorttempered.  | Whether or not they behave the way they ought to , Oregon air seems to suit the Japanese monkeys , for they breed well enough to threaten a possible problem one of these-days of overpopulation . In the wild when a troop reaches the number of one hundred ? more or less ? it splits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ split-off group to another part of the forest . The Oregon colony at the time of my visit numbered eighty-four . " When they decide to divide up , where are the extra ones going ? " I asked . Dr. Alexander said , " We have n't figured that out . After all , they are n't yet at the fissionable stage . " " This has been a good year for Cutaneous Biology , " said the center progress report , so I investigated that department , where Dr. Mary Bell showed me pictures she had taken with the electron microscope of sebaceous glands in various primate species . These glands are often attached to the hair follicles ? in us as in other mammals ? and they supply the oily substance sebum that keeps hair from drying and falling out , or rather , from breaking off . In the first pictures Dr. Bell showed me the glands ? enormously magnified , of course ? that looked like lakes or peninsulas ; they were irregular areas surrounded by smaller details on the map of some mysterious country . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more highly magnified glands exhibited an amazingly regular pattern at certain places inside the boundary lines . These patterns , or grids , are structured elements called lysosomes . " Here 's one that looks like tweed , " said Dr. Bell , truthfully , " and here 's another that looks like crocodile skin . The most surprising thing we 've found out is that all these patterns are different . You get a variation for every species . Once you recognize one you can always be sure that it came from a certain animal . " In the Biochemistry Department I met Dr. Clarissa , Beatty and her associate Dr. Rose Mary Bocek , who were working on four major projects . They talked first about the metabolism of fetal muscle , which they were studying as part of a larger piece of work on muscular dystrophy . Dr. Beatty said they were focusing on the intermediary metabolism of carbohydrates and lipids ? fatty acids ? in fetal and newborn muscle , which nobody had investigated before . " We 're using the fetus of rhesus monkeys , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bocek . " We knew that a neonate uses lipids in the metabolism of its muscle , " said Dr. Beatty . " Now we 've gone further and found that the fetus , too ,  | utilizes fatty acid . In fact , it seems to use more in proportion to its weight than the adult does . The lipid is transmitted by the placenta to the fetus , just the way glucose is . We think it might be used for energy , though we have n't proved it . The assumption used to be that muscle utilized only carbohydrates , but we know now that it uses some protein as well . We 've also been looking at the effect of insulin on fetal muscle . As is well known , insulin has very much of an effect on carbohydrate metabolism in adults , but nobody had tried it out on fetal muscle until now . The results we 've been getting indicate that the fetal metabolism is responsive in the same way , and of course this is well worth knowing if it 's true . Our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work and more work , since we want to know the causes of weakness in voluntary muscles that is called muscular dystrophy . " Doctors Beatty and Bocek have been trying to induce this disease in monkeys . " Nobody 's succeeded so far , " said Dr. Beatty . " As you probably know , it 's sex-linked . Women are carriers , though often it 's not easy to see in them : you need blood tests to identify a carrier . A type of dystrophy has been developed in certain animals ? in chickens , mice , pigs , even cats ? but it 's not near enough the human kind to be much use . If only we could start it in primates , that would be so useful ! Their blood types are similar to ours ; they have heart attacks like ours , and strokes ; and they get viruses like ours ? many of our maladies . And their muscle structure is very much like ours . " She added that the Muscular Dystrophy Association was helping them on this research financially . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and " white muscle , " which meant nothing to me , and I asked what they meant . Dr. Beatty explained . " The voluntary muscles , which are the ones dystrophy destroys , are made up mostly of red fibers . White muscles are those that act quickly and tire quickly : they 're made of mixed red and white fibers . " " Think of a chicken , " said Dr. Bocek . " The drumstick is red muscle , and the breast is white . " " Simply comparing the metabolism of these two kinds of muscle leads one to a lot of new knowledge , " said Dr. Beatty , and both ladies smiled contentedly . After this conversation it seemed a natural transition to listen to Dr. Oscar Portman , of the Department of Primate Nutrition , on the subject of the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis . This disease is a phase of arteriosclerosis characterized by the deposition of a fatty , waxy substance on the inside walls of the arteries , so that the blood channels become progressively narrower ? choked up ? and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's a disease that starts very early in life , " said Dr. Portman . " People tend to think of it as an old-age symptom , not realizing that it 's really a pediatric disease , begun by the time the subject is in his teens . It does n't show in youth , but it 's there ? it 's there : it merely grows more severe as time goes on , and usually does n't show up until the third or fourth decade of human life . The idea that atherosclerosis might be connected with diet began with epidemiological studies during which it became obvious that certain races are prone to it and others are n't . I wo n't go into detail , but we can safely say that the Japanese peasantry , for instance , who eat sparingly of meat and subsist largely on rice and fish and pickle , suffer very little from atherosclerosis , and the same is true of the people of India , who also live on a spare diet . Atherosclerosis is a disease of prosperity ? underfed people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do exhibit at least the occasional case . Well , all this started us thinking that we should study certain aspects of diet and its effect in this respect on young nonhuman primates . We asked ourselves , What are the mechanisms that change the lipid composition of arteries with the approach of age ? " The word lipid means fat or fatty . Lipids of various kinds , with proteins and carbohydrates , are the principal components of living cells , and in the arteries of an ageing person afflicted with atherosclerosis they are present in a disproportionately large amount . One of the problems of studying the disease in a laboratory animal is that the research worker ca n't just sit down and wait for his subject to grow old , so Dr. Portman and his associates speeded up the process with diet . They were using two kinds of primate : rhesus and squirrel monkey . Twenty-four rhesus were fed from birth to the age of a year on various formula diets that are used for human babies . It was found that those animals fed on formulas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their blood than the ones fed on corn-oil formulas . " But none of them has yet developed atherosclerotic lesions , " said Dr. Portman . " We 'll have to wait . On the other hand , when we feed young squirrel monkeys an atherogenic diet ? that is , a diet rich in eggs and milk ? we find that this results in chemical changes in the arterial wall which we know are forerunners of the disease . These chemicals speed up the ageing process , and lipids , especially the phospholipids , tell a nice story as they undergo changes . To observe these changes we have several methods : for one thing we can strip the lining of the artery for microanalysis , but it is n't easy because a squirrel monkey 's so small his whole artery does n't give much material . " Everything considered , we think we can begin now to test methods of reversing the process , curing the developing atherosclerosis , . but how ?  | The obvious answer , using a corrected diet , has been tried , but as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is n't promising . " " If we had to depend on humans for trials of drugs to alleviate coronary atherosclerosis , we 'd need to dose ten thousand patients for five years with one drug , " said Dr. M. R. Malinow , chairman of the Department of Cardiovascular Surgery and associate professor of medicine at the university medical school . " Added to which we 'd need controls , of course ? at least five thousand of them . Quite apart from the dubious ethics of the exercise , we would spend thirty or forty thousand dollars a year during that time , which is why it is vitally necessary to use nonhuman animals in research ; it all goes much faster for far less expenditure . Now at last we have found a species that shows lesions ? the crab-eating macaque . Lesions develop after only three months on a special diet containing cholesterol , butter , and sugar . We have the species ; we have the method ; now we are trying out the drug . We are trying out a drug , that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on it as used on humans . If it has no effect on monkeys , doctors wo n't use it on humans , but if it alleviates the disease in the monkey , that will be different . " Muscular energy increases the degradation of cholesterol . This is not news . Exercise , taken in time , is good for you . We have seen the process in rats , who if they run , burn up more cholesterol , but we have not been sure what organ is responsible for this action . So I removed the liver from a rat ? the whole liver , you know , and that is not as simple an operation as it sounds : I had to go to the Mayo Clinic for the right equipment to do it . Afterward the rat was still able to increase the oxidation of cholesterol by exercise . Plainly , then , the liver was not the organ we sought . What other organ ? I made a guess ? an educated guess , I admit ? and removed the adrenals . And that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any more . Now , how does this work ? How do the adrenals know that the muscles are contracting ? There are two possible methods ? by electrical impulses through the nervous system , or by hormones . Almost certainly it 's not the nervous system , so it must be the hormones . But no known hormone is produced by the muscles . We are still working on this problem . " Hay-fever and asthma sufferers may have already heard of " the timothy hay treatment . " It was evolved at the Oregon Primate Center by Dr. Arthur Malley , of the center 's Department of Immunology , and Dr. Frank Perlman , chief of allergy studies at the University of Oregon Medical School . They used rhesus monkeys for their research . " ' There are some basic principles common to all allergies , " said Dr.  | Malley . " We study why an allergy develops , what sets it off , and how to prevent the reaction , which might be tissue damage or even death ? for death does occur in some cases . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treatment has been based on the fact that the patient must take the materials that cause the reaction in order to purify his system . I 've been working on this problem for thirteen years . Now we 've isolated a very small fragment of a molecule . This particular molecule , as it happens , is for grass pollens , but the principle that underlies the treatment is also applicable to many other substances . The fragment can combine with the irritating body and deactivate it . " Hitherto , treatment for hay-fever patients has consisted of injecting a pollen extract which produces blocking antibodies in the patient 's system and protects him against subsequent exposure to the irritant . The trouble with this method is that other antibodies called reagins , already present in the patient , react with the protein allergen in the pollen : this releases histamine and produces the hay-fever symptoms that we wish to avoid . In fact , an overdose of allergen may prove fatal . Thus , crude pollen extract must be administered in very small doses over a long period of time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patient gets any significant benefit from the treatment . We 've been using our fraction of a molecule for only three and a half years , and it seems to work . " People lose their antibody titers very soon a titer is a measure of the strength of a concentration : the titer drops early in the treatment and stays low for the rest of the time , which suggests that we are purging the patient 's body of the antibodies . In our trials , for six months , from August through January , none of the patients received treatment after the first series , but the reagin antibody levels remained at the same low points we had reached during the program . Patients who had become desensitized to timothy pollen did n't slip back into their allergic sensitivity . After six months they evidently began making the antibody again , so we resumed the treatment . Well , after three years some of them do n't begin again at all . A complete cure , then , is not impossible . " What might be even more important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the principle also applies to the chief difficulty encountered in organ transplants ? the rejection factor we have all heard of . This rejection is an immunological barrier , or in other words an antibody reaction , in which the antibodies automatically rush to defend the body against the foreign influence of the newly introduced transplant . To slow down these rejection phenomena , if not to prevent them entirely , surgeons have to use immuno-suppressive agents ? various chemicals such as immurand or cortisone , and these , when used for a long time at a stretch , have undesirable side effects . " I'he white blood cell count falls , and the patient 's  | resistance to infection is lowered to danger point . In Dr. Malley 's laboratory they have used rhesus white blood cells to isolate the specific antihuman lymphocyte antibodies from the other serum proteins , and have then administered this purified antibody to human patients suffering from autoimmune , or rejection , diseases . Indications are that this treatment eliminates the secondary complications one gets with nonpurified material . " Rhesus monkeys have been invaluable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their tissue reacts so much like ours , and they produce the same antibodies that cause allergies in humans . We could n't do the work with nonprimate animals . " " How does hay fever affect a rhesus ? " I asked . " Much as it affects people , " said Dr. Malley . " The monkey sneezes a lot and looks miserable . " Always suggestible and often allergic , I too sneezed , and wiped my eyes . Dr. Robert W. Goy and Dr. Charles H. Phoenix of the Department of Reproductive Physiology both started their careers as psychologists , the former at the University of Chicago and the latter at Boston University . After various posts they both went to the University of Kansas , where they met . In 1963 they came to the Oregon Primate Center . Now they work on hormonal studies and behavioral processes , which they consider a natural development of their interests . " For two years we 've been known as anatomists rather than psychologists , " said Dr. Goy cheerfully , " but the work we 've done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ definitive report was made on the behavior of animals that had been treated as fetuses with testosterone . In Kansas we did this study with guinea pigs and rats . The conclusions were provocative , but they were n't as well accepted by our colleagues as we would have liked . Still , we understood the reaction : it was reasonable . Guinea pigs and rats seemed remote from our own physiology . " About that time three people at Johns Hopkins were gathering information on the psychology of human hermaphrodites . The sex orientation of the subjects seemed to depend a lot on the way they 'd been reared ? that is , as male or female . And there was work being done on a certain type of habitual aborter ; if such a woman was given synthetic progesterone it sometimes helped ; presumably , then , her hormones were not normally balanced . Phoenix and I felt we must do more of our Kansas-type research , this time on species nearer to us ? on primates . We 'd watched Harlow 's remarkable work on the normal play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we felt that this might be the break we 'd been  | looking for . And Gertrude van Wagenen had been doing some pretty exceptional things ? she 'd given male hormones to young female monkeys , a treatment that had a profound effect on their morphology . " We took pregnant rhesus and injected the fetuses with a masculinizing hormone . Out of this we got eight infant females that show male features of various sorts . How does the hormone do it ? We have n't the definite answer , but in theory it works on the brain , somehow making some experiences rewarding and others not . Possibly there are centers in the brain that govern these reactions . We do n't see them as pinpoint places but as something broader . We do know , of course , in a large way , that there are reward centers ' and that the learning process depends on the reward system . " These hermaphrodite females of ours behave in many ways like males . They use the threat gesture far oftener than ordinary females , though not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ normal females mount sometimes , but infrequently , and they do n't adopt the truly male posture , but our females do . Their behavior in this respect is indistinguishable from that of males . " We learned in Kansas that a masculinized female rat never ovulates , which makes one ask oneself what difference there is between the male and the female brain that regulates this function . Humans when given androgen do ovulate . So do our monkeys , but there is one difference : normal female monkeys begin their menses at from twenty to twenty-six months of age , whereas these pseudo-hermaphrodites do n't begin until they are thirty-two months old . Evidently profound masculinization of the brain-pituitary-gonad axis does affect the clock . " One would expect that a different kind of hormone would have different effects . We have n't used as large a dosage on the monkeys as we did on the guinea pigs in any case , nor have we given them testosterone as yet , but soon we 're going to , after we 've ovariectomized them . So far the penis of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a castrated ' male ; we want to find out how much further they will develop masculine traits without ovaries and with intensive treatment of male hormones . " Incidentally , their body development does n't go along with their masculine nature , and with their characteristically small female stature combined with masculine behavior , they 're going , to be in trouble . Each animal is in a social group : they have girl friends and all that . If we could have formed a group with some normal males and females and a few pseudohermaphrodites , that would have been ideal , but we did n't have enough of them for that . As it is each animal is assigned to a certain group at birth ? it remains with its mother the first three months , then  | joins its social group for the next hundred days , where it is intensively studied . After that , it spends fifty days a year with the group , and the rest of the time is spent in various studies ? two pseudohermaphrodites together , and so on . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animal , so each of our pseudos is allowed to play with a number of other monkeys at a time . At these playtimes she is n't closely watched , but anything important is recorded ? big fights for instance , or changes of partners . Thus we have records on all the subjects , not only the pseudohermaphrodites but the others ? a large number of normal monkeys , all completely recorded . This kind of thing is invaluable . " The oldest of the pseudohermaphrodites is now eight . We have a pretty specific background on all of them , and this is of the utmost importance for psychiatric and psychological problems . With all this knowledge we can study many details of psychosexual behavior that were closed to us before . We have already noted a very gradual but decided development from pansexual both homo- and heterosexual to heterosexual behavior in normal males . One question we 'd like very much to get the answer to : it deals with autoerotic behavior . What does a rhesus mother do with her male infant to discourage autoeroticism ? Certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find out what it is . " In all we have about 150 animals ? that is , including normal and all . Now and then we have to add a few new groups to keep it up to strength . We ca n't afford to sacrifice the well-recorded animals . " ( Here I ) r . Goy was using the word " sacrifice " in its esoteric , laboratory connotation , meaning " to kill in order to examine . " I find it an expression fraught with guilt , but no doubt scientists have discovered that such euphemisms are necessary . ) " To avoid sacrificing them , " continued Dr. Goy , " we tend to shun electrode experiments on the brains of our pseudohermaphrodites ? though it would be nice to find out what 's going on there . After all , each of those animals is practically irreplaceable . Eight years ' work , observation , recording ? no , one could n't replace any one of them . " I remembered these words after I had left Beaverton and was reading the copy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the NIH headquarters in Bethesda . He had just heard that the Division of Research Resources , as part of the government 's much-heralded economy drive , proposed cutting the center budget for 1971 to a sum of $8.1 million to be spread among all seven centers . Dr. Montagna was appalled and dismayed . " Directors and Administrators of Primate Centers can not be dispassionate about these matters . . . . Each Center is threatened , and each must strive to survive against adversity and competition , " he said . " . . . We  | have concentrated on attaining the highest standards of research both technically and creatively and on organizing an administrative team that functions harmoniously and effectively . Since nearly all of our programs are interdisciplinary , scientists of different disciplines work together . . . . Reductions in financial support would force us to alter standards , reduce productivity , jeopardize irreplaceable animals , damage the morale of our staff and , therefore , probably lose it ? in short , reduce us to ineffectiveness . " Summing up , he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was insufficient to support seven Centers ; a reduction to $8.1 million in 1971 appears catastrophic . " Dr. Montagna therefore suggested , on the part of himself and his associates , a choice of several measures : to shut down four of the seven ; to let the NIH take over the operating costs of certain centers ? though this , he admitted , would be difficult ; or , finally , to return to the original concept of one Primate Research Center instead of seven . Dr. Montagna made no secret of which one he felt would be the best choice for this role . " The Oregon Center has attained maturity and world-wide scientific stature , " he said firmly . The New England Regional Primate Research Center ? I would be the last to blame those who refer to it as NERPRC ? is the youngest institution of the seven , having been dedicated in 1966 . It is also , I dare say , the hardest to find . Its address is Southborough , Massachusetts , but it is miles out in the country , disguised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public to hunt , or reminds one that one is on government land . All this , the staff assured me , had nothing to do with the center except that it was built where it was for that very reason ? it was on land already owned by Harvard University . No monkey is in danger of being shot . In fact , the center specializes in the smaller , more delicate primates , those that could n't live out of doors in the cold north , though the center hall features a handsome half-circular glass room in which hardy young rhesus and other macaques romp , leaping about from various pieces of equipment to the glass circumference , where sometimes they sit and stare for a while . " They 're quite an attraction , are n't they ? " said Dr. Derek DennyBrown , who during the director 's absence was doing the honors . " Yet I 'm sure the architect did n't intend it in that light : he was n't thinking of the place as a zoo . These monkeys do n't live here permanently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and this place serves as a sort of recreation room between times . " Leading the way to the reception room , he continued , " The center is  | hosted by Harvard , though five other nearby universities and colleges are interested as well . We have a lot of back-and-forth with the Harvard Medical School , but there 's also Tufts , Boston University , and so on ? in short , New England . I myself was formerly at the Harvard Medical School , and before that , collaborated with Sherrington on neurophysiological studies of nervous mechanisms and disorders of primates ? my chief interest is the nervous system . Our director , Dr. Bernard F. Trum , is another Harvard man , but he 's been in other places , too : he was chief of the Veterinary Section in Europe during the Second World War and later with the Atomic Energy Commission . " Coffee was brought . " As far as numbers are concerned we are n't one of the larger centers , " continued Dr. Denny-Brown . " We have only about seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the squirrel monkey , the saimiri : about one sixth our animals are saimiri . In spite of being so far north , by the way , we have a good breeding record for both rhesus and crab-eating macaques , but the New World monkeys do n't do so well : they never do . One hopes to find out why . I doubt if it 's the climate ? outside climate does n't make all that much difference nowadays , though one would expect it to have some bearing on one of the studies , which is to determine whether rhesus are seasonal in the strict sense of the word . Have they a seasonal sexual cycle ? Sometimes one is led to think so , when they produce their infants more or less all at the same time of year ; there is another possibility , however , that they can keep sperm in suspension until they 're ready to let the infant start growing . At any rate it seems to have little to do with the true climatic season . " We have a lot of visiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substantially out-number our core staff . Of course , there 's also the permanent veterinarian and service department ? probably the most important part of the center . Dr. T. C. Jones is our geneticist and Dr. R. Hunt , our pathologist . Dr. Arthur T. Hertig 's chairman of the Division of Pathol ) iology and has recently been working on the ovary of the squirrel monkey . What might interest you most about our work are several special subjects : study of chromosomes , viruses in some New World monkeys ? we 've recently found a few interesting things there ? and , in my own line ( which you can hardly expect me not to talk about ) , a genuine case of cerebral palsy in a rhesus infant born here . And I should mention a study that is being made on the development of vision in young monkeys . Perhaps you know what has been done with vision in cats ? If a newborn kitten 's eyes are sutured and kept closed for ten weeks and then opened , the kitten never sees well afterwards . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sight degenerates , nevertheless . We find the same reac- tions in monkey eyes , here and at the Harvard Medical School . Kittens , of course , are born with closed eyes , whereas primates are not , which makes a difference in the neonate primate 's reaction . " We visited Dr. Denny-Brown 's infant rhesus that was born with cerebral palsy . " You can see that it manages very well , considering , " said the doctor . The little creature 's hands and feet were crippled in a special manner , with fingers and toes clenched , but it moved about its cage nimbly , nevertheless . " It 's the only known case of cerebral palsy in a monkey , " said the doctor , " but that does n't mean , of course , that there have n't been others , only that an animal born like that in the wild would n't survive very long . " In the biochemistry laboratory they were working on phenylketonuria , one of the diseases that cause mental retardation in children . Though they are finding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England researchers are screening other species , hoping to widen the area of inquiry . Dr. Mathiah D. Daniel from Ceylon told me something about the work of his department , the Division of Microbiology . " We 've found several new viruses in South American monkeys , " said Dr. Daniel , " and one of them , at least , promises to be important . Three were found in the squirrel monkey : one is herpes T ; the second , herpes virus saimiri ; and the third , which has n't been named yet , was isolated from the squirrel monkey heart . " I recognized the word herpes . Like most of us I knew that herpes simplex is the organism responsible for fever blisters , and I had heard that it can be fatal to babies . Moreover , one should avoid getting any of the blister water in one 's eye as it can cause blindness . Then there is herpes zoster , more commonly known as shingles ? very nasty and painful . Monkeys , evidently , have even more trials with viruses than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new herpes virus in a marmoset , but we have n't had time to study it very much yet , " said Dr. Daniel . " The owl monkey has several viruses , some of which are herpes and others still unknown ? five or six have been isolated to date . Of all this lot , the most important seems likely to be the herpes virus saimiri , which was isolated here by our chairman , Dr. Luis V. Melendez , from a kidney-cell culture . This virus is a latent agent , that is , it seems'not to affect its host at all , but " ? Dr. Daniel spoke slowly and impressively at this point ? " it causes a fatal disease in the owl monkey and the marmoset . We do n't know as yet if owl monkeys and marmosets in the wild are affected by this organism which is carried by their close neighbor : we do know that in the lab- oratory it 's fatal to them . The disease is characterized as a malignant lymphoma , or cancer , and is the first instance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in another primate species has induced cancer . Some of our recent experiments seem to suggest a leukemic picture as well , but we ca n't say this with certainty : it 's still under observation . " The T virus , too , causes a fatal disease in both marmosets and owl monkeys , but it is n't cancer . It is , rather , similar to the encephalitis caused by herpes simplex in infants . The simplex and T viruses have no apparent relationship with each other except that both are viruses . Yet the lesions they cause are similar . We have been able to produce a vaccine against the T virus , to protect other animals against infection . " Owl monkeys can also be fatally affected , in both experimental and natural infection , by the herpes simplex virus : and we 've produced a vaccine against that , too . All in all , one can say we 're spending our time getting a clearer understanding of induced cancer in these species , and in characterizing all the new viruses that have been isolated from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Havana , trained as a veterinarian before he came to the United States , specializes in clinical laboratory medicine , but what he offered to show me was something other than medicine ? a very rare specimen , the surviving third of marmoset triplets . Marmosets , those tiny primates that do not seem monkeylike until one looks closely at their faces , have a faculty unusual in the primate world : they nearly always produce twin offspring ? and identical twins , at that . Dr. Garcia 's prize marmoset mother , however , went the others one better by producing triplets . As is often the case in multiple births the infants were undersized , possibly premature . Two of them soon died , but the other survived and was living in an incubator in the center nursery . I followed Dr. Garcia through this room , where two white-coated girls were feeding rhesus infants out of doll-sized nursing bottles , to the far wall where the incubator was . I have said that the marmoset babies were undersized . Keeping in mind that this particular species of marmoset @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ largest , you can possibly imagine how very tiny the infant was , but I was n't prepared for it , nevertheless . When Dr. Garcia lifted the lid , I blinked . All I could see for a moment was an expanse of white mattress with a small detail in one corner , something like a hairy black marble . Dr. Garcia very gently lifted the sheet that covered the rest of the animal , exposing its tiny , perfect monkey body , complete with tail . In all it was no bigger than a mouse . The head moved ; the minuscule eyes opened and looked at us , then closed ; the baby opened its mouth and squeaked . Softly Dr. Garcia covered it again and closed the incubator lid . We tiptoed away .  | The primate center at Davis , California , is special . Each center , of course , is not exactly like all the others , but Davis is special to a higher degree , and its difference is implicit in its name ? the National Center for Primate Biology , University of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ centers were authorized by Congress and their lines of research were blocked out , somebody commented that one important function had still to be catered for , since none of these centers could be expected to take care of animal husbandry in a way . What was needed , in the words of the Davis brochure , was facility dedicated to procurement , housing , breeding and manipulating of diverse species , and to interdisciplinary investigations of the broad bioligic features of these species . " Regional Primate Research Center language has a tendency to use mouth-filling words like that , but one soon catches on . At least , I did . " It was to be a conditioning center , " said the present director , Dr. Robert E. Stowell , more tersely . " The initial grant was voted in ' 62 and it opened in the fall of ' 65 , but it took a while to get off the ground . At that time I was elsewhere on the Davis campus . " Davis , not far from Sacramento in northern California , appeared to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such way-out animals as monkeys and apes ? a mild climate it which these exotic imports could live out of doors , plenty of space for a project  | that would call for at least three hundred acres , and men experienced in methods of animal production , for the University of California at Davis has five colleges of agriculture and veterinary medicine . The brochure lists five main objectives : ( I ) to develop methods for importing , conditioning , housing , handling , husbandry , breeding , and disease control of " substantial numbers of primate species ; ( 2 ) to study systematically the biology of the various species , presumably while there are still good large groups at hand , before they are scattered among the other centers ? these studies to be of all sorts , " ranging from morphological to behavioral in scope " ; ( 3 ) " to exploit the unique biologic characteristics of various subjects for solution of problems of concern to the human primates " ? though it might be argued that this is just what all the other centers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and test objects for investigators from national and international scientific communities which could not be carried out in their home institutions ; and ( 5 ) to furnish unique experimental subjects to workers outside the center . Such might include special breeding stock or animals with unusual metabolic qualities , or age . Of course , all or nearly all of the other six centers have breeding programs for the one or two species used extensively in their particular research problems , but the scope of the national center 's project outdoes any of these . At Davis the officials make a conscious effort to think of the primates flooding in from foreign parts in terms of herds , as if they were cattle or sheep . At first , I confess , I found it difficult to contemplate monkeys as breeding stock , but two days at Davis got me over this hurdle , and I slipped into the local way of thinking . The associate director , Dr. Lloyd J. Neurauter , has been associated with the primate centers almost from their beginning , having spent some time in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way from the airport he told me something of the Davis Center 's troubled early days , when disastrous epidemics attacked large numbers of the animals and for a while threatened to wipe out the entire subhuman primate population . " It was pretty bad , " he said . " Bad enough to make you wonder if it 's possible to keep large numbers of exotic animals at all . But of course it 's possible , once you know what dangers to look out for , and how to take precautions . A lot of our work is testing new animals that ordinary quarantine methods may fail to examine thoroughly . Old World primates have a lot of enteric infection and TB , of coui-se : we test all our animals regularly for TB , and test the humans who work with them as well . Pneumonia 's another of the common killers . And then there are the parasites : sometimes I think we 'll never learn everything we should about those . Two people at the center do nothing but study them . .  | " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different job from that of the man who takes care of domestic pets and farm animals . Laboratory workers here are also concerned with zoonoses , the diseases that humans can catch from subhuman primates . There 's been all that work on viruses since the Marburg deaths . We 're very careful nowadays . We were n't ever careless ? I did n't mean that ? but there were things we did n't know , and are learning about . " He slowed the car a little . " There 's Davis over there . You 'll see the primate center in a few minutes . . . . There . What does it remind you of ? " I replied promptly : " It looks like an African village . " It did , though I was uncertain about the material on the roofs of the huts . It should have been thatch , and it was n't . " That 's a new one , " said Dr. Neurauter , not displeased . " I thought you might spot them for what they are . They 're corncribs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high as you might be used to seeing " I do n't think I ever saw corncribs in Iowa , " I admitted . " Well then , that explains it , " he said . " To be precise , they 're half corncribs . It was our idea . We were wondering what kind of housing we could use for so many animals out of doors : cages cost , and we 're trying to hold expenses down . One day in Iowa we saw some corncribs , and it just came to us : We ordered a few right away to try out . Because they 're a lot higher than we need , we cut them in half ? we order twice the number of tops ? and that gave us two enclosures for every crib . I 'll show you how it works out later on . " We got out in the driveway of a large one-story building that , Dr. Neurauter said , was made of prefabricated materials . " It did n't cost anything like as much as those other buildings you 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't have the same weather problems , you see . Oh , it rains all right here ? we have as definite a rainy season as they have in the Congo , but cold snaps are the exception . When we get one , I admit we 're pretty busy running around improving the shelters . A freezing wind even at thirty-five degrees can be much colder than it sounds , especially when you have rain at the same time . Ever hear of the chill factor ? Just the same , it 's an uncommon kind of a problem and did n't justify a building in stone or brick . Here on our right is a field where we 've been growing a lot of our own food , alfalfa and such ; later we may have to build on it . Come on in . " I paused in the entrance hall to look at a display labelled : " Embryos and fetuses of macaque monkeys . Normal length of gestation about 24 weeks . " " We have displays like this for the benefit of the public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come and look at us : we have guided  | tours for classes and all that , and I arrange for little talks beforehand so they 'll know something about what they 're seeing . Kids today are surprisingly knowledgeable , you know ? they 're really interested . We have stuff for any number of displays , since it 's one of our functions to exchange material with scientists everywhere in the country . Nothing elaborate , you see ? that 's a burlap screen in the background . " The director , Dr. Stowell , received me in his office-cum-library . He said , " This is the largest primate colony in the country if not in the world ; and it 's probably going to be larger . At the moment we have more than two thousand animals , of nine different species . There are breeding colonies of eight species , which presumably is just the beginning . Some day we may have as many as twenty-five thousand animals , but that 's a very long-term project . By that time we 'll probably be using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read the outline of the program , I suppose . Our main objects are husbandry , reproduction and baseline studies such as blood chemistry norms , hemoglobin factors , parasites , bacterial diseases , reproductive physiology , menstrual cycles . . . . In addition , we provide animals for research , and visiting scientists can work here . We have quite a few now : a young veterinarian doctor , Kaye Smith , is studying an atypical tubercle bacillus that seems relatively new : she 's trying to find out where the animal got it . Possibly it came from domestic livestock here at Davis . This must be worked out . " We have the only breeding colony of Indian langurs that I know of , about fifty animals : they 're doing well and have twelve young ones born here . Dr. K. F. Meyer of San Francisco imported them to study plague , and handed them over to us to keep . Dr. Kilham has brought baboons from West Africa to study a feature peculiar to these particular animals : they are susceptible to light flashes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exposed . There are forty baboons in that troop , and very likely they 'll increase . " Two doctors from the NIH are studying slow-acting viruses which may produce disease after months or years . Perhaps such viruses are responsible for kuru ? a slow virus disease of the nervous system ? certain neurologic diseases , and Parkinson 's disease . They 're using a chimpanzee for the kuru tests , as well as squirrel monkeys . " In husbandry we investigate caging , housing , and care , trying to find the least expensive methods for these . Neurauter 's told you about our corncribs , which take an average of fifty animals each , but we also try other types of enclosures . We study how far apart these cages should be kept to avoid the spread of disease . We have to experiment with various types of base material , concrete , and so on . We must also explore various  | devices for shelter and entertainment . Monkeys are like people : they 're not all alike . Some need one type of shelter , some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 've refurbished the indoor cages and replaced a lot of the older facilities , the operating room and so on . " We 're also rebuilding the staff . When Leon Schmidt left two years ago , a lot of people left with him . The University of California came to our rescue when everything looked at its darkest : they advanced funds which we can pay back in several years . We get money from other sources , too ? research agencies that ask us to raise and keep animals for them , that kind of thing . On the campus we have a program in the medical school financed by the NIH . That 's where I was initially ? the medical school , where I was chairman of the Department of Pathology . I 'm still a professor there . " " A lot of questions have to be answered when you try to domesticate wild animals , " said Dr. Neurauter , " but I do n't see why it ca n't be accomplished , in controlled conditions . . . . We should go in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pigs and the others . We need to identify the monkey as the ideal animal for research , but first we should decide on the species that would answer our purposes best ? the all-purpose primate . If we could only miniaturize the chimpanzee , that would be the ideal animal . " I looked at him wonderingly . No , he meant it . I thought of the time it would take to miniaturize a chimpanzee , and felt a little dizzy . Poodles , yes : chimps , no , I felt . " There 's no question but that they 're valuable , even as they are , to space flight , " he said dreamily . We entered the center lecture room where a high school class was waiting to be indoctrinated . I took my seat with the youngsters and listened . Dr. Neurauter 's talk impressed me : it was matter-of-fact and not patronizing . " We all recognize the fact that primates are closely related to us , " he began easily , " more closely than the armadillo , for instance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the animals before returning to the buildings and laboratories , where one doctor said to me earnestly , " Problems with the primate in captivity are different . They have hands . They 're manipulative , and they 're clever . ' Their relationships and social structures are very important in their lives , which is why we seem to spend so much time on behavior . I know the world outside thinks we do too much on behavior ? somebody said the other day that primatology is overstocked with Harlows , but it 's not true : we are n't wasting time . You ca n't handle an animal in captivity unless you know how he behaves in the wild , and monkeys are too intelligent to  | fool . Usually they catch on to things quicker than the animal handlers . " In a final conversation , Dr. Stowell said , " Sometimes I wonder why we do n't concentrate on three species for research ? for instance , the rhesus , the baboon , and the bonnet . We could really raise them on ranches then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conservationists . On second thought , no substitute would do for the chimpanzee , I suppose , and then there are all these new things they 're finding out about the New World monkeys . . . . He sighed , like one relinquishing a dream . " The others for the most part are arboreal and hard to keep . Of course , in a way we too are conservationists , but that 's not our main job . I 'm tempted to say , Let 's leave the dusky langur alone ! " The Delta Regional Primate Research Center is connected with Tulane University in New Orleans , but one would never guess it , for it is some forty miles from the campus , across the causeway , near the town of Covington . Delta does a good deal of work on infectious diseases , and it was considered wisest to put it where it is . Deep in the country , set in some of the prettiest landscape in the United States , it looks at first like an outsize country house . Indoors , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The last time I visited the office of the director , Dr. Arthur J. Riopelle , I saw something new in the way of decoration ? a large ape doll , obviously a replica of a famous albino lowland gorilla in the zoo at Barcelona . Copite de Nieve , or Little Snowflake , is the albino 's unlikely name , which probably did n't seem so unlikely back in 1866 , when Copi was an appealing two-year-old in the Rio Muni forest of Spanish Equatorial Guinea . He was captured when his mother , an ordinary black animal , was killed by a hunter . He has typical albino coloring ? white hair , pink skin , and blue eyes ? and the doll in Dr. Riopelle 's office had the same . I assumed , correctly , it was a Barcelona toy . " Who chewed off its nose ? " I asked . Dr. Riopelle said , " Copi himself did that . A couple of us go over to Barcelona every year to see him , measure him and all that , and this time we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cage mate , an ordinary black female gorilla slightly younger than himself , but the fascinating thing about him when we handed him this doll was that he reacted to it in quite a different way than he does with his playmate . He'recognized it as something like himself . He grabbed it right away and even reacted sexually . Naturally he 's seen himself more than once in a mirror , so I suppose it 's not as remarkable as it seems . Just the same . . . . " We discussed the latest developments at Delta : Dr. Oscar Felsenfeld , he  | told me , working on enteric diseases and generalized infections , had been applying the knowledge he gained to that scourge of most parents , infant diarrhea . " He 's had a lot of experience with enteric diseases and tropical medicine generally in the Far East , " said Dr. Riopelle . " He used to be director of the SEATO medical laboratory . One of the things he 's particularly interested in is cholera . We ca n't be too careful of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ migrate through the Middle East and happen here . His wife , a Thai girl , is a virologist : she 's working on infectious hepatitis . Then there 's Tom Orihel , who 's engaged in parasitological studies , especially filariasis . Did you know that can be tied in with heartworm in dogs ? " They had six wild-born chimpanzees , he said , all having been inoculated with hepatitis material and all being studied . Counting the healthy animals , they had sixty to sixty-five chimps . Yerkes and Delta are the only two centers with equipment that makes it possible to keep so many great apes as well as the more usual monkeys . Dr. Riopelle continued : " Kenneth Brizzee is working on the effects of low-level radiation in the susceptibility of brain cells to further radiation ; we 're hoping this will lead to the development of more radioprotective drugs . And a young couple are here from Taiwan : they 're studying how blood components react in response to ageing and disease . " We 've got a group in reproductive biology busy on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ otherwise of a small African monkey , the talapoin , for research of this sort . They 're trying out a uterine device on that monkey ? perhaps you know that the trouble with these devices is that they might slip out . The hope is that if they 're coated with a certain hormone , they wo n't slip . Harold Spies is working on neural control of reproduction and reproductive behavior , and L. E. Franklin is investigating the morphological changes that occur when the sperm first comes into contact with the ovum . This is a very critical period in the life-span of an individual . We do n't know to what extent developmental disorders start at this moment , when something might easily go wrong . Usually if things do go wrong , you do n't get a successful take ? but if you do , the resulting animal might be badly affected . Also , if you learn enough about the process , you might develop a different contraceptive technique which does n't involve steroids : a lot of people have doubts about steroids because they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We do n't know nearly enough about reproduction in primates . When I was at Orange Park we had a female chimp about forty years old who had gone ten years without seeing a male animal close up . She was still cycling , so one day I tried an experiment : I opened the cage door so a  | male could get in , and in ten seconds that chimp was pregnant . I almost lost my head over that , " he added thoughtfully . " And it ties in with something else we ought to do a lot more of ? studies of old age . At Orange Park we were actually criticized for doing the small amount we did : it was said that we were running a hotel for ancient apes . Well , why not ? The only data we 've got on old age in primates is from those ancient apes : we had continuity , which you do n't get nowadays . Most grants are for short periods ? three to five years ? with the result that instead of good solid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studies in neat little packages that are small good to anybody . " Charles M. Rogers and I once did a complicated study on the performance of aged apes ; we found out a lot , but that was in the days of Orange Park . In our original chimp study here we hoped to follow animals through their whole life-span , but then came the financial squeeze . Animals now are systematically set aside when the project is discontinued every five years , perhaps only to be cranked up again in another five years ? starting all over again . I guess an old-age study or a life-span study , if it 's done right , takes an endowment kind of commitment . " On my first visit to Delta I had been taken by Dr. Emil W. Menzel , Jr. , research associate and associate professor of psychology , to watch a group of five-year-old chimpanzees . Every day they played for a while in a field cage about an acre in size , in which stood trees ? which soon , under their treatment , became stripped , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were six in number , and though they appeared to me to be a single group , they were really , Dr. Menzel explained , two groups of three and two , and one free floater . The trio were Shadow , Belle , and Bandit ; the pair were Libi and Bido ; and the free floater , an expression that will be explained in a moment , was Polly . That day Dr. Menzel , an assistant , and I stood on the observation platform and watched the chimps run out as soon as the door to their cage was released . The assistant held a timer that gave a signal at fixed intervals . Each time we heard the signal Dr. Menzel dictated a commentary on what the animals were doing . Two might be walking together , " tandem , " arms around each other 's waists or leaning on each other 's shoulders ; or one might wrestle with another or play follow-my-leader . The point was that no matter what they did they never got very far apart from each other . Dr. Menzel took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much the same history ? in each , that is , the members had been living together for a considerable time , varying from three months to two and a half years . Neither group , however , had had any experience  | with the other until the whole lot were put together in a one-acre field cage and housed there permanently . Dr. Menzel wrote , " The basic problem of the research was : What constitutes a ' social group , ' and what holds an entire aggregate of chimps together in space across time , or causes it to separate into smaller parties ? . . . Initial tests and continued base-line data on patterns of group travel and social interaction , dearly showed that the subjects quickly came to travel together as a single aggregate , and to interact freely with any other animal . However , any given subject 's primary associations were with members of the original ' natal groups . ' " At night the subgroups invariably separated to sleep in different locations . Shadow , Bandit , and Belle , who had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cage ; Libi and Bido , who had been raised as a pair , slept in another hutch ; and Polly , who had spent several months before the experiment living with Libi and Bido , but before that had been rotated from one housing situation to another , living alternately alone and with different companions , usually slept alone in a third cage . If disturbed at night , however , Polly often left her cage to join one of the other parties . " During the day , even after 1 year , subjects seldom ranged farther than moo ft. from an old companion , and when the entire aggregate spread out over a substantial area , with no one in direct physical contact , old companions usually followed each other and stayed closer to each other than to any other subject . The typical pattern of travel , especially through open areas or when subjects were cautious , was ' tandem walking , ' with old companions holding each other about the waist and walking in a chain ? usually in the same orders within the chain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When fights developed between a pair of subjects , all animals usually came running to the scene , and each then ' took sides ' with the member of his subgroup . The only subject whose affiliations wavered or fluctuated over the period of a year was Polly . " Oh , yes , Polly , the free floater . On the day of my visit Dr. Menzel 's dictation went something like this : " Bandit climbing , followed by Shadow and Belle . Libi and Bido tandem . Polly about thirty feet to the rear . " Bandit and Belle tandem , Shadow behind . Libi and Bido climbing . Polly thirty feet to the left . " Libi and Bido tandem , Bandit chasing Polly . . . . " It went on for about an hour before I said , " Dr. Menzel , I think I 'd better go now . I know you 'll think it silly of me , but I ca n't help identifying with Polly . "  | A year and a half later , I learned that Dr. Menzel had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had written a paper about it . " One of the basic reasons that group members separate is presumably to reach spatially separated ecological goals , " he wrote . " A series of experiments was therefore conducted using a wide range of usually attractive objects ? novel toys , household articles , trees , people , etc . All 6 subjects were confined in a release cage before a trial began , and 2 or more objects were placed out in the field at a distance from this point . Then the cage door was opened and subjects were free to respond . " He discovered that the six animals rarely split into parties to approach two objects at once , even when the objects were only fifty feet apart . Instead , they worked as a single unit , going first to one of the objects and then to the other . Later , getting used to the game , they took such objects as they could carry to " a common preferred location , " where they did begin to split up to some extent . " Old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away . " Even so , unless he was chased , no subject went more than twenty feet from the others to hang on to an object , and " this close aggregation of animals and desirable objects occasionally led to fights between entire sub-groups . " They tried the chimpanzees with food prizes as well as toys . It has been said by other chimpanzee watchers that food seems to be " a uniquely important class of objects for increasing population dispersions , " but Menzel noticed that his " well-fed juveniles , " once they had reached their goal , fought harder for toys than for food . " Very few fights occurred over , food . . . . Much more common responses to losing a race were clinging to the victor , begging for food , initiating social play , or grabbing the food stake and wrestling , mounting , and thrusting on it . " Again , even when the group split it was only for a minute . As soon as they had grabbed the prizes they got together again . " Apparently chimp groups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happen to be going to the same goals ; there are also forces of some sort that pull them back together once they chance to separate . " In later tests , when the apes were older , their habits changed to some extent . Six supplies of food were exhibited in different locations , the situation always visible to all the group . Sometimes four lots of food were put on one side and two on the other , sometimes five to one , and so on . Except when all the food stakes were on one side , the group almost always split ? but always with a neat division , more chimps going to the larger collection . They seemed able to sum up the situation literally at a glance and as one chimp . " About the only discrepancy in these data , " says Dr. Menzel , " was produced by a single chimp , Bandit , . who rarely  | competed for distant food , but frequently begged or stole it from the successful . " Polly seems to have become integrated . Later , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a report as a lecture in Boston . I read the paper before going to Delta for the last time . He began , " My general problem is , where will a chimpanzee be next , and why does he go there rather than elsewhere ? The preliminary answer to this is simple : A chimpanzee will generally be where his close companions are . Indeed , if we knew the minute-to-minute location of a social group 's center , we could account for at least 90 percent of any given individual 's movements over the course of a day . The question that immediately arises is , Where will the ' group as a whole ' be next ? What controls its location , its general direction of travel , and the moment-tomoment scatter of individuals about the group center ? " To answer these questions he devised a game . The chimps were locked up where they could n't see the field , while Dr. Menzel and his associate hid food under a pile of leaves and grass or behind a tree . Then Dr. Menzel took out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " for the purposes of the game , and carried it to where the food was hidden . He showed the food to the chimp but did n't let him have any , then carried him back and reunited him with the group before releasing the whole lot of them . The leader tried to persuade the others to follow him to the food . If nobody followed him , he got very upset . " He would go from one follower to the next , grimacing , tapping him on the shoulder , starting off tentatively and then stopping to glance backward , or ( in the extreme case ) screaming , grabbing a preferred companion and physically dragging him in the direction of the food . Once the followers followed , however , the leader soon turned his companion loose and ran ? and this usually produced a pack race . All this , of course , suggests that group cohesion was strong and the ' leader ' was as dependent upon the group for getting to the food as they were dependent on him in knowing precisely where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men showed the leader the food secretly , as they had done before , but after returning him to the group , they released him again without the others , keeping them in the cage . Phis gave him a chance to go and get the whole lot of food for himself , but did he take that chance ? No . He whimpered , defecated , begged , and even tried to open the cage door himself to release his friends . When Bandit was leader , he had a tantrum at such times , screaming and rolling on the ground , then running and clinging to a tree . ( Three times , it is true , when Belle was leader she ran and got the food for herself , but only when it was hidden very near to the cage . ) Once the door of the cage was  | opened , the leader 's behavior changed rapidly . He " ran to a follower , screamed and embraced him , and within five seconds was off and running for the food . " The men were much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a different goal , were able somehow to communicate to each other the relative value of these food caches , so that the whole mob would go first to the bigger lot and then to the lesser . Dr. Menzel asked himself how this was brought about . What did each leader do that changed the behavior of the other leader and of the followers ? He had seen many instances of behavior on the part of the leaders that would interest those who study primate communication ? " For example , glancing back and forth between the goal and the followers , arm signals , ' presenting ' the back to get another animal to walk in tandem , whimpering , and tapping a follower 's shoulder or tugging his arm , occurred fairly frequently . " But these signals were seldom very effective , and they did n't happen often enough to explain all the data . Dr. Menzel observed that the best strategy a leader could use to attract followers was to get up and move off independently in a consistent direction . He thought that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the right place was not some special form of chimp language , but the general tendency of any individual to run faster , go in a straighter line , and ignore other goals such as companionship ? or , for that matter , to pull harder , whimper louder , or gesticulate more vigorously . There is also , he said , the ability of chimps , or most mammalian species for that matter , to use another animal 's behavior as a cue that something is out there ' in the environment . Having read Dr. Menzel 's papers since earlier visits to the center , I was eager to see the chimps again , so he took me to the field . As we approached the fence , the apes came tumbling up from all directions to get a closer look . Then , as if satisfied , they returned to their former pursuits . " They have grown , " I commented . " They do n't act at all the same . " " Far more independent now , " agreed Dr. Menzel . The chimps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one behaving with such assurance that it was hard to believe he had ever clung constantly to a companion , or made only tentative , fearful steps toward the center of the area . One of them ? Bido , I think Dr. Menzel said it was ? picked up a small plank , balanced it in the air , and brought it to the wire fence near us , where he began trying , with great patience , to wedge one end into an opening . " Still , they do n't readily separate very great distances , you 'll notice , " the doctor said . Ahead of us , one of the dead trees showed an interesting pattern to which he called my attention ? a pair of muddy footprints that went  | straight up the side of it . " A stranger would have nightmares trying to figure that out , " he said . Bido had succeeded in wedging the end of the plank into the fence : now he had a rising ramp that led , evidently , nowhere except straight through the fence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I clapped . " They 've begun doing something new , " said Dr. Menzel . " You remember what Jane Goodall saw chimps doing in the wild ? " He was referring to a young woman who had lived for extended periods of time in East Africa near one particular band of wild chimpanzees , watching their behavior and finding out a good deal that was new to anthropologists . " They trimmed twigs and stuck them into termite nests and all that , and the termites collected on the twigs and the chimps ate them , " Dr. Menzel reminded me . " Yes , I remember , " I said . " Well , " said the doctor , " the chimps are doing that here . Not that we have any termites , of course , and the ants are inedible : the chimps never eat them . Just the same , now and then I see a twig sticking up in an ant hole . "  | mies do their thing a bit better than chimpanzees ? that is all . They build temporary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are differences : A pygmy house Stands on the ground and is complete , with a roof made , like the walls , of plantain leaves , whereas a chimpanzee nest is usually up in a tree , and it has no roof . Pygmies can talk our language when they try to . It is a moot point whether chimps can talk at all : certainly very few have ever tried . Pygmies are accomplished hunters , stalking and bringing down elephants , but those few chimpanzees that are known to catch animals go after very small game , in a primitive slapdash manner at that . There are lots of such differences . Nevertheless , if Herodotus made a mistake , we should not wonder at it , even though in the intervening centuries we have become fairly sophisticated about apes . Probably the first person to mention these animals ( after Herodotus , that is ) was the English sailor Andrew Battell , whose account was given to Samuel Purchas in 1613 and subsequently published in the book " Purchas His Pilgrimes . " Battell had been kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tells of the Angolan province of Mayombe on the coast , " where the woods are so covered with baboons , monkeys , apes and parrots that it will fear any man to travel in them alone . " Among these creatures were two monsters , common there and very dangerous ? one enormous monster called Pongo , obviously a gorilla , and a slightly lesser one , Engeco , which must have been a chimpanzee . The word chimpanzee itself derives from an Angolan dialect , and means " mock man . " In 1641 an Amsterdam physician and anatomist , Claes Pieterszoon Tulp , published a work , Medical Observations , illustrated by at least two anatomical drawings ? of the narwhal and the chimpanzee . His model for the latter was an animal owned by the Prince of Orange , and it was possibly the first living specimen ever to reach Europe . Afterward more chimpanzees arrived ; not many at first , and they did not survive more than a season , but as long as they lasted they attracted fascinated attention . If for years few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this in a way was the ape 's own fault . To watch the animal make himself at home in houses , to teach him to behave like a human being , was so amusing that it distracted the watchers and led them away from the spirit of inquiry . Men made copious notes of chimpanzee behavior , but they were all of how chimps acted in our world , not in their own . Even today performing chimpanzees are a sure-fire attraction in the circus , on stage , in TV shows , and even as night-club acts : people never seem to tire of watching the animals prove that they can eat at table , ride tricycles , and rollerskate . The only information past generations gleaned about chimpanzee behavior ? with the honorable exception of Richard L. Garner , who went to Africa in tgoo to watch primates ? came out of  | stories told by Africans to gullible travelers . Then , early in the 1920 'S , Dr. Robert Mearns Yerkes at last took action . In addition to establishing a breeding colony of chimpanzees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ species could be studied in its natural habitat . There was potential competition for his venture . When scientists at Pastoria ? the laboratory complex at Kindia in French Guinea ? needed a chimpanzee all they had to do was step outdoors and catch one . Yerkes felt he ought to have a look at the station , though as he explains in his foreword to a monograph by his assistant Henry W. Nissen , " A Field Study of Chimpanzees , " published in 1931 , he was n't really worried . The French scientists were n't interested in psychobiology , but in medicine . He wanted to see their equipment and methods , and he still hoped to do fieldwork , but for some years after Pastoria began operating , he was unable to get away from Orange Park . Then in 1927 he heard that the Russians , too , were starting a primate center , at Sukhumi on the Black Sea , and he resolved to visit both places . In 1929 , in the summer , Yerkes got to Kindia at last . He had the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ financial help from America for their Kindia project , and Yerkes had been requested by officials of the Rockefeller Foundation to take a good look at the setup and give them a written report on his return . The French cordially agreed to his proposal that someone from the Yale Laboratories of Comparative Psychobiology come to French Guinea and make a systematic study of the life of the wild chimpanzee , also to bring back to America a group of young chimps for Orange Park . In December , therefore , after Yerkes came home , Henry Nissen set sail in his turn for Conakry . There he spent two and a half months on fieldwork ? not much considering it was the first expedition of its kind , but he was supposed to make a preliminary survey only . The literature on chimpanzees is full of valiant attempts to sort out various subspecies . Early observers in the very young study of primatology made divisions based on all sorts of features ? the color of the animal 's face ( for some chimpanzee faces are black , some pink , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which sometimes is reddish rather than black ; the thickness of hair growth ; and the baldness or lack of it on the head . But these variations often prove to be individual , not specific , and today 's primatologists have more or less agreed to recognize only four , or possibly three , main types : Pan troglodytes troglodytes , Pan t. verus , Pan t. schweinfurthii , and ? perhaps ? Pan t. paniscus . The last named may in fact be a separate species , in which case it would be Pan paniscus . It is the pygmy chimpanzee . Nissen 's animals were Pan t. verus . He selected for the survey an area about twelve and a half miles in di- ameter , the center about nineteen miles from Kindia . The chimpanzees of the region had often been raided by men collecting for Pastoria , but Nissen reasoned that Africans had long hunted them in any case , for meat , and he could only hope the local animals were not too badly demoralized . The fieldwork began in February 1930 in the middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than twelve hours of rain the whole time he was there . The heat was " oppressive and fatiguing " ; one needed constant protection against sunstroke , he wrote , but the natives did n't seem to mind it ? not as much , apparently , as the chimps did . It was a hilly country with narrow streams . Patches of lush vegetation were interspersed with grass that grew up to five feet and burned dry and brittle in the summer . There were no guides on how to watch chimpanzees , so Nissen started out in the conventional way of the naturalist , by constructing a few blinds . He wasted two days sitting in them , for he never saw an ape the whole time . He concluded that they were too alert to be fooled in this way . Also , using a blind depends on the habits of one 's object , the daily routine of the animal , and as Nissen was to discover , there was nothing regular about chimpanzees . They might congregate in one clearing for three days , eating fruit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they would move on to another feeding ground . The easiest way to locate them was to listen , since on the road the animals made a lot of noise , yelling and drumming . The drumming they did by hitting hollow trunks or tree buttresses hard and rhythmically ? it often sounded , he said , like tomtoms , and could be heard a very long way off . Nissen did better , he found , when he left his Africans behind and tried to get close to the apes , at least close enough to see them with binoculars . Once or twice he succeeded in approaching to within fifteen or twenty feet , but most of his observations were made from at least fifty feet away . The most satisfactory method was to send out scouts in the evening to discover where a group had gone to bed , and next morning he would be there before they woke up , to follow them as long as he could . Twice he stayed all night near a sleeping party . By examining feces , he learned a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ variety of leaves and fruits ; he never saw them eat anything else . He was able to confirm that chimpanzees were highly socialized and almost invariably lived in bands or groups which some people called " families . " Nissen would not call them families , arguing reasonably that he had no way of knowing what relation they bore to each other . The smallest group he saw consisted of four members , the largest of fourteen , but on two occasions he saw groups together in a sort of mixer , or  | combination party , when they numbered sixteen and eighteen respectively . " It is gospel among the natives , " he wrote , " that a chimpanzee group consists of the male leader , his wives and his children . The family of the French Guinea negro is thus constituted , which makes it probable that his observations of the apes are strongly tainted by anthropomorphic interpretation . " In fact , he continued , six times he had seen groups containing not one but two mature males , and though they might represent father-son relationships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were possible . Perhaps neither male nor female chimpanzee is limited to a single mate , even temporarily , he speculated ; and later studies made by others were to prove him right . At dusk the chimpanzees made nests to sleep in , collecting branches and weaving them together in the trees where they elected to spend the night , filling the shallow depression in the middle of the arrangement with twigs and leaves stamped on and patted until they offered a smooth surface . Members of a group built their nests close together , all in one tree or at least in nearby trees , at a height of from 13 to 105 feet . Nissen took several nests apart , knowing they would not be missed , since as far as he could see no animal used the same nest twice . He found that a typical nest was almost flat , with practically no sides . It was oval in shape , nearly round . One that he examined was twenty by eighteen inches across . Most of the branches that made up the base had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the inside was very smooth . Reading this part of the report put me into reminiscent mood . It was strange , I reflected , that I too should have been dealing with a chimpanzee in Africa in that same year of 1931 , though I was on the other side of the continent , in the Belgian Congo . Chimpo was not wild , but she was not captive either , and once she too built a nest , in a tall tree near my front door . The tree was an ironwood and looked like a giant feather duster , with no branches on the way up , but then , high in the air , a burst of them thick with twigs and leaves . I do n't know why Chimpo suddenly made that nest , or rather why she had never done it before ; perhaps it was because she had always been put to bed in the house when dark fell , and never had the chance . At any rate the impulse took her at high noon that day . An hour or so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard a familiar sound , to which at first I paid no attention . Why should n't a goat bleat ? But my subconscious plucked my elbow and said insistently , " Goats do n't fly , goats do n't Hy , " until I put down the book and really listened . Sure enough , the noise was coming from an unusual angle . I went out into the  | yard to look , and there , peering anxiously down from high in the tree , was a goat standing in the chimpanzee 's new nest . It is hard to describe how strange he looked up ' there . Having carried him up and deposited him , Chimpo was no longer with him : she had become bored and gone away on some other project . It took us all afternoon and three ladders tied together to get the goat down . Nissen discovered that some of the chimps , especially the larger ones , took a siesta in the middle of the day , in branches or crotches of shady trees or , more often , on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afternoon naps , but sometimes an ape would pull bush grass down , or use small bushes or little trees to make the ground softer . Nissen called such places daybeds . Some of them were fitted with roofs or sun umbrellas , made of young saplings twisted so that they bent over and shaded the reclining animal . He found six of these elegant arrangements , all near the margins of woods and open fields : in the forest chimpanzees needed no protection from the sun . As long as you went about your own business , he discovered , chimpanzees did n't mind your being about somewhere . It was only when they thought you were paying attention to them that they ran away . " In one instance I observed chimpanzees feeding in a tree not more than 250 feet from where a dozen native women were noisily washing clothes , talking and laughing , " he wrote . " The women paid no attention to the animals and the latter seemed totally unconcerned about the women . But if chimpanzees caught us looking at them from much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Although my relatively short stay in the bush of French Guinea resulted in the accumulation of more factual material than I had dared to anticipate , the story of the chimpanzee in his native habitat has only been started , " he wrote in conclusion . " . . . The major share of the task remains to be done . That it needs to be done by thoroughly trained observers is obvious . That it is very much worthwhile doing , I think is equally clear . " Yerkes hoped to send a full-dress expedition to Africa soon after the monograph appeared , but the times were against him . First there was the great depression , then the Second World War and its subsequent upheavals . It was not until 1960 that a second scientific observation was made of chimpanzees in the wild , and the man who undertook this task was not a Yerkes scientist , but the Dutch Dr. Adriaan Kortlandt , who went to Africa under the sponsorship of the Institute of National Parks of what was then ? as he says ? the Belgian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years later . The situation had changed noticeably dur- ing the three decades that had passed . In many areas the apes , because of their value as laboratory subjects , had been hunted to extinction , or at least had moved out of the range of observation . The region selected by Dr. Kortlandt lies in that part of Africa where such chimpanzees as survive belong to another subspecies than those of Nissen 's experience : these are Pan t. schweinfurthii . He located himself at the edge of a fruit plantation in the eastern Congo . The plantation 's Belgian owner did not grudge the chimps the papaws and bananas they took : it amounted to little compared with the full yield . The apes ' favorite sleeping place was a wooded hill just at the edge of the clearing : it was protected from human marauders by the local legend that trespassers who harmed the animals would be destroyed by the spirits that lived there . Moreover , the natives believed that chimpanzees could catch any spear thrown at them and throw it back with deadly effect . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a chimpanzee heaven . Dr. Kortlandt prepared a number of blinds , and had better luck with his than Nissen had thirty years earlier . One was twenty feet up a giant tree at the bottom of the hill , just where the chimpanzee trail led from the woods into the clearing . Two more were placed at the side of the trail , but the most spectacular was a platform eighty feet off the ground in another giant tree that commanded the whole area in which he was interested , the only drawback being that he had to get settled there before the animals appeared in the morning and stay until they had gone away at twilight . As they spent a lot of preliminary time in the forest before making their first entrance into the clearing , Kortlandt often waited hours for the curtain to rise . You could hear them coming , however , a long time in advance , yelling and calling . Suddenly they would fall silent , and then the adult males , usually , appeared first . A " broad black face " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its owner moved altogether into view . Then , one by one , the males emerged , each one looking around and listening as the first had done before stepping out . Even then , at least one of the animals , or possibly two or three , walked upright for a while , looking the land over . Suddenly , as if they had at last decided that they were safe , they broke into what Dr. Kortlandt describes as a wild and deafening display , yelling , rioting , chasing each other , shrieking and screaming . " They stamped the ground with hands and feet and smashed tree trunks with an open hand . Sometimes they pulled down half-grown papaw trees . Occasionally one of them would grab a branch or throw it while running full tilt through the group . " It was different with the females , whom he describes as almost always  | silent , wary , and shy , especially when they had children with them . They were fussy mothers who seemed to be preoccupied with keeping their young safe . Dr. Kortlandt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? as old as four years ? still being carried around even for short distances . He was surprised because he had seen many chimpanzee mothers and young in captivity , where the youngsters were far more enterprising and the mothers much more permissive ? or perhaps I should put it the other way around . Apart from being watched so much , however , the little chimpanzees of the eastern Congo had a wonderful life , he thought . By human standards they were pampered , allowed to do whatever they liked . He saw mothers handfeeding quite large adolescents of six or seven years . Children could invite themselves unrebuked to eat with strange mothers and children . At least twice he saw a child run past an adult male and give him a hard smack on the rump without arousing any anger . And yet , in spite of all this indulgence , they were n't spoiled . They never whined or whimpered , and they always obeyed orders promptly . How different , reflected Kortlandt , from the home life of the zoo chimp children he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's mother that among the chimpanzees she had watched in Tanganyika , things were not like that at all . The children were not so cossetted ; they became independent far younger ; and ? or but ? they were not nearly so well behaved as those he had watched . Another feature of Kortlandt 's chimpanzees ' behavior was their treatment of the elderly . One male animal he knew as Granddad might have been about forty , he surmised . Granddad 's silver-haired back was bent , his crown was gray , and his face sagged . He seemed somewhat handicapped : at least , he avoided climbing and seldom participated in the male intimidation displays . Among other primate species such an elder would have been unfortunate , mused Kortlandt , but Granddad was the tyrannical leader of the band , age or no age : all his whims and fancies were indulged , and even the biggest of the senior males sought his company . He acted as a kind of security inspector , too , a superwatchman , always making sure that everything was safe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed more lively , interested in everything , more human . " This is probably the reason it was so difficult , when I watched them from close by , to shake off the feeling that I was looking at some strange kind of human beings dressed in furs , " admits Dr. Kortlandt . " The chimpanzees were unceasingly alert and curious . They seized every opportunity to bring variety into their lives , taking different paths down the hill on different occa- sions and continually changing their gait and their mode of locomotion . They carefully examined all the objects I laid in their path and even collected some of them . Once I saw a chimpanzee gaze at a particularly beautiful sunset for a full fifteen minutes , watching the changing colors until it became so dark that he had to retire to the forest without stopping to pick a papaw for his evening meal . " Another " human " trait was the way they sometimes seemed to pause and ponder when faced with the necessity of making a decision , such as , Shall I turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would scratch himself while he made up his mind . ( Laboratory chimps , too , scratch when they are working out problems . ) When Dr. Kortlandt was in one of the blinds close to the chimpanzee trail , though the rest of him was hidden , his eyes , necessarily , were visible to close inspection . Now and then a chimpanzee would see them . Sometimes an adult male came straight toward him at such times , and would pause about ten feet off , and look straight into those eyes . When this happened , the chimp never either attacked or ran away , but just stood there for a while , looking thoughtfully into Dr. Kortlandt 's eyes and scratching his arms and chest before he wandered off . Dr. Kortlandt also noticed that except for those moments when they were whooping it up ? the intimidation displays , he called them ? his chimpanzees were for the most part silent . They communicated with each other by gesture or by " changes in posture or facial expression " : If a mother and child were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to move along , she looked at the child , and it immediately jumped onto her back . Or if it was n't looking at her just then , she tapped it lightly on the shoulder or arm . These chimpanzees , he said , definitely used weapons . They brandished or threw branches and clubs . The natives , when they said that the apes could catch spears and throw them back , were not really exaggerating very much . Soon after Dr. Kortlandt 's chimp watching , in 1961 , young Jane Goodall began her now famous observations of the chimpanzees ( also Pan t. schweinfurthii ) of the Gombe Stream Chimpanzee Reserve in Tanganyika . Her reports are more detailed than any produced before . To use her own words , the behavior she described " applies specifically to a rather atypical habitat , " since the country selected is not the closed rain liorest normal for chimpanzees . A mountainous strip runs for ten miles along the eastern shore of Lake Tanganyika and stretches inland to the mountain peaks of the Rift , which attain an altitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are steep valleys and ravines , and though at lower altitudes there is rain forest , one also finds open deciduous woodland higher up , with growths of tall grass . The site was chosen deliberately because it was easier to see the chimpanzees in open country than in the forest . Another atypical feature of Miss Goodall 's study is that she set out deliberately , in order to facilitate proceedings further , to habituate the animals to her presence . It took a long time , but she succeeded fairly well , by giving them extra food and also , when they seemed suspicious , by pretending not to be watching them at all : she would dig a hole or do something else to allay their doubts . There came a time when she could approach quite close without being resented , and after fourteen months the apes carried on their normal activities ? feeding , mating , sleeping ? when she was only from thirty to fifty feet away . In her estimation the two most interesting behavior patterns observed in the Gombe Stream Reserve were that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came as a surprise to the world of anthropology ( but not to me : Chimpo ate meat whenever I did ) . Jane Goodall 's chimps caught and ate young monkeys , young bushpigs , bushbuck , and on one occasion a young baboon . There has been much discussion as to why this particular lot of chimpanzees should indulge in such unusual behavior . Some anthropologists think that the explanation might be that they lead a rougher life than that of the rain forests , and do n't get enough wild fruit to satisfy their needs . Their use of tools is not as surprising ? other chimpanzees have been seen sticking twigs into bee communities for the honey . Even there , however , Goodall 's apes went further than the others , for they picked out leaves or bits of vine or twigs carefully and critically , and prepared their tools . When a chimpanzee had such a leaf , he would trim off the extra bits of it until he had left only the center , or if he had selected a twig , he carefully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stick about twelve inches long . Having prepared the stick a chimpanzee might carry it a long way to the most promising terrain , such as a likely-looking termite nest . There he would thrust the stick down a hole , wait a little , and draw it out covered with termites , which he would nibble off much as a child nibbles ice cream off a Popsicle . The Gombe Stream chimpanzees have also invented another kind of tool , to help them get water . Most wild chimps do not drink much water : here and there one has been seen sucking it up from a stream or pond . But these chimpanzees would take big leaves and crumple them , even chew them , then hold them in some stream until the leaves , like im- provised sponges , were soaked , and the moisture could be sucked up . Miss Goodall was still in the middle of her venture in 1962 when Vernon and Frances Reynolds began chimp watching in the Budongo Forest of Bunyoro in western Uganda . A map will show how close together the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t. schweinfurthii ) lived in what is a far more typical habitat than the Gombe Stream Reserve , being rain forest throughout . The Reynolds expedition took 270 days in all , from February to October . Their animals were more accustomed than were the Goodall chimpanzees to human company ? even that of white people ; a sawmill had been operating in their area for more than forty years , and several well-used man-made tracks ran through the forest . In the limited time they had , however , the observers failed to habituate the chimpanzees to their presence . There were many apes in the district , and the Reynoldses rarely saw the same ones twice in as many days . Setting up blinds was no good ; the chimpanzees kept away from such erections , and ? as with Nissen ? the group movements were unpredictable . The watchers therefore called on the services of friends who were willing to help keep tabs on the wanderings of different groups , and this worked pretty well . The Budongo chimps were primarily fruit-eating , but they also ate leaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while they were seen eating insects as well , but they were never seen eating meat ? or bird 's eggs , either . ( Dr. Kortlandt had tried leaving meat and hen 's eggs in the path for his chimps to find . They always ignored the meat , and only one animal took the eggs back into the forest . ) Nor did the Reynolds chimps use tools . It rained a good deal during the 170 days , and the observers noticed that the chimpanzees ' indifference to water turned to active dislike when it came down as rain . Nissen had never seen the Kindia apes in a downpour , but both Jane Goodall and the Reynoldses saw that their chimps hated rain . In a heavy downpour they hunched up in trees , " head resting on folded arms , head down " ( Reynolds ) . Sometimes they vocalized in sad tones , as if lamenting . It was in their observations of the group system that the Reynoldses made their most distinguished contribution to chimpanzee literature . " They saw that in the Budongo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the chimpanzees were " constantly changing membership , splitting apart , meeting others and joining them , congregating or dispersing . " They watched one popular fruiting fig tree for eight days and kept a record of who visited it , in what company . Two mothers with juveniles came every day and often outstayed all the others . For five days a whitebacked old male and a white-backed female came to feed ? and so on .  | The times of arrival and departure varied with the individual : never did all the animals arrive or depart as a group . Other chimpanzees were feeding at a place three quarters of a mile north along the river , and when the individuals left the fig tree , that is where they headed . Once in a while the watchers recognized some small band that stayed together as a relatively stable unit , but on the whole the composition of groups was unstable . However , certain types of grouping were frequent , as Dr. Kortlandt noticed on the plantation . There the chimpanzees sorted themselves out in what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visit the plantation only every two or three days , whereas the mothers with children were more faithful in their attendance . The sexual groups were more rowdy than the others , but between all these groups there was mixing and changing around , and on the plantation he saw little evidence of friction or resentment when such changes took place . Sometimes lone chimps would trickle in , he said ? any sort : single males , single females , mothers with infants ? and if they felt like joining up , that was all right , too . But in the Budongo Forest the shifting and changing seemed to lead to a lot of noise , sometimes long after the customary bedtime hour . In the Ituri , Chimpo and I used to hear tremendous yelling and drumming at odd times of the day , way off in the trees ? " Yow ! Yowl " screamed the wild chimpanzees , with a great rolling sound like tomtoms ? and we always paused in whatever we were doing to listen . Once , I remember , Chimpo had gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hear her answer with a small , gruff , tentative bark in the night . The Africans told me that the chimpanzees at these times were having a dance , stamping around in a circle ( as the Africans themselves did ) to the beat of a drum . Every once in a while , they said , one of the dancers got a step wrong , upon which the others would hit it and make it cry , hence the loud shrieks . Back in 1900 Garner was told the same story . He heard that the noisy chimpanzees were having a carnival , drumming on a clay drum they had modeled for the purpose , and jumping up and down , and singing . The Reynolds couple heard this " carnival " six times during their stay in the forest ? four times by day and twice by night . In all six cases the noise was prolonged for hours . It seemed to be associated with the meeting at a common food source of bands that may have been unfamiliar with each other , and the noise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Once the watchers tried to locate the animals during the carnival , to see what kind of behavior accompanied such a tremendous uproar , but they found it impossible . Calls were coming from all  | directions at once , they reported , and all the groups concerned seemed to be moving about rapidly . The Americans heard stamping and fastrunning feet sometimes behind them , sometimes in front , accompanied by outbursts of howling and the prolonged rolling of drums which shook the ground . After a while the most intense source of the racket moved off toward the south . There seemed to be little struggle for dominance among the Reynolds chimpanzees . Sometimes there were signs of difference in status , but this occupied little time in their routine and caused less stress . In the words of the observers , there was no evidence of a linear hierarchy of dominance in males or females : no observations of exclusive rights to receptive females , and there were no permanent leaders of groups . This is so unlike the social structure of other primates , such as baboons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but so matters appeared to the Reynoldses . They listed only twenty-five occasions when one chimpanzee showed dominance over another animal or a group . On seven of these , one male moved to allow another to pass or moved away as the dominant animal approached . Four times a small grooming group was seen to break up at the approach of a large male , and on one occasion a female who had been grooming two males moved up and groomed the intruder . Three times one male seemed to be the effective leader of a small band of adult males , for they left the tree when he left it , or followed him when he crossed the road . There were always some adult males who showed " a relaxed and confident bearing and unhurried gait . " One of this sort , a white or graybacked male , might stay on in a tree after the rest had moved on , looking around , not at all worried if he happened to spy human observers ? on the contrary , he sometimes showed an amiable curiosity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stepping into the road and then hurried across to the other side , these relaxed gray-backs ( but not all gray-backs ) had a way of sauntering across , not deigning to hurry . Possibly , say the Reynoldses , the looseness and instability found in chimp groups might have been exaggerated . " In fact , one may entertain the hypothesis that chimpanzees possess a social organization so highly developed that it can persist in the absence of immediate visual confirmation normally true for baboons . " When some of them find a new supply of food , for instance , and begin to make more noise than usual ? might this not be a means of signalling to all other chimps within earshot , calling them to come and eat ? And where vocalization does n't carry far enough , drumming might .  | One of the most dearly cherished projects of American primatologists , inside or outside government agencies , is to maintain somewhere easily accessible to themselves a colony of primates that live as they would in the wild . In a few instances men have come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the colony of Macaca mulatta , or rhesus monkeys , that occupies the little " Monkey Island , " Cayo Santiago , off the shore of Puerto Rico . It was founded in 1988 by the School of Tropical Medicine of the University of Puerto Rico in partnership with the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons . Four hundred monkeys from Lucknow in India were turned loose at that time , and their descendants have been there ever since . Rhesus have quick tempers and possess a complicated , well-marked social organization that renders them interesting to animal behaviorists , though to my mind nothing can make them lovable . On Cayo Santiago they flourished , but they soon ate up all the natural food , and now they must be fed supplementarily . The colony has had its ups and downs , financially speaking , but at last , under the protection of the National Institute of Neurological Diseases and Stroke , it achieved stability . Now it is a mainstay of the Laboratory of Perinatal Physiology that is located in San Juan , and plans are under way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The most ambitious of these projects for primate colonies is probably the one entertained by ? of all things ? a branch of the United States Air Force . An account written by a doctor and two Ph.D.s ? An Evaluation of the Behavior of the ARL Colony Chimpanzees ? carries the story a certain distance but does not finish it . The official name of the project was the Chimpanzee Colony of the 6571st Aeromedical Research Laboratory , Holloman Air Force Base , New Mexico 8833o . The colony , near Alamogordo in the south of the state , has since been taken over by Albany Medical College . Holloman had a lot of chimpanzees , which until April 1966 served chiefly as a pool for space research subjects ? Ham , the first chimpanzee in space , was a Holloman chimp . Then it occurred to some of the neurophysicists connected with the base that it might be possible to study what they called " the telemetered electrophysiological correlates of the freely moving primate or to study the behavioral effects of telemetered impulses delivered to specific neural centers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added , such studies would have to be done on animals with carefully documented behavioral baselines if they were to mean anything , and it could not be claimed that the chimpanzees at Holloman could be so described . Like all captive ' chimps they lived in conditions where they had no opportunity for social grouping and interaction . Typically they lived singly or in pairs , in cells much like those of human pris- ons . The reason for this treatment , of course , is that chimpanzees are very strong and clever , and it has always been easier to keep them segregated in this fashion , but for the purposes of studying behavior the method was most undesirable . " Not only are the adults kept in isolation or semiisolation , " wrote the authors of An Evaluation . . . , " but the young pass through critical periods of growth and development under the same impoverished conditions . " Babies are often separated from their mothers early in life , if not at birth , and such infants develop " stereotyped behavior , " rocking back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own hairy skin for want of their mothers ' . The authorities reasoned that it might be worth the trouble to create a chimpanzee haven at Holloman where the apes ? of which there were many ? could live together and develop social behavior in groups , as their brothers do in the wild .  | There was little similarity between the lush dark woods of , say , the Congo and the hard bright heat of southern New Mexico . Wild chimps come out into the open only when they must do so in quest of food . They are not thick on the ground , either : in the Budongo Forest the Reynoldses calculated only ten apes per square mile , and the Goodall chimps were one third as many as that . At Holloman Air Force Base , anything from twenty-five to forty-five animals were expected to live contentedly on thirty acres ? the number varied because the authorities , wishing to reproduce the shifting and changing of groups that had been observed in Africa , occasionally removed some animals and introduced others . They were aware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but reasoned that this would not matter since the chimps were fed twice a day and did n't have to live off the land . Unfortunately the chimps did not reason in the same way . Food or no food , their nature is to tear up trees , and in no time at all they had ruined every tree on the island . In their native woods this presumably would not have mattered , since a few chimps can not ruin a whole forest no matter how hard they work at it . As it was , within a short time nothing was left of the transplantings but a few dead cottonwood trunks , standing like Dali figures on the desert . Moreover , the fact that the chimps were artificially provided with food ? and were even fed twice a day instead of once ? took a lot of seasoning out of their lives . In his natural state a chimpanzee spends all day scratching for a living : it is all he knows how to do , and everything else is subordinate to the search for food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between meals . The consortium primates , deprived of most of this recreation , had to pack all their fun into those few minutes twice daily when the hoppers were filled with food and speedily emptied by the apes . " Food time was a time of competition , great excitement , and a high incidence of a wide variety of behavior , " wrote the authors of the report . " The rest of the time was really time on their hands . ' Although the animals were free to roam the island at will they tended to remain in the feeding rooms and in the shadow of the shelter building to avoid the hot desert sun . Excursions away from the building were usually made in early morning and late afternoon and on cool cloudy days . " Which was only , as a matter of fact , to be expected , for African chimpanzees avoid the direct rays of the sun . During their infrequent outings into full daylight , they sometimes wear large leaves on their heads , like sun hats . Even with these disadvantages , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however desert , would be preferable for the apes to a confined existence in separate cages . At least , the chimpanzees would  | have a chance to interact , they decided . And interact the apes did , often in unexpected ways . Knowing how important background and conditioning can be , the scientists of the ARL colony tried to amass information about their subjects , but not a good deal was known about many of the animals because at the time they were acquired nobody had bothered to keep records . It was known that the biggest specimens had been obtained from zoos and circuses , where full-grown apes become a problem and the owners are glad to get rid of them . Otherwise , most of the collection , it is probable , were Africa-born and had been caught as infants in the wild : almost certainly they had undergone painful experiences at that time and later when they were sent abroad . It was bad enough for a baby to be snatched from his mother ? who was very likely dead by that time ? but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an animal dealer 's in Nigeria , at Kano in the north , I once saw a small chimpanzee packed and ready for shipment by air in a wooden cube-shaped case so small that the creature had to keep its head tucked down almost to its knees , and when I asked when it was to be sent off , the dealer answered carelessly , " Oh , probably within ten days or so . " Even if this chimpanzee survived , which seems unlikely , it would hardly retain any vivid memory of group life among its own kind . Once they had ruined all their trees , the consortium chimpanzees ' only playthings were bits of stick and branches from the chaparral and a few rocks , plus whatever implements they managed to steal from their jailers . In the rueful words of the authors , " Although the Consortium provided an enriched environment , it fell short of replicating their native African habitat . " For fourteen months they were observed thoroughly , all day , at periods ranging from a few minutes to three hours , until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What with graduate students lending a hand in the summer and everybody making notes and taking pictures , the chimpanzees were fully aware that they were the cynosure of all eyes as long as daylight lasted . Even at feeding time when they appeared to be alone ? for the windows of the building were of one-way glass ? they must have known that a number of Big Brothers were watching them . As far as anyone could tell they were not inhibited by this knowledge . No one who knows anything about prison life will be surprised to hear that the consortium chimpanzees were a very quarrelsome lot , but the psychologists who directed the experiment , being scientists , did not come to this conclusion in advance , for that would have been theorizing on the basis of human behavior , which is wrong .  | They remained firmly nonanthropomorphic , receiving as fresh the attested news that a " high incidence of aggression " was the rule , and commenting , " This contrasted sharply with observations of chimpanzees in the wild . Goodall reported that attack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or acquired objects . Usually , attack was avoided by gestures and vocalizations . Scars and other evidence of past aggression were rare in the wild animals . " In contrast is the consortium record . In one week there the watchers counted 108 aggressive incidents , most occurring around feeding time . Females were attacked more often than males , but the females too were aggressive , attacking males and females regardless . Every time the group was altered , by withdrawal or addition , the chimps got as upset as they did when rain , wind , or dust storms suddenly descended on Alamogordo , and they became equally excited every time their dominant male came home to the shelter after a walk on the island . The fact that there was a dominant male marks another big difference between the social structure of wild chimpanzees and those of the consortium . At Holloman there was always a leader , boss , or dictator ? whatever term one wishes to use ? and he had to keep alert so as not to lose his position . Often during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between two animals turn into mob war , with whole groups of chimps attacking both the first aggressor and his victim . Newly arriving animals were usually immediately attacked . Sometimes they were only mildly harassed , but on certain occasions the newcomer was so severely beaten that human attendants had to remove him . However , if such a one made the appropriate " submissive gesture " ? offering the back of his hand or presenting his rear ? he usually avoided being attacked at all , and was accepted into the group . Animals that screamed or whined constantly or threw temper tantrums were frequently beaten up . ( A chimpanzee temper tantrum is curious . The animal screams , stamps , rolls on the ground and sometimes rushes around blindly , bumping into whatever stands in his way . In anthropomorphic language , the chimpanzee is hysterical . ) The annals of the consortium are full of haunting stories about individual animals like George , a large , mature chimp who tended to be neurotic . The behaviorists moved George out of his cage and put him into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thumb of an animal named Sampson . During the first day a showdown was averted because George simply huddled under the turnstile where he had been injected into the colony and was n't perceived . Next day , however , he was shooed out into the open on the island , and was promptly beaten ? not by Sampson himself , but the others . Sampson simply " circled the melee " and " seemed to be directing  | the action . " Poor George ricocheted from one attacker to another until , trying to dodge them , he slipped and fell into the moat . Chimpanzees are top-heavy , and George would have drowned if the observers had not pulled him out . Back on dry land , he meekly let himself be led by the hand to his quiet , safe cell . At another time when the consortium leader was an animal named Chuck , Tim was put in . Like George and Chuck and Sampson , Tim was a fine figure of a chimp . Chuck and Tim met and began circling each other , both screaming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that their gums showed . They never came to grips with each other , but now and then one of them would hug a nearby onlooker among the chimpanzees ? a gesture often made by fearsome or worried animals ? until at last Chuck presented his hind quarters and Tim mounted him for a minute . ( Mounting between male chimpanzees is a sign of dominance , not sex . ) Chuck then turned around and even more specifically invited Tim to be the boss , presenting the back of his hand , limply held , to Tim 's mouth ? the chimpanzee equivalent of saying " Uncle . " Tim took the hand gently in his mouth and the two animals walked along together for about ten feet before he dropped it . Power had passed from Chuck to Tim , and the watching chimps , who all along were shrieking as if in terror , now calmed down and were quiet . In nature chimpanzees are not what we consider sexy . When they do copulate they are casual and promiscuous , never showing sexual jealousy : Such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the result of female , rather than male , enterprise . But the apes of the consortium were different : they " exhibited an extremely high frequency of copulatory and other sexual behavior , " males as well as females taking the initiative . Three healthy chimp babies were born at Holloman in 1966 . One of them , Susu , was kept with her mother through the first year of her life . She was a well-adjusted little chimp , sucking her thumb only once , and that briefly , soon after birth . " She formed no intermediate object-relationships and was first observed to show a tentative interest in potential play-objects at g months of age , " wrote the authors , by which I think they mean that she did n't hang on to a security blanket and began to play with toys at nine months . Phyllis and Little K , the other infants , did not fare as well . Phyllis , who was separated from her mother at birth , immediately formed an intense attachment to a blanket : at nine months she was still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the blanket was taken away for a time , she sucked her thumb . Little K , who was separated from his mother at five months , also fell in love with  | a blanket . He was n't as firmly attached to it as Phyllis was , but he too would n't go to sleep unless he had it . Little K sucked his thumb less often than Phyllis . One of the difficulties encountered in keeping chimpanzees is their love of fiddling with things , a practice regrettably described by behaviorists as " object manipulation . " At Holloman when caged animals had nothing better to play with , they arranged and rearranged bits of food in nests around themselves as they ate . When this palled , they wiggled the padlocks on the outside of their barred gates . Even when they had discovered that the padlocks would n't break , they rattled them . The comparatively free animals on the island brought back to the shelter any playthings they could find ? burlap bags , metal rods , and building tools left by workmen . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aim improving as time passed . About half the apes learned from the other half how to spit , and so time was whiled away through one stratagem or another until somebody thought of playing in the moat . Until then , the island 's inhabitants had behaved toward the moat much as their guardians had expected them to , remembering that chimps are thought to have a fear of water . But one day a flung stone missed its mark and landed with a splash in the water : chimpanzees promptly threw in more objects for bigger splashes , and after a while a brave ape dipped a stick into the moat , pulled it out , and licked the water off . Others followed his example , and one thing led to another until in 1967 a daring young female learned that she could make splashes by hitting the water 's surface with her hand . Soon she was pulling things out of the moat . Then she found out that she could lower herself into the water quite safely as long as she held on to the cyclone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Dipping then became a regular form of recreation at the consortium ? but its originator , the daring young female , drowned . That was as far as the story went in print . In 1968 I flew out to Alamogordo to see the consortium for myself . Getting there is a fairly complicated business entailing changes of plane , because the air field is too small to take ordinary national carriers , but I got there at last , landing on a sandy plain that lay prone for miles between two distant blue mountain ranges . In the slanting rays of an autumn sun the sand sparkled . The few buildings that stood near the airport were dwarfed by the sky 's enormous stretch . An officer , Captain ? or Doctor ? Robert McRitchie drove out to fetch me . ( As all the officers I met at Holloman were medical men , I shall ignore their military rank . ) He said as the car started , " I hope you are n't expecting great things at  | the consortium . There 's not a lot to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snags and we also had a considerable amount of bad luck . The moat , for instance ? Who would have expected chimps to get used to water ? But they did ; they even began wading right across and then taking off as fast as they could go . We had to deepen the ditch . Even so , one animal seemed determined to commit suicide . And sometimes they tried to drown each other : we lost a few like that . I tell you , it was a mess . You can see the moat over to the right if you look fast . " I did see it , curving away in the distance , just before our road curved in its turn and took us into and through a number of gates and a complex array , like a little hamlet , of buildings . " There is n't any water in the moat now , is there ? " I asked . Dr. McRitchie shook his head , a little grimly . " There is n't ; that 's right . We had trouble with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water seeped out . One way and another it 's been some time since we kept chimps on the island . There was another time during the winter when we had a freak cold snap and everything froze over : all they had to do was run across without even getting their feet wet , and some did . The island 's been a headache . Thank God , it is n't my department : my principal job is coordinating immunological material for other places , chiefly New York . We work in with Dr. Alexander S. Wiener and Dr. Jan Moor-Jankowski . " You know , do n't you , that chimpanzee blood is in some respects like ours ? So is baboon blood . We send sera all over the world for comparative studies . One of our programs is to establish a kind of serum bank of all the known blood types of chimpanzees . The plasma can be frozen and preserved in liquid nitrogen . There 's a prejudice against using primate blood for these purposes , but if we could overcome it , we have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as we passed within sight of a large baboon in a cage just inside a shed . " That animal must just have arrived . He 's a beauty , is n't he ? I wonder who 's working with him . . . . Look , over there is the original Stapp speed bench . " It looked like a pair of giant 's skis with a small chair at one end . " Do you remember the tests they used to make with that machine ? " he asked . " The effects of impact , and so on ? why we must use safety belts , and what happens in space . " " I think I remember , " I said . " There were photographs of chimps in space helmets , buckled into chairs like that one . " " That was it . " We parked the car and entered the main building . Here there was no immediate evidence of living chimpanzees , though Dr. McRitchie assured  | me that there were at that date 138 of the animals nearby . All was brightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in charge to the little auditorium complete with screen and projector , where I saw movies of space experiments and learned something of the work being done by the ARL at that time , in the dawn of the Space Age . If here and there I missed a point because of the unfamiliar vocabulary used by these medical men , it was not their fault : I should have asked ? and sometimes I did . I looked respectfully at a list thrown on the screen for my benefit : At this point I stopped for breath , surprised that there was nothing really impossibly mysterious about it all so far . I plunged on : Here I broke off to ask , " What does circadian ' mean ? " " Oh , that 's your everyday ordinary routine ? circa diem . When you fly a long distance , or rather when you 're in the air a long time ? across the Atlantic , for instance ? your sleep pattern and digestion become upset .  | The routine 's been interrupted . A lot of these effects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know the upset takes place . " " I know , " I said . " It often takes me as much as four days to get over that funny feeling I have after a transatlantic flight . " He replied cheerfully , " It 's more like two weeks before you 're back to normal , but you 're not aware of that . " By a natural transition I went next to meet an enthusiastic young man in charge of sleep research . " We 've had a sleep laboratory here at Holloman for about three years , " he told me , " which means we 're comparatively new as laboratories go . We began with rhesus because their sleep stages are something like our own . There are five stages of sleep , you know . First stage is a state of drowsiness , when you 're just dropping off : with stages two , three , and four you get progressively deeper into sleep . Stage five is what we call dream sleep , at which a change occurs . It 's not necessarily deeper than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cycle lasts from sixty to a hundred minutes : a person sleeping normally will run through several of these cycles each night , possibly five or six , all the way from light sleep to deep to dream . You 've probably heard that a dream lasts only a split second , have n't you ? ? no matter how long it seems to take . Well , it 's false : a dream can go on for quite a long time . The reason people got that idea about split-second timing is that they so often forget their dreams after waking . If a dreaming person is aroused in the middle of a dream he does n't forget : he remembers it clearly , but if he 's had his dream out and finishes it , he may not recall any of it next day . One aim in our research is to discover how to achieve stage four in a shorter space of time . Stage four ? deep sleep without dreams ? seems to be the recuperative , restorative stage . A sleep-deprived rhesus or chimp , kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes into stage four almost immediately . " There 's no doubt about it ; we need to find out a lot more about the nature of sleep . Why do we need sleep ? Are there specific areas of the brain that trigger it ? Then there are the effects of chemistry , the different drugs that bring on sleep or wakefulness . In these matters we can control monkeys better than humans : they ca n't trick us as the humans can . We 'd like to find out if they recover from deprivation in the same way as humans . The record time a rhesus has been kept awake is eight days compared with the human record of eleven , and we did n't notice any neurological damage in either the human or the monkey . There 's no doubt that with us a good deal of fatigue can be overcome with high motivation , but you ca n't sustain the performance forever . Yet the animals that went eight days without sleep worked at their ordinary tasks for  | food in the usual way , though they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept awake until they die , I believe . " I was struck by one feature of the last space flight . This was Apollo 7 . Out of four things the astronauts complained of , three had to do with sleep . They said their sleep was interrupted too often , that they did n't get enough sleep , and that their sleeping arrangements were uncomfortable ? the last squawk was about food . So there you are , three out of four . Why , since we 're getting to know so much about sleep , do we send them up to suffer as they do ? The sleep hardware in the space module is really awful ? the net , the belt that holds them in , their hands being tied down ? of course , they ca n't sleep . They ought to have more comfort . Perhaps one of these days we 'll work out a method of control by which men in such situations can get enough of the right sort of sleep . " Our last call was on Dr. Donald S. Farrer of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ARL ape collection that the Gardners of Reno obtained their famous chimpanzee Washoe , now learning to use a sign language . " This laboratory is purely for applied work , " he said . " We give the animals problems , using the Skinnerian approach i.e. , rewards for good behavior , but no punishments , and see if and how they can be worked out . NASA asks for certain answers , and we 're here to supply them if we can . But one of my own favorite projects deals with the theoretical-cognitive behavior of the chimpanzee . " At my expression of frantic noncognition he relented and slowed down . " For example . We did a nice little experiment a few years ago when we had to develop a fairly simple task for the animal . You may recall the experiment used by Mrs. Kots in Moscow in 1910 on her chimpanzee ? the matching-sample test to discover whether a chimpanzee is able to distinguish colors . We elaborated on that and developed an automatic projector with which we show the animal a sample of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a color one ? a triangle , say . The chimpanzee is seated before a board on which various shapes , induding a triangle , are painted on as many buttons . If , on seeing a triangle projected before him , he presses the matching button with a triangle on it , he gets a reward . " This started out as a comparison test , but what it turned into was a test for length of memory . In the full-dress study we have twenty-four different problems to solve . One of our chimps was very good indeed at it , so good that she became a sort of show all on her own ? we always trotted her out when we had visitors because she nearly always pushed the right button . Then we began to wonder about her when one of us no- ticed that she always watched the visitors before she punched the button . Did her response depend on the visitors ' reactions ? Or ? another possibility ? had she memorized the whole sequence of symbols ? If so , the test was of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried her out without visitors and with a scrambled sequence of symbols . It made no difference : she got the right answers just the same . We decided that she must be an extraordinary animal , a genius among chimps , and to prove it we tried out two other animals , training them the same way . Do you know what happened ? Those two new chimps got the right answers just as often as the first one did . They really could memorize those pictures : we had to admit it . " Next we tried them all on partly obscured symbols , and they still did fairly well . In fact , we did n't flummox them until finally we turned the pictures around and presented the chimps with a mirror image of the shapes they were used to . At last , this did it : they acted as if they 'd never seen the pictures before . They had to go back to the beginning and learn them all over again . " We 're often asked how clever the chimpanzee is . To my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at asking the chimpanzee questions ? It 's establishing communication that often takes most of the time : sometimes you need six months just to make the animal understand what you want him to do . Then there 's the matter of temperaments , your own as well as the chimp 's . One investigator may find it impossible to work with a certain animal we 'll call Martha : he 'll want us to get rid of Martha because , he says , she 's hopelessly dumb . Then along comes another investigator who finds Martha absolutely brilliant : he always asks for her . You can never tell in advance . It 's like teachers in a school : no teacher treats all his students alike ? it 's really a question of rapport . Experienced workers here will tell you they can see from the beginning how an animal is going to react in a given situation or problem . A very active , aggressive rhesus may learn to press a lever more quickly than a docile animal would , and prove more easy to teach . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sight of it . Here 's an interesting question , Can you define manipulation as a basic need ? It 's an almost universal aspect of primate behavior . Man can not create any machine that primates can not take apart . " Dr. Farrer grinned . " That idea 's pretty controversial , I guess , but it 's fun to play with . Another question we 're often asked is whether or not chimps can count . My own belief is that they can , at least up to five . A counting chimp can be trained to push a button marked five , as a kind of stopping place , or punctuation . Some people object to this as proof , saying that the chimp simply recognizes the symbol for five , and we rigged up a new set of symbols instead  | of our numerals : the chimpanzee still got it right . Admittedly you 'd have to define the term ' counting . ' To avoid this difficulty we might say the animal has a differential response to five different symbols . . . . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ symbols and an electronic board in each cage , outfitted with a sign that tells each chimpanzee when it 's his turn to play . Sometimes a player cheats by pushing a button twice , instead of once when it 's his turn . And sometimes a chimp becomes disgusted and gives a Bronx cheer . The one that wins gets a food pellet or something like that . One of our animals got very good , winning every time : another always blocked his opponent . In fact , that second one , Paleface , became so good that we had to discontinue the games for him when he attained the weight of ninety-eight pounds and learned to push his Plexiglas window out in the excitement . The experiment was n't worth the risk and expense . Another chimp , Big Mean , once got so mad after losing three or four games to Paleface that she would n't play at all , but sulked and refused to push the button . This spoiled Paleface 's game until he learned to let her win a few times . " Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ department , depressing as an outsize monkey house in any old-fashioned zoo , with one strong cage after another . Some held animals of impressive size . The cages were large and the place very clean , but it was gray and stank of antiseptic , and soon we went out of doors to look at the deserted island . " You could call it a noble experiment , I guess , while it lasted , " said my companion , " but sometimes there was hell to pay in there . You see that fencing over there ? The idea was to cut the area in two so we could observe two lots of animals . They thought it would work fine ? it 's electrified , or was , and as you can see , it 's made of reinforced piping with cables that carried the charge . It did n't work for as much as five minutes . The first chimp to get around it did just that ? he grabbed the pipe at the end of the fence where it overhangs the moat , and swung around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shock . The others climbed over wherever they felt like it . They have thick skin and hair on top of that , which seems to insulate them . One female climbed the fence after she 'd run into the moat , while she was still soaking wet , and the current did n't affect her at all . Before they built this fence they had a weaker one ? the chimps pulled it up and used pieces of it to make nests . It 's surprising how much strength they have . Now we 're designing an even stronger fence ; it just might work . " We came to a place where a sort of avenue had been constructed with a double line of fencing across the middle of the area . The pathway thus  | left was about seven or eight feet across . Dr. McRitchie asked the guard who accompanied us , " Who 's supposed to walk down there when you 've got animals on either side ? I would n't , I can tell you . " The guard grinned and shook his head . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They 're trying something better now . " Since my visit there has been a new publication by the ARL people : Colony Management and Proposed Alterations in Light of Existing Conditions at the Chimpanzee Consortium . The authors make several points : that it is vitally necessary to insure a future supply of chimpanzees , considering their decimation in the wild ; that to insure the consortium apes ' health , fighting amongst them should be reduced ; that " there should be an increased effort to consider the manipulative capabilities and strength of chimpanzees when planning future construction , " and that better use should be made of " the research potential of the facility . " The authors say that there has been " insufficient communication between personnel with knowledge of these capabilities and those who design and construct the structures , " and they add , " If a chimpanzee can reach a bolt or loose lock , he will remove it . If there is a ' cold ' spot on a high voltage structure , the chimpanzee will quickly discover it ; their thick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against shock . Furthermore , chimpanzees have a propensity to build nests . . . and will use all available material to do so . Their great strength even permits them to use cyclone fencing if it is not firmly secured . During periods of great excitement chimpanzees tend to hit and slap nearby objects including observation windows within reach . Because of a scarcity of shade and manipulable objects on the land area destruction has been most intense in and near the building . The moat has been successful in preventing escape , but several animals have drowned there . " In addition , they remark , because food , water , and most of the shade from the desert heat are available only at the shelter , the animals naturally congregate there and do n't use the rest of the area . Also , in comparison with wild groups there are not enough adults to deal with the adolescents at the consortium . If two chimps do n't like each other , they ca n't get out of each other 's sight there as they could in the wild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that feeding and watering stations be placed all over the area , so that newly introduced animals would be able to get their rations without facing the whole community , and there would be fairer shares for all . The land area should be divided into halves by a moat rather than the present fences , and both sides should be provided with " sturdy concrete and steel playground equipment , " possibly including jungle gyms and cement sewer pipes .  | There should be much more shade to relieve the congestion around the shelter , and introduction procedure should be changed : instead of simply throwing a newcomer in , he might be introduced by slow stages , while the dominant male is somewhere else . Not that all the " status " males turn out to be bullies . Tim , for instance , was more of a policeman than a tyrant , generally breaking up rather than initiating fights .  | Anyone who has ever tried to raise a chimpanzee can bear witness that it is not easy . In the words of the director of the Baltimore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I 've had him here for two years , and that 's a lot of chimp . " So I paid attention when I heard for the first time of Professor William B. Lemmon , of the psychology department of the University of Oklahoma at Norman . " You 'll be interested , " my informant assured me . " He keeps chimpanzees . I think he observes their behavior . " " Is that so ? " I asked politely . " As a matter of fact I saw a couple of chimpanzees only yesterday in Washington ? young ones , of course . " He said , " Well , I do n't know how old Bill Lemmon 's are , but he must have all ages , big and small . He 's got some whoppers . " This was what made me prick up my ears . I asked how many there were at Norman , and jumped at the reply : " Probably about twenty , I guess . Why , is that unusual ? " I got busy right away on what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up with a paper entitled " Delivery and Maternal Behavior in Captive-Reared Primiparous Chimpanzees , Pan troglodytes . " He had been working , it seemed , on the familiar question of the nature of what we used to call instinct ? or , as he put it , which aspects of complex social behavior can be considered " pre-wired " and/or learned . " Maternal behavior would seem an excellent area for such investigation , " he wrote .  | " Its species survival importance is obvious and maternal behavior is clearly composed of molecular components whose molar integration necessarily varies with circumstance . " This was difficult stuff , but I looked up his use of the word molar ? " mass , opposite to molecular " ? and doggedly went on reading . The study began some time ago , he said , when he and his associates first acquired a pair of wild-caught chimpanzees , each about a year old . During the first year the apes spent with their new owners , they demonstrated many " integrated , socially significant behaviors which seemed to occur without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one could not be sure . The chimpanzees might have observed and learned this behavior before they were captured , " the particular behavior remaining , as it were , quiescent until an opportunity arose for its direct repetition . " The human owners decided therefore to obtain a few newborn female infant chimps , and " to investigate sexual and maternal behavior under circumstances where direct learning or initiation could be controlled . " This sounded good , but as they discovered , it was not at all easy to get newborn chimpanzees , male or female , and it was only after a two-year search that they acquired two such animals the day they were born . The chimpanzees were half sisters . " Each was born , six weeks apart , of an experforming mother and a common sire , " records Dr. Lemmon ; and each was immediately placed by adoption , as it were , with " a faculty family , " in absolute species isolation ? or as we laymen would say , in situations where there was no chance of either infant seeing other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two years their social behavior and development had been closely followed and observed . But it seemed clear that if he wanted enough chimpanzees for future experiment , he would have to breed his own . He set to work , and within another four years he had collected thirteen more animals from zoos and dealers , as well as animal trainers and families that could no longer control their chimp pets . Each animal , as it happened , had been born wild ? after all , chimps have been breeding in captivity at a reasonable rate for only a short time ? and several of the animals had had no contact with their own species since capture . Some of the males , possibly as a result of such erratic development , were sexually inactive , if not impotent , but in the end this did not prove to be much of a problem to the wellbeing of the colony as a whole . Within the year , three females had successfully given birth to healthy infants . Soon after the birth , each of the mothers gave her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of life " technique , evidently to establish breathing . Other observers have seen similar behavior at various places and times , but the fact was surprising to the Norman people , nevertheless , as were other details of be- havior . For example , none of the mothers put her infant spontaneously to the breast : the infant had to find it himself . " The mother is initially tolerant of nursing , and never becomes more than passively facilitating , " reported Dr. Lemmon . A little chimp 's cry of distress ( " distress vocalization " ) is an " imperative signal " to the mother , even if she does n't know at first what to do about it . Twice the observers took a baby from its mother , then later reunited them , and the mother in both cases did n't seem to recognize her baby until it cried , or vocalized : then all was well . But there was no evidence , the professor said , of " felt loss " on a mother 's part if her infant was removed from her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was no apparent grief felt . Mothers whose infants had been removed were not interested when they were offered stuffed animals instead ; the other adult chimpanzees seemed scared to death of these inanimate objects . An infant left with its mother responds early to chimpanzee vocalization ( noises ) . From the first day it responds to food hoots with food hoots , to greeting hoots with greeting hoots even when the latter originate from an animal not its mother . When the infant is about five months old there is evidence of separation , frequently initiated by the mother ? which means , I suppose , that she encourages the baby to let go of her once in a while , and walk by itself . By the age of eight months the baby has learned to beg from its mother " with rather more arrogance than do adult chimpanzees . " Little chimps take liberties with all the adults , but the mature apes are invariably gentle with them , even those not their own , and even when the babies are making pests of themselves . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reproving fashion under these circumstances ? in a fashion which can not help but be socializing for the infant , " wrote Dr. Lemmon . Opposed to this pleasant fact is the disturbing one that the maternal behavior of the animals disintegrates under extreme stress . If a mother and infant are put into a squeeze cage ? and if the mother has already been in one of those frightening contraptions , in which one of the sides can be moved , squeezing the inmate into immobility ? in her agitation she usually drops the baby and ignores its cries of distress . Summing up , Dr. Lemmon said that if we accept the observation made by Dr. C. H. Kratochvil , formerly of Holloman Air Force Base , that " below the level of the cortex , the chimpanzee 's central nervous system is impossible to distinguish from that of the human by any physiological measure , " it would seem possible to raise the question as to whether there are not many more " pre-wired , " socially significant behaviors in both Homo and Pan than it is now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportunity to record the maternal behavior of chimpanzee females  | who have had no chimpanzee contact since the day of their birth , " he writes , " we can certainly be more definitive . " My meeting with Professor Lemmon took place in his office in Norman . He is a large man with informal manners , and he wears a genuine under-the-chin goatee , evidently cultivated so that he can pull at it while talking or lecturing . He tugged at it now , sitting back comfortably in his chair . " There 's been a lot of crap circulated about primate behavior . The present god of behaviorists is Skinner , as you must have discovered by this time . He 's got a really bright gang working there . Yerkes started it all , of course ? he was pure , quite pure , and he had all the best people of his time . I 'd say that at least half the psychologists worth anything today were once at Orange Park . After all , Yerkes had the only chimpanzee reservoir in the world after Kohler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be objective , purely objective " ? I suddenly realized that Dr. Lemmon 's eyes were fixed on me coldly and defiantly ; he swept on ? " and as a result they missed a lot . " " I 'm sure they did , " I said heartily . He relaxed . " He had this terror of anthropomorphism . All his people came out of Orange Park with a clinical objection to applying the principles of primate behavior to human behavior . But you 've got to . " I nodded with genuine enthusiasm , and he took a fresh breath . " I used to work in federal prisons here for a while as a consultant . It was fascinating . I found out a lot about the Oedipus myth while I was on that job . Freud was right , you know , absolutely right after all ? if for the wrong reasons . The Oedipus thing is there all right , in our origins . If I 'd doubted it before , the prisoners would have taught me it 's there , but I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biologically determined . It 's wired in , the whole thing . " I said , " See if I 've got this straight . I can hardly believe ? you mean chimps have an Oedipus complex ? " He nodded seriously . " I 'll give you a copy of something I 've written about this , but we 'd better talk about it first . Right now I think we 'd better go and see the family ? we keep them in the country , of course . Ready ? " It was a bright September day . We drove through rolling country , in which I could see very few houses ; even fences were not much in evidence . After some miles we turned in at the Lemmon driveway , while he explained that this piece of country was good for his purposes : he needed plenty of ground , not only for various kinds of primates but for other species he worked with , and there was nobody close enough to be bothered by chimpanzee noises .  | He stopped the car near a white farmhouse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cage farther off to one side . On our right was a wide ravine , or arroyo , that might at times be a stream bed . Its red Oklahoma soil supported bushes , tall grass , and on the other side of the ravine a pretty copse of trees , like a little park , overlooking a pond . The trees were surrounded by a fence , behind which an animal suddenly leaped from one branch to another . It could not be a squirrel , I said to myself ? the branches shook too much for that . I squinted for a better look . " You 're right , " said Dr. Lemmon . " They 're gibbons : I have a pair , and she 's expecting an infant one of these days . We can take a closer look later . " He led the way around the house to the outbuildings , pausing on the way to greet a young man in a white coat . Another youth in blue overalls opened a door for us , and we stepped through into a large , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a many-layered noise so palpable that for a minute I had the illusion that I could n't even see ? a deafening uproar of screams , roars , and the bong , bong , bong of a huge iron drum . Directly in front of us was a skeleton wall of strong iron bars running from floor to ceiling . The bars formed a room within the room , and inside that barred room were smaller rooms , all walled off by bars . Here and there was an opening in one of the sections , like a door ; this door could be shut by a large flat piece of iron . It was on such an iron that the chimpanzees hammered at times with their hands and feet . But these details I made out later . At first all I saw were the faces peering out at us , between great fists grasping the bars ? chimps , a large number of chimps in all directions , staring raptly at Dr. Lemmon , though now and then a caramel-colored pair of eyes slid over to look at me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up or at least stooped in a standing position . Some chose to leap up and hang high . In one corner a mother hung carelessly , one hand on a vertical bar and the other on the ceiling , her baby peering out from behind her shoulder . The baby , too , watched Dr. Lemmon , who kept talking , pointing the animals out and naming them to me , giving little biographical sketches . " This one used to work in a circus , and he still does tricks sometimes for his own amusement ? or maybe it 's for mine . Here you are , " he said to the chimp , and handed into his eager black fingers a lighted cigarette . The ape took it delicately and put it into his mouth , lit end first . I cried , " Oh , do n't ! He 's hurting himself , he 'll burn himself ! " But Dr. Lemmon signalled me to shut up . A moment later the chimpanzee opened his mouth and showed us the cigarette in the proper position , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inhaling with manifest pleasure , his dark eyes surveying me with a touch of complacency . An- other ape banged the metal door violently and several animals screamed as if in tune . In a rear compartment water was running out of a faucet near a younger animal that had just turned it on . Dr. Lemmon roared , " Turn that off ! " and the young chimpanzee hastily obeyed . I said , " But he understood you ! " " Of course , he did . They understand a lot , " he replied . " Yerkes did n't give them enough credit ? he was so afraid of the wrong interpretations ? but I assure you that a chimp can put two and two together and get twenty-six if he feels like it . Mind you , they wo n't obey just anybody . They would n't obey you , for instance . " As he talked he moved farther into the room , mounting a couple of ironwork steps , like fire-escape steps , that led to a passageway . I followed , thinking it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a heavy curved fingernail came up from beneath and hooked itself around the side of my shoe . For the first time I realized that a chimpanzee was beneath the floor , which was hollow , and I screamed and leaped just in time to retain my shoe . But as soon as I landed on another spot , two hairy fingers poked up and this time nearly succeeded in stripping my foot before Dr. Lemmon 's shouting sent the hidden chimpanzee scuttling out into the open cage . There he sat down and looked pleased with himself . Another animal pounded on the metal , sending out great waves of percussion , and yet others shrieked . Before the clamor died down , we left . Two chimpanzees near the door had to be diverted with bananas so that they would n't spit as I passed . Dr. Lemmon told me that some of the chimps who were small when they arrived had spent a few weeks or months in the house with his wife and himself , to get accustomed to civilized life . " One funny thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way they remembered . I keep a lot of plants in the house , and they were taught not to meddle with them . Then the chimps got bigger and went out to join the others . The other day we had a jail break ? one of the assistants was careless about shutting a door , and a lot of them got out . My wife and I were in town when it happened , and for a long time nobody could get in touch with us , but finally we heard a radio broadcast , and I can tell you , we skimmed the top of the hedges on the way back . Nine of the chimps had gone through the house , and everything was a mess ? except my plants . They had n't touched one of them , though outside they rooted up everything in the garden . We used to have an exercise yard , but they ruined it . We 'll have to build another when we have the money . " I asked how he had got the big chimpanzees to go back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I took them by the hand and led them in , of course , " he said .
