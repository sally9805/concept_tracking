That ritual of neglect , breakfast , which chastened the American woman for years and condemned her to staring at the back of her husband 's newspaper while the children dashed through the kitchen with sitcom explanations of why they were n't eating , " Ca n't stop , Wally has the car for the prom and we 're building an A-bomb for our science project in the trunk ... " was finally abolished when breakfast itself was abolished . Husbands found solace in their office vending machines ; the children munched breakfast bars with " all the vitamins and minerals of a dozen eggs , 48 strips of bacon , all the vitamin C of three Florida orange groves and the equivalent calcium of the output of three Holstein cows " ; and the women went off to work . One more brick fell from the foundation of the U.S. family . Then along came morning television . Because it spewed news , nobody felt guilty about being entertained . Because it came in segments  --  male first , female next with sprinklings of " **51;3955;TOOLONG " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marriage of emotional and nutritional well-being . " When people get up in the morning , " says David Hartman , irresistibly homey star of " Good Morning , America , " and perhaps the most successful chatsman since Dave Garroway , " they have little time . Mostly they 're listening , not looking . We want to get usable information to them  --  what 's happened in the last 24 hours . But we want to do it with a sense of individuality . In my mind I do n't see a mass of people , I see one person . " We 're about 50150 , women , men , the first hour , then it changes to 80/20 . The age group 's 18 to 49 , younger than morning TV 's ever been before . " David Hartman is 42 himself , tall ( 6 ' 4 " ) , lean ( 200 lbs. ) though when he strips to tee shirt for the makeup woman to paint him Sunkist orange , he appears to have the unnatural body of a natural athlete , a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with compensation in its proportion , more legs and arms than gravitational logic . " Good Morning , America 's " competition is the " Today " show , older but somehow stiffer , less free wheeling . " The ' Today ' show has 210 markets ; we have about 140 , " Hartman says of the competition . " Of the 9 major cities we 're in 5 . " The " Today " show 's Torn Brokaw and his wife are good friends of David and Maureen Hartman . David does n't worry too much about ratings . " They can prove whatever you want them to . We 're more concerned with who 's watching . The idea of our show is to transpose what 's natural , conversational , the feeling of just talking with one person , to a larger audience . " To do this , " Good Morning , America " moves around a set that vaguely resembles the American household with kitchen , den , living room and jungle of plastic plants . Jack Anderson , Rona Barrett , Erma Bombeck , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cosell and Helen Gurley Brown are regulars on the show . Then there is Sandy Hill , replacement for Nancy Dussault , whose departure from the show was so genuinely felt David contrived to be away her last day and John Lindsay , His Honor , the brave warrior , former mayor of NYC , let a few tears slide down his aristocratic face . This is part of the genuineness of GMA . Nobody could be more sincere than David Hartman . He does not search you to find the tone of the interview you are looking for and then deliver what you want ; he talks as naturally with you as he has done with the President of the United States or any of his other distinguished visitors . Genuineness and sincerity can be faked , e.g. your less-than-favorite rock star who looks you right in your TV-shaped eyes and gives you her latest top-40 hit . Hart-man 's is real , but even if it were a studied effect , his preparation and background inform you the content is bigger than the style . " Working for ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most concentrated education you can imagine , " he says . " It 's like cramming for an exam every day on every conceivable subject . " Politics ( he has talked with  --  somehow it never seems like an interview ) ? heads of state , science ( medicine is a particular interest of Hartman from his days as Dr. Paul Hunter on " The Bold Ones " with E. G. Marshall and a special he once did for ABC on childbirth ) and entertainment ( Hartman is after all an actor , has been since the early Sixties when he left the Air Force as a lieutenant to become Curly in a Maine production of Oklahoma ) are all subjects which work for him because he has worked for them : " I turned my hobbies into a living . " His day begins at 4 a.m . He leaves his wife Maureen , age 32 , and son Sean , two years , for the funereal comfort of a Carey Cadillac limousine provided by ABC and driven by one Thomaselli  --  who has become " a close friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When I first started , ABC said they 'd send a car . I said , never mind , I 'll just get a cab , but they had to be sure I was going to be there , in the studio , on time , and too they were concerned for our safety . " He arrives at ABC 's innocuous , anonymous studios on the Avenue of the Americas about ten minutes after he leaves his apartment . He has spent the previous day going over a " Face off " topic on reopening the Watergate question to find out whether former President Ford had prior knowledge of the cover-up . Also , during the night , GMA 's producer has learned that the wives of the World Series players scheduled to be on " Good Morning , America " will be appearing earlier on the " Today " show . " We 'd better plan a little differently , " David tells producer Woody Frazier , who used to produce the " Mike Douglas Show " among others . They decide to hold the wives on camera longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how it affects their marriages . The wives of the losers appear dressed in black . " Oh n0000 , " giggles a stagehand who worries about light reflection on the set . In the meantime , anthropologist Margaret Mead is in the Green room , that ubiquitous closet that describes the celebrity waiting room on TV talk shows . ABC 's is painted yellow . Machine gun coffee is waiting . Sweet rolls . Consumed mainly by the hands . Mead and her equals , if indeed she has any , are more concerned with what they are going to say . David is in the barber chair in makeup . Around the walls are strangely framed photographs of Frankie Avalon , Bobby Darin and a soldier known but to God . David gets pancaked , heads for his own nook ( barely that  --  a mirror and a Formica counter with a stack of tee shirts cornered by some Right Guard and the suit or jacket he will wear for the show ) . He moves with an organized direction scarcely apparent to the associates , employers and employees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yesterday ' s plans for today 's show . Still , he arrives at the designated spot , casually , coolly , on time , but you are aware of his concentration , his preparedness . Two set members are talking about a sale of shoes  --  red , white and blue shoes , " Just perf for next 4th of July , " one says . " Quiet , " David calls . It is as natural as a father at the table , persuasive , logical . The set is quiet . David is explaining the procedure of " Face off , " a debate , sometimes mild , sometimes violent , between , for example , a government expert and a syndicated columnist , or a psychologist and a soldier , or two congressmen , one representing the automobile industry , one a ski state , on clean air , or on anything facing the nation at the moment , Social Security reform , new methods for tracking runaways , homosexuality in the Navy . " Our idea , " rattles David , who by this time is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make people aware of the problem and show them the two sides . " Then he adds , apropos of nothing , " Our guest has on a tie his wife has crocheted . " When David 's working partner , Nancy Dussault , a red-haired singer who for all her lack of news experience was perhaps as good as Barbara Walters , decided to go back on the stage , she was replaced by another friendly-faced young woman , Sandy Hill , who is as serious as the aforementioned Walters . Sandy affixes her mike to her thigh as the stagehands react with lewd but pointless gestures . The music comes up , and we hear David 's voice : " From New York , Hollywood , the Nation , Washington and the World , Good Morning , America . " The show has it covered . The program is not New York . It does n't , for example , review too many Broadway plays that are opening . The assumption working here is that there is more to the world than the Big Apple 's artistic triumphs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rhode Island , the son of a Methodist minister turned ad director for a pot and pan firm . Like his father " who said yes to life , " Hartman has miraculous and diverse abilities . He is interesting and straight ; he explores without putting on a hokey " gee whiz " face . He is fair . He listens . He lets the guests talk . He 's not a ham He 's off camera when he 's on , not affectedly so . While Steve Bell and his Washington crew potter in the political garden , a makeup girl gives David another swipe with a pad . Then she brings him a cup of water to slick down a cowlick , rubs the water all over his hair . He bends to her saying , " That 's the first time I 've been petted in months . " Then sensing the ban on saccharin , he mimics the serious newscaster 's typical expression , " ' Sink the harpoon a little deeper , ' tell it like it is . ' " Steve Bell proceeds to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " An answering service in New Hampshire manufactures tapes which imitate the voice of Marlon Brando , ' Sure , I 'll take your message . And your car , and your wife , and your house . or Richard Nixon with his famous 18-minute gap , or .. . . " The show begins pleasantly to resemble a magazine or a newspaper with humor , sports , news , gossip . The format is designed for a page turning , or as one of the producers say , " egg turning audience . " " They do n't miss the show if they can turn away in their own morning 's activities . " " A French engineering firm says the Saudi Arabians are seriously considering towing icebergs to the Mediterranean Sea ... . " Sandy 's quick bits section ends . " More than one million parents , mostly men , have run out on their children , " David comes on  --  serious , believable . " So the Department of Health , Education and Welfare has put together a computer-run locator system to find negligent fathers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Robert Fulton from HEW and Alvin Shor , a private detective agency president , as the protagonists . Toward the end , David 's voice rises : " Thirty seconds , gentlemen . " The director is winding with her hands . David appears not to see her , intensifying his talent for appearing unharried , unflustered . " Sometimes they really let go at each other , " David says , recalling some near knockouts . " We try to get provocative journalists , not propagandists . " Laughter rises from the stagehands who had unsuccessfully been urging an Irish wolfhound to enjoy a sponsor 's dog food . " It is enormous . It said in the copy it was a St. Bernard . We ca n't do anything with it . If Jack Anderson glides over the waves in his confidential voice . " Three weeks ago the Chinese exploded an atomic bomb . The radioactivity showed up.in our milk .

So keep thinking those Continued on page 81 // good thoughts . . . . Until then , this is Rona Barrett in Hollywood . " There is a book review with David and the author , a new look at the song writer and lyricist Lorenz Hart ( David sings to himself here ) . He has a fine baritone voice that saw service as the German waiter in Hello Dolly , in the national company of My Fair Lady and in an 80-city tour with the Harry Belafonte Singers . There is a moment when the show would almost break into a little soft shoe , so engaging is David pitted against the loose format . ( He also plays the violin , saxophone and clarinet , was head of the glee club at Duke where he graduated with A 's in economics . ) A film tape of David 's interview with President Carter is the high point of the program but there is n't any " Coming up next , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you spend a whole morning waiting for one thing you want to see amidst a jungle of less interesting material . The Carter interview is part and parcel of the show , not greater than but equal with . It fits but does n't overwhelm . " I flew down to Plains , " laughs David , " and got caught in a softball game . " He was once offered a professional contract with a ball club , still works out occasionally with the Mets . Erma Bombeck jollies on with " How to tell whether you 're married . " " What does having an affair mean to you ? Putting on a banquet at the Holiday Inn ? You 're married . If your husband 's best friend leans forward on the dance floor and whispers ' What are you doing the rest of your life ' and you say ' Waiting for my washer dryer repair man , ' you 're married . Or if somebody asks you if you 've ever thought of leaving your husband and you answer ' Where ? ' you 're married @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ David on the forgotten minority , the elderly , in which she outlines her plan to put very young and very old together on practicable projects , winds into Geraldo Rivera who is out on the road ( in South America ) with the Doctors of Mercy . Geraldo is youngish , hip , long-haired , soft voiced . Oddly , he reminds you of old times , the fighting Sixties , the protestors , the malcontents . But he is convincing and on his own show about once a month when he looks at Buster Crabbe on a special about fitness and says , " My , how time flies , " his sincere delivery chalks it up almost as an original remark . A discussion with a physician follows on the swine flu fiasco . Nancy then talks for a moment about Mon-dale who had said something about a general who has enough medals on his chest to signal a ship ? " people like that should n't be sewage inspectors , " says Mondale . " That 's a little strong , " pouts Nancy . " Tomorrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " says David , and the program fades from the air . You have a happy feeling , an advanced feeling that you 're better off now than when it began , you know some thing more , and you 're in a happier frame of mind , yet you do n't feel you 've been duped , or happied along . David 's handlers move him across 67th Street . At this point he seems almost a fine dog whose trainers will be putting him through his offstage paces to help create the onstage man that is worth the show . Actually , Hartman is very much his own man , a rewriter as well as writer of the show , a planner of the guests and format , and the catalyst that moves the disparate bits and pieces toward a center ; a point of view that attracts advertisers and audience . David enters to see himself on television , talking with a New York Times writer on the fading of the Mafia . Wrong , as it turns out , the Mafia is intensifying its efforts in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and out . Still , GMA does push awareness of organized crime , shows it up for some of its likelier tricks . A tape rolls for David to hear a conversation he has had with Archibald Cox . David listens three times . " This is the worst writ- ten piece ; I mean it reads like a legal documentary , " he says . " It 's written for time , it 's a mini docu- mentary , " explains the tape editor . " Oh , in that case ... " replies David , as Cox 's voice rises ... " I hoped people would remember the issue was the law , not personal- ities . " The tape editor closes David in a soundproof closet . His voice comes over , high and scratchy : " Hi , I 'm Arlene Francis .. . " Then he begins to mouth the words . Seeing the joke fall flat through the glass door , he says , " Nobody 's ever done that before , huh ? " He works with the editor , over and over . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but when we leave an hour has gone into polish-ing . And they had worked on it the day before . Back in his dressing room he washes his face , looks much better without the orange . " I felt for a long time on television you had to enter-tain , which really means not song and dance , just holding people 's at-tention , but to do it in such a way you get across all the points you want to make , that you give news without trying to manufacture it . " " Let me just call my wife first , " he says to a group of writers and producers . " Hi . Fine , how are you ? Did the baby stay asleep when I left ? That 's good . Oh man , if he climbed over me one more time . So he 's bet-ter . Not runny nosed ? " ( He turns to his small audience in the dressing room , " See , that 's all we ever talk Continued on following page continued from page 81 about , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's better ? How do you feel ? Did you see any of the show ? Did I call her Miss Mead ? I was calling her Margaret , I do n't think she minded . The wives were fun . Set up the World Series for tonight . We 're going to the office in five minutes . Bye . Yea . . . Love . " In the limousine we make the two blocks between the studio and his office in a minute or two more than it would take to walk , but this is autograph-hunting territory , and New York is not exactly a stroller 's paradise this year . The office looks out over Lincoln Center . " It 's tough , living in New York and not being able to take advantage of it , " David says . " But I have to go to bed so early and get up so early , there it is . The first ten weeks of the show , I was commuting weekends to California . " David had had parts in two big shows , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plus a role on " The Virginian . " His special on the birth of babies ( " It was the first time a live birth had ever been shown on television " ) led to his being selected for GMA . " I like New York and I 'm glad to be back . And I love doing the show . " Years ago he was a page at NBC while going to the National Academy for Dramatic Arts to study opera and ballet . One night on Johnny Carson , Ed McMahon said of guest David , " He used to show people to their seats . Now he 's got one of his own . " Ten years of touring and commercials , of singing parts and small roles led to his success . He gives you the feeling he would be no different if he had n't succeeded . " I got married when I was 39 . I just was n't ready for it , I guess . It was my first marriage . Maureen 's too . She was a television producer . Probably will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do , the challenge of it , the fun . Last week I did the show until Wednesday , then flew to Georgia , played softball , talked to the President , Miss Lillian . She drinks two bourbons every night at this crazy little cafe in Plains where she holds forth . Got a private plane to Atlanta to talk with Leon Jaworski . Home at 10:00 p.m. , did the show Friday and for the weekend played a tennis benefit for the United Negro Colleges . Usually I 'm at the office until five or six . It 's a long day , but it does n't drag . " I 've done a thousand interviews . I feel , though , I 'm really just getting started . You make choices in this life  --  that old cliche . We do n't have much of a social life , Maureen and I , but we 've always liked each other 's company . We have an Irish setter , the baby . I like to take pictures . Maureen plays the guitar . When we get a weekend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't waste time saying ' What now ? ' " The rhythm of his work has n't destroyed him . He is remarkably free of the sense of playing a role . His voice is quiet and low . He is notbogged down by the grand vision of his future , and he worries more about television , the violence and death , and the show than about himself and his career . Finally , he has breakfast , having helped America along with its morning meal . A ham and cheese with lettuce on rye , a Diet Pepsi . The show 's writers come in and over the deli lunch they work out future shows , plan changes for the next day , worry about the general drift of GMA , talk for a moment about what the " Today " show has to pay guests . " They paid John Dean $7,500 . " They ponder for a moment over the wages of sin . " CBS came up with one hundred thousand for Haldeman . Do you think we 're really going to have a war on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediate business . David is with them all the way . He is not a star who gazes benevolently on the goings on of producers , directors and writers  --  he is one of them . They do n't mind saying to him , " No , David , that wo n't work . It sounds . . . " and he swallows a minute and asks , " Seven to one ? Okay , you guys got it , " and he in turn lets them know when he thinks an idea is too much of a television cliche , too much of a great expectation that wo n't pan out . The meeting generates excitement . But there is no smugness , no self-satisfaction . They attempt to improve on the consensus . Later , he has a conference with ABC officials about a show he is producing . The rest of the afternoon is spent in " homework . " Sharpening his background so his questions will penetrate , cramming so he will know more than he can use . He does this every day , and usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ till he gets home to his apartment a little after five . " David still washes out his socks and underwear in the basement Laundromat , " his wife says . " I guess it 's the only place he can be really alone . " He was up late the night before at a dinner for muscular dystrophy , so they head for bed after dinner and a little guitaring . His enthusiasm is a valuable property . His ability to convey it to his audience is even more valuable . When he rises tomorrow morning , there 'll be a place at several million breakfast tables set for him . It wo n't make him lose any sleep though because he has already done his homework for this easygoing , thoroughly pleasing breakfast of the When the harried couple arrived at the airport with six suitcases , the husband exclaimed : " Oh , my gosh ! Too bad you forgot to take the chest of drawers in the bedroom . " " You need n't be so sarcastic , " said his spouse . " I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to be funny ? " he sadly declared . " I left the tickets in it . "
