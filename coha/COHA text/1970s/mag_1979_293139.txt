Computer records glorify sound by the binary numbers <P> That poor mutt on the RCA label . For half a century he has been sitting by the victrola , one ear cocked to the horn , checking out the sounds with the same expression on his earnest face , as if he expected the machine to throw him a bone . He has weathered considerable changes : shellac to plastic ; hand cranks to separate components ; 78 to 45 to 33 ; mono to stereo and , most recently , a skirmish with quad . There is a revolutionary change coming up , however , that bids fair to wag his tail and pin his floppy ears back . <P> Digital recording-a process that radically improves the sound of conventional phonograph records and could eventually make them obsolete-may be the single biggest sound advance since technicians discovered that two speakers were better than one . " I wo n't say when it will happen , " says RCA Records Division Vice President Thomas Z. Shepard , " but digital is definitely on its way . " Robert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soundstream , Inc. , compares conventional record listening to " looking out a dirty window : you can see , but not perfectly . Listening to a digital recording is like looking out the same window , clean . " Soundstream 's enthusiastic president , Thomas G. Stockham Jr. , who has been working on the process since 1958 and may be called its U.S. pioneer , puts it simply : " Digital recording to sound as writing is to language . A thousand years from now , digital recordings could still exist in their original quality . " <P> All this euphoria is not the moon-gazing of laboratory visionaries , nor a spiel for still another arcane piece of audio equipment . Digital recordings do sound amazingly better , even in the hybrid form available today . Recording apparatus is beginning to be widely used , though hardware for full playback is not yet available outside the lab . Even heard on conventional equipment , the new hybrid records bring a full panorama of sound rushing from the speakers . In rock , digital is like scoring a studio seat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is like a symphonic apotheosis . Floors vibrate ; paint could crack ; leases may be broken . <P> This is how it works . Even the best records available today are recorded by the analog method invented by Thomas Edison about a century ago . With analog , sound is reproduced by recording the vibrations made by the sound waves , which were collected by young Tom and his associates through a horn , and then directed to a needle pressed against a metal cylinder wrapped in tin foil . The sound waves caused the needle to vibrate and to trace a wavy groove on the soft surface of the cylinder . This is kindergarten stuff , even allowing for the introduction of magnetic tape in the late 1940s . Most music now is recorded onto tape ; when that tape is transferred to a master record , loss of quality inevitably occurs . Even if the master is excellent , acoustic impurities are picked up , the " surface noise " that frays the nerves of the audio freak like nails on slate .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
