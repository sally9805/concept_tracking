The Dow-Jones has gone down 25% since December 1968 and 7% since 1970 began . <P> Investors were despondent over the slide . The fear of a major business slump pervaded Wall Street like a chill fog . The mood conjured up the grim humor of The Bears of Wall Street Celebrating a Drop in the Market , a 19th century painting by William Holbrook Beard that hangs in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boardrooms , glum customers and brokers no longer spoke about Viet Nam .

U.S. industry 's costs are likely to continue rising , partly because labor contracts covering at least 5,000,000 workers will expire this year , the greatest number since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right after the General Electric strike had been settled ( see following story ) , was an indication of what may be in store .
