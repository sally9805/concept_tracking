THE FAN CLUB by IRVING WALLACE 511 pages . Simon &; Schuster. $9.95 . <P> <P> The Great American Theme flourishing in recent film and fiction concerns the menopausal U.S. male who seems to be burdened by mortgages , a dismal sex life and fallen arches . This sad creature takes the holiday of his dreams , literally , combining hunting and fishing with other manly pursuits , e.g. , rape , torture , kidnap and/or murder . Optional extras are sexual deviation , castration and severe mutilation , variously featured in such creations as James Dickey 's Deliverance and David Osborn 's more recent novel Open Season , a dreadful account of three top Detroit executives who each year put a man and a woman to death for sport . ( Says the jacket blurb , a searing portrait " of America in the seventies . " ) <P> Irving Wallace has always been trendy . But in his latest package he has modestly chosen to limit himself to kidnaping and rape , perhaps because the good liberal in him balks at going further . The object @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sharon Fields , she of the " half-parted moist lips " and " famous bosom . " Her captors are Adam , a lust-crazed young writer ( wearing , as writers will , " a worn gray cord jacket " and " tight blue knit slacks " ) and three accomplices , just " ordinary , average men " says Wallace , who naturally turn into " savages bent on satisfying their immediate appetites . " Howard Yost , a beefy failed insurance salesman , and Leo Brunner , a mousy , feverish little accountant , are ordinary indeed , but Kyle Shiveley , a psychopathic My Lai veteran with " thin lips " and " cold slate-colored eyes , " not to mention his " horrendous apparatus , " is hardly the guy next door . <P> Their immediate appetites receive detailed and very explicit satisfaction for a couple of hundred pages . Then Sharon , who beneath that pneumatic exterior turns out to be as resourceful as a Girl Scout , engineers the bloody downfall of her gruesome band of lovers . <P> " Body Hugging . " Wallace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " although commitment to what ( other than the survival of the motion picture industry ) is not always clear . In the past he has toiled through sex research in the suburbs , the inequities of book censorship , race and the presidency , a modern religious crisis , and the politics of the Nobel Prize . The fatty results of these labors are always an elaborate story line , with the action dictated by a clash of differing characters . The Fan Club has that kind of plot too , and the idea of a love goddess turned doughty liberationist is a nice embellishment . It is of course ridiculous , but that does not much matter in a book whose characters say things like " We do n't have a chance to fulfill such a dream , " and young Adam compares Sharon with something out of Christopher Marlowe while noting ( always the writer ) that the girl is clad in a " body-hugging knit blouse " and " abbreviated leather skirt .
