SCOUNDREL TIME by LILLIAN HELLMAN <P> Introduction by GARRY WILLS <P> 155 pages . Little , Brown . $7.95 . <P> <P> When she was subpoenaed in 1952 to testify before the House Committee on Un-American Activities , Playwright Lillian Hellman made a firm decision . She would tell committee members whatever they wished to hear about her own political views and activities , but she would not discuss the real or imagined subversions of anyone else . In a letter to HUAC Chairman John S. Wood 1 she declared : " I am not willing , now or in the future , to bring bad trouble to people who , in my past association with them , were completely innocent of any talk or any action that was disloyal or subversive ... to hurt innocent people whom I knew many years ago in order to save myself is , to me , inhuman and indecent and dishonorable . I can not and will not cut my conscience to fit this year 's fashions ... " <P> This approach seemed calculated not merely to ask for trouble but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Hellman waived Fifth Amendment protection and invited a contempt citation and jail because of her silence about others . Her lover Dashiell Hammett , who had just served a prison term for contempt , warned her that she was courting a martyrdom much worse than she imagined . He scolded , " Just remember there are rats in jail , and tough dykes , and people who will push you hard just because they like it , and guards who wo n't admire you , and food you ca n't eat , and unless you do eat it , they 'll put you in solitary . " Hellman remained obdurate . She would not even let her lawyers inform the committee about past attacks on her work by the Communist press : " In my thin morality , it is plainly not cricket to clear yourself by jumping on people who are themselves in trouble . " <P> Laconic Anticlimax . Her moment of truth with HUAC forms the heart of this slim memoir , Hellman 's first-and long-anticipated-public word on her brush with McCarthyism . Two earlier autobiographical volumes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1973 ) , ignored this subject . Yet when the crucial scene in Scoundrel Time comes , it is a laconic anticlimax . The committee seems flummoxed by Hellman 's strategy . When the chairman asks that her letter be read into the public record , Hellman 's lawyers leap to distribute copies to the assembled reporters . Minutes later a voice is heard in the press gallery : " Thank God somebody finally had the guts to do it . " More than a little bewildered , Hellman is dismissed after a mere 67 minutes . <P> Not that her troubles were over . Screenwriting jobs dried up overnight . She was forced to sell her beloved farm in Pleasantville , N.Y. , and , at a particularly low ebb , clerk in a Manhattan department store . Scoundrel Time does not dwell on these privations or , for that matter , anything else . It can be read in roughly the same amount of time Hell man spent with HUAC . Yet its understated fury is unforgettable .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
