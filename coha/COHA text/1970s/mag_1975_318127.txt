JACQUES BREL IS ALIVE AND WELL AND LIVING IN PARIS <P> Directed by DENIS HEROUX Screenplay by ERIC BLAU <P> In One , Two , Three , Billy Wilder 's cold-war farce , Horst Bucholz was held captive by ruthless commissars intent on prying secret information out of him . He resisted , at least initially . Then the villains immured him in a room with a phonograph that kept playing over and over It Was an Itsy Bitsy Teeny Weeny Yellow Polka Dot Bikini . His will frayed , his sanity shot , Bucholz broke . <P> Jacques Brel Is Alive and Well and Living in Paris suggests a similar means of torture . Imagine being imprisoned for life inside one of those actively gloomy cabarets where the only entertainment is French popular music . Whatever the glories of France , popular music was never among them . Whether ballad or brassy show-stopper or ( deliver us ) rock ' n ' roll , every French pop song sounds as if it is being pulled out of an accordion . Those who can not imagine what the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out Jacques Brel . Others might well beware . <P> Brel writes bombastic ballads about love and loss and even larger issues , such as old age , war and redemption . Brel is not modest , and neither are the people who honor him here . The songs have lots of volume but no energy or pith . The film 's notion of mise en scne is to have one number-about sons-staged in front of a trio of crosses from which dangle three uncomfortable youths . <P> The cast , in its entirety , consists of Joe Masiell , who sounds , as convention demands , as if he were chanting from the bottom of a rain barrel ; Mort Schuman , who comes on tousled and puppyish and is presumably available for comic relief ; and Elly Stone . Miss Stone is what Variety might call a diminutive thrush . She is at pains to assure us , however , that she is mighty of spirit . In every song she gives it all she 's got . In her case , this amounts to two wide eyes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ range from wringing her hands to flinging her arms wide apart , as if to guard against being crushed by invisible cathedral doors . <P> M. Brel himself shows up looking appropriately dour , cigarette hanging from the corner of his mouth in the accepted Gallic manner . He slouches over a beer and sings one of his best-known tunes , Ne Me Quittes Pas , which we might translate roughly as " Please Do n't Split . " This is the first number after the film 's intermission . It would have been more appropriate , even more poignant , if it had come just before . J.C .
