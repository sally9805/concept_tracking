The steamy British sex-and-politics scandal that forced a pair of Tory aristocrats to resign from public office simmered down a bit last week . Nonetheless , a few divertissements from the affair continued to provide London gos sips with dining-out conversation . <P> Most of the tidbits involved Lord Lambton , the Under Secretary of Defense for the Royal Air Force who resigned ( pleading " credulous stupidity " ) after an investigation had linked him to Call Girls Norma Levy and Kim Pinder . Asked by a BBC interviewer why a man of " social position , charm and personality " felt impelled to visit a whore , Lambton replied : " I think that people sometimes like variety . It is as simple as that . If a man tells another man he went to bed with two pretty girls , the man would say ' lucky dog . ' " Asked if he felt there was something like an international vice ring involved , he shrugged . " It 's a sort of international organization - like the Boy Scouts . You know , hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his indiscretions emerged , Lambton began to appear almost incredibly naive . Although he had taken the coy precaution of using a code name ( " Lucas " ) with his favorite paramour , he once arrived at her flat in a chauffeur-driven official limousine . He also paid for his trysts ( at prices ranging from $125 to $625 a visit ) with $1,800 worth of checks imprinted " Viscount Lambton " and drawn on his personal account at Lloyd 's Bank . At one point he asked his partner : " You wo n't tell anyone I come here , will you ? " Unwittingly , he was being recorded by a microphone that was hidden in the nose of his tart 's Teddy bear , while a movie camera behind a two-way mirror filmed the duo . <P> Undistracted by Lambton 's unself-conscious musings , a select Permanent Commission on Security is to begin hearings in London on reports that national security might have been violated in the romp . Scotland Yard pressed on with investigations into other aspects of the scandal . There were allegations of corruption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into what appeared to be a complicated Europe-wide web of prostitution , blackmail and extortion . For the moment , however , no more political names had surfaced-although reports persisted that from 16 to 20 compromising photos of prominent men were circulating throughout London . Meanwhile , many of the city 's better-known madams and call girls were incommunicado-as was Lord Jellicoe , the other Conservative trapped in the scandal. *
