THE TALK OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment / N the days before the State of the Union Address last week , there was a good deal of curiosity around the country about what the President might say . Ordinarily , the occasion is one in which the Union becomes briefly visible and audible in the form of the officers of all three branches of our government assembled under one roof . The President speaks , and the rest applaud , and we the citizens are reminded that , when all is said and done , we are one nation . This year , of course , with the Congress considering impeachment of the President , there were special problems . At the appointed hour , we turned on our television set , and soon it became obvious that there would be no State of the Union Address . The President was speaking , and the officers of the other branches were there , but the Union remained concealed . Intense discomfort was written on the faces of the men and women in the audience , as though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , looked as though he wished he were elsewhere . He began by describing the state of the Union five years ago . It had been poor . There had been burning cities , campus riots , war , crime , drug addiction . Now things were better . The President continued to make a series of proposals . Time slowed . At one point , the President seemed to falter and to gasp for breath , as though he could not go on . And why should he go on ? The words were without weight or importance . ( " The time has come , therefore , for a major initiative to define the nature and extent of the basic tights of privacy .... I shall launch such an effort this year at the highest levels of the Administration .... There will be no recession in the United States of America . " ) From time to time , a cheer went up from a small band of people somewhere in the House chamber . It was a particular kind of cheer , and we recognized its special sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps , from the people at the Republican National Convention of 1972 who shouted " Four more years ! " on cue . We heard it again when Gerald Ford was nominated for the Vice-Presidency at the White House . it was hoarse and loud , and went on too long . The second the President completed his prepared text , a number of senators and representatives made for the podium to escort him to the exit , but they were premature , and had to be brought hack . The President had a " personal word " to add . " One year of Watergate is enough , " he said . For a moment , he got into the details of his defense . He would cooperate with the House Judiciary Committee in its inquiry into impeachment , but only up to a certain point . And then he said , " I have no intention whatever of ever walking away from the job that the people elected me to do for the people of the United States ! " He seemed to liven up as he made his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had come to say . A part of his audience gave him an ovation , and a part remained seated . Until this moment , a shaky pretense had been kept up that what we had been hearing was a State of the Union Address . But now the occasion was revealed for what it was : a purely per-sonal transaction . All year , the Presi-dent had used the powers of gov-ernment to protect himself . He had invoked the special privileges of his of-fice ; he had fired the man he appointed to investigate him ; he had programmed his assistants and his Vice-Presidents to launch nationwide " offensives " against his opposition ; and he had taken refuge behind the foreign policy of the United States , telling us to keep our eye on what was happen-ing abroad and to for-get about Watergate . Now , in his address , he made his defense be-fore the entire govern-ment and the entire nation . Given his pre-dicament , and his un-willingness to resign , it no doubt had to he that way . In the meantime , as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justices sat and listened to what was not a description of the state of the Union but a disguised legal brief , it seemed that one man had borrowed the whole Republic and all its officers and converted it to his private , idiosyncratic ends . Rankians Unbowed AFRIEND who spent a recent Saturday at a meeting of psychotherapists in Pennsylvania sent us this report : " Most of us have heard by now of the Jungians and the Adlerians  --  to say nothing of the Freudians , from whom , in a sense , they are descended . Not so many people , I think , have heard of the Rankians . Though they are also of Freudian descent , one hears so little of them , in comparison with the others , that it is almost as if they were a dead or dying branch of the family . " The Rankians , as you may remember , are followers of the late Dr. Otto Rank ( 1884-1939 ) , the Austrian psychologist who was trained under Freud and broke away in the early nineteen-twenties to preach his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's position was this ( as he stated it in a speech at Yale in 1929 ) : ' But neither Freud nor Jung nor Adler sufficiently considers the creative part of our personality ; namely , that which is not purely biological , as Freud sees it , nor purely racial , as Jung conceives it , nor yet purely social , as Adler thinks , but which is purely individual . This I consider the most important part . ' Or , as he once said to Anals Nin , who came under his influence in the earl nineteen-thirties : ' I go beyond the psychoanalytical . Psychoanalysis emphasizes the resemblance between people ; I emphasize the differences between people . They try to bring everybody to a certain normal level . I try to adapt each person to his own kind of universe . ' " Rank , I 'm told by his present followers , was Freud 's fair-haired boy ; and when Freud became convinced that the young man was serious in what he was saying , he gave him up . Rank 's heresy ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was adopted in the nineteen-thirties 111 the Pennsylvania School of Social Work  --  probably the only noteworthy memorial to Rankianism in America  --  as the basis for a new ( ' functional ' ) approach to therapy . Virtually all the other schools of social work went on following Freud 's ( diagnostic ' ) approach . " Today , the Rankians are even fewer than they used to be . The ) are scat tered here and there throughout the country , but they are mostly to he found in the East . They are a gritty little band . They refuse to pass away . It is their conviction , I understand , that Rankianism will one day rise again  --  or , at any rate , rise  --  to claim the wide following it deserves in the field of psychutherapy . Most of the remaining apostles keep the faith in or around the Otto Rank Association , which was founded in 1965 to foster interest in Rank 's ideas , and which has its headquarters in Doylestown , in Bucks County . The founder of the Association is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Robinson was a teacher and an assistant dean at the Pennsylvania School of Social Work for many years and may he said to have raised a large number of today 's generation of Rankian social workers . " Every now and then , to help keep the flame of their inspiration alive , the Rankians get together somewhere in Pennsylvania  --  usually not too far from Doylestown , or from Dr. Robinson . The most recent gathering took place in Warrington ( just outside Doylestown ) , and I drove over , one of the members having sent me an invitation , along with a note that said , ' The meetings arc lovely little gracious affairs , somewhat wistful  --  and with a never-say-die spirit , but probably hopeless anyway . ' " With one exception , I found this to be true . I will have to concede that the Rankians are better judges of hopelessness than I am , but I can not say I noticed anything hopeless ; Nutt the latest meeting  --  not when almost four hundred of the Association 's four hundred and fifty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ member had come from as far away as California and another had travelled all the way from Mexico . " Loveliness there surely was . For example , Bucks County was having one of its better days everything washed in height sunshine , the sky a clean blue . From what I saw in the ballroom of the Warrington Country Club , where the meeting was held , I would say that more than half of the Association 's membership is made up of people in their middle age and over . As a result , perhaps , they were very courteous  --  even court . The ) seemed to me to be a gentle set of people , having no taste whatever for anything harsh . Their better selves ' a term Rankians seem to like , judging from the number of times I heard it used  --  were always On display , with the help of nothing stronger than a little fruit punch , though I must admit I was not keeping an eye on those who may have sneaked away to the club bar . During and after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  I imagine so as not to hurt the speakers ' feelings in any way  --  and the speakers themselves reciprocated by suffering the most foolish questions gladly . " The iminence grise of the proceedings was Dr. Robinson . She was horn a year earlier than Rank himself , and the fact that she had just had her ninetieth birthday gave an extra fillip to the occasion . She is short and slight of build , has sparse white hair , and is bent pronouncedly at the shoulders . But her frailness appears to conceal great authority . As she hobbled slowly on a cane to her place on the platform , most people seemed to stop talking until she sat down . When she spoke , she revealed a mind that was still very alert , and opinions that were quite firm . Once or twice , she gave orders from her chair with the easy assurance of one who does not question her authority and has little or no experience of its being questioned by anyone else . Indeed , if Rank was the father of the gathering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there regarded her as its sustaining spirit . " During one of the breaks , I went up to have a word with her , and found her much warmer and friendlier than she had appeared from the floor . Despite our small membership , I think we are doing quite well , ' she said . Associations like ours do n't really have bursts of success . What 's important is to hold things together . I knew Dr. Rank very well . He was a brilliant man , quick in his thoughts and in his movements . He talked very fast . It took all your concentration to keep up with what he was saying . His teachings developed in the United States because it was only when he came to this country that he found an audience that was really interested in what he had to say . He was a wonderful man , and we still miss him . ' " As I saw it , whatever wistfulness there was came chiefly from William G. Nagel , a former deputy superintendent in a New Jersey correctional institution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ symposium , ' The Relation of Function to Process . ' Expressing sadness over what he termed the failure of the American penal system  --  its tendency to dehumanize inmates and send them out worse criminals than when they went in  --  Mr. Nagel envisaged the day when jails would he abolished entirely and be replaced by a more humane alternative . This , we were told , is a very Rankian ideal  --  regardless of whatever prospects may or may not exist for its fulfillment . " The never-say-die Rankian spirit was introduced boldly when Dr. Robert P. Kemble , the final speaker of the day , came to the microphone . Dr. Kemble , a child psychiatrist in South Hadley , Massachusetts , and an affable man with a silvery head of hair and a Vandyke that is only slightly less silvery , acknowledged his indebtedness to Rank 's ideas of creativity and individuality . ' Rank , ' he said , ' gives us a clear dedication to what will free a soul to strike out on its own , to be the controlling spirit in its own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Dr. Kern/de  --  who shares the Rankian bias against long-drawn-out analysis  --  cleared his throat and broke into song ( composed by three Rankian associates of his , to a tune from ' H.M.S. Pinafore ' ) ' Psychoanalysis Gives me paralysis , Though I could never tell why . It cures the neuroses , But ever since Moses Men lived with them  --  why should n't I ? ' " ? SMALL admonitory sign observed in L-1 a small family-owned restaurant on the upper East Side : PLEASE Do NOT FEED THE CHILD Dylan E had breakfast Thursday morn- ing with two friends ( one blond , the other dark-haired , both recently turned thirty ) who had been to the Bob Dylan concert at Madison Square Garden the night before . " I 'll tell you some people who were there , " our blond friend said . " Yoko Ono was there . Her seat was two rows in front of Dick Cavett 's . Pete Hamill and Shirley MacLaine were there and had seats four rows ahead of Yoko Ono 's . That 's six ahead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the vicinity , and I want to tell you that this is only the back part of the front section of the orchestra Pin talking about . I could n't see the front part of the front section , where one assumes the real heavies , Yeats and so forth , were sitting . I 'll tell you some people who were n't there . There were no blacks there , and no transvestites , and there were very few people in embroidered jeans . Instead , there were extraordinary numbers of people who seemed to have come directly from registration at the New School . A very earnest group . One of my problems with old Dylan has to do with humor , you see . I do n't think he has any . Which is why the blacks and the transvestites stay away . / personally do n't trust any rock-and-roll concert without a single transvestite , but never mind . The point is that Dylan has irony  --  I mean , he knows how to milk a juxtaposition  --  but no humor . He reminds me of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bright and very ambitious and who just missed starring in ' Zabriskie Point . ' My schoolmate sang songs about Franco in the offices of our school newspaper in 1957 , but luckily he was completely tone-deaf and had to go into the social sciences . " " What 's that all about ? " our dark-haired friend said . " We 're talking about a Bob Dylan concert . Look at it from the Dylan-can-do-no-wrong angle , which is how I look at it . All through his career , Dylan has been a highly elusive figure . He always manages to free himself from the expectations of his audience . When they were expecting folk songs about the struggles of the thirties , he gave them folk songs about the struggles of the sixties . When they were expecting a revolutionary anthem with all the answers , he gave them a revolutionary anthem that was all questions . ' The answer is blowin ' in the wind ' ? was there ever a better summing up of the intuitive , improvisatory , unreflective approach of what we used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he gave them electric . When they expected funk , he gave them mysticism . When they expected psychedelia , he gave them simple country love tunes . When they finally learned not to expect anything in particular except genius , he gave them mediocrity . So . The first half of the concert felt strange  --  a little disappointing , a little disorienting . Dylan sang too fast , in a sort of strong , high chant , and he virtually obliterated the melodies  --  to no purpose . Or so I thought at intermission time . But in light of what happened in the second half of the concert , I look upon the whole first half as a necessary softening-up process for both Dylan and the audience . The room was full of complicated yearnings , after all . He was singing his old songs , and he had to avoid the dangers of a Dylan 's Greatest Hits ' atmosphere , so he recast them in such a way that you had a hard time recognizing them and a rather hard time enjoying them . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right mixture of friendliness and distance . He had to make it plain that he goes his way and others , including the audience , go theirs . " " And the second half of the concert ? " we asked . " Ali , " our dark-haired friend went on . " Dylan came out all alone , small and brave , with just his harmonica and his acoustic guitar . I was too far away to see the details of his face , but I could see his hair , curly and mousy , and that tense , crabbed stance . He sang ' The Times They Are A-Changin " and Do n't Think Twice , It 's All Right ' and ' Gates of Eden ' ? still too fast , still in that almost strangled high chant . Then , halfway through ' Just Like a Woman , ' it started to get magical , and when he sang ' It 's All Right , Ma ( I 'm Only Bleeding ) ' it all fell into place . He was still fooling with the melody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearing that song for the first time instead of the thousandth . When he sang the line about ' But even the President of the United States sometimes must have to stand naked , ' everyone cheered , of course , but they cheered even louder ? for the line ' And it 's all right , Ma , I can make it . ' After The Band came back on again , he sang a couple of very pretty new songs , and then ' Like a Rolling Stone . ' People began streaming down the aisles , and everyone stood up  --  there was no particular cue ; we just all stood up at once . Dylan 's accompaniment for the chorus was the whole audience  --  twenty thousand people singing ' How DOES IT FEEL ? ' at the top of their lungs . The houselights were turned on , so we could all see each other , and four huge klieg lights went on behind Dylan , making everything  --  Dylan , us , the music  --  seem half again as big . He did two encores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Way ( and I 'll Go Mine ) , ' much more melodic and accessible this time , and Blowin ' in the Wind . ' I 'd never heard him sing it quite that way before . He never does anything the same way twice . His voice was clear , strong , and true . He pulled it off  --  he kept the myth intact . " " Personally , " our blond friend said , ? " when it comes to mythic figures I prefer the ones like Elvis Presley , who stay mythic in spite of themselves . Dylan was never really a successful archetype , if you know what I mean . FIe was only someone who seemed to he somewhere we thought we ought to be . That 's why people worried so much about his changes of style . People worried about where Dylan was and what he was doing because they wanted to know where they should be and what they should be doing . The style changes prophesied  --  falsely , perhaps  --  some kind of movement , and that mercurial quality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But now , you see , he has run out of ways to seem some distance ahead , and has fallen hack on devices that will allow him to seem ( at all but a few carefully chosen moments ) some distance away . It 's a little sad to fight so hard for Mythic Distance . " " But that 's precisely what I like about him , " said our dark-haired friend . " He lives by his wits . "
