 | " Give me the right target and I can pull the trigger fast enough . " Reba turned away from her husband to Clasby . " He 's all wind and no weather . If you want somebody who means business , go talk to my brother , George Benson . He knows what 's good for an Indian . Do n't waste your time here . The old man 's lost his sap and the boy never had any . " Johnny stopped his reading and quickly stood . Hannah thought he was trying to take a kink out of his back . He had been bent over with his nose close to the book , trying to catch what little light there was . Instead of stretching , he went directly to his stepmother and , with his open book pressed under her chin , pinned her to the wall . " Have I got any sap ? " he asked , giving the book a forward shove that brought Reba 's popeyes farther out of their sockets . " Answer me , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth but the sounds she made were not speech . Hannah was dumbstruck . If the old man disapproved , he did n't say so . Before she could do so , Clasby rescued Reba . He wrenched Johnny away and threw the book onto the table . " You want to kill your stepmother ? " Johnny paid no attention to Clasby , who continued to hold him . " Answer me , " he shouted , as if miles separated him from his stepmother . " Have I got sap ? " " Junior , if you want a woman to talk to you , do n't half choke her to death first , " Clasby said . He helped Reba to a bench at the table and got her a dipperful of water . Johnny , as soon as Clasby went for the water , grabbed his book and ran up the stairs to the loft . Restored by water , Reba said , " Goes up like a monkey , do n't he ?

The girl 's the one doing the courting . " Hannah felt her cheeks flame up like red-hot stove lids . " I visit Johnny , " she said . " Is that courting ? " " You want to visit him now ? " Reba asked . " Want to run up the ladder and smooth down his feathers ? Tell him he 's full of sap and his mother deserves choking ? " " Stepmother , " corrected old Mr. Wood , sitting up on the bed he 'd gone back to .  | " Only mother he 's got . " Something had happened Hannah did n't understand . How could Johnny , book reader , kind to animals , turn on his stepmother that way ? " He 's never said a cross word to me . " " Did he ever say a word ? ' Cept what he read ? Well , you got a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clasby said , " We 'd better be on our way , Hannah . I 've got some other visits to make tonight . " Hannah did n't blame him for wanting to leave . Who wants to listen to fussing ? " Stop and see George Benson , " Reba insisted . " What 's on your mind is on his . " John Wood got to his feet . " They 'd ought to be run out . I got banged up on the trip here , but I can still shoot . I killed one and winged another east of the Whitewater . I ai n't got my quota this side yet . I 'd like . . . " Reba interrupted her husband as if his words were nothing but a brag . " You go and see George , Jud . " Hannah was pulled in more directions at once than were comfortable . She wanted to tell Johnny , " I do n't understand what you did , but whatever you do , I 'll love you . " She wanted to say to Clasby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been peaceful . They have n't done a thing against us . " She 'd already been called a courting girl that evening . She did n't want the men to shame her for advising them what to do about the Indians , saying , " Yes , General , whatever you order . " Old Mr. Wood made it easy for her to leave . " It was good-hearted of you , Hannah , to bring the cookies . They 're my favorites . " Kindness in the midst of all she 'd heard and seen that night was more than she could bear . She ran outside to hide her tears . Jud Clasby followed with her shawl . When February came , you thought winter 's back was broken . But February was like a snake with a broken back . It could still bite . The star Hannah had glimpsed earlier in the winter at sundown was tangled up tonight with the new moon . The little creek , running downhill to Fall Creek , sounded like summer . The frogs had got all the winter phlegm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whippoorwills . To look and listen , winter was past . But winter had another string to its bow , besides the two you could see and hear . Winter was n't a harp or a picture . It was a fire you could n't see or hear , but which could burn you . Winter , like fire , was what you felt . Winter  | could drop down out of a clear sky , sharp as an icicle , and , without a sound , pierce your heart . " You aiming to shake yourself to death ? " Jud Clasby asked . " No , " Hannah said . " I was n't even aiming to shake . I did n't know I was . It smells like spring , do n't it ? " " You put this on , " Clasby said . " No sense not being warm while you smell spring . " He draped the shawl over her shoulders . Then , as he adjusted the far corner across one shoulder , his hand brushed lightly across her breast . Hannah shuddered away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her mouth . Just because her breast tingled like nettles , that was no sign Clasby even knew he had touched her . Or that part of her , anyway . He was likely twice her age , old enough to be her father . Maybe when he looked at her the way he did he was thinking of a daughter he had lost . Any good man would be concerned about a girl 's catching a chill . Praise God she had n't screamed " Keep your hands off me . " Where was her mind , anyway ? First in love with a boy who did n't love her ; now thinking that every man who adjusted a shawl for her had other ideas than her comfort in mind . Were other ideas what she wanted him to have ? " Thank you , " she said . " I thought for a minute you were going to bolt like a skittish colt at the first touch of the saddle . " " Oh , I 've worn shawls before , " Hannah assured him . " Of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With her breast humming like a spun top , the idea crossed Hannah 's mind that they both might be thinking of the same thing . Still , she was glad she had n't yelled out , in case she was mistaken . " I had it in mind to stop at George Benson 's and the Bemises ' on the way to your place . If you do n't like the idea , I 'll take you home first . " " I do n't need to be took . I go this way alone all the time . " " Not tonight . I promised your ma I 'd see you home , and I will . I can come back to the Bensons ' and the Bemises ' . It 's about suppertime . We might get asked to put our knees under a table . " " Ora Bemis 's my best friend , " Hannah said , leaving George Benson out of it . She 'd as lief visit a bull buffalo as George ; but sitting in the presence of George and Sarah Benson for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bemis lived half a mile up the creek from the Woods . They  | had a good fire blazing on the hearth of their one-room cabin when Jud and Hannah arrived , but supper was over . " You did n't miss much , " Ora said . " Nothing but mush and milk . " Ora was a couple of years older than Hannah and she was expecting a baby . Even so , it would take two or three of her to make one Hannah , and several bleachings to get her as light-complexioned . She 'd been born with a harelip , and somebody unhandy with a needle had sewed it together . Her lip was in one piece now , but the stitch marks showed like a tattoo . Some people were surprised when a wandering dandy like Luther Bemis had taken to a girl as swarthy and marred as Ora . Some were n't . They said that a man who 'd spent ten years trapping and hunting far from all whites must 've had an Indian wife or two , and that Ora 's color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ora made Lute feel , he 'd been a changed man since he married her . Hannah knew that Lute had grown up in Ohio in the same town as her own folks . He had been saved at fifteen , but three years of walking a chalk line in the town of Blue Glass had been all his system could stand . At eighteen he broke loose in all directions at once : took up drinking , fighting , hunting ; gave up farming and churchgoing as if he had been born a redskin . After he half scalped his stepbrother in a drunken fight , he lit out west for good . For the good of everybody in Blue Glass , Hannah 's father said . In the ten years before he reached Fall Creek , he had calmed down considerably . He still looked like a rakehell instead of a Baptist elder , which he 'd become since marrying Ora , but pious living , given time , might cure that . He 'd given up drink entirely , farmed as hard as if he 'd never been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the table . Whatever he might have felt about Indian girls before he was married , he now had eyes only for Ora . He 'd have been crazy , Hannah thought , otherwise . Ora was as sleek and pretty and little as a dove . Hannah had no desire to pet other women , but Ora was so plump and lustrous she hardly seemed human  --  more like a kitten or a gray squirrel . Whatever her looks , her acts were those of a Christian woman . Hannah 's father said that Ora lived in the Light , and Hannah believed him . Married to her , any man would be willing to change his ways for the better . The two girls sat together on the deacon 's bench beside the fire . The two men faced each other across the table . Lute brought out a jug of cider and poured a mug for each . Clasby looked around for a place to spit at the first mouthful , but  | he was too far from the door or the fireplace for a carrying shot . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a helping of quinine . " Sweet cider ? I 'd rather have teakettle tea . Ai n't you got anything in the house better'n this , Lute ? " " Spring water . " " What 's hit you ? " " Common sense 's likely the name . " " When I think of the jugs you and me 's emptied ! " " We 're back in civilization now . " " I do n't call any place I ca n't get a drink civilized . " " You 're free to light out for civilization . " " Do n't get your dander up , Lute . You did n't used to be so touchy . " " I 've changed . " " That do n't take saying . Well , there 's nothing so strong as a pretty woman 's apron strings to tie a man down . " Clasby smiled at Ora when he said it , but it was a jibe nevertheless . As if before Lute had got tangled up with her , he 'd been more of a man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't likely to say before two females . Lute did n't turn a hair at the mention of apron strings . " It 's a fact . Tied the strings myself and do n't plan to ever unloosen them of my own free will . " Hannah , tied by something stronger than strings , by touch , to Jud Clasby , could n't keep her mind on Ora 's talk of baby clothes and names for the baby . She heard Ora 's words and could reply to them , but inside her head she paid more attention to what the men were saying . " We 're way off the matter I came here to talk about , " Clasby said . " Nobody 's holding you back . " " What I came here for was to ask your help in tracking a lost horse of mine . You 've fallen off in some ways , but I reckon you can still track . " Lute paid no attention to the soft soap . " What d' you mean , lost ? Strayed ? " " Stolen 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea who ? " " The Indians down at Stony Point . " " You seen any of them with him ? " " They 're smarter than that . But I seen his tracks in that neighborhood . "  | " What 's your plan ? " " Track him . See if they 've got him staked out someplace . " " I 'm through fighting Indians . " " Who 's talking about fighting Indians ? You through helping your friends ? " " I ai n't reformed that far yet . When did you think about looking ? " " The sooner the better . Tomorrow . I 'm on my way out of here and I need that horse . If you 're willing to give me a hand , meet me at my lean-to tomorrow noon . " A quarter of a mile from the Bemises ' , Hannah found that once again she had left her shawl behind her . She would n't hear of Clasby 's going back after it . It would look too much like she was asking for another shawl-fixing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I 'll get it myself . I 'll enjoy the run . I 'll be back by the time you 've counted twenty stars . " She enjoyed the run and enjoyed letting Jud Clasby know that she was n't asking to be touched again . Ora and Lute had banked the fire for the night and were saying their evening prayers when she got back to their place . They were on their knees , elbows on a bench and their faces in their hands . Lute was praying out loud , and the question in Hannah 's mind was which would be worse : interrupting a prayer or eavesdropping on a man talking to God ? Hannah decided on interrupting . " I forgot my shawl , " she said in a loud voice . Ora and Lute looked up , but neither rose . " We were just to the blessings , " Ora told her . " Join us . " Hannah 's father was the nearest to a preacher the settlement had , and praying was as natural to Hannah as breathing . It wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she thought . Before Lute had finished asking God 's blessing on all living souls in Indiana , not forgetting his yet unborn baby , Clasby had maybe run out of stars . Hannah could n't leave while the praying was going on , but the minute it was over she draped the shawl closely about her shoulders and said good night . " We 'll see you at church Sunday , " Ora said . " Look out for that Jud Clasby , " Lute warned her . " He 's a lady killer . " " Jud 's the one better look out if he tries anything out of the way with Hannah , " Ora told her husband . 25  | As soon as Hannah was down the log steps , Clasby stepped out of the shadows at the side of the house . " Were you eavesdropping ? " Hannah demanded . " I did n't think it would be polite to bust in on a prayer meeting . " " You could 've come in and prayed . " " I do n't pray . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I leave that to Christians and Indians . " " Indians ! " " They believe in a Great Spirit . I do n't see much difference . " " You 're worse than an Indian then . " " You know many Indians ? " " No . " " Judge not that ye be not judged . " " That 's the Bible . " " So I was told , back in Ohio . " Hannah shut her mouth tight . " I notice you got your shawl back on nice and snug now , so you wo n't need any more help from me . " Hannah shut her mouth still tighter . This was no subject to get pert about . She would n't have gone on to the Bensons ' with Clasby except that the Bensons lived on the way to her own home . And whatever she thought of George Benson , Sarah Benson and her six children were good neighbors . At the Bensons ' , supper was late , and they were asked to join the family meal . Four of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where they used the raised hearth as a table . The fare was good : stewed squirrel , johnnycake , and hot sweet sassafras tea . George Benson 's hair and beard were black , but with some of his sister 's red in them . When the candlelight hit hair and beard , they looked as if a fire might be smoldering deep down in those dark thickets . Benson was a big-shouldered , heavy-handed man . When he clapped a hand down on the table , the crockery jumped and the cutlery rattled . " I heard you were here , Jud . Where you been keeping yourself ? You 're just the man I want to see . I could do the job singlehanded , but two hands are always better than one  --  especially if one of the hands has had the practice you 've had . " " You mean Rocky Point and the sugar camp ? " " You been thinking about it , too ? " " I been sounding out folks . I 've about got it lined up , I think . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " What do you think I 'm here for ? " " Sparking Hannah , maybe . She needs a full-grown Hannah 's company , and her folks are the best neighbors we ever had . " Benson gave Hannah 's broad shoulder a hearty slap . " Hannah knows I 'm teasing her . Why , if I had n't met you first , Sarah , I 'd be courting her myself . " " She 's man-shy , " Clasby said . " I 've found that out . " " What man 's she known ? Father 's nine-tenths a preacher , and John Junior 's nine-tenths a girl . " Hannah wanted to sail into George Benson , talking that way about her father and Johnny . But she wanted even more to get the talk turned away from herself . " What are you planning to do at the sugar camp ? " " Break up the camp . " " Break it up ? How ? " " Quickest way would be to use a little lead . " " What harm have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the bench he was sitting on so that he could shake his fists without upsetting the dishes . " If a man asked me that question , I 'd flatten him . What harm ? They killed my grandfather . They thought I was dead or they would 've killed me . They 're animals . They 're worse than animals . Animals do n't torture each other . They bite off an enemy 's fingers  --  red men 's fingers . They cook a prisoner alive all night and eat his heart in the morning when he dies . We kill wolves , and wolves do us less harm . Nothing 's safe as long as they lurk around . There 's land and to spare west of here . What 're they doing squatting right here on our doorstep ? This is our home , not their hunting ground . Who knows what they 've got in mind ? They ought to be given their walking papers . And the only walking papers they understand is lead . " " What harm have these Indians done ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the harm they 've done . They 're the same blood as those who killed and murdered our kin . If you 're so Indiancrazy , go live with them . Be a squaw . You do n't belong here . " Hannah slid off the bench . " I 'm going home . Do n't come with me , Mr. Clasby . It 's no more than a step . Good night , Sarah . " Sarah said , " Hannah , he went through all that when he was young . 27  | He do n't know what he 's saying . You heard him say he 'd be courting you if he was a widower . " " I heard him . " " Do n't hold what he said against him . He 's out of his senses on that one subject . " " He told me , You do n't belong here . ' And I do n't . Good night , Sarah . " " I 'll see you across the crick , " Clasby said . " That footbridge is slippery after dewfall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You can have your own way . Go home alone . I want another helping of that stewed squirrel . And George and me 's got more talking to do . " In the middle of the footbridge , Clasby said , " If you make a wish over running water , you 'll get it . " " I wish I was home , " Hannah said . At the other side of the bridge Clasby said , " Now just use them long legs of yours and you 'll have your wish in five minutes . " Hannah , half crying because of what George Benson had said , was in disarray : her shawl on one side hung almost to her knees . Clasby pulled the shawl even , crossed the ends neatly ; then with one hand on each breast made a firm circling movement , ending with a soft easy touch on the upraised nipples . Hannah 's first inclination was to throw herself crying into his arms . But she 'd been called a courting girl once already that night . And was she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of love or kisses , to handle her again in his free and easy way ? She would not ask that . He could not make her ask that . But she had to do something . She hit him , half-shove , half-hit , with the heel of her hand . He was on a slope , no more expecting to receive a blow than she was to give one . It was either slide into the creek or sit down . He sat . Yet Hannah , whose sole desire had been to get home , did n't go there . " Did I hurt you ? " " No , you did n't hurt me , you damn little wildcat . But the next time you want to rassle with me , give me some warning , and we 'll have a real tussle . " " I 'm not little . " " You damn big cat . Let me know when and I 'll rassle you to a farethee-well . " Then Hannah turned and ran . The fire was banked and her father and mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her way up the ladder to the loft without light-  | ing a candle . Ben slept at one end of the loft , she at the other . There was a window at her end , a nicety given to her instead of Ben because she was a girl and glass was too scarce and precious for everybody to have his own window . The window was closed . The cabin was well chinked , but enough air seeped past the chinking to keep the loft well ventilated on a raw February evening . Nevertheless , Hannah wanted more air . She opened the window and leaned out as far as she could . She threw aside the shawl , which she had been holding as tight as a bandage about her . Her breasts throbbed , a sore aching hurt that maybe the cold air would ease . She was looking north , across the creek . There was a glimmer of light from the Bensons ' cabin . There George Benson was likely still stamping up and down the floor , or maybe laughing at Jud Clasby 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to put the evening 's happenings out of her mind and let the peace of the cool night in , the sky bright with a winter glitter and the great forests turned black now the new moon had set . She wanted to think how small she was under the distant stars and in the midst of trees stretching north and west farther than any man knew , inhabited by red men who had lived there before any white man had dreamed of them . The earth was turning round and round , and as it spun it was making a still bigger circle round the sun . She knew that . What were the circles of her two breasts , and the fire Jud Clasby had stirred up in them , compared with all the blazing circles she looked out on ? Nothing , nothing . God Himself could not care about them . What was the hurt of Reba 's calling her a courting girl and George Benson 's calling her a squaw compared with what they had gone through ? Nothing , nothing . Stand in somebody else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she told herself . Love Johnny , forgive Reba , forgive Benson , forget Clasby . There was a rustling from Ben 's comhusk bed . " Shut that window , Hannah . You want to freeze us to death ? " She would shut it , of course . Whatever Ben wanted her to do , she did . But she would wait one more minute . In that minute an owl hooted his hollow sound of water falling from high eaves into an empty rain barrel . Off in the forest , like an echo , came a softer answering cry . Indians signaled each other like that , she knew . Sounds that had meaning for them , but to a white man 's ears were nothing more than the cries of night birds and prowling animals . She pulled the window shut and went to Ben 's bed . " Did you hear that ? What was it ? "  | " An owl . " " It could be an Indian . " Ben grunted . " Listen , " he said . " All I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house . " " Could be an Indian , breathing hard , " Ben said . " Could you shoot an Indian , Ben ? " " If he was going to shoot me . " " But not in cold blood . " " No . " " They 're our enemies . " " Who said so ? " " George Benson . Everybody says so , except Papa . " " You go shoot ' em if you want to . I 'm going to leave them alone and set them a good example . " Hannah wanted to sit down on her brother 's bed . She wanted to tell him everything that had happened since she had left the house . But Jud Clasby 's touch had changed her baby brother ; it had made Ben a man . She thought twice now before throwing her arms about Ben 's neck , pressing her cheek to his and telling him all her troubles . They were n't troubles she was proud of . " Good night , Ben . " " Good night , Sis . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and knelt by the side of her bed , but she could not go through her usual prayer of thanks and blessings . All she could say , over and over , was , " Help me , God . Help me , God . " She turned her irritation at her own laxness toward Ben . " Did you say your prayer , Ben ? " " I do n't remember , " Ben mumbled . " If you do n't remember , you did n't . " " Tomorrow , " said Ben . " Tomorrow may be too late , Ben . " Ben was sound asleep .  | The next day was Saturday . Hannah 's mother , Lizzie , with Hannah 's help , spent the day cooking . Since there was no church in the settlement , settlers who were churchgoers met at the Cape cabin , where Caleb Cape ( everyone except his wife called him Cale Cape ) did the preaching . It was n't necessary to belong to any church or to have any intention of being tied down by the Ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one chance of the week to see a face that did n't belong to your own family , and to hear , in addition to whatever news might be making the rounds , one of Caleb Cape 's hairraising sermons . It was n't that Caleb was any hell-and-brimstone preacher ( though he did n't let you forget that either ) . What Caleb had that made people willing to ride ten miles , fording streams and picking their way around fallen trees and through tangles of fox grapes and sumac , was a God-blessed gift of gab . He could lay his tongue to the world and its furniture , to its inhabitants and their possibilities , and , listening to him , people thanked God that they were alive and living in such a paradise . It was usually a comedown after the preaching to ride home to a lean-to or shanty , what furniture there was full of splinters and knotholes , and all the younger inhabitants bawling their heads off for supper . Each Sunday , after the house was clear of his listeners , Caleb promised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stay and have a bite with them . But the next Sunday , elevated by his own preaching , praying , and singing , and in love with all God 's creatures , he did ask them . Lizzie wished Caleb would remember that she , also , was one of God 's creatures . Or she wondered if he believed that God 's grace would descend upon him to the extent that he could feed the multitude with a couple of johnnycakes and a half-dozen squirrels without her spending Saturday cooking . The neighbors , in any case , had taken to bringing in some food of their own , since they knew that they were going to be asked to stay  --  and that they would accept . Caleb himself , who had been doing two jobs at once outside , chop-31  | ping stovewood and boiling down a kettle of maple sap , brought her some syrup in a saucer . " How 's this strike you ? " he asked . " Depends on what you 're aiming for . Syrup or sugar ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple of hours more at the least . " Caleb drank what was in the saucer , then licked off what was left . Lizzie was thirty-four , Caleb thirty-six . They thought of themselves , and so did everybody else , as middle-aged . If Hannah had n't been so standoffish with the boys , they 'd have been grandparents by now . Lizzie had no trouble seeing herself as a grandmother . Caleb as a grandfather gave her imagination quite a stretch . She thanked God her husband had turned to Him . He was as pretty as a May apple , too pretty for a man , but so big and slab-sided you forgave him his long eyewinkers , his glossy locks and red lips . If Caleb had n't known that in the sight of God he was a naked soul , he might have been carried away by the sight of the face that looked back at him from the looking glass . If a man was n't headed toward God and His glory , a face like that could get him into a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God , he would have been like Adam in the garden : conceited enough to name all the animals and foolish enough to taste all the fruit .

Once accustomed to the upward pull of God stretching your earthly frame skyward , a man who lost it slumped down to the size of a cowpat . He was a jackanapes , a cutup , a clown . There was nothing he liked better than making people laugh . Lizzie endured and Hannah winced when Caleb , drunk with high spirits , started playing the fool . He knew he had this weakness , and held himself on a tight rein , though he did n't think that man , made in God 's image , glorified his Maker by going around looking like he 'd just bit into a green persimmon .

By midafternoon Saturday , where they were now , the love of God was beginning to fizz up in him , too high for safe corking . Since the only congregation he had at hand was Lizzie and Hannah ,  | they got the full force of his pre-Sabbath jubilation . Hannah was taking something in the nature of a pudding from the oven  --  dried pumpkin , sweetened with maple sugar thinned down with milk and thickened up with four precious eggs . " Never seen a prettier dish , " Caleb said . He tasted from the pot of cornmeal stirred into venison broth and enriched with venison chunks that Lizzie was cooking . " That 's not scrapple , " he said , " but it leans in that direction . " " February in the wilderness , " he said , " and it smells like back home in Pennsylvania at Thanksgiving time . " He picked up Lizzie , squeezed her tight , kissed her on the mouth ; then , as if finding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Lizzie squirmed in his arms like a hooked eel . " Hannah , " she reminded him . Caleb kissed her again before putting her down . " High time that girl learned that there are worse things in this world than hugging and kissing . " Hannah ran outdoors as if shot between the shoulder blades with an arrow . Caleb was proud of his strapping daughter but he did n't take any nonsense from her . " You get back in here , " he called . Hannah came in . " The day you get too fine-haired to see your father kiss your mother , you better change your religion and go live with the Romish Sisters . " Caleb was far from being all soft soap . There was a plentiful streak of pure lye in his make-up . When he came up against what he thought was wrong or just simple-minded , he let people have the rough side of his tongue . He was no namby-pamby preacher too delicate for the world the Lord had put him in . He knew Lizzie liked to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to suit his daughter . He was not coarsegrained . It had crossed his mind to say , " Hannay , if I had n't liked to kiss your mother , you would n't be here . " But there was no point in making the girl feel beholden to him for what he had done without her in mind . He wished there were men Hannah 's equal nearby . Between one slack-kneed boy and a number of loose-living hunters who 'd as soon mount a girl as spring a trap , she did n't have a suitable supply to choose from . He put Lizzie down , did n't say anything further to embarrass Hannah , and went outside . Ben , that softhearted young giant , puffed up from some business of his own back in the woods and said , " Pa , can I go hunting with Johnny Wood ? " 33  | Caleb 's folks had n't hailed in the beginning from Massachusetts for nothing .

" He kept his word . It was early twilight and they had just settled down to their supper of milk gravy and corn bread when Ben came in the door . One look at him stopped all forks in mid-air . " What happened to you , Ben ? " his father asked . " You meet a bear ? " " Maybe he met an Injun , " Hannah teased . Ben , who had been about to pull out his stool , jumped like he was bee-stung and ran for the door . He went down the path toward the privy , but did n't get there . He ran behind the woodpile , and all forks at the table were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Nothing more to come up , " Caleb said . " I hope he did n't try sampling something poisonous out in the woods , " said Lizzie . " He 's got too much sense for that . Besides , Ben can swallow two gallons of anything and keep it down . Hannah , take him a dipperful of water , " Caleb said as the retching went on . " He 'll be puking up his socks next . Water 'll give him something to bring up even if it do n't stop the puking . " Hannah carried the water to Ben . He was on his knees , his head resting against a rick of wood . He had stopped puking but his sides were going in and out like a horse 's with the heaves . " Ben , " Hannah said . Ben did n't reply . She put her hand on his back , gently , and he shuddered . " Rinse your mouth out , " she said . " You 'll feel better . " Ben 's eyes were red and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just out of bed after a long sickness . He took the dipper and rinsed out his mouth . " Drink a little , " Hannah said . " It 'll maybe settle your stomach . " Ben drank down the dipperful . The last swallow going down met the first coming back up . " Ben , is it something you ate ? "  | Ben shook his head . " Come on in . You ca n't stay out here all night . It 's getting cold . " Ben , who had been kneeling , sank lower , burrowing deeper into a jag in the stacked wood . " Let me alone , " he whispered . Hannah ran inside . " He 's sick , Mama , and he wo n't get up or move . " Lizzie half rose , but Caleb said , " If he do n't want to move , there 's no way to make him . Best leave him alone for a while , Lizzie . " No one had much appetite for supper with Ben sitting out in the dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Caleb did n't even try to bring him in for Bible-reading and prayers . " If his heart ai n't in it , he 'd as well stay out there in the woodpile . " " Maybe he 's praying out there , alone , " Hannah defended her brother . " Maybe , " her father agreed . But when bedtime came and Ben had n't stirred , Caleb said , " The boy 'll have to come in , if I have to lug him . Whatever ails him , a bout of lung fever 's not going to help . " Lizzie and Hannah half expected some struggle from Ben . Though softhearted , he was stubborn . He would n't raise his hand against anyone else , and he expected the same treatment from others . There was no struggle . After a few minutes , Ben walked into the house a step or two ahead of his father . " It 's bedtime , Ben , " Caleb said , as if talking to a two-year-old who 'll fall asleep before he gets to bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the big washbasin and put it down in front of his son . " Take your shoes off , Ben . " Ben took off his shoes and put his feet in the water . That seemed to use up all the strength he had . Caleb dropped to his knees and rinsed his son 's feet . Hannah expected Ben to either push his father aside or run upstairs to the loft . She would n't let her father humble himself that way . Ben let his feet be washed and dried by his father ; he let him throw the wash water out . He was sitting just as he had been when Caleb returned . " What 's the trouble , son ? " " I 'm sick . " " Is it anything you ate ? " Ben shook his head . Caleb put his hand on his son 's forehead . " You do n't feel hot . Touch of the ague , like as not . Now you get up to bed . A night 's 35  | His uneasiness about Ben 's state and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the morning services off in a quieter manner than customary . Usually , when about half of those expected to attend the service were in their places , he led them in singing without waiting for the stragglers to come in . This morning he had n't the heart for singing . The Woods were there , the Bensons , the Pryces , who were the farthest away of any . Luther Bemis , faithful churchgoer , had n't yet arrived . Jud Clasby , no churchman , but who had come to the meeting ( for the home cooking , likely ) the last two Sundays , was absent . Four or five families who lived in the opposite direction from those already present  --  settlers from down near the north fork of Fall Creek , and on most Sundays among the first to arrive  --  were not yet in their places . Caleb said , " We 'll put off our singing until we 're all together . " When the North Fork worshippers arrived , Phoebe Hall could lead the singing if he still had a heavy heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Twenty-third Psalm . " He was reading for his own sake , hoping the comforting words would limber up his throat and raise his spirits . " The Lord is my shepherd ; I shall not want . He maketh me to lie down in green pastures : he leadeth me beside the still waters . He restoreth my soul : he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name 's sake . Yea , though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death , I will fear no evil . . . " ' Caleb had his eyes shut . He knew the psalm by heart and was praying it rather than reading it . His heavyheartedness was easing up . He had forgotten that he had listeners ; he was speaking directly to God . A shout brought him back . " Get her out of here ! " In the open door of the cabin , carried on a quilt held at the corners by four men and in the middle by two women , lay a blood-soaked squaw . " Get that squaw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a church meeting ? " Benson shouted again . The North Fork people hesitated for a second before Caleb , with a voice more carrying than Benson 's bellow , said , " Bring the woman in . She 's been hurt . Put her on the bed . " Caleb , who had been standing on the hearth , his back to the fireplace , went to help the men place the woman he knew to be Talking  | Crow on his and Lizzie 's bed . He was sorry for the bloodstains that would be left on Lizzie 's best coverlet , but there was no help for that . He did n't value a coverlet more than a human being . The squaw had a wound near the base of her throat  --  a gaping bullet hole , by its looks . Caleb need not have worried about the coverlet . The squaw would not stay down , and no one wanted to use force on a woman whose throat bubbled bloody air as she breathed . Talking Crow first sat , then rose slowly to her feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrible bloody bubbles became larger with her effort . " You kill me , " she said in English . " I not die on your bed . " She faced George Benson . She spat at him , a bloody froth that ran down his face . " Woman killer . Child killer , " she said hoarsely . Benson rose , reaching for the wooden ladle laid out on the table for serving the hominy-and-meat stew . Caleb wrestled him down to the bench he had risen from . " George , this is a church meeting . " " Not when the savages come in . " The disturbance  --  women had screamed at the sight of Talking Crow , Caleb and Benson in their tussle had overturned a bench ? brought Ben halfway down the ladder from the loft . Even without a bloody , pulsating neck wound , he looked fully as sick as Talking f Crow . " What 's going on ? " he asked blankly . " Nothing you had backbone for , you puking youngun , " Benson said . Talking Crow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sight had cleared , she said , " You no help Folded Leaf . " Ben did not appear to hear her . He came on down the ladder as if sleepwalking . At the bottom he either missed the final step or fainted . Or perhaps both . He fell with a sodden thump of flesh onto the floor and lay there , face down . Talking Crow watched him fall . " You kill me , " she told the others . " I not die in your house . " Caleb , at her side , said , " We will help you . I promise you . " Talking Crow took her hand from the table on which she had been supporting herself and stood erect . " Help ! " Her voice , filled with scorn , came bubbling up through the blood that was choking her . Benson help up an arm as if expecting another spray of bloody spittle . Talking Crow had no more blood to waste on George Benson . " You help us die ! " She passed her hand over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pointed a finger dripping blood at Benson . " When you die , you remember . " Slowly but without wavering , she went out the door and down the two log steps . On the bottom step she gave a last cry , muffled , blood- soaked , the cry of a brave at death . Then she fell face forward and lay unmoving . Some started toward Talking Crow ; but Caleb barred the way . " I 'll tend to her  --  if she 's still alive . " He bent over and studied her . " Her troubles are over . " When the settlers started to crowd round , he said , " Do n't make her put up with what she was trying to get away from . " " What 's that ? " Luke Steffens , a North Forker , asked . " Us , " Caleb answered . Hannah , while the others were watching Talking Crow , went to Ben . He was pale , clammy , limp as a dead snake . But he was surely alive . She put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as steady as a pump bolt . She sat on the floor beside him , waiting . Everyone in the room was talking at once . Hannah tried to sort out the words so that they made sense . The North Fork folks were trying to tell where they had found Talking Crow . How they had found her . Each one wanted to tell exactly what he had done , said , felt . How upsetting it was that Indians as peaceful as those at the sugar camp had been killed . Nobody doubted that settlers had done it . The Indians were crowding in too close . If it was to be a white man 's country and people were to be free to move westward without huddling like prisoners behind stockades , the Indians had to be taught to keep their distance . Indiana was a state now , a part of the Union . She was n't a frontier settlement any more and had as much right as Massachusetts or Old Virginia to cast out the red men . Somebody had done this killing  --  how or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to all . Caleb put an end to the hubbub . " This is not the Tower of Babel , " he said . " We need to know what you saw , and one at a time is all we can hear . Ebon Hall , you tell us . " Eb Hall was the right man to call on . He was n't tongue-tied . Nor was he inclined to make an account of human hapchance sound like God 's report of the Creation . He was a long-nosed , lank-haired , darkvisaged man who looked down in the mouth at the best of times . He did n't look much different this morning . " All of us from up North Fork way was on our way to church , except for the Bushnells , who 're always late . The weather was so good everybody walked . We come along  --  well , you all know the trace we follow  --  a hundred yards or so from Stony Point and the sugar camp  | there . There was no one around . I did n't think anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know about in their comings and goings . " About a couple of hundred yards  --  well , you all know where the Talbot Jessups first settled . Dug a well because they were afraid they 'd get milk fever from the spring stream . Then filled in the well when they pulled out . It was right there the Bushnells caught up with us , and right there that Maggie Bushnell said , I hear something . ' " Well , you can always hear something in the woods , but we stopped , listened . It was a human voice . Sick or hurt . We followed the sound to the Jessup well . The stuff the Jessups had put in it had sunk . Now it 's more of a sinkhole than a well . Kind of a deep saucer . The voice was coming from there . From down under a lot of dead bodies we saw when we got there . " " How many ? " Titus Andrews asked . " I 'm coming to that . We pulled out the bodies one by one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The woman we brought here was at the bottom of the heap . I do n't know how she breathed there . Let alone lived with that hole in her neck . " " Where are the two bucks ? " Cyrus Shannon asked . " I do n't know where they are . All I know is what I 've told you . Three women , four children dead in the sinkhole of the old Jessup well . " " One woman was alive , you said . " " Half alive . You seen her . " " How 'd they been killed ? " " Shot . Beaten . " " What 'd Talking Crow say when you pulled her out ? " " She did n't say a word . Except for the groaning , I 'd of thought she was dead . She did n't really come to ' til we carried her in here . " George Benson got to his feet . " Why did you bring her here ? Why did n't you leave her where she belongs ? With her own kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for her husband . " She 's an old woman . When I 'm an old woman I do n't want to be left to die like that . " Benson had an answer to that . " She 's an old woman for sure . She 's the mother and grandmother of men that killed my folks . She 's likely hacked white prisoners to death with her own hands . I killed her , or tried to . Those redskins been asking for what they got . We warned them not to move in here so close . They take the best of the skins and game . None of us would be here except our fathers fought off the Indians . We going to let 41  | them push us back ? Leave our children to fight battles we ought to fight ? Where 's our backbone ? They been warned year after year at Stony Point . They got from here to Texas to hunt . Do n't tell me they do n't have a scheme to get their foot in the door , open it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us come pushing in like wolves . I shot the old squaw . The time 'll come when you 'll thank me for it . Next year you 'll see that the redskins keep their distance . And you 'll all breathe easier . " The minute George Benson sat down , his sister , Reba Wood , jumped up . " Every word George says is true . But one thing he left out . He did n't do it all singlehanded . " Benson called across the room , " I was n't meaning to hog all the credit , Reba . But in this sort of thing , every man 's got the right to speak for himself . " " Well , my husband 's one to hang back when it comes to claiming credit . I 'll take some of the blame for that . John 's older than me , as I guess you all know , and I 've kind of got in the way of speaking up for him . Well , I want you to know he was right there at Stony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brother George . Young John did his part , too . And if any of you been wondering if that boy was ever going to grow up , stop wondering . He growed up yesterday . Fought like a man . If he was here , he 'd blush to hear me say so , but it 's the pointblank truth . My two men gave every bit as good account of themselves as brother George . Ca n't praise them higher than that , can I , George ? " Hannah , who had been huddled over Ben , half hearing , did hear Reba 's last sentence . She lifted her head and called out , " What did you say about Johnny ? " Reba replied , " I said Johnny fought like a man . Killed Indians with the best of them . " Hannah , not believing , asked , " Johnny did that ? " " You been doing your best to make a man of him , ai n't you , Hannah ? Well , what you could n't do , the Indians done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blooded . " " I was n't trying to get him to kill anybody . " " A man finds his manhood the best way he can . Some one way . Some another . " Ben , hearing the argument , if that was what it was , pulled himself , unnoticed , back up the ladder to the loft . Ebon Hall said , " I ai n't concerned about John Junior 's manhood . He wears pants , so I reckon he 's got some . What I worry about is 42  | what Colonel Johnston , the Indian agent 's going to do about this when he hears about it . " " How 's he going to hear about it ? " Benson asked . " Do n't you think for a second Indian runners wo n't have the word to Johnston by sunup tomorrow . " " Who 's in charge of this country ? " Benson shouted . " Indians and their softhearted agents or us ? Move in with the redskins if you 're so sweet on them , Eb Hall . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be missed if the tribes to the north take it into their heads they got a little revenge coming . " Benson erupted violently , like a wounded bear . " I never thought I 'd live to see the day when men of my own country and color would take the side of Indians against me ! " " Come on , George , " Reba said . " I know when I 'm not wanted . Let 's clear out of here . These folks want to have a powwow , not a church meeting . " " You 're right , Reba . The place has got an Indian stink . " George and Sarah Benson , their six children , and the two Woods left the meeting  --  before any prayer had been said , any song sung . " Judge not that ye be not judged , Ebon Hall , " Benson called back through the open door . A hot gush of feeling ran along Hannah 's veins . Her father , his church , and God Himself were being discredited . She sprang to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being a church . But it 's still Sunday , and if we pray , maybe God will forgive us . " Caleb and Lizzie urged upon their neighbors the food they had brought , but the neighbors left their food behind , as if it , too , had been sullied by what had been said and done . " We 'll pick up the pans later . " The Capes were n't hungry either . Ben lay on his bed , refusing to move or to talk . Lizzie had gone up to reason with him . They had some idea now of what ailed the boy . Caleb and Hannah carried Talking Crow to the bed of the wagon . There they put the bloody quilt over her and fastened it down at each corner with a rock . " We ca n't leave her here , " Hannah said . " For a while we can , " Caleb answered . Hannah asked no more . Caleb was too upset to stay home . " I 'm going to walk over to Stony Point , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what happened there . " 43  | " Can I go with you ? " " What you 'll see wo n't be very pretty . " " I know that . " It was a three-mile walk , with no cabins except the Mungers ' , up on a knoll a quarter of a mile off the trace . Nothing but the woods , there like they 'd always been . They did n't have to fight through underbrush . Fires over centuries had burned leaves , saplings , brush , leaving only the great trees : oak , walnut , hickory . The sycamores towered over all . Sugar maples were plentiful . That was the reason the Indians had returned each year to Stony Point . There were poplars , from which the Capes ' own house had been built . But all the building and clearing that had been done around Fall Creek made no more than a nick in the forest that covered the ground thick as grass in a water meadow , westward and westward clear to the sunset . The trees were n't leafed-out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was the kind of weather , as well as the day of the week , to rejoice in . Caleb 's feeling for Sunday made him reflect . He said , " It should 've happened on another day . " Then he took it back . " The day do n't matter . The deed makes the day , not the other way round . " Hannah said , " Reba drove Johnny to help George Benson . " " How do you know that ? " " I heard her . She told Johnny he was a weakling . She shamed him into doing it . " " There are other ways of proving your strength . " " That 's the way that come up first . " There was no arguing with Hannah about Johnny Wood 's reasons for doing what he did . If he did anything . They had nothing but Reba 's word for that . Caleb missed the praying and singing of that morning 's Lord 's Day service the way another man would miss a meal or a night 's sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Instead of worshipping , neighbors had quarreled ; his own son had been struck down in a fit of remorse of some kind ; the blood of a dying woman was on his floor ; her body lay in his farm wagon . Before the afternoon was over he 'd likely see more bodies ; not bodies killed on a battlefield , but squaws and children struck down in a sugar camp . His mind was split three ways , divided among what had been , was , and would be . He remembered the dying woman , her look and words . While he remembered that he also saw a raccoon peer out at him from the hollow of a tulip tree . A pair of eagles sat motionless at the top of a lightning-blasted sycamore . Squirrel chatter was louder than bird 44  | song . But more vivid than either the present he walked through or the morning just past was the imagined scene toward which he advanced . The afternoon was warm to sweating . He was still in his winter underwear , and would be , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come . Cased in by wool , his sweat was not summer 's thin and cooling wetness but the thick bad-smelling dampness of exertion and dread . Why was he plodding toward what he dreaded to see ? The dead would n't be helped by his presence . The sight he was searching for would n't purify him . Near the sugar camp they saw four buzzards soaring in the sky . " I do n't like the look of those birds , " Hannah said . " They do n't have anything to do with what we 're going to see . They 're a quarter of a mile or so away . " Before they reached the camp , at the half-cleared place where the Jessups had lived before they pulled up stakes and went home to Ohio , Caleb sighted what he 'd come to see : the bodies pulled out of the sinkhole of the well and sprawled where they 'd been laid in the haste to get at the woman who still lived . For a minute Caleb could n't continue . " Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . Hannah faced away from the bodies . She stared at an old beech tree as if her life depended upon memorizing the shape of its scars and the number of its limbs . " You go first , Papa . " " There 's no call for you to come at all . " She listened to her father 's retreating footsteps , then ran after him . " I do n't want to be left alone . " Hannah had never seen death before . She could n't remember the little brother who had died when she was young . At first sight these dead were as lifeless as boulders or stumps . They were forest litter , dead branches to be stepped over . As she came closer they became human beings asleep in awkward positions . They 'd wake up numb , their legs full of pins and needles . All except Folded Leaf . He was not asleep . He was not forest litter . He was a boy she 'd seen playing in the creek , sleek and brown as an otter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any more . Where his face had been there was a clot of offal like she 'd seen at butchering time when the job had been botched : torn flesh , splintered bones , blood , and what she supposed must be brains . They were tidier with hogs . 45  | A pain sharp and sickening , of the same kind she 'd felt when Ben had split his toe open with an axe , went through her . It started under her heart and ended someplace ha the region of her crotch . It was sickening , sour-sweet ; nothing short of fainting or puking would relieve it . " Look the other way , Hannah . " She wished she 'd never left the beech tree . " Ben saw this ? " " Saw it done , maybe . " " Johnny ? " " We do n't know . Nothing 's for sure yet . " " But Reba said . . . " " That woman 'd say anything to get attention . " " Where were their men ? Hunting ? " " Indian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with sense does . " " Why did n't they help ? " " How do I know ? " Caleb was exasperated with his daughter . This was no time for chitchat . The old Jessup place was melancholy enough without dead bodies . Somebody had tried here and given up . Headed west with hope , then backtracked east , defeated . They had dug a well to save their girls from the fever a spring creek was said to give . And the girls had died from drinking well water . The Jessups had filled in the well to keep livestock from breaking a leg ; now the filling had sunk down far enough to provide a hidden nest for dead bodies . Newcomers had helped themselves to the logs of the Jessup house . The stone chimney still stood , a bare backbone ; the pole-fenced cowyard had not been disturbed . It was a place most people stayed away from . It put them in mind of what might be in store for them : death and defeat . The old Jessup well had been the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was a short haul from the sugar camp and a place to which nobody came . The grave markers for the two Jessup girls were up at the top of the rise , facing southeast toward Ohio , where they 'd been born . Caleb was sorry for snapping at Hannah . Her wonderment about the Indian men had been natural . He could figure it out in only one way . " The men were ambushed , " he told her . " I 'm going to take a look around . You do n't need to come with me . " She needed to . She could n't stay there alone with the dead bodies . 46  | But the dead bodies went with her . Her father was tracking , reading the message of footprints and trodden leaves and broken twigs . She could n't fasten her mind on what was underfoot . It was filled with the images of the dead who had been flung out of the well in order to  | get to the one who still lived . She could see the young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the waist , her skin white , each breast bullet-punctured . Somebody 's gun had said , " Do n't be white , do n't have breasts like those . " With her own blood that gun had made her a redskin . The older Indian woman 's calm had not been disturbed by death or by being thrown into a well and then hauled out again . She lay on her back , her eyes closed . She took no heed of what the whites had done . A little girl had her arm wrapped around her stomach . Hannah knew what the words were she could not hear . " It hurts , it hurts . " Her father spoke , ridding her mind of those pictures of the dead they had just left . " There he is . " She followed her father 's pointing finger . There he was , up the trace ahead of them , kneeling , forehead to the ground , a man in prayer . But he was a dead man , his shirt black with dried blood . The sight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of pain she had felt when she saw the others . She could not see this man 's face . He appeared to have knelt down , tired of being . He had had enough of life , had drawn his last breath and put his forehead to the earth . " Shot in the back , " said her father . " Tolled away from camp on some trumped-up excuse so they 'd be free to finish off the women and children . " " There were two men , " Hannah reminded him . " The other is probably nearby . Hannah , I know you got the strength for it . Have you got the stomach for it ? " " I can do what has to be done , " Hannah answered . " I 'm not going to leave these people laying around here like scraps thrown out for dogs to chew on . I 'm going to put them back in the well for tonight . Tomorrow I 'll bury them and Talking Crow . You 'll have to help me carry Tall Tree . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ca n't heft a man his size . Dragging him would tear him to pieces . And me , too . " Caleb took the bulk of the load . Even so , Tall Tree 's legs angled downward in Hannah 's grasp . A moccasin dropped from his foot . " Papa , " Hannah called , then shut her mouth . What did Tall Tree care now whether he had two moccasins or one ? He would n't be 47  | walking again . Hannah staggered under his weight . The effort kept her mind off the burden she carried . A dead man . A few drops of blood oozed from the wound in his back onto the hem of her dress . She saw them strike , and spread , but went grimly on . Red Cloud was where her father had thought he might be  --  in the opposite direction and about the same distance from the camp . Shot in the back like Tall Tree , but face down , a man taking his rest . He was lighter than Tall Tree and easier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first , then the women , and finally the two men . Caleb figured that was the way the men would want it . " That covering of branches wo n't fool any animal hungry for fresh meat . The men were n't much help at the sugar camp . They 'd want to take the brunt of it now , if the worst comes to the worst . " It was full dark when they got home , bloodstained and bone-tired . Lizzie did n't pester them with questions until they 'd washed and changed . They sat down to the good food that had n't been eaten at midday , and that they had n't the heart to eat now . " What did you find ? " Lizzie asked when she saw there was going to be no eating . " Just what George said we would . Dead Indians . " " All dead ? " " Every one . " " Women and children ? " " Women and children . " " There was a fight ? " " No signs of that . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than cold . Planned . I 'm going back in the morning to bury them . " " That 'll be quite an undertaking , Caleb . " " Ben can help . " " Ben 's still sick . " " I can help you , " said Hannah , " if Ben 's still sick . " " You done more than a girl 's share already . " " I know who 'd help , Papa . Luther Bemis . I was at the Bemises ' when Jud Clasby talked about the Indians moving in too close . He wanted Lute to help drive them out . But Lute said not to count on any help from him . He was through killing Indians . He 'd be just the one to help you now . "  | Caleb took Hannah 's advice . After the supper he could n't eat , he walked the half-mile to the Bemis cabin . It was a cold clear night after the warm clear day . There was a quarter moon for light . Owls hooted , their voices ricocheting among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hooter was behind you or ahead of you , or one or a dozen . Indians knew this , and whites , fooled by their imitations , moved on unsuspecting to be slaughtered . The Bemises had no candles lighted , no fire burning . The light through the one curtained window was dim . Caleb thought twice about rousing them up if they 'd already gone to bed . While he was thinking it over , Ora called out sharply , " Who 's there ? " " Cale Cape , " Caleb answered . " If you 've gone to bed , I can come see Lute in the morning . " Ora herself unbolted the door . " Come in . We 're not in bed . Lute 's feeling poorly , but I 'm up and wide awake . " Ora put a couple of sticks on the fire and seated herself in the rocker , hunched up in her wrapper like a bird in cold weather . Caleb stood , his back to the fire , facing the corner bed , where Lute lay face to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bedclothes . " Nothing serious , I hope . " " He 's been resting and dozing all day . He ca n't hold anything on his stomach . But he 's got no fever . By morning he 'll be good as new , I hope . " " I missed , you both at church . " " We missed coming . But Lute was in no shape , puking and shaking , to put in an appearance . And he did n't want me to make the walk by myself . " " It 's just as well you did n't try  --  in your shape . What happened would n't have been good for the baby . " " What could hurt a baby at church ? " " We did n't have any church . The folks from North Fork brought in a half-dead squaw from the sugar camp . She said a few words and 49  | died . Benson and old Wood , or at least Reba Wood , admitted they 'd done it . Boasted about it 's nearer the truth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're all dead , men , women , and children . A couple of dogs , even . Hannah and me went up there . " Ora said nothing . Caleb went on . " I reckon you 'd ' bout as well 've come to church as hear it all spelled out like this . " Ora said , " No . Words are easier to take . You saw it ? " " Hannah and me together . " " Hannah 's got a lot of grit for a girl . " " No more per inch , I reckon , than you . " " Did she tell you about being here with Clasby ? " " That 's why I 'm here . " " Clasby was here with Hannah night before last . Lute 's known him from away back . Jud talked then of wiping out that camp  --  he was trying to recruit Lute for the job . He did n't say so in so many words , but Lute and I both knew what he was up to . Lute told him he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down peaceful Indians had no part in it . " " That 's what Hannah told me . That 's why I 'm here . I 'm going to give those folks a resting place underground , not leave them out for wolf bait . I 'll need some help in the digging . I come , knowing from Hannah how Lute felt , to get his help . " " He 's so poorly , " Ora began , but Lute himself interrupted her . " I 'll be at your place tomorrow at sunup , Cale . I ai n't too poorly to know my duty . I 'm throwing this off gradually . I 'm better now than I was this morning . " " If you do n't feel like it . . . there 's been enough dying around here without you catching lung fever . " " I 'll feel up to it . Did anybody at church mention Clasby ? " " Nobody . Reba was so anxious to claim all the glory for her men , nobody else could get an oar in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " She died before she 'd had her full say . " Lute , with an unexpected movement , threw all the bedclothes aside and stood tall and white in his long underwear . " Pray for me , Cale . I missed church today . I ai n't so steady in the Light as I 'd like to be . I need help . " Caleb said , " There was no church to miss today  --  as things turned out . " 50  | " Where two or three are gathered together in His name , " Ora reminded them , " that 's church . " So the three had a little church of their own then and there , and Caleb walked home easier in his heart than he 'd been since morning . Caleb and Lizzie were at the breakfast table next morning when Ora arrived . She would n't eat , said she was too dauncy of a morning nowadays to hold down solid food . " I come to tell you Lute 's had a setback . He 's feverish now and got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming . I 'm in no shape to be a widow . " She was the only one who laughed at her own joke . She would n't eat , she would n't linger . She would n't hear to anyone walking home with her . " The walk 'll do me good . " There was a cold drizzle of rain , but Ora had a shawl , she said , that turned away water . " The baby 's snug , " she assured them , " and Lute needs me . Outsiders upset him when he 's sick . He was out of his head for a while last night after you left . All that talk of killing was too much for him . " She had her own way . There was no means short of rassling her into taking somebody 's arm , or of tracking along behind her like a man running down a deer , to see her home . " That rain 'll be sleet in another hour , " Caleb said , as he watched her leave . " Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had left . " She wo n't do anything to harm that baby . " " Sounds like Lute and Ben both been hit by the same complaint , " Caleb said . " Do n't say that , " Lizzie urged . She 'd lost one son with a fever . The first thawing days of spring were the most dangerous of the year . More deaths then than from lung fever in the depths of winter , or from the bloody flux in a torrid summer . Caleb put his hand on Lizzie 's . " I do n't think it 's a killing sickness Ben 's got . He 's going with me this morning . " " Did you have to threaten him ? " " I told him he had to go , if that 's a threat . " " Ben being what he is and you what you are , I reckon it was . " " Oh , he 's willing to go . Now that Lute 's under the weather , I 'll take Hannah , too . She can dig circles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say that so 's Ben can hear . " 51  | " I ai n't saying it so he can hear . " " Ben needs back-patting . With Hannah for a sister , always running faster and digging deeper , he 's had a hard row to hoe . " " Hannah 's carried Ben around on a chip since he was born . " " That 's part of the trouble . He needs to do something on his own . " " He 'll have his chance today . This rain 'll freeze before it lets up . I do n't mind digging wet ground , but frozen ground 's something else . " " You sure this has to be done , Caleb ? " Caleb rose from the table . " Sometimes I think women spend so much of their store of tenderheartedness on their families they ai n't got a smidgen left for the outside world . Yes , I 'm sure it 's got to be done if I 'm to sleep nights . " Caleb went to the loft ladder . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaving in fifteen minutes . " Brother and sister came down at once , Hannah first , then Ben . Nobody , unless it was Hannah , had had a good look at Ben outside the gloom of the loft for two days . A day and a half had gone by without his eating . Missing three or four meals did n't show up on a boy whose bones were as well covered as Ben 's . But something showed up on him . He was tallow-colored , as pale as a man with the ague when the fever dies down . His hair hung down lifeless as a sick cat 's . It was combed , though , his shirt buttoned , his back ramrod straight . He looked like a man ready to walk to his own grave . When the corn dodgers and syrup were put in front of him he shook his head . " My stomach 's still unsettled . " " You ca n't work on an empty stomach , son . " " It 'd be empty , anyway , the next minute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a family way , are you , Ben ? " " Caleb , " Lizzie protested , " that 's no joking matter . " " With Ben , I figured it was , " Caleb said . " Ben , you got some reason you 're not telling us for not wanting to help me this morning ? " " I want to help you . I 'm going to . I never said not . " " If you can work without eating , we been wasting a lot of good food on you these past few years . Hannah , I 'm going to need you after all . Luther Bemis 's sick . " Ben said , " Maybe he drank too much . " " Now , none of that kind of talk . " Caleb sat on the floor of the wagon to keep the body of Talking Crow from rolling about ; and the grave-digging tools from clattering.  | This was , in a sense , a hearse , and the squaw had suffered enough already without going to her burial with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to drive ; some small job might keep his mind off whatever was eating at him . Hannah , her arms folded tight inside her deerskin cape , held her chin down , trying to take the force of the rain , which had turned , as Caleb had prophesied , into a nasty sleet , on her cap and forehead . The sleet , before it melted and ran off , stuck to their faces like a kind of cold slimy gravy . Skim-ice was already forming on the roadside puddles . No wheels had turned into the old Jessup place for a long time ; but the ruts made by earlier Jessup comings and goings were still plain to be seen . " Up there by the old well , " Caleb directed Ben . Before they were there , he saw that the branches he and Hannah had put in place so carefully lay scattered about . Caleb was out of the wagon before Ben could pull up the horses . He did not find what he had expected : that animals had been at the bodies of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work of animals . Indians had been here . All the bodies were gone . There were tracks of moccasins and unshod horses about the sinkhole . The hair on the back of Caleb 's neck rose as his skin tightened . Decent burial for a dead Indian was one thing . The presence of live Indians was a different matter . " Get down in the wagon bed , " he yelled to his children . He peered into the trees . He scanned the gaunt fireplace . Was there any movement behind it ? He was here on a mission of mercy : to give decent burial to a woman he 'd had no hand in killing . Those were facts , but no Indian would care about any fact but the color of his skin . He was white , and white men had killed red men . Let white men die , they 'd argue . He thought better of the command he had given Ben and Hannah before the words were cool in his mouth . If redskins were still about , revengeful as redskins were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the foot-high sideboards of a wagon . " Hannah , Ben . Come here . " Hannah , there first , exclaimed , " The bodies are gone ! " " I 'm glad they 're gone , " Ben said . " They did n't just go , Ben . Somebody took them . " " How did they know where they were ? " Hannah asked . " These woods are full of Indians . They keep pretty good track of each other . " " Will they be back ? " 53  | " What would you do , Ben , if you came home and found your mother and me and Hannah scalped ? " " You have n't been doing anything wrong . " " What 's wrong with a half-dozen Indians making maple sugar ? " " They were doing more than that . They were trapping the streams empty . Deer were twice as hard to find . " Ben was coming out of his shell , and Caleb did n't want by any word of his to drive him back into it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added defiantly . " They 've trapped here and bored trees here before we ever set foot in America , let alone Indiana . " " That 's Indian talk , Mr. Benson said . " " If you want to stay alive , you better try to figure out the meaning of Indian talk . " " I did n't do anything . " " Nobody said you did . But try telling an Indian with a tomahawk , I was there and did n't do anything , ' and see how long he listens to you . " " You got a gun with you , Papa ? " Ben asked . " You know I have . I never leave the house without one . But this is a burying party , not a shooting party . Only there 's no point burying now . The Indians 'll be back for Talking Crow . Save them and us both trouble just to put her back in the well and cover her up . " " Do they know where she is now ? " Hannah asked . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gather up the branches . I 'll carry Talking Crow to the well . " Hannah , while Ben and her father put Talking Crow back where she 'd been found , walked up toward the sugar camp . The sleet had slacked off , and the air was colder . The sky had not cleared . If those black clouds held more water , it would be hail by the time it reached earth . She was n't frightened by her father 's words about Indians . Since Friday evening she had felt that the course of her life had gone out of her hands . Nothing she had planned had happened  --  unless there was some planning so deep in her it was hidden from her knowledge . She counted the days : two whole days , Saturday and Sunday ; the evening of Friday and the morning of Monday . Few hours , yet in that time either she was a changed girl or she was only becoming acquainted with the girl she really was . On Friday she had gone to Johnny Wood 's home her heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours later she was willing to let Jud Clasby walk off with her breasts in his hands . On Sunday morning , she had seen a dying squaw spitting blood on churchgoers , and she watched without falling down in a swoon . In the afternoon she had dragged dead men to their graves , then gone home and washed as calmly as if she 'd come in from milking . Now she 'd been told Indians might fall upon them at any minute . She still felt calm . If it was to happen , it would . She stumbled , without noticing where she was walking , onto what she took at first to be a boulder . It was boulder-colored , all right , a big deerskin bag stuffed tight and the top held close by a rawhide drawstring . Burned in the skin were the initials J. C. ? Jud Clasby . Instinctively Hannah put her hand to the initials , then drew it slowly across the soft suede bulge of the bag . It was his . He had carried it . It was filled with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face , but the smell was only of leather and hides . The bag was almost as heavy as a man . She carried it slowly back to her father . Caleb and Ben had once again carefully covered the sinkhole with boughs . Her father , who never swore , said when he saw her , " In God 's name , Hannah , do n't go wandering off that way without letting us know . Things have changed . You could 've been scalped by this time . Do n't you know that ? " " You told me so , " Hannah reminded her father . " Well , when it happens , " Caleb said , " I do n't want to be the last to know . What 've you picked up ? " Hannah pointed to the initials . " J. C. Jud Clasby 's belongings , I reckon . " " Where were they ? " " Up toward the sugar camp . " " Ben , was Clasby there ? " Ben looked at the ground . Caleb stared at his son . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know that . But the sooner you tell me what you know , the better it 'll be for everyone . You included . " Caleb untied the drawstring of Clasby 's bag . What spilled out was none of Clasby 's belongings , but the best peltries of the Indians ' trapping . Caleb took them out slowly , one by one . Between skins there had been packed a few knives , beaded decorations , and small bowls . Clasby had skinned the camp of its valuables . When the bag was empty , Caleb gave the mound a small kick . " Thievery , " he said . 55  | Killing Indians was one thing . Robbery was another . Killing Indians , like it or not , was the only way they had survived . Picking off redskins had n't endangered anyone but the redskins who got picked off . But stealing endangered them all . Benson could boast and expect approval when he said he had rid the countryside of a few more red men , but " I stole " was a confession nobody was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his children this . He left the bag and its contents where it had fallen . " Wo n't the Indians find it ? " Ben said . " Let them , " said Caleb . " It belongs to them . Alongside the bodies they 've already found , this wo n't cut much ice . " " They 'll know who did it , " Hannah said . " They already know . They were likely chasing Clasby when he dropped his bag . " " It could just 've slipped off , could n't it ? " Hannah asked . " It could 've . Clasby no doubt was in kind of a hurry . " The three of them sat wedged together on the wagon seat going home . It was hailing now , little stinging pellets not much larger than grains of sand . The horses , Acorn and Oak , so named by Caleb because one was the father of the other , one little , one big , walked with lowered heads and at a good pace , barn-eager . No one spoke . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rattled around on the floor of the wagon . Hannah sat between her father and brother trying to draw herself up into a knot of unfeeling flesh  --  not against the hail , but against memory . On a single day she had been ready to clasp two different men : one a murderer and the other a thief and murderer . That 's the way my nature turns , she thought . She was riding with her eyes shut and would not have known that they had turned into their own lane except for her father 's wild shout and the sudden jerk of the wagon as it was stopped by horses being pulled back on their haunches . She opened her eyes to see her father already halfway to the door of their cabin . " Ben ! Ben ! What 's the matter with Papa ? " Ben pointed . An arrow was planted in the door , not lightly , but sent with force and standing almost straight out . " Lizzie , Lizzie , " Caleb was calling . Hannah , jumping clear across Ben 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mama , Mama ! "  | Lizzie herself opened the door , alarmed by all the commotion . " Caleb , what 's happened ? What 's the trouble ? Is somebody hurt ? " Caleb grabbed his wife in his arms . Hannah circled round , patting both . She had something she could cry for now without having to explain , so she sobbed , " Mama , Mama . " " Oh , thank God , praise God , " Caleb said . " For what , for what ? " Lizzie asked . Lazarus raised from the tomb had caused less of a fuss , she thought . " You 're sure you 're all right ? " " I may have a cracked rib soon , " Lizzie said , " if you do n't let up your hugging . But I was pretty sound ' til you got home . " Caleb loosened her arms . " You did n't see or hear anything ? " " I heard the sleet and the hail . I was up in the loft changing the bedclothes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , things needed freshening . What was there to see or hear ? " Caleb pulled his wife out of the doorway and closed the door . 1 Lizzie , when she saw the arrow , did n't sway or scream , but all the color went out of her face . " You did n't hear or see anyone ? " Caleb asked . " Not a soul . The hail on the roof 's noisy . I was n't looking out the window . What 's the meaning of it , Caleb ? " " I thought the meaning was I 'd find you scalped . " " That 's why you took on so ? " " Well , I was relieved , " Caleb said , " when I saw you with your hair . " Caleb 's tendency , when stirred up , was as strong to joke as Hannah 's was to cry . Ben , who had got the team into the shed out of the weather , asked , " Did somebody shoot that to tell us they 'd be back ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They do n't warn you , Get ready , we 're coming . ' When they 're ready , they come and are gone , and the first you know about it is your hair 's missing . Other parts , too , sometimes . " " Would a white man do that ? " Lizzie asked . " Just to scare us ? Someone who did n't like the idea of your going to bury the Indians ? " " Well , there 's no call not to like us for that . We did n't bury them . " " Why not ? " " They were n't there . " " Indians ? " " There could n't be anyone else . " Lizzie looked at the arrow again . " Is there any need for us to be standing out here in the hail ? " 57  | " No , " said Caleb , " there ai n't . " It took a hard tug to get the arrow out of the double oak door . It had been sent with enough force to go through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belly muscles to the guts . It was an arrow of the old days , feathered with red hawk tail and tipped with chipped quartz . Caleb turned it over in his hands . He could not help admiring its beauty . It was the nearest to a bird a man had ever made ; but man , when he made a bird , made a bird of death . It flew to kill . Its song was a scream . It hatched blood and the blood gave birth to worms . Caleb handled it gingerly : dead snakes still had poison on their teeth . When they were all inside , Lizzie , who now was as upset as she had been calm , bolted the door . Caleb stood in front of the fireplace turning the arrow in his hands . " Bum it , " Lizzie begged . " Burn it . Break it in two and throw it in the fire . " " No , I ai n't going to do that , Lizzie . I 'm going to keep it . In the first place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The killing part will last after all of us and this house , too , have gone to dust . In the second place , it was sent to us by a friend . " " It was sent to us by an Indian , was n't it ? " " I judge so . But he sent it as a warning . " " What makes you think that ? " " There 's no other way to think . Indians never been ones to sit back and watch their women and children shot down . If ever there was an eye-for-an-eye people , they 're the ones . And they do n't warn you before they take their revenge . Somewhere there 's a friend saying , Look out . " " Who , Papa ? " Hannah asked . " I do n't know , Hannay . " Caleb put the arrow on the mantelpiece with the pewter candlesticks , the daguerreotypes of Lizzie 's father and mother , and the picture little Caleb had drawn the week before he died . Lizzie would just as soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but too remindful of past threats to be pretty . " I just do n't know who , Hannay , " Caleb repeated . " I just do n't know . I know somebody thinks we 're in danger and has warned us . Considering what 's been done , that 's more than we 've got any right to expect . " " We did n't do anything . " " We 're part and parcel , as far as Indians are concerned , of the murders at the sugar camp . "  | " Murders , " Hannah repeated , shocked . " Is killing an Indian murder ? " " If all he 's doing is boiling a pot of maple sap , I do n't know what other word fits . " Lizzie knew where this kind of talk would take Caleb with their neighbors . They 'd forgive Caleb a lot because he was a preacher and had , because of his calling , to swallow whole such commands as " Thou shalt not kill " and " All men are brothers . " They expected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but after Sunday was over they would n't cotton to his calling them murderers because they had sent a few redskins to their happy hunting ground . They 'd call him Indian lover , and worse . Say he was on the side of men who had scalped and burned his own kind  --  and ought to grow a scalp lock and start eating roast dog . But Caleb knew this as well as she did  --  and she was n't a woman to try to put words in her husband 's mouth . It was still storming after they 'd had an hour 's rest and a bowl of hot bean-and-venison soup : snow , sleet , rain , hail , everything that can come down from heaven but tadpoles and spiders . Nothing violent , but constant , cold , and wet . " It 's not going to let up , " Caleb said . " Now 's as good a time as any to go . " " Go where , Caleb ? " Lizzie asked . She thought the burying trip was expedition enough for one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bodies were taken . Let them know somebody warned us there 'd be trouble . I ca n't do less for them than that fellow did for us . " Caleb picked up the arrow and turned it over and over in his hands like a letter he 'd read once , but whose meaning required a second scanning . " Put that down , Caleb , " Lizzie said sharply . She 'd as lief see him fondle a scalp . Caleb did so . " Ben , you take Acorn and let everyone on the east side of the creek know what 's happened . I 'll go up the west side . " " What am I supposed to say ? " " Not a thing but that the bodies are gone . And that someone put an arrow in our door . " " Then what ? " " Then , nothing . Get home . If the weather turns worse , if a blizzard blows up or it starts snowing hard , stay wherever you are . " 59  | " When 'll you be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Before nightfall . " " Is there danger ? " " I would n't be leaving you if I thought there was . Not now , anyway . Once the news gets north , there may be all hell to pay . " " And you wo n't blame the neighbors ? " " I never said that . " " Saying it to the neighbors wo n't help anyone . " " Lizzie , if I 'd never said anything except what 'd please the neighbors , I 'd be tongued-tied by now . " " One day 's trying wo n't strike you dumb , " Lizzie said , but knew the advice was useless . Ben was home an hour before his father . He 'd followed orders , delivered the news , then sent Acorn home through a clattering spring thunderstorm at a pace that the old stud did n't know he still possessed . Caleb , though later than Ben , kept his word . He was home before candlelighting time . After an early supper , Caleb shooed the children up to their beds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your mother , " he told them . " You 've both had a big day . Now , scat . " He did n't himself go to bed that night . Oh , he took off his outer clothes and stretched out now and then beside Lizzie , who had her nightdress on and was under the covers . But for the most part he stood in front of the fire , which he kept burning with a daytime brightness , and rehearsed what had happened and what he thought he should do . After he knew what he thought , he was accustomed to weigh his conclusions against Lizzie 's convictions . Lizzie was no " as my husband says " woman . He listened to her , knowing that . So when Lizzie disagreed with him , her convictions had to be strong . So far she had listened with only a question or two about what he had said . " The Brewsters , " he told her , " are already packing to move into Pendleton until this blows over . " " There 's no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty miles southeast , and that much nearer other settlements . And there 're two hundred people there instead of twenty . Of course , the Bensons and the Woods say that arrow was n't a warning of any kind . Just somebody trying to throw a scare into us. "  | " Why us instead of them ? " " That did n't come up . I reckon they think we scare easier'n them . " The wind rose and there was a letup in the sleet . No wind could shake a house built of logs , but it could find breaks in the chinking . Fingers of iciness reached into the room . The wind whine got louder . Caleb put two more logs on the fire . " Did n't winter ever enter our head when we come north ? " Caleb asked . Lizzie could n't be turned aside by questions like that . " Do n't it enter their heads that what they did may stir up the tribes to the north ? " " If it does , they do n't let it be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they done was just the warning needed to persuade the redskins to keep their distance . " " Were n't they grateful to you and Ben for riding out in this storm to tell them the bodies had been taken ? " " Nobody 's grateful for bad news . " " Even if the news might save their lives ? " " Nobody except the Brewsters think it could come to that . Or 've got sense enough to understand what Indians on the warpath can do . They 're all so used to these peaceful sugar-camp , calico-buying folks . They think a handful of trinkets and a jugful of rum would settle things . " The word " trinket " reminded Lizzie of something . " Hannah told me about Clasby . Did Benson do anything like that ? " " Steal , you mean ? " Lizzie nodded . " I saw a few things at their place I never seen there before . " " Did you say anything ? " " By the grace of God , I kept my mouth shut . " Caleb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forth in front of the fire . The wind died down and the room was filled with the soft owl-feather swish of falling snow . Lizzie dozed off . Caleb stretched out beside her for a while . Lizzie woke somewhere near her usual time  --  before daylight . Caleb was up , dressed , and had a kettle boiling and cold sliced mush frying in the three-legged spider . Lizzie , wondering how she could oversleep at a time like this , threw off the covers and pulled on her wrapper . " What time is it , Caleb ? " " Four . " " No need to be up so early on a day like this . What can you do ? " 61  | " I 've thought about it all night , Lizzie . I 'm going to Piqua . " " Piqua ? That 's two hundred miles . " " That 's where the Indian agent is . " " Colonel Johnston ? What can he do ? " " I do n't know . But if Brewster 's right , Johnston 's likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 're thinking of making a sweep down here . " " Why do n't you wait ' til you can get the advice of the neighbors ? " " I know what their advice would be . Stay home . ' I intend to go . It may be a fool 's errand . The Indians up north may not have any notion of coming down here for the sake of a passel of Senecas and Miamis they never laid their eyes on . In that case I 'll have made my ride for nothing . On the other hand , they may be painting their faces this very hour . They may limber up their tomahawks on Johnston 's skull first of all if he tries to stop them . But if they 've got thoughts of coming down here , Johnston 's the one man who has a chance of talking them out of it . I ca n't sit home here and gamble that ai n't the case . " " Wait ' til the weather moderates , " Lizzie urged . " That 's the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time for the Indians to get a band together for an attack . If that 's what they plan , they 'll wait for better weather . And I wo n't . " " ' Bout as well stay home and be scalped as go out and die in a snowbank . " Caleb laughed and did n't know why . " No , I 'd choose the snowbank any day  --  and take you with me , if I thought that was the choice . But I 'll tell you something , Lizzie . I ai n't got no choice about making this ride . And I 'm not intended for snowbanks , nor you for scalping . We 're going to have to tough it out along more everyday lines . " The fried mush was overfried and the sassafras tea had steeped too long . Lizzie could n't swallow a bite , and Caleb did n't want to . He filled himself full anyway . He was n't going to fizzle out for lack of fuel . When he had finished he said , " I 'm going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hannah , at the sound of her name , was awake . Caleb sat down on the edge of her bed and kept his voice low . No use rousing up Ben . " Hannah , I 'm going to ride to Piqua to tell the Indian agent there what happened . I do n't know just how long I 'll be away . I would n't go if I thought there 'd be trouble here . "  | " Trouble ? " Hannah whispered . " Indians . If there is , if you get enough warning , get your mother and Ben into Pendleton . If there 's no warning , give up . Do n't fight . You would n't stand a chance anyway . " " I 'd rather die fighting than just die . " " You and Ben are young enough , if you do n't fight , they 'll likely adopt you . " " Make a squaw out of me ? " " Yes . " " Marry me to some Indian ? " " There 's been more than one child adopted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ families when they had a chance . Indian ways would n't come too hard for you . " " Maybe not , " Hannah said . " Maybe I 'm already part savage . " " Stop that kind of talk . You 're a Christian girl . The Indians already worship a Great Spirit . Maybe it 's God 's plan for you to teach them who that Great Spirit is . " " If we do n't fight , what 's to become of Mama ? " Caleb did n't answer . Hannah said , " They 'll kill her , wo n't they ? " " They 'll kill all of you if you try fighting . Burn you alive in this house . None of this is likely to happen , Hannah . I would n't be leaving if I thought it would . I told you because I trust your good sense . " " I do n't know 's I 've got much , Papa . " " You 've got enough to know that what I 've told you 's true , do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father down the ladder . There , with Lizzie , they knelt before the fire , and Caleb prayed . " May the Lord watch between me and thee while we are absent one from the other , " he ended the prayer . Then he folded Lizzie in his arms , kissed her , and talked to her in a voice so low Hannah could n't hear what he said . He kissed Hannah , called her " Hannay , " as he did on special occasions , and gave her a hearty handshake . " Ben 's too young and your mother 's too ladylike for the job , so I appoint you man of the house while I 'm gone . " Hannah wanted to cry , but the appointment she 'd just received made that out of the question . She and her mother stood tearless in the doorway as Caleb rode south , gray in the first gray light , his chin low on his chest against the heavy sleet . 63  | About ten o'clock there was a heavy rapping on the door . Hannah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had left for Ben 's use and start shooting . She felt ashamed of the way she had kept her father 's trust when she heard George Benson 's unmistakable shout . " You home , Mrs. Cape ? " " We 're home , " Hannah answered . " Mama 's coming . " She opened the door herself , thankful she had n't riddled a neighbor with squirrel shot . Jess Abernathy , a tall man , part Indian himself , people said , who lived a mile or so beyond the Bensons , was with George . He was farther away from the settlement than anyone else ; for this reason , or maybe because he was n't a believer , he and his family never came to church . Lizzie , who had felt dauncy all morning after the wakeful night and Caleb 's early departure , was back in the corner half hidden by the bed curtains , finally getting into her day clothes . She did n't come out ' til firmly buttoned and neatly combed . The men , wet from the icy drizzle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first backside , then frontside to the heat . " Mrs. Cape , " Benson said , his voice cracking a little , " where 's Cale ? " " I do n't know . " " Do you know where he 's headed ? " " Yes . " " To Piqua ? " " Yes . " Benson turned to Abernathy . " You were right . Why would he tell you and not me ? " " He knew you 'd raise a ruckus . " " You 're not backing down , are you ? " " I 'm here , ai n't I ? " " My husband is going to Piqua at the risk of his own life to see if the agent there will quiet the Indians . He told you what happened , did n't he ? " Lizzie asked . For so big a man , Benson was very light on his feet . He pranced . He gave the table a slap Lizzie knew he would rather have given her husband . " The agent ! The agent ! Whose side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been doing lately has been babying the Indians . But that man Johnston in Piqua outdoes them all . He carries them around on a hand-carved chip . We got to pay for our land . Not the Indians .  | They get it free . While we 're clearing the land and putting in crops , they hunt and fish . We get what 's left over . All they got to do is whine , Oh , Great White Father , help us . ' And the Great White Father takes money out of the till we put there and says , Oh , noble red brother , thank you for asking . ' " What do we get free from the government ? Not a cent . They 're all minted special for red brother . I tell you , you got to be the right color nowadays if you want to be heard . " And now Cale runs off to this Indian lover to get help . What this Johnston will do is to get us forbidden to drop a hook in Fall Creek or trap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Caleb 's risking his own life in this weather to try to save your life , " Lizzie said sternly . Benson snorted . " There was no call for Cale to be so all-fired unselfish . Preachers would be better off to stay home and pray . Not ride off , mixing in what they do n't understand and stirring up more trouble . Cale was n't satisfied to leave matters in the Lord 's hands . Oh , no . Cale wants a finger in everybody 's pie himself , the Lord 's included . " Hannah grabbed the heavy twig broom and swung it in a semicircle that caught Benson across the side of the head . " What 's going on here ? " he shouted . " You lost your senses ? " " You get out of here , that 's what , or I 'll knock you senseless . " Benson made a move toward Hannah , but Abernathy took his arm . " You ca n't fight a girl , " he said . " The preacher 's girl . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hellion . She 's been prayed over too much and thrashed too little . " Hannah , using the broom as a battering ram , shoved Benson toward the door . " You get out of my father 's house before you say another word against him . " " I 'll get out with pleasure . But I 'm going to ride after your father and I 'll bring him back before he ever lays eyes on Piqua and that Indian lover over there . " Hannah closed the door with a bang , then set the broom in its place by the hearth . " He ca n't catch Oak . He knows that . He 's just talking big , " she reassured her mother . 65  | Hannah was right . Abernathy talked Benson out of even trying to follow Caleb . " He 'll never make it in this weather anyway . " Caleb made it ; but not in the three or four days he had planned . Far later than his imagination might have stretched his delay , a matter of many weeks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't in . Caleb knew the agent by the color of his hair . The official behind Johnston 's desk was a dark-haired , sallow-faced young fellow who looked as if he 'd never been out from behind that desk . He was the man , Caleb supposed , who looked after the papers while Johnston was out along the rivers and in the forests looking after the Indians . That was what Caleb hoped . This clerk would never be able to hold his own in any Indian powwow . There were only three chairs in the room  --  a chair with arms behind the desk and two straightbackers against the wall opposite it . Indians preferred the floor to chairs . The young clerk leaped to push a chair toward Caleb , thinking maybe that a tattered woodsie like Caleb might never have seen such a contraption before . " Have a seat , sir . You look pretty peaked . " " I been sick , " Caleb said . " I still feel like I been pulled through a knothole . " " Got the shakes ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though , was the grippe . I set out in a storm from the Fall Creek settlement . " " How near 's that to Pendleton ? " " Twenty miles north . More or less . " " That 's where the trouble is . " " What trouble ? " " Have n't you heard ? " " I have n't . I left home in a snowstorm to see Johnston . I came down with what I thought was the grippe but what turned out to be lung fever . I 'd of died except for a family outside Winchester who took me in and dosed me and nursed me . I was in and out of my head . I thought I was there two weeks . They said three . Might 've  | been four weeks , they were so set on making out I had n't been a burden to them . " " Was n't a mite less than four weeks , " the clerk said . " Maybe more . There 's been more than Indians killed now . " " Where ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Creek ? " " No , no . Fifty , sixty miles north of there . You from the Fall Creek settlement ? " " I told you so . Anyway I thought I did . I started on this trip to tell Johnston that nine Indians had been killed at a sugar camp there . " " We got that news right after it happened . " " How could you do that ? " " Indian friend of Johnston 's , Black Antler , sent a runner . " " What did Black Antler want ? " " Same as you , I reckon . Get Johnston to smooth down the Indians up north . " " Can he do it ? " " If he 's there , he can . But the news of the killings beat him there . The tribes up north , when they heard what happened , burned a couple of homesteads and killed everybody in and around them . " " That 's what I want to stop . That 's what I came here for . " " You could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Johnston himself did n't have power to quiet the tribes ' til the government promised that the men who murdered the Indians would be tried and punished exactly the same as if they 'd murdered white men . " " Murdered , " Caleb repeated . " Murdered . " He remembered Hannah 's shock when he had labeled the killings murder . " What else is there to call it ? " " I never heard folks call it that before . A white man 's killing an Indian . " " What you heard  --  or did n't hear  --  do n't change facts , do they ? " " No . What I heard or did n't do n't have any bearing on the facts . But it 's got bearing on the way I feel hearing it now . " " You 'll likely hear it more often from now on . " " Who is making this promise that there 'll be a trial ? Governor Ray ? " " You folks up there in the woods do n't really know our governor very good , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Well , the governor knows that , all right . He 's figured that out 67  | without help . You woodsies vote . The Indians do n't vote . Governor Ray is not about to call voters murderers , ' or take any risk of losing a voter at the end of a rope . No siree , Bob . Our governor knows which side his votes are buttered on . " Caleb was beginning to think this clerk might not be such a bad man at a powwow after all . He had a tongue limber as any Indian 's ? and maybe an Indian 's staying power . " If it 's not the governor who 's making the Indians these promises , then who is ? " " Say , how long did you say you 'd been sick ? The United States government , that 's who . Calhoun , the Secretary of War . Calhoun ai n't a man to daily . " " Washington 's a thousand miles away . " " An Indian runner can make a hundred miles a day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Indians who got a personal interest in seeing those killers tried . The promise that there 'll be a hanging if the men who killed their women and children are found guilty put wings on their feet . " " The Indians have heard a lot of promises . " " They 'll believe Johnston . He 's never broke his word to them yet . When he says these men are going to be tried , they 'll believe him . " " They may believe him  --  but how 's Johnston going to do it ? He ca n't go down to Fall Creek singlehanded and set up court and start trying people . " " Do n't you think Calhoun knows this ? He 's already sent word out to track down the murderers . The burnings and killings up north was n't wasted on the folks where you come from . Better a few men in jail for what was done than the whole settlement wiped out by a bunch of whooping painted savages . Captain Berry did n't have the least trouble getting the accused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got a jail . " " You got one now . Or Pendleton has . They built one on purpose . " " Who 's in it ? " " Their names ? I do n't know . But it 's occupied , and the accused are awaiting trial as soon as the circuit court meets there . " " Those men do n't have money to hire lawyers . " " Calhoun knows that . The Indian Bureau knows it . Seven thousand dollars have been set aside for this . Three of the best lawyers from Ohio state are on their way to Pendleton right now . The regular state prosecutors will handle the case against the murderers . " " They ai n't murderers ' til they 've been proved murderers . "  | " What 'd you make this trip here for ? " " To report some killings . " " Well , we 're now acting on the report you were going to make . " The contents of Caleb 's stomach started roiling about . It was a sunny day , but cold , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the desk warm did n't do much for the spot where Caleb was . He was sweating as much as though hoeing corn in July . He could feel the drops run down his sides and stop where his britches belt caught them . He 'd soon be in a puddle from the waist up . He had n't come here to get his neighbors thrown into jail and accused of murder . He 'd come to save bloodshed , not cause it . " You feeling all right , mister ? " " No , " Caleb said . " I think I 've had a setback of some kind . I feel dauncy . " He sat down heavily . " I was aiming to start home this afternoon . I think I 'd better plan to lay over a day or two . Is there a good boarding place in town ? " " Mrs. Holland 's the best . You might have to share a bed . " " My cough 'll scare off bedmates . " He leaned forward with his head in his hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming on . " Has any white man ever been convicted of murder for killing an Indian ? " he asked finally . " Not to my knowledge . " " But that 's what Johnston 's up there telling the Indians ? White men will be tried for murder ? " " Yes . " " And if guilty ? " " You 're sick , Mr. Cape . You know what happens when a court finds a man guilty of murder . " " These Ohio state lawyers ? The defense ? " " I told you . The best . Calhoun 's no Ray , vote-hungry . But he do n't want it said that these whites were found guilty as a sop to the Indians . " Caleb stood , but there were no floor boards beneath his feet . He was standing on air . He sat down quickly . The chair was made of air , too . He could n't feel it . He was floating above the chair , about to float right off in a heap onto the floor that had melted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real thumbscrews , bored into his shoulders . The chair firmed up under him . Caleb looked up at the man supporting him . " Do I know your name ? " 69  | " Hardesty , Jacob Hardesty . " " Thank you , Mr. Hardesty . I was weaker than I thought . " " Mr. Johnston keeps some Kentucky corn here . A glass might do you good . " Caleb nodded . " I need something . " Hardesty brought him a brimming shot glass . " You ai n't joining me ? " Caleb asked . " I do n't drink . My body is the temple of the Lord . " " Mine , too , " Caleb said , " but the Lord would n't care for a temple as shaky as mine . It needs building up . " The drink did its work . He could feel the floor under his feet and the chair under his bottom again . " I do n't drink , Hardesty , " he said , " except for medicine . I 'm a preacher . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Nothing sets me a better example than a drunk . You all right , now ? " " I think I can walk . I do n't know what to think about what I just heard . I rode down here to get Johnston to stop the Indians from raiding the settlement . What I 've done is to get my neighbors thrown in jail for murder . " " You did n't do that . Black Antler and Mr. Calhoun did that . " " Who got here first ai n't going to cut much ice with men in prison accused of murder . " " A preacher 's got to take a stand for the right . Ai n't he ? " " He ought to , " Caleb agreed . He ought to , he surely ought to , he thought . The man who killed a man ought to be hanged . He had never doubted that . But wispy old John Wood , henpecked in life and hung up by his chicken neck to die ? The Wood boy , who had no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , big ox of a fellow who needed somebody saying gee-haw and whoa to him if he was to be kept on any straight path ? Hang them ? Praying churchgoers ? And he the one , no matter who got there first , who went to Piqua to carry the news to Johnston . What was he ? Some kind of a Judas ? He asked Hardesty , who seemed to have an answer to everything , the answer to that . " What would you do if you was in my shoes ? " Hardesty did n't have to think twice about that . " Move my family back to Cincinnati . " " We 're only a hundred miles away from there now . What 's a hundred miles ? "  | " Going some directions , nothing . Going your direction , north and west , a hundred miles is a long time . We went through all you 're going through years ago . " " A man 's got a right to push on . To live where he wants to . " " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Caleb took his first good look at Hardesty . He had a face as smooth as a pebble at the bottom of the falls on the creek . Fifty years ago was a story long past to him . Why anybody would ever want to live that story over again was something Hardesty would never understand . 71  | Hardesty was not exaggerating when he told Caleb that the federal government was supplying the accused men with superior counsel . Up from Ohio to Pendleton came Patrick Conroy , Noah Beazley , Isaac Vickers , and Charles Fort . All were accomplished and experienced : able , eloquent , and capable of taking a jury 's mind off the facts of the Indian killings under consideration by powerful reminders of past Indian atrocities . They were lawyers , and lawyers with every intention of winning a decision for their clients . They were also men of a city called " Queen of the River , " a substantial community that had earned its stability , they believed , by conquering the Indian population . This little settlement of Pendleton , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amidst bands of roving red men , would never be safe until it had done the same . If they could help it , no white man was going to be hanged for trying to protect Pendleton in the same way their own forebears had protected Cincinnati . These men had on their tongues ' tip accounts of massacres of whites by Indians that would make this little sugar-camp fracas look like what it was , no more than a backwoods frolic . Before any jury decided the fate of these patriots , they would have to listen to a little history . Before the Ohio lawyers were through with them , the jury would hear the story of Daniel Boone and Simon Kenton . They would be told of the battle of Blue Licks and Bryant 's Station ; they would hear about the blood shed there by white men , scalped , mutilated , mangled , by reds . They would be asked to remember the defeats of Braddock , St. Clair , and Hamar . The federal government had one paramount purpose : it had no intention of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that this was a powwow called to belittle the red man . The defense lawyers were well known . They had to be . But the prosecution lawyers were famous . Heading them was General James Noble , former soldier and Indian fighter and now a United States senator . The Secretary of War had  | given him permission , and money , to fee an assistant . Noble had chosen his own son-in-law , Abel Trask , a young lawyer with the reputation of being able to charm the rings off a raccoon 's tail . Jonathan Armitage , the state 's attorney , had also been given an assistant , Oscar Achilles Dilk , a black-haired , bullet-headed young man with a mind like a bear trap and a jaw the shape of a Shawnee 's battle-axe . Dilk was obviously headed for the Senate . And barring slip-ups , the Presidency itself might be just around the corner . The Indian agent , Colonel Johnston , would be present during the entire trial . He would see that witnesses showed up when needed and that their fees were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chiefs and lesser chiefs , the Mingos , present when possible to observe the trial and send the news back to the tribes : " White men are being tried for murder for killing Indians . It is a fair trial . If found guilty , they 'll be hanged . " Charlie Fort , the youngest of the defense lawyers , twenty-four on the twenty-fourth of December ( he thought this signified something ) of 1823 , had drawn the best lodging in town . Drawn , he knew , was not the right word . There was no lottery , no choosing by means of long and short straws . He had been offered , by the widow Culligan , the loft room in her Pendleton home . She had ignored the general ; ignored Patrick Conroy , originally , like herself , from the old sod ; given Noah Beazley , the very picture of a dark and handsome city lawyer , the go-by . She had offered the room to Charlie because , she told him , " You look like my late son . " Charlie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reminded them of their late husbands . Reminding a widow of her late son was more to his liking . He moved into the widow 's loft room at once , without wasting time or pity on his fellow lawyers . They , the general among them , were piled two in a bed in less commodious lodgings . The feathers of the ticking and comforters he slept between smelled sweet and fresh . Some heat spilled into the room from the fireplace chimney that took up one end of the loft . He had that frontier luxury a looking glass  --  spotted , to be sure , like a pond with lily pads  --  but between the spots he could see his own face . He doubted he looked like the late son . " Charles Fort , " he had been told , " you 're an oddity . " Not a mud-fence , ugly oddity . Kisses had told him that . But no one else 's spit and image , for sure . He was dish-faced , with a head of fine black hair that a brisk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , big , round , and set shal-  | low in his head , were the color of water in a rain barrel , neither blue nor gray . His nose did n't have much of a bridge , but it made up for the lack at the top by flaring out into race-horse nostrils at the bottom . He bared his teeth to the glass . Nothing lacking there . He could bite with a beaver . He was longheaded and a trifle lanternjawed , but his long head was set on a stud-horse neck , a neck broad as his face at the cheekbones . The looking glass did n't show him below the Adam 's apple , but he knew what was there : a body wideshouldered , spare in the short ribs and waist , and supported by thighs heavy and meaty , like his neck . " I 'm no Adonis , " Charlie admitted to himself . But who needed looks when he had luck ? He got good horses at livery stables , helpings from the first serving at boardinghouses , and whiskey from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taverns . The Secretary of War himself , or at least the general , had asked that he come to Pendleton on this historic case . The widow offered him her spare room because he , with a face like no one else 's , looked like her son . When his family had been killed by Indians as they were moving from Kentucky to Ohio , he , the sole survivor , age two , had been found , carried into Cincinnati , and adopted there by the man he thought of as father , Enoch Leverett . Leverett had sent him east to Harvard , where the bright Yankee boys went , planning for him to take over the Leverett newspaper , the Western Spy , when he graduated . In spite of himself , Charlie turned out to be a lawyer . A newspaper writer has to tone things down ; Charlie had watched Leverett do this for years . A lawyer could tear the rag off the bush , could tell the jury facts that would lose an editor every subscriber he had . Charlie 's mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that and so made use of what Charlie could do : send him facts that he could cut , dress up , water down , add to , until they were fit for print . Beneath the spotted looking glass , when Charlie had moved into the room , was a deal table holding washbowl , pitcher , soap dish , and drinking glass . The room had no washstand . The chamberpot was under the bed . Charlie took all this paraphernalia from the table , moved the table under the loft 's one window , and had himself a desk . He brought a rush-bottomed chair upstairs , put his paper , newly sharpened quill , and newly mixed ink on the table , and sat down to write Enoch Leverett what he had promised , a report of this outlandish place and of this outrageous trial . He knew the Western Spy was n't interested in how Charlie Fort 77  | was making out amongst the woodsies and redskins . He did n't begin his writing with " Dear Pa . " That would lead him into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ redheaded girl he had seen who had made him want to follow her into the green gloom of the unending stands of trees the way men run after fox fire in a swamp . He wrote in what he considered a newspaper style , but for a newspaper whose sole reader was Enoch Leverett . He said Pendleton had a population of two hundred souls , not people . That was newspaper lingo . But he could n't bring himself to substitute " we " for " I. " " We saw . " What other pair of eyes saw what he saw ? No , he was n't that much of a reporter . Extracts from a letter by Charles Fort to Enoch Leverett : Pendleton is a town of two hundred souls . I made the mistake when I first arrived here of calling Pendleton a settlement . The Pendletonians wasted no time setting me right on that score . A settlement is a place like Fall Creek , twenty miles upriver  --  no stores , streets , or taverns there . Pendleton is a town . My idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three thousand books in our library , board walks , street lights . I doubt if half a dozen books could be scared up in this entire settlement . Excuse me , I mean town . Excluding , of course , the Good Book . They own that , even if they do n't always follow it  --  as the recent murders prove . On my first day here I was told that I was expected at midday to take dinner with Judge Giddings . Three judges sit here : a presiding judge appointed by the state legislature , and two elected associate judges who are local . The presiding judge is Amos McGowan . Giddings , a man much respected here , is one of the associate judges , as is Omer Oursley , the town blacksmith . Oursley ironed the prisoners after they all climbed over the walls of the prison stockade on the first night of their incarceration . Nobody here , including the prisoners , takes this trial very seriously . They look at it as a kind of playparty tableau to impress the Indians . Wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He intends another kind of party . Oursley appears to be a good man with hammer and tongs , but he ca n't read or write . Ezra Fenton , the clerk of the court , can , they say , write his own name . He is a justice of the peace and won his election to this post by declaring , " I have been sued on every section of the statute and know all about the law , while the man running against me has never been sued for anything whatsoever and knows nothing about the stat-  | ute . " This made sense to the citizens of this town and they elected him . Knowledge is knowledge no matter how you come by it , they figure . Samuel Brady , the sheriff , in buckskins , moccasins , and with a side knife the size of a pigsticker , is a sight to scare wrongdoers without ever hearing the sound of his voice ; a sound they say can be heard as far north as the Lakes and as far south as the falls of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be an awesome sight in his underdrawers without the knife . He is actually no different from the rest of the men here in what he wears , in the size of his side knife or his lack of shoes . Every man , woman , and child here is in moccasins . I have yet to see my first pair of shoes . They look at me as I go clip-clopping along in my brogans as if I was half horse , and had been shod by Oursley himself . I am here , however , to report the trial to you , not to take up your time describing a way of life we outgrew some years ago . But the truth is , I do n't feel much different here on Fall Creek than I would on the banks of the Congo . As Pendleton now is , we once were . But as a grown man forgets the time he crawled and hung to his mother 's skirts , so we in the civilized city of Cincinnati forget how we lived when the town was first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state to outgrow as fast as possible . Judge Giddings invited me to dinner ; it was not an invitation to be turned down lightly . It was n't issued out of any concern for my comfort , but because it is felt to be a duty of visiting lawyers and the like  --  if there is a like  --  to provide some entertainment for a populace starved for something lighter than murder , Indian abduction , ague , and death by snakebite . Play party or not , trials here are attended by as many as three hundred people . Lately , I am told , a lawyer from out of state asked permission of the presiding judge in a polite but somewhat lengthy way to " plead his case . " " Plead , plead , " the judge ordered him testily . " For what other reason do you think three hundred people have gathered here except to hear you lawyers orate ? Get on with it . " The rebuked lawyer did , for three hours , and the woodsies listened to him spiel the way we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glad to find that I was n't going to have to carry the burden of entertaining Judge Giddings alone . Also present for dinner were Jonathan Armitage , the circuit prosecutor , and a friend of his , Dan McGowan , brother of the presiding judge . Giddings , after Armitage 79  | had declined , asked the blessing . A very large nicely browned goose was then placed on the table ; it was well stuffed , as we discovered , with a dressing of tasty bread and onions . Dan McGowan , after his first bite , said by way of compliment , " Judge , this is a damned fine goose . " Giddings , to my astonishment , replied , " Yes , it is a fine goose and you are fined a dollar for swearing . " It seems that in the town of Pendleton there is a statute imposing a fine of one dollar on any person who should " profanely curse , swear , or damn . " My God , I 'm glad I did n't open my mouth about that goose , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Giddings 's fine , not another word was said during the entire meal . Armitage and his friend McGowan could scarcely swallow for rage . The judge and I chomped away without interruption . When we finally pushed back our chairs , the judge said , " Squire McGowan , pay me a dollar . " I was beginning to get some idea of the kind of man I was going to have to plead my case before . Invite a man to dinner and fine him a dollar for complimenting your goose ! Squire McGowan , from Indianapolis , no mean town itself , to hear him tell it , said , " I have n't a cent with me , Judge . " " Perhaps your friend Armitage will loan it to you , " Giddings said , accepting no excuse . Armitage said , " I have barely enough to pay my tavern bill , Judge . " I had the money but I thought , It is n't my goose that 's being cooked . Let these Hoosier friends and lawyers fight it out among themselves . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Loan him the money , Judge , and take his note . Or bind him over to court , " suggested Armitage . " If I bind him over , will you go his security ? " " The law forbids lawyers going security for anyone , Judge . But you can go security yourself , " Armitage reminded Giddings . " Just draw the recognizance saying Daniel McGowan and Henry Giddings appeared before Henry Giddings , Associate Judge of the Madison Circuit Court , and acknowledged themselves indebted to the state in the penalty of twenty-five dollars each , for the appearance of Daniel McGowan at the next term of court , to answer . " Now I 'll be damned , fine me or not , if this preposterous idea was n't  | accepted . The paper was drawn up and signed . Thus ended my first dinner party in the town of Pendleton . I left thanking Judge Giddings for his goose , which I was careful to call " tasty " ; though in truth , as McGowan had said earlier , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk with my clients , whom I had n't yet seen . This town had had no jail and no courthouse until what they have been calling " the massacre " took place . The citizens here are accustomed to throwing up buildings on short order out of necessity . They arrive , bag and baggage , with no roof over their heads until they raise one . They have learned to get one up fast if not fancy . This jail , though more substantial , is about on the order of what a Buckeye would call a farrowing pen . It is square , built of heavy beech and sugar-tree logs notched down carefully and fitting tight above , below , and on the sides . The place has one door and no window . Until the escape of all the prisoners soon after they were brought over from the settlement , there was no stockade . Now a stockade manned by guards day and night surrounds the prison . The guards are paid by the Indian Bureau and have a daily ration of meal for corn pone and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stockade and through it into the jail room itself . It is , as I said , no better than a shed for animals . No furniture , straw on the floor ; a bucket in a corner for an outhouse . The men themselves , though heavily ironed and in such disagreeable surroundings , were in good spirits . Old Wood , sitting on the floor , was reading his Bible . Young Wood was reading a novel , obtained God knows where . The guards let them crack the door enough to get a sliver of light for reading . No one , ironed as these men were , was going anyplace if the door was wide open . But the nonreaders objected to an opening wide enough to let the wind whistle in . I introduced myself as one of the lawyers come to defend them . They were not at all happy to see me . They were not much fazed by being accused of murder . Mad , yes , that their neighbors , gone chickenhearted about the possibility of Indian revenge , had helped round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fazed . They were more taken aback because the very Indian Bureau they all hated took these charges seriously enough to provide them with defenders like myself . Anybody can be accused of anything . But to have the Indian Bureau take these accusations seriously enough to provide defense lawyers galled them inordinately . Benson , clanking like a gristmill , strode about bellowing at me. 81  | " Get me out of here , " he demanded . " What 's this country come to ? Lock a man up for shooting a redskin ? Where would we all be if our fathers and grandfathers had been too thin-skinned to do that ? Bones , is what . Skulls without hair . Or driven back into the sea . There would n't be a white man alive in the U.S.A. today if we had n't fought them red devils . My father and your father was praised for what I done . And now you lock me up . Iron me like a mad bull . " I tried to calm him down , or at least to quiet him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you up . I 'm not disagreeing with a word you say . I 'm here to get you out of here just as soon as possible . There 'll likely have to be a trial . Colonel Johnston and Secretary Calhoun have promised the Indians that if they hold off from attacking the settlers , the men who were responsible for the massacre  --  that 's what they 're calling it  --  will be tried just as if they 'd killed white men . " " If I 'd killed a white man , I 'd expect to be more than tried  --  I 'd expect to be strung up . " " There have been white men killed  --  justifiably . That 's one reason I 'm here . Undoubtedly there was some reason , some reason a jury will understand , for your shooting those Indians . " " The jury will understand why 1 did it . Just one word from you . " " And that word ? " " Indians . And the Indian Bureau did n't need to go all the way to Ohio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Those tribes up north are n't going to swallow setting you free for a reason like that . They 're all Indians , too , and they 're clean against shooting a man because he 's an Indian . Now if there was some act of aggression . . . " " What d' you mean , act of aggression ' ? " " If they shot at you first  --  or made you think they were going to . If they stole your horse . Or made a run at you . Or taunted you . Or threatened you . Did anything like this precipitate the shooting ? " " Hell , no . They were a bunch of squaws and their brats . How could they threaten ? Except breeding the way they do . " " So there was no reason for the shooting ? " Benson , in spite of the load of metal he was wearing , jumped a foot in the air and came down in the straw , raising a cloud of dust . " There was reason . How many times do I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were Indians . They were fishing in our streams ; trapping everything with fur . Killing off the deer . Bleeding the maple trees . Pushing in right next to our homes . Asking our women for handouts . How 'd those Indians up north like it if we started doing  | that ? These are facts . And every man you can set on a jury knows it . The Indian Bureau taxes us , then wastes our money hiring men like you to come up to Madison County and tell us what we already know . " George Benson was about like a boy who 's picked windfalls in his neighbor 's orchard all his life . . . . No , that 's a bad example . He was like a man who 's shot wolves all his life in the belief that he 's protecting himself and his neighbors and who 's suddenly told wolves must be protected  --  young and old , male and female  --  unless by chance the wolf has got his fangs at your throat . That 's the way he 'd been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his father and grandfather had lived . And nothing Calhoun or Colonel Johnston could say was going to change him . Not overnight , anyway . I decided there was no use wasting more breath at this point on Benson . Wood Sr. was deep in a nest of straw , as comfortable as a setting hen . He was n't shaped anything like a hen , thin and brittle as a cornstalk after the first frost ; but he was the gray and white of an old Plymouth Rock . He closed his Bible on his finger when I approached and said , " Sorry I ca n't ask you to pull up a chair . " He was the opposite of Benson : calm , understanding , and seemingly not too put out to be sitting in a straw nest in a jailhouse . " We 'll spend a week or two here ' til the whole thing blows over . After the burnings up north , I guess our neighbors did n't have much choice . In their shoes I 'd of done the same thing , likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ setting here than for them heathen to sweep down on our women and children . " " There 's going to be a trial , " I told him . " That 's why I 'm here . " " I never been in a trial , but I 've seen more'n one and I 'll know how to handle myself . You 're the one appointed to get us off , ai n't you ? You just let me know what to say and you 'll find me an apt pupil . I ai n't as young as I was , but I 've got all my wits about me still . " The boy reading the novel said something like , " Hrrumph . " " That 's my son , " the old man said . " John Wood , Jr . He thinks I lost my wits marrying again . " " Nothing wrong with marrying . It 's who you marry , " said the son . " Reba 's my problem , not yours . " " Well , there 's one thing she ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a fact , and she knows it . Benson here says he could n't have done better himself at the camp . And he told her so . " I was n't interested in the home affairs of the Wood family .  | " I heard down at the tavern that others besides you three ought to be here , " I told Wood . " Clasby , you mean ? He 's clear to Texas by now , " said Wood . " Was he the leader in this ? " " What d' you mean , leader ' ? " Benson , who had clanked over , asked . " Did he put you up to it ? " " What do you mean , put us up to it ' ? We been fighting Indians all of our lives . We would n't be alive today if we had n't . We 're grown men , Counselor , we do n't need anybody to put us up to anything . " Benson gave me strong thoughts about applying for a job with the prosecutor . If I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sight of Benson twitching at the end of a rope would n't give me too much pain . I ignored Benson . " Mr. Wood , I heard down at the tavern that besides Clasby there was another man at the shooting . Is that right ? " Wood Sr. did n't get a chance to answer . " If anybody else was there , let Calhoun and Johnston ferret them out , " Benson said . " You got three of us here chained up like wild animals . Ai n't that enough to satisfy the redskins and their guardian angels , the Indian Bureau ? " " I am hired by the Indian Bureau to defend you . I did n't ferret you out or chain you . " " I ai n't done anything to be defended for . " " There was one other there , " old Mr. Wood said . " A boy . And he did n't have a gun or take any part in it . " " He sure as hell did n't . For all the help he gave us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Benson declared . " Who was this boy ? " " Ben Cape . The preacher 's son , " Benson replied . " Nothing but a soft pile of guts . Never saw a preacher 's son who was n't either a hellion or a soft pile of guts . Do n't know why , but a preacher 's son ... " Wood Jr . said , " Shh , " and Benson , who would n't bat an eye at old split-foot himself , said , " Well , speak of the devil ! " Not the most courteous way to address your pastor , but Cale Cape , as Benson called him , had lived too long among these rough Indian killers to take offense . " Well , George , " said he , " your body may be in chains but your spirit , I see , is still free and soaring . " Caleb Cape had left Piqua before I passed through there , but I  | had heard about his ride to bring the news of the killings to Colonel Johnston . He must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? but there were more people to think about at the settlement than the killers . And in case of a raid from the north , none of the braves from up there was going to inquire as to who had done the bloody work at the sugar camp in order to spare them . If anything , Benson and the two Woods would be spared for special attention after the quick work was over . So they did n't have any reason to be mad at Cape . Besides , the Indian Black Antler had been the one to get the news to Colonel Johnston while Cape was laid up someplace with the grippe . Cape does n't look much like our Ohio preachers , plumped up on chicken and dumplings and with a paunch to put a pretty curve on a watch chain . Cape is a tall , lean man . I can see some Godsearching in his eyes , but there 's a sardonic turn to his mouth that looks more like punning than praying to me . Be that as it may , he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members of my church . This is the Sabbath and they 've been denied religious service . I 've come over to read the Gospel and pray with them . You 're welcome to stay if you 've missed divine worship today yourself . Welcome , in any case . " I thanked him and said he 'd likely prefer to be alone with his parishioners . What he preferred , I did n't care , but if I 'd sized up Benson right , I 'd prefer to be absent when he started praying and testifying . " My daughter 's waiting outside . The guards did n't think the jail a place for a young girl . You might keep her company for a while . " He was right . The jail was n't any place for her . Cape 's daughter was the girl I had caught sight of earlier , the fox-fire girl . The place for her was out in the open , with plenty of cooling air for all . I said who I was and she said who she was . " Hannah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flares up like a pine-knot torch on a dark night . Hannah Cape ! Some slipshod backwoods slattern , from the name ; and here she was fresh from Parnassus , neither backwoods nor frontwoods , but from that peak where gods and goddesses live . I just stared , and she was n't abashed by staring . No stubbing her toe or chewing her sunbonnet strings . She stared back . Girl , I thought , you 're hungry for kisses , and I 'm the man who can supply you . Pa , it has perhaps become apparent to you that you 're not going to be able to print everything I write you . It has certainly become apparent to me that I ca n't write only what I think subscribers to the Western Spy crave in the way of reading matter .

You do n't have to worry on that score . No hearsay except when I label it so . No making the prosecution out to be blackguards and the defense angels of mercy . No failure to give the Indians their due . Also , I 'll try , insofar as my poor pen is able , to give you a picture of this bleak ( at this time of the year ) , outlandish , still tree-covered backwoods . So with that warning : this girl , Hannah Cape . A lot of these backwoods girls are so bashful they throw their aprons over their faces when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She stood there ready to give me as good as she got . If I wanted to stare , she would stare back . It was a raw March day , darker and gloomier down here because of the woods .

I know red hair , because so many ne'er-do-well drunken Irish are redheaded , is n't well thought of in Cincinnati . Well , see it here in the gloom and on the head of a milky-white six-foot girl with eyes put in with a sooty thumb , as they say . Hannah 's hair is as bright as a sugar maple after it 's turned in the fall . I do n't know how long the staring match went on . There was n't a winner . I know that . No one gave up . The lawyer was n't the first to find his tongue , either . I know that . Hannah said , " Which side are you on ? " The correct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the side of justice . " And I am .

" " He your sweetheart ? "  | " He never kissed me or anything like that . He was just trying to be a man at the sugar camp . " " That was a poor way . " " His stepmother hounded him .

" " Come to court and tell what you know or go to jail for refusing . " " There 's something he 's ashamed of . " " Everybody has something . Have n't you ? " I should n't have asked that . She dropped her head . " I have , anyway . Most of us have . We 're safe , though . We wo n't be subpoenaed . " I took her hand . I did n't want her to be ashamed of anything . She did n't jerk her hand away but let me fold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have been next in order if her father had n't come back at that minute . " We 're going to have a singing service now and we need your voice , Hannah . The guards say you can come in for that . Mr. Fort , wo n't you join us ? " My singing , as you know , sounds about like a strangled bullfrog 's ; and my inclination at that moment was to put my best foot forward before Hannah . So I said I had other business  --  which was to get over here , write this , and think about Hannah . End of extracts from a letter by Charles Fort to Enoch Leverett. 87  | Lizzie Cape , having cleaned up after the turmoil of Sabbath worship and eating , sat in front of the fire with her tired feet on a footstool . The service for worship had n't been very worshipful . If God had listened to that morning 's praying , His head must be spinning . He had been asked to release the imprisoned ; to restrain the Indian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up north ; to send Clasby back to make a full confession that the guilt was his alone ; to bless Colonel Johnston in his efforts to appease the heathen ; to protect them from attack ; to have Colonel Johnston scalped ; and the praying was divided about half and half to have Caleb Cape himself either blessed or shut up , once and for all . A trial for killing an Indian was an unheard-of thing , even if this was just a mock trial to settle down the northern tribes . But , mock or not , George Benson was down there in jail , while Sarah Benson was left alone with her six children . That was n't play-acting for her . Reba Wood probably could make out as well without her two men as with them . But that did n't make living in a straw-floored prison pen any easier for an old man like Wood Sr. Junior likely had a book and did n't know where he was . But apart from discomfort for the men and Sarah Benson 's real misery , separated fribm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of face . How could white men ever hold up their heads again , after being clapped into jail for killing an Indian ? Instead of quieting the Indians down , would n't this embolden them ? Lizzie did n't know . She had n't Caleb 's faith . Or his high spirits , which , made him feel , she believed , that even if God did n't help him he would be able to make out on his own . He and Hannah were over there praying and singing with the men in the Pendleton jail now . Caleb was a true Christian . He could do that after being berated by his own churchgoers this morning for making the ride to Piqua to tell Johnston what had happened . Ben was out of his doldrums enough to do the evening chores . Lizzie was glad that she knew where everyone was , all passably well  | and content . She was glad to be alone in the house . The jailed come to no worse pass than sitting on straw ; Caleb and Hannah praying and singing ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the Indians at least biding their time . The dead Indians quiet in their graves far from Fall Creek , where they had died . Caleb had made her a rocker , much less smooth than the walnut chair she had left behind in York state . This one had as much bump as rock to it . But the movement was soothing ; fire purring ; March wind with now and then a spring whisper ; food enough left from the midday feasting for supper . In the letdown after the day 's work and the past weeks ' worry , she dozed off , a light doze so that she knew where she was , but near enough sleep so that the fire and the faint squeak of her rocker seemed a part of her dream . She dreamed she heard a voice calling " Lizzie , Lizzie . " This did not awaken her , but her own voice answering " Who is it ? " did . " It 's Lute , Lizzie . Luther Bemis . I hope I did n't scare you . Ben @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was only dozing . Come in and shut the door . Warm your-self , " she said . Bemis was rubbing his hands , and he had his jacket collar turned up like a man bone-cold . " The wind 's raw . " " I reckon you 're not still suffering from your sickness . " " The only sickness I had , Lizzie , was heartsickness . " " We all get that at times , Lute . I 've been laid low with it more than once . " " Not like mine . " " I did n't say that . " Bemis pulled his bench right up to the edge of the ashes and used the fire 's warmth like water to lave his hands , turning them over and over like a hired man at the washbasin after the dinner bell 's rung . She and Lute were at home with each other . It was strange that it should be so . He , a long hunter , a wanderer , had had more than one Indian wife , it was said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as animal . They were about of an age , and she could n't tell herself she felt motherly toward Lute . Or sisterly , either . She felt like a woman in the presence of a pleasing man . Perhaps most women felt that way with Luther Bemis . She was easy in her feeling about him because the bond with Caleb was so strong . Caleb was her husband the way her mother was her mother , a flesh-and-blood tie nothing could change . But just as there were women she could never 89  | imagine being a mother of hers , so there were men she could never imagine as a husband . Lute was n't one of these . They were one flesh the way the Bible said . Nothing she felt about Lute would change or would need to be hidden if Caleb came in . Caleb had converted Luther Bemis , made a Christian out of a hard-drinking , loose-living wanderer ; seen him settled and married , felling trees and planting corn ; expecting now a young one born of a Christian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but she was Caleb 's right hand in his work  --  he himself said so  --  and in this way they were both Luther Bemis 's spiritual parents . " I came looking for Cale . He around someplace ? " " I hope so . But he 's not around here . He and Hannah rode over to Pendleton to see the men in jail there . " " They 're still holding them ? " " There 's going to be a trial . You surely know that . " " I thought they might 've come to their senses . " " They ? " " The government . " " It makes sense to the government to try the men who did the killing , if that 'll stave off an Indian uprising . Do n't it to you ? " " They 're our own folks , Lizzie . " " The ones the Indians 'd scalp would be our own folks . Us , maybe . " " Sometime last week the world went round a bend , Lizzie . What was is past and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far ahead to see . " " Went round a bend ? What happened last week ? " " Lizzie , women are the most matter-of-fact beings in creation . Nothing happened last week except that we suddenly caught sight of what 's around a corner we 'd never turned before . " " What was that sight ? " " A world where an Indian is a human being who ca n't be killed like a bear or a wolf . " " What 's that mean for us ? " " I do n't know . There 's darkness ahead . " It was full dark when Lizzie heard the horses come into the yard . Ben went out to unsaddle and feed . Both Caleb and Hannah were wet with the drizzle that had started up after Bemis left . Lizzie could feel the tiredness in Caleb as she helped him out of his coat . Hannah was as lit up as if she 'd made the whole trip on wings under angel-kindled starlight . She was even less wet than Caleb . Lizzie let Hannah take care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire  | for Caleb and brought him a cup of hot sassafras tea and a slice of sweet cake . She did n't intend to lay the burden of Luther Bemis 's need on his shoulders until he was , if not rested , at least dry and fed . " How are they ? " she asked . She did n't need to say who . " They 're dry , " Caleb said . " That 's more than I can say for myself . " " How 're they taking it ? " " The Woods might as well be there as any place . Both reading . Benson may tear the place down . " " Ai n't he ironed ? " " I 've seen a bull with a ring in his nose bust through a fence even though he lost a part of his nose in the process . Benson 's bull-mad . " " They 're not in any danger , are they ? " " They do n't think they are . " " What do you think ? " " I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Try them . And if guilty , hang them . " " Treat Indians like whites ? " " They ought to , I reckon . At long last . But I would n't stake my life on its happening . Lizzie , could I have a little hot milk with some rum in it ? " " I 'll fix it for you , Papa , " Hannah said . She swooped to put milk in a saucepan , saucepan next the coals , rum in the milk . " The ride do n't seem to have tired Hannah . " " She do n't know she rode . There was a young defense lawyer over there too busy making eyes at her to pay much heed to his clients . " " Better the lawyer than that poor accused boy . " " Nothing 's been proved yet about him . All 's hearsay so far . " " I did n't say guilty . " " Lizzie , you 'd make a fine lawyer . " After Caleb drank his hot milk and rum , Lizzie told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'd be played out . " " I am . But I 'll have to go . Ora needs someone to talk to . " " You know what 's the trouble ? " " I 've got an inkling . " Charlie Fort was always able to start his Ohio letters with real news of the impending and unheard-of trial : whites being tried for killing Indians . His concluding paragraphs were about himself and 91  | Hannah . He tried , in the real-news part of his letters , not to editorialize , to hide his amazement that so much back-country ignorance could exist so near a center of learning like Cincinnati . He did permit a little of his amazement to show . Otherwise his fellow citizens of the Queen City would find his reports unbelievable . Extracts from letter by Charles Fort to Enoch Leverett : The town of Pendleton ( I 've learned finally not to call it a settlement ) had first of all to build itself a jail to hold the only prisoners it has ever impounded . It has now also built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is , I suppose , a courthouse ; but there is nothing to distinguish it from a livery stable or a low-class tavern in our parts . It is a log building with two rooms , one for the court , one for the grand jury . The courtroom is about twenty by thirty feet long with a heavy puncheon floor and a platform about three feet high at one end enclosed by a heavy railing . Inside this railing is a bench for the judges ; a deal table and chair for the clerk , the aforementioned Fenton , who got himself elected justice of the peace by his claim that he knew all about the law , having been " sued on every section of the statute . " In front of the platform is a long bench for counsel . Here I will sit . Near this bench is a little pen for the prisoners I 'll be defending . There is a side bench for witnesses just behind counsel . A long strong pole , substantially supported and attached to the floor , serves as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bar from the crowd that will be attending this trial . Feeling , as I need not say , is running very high here . Half the populace is so fearful of retaliatory vengeance by the tribes , and especially by the always warlike Seneca , that they would , I verily believe , roast every prisoner alive to calm down the Indians and save their own hides . The other half of the populace are friends and relatives of the prisoners and those who believe that trying whites for killing Indians will be taken by the red men as a sign of weakness on our part and will bring down upon us the worst massacres we have yet experienced at their hands . Persons of these convictions would like to free the prisoners , and , though outnumbered , are prepared to fight off any reprisals , shot for shot . But the government is standing firm in its determination to hold this trial . Colonel Johnston will be back with Indian chiefs and Mingos to let the people of Madison County understand what will  | surely happen if there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Johnston has been empowered to fee witnesses and to require their presence at the trial . And the very employment of General James Noble , a United States senator , to prosecute the men accused of the killing will convince the Indians that the Great White Father is on their side . We defense lawyers will have our work cut out for us , as I am fully aware . There are some few , a handful at most , who regard this trial in the light of any other trial , and disregard color . Men have killed men . Let the law of the land , if guilt is proved , prevail . Caleb Cape is no doubt one of these . Black Antler , the Seneca Indian prophet , goes even further . But I do n't expect him to have a hearing . He does n't want any executions . At the time of my first visit to my clients , recounted earlier , I met Caleb Cape , the preacher at the settlement where the prisoners live . Cape is not a preacher by virtue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of any particular denomination . He is a preacher by virtue of the fact that he preaches . He does preach with power , and the settlement could n't hold him in higher regard if he had arrived anointed by archbishops , wearing robes , and bearing certificates and seals . At the time I met Cape ( since he is n't ordained I wo n't call him Reverend ) , I also met his daughter , Hannah ; and I heard from my clients , Benson and the two Woods , that her brother , age fourteen , had been at the sugar camp at the time of the fracas ; though all said he had taken no part in it . I met Caleb Cape on Sunday at the jail . Three days later , on Wednesday , I rode over to his place . I did n't expect too much trouble defending my clients ; they were white men protecting themselves against the nuisance , if not the menace , of having Indians move in on them , fish their streams , kill their game , and scare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some threatening word or gesture , my case would be further strengthened . Seeing Hannah again did n't go against my grain , either ; that low voice that could be mistaken for a boy 's if you had n't seen the throat and bosom from whence it rose , that hair strong as sunlight . Though to tell the truth , so overwhelming was my feeling for this girl seen for an hour at the most that I had been blinded to remembrance of her features . I could remember her voice clearly enough . And no one could forget that bonfire of hair she carried . But eyes , lips , nose , brow ? Feeling had covered my eyes like a film . Here I was brooding 93  | about a girl I was n't sure I 'd recognize in a crowd if she had her hair covered . I was homesick for her . But how can a man be homesick for a land he ca n't remember ? So I wanted to go over and find out what I was homesick for . Perhaps be lucky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I was not much use to myself or to my case with my heart in a knot of ignorance and aching for knowledge . In any case , Hannah or no Hannah , it was my duty to see and talk to Ben Cape , so I had no trouble persuading myself to saddle Bay Boy at sunup Wednesday morning . My little pacer , eager as I was to cover ground , stepped off the near to twenty miles in something less than three hours . It is now full spring . Not that this far north there wo n't be sleet , snow , and even a blizzard or two before May Day blooms . And even in May there is always the chance of a blackberry winter , white snowflakes bigger than the white blossoms of the vines they settle on . But April was just around the corner . I smelled it all the way riding to Hannah ; smelled the dogwood , redbud , and elder blossoms in the season ahead of me . All came floating rich and fragrant on a tide of warm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's snow . In this back country , anyone who steps out of his house is visible ? unless he 's gone behind a tree to dodge arrows or to relieve himself . There are no hedges , fences , not even a little low picket fence ; no rows of trees , no lilac or snowball bushes . There 's not even the clutter of rigs and farm implements that sometimes fills our farmyards at home . If you were of a mind to keep track of it , you could cast up an account of the number of trips made by a family to the outhouse each day . This would mean keeping an eye on the women ( men here in the back country think privies sissified , and take to the bushes themselves ) . Keeping an eye on women on such errands would n't set well with them or their menfolks , and I do n't intend to attempt it . The point is , except for the trees , it 's a wide-open country , and what is n't done inside four walls or behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are good for . These woodsies have houses or cabins , but these cabins are not suited for a lot of the work that has to be done . You ca n't butcher inside , or tan a hide , or boil down maple sap , or pluck a goose , or smoke a ham , or make soap inside where you 're sleeping and eating . I mention soap because that was what I saw Hannah making that spring day on Wednesday . The winter 's ashes had been leached out , and she was mixing the lye in a big twenty-gallon iron pot with the 94  | grease  --  hog , bear , chicken ( grease is grease ) ? to make soft soap . I 'd as soon try to find a girl Hannah 's age in Cincinnati who could raise a barn as make a bar of usable soap nowadays . Time was when every girl in Cincinnati had the art of soapmaking mastered . Who knows that art now , younger than mothers and grandmothers ? Pause in extracts from letter by Charles Fort to Enoch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't going to send the rest of his letter home for publication in the Western Spy . Not the part he felt he had to write about Hannah , anyway . But he could n't stop talking about her . He was a man of words  --  every lawyer is  --  but at the minute he was less a lawyer than a would-be lover . If I were a poet , he thought , I 'd write a poem . Hannah would be a damned awkward word to work into a poem , and the words men used in poems to describe their loves  --  doves and evening stars and timid violets  --  were far from suiting Hannah . " Hannah , my dove . " What nonsense . He had fallen in love with something more feral . He had no closer friend than the man who had adopted him , and his father would listen if he wanted to write pages praising Hannah . But he was n't presumptuous enough to try to pass off passion as news for the readers of the Western Spy . He had come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ write on it for the pleasure it gave him , as if he were talking to his father . His father would laugh at him , say , " This is a story I seem to have heard from you before , Charlie , but the heroine is new , so spiel on . " Well , she was not only new , she was final , if he could trust his present feelings . He continued to write , though his feeling was of talking . To his father ? Maybe . Maybe to Hannah herself . Continuation of extracts from a letter by Charles Fort to Enoch Leverett : I had ridden twenty miles , more or less , to see this girl , to rid myself of the torment of trying to paint her face each night under my closed eyes . Now the minute I saw her a couple of hundred yards away , my heart gave such a jump I was half of a mind to turn Bay Boy in his tracks and head back for Pendleton . What if all my heartthrobbing had been over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And would I be any better off if I saw under that hair and above that bosom the face that launched the thousand ships ? How was I going to live through that ? Hannah Cape was n't the first girl I had looked 95  | at and clasped . College boys back in Cambridge are judged something of a treat by town girls there . But Hannah Cape compared with those girls was like an eel among flounders . And eel or flounder , I had my work cut out for me in Pendleton . I had n't been chosen for nothing by Johnston and Calhoun . And choice apart , for my own future and for the sake of those poor fellows set up as sacrificial scapegoats , I intended a defense that would n't soon be forgotten . I intended to remind that jury of every Indian raid and torture from 1700 to 1824 , omitting not one faggot of the burnings or knife of the slicings . Potato face would be the best for me . But she looked up at me from over her soft-soap mixture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Presbyterian upbringing and sense of duty to my clients prevented me from pulling her up onto Bay Boy and riding off with her . I think she would have gone without undue fuss . She had the launching face . She also had some boyish straightforwardness that made me jump down and greet her like a teammate , handshake and all . At this point I do n't know whether what I wanted most was to bed her or wrestle her for a fall . So I talked . It 's our great human protection and cover-up . Nice mess of soap , if I ever saw one , said I. Fine open weather for this early in the year . Sorry for the uproar the trial is bringing to your folks . Was her brother home ? I knew he was . I 'd seen him cut for the house as I came into the clearing . She could n't lie . " He 's at home . " " I 've come over to talk to him . " She told me truths and I told her half-truths . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Sooner or later he 'll have to . " " How will he have to ? " " The court has the power to bring witnesses into court and to make them answer questions . " " Any questions ? " " Any pertaining to the case being tried . " " What if they wo n't ? " " They 'll go to jail ' til they change their minds . " " How can they send a boy to jail for not talking ? " " If the court orders a witness to talk and he wo n't , he shows contempt for the court . That 's punishable under the law . " " How do you know Ben was a witness ? " " My clients say so . " " Benson and the Wood men ? " 96  | " Yes . " " Ben will never talk . " " Nobody accuses him of having a hand in what happened . " " Why do you want him to talk ? Do you think he can tell you something that will make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I hoped he might . " " He ca n't . I know all he knows . You 're better off never to say a word to him . " " How do you know all he knows ? You were n't there , were you ? " " Of course not . But he 's told me . " " You could tell me . Just the parts you think he would n't mind my hearing . " " I wo n't tell you anything . I do n't even like to stand here where he can see us talking about him . " " Let 's walk down to the branch . Can you leave your soap ? " " You do n't know anything about soapmaking , do you ? " " I use a lot . " She did n't laugh . But she did start to walk downhill toward the branch that circles the knoll the Cape house is built on . We walked in step , not touching . Arm in arm with some girls , you ca n't keep step . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are to match mince , prance , and lurch , there 's no match possible . You 're as mismatched as a pacer hitched to a trotter . Hannah and I advanced step for step , right foot with right foot , left with left , not touching , except hip or shoulder occasionally , lightly , as if we were n't both big-boned and well fleshed , but some species of winged insect . When we got to the branch we naturally stopped . Wading was n't on the program . Soap was a finished subject . She refused to get started on brother Ben . What country people call frog spit was shimmering along on the surface of the branch , green as emeralds in the clear noon light . It was dazzling . I 've never seen an emerald , but the glitter was like jewels . There was nothing to say . I did n't ask . She did n't offer . When we kissed we were up off the ground for a while . I was , anyway . We rose to that meeting like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charles Fort to Enoch Leverett . Remembering the kiss , Charlie stopped writing and for some minutes lived again in that feeling , relived it and floated once again in 97  | that sustaining air . Then he shook himself , poured water into the bowl , doused his head , and splashed his face . Wake up , Charlie , he told himself . Wake up . Come to . Kissing 's not the job you came to Pendleton to do . Defend the accused . Send Pa the news . Try to keep your hands off the preacher 's daughter . That 's the line of action for you to take . He looked back over what he had written . What Ben had said was news  --  up to the point where Hannah confided in him that she knew all the boy knew . That was between him and Hannah and no business of readers of the Western Spy . He dried his face and hands and sat down to rewrite his report . Ora Bemis arrived at the Cape house soon after Charlie left on his return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , downcast , bigger each day with child . Afternoon had passed and evening had not yet arrived . It was the nameless part of the day ; dayshine past and sundown colors not yet arrived . The Cape cabin door stood open . The house needed all the freshening sunshine it could get after absorbing a winter of wood smoke and the smell of boiling beans and drying moccasins . Ora , at the open door , called , " Lizzie , it 's Ora . " Lizzie , polishing case knives with brick dust , wiped her hands on her apron . " Ora , you think you should be traipsing around the countryside , as far along as you are ? " " My mind 's too uneasy to let me sit still . I came over slow and careful as I could . " " Well , come in and rest now . I 'll make you a cup of tea . " " It 's Cale I came to see . " Lizzie had been a preacher 's wife too long to be surprised at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her husband . She sometimes wondered if their need would be as great if the man of God were a woman of God . Ora was n't one of the women she wondered about . Ora had her own man . " Caleb 's out milking , Ora . He ought to be in any minute now . " " What I 've got to say is private , Lizzie . I 'll go on out to the cowshed now . That 'd be all right , wo n't it ? " " Caleb 'd be glad for company . " Caleb was down to stripping the cow when Ora came into the shed . " Sit down , Ora , " he said , motioning to the last of winter 's mounded hay . " I 've got to finish here . If I do n't take all Daisy 's got , she 'll  | get the idea she can let up on making milk . I ca n't let her get any idea like that . " When tugging and squeezing produced no more , Caleb hung the bucket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Should you have walked over here ? " " I rested a good many times . " " How 's Lute ? " " Like he was when you saw him . Cale , have you told anyone ? What he told you ? " " Not a living soul . " " Not even Lizzie ? " " She 's a living soul . " Ora could n't smile , but her face showed that inside she recognized that a smile would not be out of order . " You think Lute has to go through with it ? " " I still think Lute 's got co do what he thinks right . You know that . He 's a converted man . He 's God 's man . You and me ca n't tell him what to do . " " I can pray , ca n't I ? " " You can pray . But do n't ask God to upset His own laws . " " What law has God got about this ? " " About half the Ten Commandments . Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few not there . Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar 's . ' " " Who 's our Caesar ? Colonel Johnston ? " " And Secretary Calhoun and the federal government . And Governor Ray . " " They ca n't stop me from praying . " " No . But there 're some prayers God ca n't answer . You ask God to strike me and Daisy both dead , and I misdoubt your prayer 'll be answered . " Ora , who had been half crying , began half laughing . " You know I 'm not going to ask God to kill your cow , Cale . " " How about me ? " " You said yourself God would n't do it . What 'd be the use ? " " Ora , why do n't you pray God that Lute does what he thinks is right ? And ask God to give you the strength to stand by him ? " " Lute 's going to do it anyway , ai n't he , Cale ? " " I hope so . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " He 'd feel better doing it on his own ? " " Do n't you think so ? " 99  | " Yes . Pray for me , Cale . " Caleb got down on his knees at Ora 's feet . He did n't know a thing he could ask the Lord but to strengthen Lute in his resolve to do right , and to comfort Ora in what likely lay ahead . He ended his prayer , " Bless this babe-to-be , here in the straw , as Thou blessed another Babe born in the straw . All this we ask in the name of the Father , the Son , and the Holy Ghost . " Before he could pronounce " Amen , " Ora was out of the straw , imploring , " Do n't make a prayer like that for my baby . I do n't want my baby killed . Like that other One . " " He brought blessings , did n't He ? " " I do n't want any blessings that come from killing . " " Jesus did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't like that , either . Why do men put killing and dying and blessing so close together ? " " What would you have , Ora ? " " No killing , no killing . Then blessings would n't matter . We would n't feel the need . " " We need God 's blessing . " " No , we do n't . All we need is to love each other . Cale Cape , you got Lute into this . He was a happy man until you got him saved and started him to worrying about his soul and what was right and what was wrong . " " He 's a better man now . " " I do n't care about better . I care about happy . Why did you have to go and save him ? " " I did n't save him . God did . " " Will God take care of him now ? " " Yes . " " You mean , take him to Heaven when he dies ? " " I hope so . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slippery hay . " Will He take care of him now ? " " The hairs of our head are numbered in His sight . " Ora , who had been standing straight as a pike stick , a foot lower than Caleb , but staring him straight in the eye , wilted . " You do n't know and you wo n't say . Stay away from my husband , Cale Cape . I will pray that Lute forgets he ever laid eyes on you . " Ora ran out of the shed , and Caleb did n't try to- stop her . She was of a mind to tussle if anyone laid a hand on her , and Caleb knew it . Jacob had wrestled with an angel , but Caleb was no angel 100  | and Jacob was n't in a family way . He stepped out of the shed and watched Ora until she had safely crossed the branch . The day of sweet warmth was ending in a red glare . The water had a blood sheen . Tomorrow would be even warmer . He went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the matter , Caleb ? " He was heartsick and could n't use his best remedy for that disease : tell Lizzie all about it . " Could n't you help Ora any ? " " No . She would n't have anything to do with the only kind of help I had to offer . " " She 's backslid ? " " I told her I would n't talk to anyone about her trouble . " " I put the kettle on for tea for Ora . I 'll make you a cup . " While he was drinking , Hannah came in with the bucket of milk . She was rosy and glowing , a strapping milkmaid , if ever he saw one . " Pa , you 're getting forgetful . Milk the cow and leave the milk outside . " " Thank you , Hannah . The forgetful old man thanks you . " He thanked God he did n't have a notionate flyaway girl like Ora Bemis. 101  | Next Sunday morning , Caleb and Lizzie were still in bed , though planning every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours before sunup , but by the feel of the air that seeped into the room , down the chimney and through the chinks , they knew the day would be balmy for April . " Praise God for that , " said Lizzie . Her head was on Caleb 's shoulder , the last rest and comfort she would have that day  --  and the way things were going , perhaps forever . The fit of man and woman always surprised her . It was a detail you might have thought God would n't have had the time or foresight to arrange . The heavy bone of a man 's big shoulder left a hollow before it reached the bulge of the muscle in his upper arm that just fitted a woman 's head . Her hair was as springy as a down pillow there , though not really necessary . The socket of fleshed shoulder and big muscle , soft when not in use , formed a bowl just skull-sized . My skull , Lizzie thought comfortably . " When was the last time we had a real Sunday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could look forward to the peace and fellowship of a church service to follow ? " Caleb asked . " Before the killings , " Lizzie said , then wished she had n't used those words . Now they 'd have to face the day that was ahead of them . " Church has about lost its meaning here . " " We could have a regular service before they arrive . Just the two of us . " " It 'll have to be right here and now , then , otherwise they 'll start riding in before you 've put a comb to your hair . " " What about you ? " " I 'm a short horse and soon curried . " " You 'll have to shave today . " " I will for a fact . Ca n't be outshined by the redskins . " " The meeting 's not set ' til eleven . " " The time set ai n't going to carry a pennyworth of weight with folks who want to see this day 's meeting . There 'll be people here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my guess . They 're fording  | cricks and trying to follow traces from as far away as Indianapolis this very minute . " " Indians and whites have sat down together before . " " Not for any powwow like this . Indians being told white men 'll be hung if found guilty of killing them . " " They been told a lot of things before this that never turned out . " " Not by Johnston . " " Why is Johnston having the people here at all ? Why do n't he take them straight to Pendleton ? " " Here 's where it happened , Lizzie . Here 's the sore spot  --  and the hotheads . If anybody 's liable to fly off the handle about the killings up north , or the trial in Pendleton , it 's the people here . Johnston will go on to Pendleton with his Indians . But here 's where oil has got to be poured on the water . And if I do n't miss my guess , the Indians Johnston will bring in here will make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " What kind of a man is the colonel ? " " He 's nothing special to look at . Not at first glance . Second glance tells you here 's a man that do n't back up . He 's hewn out of the old rock . You could pull every toenail out of him and he would n't change expression . The Indians know this . They do n't fool with him . They ai n't got no cause to . So far . He 's worked for them . " " Is he a good man ? " " In the sight of God I reckon he is . In the sight of most whites he 's a traitor . " " Could n't a fight break out here today ? So many men hating the Indians . " " It 'll be a fist fight if it does . Nobody 's bringing a knife or a gun beyond the lane into our place . Johnston 's seen to that . " " Can he just give orders ? " " He can . And he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see his orders are carried out . " " Right now ? " " They slept the night there . " " You did n't tell me . " " No use your getting worked up . " " They 're going to protect us . Ai n't they , Caleb ? " " Yes . But if I 'd told you , you might have got to thinking who they 're going to protect us from . " A cock crowed , one of their own , likely . They were too far from 103  | the Bemises ' to hear crowing unless the wind was carrying from that direction . " Did someone turn in our place ? " Lizzie asked . " Like as not . But you listen to me , Lizzie . Do n't start asking people in . The house wo n't hold them , in the first place . In the second place , once they got in , you 'd feel you had to feed them  --  and there ai n't enough supplies in the settlement to feed the crowd 'll be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't want to come inside . They ai n't used to chairs , and much as they trust Johnston , they do n't trust us . They 'd think what we had in mind was to get them inside and set the place on fire  --  the way we did at . . . " Lizzie stopped him before he could finish his sentence . " We ? There 's not a person here would think of doing a thing like that . " " Whites thought of it once . That 's what Indians remember . " " Well , I do n't want any Indians in my house anyway . A lot of them are light-fingered . " " You 've never seen any Indians like the ones you 'll see today . There 's nothing in our house they ai n't got better . Look what Clasby tried to steal from them . You only know those poor town reds down around Pendleton  --  drunks and beggars , and thieves if you give them a chance . They were n't that way ' til we came along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touched yet . Chiefs and braves in furs and skins and war bonnets ' til we 'll all stand chopfallen before them in our calicoes and linsey-woolsies . " " We 're all equal in the sight of God , " Lizzie said . Caleb laughed ' til the bed shook . " God save me from arguing with women . Men ai n't women 's equal when it comes to that . " Lizzie was offended . " I was n't arguing . I was repeating what I 've heard you say a million times . " " I said it the other end to . " " Listen . There 's more horses , " Lizzie said . " If there 's going to be any church here today , it 'll have to be here and now , " Caleb told her . " I ca n't pray in bed , " Lizzie said . " I can . That 's where I said most of my prayers when I was a youngun . " " Well , I ai n't a youngun any more . Could you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demonstrated . " Hush up , Caleb . You 'll bring the children downstairs . "  | " Nothing wrong with singing hymns on Sunday . And the better the place , the better the deed , I always heard . " When Caleb was in a bantering mood there were only two things to do : ignore him or give him his head . Lizzie ignored him . She knelt by her side of the bed , her face deep in the covers . Caleb joined her . Not touching her . He 'd told her long ago never to lay a hand on him when he was praying . " God 's got His hand out to me . I know that . But I 'm an earth-bound man by nature and the bond could be broken very easy . " The creak of wheels up at the end of their lane disturbed them both . They lifted their heads , then rose . Ben , who had tried to hide himself from himself , felt at home with the crowd of strangers who filled the yard . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been at the sugar camp at the time of the killing ; to them he could be an onlooker from far down in White River country , or perhaps a Buckeye up from Ohio , or a Keystone state man from distant Pennsylvania . He did n't look a whit different from these strangers , and no one paid him the least heed , not even Hannah , who usually kept an eye on him . She was a hen and he was her only chick ; that 's what he 'd heard said . That time was now long past . Hannah did n't know he lived or breathed today . She was so busy talking to one of the trial lawyers , she would n't have noticed if he 'd dropped dead in his tracks . He was accustomed to having her answer the questions that left him dumb-struck . No one was asking him questions today . He watched his father and mother ; they were shaking hands and talking , no different from the way he 'd seen them at a protracted meeting . He knew the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a better place to watch than most : the angle where barnyard fence met the barn . He had a wall to lean against , a squared-off rail to sit on , and a good round sapling to brace his feet against . In case of any trouble , he could be up and into the barn at the first click of a trigger  --  or war whoop . No Indians had arrived yet , but a space was kept clear for them . That 's what the people were here for : to hear the Indians say they 'd be willing to let the white men take the punishment of the white killers into their own hands . If the Indians did n't believe white men were going to do that , they 'd swoop down five hundred or a thousand strong . That 's what Johnston , the Indian agent , said . And that would 105  | be the end of the Fall Creek settlement , of the town of Pendleton , and of every human being living between . Ben was so interested in the crowd , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top rail . Squirming around to find out who had crowded in , he saw a man who , except for his clothes , looked like a blacksmith  --  big , dark , and somehow sooty-looking because of the stub ends of the dark beard under his skin . His hands were as big as a blacksmith 's , but Ben could see on second glance they had never handled horseshoes or hammers . His shoulders were up on a level with Ben 's , and his butt , though big , was firm . It did n't give an inch when Ben shoved into it to keep from being pushed through the barn wall . " You feeling pinched ? " the man asked , kindly . Ben was , but hesitated to say so . Some soft fiber in him ( he was ashamed of it as being unmanly ) made him hesitate to tell people that they were in the wrong . They would be ashamed to learn it , he thought . He was ashamed when he was in the wrong , and he had had too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't made up of duplicates of Ben Cape . " I 'm O. A. Dilk , " the man next him said . " I shoved in here on purpose . You 're Ben Cape , are n't you ? " Ben did n't see any way of avoiding a yes to that , though he preferred remaining a stranger with other strangers . O. A. Dille did n't make any remarks about the sugar camp . He did say , " I 'm a lawyer for the state . " Ben was n't positive what a lawyer for the state did , but he was pleased that he had been right in guessing the man was n't a blacksmith . " Who 's the beauty over there talking to silver-tongued Charlie Fort ? " Ben did n't see any beauties , but when Dilk pointed , he had to admit , " That 's my sister , Hannah . " Dilk scanned him as if searching for some family resemblance . Ben knew it was n't there . " You 'll likely see plenty of lawyers the next couple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject . Ben kept his mouth shut . " All of them shining up to your sister ? " said Dilk . This was a new idea to Ben . He was n't in the dark about Hannah 's feeling for Johnny Wood , but Johnny , as far as he could tell , would choose a book any day over Hannah . Maybe lawyers were more hotblooded than other people .  | " You know all the people here , Ben ? " Dilk asked . " I know our neighbors . " " You know the families of the prisoners ? " " I seen Mrs. Wood here . " " Point her out to me . " Ben pointed . " I thought she 'd be older . " " She is old , " Ben said , for whom old age began at about thirty-five . After that everyone was old . He was surprised that O. A. Dilk , a state lawyer , was not very much older than Johnny Wood . He was twice as big , with not a gray hair in his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never have thought the state would choose a lawyer with a dimple in his chin . He would n't . It looked childish . " Mrs. Benson not here ? " Ben pointed . " The one with all the younguns ? " Ben nodded . " I 'd think they 'd all stay home . " " They want to see the Indians . " " Their pa did n't have any love of Indians . " " Who told you ? " " Why do you think he 's in jail ? " " Lots of people get in jail by mistake . " " You 're a smart boy . And lots that ought to be there are passed over by mistake . " Ben looked at O. A. Dilk . If I was in trouble , I 'd like him on my side , not against me , he thought . He kept his mouth shut . " Clasby ought to be in jail , " Dilk said . Ben was silent . " Your sister , Hannah , found Clasby 's saddlebags with stuff he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killing . " " How do you know that ? " " That 's what I 'm here for , to find out facts like that . Then to prosecute the guilty . " " Prosecute ? " " See that they are punished . " " Hung ? " " If guilty . That 's the law . Who 's that big fellow ? " " The one with . . . " Ben was too delicate-minded to say , " The woman who 's going to have a baby . " Dilk said it for him . " Mr. and Mrs. Bemis are their names . " " Poor lady , " said Dilk . " Poor lady . " 107  | Ben knew having a baby was no treat for a woman , but he 'd never heard them pitied before because of it . He was hungry . He had had nothing since breakfast , and his father had told him not to be seen with food until the last person had left the place . " We ca n't feed them all , and there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now you can stay out of the house and if your pangs get so you ca n't stand them , sneak into the barn and have a couple of mouthfuls of chicken food . That 'll keep you going ' til nightfall . " He was thinking about doing that when all the people in the yard turned as if by a single lever to face outward and every one , as if all their throats had become one big throat , half yelled , half whispered , " Here they come . " It was the Indian chiefs who were coming . They moved into the lane where the other visitors had been forbidden to come . " They 're not supposed to ride in , " said Ben . " Other people could n't . " " They can , " Dilk told him . " Johnston arranged with your pa . If you were a dozen Indians would you walk into a crowd of half a hundred whites after some of them had just finished killing your women and children ? " Ben did n't say anything . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't , " Dilk answered for him . Ben kept his mouth shut . He was n't sure what sound would come out if he opened it . Maybe he 'd yell a warning like any boy seeing Indians crouched behind the farm 's snake fence before making a run for the safety of the house . Maybe the sound would be a whoop for joy , the way it was when geese went over in a shifting V half as big as the sky , crying their own messages back and forth . Maybe he 'd turn his face to the barn , hide it in his arms , and cry for Folded Leaf , who 'd never grow up now to ride a horse like this . He made some sound . " You never seen the like , did you ? " He never had . He did n't know the like existed . Fifteen men , not on half-starved Indian nags , but on big arch-necked stud horses , all colors , but all high-stepping , came up the lane . " They do n't look like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Ai n't you here to defend the Indians ? " " I 'm here to prosecute men who kill Indians . " 108  | At the head of the line , which was coming at a walk , giving everyone time to take them in , regalia and mounts , were three white men . " They squaw men ? " Ben asked . Dilk snorted , deep as an old man 's snort , thick and phlegmy . " There 's Indians coming here who have powwowed with the President of the United States himself . You call President Monroe a squaw man ? He 's talked with Indians . " " He never come riding into our place with a bunch of them . " " Back here in the woods you think anybody who says howdy to an Indian is a squaw man . The first horseman in that line is General James Noble , United States senator . You want to call him a squaw man ? " Ben did n't . General Noble was thin and straight as a musket . He rode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no woman 's man , Ben thought , squaw or white . He 'd like to see the woman who 'd yell to the general , " Bring me in an armful of wood while you 're about it . " The general belonged to the general . " Who 's that coming next ? " " Colonel Johnston . " " The agent ? " Dilk nodded . Johnston was as big and heavy as Dilk himself , but colored yellow and white like a miller , instead of dark like a smith . He was burly enough to hoist sacks ; his face sharp and his eyes going everywhere . He would keep tab on whose corn meal was whose , and no arguing about it later . " Connor , owner of the inn at Connorsville , is riding with Johnston . " Connor was , in looks , the soldier of the outfit , more like a general than even Noble . Maybe sitting in the Senate day after day had robbed the general of his fierceness . Connor was the equal of any Indian in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood would flow before anybody scalped him . Maybe that was why the Indians were his friends . Behind the three white men came the Indians , a line of them , who , because of their headdresses , looked as much like birds or beasts as men . Nothing had prepared Ben for the sight , no pictures , nobody 's accounts . " I never seen Indians like them before . " " Not many people have . " 109  | A band of angels would have been less startling . Ben knew how they would look ; like himself , only with wings and long gold hair . This was n't a war party . There was no war paint . But there was enough finery to start a war . If Clasby , who had looted the sugar camp for the few pelts there , could see the skins and furs and feathers and jewelry now riding up the lane , he 'd start a war of his own just to get them . No , it was n't a war party , and the Indians were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why , then , did his scalp tighten up so ? Why were his ears pulled up so high they ached , and why had the back of his neck turned ice-cold ? If he was n't afraid , what was he ? Eagle feathers coming up the lane made into a cap and the cap finished off with a beak and glaring eyes . Hawk feathers held in place with a silver band . Owl feathers shaped like a pinwheel . Earrings , shoulder-long , swinging . Doeskin white as chalk . Tanned skins the color of sassafras bark . Black wolf fur , shiny as chokecherries . Spotted lynx . Snow rabbit . Ermine paws . The nearest he 'd seen to anything like this was a line of maple and beech and hickory trees after the first hard frost had hit them . The nearest he 'd felt to anything like this  --  well , he 'd have to think about that . " They 're not all dressed the same , " he said . Dilk harrumphed again . Ben wished he 'd cough and spit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't all dress alike . Rich Indians have better clothes than poor ones . Young warriors do n't dress like great chiefs . " They 're like women , Ben thought . Not in dresses , like women , but in putting on their best and wearing beads and feathers and bright colors . Not a sound was made except by the horses , the clop of their feet and a stud 's occasional whistling snort . The Indians were still , no movement except as they were moved by their horses ' swing , which they held down to a running walk . The onlookers were as quiet as the oncomers . Once in a while a man in the waiting crowd made a horselike wheezing sound himself , as if words that had come up as far as his teeth had been choked off there . Babies cried , but babies cried no matter what . " Are they all one tribe ? " " They 're a mixture . Mostly Senecas or related to Senecas . It was Senecas got killed . But Senecas have killed so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There 's a Miami there . A Winnebago maybe , though the Senecas tore them to pieces a while back . Oneidas . They 're a part of the Five Nations , along with the  | Senecas . There 's a breed or two there . One of the women killed at the sugar camp was mostly white . " Ben made a sound softer and more broken than that of the horses being reined in . " You choke on something ? " Dilk asked . He had choked on his tears . Better to keep Dilk talking . " Have you lived with Indians ? " " I was brought up in New Jersey . " " How do you know so much about Indians ? " " I 'm here to prosecute men for killing Indians . I 've got to know something about the men they killed . " The line of horsemen was all in the yard in the space that had been kept clear . Ben was able now to see the faces under the feathered headdresses : beaks stronger than eagle beaks and eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had first come to the camp three or four years ago , Ben did n't know any Indians . He was ashamed to look at the Indians in Pendleton ; dirty and drunk , staggering and begging . He would n't want anyone to look at him if he was in their case . He tried to do as he would be done by . In Pendleton , he lowered his eyes . These Indians asked to be looked at . They were Folded Leaf grown tall . They were Black Antler grown rich and a chief of his people . He wanted to say something about these horsemen , these braves bedecked with beads and feathers . " They make us look like a bunch of sick muskrats , " he said . " Nonsense , " said Dilk . " They 're savages . These men you see have eaten dogs . Worse than that , the hearts and livers of their enemies . They 'll keep a man alive for twenty-four hours just so they can roast him longer . They 've run red-hot pokers up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ben would n't let him finish . " If I was an Indian , I would n't have you for my lawyer . " " I 'm not their lawyer . I 'm the state 's lawyer , prosecuting white men for breaking the law . It 's against the law to murder human beings . The law do n't say that if the human being ate dogs or men 's livers , he can be murdered . The law 's got to be respected . I do n't care what the savage did , the law do n't give a man the right to kill him . " " Folded Leaf was n't a savage . He never ate dogs . He never ate anybody 's liver . " Ben was crying . " How do you know ? " " He was my friend . " " Was n't ten pretty young for the best friend of a boy of fourteen ? " 111  | " How do you know how old he was ? " " That 's what I 'm here for . To find out things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was twelve , but little . " " Big enough to swing a tomahawk . Or fire a gun , I reckon . " " He did n't have a gun or a tomahawk . And Black Antler taught him not to kill . " " Who 's Black Antler ? " " His teacher . I studied with Folded Leaf . I learned what he learned . " " How to scalp ? " " No . I learned by heart verses like Bible verses , only Indian . " " All forgotten now ? " " No . I dreamed that the sun in the firmament spoke to me . He told me that the Great Spirit is very angry with Indians for their wicked ways . Tell them they must repent their wicked ways and forsake them or the judgments of the Great Spirit will come upon them . If they do not repent ... " " Who said all this ? " Dilk asked . " This Black Antler ? " " No . Handsome Lake . The brother of Corn Planter . Black Antler taught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was going to do . " " Well , Folded Leaf made a mistake when he fought the whites , did n't he ? " " He did n't fight the whites . Nobody had any chance to fight the whites . You said you came here to find out what happened . Why do n't you ask people who really know ? " " I am , " Dilk said . " I 'm asking you . " Ben took one look at Dilk , saw that he meant what he said , then jumped down from the top rail and pushed his way through the crowd into the barn . He was n't hungry any more but he chomped on corn to ease his feelings . Chomped on corn ' til his gums bled . O. A. Dilk spread out a little more comfortably after Ben 's departure . Any other way of getting at him would have made the boy dry up . He was n't a man who liked to hurt others , but every single thing had to be weighed against every other thing . Better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decide to tell what should be told , than clamp his teeth shut and keep the truth from being known . The Indians and the three white men did n't dismount . There was going to be a palaver , and Johnston intended that he and the chiefs be heard . Down on the ground some shoving might start ; and shoving  | led to blows , and blows to blood , and finally what happened at the sugar camp might seem a frolic compared with this . Dilk was glad to be working with Johnston . The man was an anvil . Hit him and the sparks flew , but he did n't budge . The Fall Creek folks did n't give Johnston credit for it , but what he had done and was doing had saved and was saving them from being wiped out ? houses burned , hair lifted , stock slaughtered or stolen . There were no Indians so proud and vengeful as the Seneca . They believed that the spirits of their slain tribesmen would never rest until those responsible for their killing were themselves slain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Dilk had no idea how Johnston had been able to persuade these masters of revenge and retaliation into letting the white man take care of the punishing . It was possible that to the Indians the nasty business of white men pinioning the arms of other whites , then letting them dangle at the end of a rope , fighting in mid-air for breath , was a revenge sweeter than any they could devise . " They are killing their own . " That would be a sight they might like to see . Johnston was likely the only man whose word they would accept in such matters . He had never lied to them . And if he lied this time , there would be nothing to prevent their carrying out their first plan : burn , scalp , slaughter . Johnston was counting on the settlers to remember this . Dilk was , too . The agent had brought the right men in the right dress and on the right horses . Where he had got the horses , Dilk did n't know . Woods Indians could ride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or in canoes . But they had no such numbers of good mounts as these . Johnston had had no need to outfit them so far as clothes went . An Indian told who he was in two ways that the white did not : by his body , naked or next to it ; and by the display on his body of a rich covering , which told where he had been and what he had done and who in his tribe he was . The very sight of these big men , reared up proud as birds of prey , pennants of animal scuts and feathers flying from their upheld lances , shrunk the settlers down to rail-chopper size . Dilk , a big man seated on the top rail , felt himself dwindle before their display of strength . Johnston , for all that he was riding with a general who had become a senator and Connor , a rich innkeeper , was the best mounted there : a fifteen-hand blood bay with a long black switch tail . He sat in front of the band he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep , tumbling voice , sometimes hard to understand . Johnston appeared to 113  | know this . He spoke slowly , a word at a time . Every person with two ears and a brain between them could hear and understand what he was saying . " White people can read and write . Or most of us can . Because of this we have long records on paper which we can read and reread . And all these records tell us how much we have suffered at the hands of the Indians . " The Indians do n't have any way of keeping track of what they have suffered at our hands , no records that we can read . And if they did have , we probably would n't read them anyway . But I have been keeping records and I can tell you they have suffered . " Many of these happenings you know about already and I do n't intend to keep you standing out here for the time it would take to recount one-tenth of them . What 's just taken place here you all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who were the killers ; or why they killed . A court of law will decide that . The Indians know who the dead are . They know that kin of theirs were killed by men of this neighborhood . They know that the dead were not warriors or horse thieves . Nine people died . Seven of the dead were women and children . They know that . " They know  --  you do , too  --  what happened to some Wyandots over in Hancock County a few years back . A Wyandot chief with his wife was on a hunting expedition . Three white men came to his camp and asked to spend the night . The Wyandots were Christians . They shared their camp with those they supposed to be their Christian brothers . They fed them . They knelt and said their prayers with them . Then they went to bed . As soon as they were asleep , these white men rose up on them with axes , killed them , robbed their camp , and stole their horses . " These murderers and thieves were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while the officials were looking the other way , they broke jail and escaped . And that was all the punishment they ever had : the inconvenience of a few days in prison . " I have told the chiefs with me that this will not happen here . That we will try , then punish , those found guilty of murdering Indians in exactly the same way we try and punish those who murder white men . I have told them that we will not have a mock trial . That there will be no jail breaks after the sentencing . If the accused are found guilty and condemned to hang , they will hang , and the hanging will be public . " Only because they believe me have these chiefs been able to  | keep their young men from descending upon you . It is not Indian nature to suffer in this way without reprisal . Some have become Christians , but turning the other cheek comes less natural to an Indian than to any other people I know . " Two of the chiefs will speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His English name is Sun Fish . Two hundred braves look to him for command . He will speak in his own language ; what he says will be interpreted for you . You should listen well . " Johnston should have been a lawyer , Dilk thought . His witnesses were well chosen . Sun Fish was a young chief , his face full of violence and his eyes aglitter with hatred and pride . He did n't need to say a word to convince those looking up at him astride his roan that , except for Johnston 's promises , he would , with or without the help of his two hundred braves , attempt to avenge the deaths of his kinsmen . His speech was short , clanged out in a rush of brassy sounds . He spoke as a man who scorned words , who had other and better means of defense . He did n't pause between words as Johnston had done , but threw what he had to say at them , in one hard blow . The Indians had minds trained to retain words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what they believed , what their wise men had said , had no place of storage other than their heads . The translator spoke as if the speech were his own . Even his voice had the clang of Sun Fish 's . " There is a treaty between your people and mine . We are not at war . This was not a fight between warriors . There was a time when we called each other brothers . I do not call you brothers today . Brothers do not kill each other 's women and children . We have been promised that the murderers will be punished . We have promised that we will wait and see . We are waiting . " The Seneca wheeled his horse and rode slowly down the lane away from the crowd . He had had his say . Dilk scanned the faces of the listeners . From these men and others like them would come a jury he must convince . What these men had just heard would make his task easier . The departure of Sun Fish had likely not been part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a look . The impression he wanted to make on the settlers was one of Indian unity . " One of the men killed is represented here by his uncle . He is Mingo , son of the great Mingo . " Mingo was a man of forty or more . The grooves from his nose 115  | to his mouth were like runnels in clay land after a hard rain . No Indian was more richly dressed and ornamented than he . Unlike Sun Fish , he spoke slowly and quietly . When he had finished , the translator , also speaking slowly and quietly , said , " I was born by the falls below here . This was all Indian country . There was food for all . No man , red or white , was ever turned away from the red man 's lodge hungry . The land belonged to all . We killed only the animals we needed to eat . Then the white man came . He killed for pleasure and money . The land belonged to whatever man could seize it . The red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , many times . Only this much land and no more . ' Pushed back , pushed back . Driven from our own homes , from our own forests , from our own streams . While taking the sugar sap from our own trees , our women and children are killed . " We had no jails , no judges . We had no thefts . And except in war or in the drunkenness you brought to us , no killing . You have these . " If you do not punish the wrongdoers in your way , we will punish them in ours . The agent says you will do this . If he is right , only the guilty will die . If he is wrong , you must blame yourselves . " Mingo was as self-contained as Sun Fish was tempestuous . When he had finished speaking , he moved his horse quietly back into the group behind Colonel Johnston . The colonel was silent for a time after those speeches  --  letting the words sink in . The words had sunk in . There was no outcry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . " Indians are not great speechmakers . " This , Dilk knew , was less than the truth . When it came to speechmaking old Tom Jefferson himself had to back down . Dilk had read history and the settlers had n't . What Johnston wanted to convey was that the Indians did n't fight with their mouths . They talked with their mouths , more eloquently than most white men could manage . They honored their speechmakers as white men did n't honor theirs . " All wind and no weather " tended to be the white man 's judgment about a talker . The Indian was more all of a piece . A man good with words was n't , in their opinion , handicapped in his use of a tomahawk or arrow . So Johnston wanted the listeners to remember that these talkers were also fighters . " Now we ride to Pendleton to say there what we have said here . The chiefs will then depart for their homes and the trial will begin . "  | The horsemen rode off the Cape place through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Dilk thought he could hear a sound like that of a hive of disturbed bees : a sound of breaths sucked in , of heart thumps , of groans , of belly rumbles . But what could they do ? The agent had asked nothing unreasonable . " You made these laws . Now keep them . " He had the right . But had Indians the right ? To stand up bald-faced and say , " When you kill us , you murder . Hanging is your way with murderers . Keep to your ways . " There was no doubt in Dilk 's mind that many men in Cape 's yard , if they thought they could do it , would mow down all Indians present  --  and their agent first of all . Mow them down and to hell with what came next . But other men were thinking twice ; and some women were crying ; and some , like Indians themselves , had squatted on the dry , sweet April ground and had put their arms on their knees and had buried their heads in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Dilk felt the power rise in him to win it . He saw the Cape boy , his great lank of a redheaded sister , and Fort , the young Ohio defense lawyer , standing together over by the wellhead . Fort was not the chief defense lawyer , any more than he , Dilk , was the chief prosecutor , but they both came to the trial with reputations to defend  --  and to make . He had to see the Cape boy again ; it would be good manners to have a word with Fort ; and Hannah , apart from any trial maneuvers , struck him as being a manifestation of the mysterious ways in which God moved . He had prayed God for guidance when the chance came to take this appointment : lost in the backwoods , trying to persuade white men to do what they had never done before , to have one law for both the white man and the red man . It was not a job he had much stomach for . He needed to stay in the public eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he intended to do . He needed to win cases if he was to get elected . But after praying , he had decided that , in spite of all the drawbacks , it was his duty , even if out of the public eye , and in danger of losing the case , to take his stand for the law which he intended to serve . He had never expected to find as reward here in the backwoods a girl like Hannah Cape . She would grace , she would light up , any marble staircase , Indiana or Washington . The Cape boy had a bloody mouth . " You been in a fight , son ? " Dilk asked . Ben wiped the back of his hand across his mouth , then examined 117  | the stains . " I chewed down too hard on some cracked corn , I reckon . " Dilk had half expected Ben to run on sight , but he stood his ground and answered the question , which was n't really Dilk 's business . Ben did n't know , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fort to Dilk . Dilk introduced himself . " Miss Cape , may I make myself known ? I 'm O. A. Dilk , lawyer for the prosecution . " Hannah said , " I 'm pleased to meet you , Mr. Dilk . " " Oscar , is n't it ? " Fort said , not waiting for further formalities . It was . But Dilk did n't fancy Oscar as the name for a rising young politician . George and Thomas and John were the names of presidents . Where did any Oscars come in ? He tried to hide behind initials . He could n't expect Fort to have any interest in such an undertaking . And he could n't expect , and did n't want , Hannah to be calling him " Mr. Dilk . " She certainly was n't going to be Miss Cape to him any longer than he could help . Fort , who was a smooth-tongued man , he had always heard , began to prove it . " That bunch of Indian dandies did n't help my cause any . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Save white men from being hanged for defending themselves against savages who have been molesting them for a hundred and fifty years . What 's yours ? " " The law . But I 'm sure that Miss Hannah does n't want to have the trial argued here . " " I do n't want to have it argued at all . Now or ever , " Hannah said . " You want to leave it to Indian justice ? " Dilk asked . There was room for brain behind the girl 's white brow  --  and plenty of space for heart , too , lower . " I want it never to have happened . " Dilk smiled . She was a woman . " We live from day to day in what has happened , and in what will happen , if we do n't act . " " Hannah , " said Fort , " we 're going to have the trial argued here and now , like it or not . " Dilk would n't have that , have himself put in the light of being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think about . This was no time to lock horns with Fort . Leave that for the trial , and let it be seen then who was the better man . " Miss Hannah , " he said , " Ben and I had our talk cut short by the speechmaking . If you 'll excuse us , we 'll go on with it . " 118  | Charlie Fort could charm a bird out of a tree . This was n't his fault , but the ability made some people back off from him . The charm , they were convinced , was n't the man himself but something he exuded like birdlime to catch the unwary . Such persons were proud of themselves for escaping . They had scorn for those who did not . The Charlie-resisters attached themselves to some blunt bumblehead , proud of their ability to discern qualities more than skin deep .

In her heart , however , she was a girl in love . And though she called herself " elderly widow , " she knew from the attention paid her by men of thirty that her forty-five years did n't show . Her cheeks were pink , her hair as bronze-gold as it had been at twenty , and , when she had a mind to do it , she could cinch in her waist so that the belts she had worn twenty years ago still spanned her waist . Nevertheless , she tried to bear herself in Charlie 's presence like a good old aunt . This did n't prevent her from providing Charlie with comforts a landlady did n't usually give roomers .

Not that he did n't hit the nail on the head and hit it hard  --  but he used a funny hammer for the job .

Pa was right . The words had n't been invented that would tell one man what another felt about a woman . As to toenails , there was no way he could report this trial without reporting scenes nearly as outlandish . Extracts from a letter by Charles Fort to Enoch Leverett : On the day the trial began , Judge McGowan was unable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the side judges , Omer Oursley , took his place . Oursley is the blacksmith who ironed the prisoners . As a first matter of business Isaac Vickers , defense attorney , rose and made a motion that the out-of-state defense lawyers be recognized . " Judge Oursley , " he said , " I ask that these gentlemen be admitted as attorneys and counselors at this bar . They are regular practitioners but they have not brought their licenses with them . " Judge Oursley said , " Have these men come here to defend the prisoners ? " " They have , " replied Vickers . " Let them be sworn , " Oursley said . " Nobody but a lawyer would defend a murderer . " Mr. Vickers was naturally taken aback at this kind of talk from a judge in a trial , the purpose of which was to decide if anyone had been murdered ; and if so , who the murderers were . He did n't let this deter him , once the attorneys were sworn , from getting on with the business of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said , " for a writ of habeas corpus to bring up the prisoners who are at present illegally confined in jail . " " You demand what ? " Judge Oursley asked . " A writ of habeas corpus . " " For what ? What do you want to do with it ? " " To bring up the prisoners and have them discharged . " " Is there any law for that ? " Oursley asked . Vickers then read the statute regulating the writ of habeas corpus . Judge Oursley , the blacksmith , then said , " That act , Mr. Vickers , has been repealed long ago . " Vickers , an attorney of much experience , was not accustomed to being instructed about writs of habeas corpus by blacksmiths in frontier towns . He kept his temper in hand , but his manner was curt . " Your honor is mistaken about that . It is constitutional writ , as old as Magna Carta , and has never been repealed . " Judge Oursley was not in the least put out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said , " to cut the matter short , it would do you no good at all to bring those prisoners out of jail . I ironed them myself , and you will never get them irons off until they have been tried , habeas corpus or no habeas corpus . Motion overruled . " Soon after this wrangling between Judge Oursley and Mr. Vickers went on , Judge McGowan himself had recovered sufficiently to assume his rightful position between the two side judges . Matters now went more smoothly . Judge McGowan ordered the grand jury to be called . All were present , answered to their names , and were sworn . The grand jury then brought into court an indictment for murder drawn by Mi . Armitage against each of the defendants . Readers of the Spy may be informed , albeit taken aback , by the rough-and-ready methods of this court . Their procedures may differ from those of more settled communities but their goals are the same : justice . This same grand jury , just before the present trial began , was presented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a license . The jurors voted for a bill to be drawn . Armitage , the state 's prosecuting attorney ( then as now ) , drew the bill and presented it to the foreman and asked him to sign it . The foreman refused . " I sell whiskey without a license and always have . I do n't intend to indict others for what I do myself . " " If you do n't sign it , I 'll take you before Judge McGowan . " " What do I care for McGowan ? " asked the foreman . " He do n't know anything about selling whiskey  --  or making it , either . " Armitage is a man I will soon be confronting in the courtroom myself ; and I recount this happening not only as a report on how legal matters are handled in this neck of the woods but also as a reminder to myself of the nature of my honorable opponent . Armitage ordered the grand jury to follow him into court . In the courtroom he said , " Judge McGowan , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a bill of indictment against a man for selling whiskey without a license . " Judge McGowan asked , " Have a majority of the grand jury agreed to find the bill ? " " Yes , your honor . " " Foreman , " asked Judge McGowan , " do you refuse to sign the bill ? " " I do . " " Well , Mr. Prosecutor , " said McGowan , " I see no other way but  | to leave him to his conscience and his God . Take the grand jury back to their room . " Back in the grand jury room the foreman said , " I told you , Armitage , that Judge McGowan knew nothing about whiskey cases . " Armitage answered , " What the judge does n't know about such cases , I do . I will take the necessary legal steps to have the bill signed . " Armitage began to take off his coat . " The law now requires , " he said , " that the last step be taken . " " What step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coat on ? " " No ; with a foreman like you , I ca n't . The last legal step with such a foreman is to thrash him until he signs a bill the majority of the jury has agreed to . " The whiskey-selling foreman had sampled too much of his product for too many years to be in any shape to stand up to Armitage , who is built like a bear and , from all I have seen of him , is about as badtempered . " I 'm not a fighting man , " the foreman said reasonably . " Hand me the bill . I 'll sign it . " When he had signed , Armitage marched the grand jury back into the court . " Has the foreman signed the bill ? " Judge McGowan asked . " He has , " Armitage replied . " I thought his conscience would n't let him rest until he had signed , " the judge said  --  not indicating that he knew the means Armitage had taken to arouse the foreman 's conscience . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But if you do n't understand the informal nature of the courts here in our great sister state , some of the happenings of this trial may seem unbelievable to you . I assure you that everything I report happened ; and happened with just as much verisimilitude as my pen can command . My hands are too full with preparing a defense for these imprisoned men to leave me any time for concocting possibly entertaining but untrue stories . To get back to this trial , the trial jury was chosen and seated without any of the " tying up of jurors " as reported by General Mason in the Springfield paper . The jurors are all hardy , heavy-bearded fellows . Not one wears shoes  --  all wear moccasins , made by themselves or their women at home . And not one is without a side knife thrust in his belt . They are men who know the woods , who have fought their way west in spite of sickness and Indians . The first sight of them 123  | gave me considerable confidence . These are men , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the savages ; men who have managed to bring Christianity and civilization westward with them in spite of constant peril from the red man . The courtroom was crowded on the first day of the trial . Some people came for no other reason than to see " the monkey show , " as they called it . Settlers from up Fall Creek and in Pendleton , whose lives may hang on the decision reached by this jury , were there and gave earnest attention to the trial . Friends and families of the accused men , their faces drawn with anxiety , were there . These were people I had come to know . The families of men I will be defending , clustered together like sheep in a storm . They sat on the front benches with their minister , his wife , and two children with her . Next to the minister sat Luther Bemis and his wife , Ora . There 's more to tell , Pa , much more . I 'm too sleepy to continue now . I 'm not overly satisfied with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I get around to it , to give you an honest report of the proceedings . Enough to say now that the defense received a great shock  --  and setback in the testimony heard by the court today . End of extracts from a letter by Charles Fort to Enoch Leverett. 124  | The courthouse was already crowded when Caleb Cape , with his family and the Luther Bemises , arrived . A bench up front had been saved for them . Jonathan Armitage had seen to that . Hannah , Ben , and Lizzie went in first . Then Ora and Lute . Caleb had the seat on the aisle . The turnout for the trial turned Caleb 's stomach . It always did . Let a churn be stolen or somebody 's coon dog shot , and if the matter came to trial , settlers for twenty miles around traveled to hear the lawyers spiel . It was not to be expected that a trial like this , with generals and United States senators and city lawyers from Ohio pleading , would go unnoticed . Or that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murder for killing Indians , and already ironed and in jail , would not bring out ten times as many onlookers as usual . Caleb supposed that for settlers , lost off in hidden nooks and crannies of the woods , the mere sight of another human being was a treat ? trial or no trial . The arguing of the lawyers was for woodsies what play-acting was for city folks ; except that this was n't play-acting . There was n't any make-believe here . The tears shed would be real tear water flowing from the eyes of real people . The families that would be separated if the prisoners were convicted and given jail terms would be real  --  honest-to-God wives , real flesh-and-blood sons and daughters . Whatever the crowd 's purpose in congregating , the lawyers ' speechmaking would be in itself a seven-day wonder . All those long-tailed words strung together without pause for breath , three hours at a time on occasion ! Why , it was more remarkable than watching dancing bears . Then there were those Indians , splendid as play actors ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at the back of the room . Their slit-stone-agate eyes saw every move that was made . Real playgoers never had to pay any heed to how the rest of the audience was reacting ; never had to wonder if some of the onlookers were whetting their knives or eying nearby heads for handy scalp locks . 125  | Caleb understood all this . Still , he did n't like the flushed , staring faces  --  not much different from faces he 'd seen ogling a two-headed calf . Was anyone there praying ? For the men in jail ? For the Indian dead ? For the jury that would have to search its heart about right and wrong ? For the judge who would have to sentence ? Gawking and gaping , that was about the size and whole of it . He said so to Lizzie , and she whispered , " Shhh , " to him . He whispered again . " Somebody ought to open the windows in here . " Lizzie again whispered , " Shhh . " It was a mild day , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too small for them had raised the room 's temperature to that of humid midsummer . Only , the smell was n't that of midsummer . It was the smell of nervousness and fear , of curiosity and cruelty , with a strong whiff added of winter underwear not shed since last November . He reached over , put a hand on Luther Bemis 's . Lute knew what that meant . Armitage was about to call him to the stand , and Caleb was giving him comfort . Or would give him a shove with a hand , hard and splintery as a roof shake , if he saw any signs of faltering . Lute would n't back down . He had committed himself ahead of time for fear of that very thing . He kept his eyes on Ora . He did n't know for how long he might be separated from her . He was n't sure what she might do now . She had never denied that what he planned to do was right , or that he should be the judge of what was right for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretend ( though she knew pleasing God had to come first with Lute ) that she herself felt at one with God if that meant prison for her husband . What she wanted first of all was for Lute to want to please her . This was wicked but she preferred Lute wicked and with her , to separated and holy as Moses . The cross-grained devil that had lived in Luther Bemis so long was not yet dead enough to permit him to love wholeheartedly any woman who could say , " Forget me and do your duty . " Duty was his job . Loving him was hers . And Ora had always done that job so well , he half expected her to grab his coattails when Armitage called him and cry , " Stay , stay , you fool . " Did he half want her to ? Did he half believe that a God who truly  | loved him would never ask him to go the whole way in this business of confessing his sins ? Armitage was speaking . He only half heard him but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Armitage was asking the court for permission to disregard for the time the indictment brought by the grand jury against John Wood , Sr. He wanted to bring another witness to the stand . Judge McGowan protested . The grand jury must not be by-passed . Armitage argued him down . Why drag out a trial that already promised to run on for days , perhaps weeks , with unnecessary formalities ? " Bring on your witness , " agreed Judge McGowan . " Will Luther Bemis , commonly known as Lute Bemis , please take the stand , " said Armitage . Lute had lived through this scene in his imagination so many times that he moved through the actuality like a man through a dream remembered . Ora did not cling to him . Caleb did not have to shove him forward . He did not feel floor boards beneath his feet . He floated past faces of neighbors and strangers as featureless now as bleached winter cabbages . Only , at the back of the room , the Indians were truly visible and themselves . What he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would try to keep his eye on them as he talked . Fenton , the clerk , asked him to tell the truth , the whole truth , and nothing but the truth . In God 's name , did they think he had got up here to tell them some tall tale ? He glared at Fenton , then remembered that Fenton did not know , as Armitage did , what was to come next . Armitage started him from the beginning . Armitage was the state prosecutor . What Armitage cared about was getting a conviction . Lute knew that . He intended to tell the truth . If that convicted him , and it would , so be it . " Mr. Bemis , where were you on the evening before the day of the alleged killings ? " " I was at home . " " Did you have any visitors that evening ? " " I did . " " Name them . " " Jud Clasby , accompanied by Hannah Cape . " " Why were they there ? " " Jud Clasby was seeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Woods . Our house is between the Wood home and the Capes ' . " " So the call was just a social one ? " 127  | " For Hannah , it was . " " For Clasby ? " " He was sounding me out about the Indians at the sugar camp . " " What do you mean by sounding you out ' ? " " He asked me if I did n't think the Indians at the sugar camp ought to be cleared out . " " What did he mean by cleared out ' ? " " Killed . " " Did he say so in so many words ? " " I do n't remember his exact words . That was his meaning . " " What was your answer ? " " My answer was that I was finished with that sort of thing . " " What do you mean , that sort of thing ' ? " " Killing Indians . " " You had killed Indians before ? " ? why ? ? ? " To save my life . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sometimes because they were Indians . We were pardners , Clasby and me , hunting and trapping out west . It do n't make sense to wait for a dangerous animal to attack you . " " That 's how you considered an Indian ? A dangerous animal ? " " Out west when I was younger  --  yes . Since I came here , I 've been converted . I 've become a Christian . But even the Bible do n't say that if somebody is going to die , you 've got to choose yourself to be the victim . It does say , Do n't kill . ' I told Clasby I was n't going to kill Indians for using a sugar camp and trapping a creek they 'd trapped along for years before we ever showed up here . " " Did anyone hear this conversation ? " " My wife . And Hannah Cape . " " What happened next ? " " Clasby and Hannah left . My wife and I went to bed . " " Did you see Jud Clasby again ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's my intention to answer every question you can think of to ask . It would maybe save time if I 'd tell the court what I did and you ask questions only when you think I 'm leaving out something . " " Proceed along those lines , Mr. Bemis . I 'll stop you when it seems necessary . Now , when did you see Jud Clasby again ? " At this point , the chief defense counsel got to his feet .  | " Judge McGowan , " he said , in a voice accustomed to being harkened to , " may I address a question to the witness ? " Judge McGowan , a man who ruled in his own courtroom , nevertheless harkened . " Address your question , Counselor . " " Luther Bemis , first of all , may I remind you that you are under oath to tell the truth , the whole truth , and nothing but the truth . " " You do n't need to remind me of that , " Bemis answered . " I ai n't forgetting it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm up here for ? " " That 's exactly what I 'm trying to get at . Did you talk over with Mr. Armitage what you have just said ? " " I did . " " And what you plan to testify to later ? " " I did . " " And did Mr. Armitage promise you that if you gave testimony helpful to the prosecution in this case , he would see to it that your sentence was light ? " Luther Bemis 's hand instinctively went to his belt , where ordinarily he carried a knife . " That 's a damn lie , and you know it . " Judge McGowan 's gavel startled Bemis , and the courtroom , which was immediately in an uproar at this exchange , went into silence . " Mr. Bemis , " the Judge said , " may I remind you that you will be held in contempt of court if there is any more profanity . The defense counsel is trying to help you to recognize the fact and try to co-operate with him . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is trying to help me who stands in the way of my telling the truth . " Still belligerent , he glared at his own counsel . Caleb Cape rose . " Judge McGowan , " he called out . Caleb was well enough known to be permitted this interruption of a trial that was proceeding , except for the experience of men like McGowan , by guess and by gosh anyway . " Pastor Cape . " " I am not an ordained minister . " " Mr. Cape . " " I have testimony that might be useful to the court if they care to hear it . " " Step down , Mr. Bemis . Mr. Fenton , call up the witness . " Duly sworn , Caleb said , " Before Luther Bemis ever saw Mr. Armitage , he came to me with the account he now wishes to give to the court . My advice to him was to seek out Mr. Armitage , the state 129  | prosecutor , and to tell him what he had told me . It was Mr. Bemis who sought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No deal for special treatment was made . " " Mr. Cape , " asked McGowan , " why did n't you advise Mr. Bemis to make his report to the defense lawyers ? " " I did n't think the defense lawyers wanted to hear what Luther Bemis had to say . I thought Jonathan Armitage did . It was on my advice Bemis went to Armitage . For the sake of his own soul , I may add . " After this interruption , Judge McGowan ordered the questioning of Bemis by Armitage to continue . " Mr. Bemis , " Armitage asked , " may I now repeat my earlier question ? When did you next see Jud Clasby ? " " After he visited our house with Hannah Cape ? " " That is right . " " Jud Clasby came to our house around nine or ten o'clock the next morning . He said that his horses were missing  --  strayed , stolen , no telling which . Would I come with him and any others he could roust out to look for them ? Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I told my wife good-bye and set out with Clasby . Told her I might not be home before nightfall . " " I reckon you took your gun with you ? " Armitage asked . Fort was on his feet at once . " Judge McGowan , I object . The prosecutor is putting words into the witness 's mouth . What Mr. Armitage reckons ' and what Mr. Bemis did are two separate matters . Let Mr. Armitage reckon ' all he wants . But let him put direct questions to the witness . Not make suggestions . " " Objection sustained , " said McGowan . " Mr. Prosecutor , question the witness directly . " Armitage , with a great show of being obliging , rephrased his question . " Did you take a gun with you , Mr. Bemis ? " " I did , " answered Bemis . " Why ? " asked Armitage . Fort was again on his feet . " I object . By asking Why ? ' Mr. Armitage would like to lead the jury to believe that Mr. Bemis went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indians . Mr. Armitage may live in the capital of this great state of Indiana , but he knows as well as I do , and as every man on the jury does also , that no man up here and in his right senses goes five hundred feet from his house without a gun . " " Objection overruled , " said McGowan.  | Armitage repeated his question , " Why the gun , Mr. Bemis ? " " Habit , mostly , " said Bemis . " And good sense . " " Where did you go after leaving the house ? " " We went toward the shack where Jud Clasby has been living since he came back here . On the way he showed me two small piles of corn . You do n't usually find piles of corn out in the woods far from any barn lot . I wondered about them . Clasby said he figured they had been put there by the Indians to toll the horses away from his place . " " Did you see any tracks around the corn ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At the time , I thought the horse tracks were Clasby 's and the moccasin tracks Indians ' . I think now I was tricked . " " Why ? How ? " " I was tricked by somebody 's putting that corn there and seeing that some horses come to it . The idea was to make my blood boil at Indian thievery  --  and it did boil . There 's nothing lower than a horse thief  --  but my only thought then was to get the horses back to Clasby . Clasby said , Let 's go to the sugar camp and see if the horses are there . ' That was agreeable to me , the only reasonable thing to do . " Before we started out , Clasby asked me into his shack . He got out a bottle and took a pull on it himself . Then he handed it to me . When I was converted , I gave up drink . I 'm not myself when drinking . I do things and afterward I do n't know why I done them . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many a bottle together . I thought maybe going without it for so long had settled me down so drink would n't work on me the way it had when I was younger . I was wrong . If anything , it worked on me harder . I was drunk . While we were still at the shack , Benson , the two Woods , and the Cape boy came along . " " Did these men have guns ? " " All but the Cape boy . He was just traipsing along because young Wood is his friend . " " Did they drink ? " " Benson and old Wood had a pull , but by that time the supply was about finished . " " What happened next ? " " We went to the sugar camp . It was agreed that the two Woods , Benson , and the Cape boy would stay in camp with the women and children , while me and Jud Clasby , with the help of the two Indian bucks , went to hunt for the horses . " 131  | " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what made you think they 'd lead you to them ? " " We did n't think that . If they stole them , they 'd lead us as far away from them as possible . They 'd lay down a cold track . " " What was the idea of taking them with you ? " " The plan was to kill them . " " Whose plan was this ? " " Clasby 's . But I went along with it . I was took in by the corn and the tracks . And by the whiskey . I was thinking the way I did when I was Clasby 's pardner out west and every redskin was our enemy . I was ready to kill then ! I thought I 'd be saving our own lives in the long run . That 's what I thought . " " What happened when you got to the sugar camp ? " " First of all , the Indian squaws gave us food . They always do . It sobered me up some , but not enough to bring me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he 'd told me  --  horses stolen . What he said to them was horses strayed . ' Would the two men help us look for them ? Tall Tree did n't think much of this plan . He said , How do you know but maybe if I go , I shoot white man ? ' " Clasby joshed with Tall Tree , saying , White man has had more practice with guns than the red man . ' " Tall Tree did n't argue about this . More practice , ' he agreed . But red man shoot faster . ' " Red Cloud , a leader among the Indians and a man very open and friendly to whites , said he 'd be glad to help . " Red Cloud went with me , Tall Tree with Clasby . Clasby had told me what he would do and what he wanted me to do . When I heard the sound of his gun , it would be a signal that he had killed Tall Tree , and that I was to kill Red Cloud . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this plan ? " " Compunction ? " " Second thoughts ? Twinges of conscience ? " " I did , yes . But by now I was bound by an agreement . I 'd told Clasby what I 'd do , and I 've never been a man to back down once I 've given my word . " " So you thought it was better to kill a man than to break your word to a man who 'd fooled you into murder . " " I did n't know I 'd been fooled then . And I was drunk . " At this point Fort again interrupted . " Judge McGowan , may I put a question to the witness ? "  | " . This is irregular , " replied McGowan , " but with the prosecutor 's permission , I 'll grant you your request . " Mr. Armitage , a man who knew he had nothing to lose , granted the permission . " Mr. Bemis , " said Fort , " you keep telling us you were drunk . But you also keep remembering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . You remember what the squaws fed you . My belief , Mr. Bemis , is that a man as drunk as you say you were could not remember such small happenings . My belief , however , is that you were indeed as drunk as you say you were . I know something about your past life . I know what a little corn liquor can do for you . I believe that you were just as drunk as you claim . But that what you are now passing off as what you remembered are items you 've let Mr. Armitage , for reasons best known to you and Armitage , persuade you to present as remembered . ' Is n't that true , Mr. Bemis ? Mr. Armitage 's not your lawyer , Mr. Bemis . Do n't you know that ? Are you still drunk ? Do n't you know what Mr. Armitage has in mind for you ? " " I know what Mr. Armitage has in mind for me , " Bemis answered , steady as a rock . " That 's his business . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't tell me a thing to say . He listened to me . That 's all he did . It may be I 've made out I was drunker than I was just to ease my conscience . I would n't say that 'd be past me . Even now . " Armitage , with the generosity of a winner , said , " Are there any more questions you 'd like to ask the witness , Mr. Fort ? " Fort bowed out of the exchange with all of the poise he could muster . " Thank you , Mr. Prosecutor . For the time being , that is all . " Armitage then continued from the point where he 'd been interrupted by Fort . " My question was , Mr. Bemis , did you think it better to kill than to break your word to a man who had fooled you into murder ? And your answer was that you did n't know then that you had been fooled . And that you were also drunk . Is that still your answer ? " " It is . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believed a man 's life was of less account than your word to a murderer ? " " Nobody up to then had ever called Clasby a murderer . And he was my pardner . And just how drunk I was , I do n't know , but I was drunk , and keeping my word to Clasby seemed the right thing to do . So that 's what I done . " " How did you persuade this Indian , who had no reason to trust a 133  | white man , to go off with you on a trumped-up search for horses that were n't lost ? " " I told you Red Cloud was goodhearted and friendly to whites . I did n't have to do any persuading . He went along just as helpful as if he 'd been looking for his own horse . " " You know who 's in this courtroom listening to your words ? " " I 'm looking straight at them . I 'm confessing to them as much as to anybody . More to them than anybody except God . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " An honest confession may set you right with God . But the Indians want more than that . You understand that , do you , Mr. Bemis ? " " I understand that . " Judge McGowan decided to get Armitage and Bemis back on the track of the trial proper , which was : Who killed Red Cloud ? " Honest confession , " he agreed , " is good for the soul , be it to man or God . But this trial will last from July to eternity if it 's opened up to all the confessions that might be , and maybe ought to be , made here . But this is , however , a circuit court , and I got dates elsewhere and soon . Mr. Armitage , let 's get on with what the witness did after he left the camp with Red Cloud . " Armitage then said , " Mr. Bemis , you have heard Judge McGowan . " " Well , after we left the camp , I let Red Cloud range on up ahead of me , making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep him in front of me . He was about thirty steps ahead of me when I heard a shot from the direction Clasby and Tall Tree had gone . " A shot from Clasby was the signal for me to finish off Red Cloud . Red Cloud turned at the sound of the shot toward me , and I bungled my shot . I hit him in the belly . The shot went clear through him , and blood spurted out front and back . I wish to God I could forget Red Cloud 's look . He could n't believe I 'd done it . He was helping me and I shot him . He said , You kill me ? ' " " Well , what did you say to that , Mr. Bemis ? " " I did n't say a word . What could I say ? I 'm saying it now . I hope Red Cloud can hear me . " Bemis , who up to this point had spoken without much emotion , buried his face in his hands . What he had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearly heard . Judge McGowan said , " Take your hands down , Mr. Bemis . We ca n't hear you . " Lawyer Armitage had n't become state prosecutor by being a man who did n't press an advantage when it was given him .  | " I ca n't vouch for what Red Cloud can hear , Mr. Bemis , but I ca n't hear you , either , and I am listening very carefully . " " Mr. Bemis , " McGowan said , " you asked for this chance to speak .  | It 's out of order for you to do so , and we have interrupted the usual order of things to let you do so . Now you 'll have to take your hands down so that we can hear what you are saying . Otherwise you can step down . " Bemis straightened up at once . His eyes were dry as sandstones . His supply of tears had long since been used up . " I ask the court 's pardon , " he said . " What came next ai n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was still standing . I do n't know how . Blood was leaving his body by the bucketful . As I came near him , Red Cloud said , If you shoot me again , shoot me through the head . ' By the time I reached him , he had sunk to the ground , but was sitting upright , not sprawled out . He did n't speak or beg , but he was making a sound . A sound anyway was coming from him . It was n't a moan or a scream . It seemed more like something inside him broken and running down . You know the whirr a grindstone makes when you stop pumping ? Red Cloud just sat there , bolt upright , making that sound . And dying like an Indian . I 've seen them die before . Many 's the time . They do n't whimper . They do n't beg for mercy . Red Cloud opened his mouth just enough to let two words out . Finish me . ' I took my knife from my belt , and Red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was asking me to do what I done . There was no wrong in that . It was the first shot that was wrong . " " What was it you did ? " Armitage asked . " I cut his throat . " " And he thanked you for it ? " " He did . He thanked me with his eyes ' til they closed . That 's one reason I 'm here . I want to say Red Cloud done no wrong . That I killed him while drunk , and that he died like a brave man . " " Why have you made this confession ? " McGowan asked . " Were you coerced by the prosecution ? " " I made it to get some peace with God and my soul . " There had n't been a sound in the courtroom during Bemis 's confession . The listeners held their breaths as much as if they 'd been out there in the woods watching the whole affair  --  the tracking , the gunshot , the blood , the knife at the throat , more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if , in view of Bemis 's full confession and of his expressed desire to share the jail with those already 135  | accused and indicted , the formality of a grand jury indictment for him might be overlooked . Before Judge McGowan could agree or disagree , Charlie Fort was on his feet . " May I cross-examine the witness ? " Judge McGowan , surprised , said , " Yes . " Fort planted himself in front of Bemis , but turned aside enough so that the courtroom could see Bemis 's face . " Mr. Bemis , " he said , " have you any witness who can substantiate the truth of what you 've just said ? " Bemis , who had sunk back into a kind of torpor after the ordeal of the confession , appeared not to take in the import of what he 'd been asked . Fort reworded his question . " Did anyone see you do what you claim to have done ? " This question struck those in the courtroom as ridiculous . Did a man who confessed killing have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't give the rustle of what was the beginning of a nervous titter a chance to break out into a laugh . " There have been numerous cases of confessions of crimes by men who never committed them . In Clinton County , Ohio , two years ago , a man confessed to the murder of his wife who had disappeared . By virtue of that confession , the man was tried and had been sentenced to hang when his wife turned up alive . " Armitage interrupted Charlie without a by-your-leave from the judge . " Counselor Fort , if Red Cloud turns up alive , I 'll gladly accept your argument that Mr. Bemis did not kill him . " The onlookers did laugh at that . But Charlie Fort was too nimblewitted not to have foreseen such a rejoinder from Armitage . " Mr. Prosecutor , " he said , " I had addressed a question to the witness . Will you be so kind as to let him testify ? You , " he said to Armitage , " will be given ample time for your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ witnesses to this act ? " Bemis answered , " Besides Red Cloud , you mean ? " This answer appeared to astound even Fort . He answered very gently , as if to a sick man . " Yes , I mean besides Red Cloud . " Bemis shook his head . " The two of us were alone . Just me and Red Cloud . First I shot him . Then I cut his throat . He asked me to do that . " " If the court will have a little more patience with me , I would  | like to cite another Ohio case . This was in Bartholomew County , where a man testified to a killing he did not commit . " Judge McGowan was getting impatient . " We 're not overly interested down here in miscarriages of justice in Ohio . " " You 're interested in justice , Judge . This case has bearing on that . A man in Ohio assumed the blame for a killing there because of a debt he felt he owed a friend . I submit to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time of the shooting , does not know but that Clasby killed Red Cloud . He admits that he did what Clasby told him to do . What proof is there that he is not now saying what Clasby told him to say ? " Before this unthought-of possibility had time to sink fully into the minds of those in the courtroom , Ora Bemis , pushing past the knees of the Cape family , ran toward her husband . " Yes , yes . That 's what happened . That 's what happened , Mr. Fort . Lute told me . He said he had to tell it the way he has ; Jud Clasby saved his life once out west . Now he wants to take the blame off Jud 's shoulders for the killing of Red Cloud . " Ora , unwieldy with the child she was carrying , went on to where her husband sat , dropped to her knees and looked up into his face . " Tell them , Lute , you did n't do it . Tell them what you told me . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't say a word . He bent forward , put his cheek against Ora 's , and stroked her hair . It was a hard scene to interrupt , but Armitage did so . He had not built his career as prosecutor on softheartedness . " Judge McGowan , may I call the court 's attention to the fact that Mr. Fort , by placing the blame for the death of Red Cloud on Mr. Clasby , has not lifted the charge of murder from Bemis . He is not suggesting , is he , that Clasby murdered both Red Cloud and Tall Tree ? All he has done is to prey on the feelings of an overwrought wife , insult the intelligence of this jury , and harm the case of his client . " Fort , Caleb Cape , and Bemis , who had also risen , began to speak together . Judge McGowan , an old hand at outbreaks in rural courtrooms , gaveled them all into silence . It was already well past the noon hour . Food was overdue and might settle tempers and restore a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours for dinner , " he said . 137  | The day after Bemis 's confession was Thursday . Judge McGowan was down again with another bout of his intermittent fever . At McGowan 's request , and because they had no wish to stumble through this tangled legal forest without an experienced guide , both side judges moved to postpone the trial until the next morning . That Thursday had an unreal feeling to it ; people were uncertain what the confession meant and how they felt about it . The postponement heightened this sense of bewilderment and , during the morning , a stunned silence lay over Pendleton . But by midafternoon some of the shock had worn off and the town began to chatter like a family facing a new , unexpected problem . Charlie Fort had prevailed upon his landlady to provide a little supper for him and Hannah Cape that evening . " Norry , " he said ( Mrs. Culligan 's name was Norah , but Charlie had long since left " Mrs. Culligan " behind and called her by the name used by her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a boardinghouse and that you only took me in out of the kindness of your heart . But I wonder if you could give me and Hannah Cape a little supper to-night ? " " As you said , Charlie , I 'm not running a boardinghouse . " " It 's this way , Norry . What with her family and that raft of cousins they 're staying with here in town , to say nothing of the brother she carries around like a helpless papoose , she now has O. A. Dilk pawing around her like an ox . . . . " " Like a bull , " Norry corrected him . That was a word Charlie , who had been brought up not to name male animals before ladies , would not repeat , though he recognized the greater accuracy of Norry 's description . " Pawing , ' anyway , " he agreed . " Well , with all this going on , about my only chance to talk to Hannah alone is here . Or take her out for a little walk in the woods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose . "  | " Do n't think I do n't know that . That 's why I thought it 'd be a lot nicer here . " " It would be , " Norry said . For her , too , Norry thought . She was a woman of good sense as well as passion . Her good sense did n't deny the passion but provided ways , when it was possible , for bits of the passion to be expressed . Her preference would have been to cook a supper that she and Charlie could eat alone together . That being out of the question , why deny herself the pleasure of hearing Charlie laugh and talk , of seeing him throw back his long silky cowlick and stretch out his long strongthighed legs . Say no to him about this supper and he would traipse off to the woods with that big redhead . Who would be the gainer by that ? In her own day , when she was dark and sparkling , Charlie would never have given that big redhead a second glance . Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge , had learned how to turn back the clocks . Turn them ahead and make Charlie her age ? That was n't what she wanted , either . What she wanted was the girl she had been to be with the young man Charlie was . That girl was alive inside her , a sleeping beauty now to others , but wide awake to herself . That girl did n't need any kiss to wake her up , but , alas , no kiss of hers would wake another . " You courting this girl , Charlie ? " " I have n't asked her to marry me , if that 's what you mean . " " That 's what I mean . " " I 've only known her two weeks and talked to her three times . I do n't want to scare her to death . " " I guarantee you wo n't scare her . What would you like for supper ? " What they had for supper Charlie did n't know . The table was set pretty , not in the kitchen , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a nice little slow-burning fire of oakwood in the grate . The table was the one Norry used at night to play patience on and in the daytime for rolling out pastry and cutting up pieplant in the kitchen . It was covered with a tablecloth and decorated with a little jug filled with the first Johnny-jump-ups of spring . There was n't a restaurant in Cincinnati that could 've provided them with a turnout any more stylish . And not half so comfortable . Hannah made Charlie proud . She was n't a preacher 's daughter for nothing . She knew how to talk to strangers , was accustomed to put-139  | ting them at their ease . She admired the table , smelled the flowers , helped Norry bring the food from the kitchen . When the supper was on the table , Norry said , " Now there 's more where this came from . You help yourselves . I 've promised to go sit with old Sam Randall for a spell tonight . He 's down with lung fever and his poor wife has n't had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home . If I ai n't back before you leave , Hannah , I 'm pleased to have met you . " Norry shut two doors firmly between her and the young couple and went down the path toward the Randalls ' . If she could n't be happy with Charlie , she could at least be happy with herself . She had done the right thing . Cleared out . Done unto others as she would be done by . Die a Christian if not a sweetheart . When the last of the two doors closed , Charlie and Hannah , moving slowly , as if carried by a wave or by the wind , went into each other 's arms . They fit there . They felt an ache each had endured since the last clasping disappeared . They did not need to kiss , or want to . That was too special . It denied the all-overness of the pressure of cheeks and arms and thighs . They were not ready yet for anything so concentrated as a kiss . It was enough to have the feel of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Charlie . " " Hannah , Hannah . " Such beautiful sounds . They could n't get their fill of those words . They delighted their mouths with them . After a time they remembered the table . " What 're we going to do with all this food , Hannah ? " Hannah , practical as well as lovesick , her stomach growling with hunger , said , " It would hurt Mrs. Culligan 's feelings to leave it untouched . " They ate , or tried to eat , one-handed . They could not unclasp hands . Hannah 's throat , though her stomach was hungry , felt swollen . Food went down painfully . She gave up trying to swallow and watched Charlie . He had been talking all day , going over the case with his fellow lawyers . He ate , but slowly , as if he , too , found it a task ; he swallowed like a man taking a dose of medicine . " Oh , Charlie , " she said . " Yes , Hannah ? " She wanted to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I will never be separated from you all the days of my life . " But he had n't said , " I love you , " yet . A woman who said that first could drive a  | man off with her forwardness . The game was hide-and-seek , and it was the woman 's place to hide and the man 's to seek . Otherwise , no game . She said , " I thought what you said yesterday about Luther Bemis 's maybe lying to spare Clasby was good . " " You were about the only one . " " Ora Bemis thought it was good . " " Do you think it 's true ? " " No . " " Neither do I. But that jury needs to be given some doubts . Otherwise they 'll decide to string up those fellows just to save their own necks . " " They would n't do that . " " What do you think that row of Indians is standing back there for ? " " To let them see we are keeping our word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " There is another reason . Do n't think Colonel Johnston does n't want everyone to have a good look at the customers the Pendleton and Fall Creek folks might have to deal with if the murderers are n't hanged . " " Hanged ? They would n't hang poor Johnny Wood , would they ? " " If he 's found guilty , that 's what Johnston expects . But I 've got a trick or two up my sleeve yet . That jury ought never to have been seated ' til each man was asked if he 'd vote guilty ' just to stave off an Indian attack . " " Would anybody admit to that ? " " I do n't know . But they ought to have been asked . And the fact they were n't might be grounds for charging a mistrial . " " What 's a mistrial ? " Charlie put down his fork , took both Hannah 's hands in his , and groaned , " My God , I 've lost my mind . Mistrial ! Miss Cape is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to lawyers for so many days I 've forgotten there 's anything but Indians and trials and murderers in the whole state of Indiana . I did n't ask you to have supper with me for any more talk like that . " " What kind of talk ? " Hannah asked , so bold her eardrums pounded with blood . Charlie closed his eyes and laughed . Then he opened them wide . " You want me to say it ? " " I think so . " 141  | " My darling Hannah Cape , I love you . " " I love you , Charlie Fort . " They leaned across the table , ready to kiss now . Charlie 's cuff dragged in the gravy bowl . " We 've got to get rid of this damned table , " Charlie said . Hannah 's startled look reminded Charlie that he was talking to a preacher 's daughter . He would n't get fined for every damn and hell he said here , but his stock would n't go up any with her , either . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " I told you I was out of my mind . Let 's get rid of the table and some of the food . We do n't want Norry to think we ate so little after all the trouble she took . You help me carry the table to the kitchen and we 'll give the leftovers to the dog . " When they came back from the kitchen , they stood in the center of the sitting room like actors waiting for a cue . They had said " love " and the dialogue from now on would be different . Charlie had some familiarity with the next lines , but Hannah was tongue-tied . She expected " Marry me " next , to which she would instantly say " Yes , " go home and start plucking geese for feather beds and hemming linen for sheets . Charlie said , " You are the most beautiful girl I have ever seen . " This was n't a proposal , but it was perhaps the kind of talk that should come before a proposal , like grace before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-conscious . She hid her face against Charlie 's shoulder  --  he was tall enough so she could do that . The minute she did so , she did n't care about proposals . Or anyone speaking , she or Charlie . Her body spoke , " Touch me , touch me , touch me , " and Charlie 's body heard and answered . They were strong enough for kissing now , and kissing was strong enough for a time . But what their lips felt , their blood carried to every other part of the body . Norry Culligan came home at the decent hour of ten . First into the kitchen , then opening the door into the sitting room  --  which was also her bedroom . There in front of the fire , built up enough to shed some light as well as heat , naked as jaybirds , lay Hannah Cape and Charlie Fort , sound asleep and fondly entwined . Norry stared for a time , then quietly closed the door to the kitchen . What did you expect , she wondered . Then she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down at the table where the two had eaten , and cried . Tom , she thought , though in her thinking she was talking 142  | to Tom , the husband of her youth , not thinking of the Tom dead and in his grave , and she the old widow . It was you and me I saw there . Do n't think me a silly old woman . I 'll never do anything to shame you , Tom . I 'm your true wife ' til they lay me in the grave beside you . But I feel . I have n't stopped feeling . If I was the one who had gone , and you the one who had stayed , you would 've remarried long before this . But no one asked me , Tom . No one I 'd have , after you . No old sack of bones like Mr. Wood . Charlie 's the spit and image of you the first day I saw you . I wo n't shame you and I wo n't make a nuisance of myself to Charlie . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help crying . Norry put her head on the table and cried a big wet splotch of tears that quickly spread on the white linen tablecloth . Then she got up . Those two must put their clothes on and Charlie must get Hannah back to her home . She took the poor cat out of its nighttime crib in the woodbox , and set him on the step . " Run for your life , Goldie , " she said . Scooter could never catch the big tom , but he 'd sit under the tree Goldie climbed and bark for an hour . If that did n't arouse the young people , she 'd clatter around in the kitchen until she did it herself . Goldie ran , Scooter after her , baying . Norry went behind the springhouse , out of sight from the house , and leaned there until she heard the house door close . She watched the young people , arms around each other , move off quickly under the light of a moon growing toward its full . Inside the house she went to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table by the door that led to the attic room  --  as she always did when Charlie came in after her bedtime . She went to sleep at once . The light was gone when sometime later she awakened and turned over . Upstairs at his table , Charlie blessed old Scooter , still prowling around growling at cats , he imagined , and at real raccoons and polecats , likely . Except for that dog , he and Hannah would have been still lying there on the floor when Norry came home  --  or , worse still , when Hannah 's father came looking for her . That would have been a pretty howdy-do . Well , pretty , all right , depending on who looked at them ; but a howdy-do for certain . With Scooter 's help they were up , dressed , and out of the house with no one the wiser . Charlie was of two states of mind at the same time , and each state was the absolute opposite of the other : so happy and keyed up , sleep 143  | might never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sleep , if he closed his eyes it might be a few days before he opened them again . Go to sleep and dream for two or three days ; dream that that long naked body , pink and gold in the fire glow , never once left his side . He went to the washstand , poured the bowl full of water and doused his head in it . He had his weekly letter to write for the Spy ? and yesterday 's happenings were real news , not storytelling about strange doings in the backwoods . Though a man led off to jail without any indictment by the grand jury , and without any witness to the truth of what he was saying , simply because he was determined to go to jail , was a far step from a jury trial as they knew it in Cincinnati . He recounted the factual happenings of the day before  --  not of this night  --  to his father . Then he could not resist a lapse into commentary . Extracts from a letter by Charles Fort to Enoch Leverett @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experienced yesterday , the trial of George Benson will at last begin tomorrow . Benson , before he had any idea that he would be brought to trial for killing an Indian , boasted at a public meeting of his part in the killings . The two Woods were with him at the time , but both the Wood men and Benson have , since the trial began , refused to speak of the part played by the others in the affair . So we have the peculiar circumstances of three men in jail because they themselves boasted of what they considered a good deed , and of a fourth now there because he feels he has committed a crime . And thus far , unless the men start accusing each other , there are no witnesses to the killings they claim they committed . It is a trial based upon circumstantial evidence . No one saw the crimes committed , and the accused are jailed on say-so only , albeit their own . It is also constitutionally questionable whether the court can , after two hundred years of recognizing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reverse itself and declare such killing to be a crime . Another circumstance , having to do with the trial but not with its constitutionality , is the presence of Black Antler , the Indian teacher of the boy Folded Leaf , who was killed . Black Antler is what the Indians call a prophet , a follower of the famous Handsome Lake . Black Antler preaches and teaches Handsome Lake 's doctrines . One of these was that no one should be put to death for any crime . Handsome Lake was a Seneca from Pennsylvania who was influenced by the Quakers there . What he preaches is four-fifths Indian and one-144  | fifth Quaker . Either alone is hard to swallow , and the combination sticks in most throats . Particularly when Black Antler argues that Colonel Johnston is wrong when he says that the men who killed the Indians must , if found guilty , be hanged . When Black Antler , a Seneca , which of all the tribes has been the most revengeful and bloody , argues against the hanging of men who killed his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his argument but a plot : a plot to provide the northern tribes , if Johnston and Calhoun 's promise for strict justice is ignored , an excuse to swoop down on the settlements here , ravage , burn , and kill . Here is this old Indian arguing for mercy for the accused while even the families of the accused think he 's likely scheming to provide an excuse for his kinsmen to kill them all . Black Antler preaching charity , while half or more here think Johnston , preaching hanging , is on the right track . Hang the four hotheads who did the killing , five , if they can catch Clasby , and save the lives of the hundred or more an Indian uprising would be sure to wipe out . There are others who argue that the thing to do is to get a detachment of army regulars in here , march north with them , and put an end once and for all to the Indian menace in this area . It 's going to have to be done sooner or later , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red man strikes first . With Calhoun heading up the Department of War and Johnston in charge of Indian Affairs for the Northwest Territory , it 's unlikely the government will send soldiers to put down a rising of Indians ? who have n't risen  --  Indians who , to boot , have as an excuse for doing so  --  the murder of their kinsmen . This community is split down the middle in its opinion as to what should be done . Half think that Johnston was right in promising the Indians a trial of the killers and punishment under the law if found guilty . Half think that no promises should have been made and that the Indians should have been dealt with as they always have been before , with force . It sometimes appears that there will never be any need for another Indian raid on Fall Creek . Neighbor will have fallen upon neighbor and by the time the redskins arrive their erstwhile settlement will be extinct as the result of civil war . Two families , unable to face the prospect of watching friends condemned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of being themselves killed ? have already pulled out . And more are threatening to leave . More guns are being carried here now and more prayers being said 145  | than at any time since Pendleton was founded . The combination may seem odd . But they represent the debate going on in men 's minds : What is the right thing to do ? What is the safe thing ? Pendleton does n't know the answer to these questions . Pa , I wish I could talk over this trial with you . The job ahead of me is n't easy . As I see it , I must do three things  --  and the last may be impossible . 1 . Recall to the minds of the jurors what settlers have suffered at the hands of the Indians . 2 . Bear down hard on the fact that these men had been brought up to believe that killing an Indian served a better purpose than killing a deer . 3 . Root out , if I can , somebody who will testify that these Indians by some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm up against tough opposition . Armitage , the state prosecutor , is hard as nails and with a mind like a bear trap . O. A. Dilk , his assistant , is young , ambitious , and wily . I think he sees winning this trial as his first step toward the Presidency . The senator hides his experience and determination behind a mask of urbanity . But he did n't come out to this little backwoods town to lose , that 's certain . Well , you better pray for Charlie , Pa . Also , you better prepare to meet a Hoosier daughter-in-law before too long . I 'm following your advice and not talking about Hannah . But you did n't advise me to stop seeing her  --  and I 'm following your advice there , too . End of extracts from a letter by Charles Fort to Enoch Leverett . Charlie had outlasted his bout of sleepiness . What he would like to do now was get into bed with Hannah , sleep with his face tangled up in that mane of her long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cousins ' , the Baldwin , sleeping , no doubt , on a pallet in the loft with a half-dozen girl cousins tucked in around her . He undressed in front of the opened window . The moon had set and there was only one light to be seen  --  the light in the window of the old man Norry had been sitting with , perhaps dying at this very minute of his lung fever . Charlie could see the jail , merely a dark outline , of course . You did n't go to jail with any expectation of being able to stay up all night playing seven-up or reading . He wondered what Bemis thought of jail now that he had talked himself into it . If I was ever so crazy as to kill a man , Charlie thought , I 'd keep 146  | my mouth shut . But perhaps confession was a part of the craziness : kill and tell . He did n't expect to sleep . Thinking about what had happened only made him crazy to have it happen again . He envied Norry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There were some advantages to being a woman , especially a woman of a grandmother 's age . He was asleep before the feather bed had completed its enfolding movements . 147
