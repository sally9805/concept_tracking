Lamf . 74 A story by Patricia Duncan HE LADIES ' NOSES were painted with one quick stroke , a slash , a brown line . And those noses were vital . For although they never looked much like real ones , they were the closest I 'd been . If the brush was too wet and the color ran , if the curve began too soon , I threw the page away . For they were to be noses , not scars ; noses , not misplaced ponytails . That evening I made my slash and my moment of intensity was gone . Putting aside the paints , I withdrew further into the raveling wicker chair . It was here , in the garden daily at dusk , that I spread my feet among the phlox , weeds , and periwinkles to feel ashamed . I heard her now , banging about the pots in the kitchen as she explained to the cat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today . I knew that Zephyr did not mind scrubbing macaroni from a pot while I hurried outside after dinner with my paints . In fact , Zephyr offered to do it ; she handed me the watercolors and said : " You do n't feel so hot , mama ? " No , it was n't feeling that my daughter resented taking over duties normally left to mothers that made me feel so guilty . Actually , Zephyr thought it great fun to collect rent from the roomers , telling them how to operate the air conditioners as she carefully printed their receipts . And it was n't that Zephyr was the one who- ran off for the plunger when the toilet was plugged up or that she held the raisin bread to the light to see if it was molding when she thought it should he . No , it was none of that . It was the fact that the girl was ten years old and painted artificial eyes soaking in glass teacups and unicorns wearing sandals while I continued to paint the same ladies I had done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could amuse herself indefinitely with a magnet and a tiny metal Chevrolet , alone . It was , after all , the fact that Zephyr rais herself which caused me to dribble colors typing paper each evening . And it was a lo a woman had given me in a grocery store d morning that made me feel especially disgu ing as I wiggled my brush in the violet . Zeph had been asking the stock boy where the food was . " The dry cat food , " she had e phasized , " the mackerel and salmon actual ! , as I stood behind the cart gazing at my ei des . The woman , who came speeding tow ( me from the detergent aisle , had shot mt glare clearly asking : " Why ca n't you do it And so I had rather meekly approached Ze ? yr and self-consciously taken her hand . I sat staring now at my nails with th chipped polish and thought how easy it to paint Zephyr 's , who was , by the way , par to an obnoxious orchid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little nail , m ing only a slight squiggle , and then she wo do mine , biting her lower lip in concentrati At that moment , Zephyr came out with Japanese roomer . " Mama , Schozo 's going to stay anot month , " she said , smiling and patting hand . She seemed fragile as a fawn be : him , a cat 's whisker , a shimmering chande prism . She had recently cut her own d bangs and not done such a bad job , ex ( that they dipped in the center in a vagi vampish way . " You are ? " I said as Schozo bent his torso forward in a bow . " Well , we 're ha to have you . Is there anything you need ? " cocked his head uncertainly ; Zephyr cle : her-throat and faced him . " Do you need towels ? " she said slo making a rectangle in the air . " Towel ? Oh , no , have three , " he answe " Have everything . " " What are you painting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with that same g ( ? osity she always had , a curiosity I was e had to be pretended , and I reacted with same guilty shrug . Oh , you know , another lady . " " q , rhat 's this one 's name ? " she asked quick-for that was the only use for the pictures , choosing of names . Timm , well , I thought she would be ... d red . " Mildred ! " Zephyr laughed . " Mildred ! How . ut Mildew ? " And she chuckled and hopped ut with her joke . Mildew , okay , I guess that might fit her i that dingy gray dress . " Zephyr took the , 311 and painted " MILDEW " in black , makspider webs droop from each letter . Schozo ; hed , too , nodding and pointing at the ure . She make bugs by lady 's head , " he said . Schozo 's going to be on TV again Satur , " Zephyr said . " I told him we 'd watch . " chozo approached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " In ring , " he said , ing a circle , " jump on finger . " He stomped w times . " Hurt finger . " told him I was sorry , but it was an occu : nal hazard , a rather minor one , and he Lid expect such things . None of which he understood . So / asked him if some ice might help . " Ice , yes , later . " " You do n't have to wrestle tonight ? " He shook his head . " I was thinking of some wine . Would you care for a glass ? " He leaned forward in confusion and looked at Zephyr . " Wine , " she said . " It 's kind of like beer . " " Beer ? Oh , yes , thank you . " " No , wine , it 's ? " " I 'll just get some , " I said , starting to rise . But Zephyr was already on her way to the kitchen . Schozo sat and fondled his finger . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a private little pain , that my daughter communicated with him better than I , that her eagerness and efficiency smoothed the edges . For children can be better than adults with foreigners , the acquisition of language having not yet completely left their memories . 14 E SAT SILENTLY as the light 4 dimmed and a stray breeze knocked about the garden 's pet-als , pistils , and stamens , and I wondered how Schozo could be so gentle by vliot.44,4,11 , - 5,40 , . , ? , viive , ? : 1torimAti-4.,0 , - 4400,10- w , O , v , **27;2334;TOOLONG , ; : ki:Lito , r#10 , xtiN000,1 day when at night , wearing a black mask and greased with sweat , he beat people up for a living . " But I 've heard that the fights are n't for real , " Zephyr had told me . And she would know . " It is too hot , " Schozo said , wiping his chin . " Yes , " I answered , although I had n't noticed , not even in the silk robe I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zephyr came out with a tray , a bottle of Chablis , and three wineglasses , hers filled with Hawaiian Punch . She handed a glass to Schozo , who in his thirst downed it before I had tasted mine . " Where is father ? " he suddenly blurted . I instinctively threw Zephyr a somewhat panicked glance . " Gone , " was her reply between pursed-lipped sips of punch . " Ah , " he breathed , swabbing his forehead with his shirt sleeve . " Are you ever hurt badly in your work ? " Zephyr asked him , doing a rather beautiful job of subject changing , as she mustered up a look of extreme interest which obviously flattered him . Yes , a much better job than I could have done , for I had urgently snatched up the hem of my dress to pointlessly inspect the stitching . " Hurt bad ? Oh , no , but one time . One time cut head pretty bad . " " I do n't see a scar , " Zephyr said , going forward to examine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " With a sigh , Zephyr picked up her glass and said she was going inside to do some chores , meaning she might brush the cat , check on the pregnant guppy , or wash her hair . " Call me if you need me , " she shouted as she closed the door , and I wondered when she would tire of looking after mother . " Most people would never worry about the well-being of such a child , " I said suddenly . inunediately retreated into my chair , hoping Schozo would ignore the remark , one I thought terribly foolish , I tried never to discuss my worrying about Zephyr , my own lethargy , or , more important , my ten-year-old astonishment over being someone 's mother . I poured us more wine . " You worry about your little girl ? " " Oh , a little , " I said with a casual shrug that came off more phonily than I had hoped . " She sick ? " " No , she 's very healthy , " " She is happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I asked quickly . " Why worry ? " " Well , I do , " I murmured , and a new wave of it filled me . There were days when I sr hours agonizing over the name I had gi her . You can take chances when you nam pet or a racehorse or a boat ; you can be bizarre as you like . But not with your ( child . Zephyr and I often laughed about names we christened my watercolored and I wondered if my daughter had h named , say , Jane , would we laugh at Zeph But there had been a reason for it , a good at the time . " Do you think she has a strange nal Weird name ? Bad name ? " " No , very pretty . " But then , to a Japanese , Mary would b odd as Zephyr , would n't it ? " Well , her father was a peteorolog Schozo grinned and nodded which mean did not understand . " A weatherman .. television like you , says if it will rain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said loudly with a long meaning he got it . " Or if there will he a west wind , wes wind , or a soft breeze . And , well , she w ; a common thing and could n't have a corn name and that was all of him she would you know ? " Schozo nodded and grinned . I gave us another dollop of wine . " I see him on television ? " " Not here . " " He on trip ? " " I do n't know where he is . She do really mind not having him , I do n't think . then I do n't know what she does mind . A things , she hates liver , wool blankets , cards . She likes board games with dice fake money and all that . She likes winter than summer ; she was born in Februar that might have something to do with it I saw that Schozo was leaning forward that look I 'd seen on faces in the lang lab when people were frantically thin Ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gab like that ? " You not married to man on telev now ? " " We were never married . " " Not married ? " he asked loudly with a long nod . . " We did n't know each other very about three weeks . In another city .

" I worry because it 's been ten years and I still have to convince myself that I have this child .

" " Father not know he have Zephyr ? " he asked , worrying a little himself now . " No . I did n't know about her myself for quite a while , being just as sort of irresponsible then as now . Only when she let me know that coffee and cigarettes were against her principles about , I guess , three months along . " " You not get lonely sometime ? " " I have some friends . " And that was another thing . Perhaps it was going a bit too far when Zephyr welcomed the few stray males who stayed the night . If there was anything she resented about them , it was not their hours in my room , but their premeditated smiling , their offering to play jacks with her . She did not like jacks and let them know by hauling out Monopoly , which they hated because that meant a good two hours . " Why you never tell father ? " Schozo asked , helping himself to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the father . That was eleven years ago ; he had merely been there . He had , like the rest of them , sperm and the habit of leaving the toilet seat up . While pointing at the temperatures in Tucson and Phoenix , his teeth and shirt looked white and well eared for ; he read mysteries and had a fetish for lettuce-and-mustard sandwiches . I did not recall him looking anything like Zephyr . That was all 1 remembered , I could n't help it , that was all there was . " It 's not as though it 's such an original case , " I told him . " Maybe another woman would have gone back after him , I do n't know . But it 's more than the fact that she 's fatherless ; I do n't want her to be motherless , too . She 'll never have anything to remember about her father and what 's to make her want to remember how I sat around painting ladies and being childish while she was always so grownup ? " I could tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he wanted to walk the wooden , blue-lanterned corridor to his room . Most likely he would look at his mail with its beautiful Japanese stamps , full of lacy moths and delicate networked trees , all in indigo and rose , before he lay down with snatches of odd American sounds . " Good luck with the wrestling tomorrow , " I told him . " I hope you win . " " Oh , I win . Tomorrow Tuesday , they I me I win , " he answered , bowing . EPHYR WAS cutting pictures from P / tional Geographic in her bedroc filing them meticulously in a lc cardboard box . " Hi , I put some ice in Schozo 's room his linger , " she mumbled , scissoring cards : along a page and then bending over the b I flopped into one of her beanbag cha " Why are you filing that alligator under Oh , I guess it 's a crocodile . " " No , it 's a caiman , a kind of alligator South America . " I seemed to wither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember outsmarting my o mother very often , surely not at ten . Lo it 's bad enough to be put down by your pet by a woman in the supermarket , hairnet and hurrying , by even the Avon lady last w. who told me that the lipstick I stared at not pink , as I thought , but Champagne P f'roste instead . " I suppose , " I said quietly as I flip : through the Us : Urals , Uxmal , Uzbek , " I s pose you do n't think I 'm very bright . " " Well , most people would think it was alligator , mama . It is an alligator , just a vial kind . " " But you knew it was a caiman . " " I just read that it was right here . Se She flashed the magazine at me and remo it before I saw anything . " Does it ever bother you that you know these things and I do n't ? " " Maybe if you read more ? " " I do n't need you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Zephyr said , studiously invo with Ks . She put a pencil behind her ear sat tapping her foot in concentration . I amazed , as usual , at her ability to fall so ily into seriousness , to ignore distraction be , somehow , important in everything she And to ignore me at that moment was ss thing , for I was shamefully greedy for he . tention ; I hummed and sighed , I uncap her perfumes , I switched on the aquas light and startled the neon tetras . " I do read , but there are other things I have to do . " " What do you have to do ? " she asked " What 's that remark ? " I said fairly i lently . " I asked you what you had to do , " Ze repeated , flipping through the magazine stroking her chin pompously . " So why are n't you a professor ? " I a f* , Art k.toil*sor : ; ; Ott  --  eiect , extremely annoyed . I lit a cigarette , slough she forbade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to college first , " she replied , oking up for the first time . " And if you 're ping to smoke , would you please get an ashiy ? I do n't want my room to burn down . " " I can take care of my own ashes . " We 'd en through the cigarette debate before ; last ! ek she 'd brought home a package of little ter gadgets that you attach to the end of the larette . " It 's supposed to filter out 89.2 pernt of the tar and nicotine on your brand , " e had told me . And I obediently used them . " Do you know what your lungs must look e by now ? " she asked me . " Here , let me ow you , " and she hopped off the bed in arch of some book . " I know , black and hideous . Quit being a know-it-all . " " Here , " she said , coming at me with a pie -- e of a horrible exposed lung . " Would you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now knock it off , Zephyr . Just sit down d cut out your pictures like a normal kid . " " Okay , " she answered indifferently , jump-back on the bed . Why did n't Zephyr ever get really angry , I nted to know . And why was I so worried mit her ? After all , she was actually a god-Id ; she could have gone around letting air of people 's tires , spilling nail polish on pets , or swearing . She could have been like children I had babysat for long ago , the ! . s . I had given fifty cents to go to bed , the ! s who had inspired me to invent games in ich the rules were : " Let 's pretend we 're if-mutes so we can see how good we have low . You know , Zephyr , that sometimes you t of , well , make me feel inferior . " Inferior ? Flow come ? " Maybe I do n't mean inferior . Maybe I an that I 'm just not much help to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this ; she was think-about it , very carefully , winding her hair and a finger , biting her lower lip . ' I admit I have n't been the most normal ler. " ' o this , Zephyr tilted her head and squint-at me . I actually had n't planned to be a mother , know , " I told her . " You were sort of a ) rise package . " A good surprise ? " Zephyr , what do you really think about " ' I decided to ask before answering her ; it was something I now needed to know , ething / wanted out of her , quickly , and lie point . What , mama ? Well , I think you 're pretty , " and she came forward to take a handful of my hair . " No , come on , what do you think ? " " You 're a lot better than he is , my lather , " she said shortly , wrinkling her nose and returning to the bed . " You do n't know him . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He does n't know about you . I had to . " " Are n't you glad you know about me ? " And there was some sort of look in her eyes I did n't recognize , that had never been there , an odd little stare which deepened the blue . It was not a pleasant look . It might even have been a frightened look or , in Zephyr , something as rare . " Of course I 'm glad . " Zephyr sat still a moment more , then loosened partially . She then began something quite uncharacteristic ; she fidgeted . She picked at the bedspread , scratched her ear , cleared her throat . " I just do n't think you need me , that 's all , " I said . And there it was , out finally . " But ... but what would I do if ? " " You 're wondering where you would live ? You 'd have your choice ; anybody would want you . " " I know , but things might not be the same , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I was startled at my cruelty , for I had her sitting as straight as a victim of charm school ; I had her swallowing and blinking , and she was pressing her little orchid nails into her knees . And yet there was a satisfaction in this as well , a twinge of perverse pride that I was now the one delivering a bit of uneasiness . " You think those ladies I paint are stupid , do n't you ? " I asked belligerently . " Really stupid . " " Stupid ? No , mama , I  --  I like them . " " Oh , come on ! They 're all the same . You do better yourself . Now be honest with me . " Zephyr suddenly widened her eyes and pushed back her bangs . In a very smooth tone , she said : " I am being honest . " She Wright mean that , I thought . And bending closer to my daughter who had , above all , a need for truth , who had been told nothing but that all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the facts of her father and faced , rather gallantly , the phobias of her mother , I saw that she did mean it . We settled to stare at each other , eyes blue to blue , huddled in Zephyr 's room of tropical fish and dictionaries - and exotic snapshots . Her hand came to my face , and with her thumb she traced my nose , just once , a slash , a very even line . 11111
