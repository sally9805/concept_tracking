Power play with two of the Miami Dolphins ' star backs . y LA Y CSONKA AND JIM KillCK with DAVE ANDERSON I 'm Larry Csonka , in the straight-up type . I 'm Jim Kiick , in the slanty type . That 's perfect for Jim because he is the slanty type . His eyes are always half closed , Like he 's asleep . And he does n't always believe what I tell him . When I do n't , I just say , " Get the hat ! " That 's the way we are . We kid a lot . Of course we have to know when to kid our coach , Don Shula . Winning is a business with him , and he puts business first . Our first training camp with Don Shula opened with a twelve-minute run . We were huffing and puffing through it when Paul Warfield shook his head . " We did n't have to do this in Cleveland , " he said . He had joined us that year in a trade with the Browns for our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mike Phipps , their quarterback now . Even if Phipps develops into the All-Pro quarterback , it was one of the best trades any team ever made . Paul Warfield is one of the all-time great wide receivers . He 's also one of the all-time great guys . He 's tough too . Most fans do n't realize what a good blocker he is . As a wide receiver , he has to come across to throw a crackback block on a linebacker . He really delivers it . In the 1971 season he leveled Dick Butkus with one . Butkus called it one of the hardest shots he 's ever taken . But to be with Paul , he 's not tough at all . He does n't like to argue . It 's just not his style . He 'll give you his feelings on something but if you start to argue with him , he wo n't continue . He 's a very intelligent guy . And he 's like satin . Not only in the way he runs pass patterns but in his whole personality . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does . He 's very unemotional , very quiet . So when he does say something , it means a lot . Like in our play-off game with the Browns last year . We had been the first NFL team to go 14 and 0 during a regular season . But we knew we had to keep winning through the Super Bowl At right : Jim shows how to receive the ball and hang on to it as he gets ready to clamp down on Earl Morrall 's handoff . Opposite page : Larry Csonka , 237 pounds of muscle and bone turned into a battering mm , looks about as easy to stop as a runaway tank . Anybody here thinking about grabbing that football away from him ? or it would n't mean anything . In our first playoff , we were losing to the Browns , 14-13 , with about eight minutes left . Our only touchdown had come when Charley Babb blocked a punt . We had n't been behind in the fourth quarter since the third game of the season when we were losing to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 16-14 ) . Now , against the Browns , we had the ball at our 20 after a kickoff . We were in our huddle , all our eyes flashing behind our face-masks . " All right , " Paul said quietly but firmly . " This is it . We 've got to score now . " Then he went out and got the touchdown almost all by himself . He caught a pass from Earl At left : Eye to eye , nose to nose , a tackler of the Buffalo Bisons and Jim Kiick compose a tableau of football 's ultimate moment  --  irresistible force meets immovable object . Below : Larry heads for a big hole in the enemy line . Dolphins ' Number 88 , Jim Mandich , is busy wiping out would-be tacklers . Jim Kiick , Number 21 , seems to be eyeing the enemy secondary on his blocking assignment downfield . And as for our friend on the far right of the photo , in one second he 'll be seeing the number on Larry 's back . Morrall that got us out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us to the 45 , then Paul made a leaping catch of another pass that got us down to the Browns ' 20 , a great catch . He leaped , juggled the ball , finally got a good grip on it and fell hard underneath Ben Davis , who was covering him . Paul just lay there . I knew he was hurt . I was just wishing he was n't hurt bad . Luckily , he 'd only had the wind knocked out of him . Two plays later , he ran a sideline pattern and one of the Browns ' linebackers , Bill Andrews , shoved him . The interference penalty moved us to the 8 and on the next play , the or Kiicker went in for the touchdown . That 's the way this team is . Paul got us going that time . Beating the Browns meant something special to him . He 'd played for them and he lives in Cleveland in the off-season . But in another situation , it could 've been somebody else who got us going . In a crisis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through together . We do n't have any special leaders . I think everybody in his own way is a leader . I mean while we 're playing . When there 's a team bitch about not enough tickets or something , the guys go to Nick Buoniconti , but that 's different . Nick is a professional 's professional . He 's not one of the drinking , hell-raising types . He 's very efficient . Hell , he 's a lawyer . Nick 's really helped our football team on the field , too . He gave our defensive unit the experienced man it needed . In a game , Nick 's in charge at middle linebacker , just like Bob Griese is in charge at quarterback . Bob was in his second season with the Dolphins when me and Jim got here in 1968 but we 're really only getting to know him now . Like knowing what to expect from him . Or how he 's going to react in a situation . Or what he 's thinking . Until now , I had no idea what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make friends easily or quickly . It 's not that he 's aloof . It 's just that until he knows you , he does n't open up . He keeps a no-man 's land between you and him . He 's changed a little . He goes out of his way more now to kid with a teammate . I think that 's because he 's more secure . When the Dolphins were losing , he was chewed over so many times by the fans and the writers in Miami Continued on page too A city anywhere must start with a purpose . Then people come to work toward that purpose and build houses to house the workers , and thus the city grows . This is the proper way for a city to grow ; otherwise , if one builds a city at sea , you will have merely a bedroom city or a city in search of a purpose . But the multiple uses I 've described here constitute the real purpose of what we might call a sea city . With airports and harbors , hotels for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freight handlers , the airport workers , and harbor workers . Hotels at airports on land have to be insulated from the aircraft noise . What better insulator could there be than seawater with hotel accommodations within the huge floats or pylons beneath the sea surface ? Travelers would truly have an " ocean view " ? from below ! Actual engineering works are going on in some of these directions . Recently we read of the offshore nuclear plant which is to be floated three miles off the Jersey coast . Some of us know of John Craven 's imaginative model of a floating city to be associated with the bicentennial celebrations in Hawaii . And again in Hawaii , Honolulu 's airport is to be multiplied in capacity by extending a runway on a reef offshore , and others are planning a port offshore to serve Texas . These things are going on in our country . But other nations are ahead of us . The Japanese already have great plans for a floating city . European nations around the North Sea are planning  --  some even building  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the North Sea . How can we in the U.S. take a major step and put the whole system together instead of whittling piecemeal and having to solve all the public policy questions and the endless national and international debates over and over again for each step we take seaward ? It is probably not economical for an individual activity by itself  --  for example , oil refining  --  to move out to sea and in the short time scale available meet the urgent energy demands . But , if we join the different uses in a systems concept , moving out to sea is feasible . The total cost of such a sea complex would be less than the sum of the individual costs of the components . But how to do it ? First of all , public policy  --  that is , new policies and new thinking in government , industry and the universities  --  new because we must recognize that the dimensions of the task are very large indeed . The dimensions are so great that government 's initiative must be comparable to former national goals that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But industry 's effort is probably larger than even the largest of our industries would undertake alone . We must recognize that the science and technology we will need and that our universities can contribute is greater than any single university can provide . The size of the engineering and management job requires new crossings , new meetings and new agglomerations in government departments , among industries , and among universities . For government , we know that already there are positive discussions going on in Washington on interagency cooperation in the new uses of the sea so that the Maritime Administration with its harbor problems , the AEC with its nuclear plants , the EPA with its waste disposal and NOAA ( the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ) with its experimental platforms can join with FAA and its airports to plan a synergistic sea system . I wonder , however , whether inter-agency cooperation is sufficient . We will need to jump the barrier that defines the traditional missions of government departments . Government has done this before by establishing for atomic energy the AEC , and for space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clout commensurate with the job to be done . We have a sea agency in NOAA , but if NOAA and its parent department , Commerce , are to embark on this massive program , they too must have the support , clout and muscle commensurate to do the job . This can not be done unless the government sets up , as it did in atomic energy and in space , the sea-use project as a national goal on a time scale that is both realistically long enough to achieve its aims , yet realistically short enough to meet the urgency . Concerning international problems , if we are to move complexes out to sea we get involved with the knotty problems of the international law of the sea . Practical considerations dictated by nature  --  how steeply the seabottom shelves into deep enough water  --  will often involve us in conflict with the arbitrary manmade limits of three , twelve or X miles . Where water is shallow , as in the Gulf of Mexico , we may need to go far out ; where water is deeper , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these problems better by multilateral or bilateral agreements of the states and nations affected with due regard to particular geographical situations , rather than by any blanket international agreements that would tend to presume a geographical sameness of all situations . In industry , the size of the effort necessary to accomplish this task is such that we will need to abandon old or social assumptions of the badness of size , of monopolies , and of cartels . Universities which must supply much of the scientific and technological research for enterprises in the sea will likewise need to integrate the separate pieces that are going on , both under the Sea Grant Program and in related programs in many institutions in the United States . Here we need to give a contract to some institution to bring together , to correlate all the developments in sea use . We do n't need to invent how to do this . We have many examples where national scientific and technological talent is or has been coordinated for special tasks . Jefferson , in 1801 , wrote about the ocean , " Nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to which it is fitted . " How about a Jefferson Center , perhaps , dedicated to the development of these purposes for which the ocean is fitted ? This project viewed in its holistic sense and not in fragmented components is the challenge I see as , more and more , we turn to the sea . Z1 // other way too . Like when the huddle has n't formed , if somebody asks Earl what he 's thinking , he 'll say : " Nothing , nothing . " Even if he had a play in mind , Earl never would mention it until he actually called it in the huddle , like it was unlucky for him to mention it until he actually gave it to you . Earl can be emotional but he 's not a rah-rah guy . We do n't have many rah-rah guys . Norm Evans will come around the locker room be fore a game and shake hands with everybody but he does it quietly , seriously . He says something to everybody but I honestly do n't remember what he says to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got my own thoughts . But what he says is n't as important as understanding what his gesture means  --  to have a good game , good luck , let 's be serious . I always look him in the eye and shake hands with him , that 's the important thing . Norm is like a chaplain . He wrote a book titled , On God 's Squad ; he 's very serious about religion . Several guys on our team are religious . " God Squadders , " we call them . Every team has a few . We 're not putting them down . It 's just that being religious is n't our bag . We 're different . What they do off the field is their business , just like what me and Zonk do off the field is our business . Each person has a right to his own life-style . So I do n't like to knock people who do things different than I do . They are good football players , that 's what 's important on the team . Norm Evans is as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , another God Squadder , is one of the hardest-hitting linebackers around . His nickname is " Captain Crunch . " Tim Foley is very religious and a good cornerback . He really works hard at , his job . I like Tim , he speaks up . At a big meeting last season about tickets , Bob Griese had a plan based on the , more years a player had in the NFL , the more tickets he was entitled to . Tim was opposed to that . He thought each player should have equal ticket rights , no matter how many years he 'd been around . He was in his third year then , so he was fighting for himself . I appreciate that . But I thought back to when I was a rookie and we had John Bra rnlett and Ray Jacobs , guys like that . If a ticket situation had developed then , a young player never would have opened his mouth . If the ghosts of John Bramlett and Ray Jacobs had been in that meeting last season , Tim Foley would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing . On a pro football team , there are all kinds of different people . You 've got forty players , forty-seven counting the taxi squad , and they break up into and the other is white . On the 9 Dolfriendships between two or three guys . It 's like with the black players . No matter how much integration there is , there always will be a difference between blacks and whites for the simple reason that one is black phins , like on every team I 've ever been on , the blacks drift together and the whites drift together because each has something in common , the color of their skin . But on the Dolphins , the important thing is that there are no racial factions . Nobody looks at each other as a black or a white . They look at each other as teammates . That atmosphere has been dictated by two things . One , by winning . Two , by a coach who tries to treat his players equally . Sometimes he does n't , but Don Shula always appears to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I was walking with Shula toward our locker room when Charley Leigh 's wife drove into the parking lot and waved at us . Shula did n't recognize her , so he nudged me . " Whose wife is that ? " he whispered . I told him , and when we got up to where she had parked , he said : " Came to bring Charley 's lunch , eh ? " He said it like he knew her all along , and she smiled . But that 's Shula , and that 's good too . Some coaches would n't have noticed . Shula is thinking all the time . Charley Leigh is black but that 's not why Shula did it . Charley is a running back who does n't get to play much and if I know Shula , he wanted to make Charley 's wife feel that her husband was as important to the coach as anybody else on the team . In the locker room , I told Charley about it and we had a good laugh . Charley 's a quiet giggler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this team , guys are always harassing each other about something , Like last season when Earl Morrall joined us , our equipment man , Dan Dowe , brought in an old maple rocker and put it in front of his locker . The rest of us sit on folding metal chairs but Dan figured that since Earl was thirty-eight years old , he needed something more comfortable . Earl really enjoyed that chair . But every so often just to bug him , somebody would steal it . " I 'm going into the shower , " Earl would announce . " That chair better he back here when I return . " It always was too . Out of respect for the elderly . Earl is so old , he still has a crew cut . Bill Stanfill , one of our defensive ends , always kidded him about that . " Your hair 's getting a little long , Earl , " he would say . " You better get it trimmed . " Bill Stanfill is one of the more quiet guys on the team . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vern really came a long way . When he was a rookie , I did n't think he 'd make the club . But he lifted weights , he got bigger and heavier , he 's really a helluva pass-rusher now . But he gets harassed about his name . He 's always getting mail for Dennis Van Harder or Van Der Herder . Bob Heinz is another quiet guy , and so is Jim Dunaway , they 're defensive tackles . So is Wayne Moore , an offensive tackle . Curtis Johnson , our right cornerback , is quiet too but he 's got a dry sense of humor . If you listen , he 's really funny . Mary Fleming is a helluva dude . When we played the Giants at Yankee Stadium last season , the dirt part of the baseball infield was muddy . Mercury Morris tried to cut in that mud , slipped and fell . Going back to the huddle with him , I said : " Mere , you 're a dumb Hunkey to try to cut in that stuff . " Alongside me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had heard me say . " What 'd you call him ? " he asked . " A dumb Hunkey , " .1 said , like there was nothing worse than a dumb Hunkey , a dumb Hungarian . Mary really laughed about that . Mary takes a lot of harassment about spending money . Actually , about not spending any money . But he 's got a reason . When he was growing up out near Los Angeles , his father disappeared , leaving his mother and six sons . As the oldest , he 's been the working head of the family ever since . He 's always thinking of how to make some money . Like in the end zone at Buffalo last season . He caught a pass for a touchdown and I was alongside him . I told him , " Helluva play , Marv , " and as I put myhand on his shoulder , I happened to look down . Laying there on the grass in the end zone was a $10 bill , a little bit wrinkled but spread out , just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at it and said , " Marv , look , " and as I did , he put one of his big shoes on it , reached down and grabbed it . " Do n't I get half ? " I asked him . " No way , Zonk , " he said . " No way . " That 's the difference between me and Marv . I saw the $10 bill . and pointed at it . He grabbed it . He 's a real money player too . He 's been on three Super Bowl winners , two with the Packers , one with us . When he 's asked which team would win if those Packers played our Dolphins , he says : " Whichever one I 'm on . " That 's pride . That 's what football is . That 's what football players have to have if they 're going to win . It ' s a clich ? , but it 's true . Man , was one of the first players Shula got , after he took over as coach . Mary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got him in a trade for Jack Clancy , a wide receiver . On our jet charters , Mary sits in the first-class section with Bob Griese , Larry Little , Nick Buoniconti , Paul Warfield , me and Jim , and last season Earl Morrall sat in first class too . Our first two years , when George Wilson was the coach , all the players sat in the tourist section . But when Shula took over , he moved a few of us up front . It 's an honor . But to me , the most important thing is that the seats are bigger . Mary Fleming is a tight end but he 's much more than a pass-receiver . He 's an even better Mocker . With our running game , that 's important . He can block a linebacker . He takes great pride in that . Of all the guys on our team , I think Larry Little has the most pride . He 's the best guard in the NFL but in 1967 , he was n't even drafted . He signed with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was ordered to report to training camp a week before the drafted rookies were to report . " That really got to my pride , " he once told me . " Hell , they were rookies just like rne , Why should I be a week earlier than them ? " That 's what 1 mean about Larry 's pride . You can hurt his feelings easily . He 's a very soft-spoken easy-going guy . 1 make sure I really communicate with him as much as I can . He grew up in Miami and when he was with the Chargers , one day I met him by chance in an auto-body shop in Miami during the off-season . At the time he was hardly playing with the Chargers but 1 had the feeling that this was one guy 1 was going to get to know . Get the hat ! No kidding . I really had that feeling . I even asked him if he 'd like to play for the Dolphins so he could be home all year round , but he hemmed and hawed about that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't doing bad then , and the Dolphins could hardly win a game . But he lived here . I told him : " ill see if I can get the Dolphins to trade for you . " I was half-kidding , but I did mention it to Joe Thomas , who told me that he already was working on a deal for Larry . We got him a few months later and at training camp , he told me : " You said you 'd do it , Zonk , but I did n't believe you . " Get the hat , Zonk , you had nothing to do with the deal . Maybe not , but I 'm glad it went through . Anytime that Larry Little is out in front of me on a sweep , the cornerback coming up to try to make the tackle looks like he wished he were watching it on TV somewhere . When they see Larry coming , those cornerbacks have alarm in their eyes . Larry loves to chop them down . But the essence of our team is that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a black guy about being black . And there is n't a black guy who 's afraid to kid a white guy about being white . That happens all the time . Like before the Super Bowl game last season , there was a newspaper article about how the Redskins had put up on their bulletin board another newspaper article . In it , Lloyd Mumphord , who was going to start at left cornerback because Tim Foley had a shoulder separation , had been quoted as not being worried that Billy Kilmer would test him with a few passes . " Lloyd , " said Doug Crusan , " it says you 're their ' Pinup Boy . ' At least they capitalized the B in Boy . " ' Lloyd laughed . So did everybody else . Another time one of our assistant coaches , Carl Taseff , was giving us a scouting report on a team . " They 've got a new boy at linebacker , " Taseff said . The new linebacker happened to be black . Ilubie Ginn , one of our running backs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Taseff and shook his head . Some of the other black players kidded Taseff about it later . Ever since , he 's always made it a point to say " man " or " player , " not " boy . " The black players were n't uptight about it because they knew Taseff had n't meant anything by it . Our team has never been split over a white player getting a job over a black player , or a black player getting a job over a white player . Shula comes on with the honesty thing so hard all the time , everybody accepts it . " It 's not who you are or what you look like , " Shula keeps saying . " It 's how you perform . " I 've only had one bad situation with another player the whole time I 've been on the Dolphins , and he happened to be black . Jimmy Hines was the other player . But it was n't because he was black . Jimmy Hines was a sprinter from Texas Southern who won the 100-meter dash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't adapt his speed to football . They tried to make a wide receiver out of him . But when he made a cut , he had to come to almost a complete stop to do it . After a couple seasons , he got cut . He could n't catch the ball . His nickname was " Ooops . " One time coming back on a plane , he got a little drunk . He was standing in the aisle , talking about how he was going to be the first black President of the United States . " Hines , " I said , " they could paint you green , and you still would n't be smart enough to be anybody 's President of anything . " I do n't believe he ever spoke to me after that . But him being black had nothing to do with what I told him . Hell , he could 've been polka dot . It 's like socializing with teammates , I just do n't socialize with hardly anybody on the team except for Jim and once in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live up in Plantation , behind Fort Lauderdale , and not many guys live up that way . Second , I prefer to socialize mostly with people who are n't in football . I believe that when too many players are close off the field , they get to know too much about each other . It can make for a bad situation . They can start to get negative about each other . Even worse is when the players ' wives make a big society thing out of football . I really resent that . Coming from Stow , Ohio , I resent any kind of fancy society atmosphere , Because where I grew up , everybody was just everybody . There you kidded each other without ever being pointy about it . When you get the wives together , social climbing is prevalent . Some wives are more concerned with social status than in simple friendship with other players ' wives . I 'm not saying all of them , but a small faction is always present . And women , I believe , because they ca n't punch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acute in that kind of atmosphere than men are . Particularly men who are football players , simply because these men have a great deal of respect for each other . We 're not afraid to knock the hell out of each other on the field so we tend to respect each other 's feelings off the field . But the chicks are n't going to get into any knockdown , drag-out fight , so they pull petty stuff . Sooner or later your wife is going to come home and say , " Do you know what she said to me . " Now you 've got trouble relating to your teammate because you know that the other wife went home bitching to her husband about your wife . Ball players can live together . But you put the families together , you 've got yourself a problem . It 's not good for players to live too close together . I found that out my rookie year . Six of us lived either in the Villa Apartments or nearby over on Miami Beach  --  myself , John Bramlett , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Twilley . We drove to practice at Miami Stadium every day in Dick 's car . Afterwards , most of us liked to stop for a drink but Dick did n't . He 'd drop us off and then go home . But the trouble was , he 'd get home in time for dinner and we would n't . When we finally did get home , our wives all had the same question as we walked in the door : " How come Dick got home for dinner and you 're just coming home now ? " Little things like that create friction . But the problem was that we lived so close together . All the wives knew what was going on . Whenever Dick was late he was probably out hustling a business deal . He 's always wheeling . The way he 's going , Dick Anderson probably will be a millionaire someday . No probably to it . He wo n't give up until he is . I do n't have much in common with Dick because I 'm not that dedicated to business . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ athlete and a nice guy He gets along great with the guys on the team . He works as hard at football as he does at business . He 'll come up with a big play just when we need it . Like the AFC championship game against the Colts when he ran back an interception 62 yards for a touchdown , the one where he got six great blocks . That was one of the greatest plays I 've ever seen . I can close my eyes and see all those blocks unfolding . But he knew how to follow those blocks . Against the Giants last season , we were leading , 20-13 , in the last quarter but we had to punt . Larry Seiple was hurt , so Dick was our punter . He got off a bad one but it bounced off a Giant helmet and we recovered . Good or bad , he 'll make a big play . There are only five of us on the Dolphins now who were rookies together  --  me and Zonk and Doug Crusan on offense . Manny Fernandez @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty good five . Doug Crusan is one of the NFL 's best offensive tackles . On the field , he 's all business . But off it , he 's the team clown . Like when we 're watching films , everybody falls asleep at one time or another . But before the lights go out , Doug will take a big spray can and spray the meeting room . " The Anti-Z Monster Spray , " he calls it . The Z-Monster , of course , is what puts you to sleep . Watching films , even Shula gets sleepy sometimes . He does n't actually fall asleep . But when he gets sleepy , he stands up and shuffles around to stay awake . You know he 's as sleepy as everybody else , but he 's the coach so he can get up and make it look like he 's thinking . During the films once , Shula caught me . " Wake up , wake up , " he said and nudged me . But the coaches make us watch films at a bad time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nap then . When the lights go off , the Z-Monster always gets me . When the lights go on and we 're walking out , Doug Crusan will look around . " Who did the Z-Monster get today ? " he'llsay , Doug loves to make people laugh . One time at training camp when George Wilson was the coach , a girl society reporter visited us to write about the " animals " who play football . She was sitting at George 's table at lunch when she burst out laughing . For dessert that day , we had Jell-o with whipped cream . Crusan had scooped up the whipped cream from about six Jell-os and plopped it all over his face . Doug really had that girl reporter laughing . That 's why he did it . His lifelong ambition is to be one of the clowns on a kiddie show on television . His idols are the Banana Splits , the TV cartoon comedians . He 'll sit in his room at training camp , watch-Continued on page 108 continued from page 104 ing the Banana Splits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 6-6 , 260 , a huge body but a tiny head . That 's why the guys call him Bluto , after the character in the Popeye cartoon . Doug made that girl reporter realize that football players are n't " animals " at all . He ruined her story . All that talk about football players being " animals " is strictly bull . Some players might use it as a joke , to fool people on the outer edges of football or the general public . But they never fool another jock . Football players are like everybody else . They 're flesh and bone . You ca n't come on like a dragon all the time . Some people who are n't football players act more like " animals " to me . Like politicians . Most players are as professional in their job as doctors or lawyers , like Manny Fernandez , our big defensive tackle who did such a great job stopping Larry Brown when we won the Super Bowl game . The year we were rookies , Manny had n't even been drafted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because the Dolphins thought that with his name he 'd sell tickets to the Cuban population . " I 'm sorry , " he said after he 'd signed . " I ca n't speak Spanish . " He had been a good college player but nothing special . I think he was just cut out to be a pro . He does n't go for the rah-rah that some college coaches demand . Just put him in the defensive line , tell him to kill the quarterback or stop a running back , and he 'll do it . He knows what he 's doing out there . He 's a very bright guy , the professional type . He 's in complete control of himself . He 's a complete professional . Jake Scott , our other safetyman with Dick Anderson , is a born gambler . He likes to take chances . He likes to chase girls too . Him and our alternate tight end , Jim Mandich , all they do is chase girls . But why the hell not , they 're single . On a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guys . Some guys even take practice seriously , like Bob Matheson , one of our linebackers . Anytime that Shula hollers at him in practice , he goes crazy for the next five plays . Bob clocked me once last season in practice . ( " Clocked " means hit very hard . ) He does n't do it on purpose . He just gets carried away . We 've got some freaky guys too . Another linebacker , Doug Swift , is a new movement type . In the front yard of his house , he put in a little nature-like pool with a plant growing out of a stone formation . He 's got a big weimaraner that he drapes over his shoulders and carries around . He likes music . He has a big pair of earphones with mikes of cord tangled around everything in the house . He 's a freethinker . Doug 's our player representative , but Howard Twilley is always arguing with him about something . Howard is a tough little guy . He 's small and not that fast but he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on unions , any unions , including the NFL Players Association , and he 's always threatening not to pay his dues . He always says what he thinks , which is good . And he 's always complaining about something to Doug Swift , no matter what the subject is . Whenever it looks like some issue is going to be a solid 100 percent vote , Howard 's face changes . He 's thinking that not everybody has given enough thought to it , so he 'll disagree . Just to get an argument going . He 's also concerned with governmental policy , with the big issues . That 's unusual in the locker room . Most guys are aware of what 's going on in the world . But in the locker room , they fool around . Me , Bob Kuechenberg , Jim Langer and Larry Seiple have a standing battle of pulled ears , snapping each other with towels . Seiple is our punter , a very competitive guy . In the AFC championship game with the Pittsburgh Steelers last season , he set up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yards to their 12-yard line . Shula always says that Seiple has the right to run instead of punt , as long as he makes a first down . Kuech keeps me laughing with his stories about his dad who was a human cannonball in the circus . One day his dad was sick , so his uncle substituted . But his uncle 's weight was different than his dad 's . Nobody compensated for it in the powder charge . When his uncle got shot out of the cannon , he missed the net and hit the ferric wheel . His uncle really got banged up , so Kuech became a guard instead of a human cannonball . Kuech and Jim Linger , our center , always bring their lunches to practice on Thursday , to eat after the weekly weigh-in . Everybody starves down on Wednesday and Thursday morning to make their weight . Shula knows what he wants you to weigh for the game so he sets the Thursday weight at about two pounds under it , figuring that by Sunday you 'll have put on two pounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've got to sacrifice . That 's part of Shula 's religious theme . You 've got to sacrifice to win . Evidently it 's working . Anyway , when Kuech and Jim bring their sandwiches in , I tell them : " Taxes , time for taxes . I 'm a running back . I 've got to tax my linemen . " I 'll take a bite . They do the same thing to me , only they try to take the whole thing . I 've got to wrestle them to get my sandwich back . But nobody ever gets mad about it . We 're just fooling around . It 's guys like this who make a championship team . Great guys . Quiet . Friendly . You can hardly provoke them . But on the football field , they 're as aggressive as hell . 2
