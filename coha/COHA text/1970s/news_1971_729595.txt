txt In 1922 Truman Newberry ( R ) of Michigan resigned from the Senate when it was disclosed he had spent a scandalous $195,000 for election . In indignation , Congress passed the 1925 Corrupt Practices Act limiting campaign expenditures to $25,000 for a Senator and $3 million for a national campaign committee . The law was a joke . Nobody has ever been prosecuted under it . " It is more loophole than law , " exclaimed President Johnson . In 1968 , Democrats spent about $12.9 million for Hubert H. Humphrey ( borrowing heavily ) and Republicans $24 million for Richard M. Nixon ( largest amount on record , all paid in advance ) . Now the Senate has just passed , 88 to 2 , a new election finance reform measure , the " dime a voter " bill . // *Dime-a-voter campaign bill : will it work in U.S. ? // Russell Hemenway of the National Committee for an Effective Congress calls it " a stunning reform victory " and the New York Times hails it editorially as " a masterly job . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The new Senate bill must pass a couple of hurdles , it must get by the House , which has its own ideas , then it must win White House approval ( President Nixon vetoed an earlier bill saying it was n't comprehensive cnough ) After that it must be tested to see if it holds water , the 1925 act leaked like a sieve For example , it limited a national committee to " $3 million " but did not limit the number of committees In a recent election the GOP had 18 , the Democrats 32 . Every four years since then critics have charged that rich men buy elections . An accumulating body of left-wing literature ( newest example " The Sick Society , " Michael Tanzer , $5 95 , Holt , Rinehart , Winston ) argues that in a nation where the 100 largest industrial concerns control half the nation 's manufacturing assets it is only natural that corporate political power should spread , directly or indirectly . Back in 1896 Standard Oil donated $250 , - 000 to defeat populist William Jennings Bryan . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A. Rockefeller 's family ptit up between $4 and $5 million Richard L. Ottinger , Democratic Senate candidate in New York , spent $1.8 million of family money in the primary and general election , but lost Big spending by the Kennedy and other families has raised the question whether politics is only for the rich House fate uncertain Now the Senate bill , the most compiebensive election-spending reform act in 45 years , faces an uncertain fate in the House Under it , a candidate for federal office could spend no more for political advertising than a dime pet eligibly voter in his - district , of state or , in the case of presidential candidates , the nation . Of the 10 cents , no more than 6 could go to any media . In practical terms this means limiting TV-radio appeals ( the most effective politically ) to 6 cents Direct mail is exempt . In 1968 , there were 82 million registered voters and under the bill each party could have spent about $8.2 million The 6 percent rule would have limited TV-radio expenditures to about $5 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Humphrey about half that . In 1972 voting-age population is expected to be 140 million ( with 18-year-olds ) so broadcasts would be limited to $8.4 million Republicans , who normally have more money , would find their fiscal advantage somewhat reduced , but the vote in the Senate was generally nonpartisan . Other provisions listed Other features of the bill- It tepeals the equal broadcast time for federal elections . It establishes a new 6-man federal elections commission to administer the reporting and disclosure requirements . It greatly strengthens i eports to the public on how much a candidate spends , but does not limit the amount of expenditures or contributions It applies the dime-a-voter rule to primary campaigns . A provision ( likely to be knocked out in - conference ) limits what a candidate pockets Thefamily can spend from their own The House may challenge the Senate proposal to drop - equal- time requirements . Senators want to free stations from quacks and nuisance candidates ; House members fear broadcasters would discrirmnate and not , in fact , give equal treatment .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
