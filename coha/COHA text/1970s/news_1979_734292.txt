txt " The infested areas are not too hard to avoid , " a shipping executive said . " All we have to do is to steer a bit further off the coast of Vietnam . " That could add 200 miles to a ship 's voyage , " he said , " but it is also a lot cheaper than stopping to pick up refugees . On the whole we do n't feel that they deserve our.help ; they are never grateful in the way that we expect . " The elderly man was having a snack in the managing directors ' executive dining room at one b the largest industrial groups in the world . Outside the head offices of the Mitsubishi group were lined up in rows along the boulevard . About 2,000 miles away in the South China Sea , ships bound for Japan , some Japanese-owned , some on charter , some European , are giving a wide berth to what the Japanese executive called " the infested areas . " As more " boat people " have poured out of Vietnam this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Japan , recent United Nations figures show . Japan has quintupled aid to the United Nations refugee office this year . It will contribute $52.5 million under a decision announced this month by Foreign Minister Sunao Sonoda . But so far , Japan has allowed only three refugees to settle here out of more than 2,200 brought here ships passing through the South China Sea . Immigration Policies Strict " We really can not do much more , " a Foreign Ministry spokesman said . " Our territory is just too small and our customs so different from those of the Vietnamese . " Hitoshi Mise , a staff member in the Tokyo office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees , showed a visitor a list of ships that brought Vietnamese refugees to Japan since the end of the Vietnam War in 1975 . The main task of the United Nations organization in Japan , he said , is to relocate boat people arriving here in countries willing to accept them as permanent residents ? the United States , France and Scandinavian countries . The list showed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policies are severe , peaked in 1977 and declined sharply since then . The decline is largely explained by a rapid fall in the number of Japanese vessels stopping to pick up the refugees . " There 's been a marked reduction , " said the United Nations officer . " You can see that from the chart . " In 1977 , 21 of the 26 ships that brought refugees here were Japanese flag vessels . But last year the total dropped to 7 out of 21 . And so far this year , only 4 Japanese ships brought back refugees out of a total of 13 such ships arriving in Japan . Mr. Mise declined to speculate on the reasons for the decline . " The number of boat people leaving Vietnam , rose about tenfold this spring , " he said , " but the trend is for a smaller absolute number to come to Japan . " Japanese ships brought 726 refugees here in 1977 but only 50 so far this year . " Last month 71,877 people sought refuge in Southeast Asia and liclg Kong . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Japan is by hitching a ride on a Japanesebound ship , one of the many hundreds of vessels that traverse the South China Sea every month , The greatest number of these belong to Japanese shipping lines , which dominate the busy sea routes from the Far East to Europe . Refugees say that such vessels rarely stop . The owners say that they always come to the rescue of a ship in distress . " It 's an iron rule of the sea , " said Yoshiya Ariyoshi , former chairman of Nippon Yusen Kaisha , one of the largest shipping lines in the world . " All our captains are under instructions to help a ship that 's going under , anywhere in the world . " A first officer of a Japanese tanker that sails regularly through the South China Sea said , however , that his ship had gone back and forth off Vietnam for two years . but never encountered a small boat . " I hear that two of our company 's ships were chased by refugee boats but they fled , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his company 's . Do Not Want to Help ' " I personally do not want to help the boat people , " he said . " Discrimination in Japan may be the most fierce in the world . I do not think they can live in this country . And our nation has made no preparations to receive Vietnamese refugees . " The seaman smiled when asked if his company had given orders not to pick up boat people . " No , there has been absolutely no such order , " he said , " but it 's possible that our skippers have been quietly told ? or encouraged ? not to actively take the inititative to rescue boat people . " " I know this may sound weak , " he said , " but the problem is too heavy a one for private shipping firms alone . Are we supposed to set aside our tight sailing schedules ? Our supreme obligation is to follow our schedule ? from one harbor to another . Even if I were a. captain and found these small boats offshore from Vietnam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flee . We would rescue any that were sinking or were wrecked ? but that 's quite another matter from ships that are moving under their own power , their engines in order . " " The whole affair is political , " he said , " and I personally do n't like to be mixed up in politics . If the Government gives us instructions , that 's another matter , but still there would be a limit . We 'll never change our route to pass close off the Vietnam coast . " Tuna Ship Is Boarded The reluctance of Japanese ships to pick up refugees stems from incidents such as the boarding of the Tetsu Mani , a 100-ton tuna fishing ship , in April last year . " The Tetsu Maru had its generator down , " said Mr. Mise , " and they were drifting under repair and the crew was asleep below deck . Then all of a sudden they became aware that they had been boarded ? by 57 people . The captain tried to persuade them to go back on their own craft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and children set up a wailing , and he relented and took them into Kagosima . " " Later the captain visited us and complained that his ship had been hijacked , " said Mr. Mise with a weak smile . " They lost a lot of money since they could not fish with all those extra people aboard . " The Japanese authorities did not offer residence rights to this boarding party , all of whom settled in the United States with the United Nations refugee office acting as intermediary . " It 's not clear that the Japanese immigration authorities give a great welcome to people like this , " said Mr. Mise . Well Away From Trouble An unknown number of boat people starve at sea , or drown or die of sickness or dehydration . The picture given in talks with shipowners and seamen is not that the Japanese crews avert their eyes as they pass by at sea , leaving the sufferers in distress . Instead , they stay well away from trouble by navigating , as far as possible , through empty waters . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people are just not our responsibility , " said a shipping line executive . " We greatly resent any attempt by others ? including Western powers ? to pin any part of this confusion on us. "
