A President pleading once again for more U.S. military aid to Southeast Asia . Antiwar underground radicals igniting a bomb at the State Department , hiding another in a federal building in Oakland . Peace marchers rallying in Washington , exhorted by Congresswoman Bella Abzug , Congressman-Priest Robert Drinan , Folk Singers Joan Baez and Pete Seeger . Demonstrators occupying the Minneapolis and Washington offices of Hubert Humphrey , temporarily seizing the South Vietnamese consulate in San Francisco . Senator Strom Thurmond bellowing through a bullhorn in support of the Saigon regime . <P> More Money . A nostalgic flashback to the nation 's Viet Nam War agonies of the late ' 60s ? Not at all . The familiar scenes were actually enacted last week , two years after the Paris peace agreement was supposed to have stopped the fighting in Viet Nam . This time the call for more military money to help anti-Communist forces in both Viet Nam and Cambodia came from President Gerald Ford . In a coordinated drive , Secretary of State Henry Kissinger , Vice President Nelson Rockefeller and Secretary of Defense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nam 's President Nguyen Van Thieu suddenly submitted to interviews with a dozen newsmen . The net impression was that the nation was once again caught up in a divisive war debate . <P> Conceivably that could yet become the case , especially if South Viet Nam 's military forces were about to collapse and President Ford were to propose any kind of U.S. air or naval rescue effort . But at the moment the rhetoric , and even the tired bombing and sit-in tactics , were misleading . The U.S. public , worried about unemployment , recession , inflation and energy , clearly was in no mood for a renewed argument over Southeast Asia . A question among Washington politicians was why the Ford Administration , fighting on so many fronts , was risking a new confrontation over the lingering war . <P> Ford 's explanation in a message to Congress was that the U.S. , to protect its own " national security , " should give South Viet Nam a supplemental appropriation of $300 million and the anti-Communist government of Cambodia 's Lon Nol $222 million . Said Ford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embattled countries . U.S. unwillingness to provide adequate assistance to allies fighting for their lives would seriously affect our credibility throughout the world . " All that was being sought for Saigon , Kissinger said , was for Congress to provide the funds that it had authorized for the current fiscal year but had failed to appropriate fully . ( Actually , in its two-stage funding process , it is commonplace for Congress to authorize more money than it finally appropriates . ) <P> Whole World . Speaking in his Saigon palace to TIME Correspondent Peter Range , Thieu put the issue more starkly . " Do the American people like the sacrifice of 50,000 American boys to be in vain ? How can you imagine coming here just to run and abandon the men who continue your ideals ? " If the U.S. abandons Viet Nam , as the French did in 1954 , Thieu insisted apocalyptically , " all Viet Nam will be a Communist country . All Indochina . All Southeast Asia . The whole world .
