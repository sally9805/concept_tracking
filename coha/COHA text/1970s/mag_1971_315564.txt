Deep End is being advertised as if it were a sequel to Repulsion . But instead of ghoulish psychodrama , it offers canny black comedy . Executed with a surrealistic flourish by Polish Director Jerzy Skolimowski ( who collaborated with Roman Polanski on the script of Knife in the Water ) , it transforms the rite of puberty into a frenzied and often wildly funny vaudeville . <P> Mike ( John Moulder-Brown ) is a teen-age fumbler who takes his first job as an attendant at a public bath and swimming pool located in the far reaches of some bleak London suburb . He is engulfed by sexual fantasies but terrified when any of his female customers attempt to initiate him . Little wonder . Women for him are a mystery and a threat . They either overwhelm him with bloated lust ( like one patron who smothers him in a bone-crushing embrace while passionately discussing football ) or exploit him , like Susan ( Jane Asher ) , another attendant at the baths , whose simultaneous taunting and flirting Mike finds irresistible . <P> Backgrounds with Imagery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a date to the cinema and caressing her while her fiance searches for the manager . He ruins one of her rendezvous in the bathhouse cabin by ringing the fire alarm . Susan only teases him more . Mike finally manages to provoke her so severely that she slaps him across the mouth , loosening the diamond of her engagement ring . Seeing a chance to redeem himself , Mike works out an incredibly elaborate scheme for recovering the jewel . <P> Skolimowski fills his backgrounds with imagery ( a painter covering a wall in red , a man in the swimming pool rolling over and over in a kayak ) that is both disorienting and quite funny . Mike is clearly descended from the manic protagonists embodied by Jean-Pierre Leaud in Godard 's films and in Skolimowski 's Le Dpart . They all suffer their youth as if it were a wound . <P> Yet there is also about Deep End , as in Skolimowski 's other work , a kind of viciousness directed toward his characters that prevents his films from being fully successful . Skolimowski is interested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Susan 's sadism are largely unmotivated , so that as characters they are little more than puppets in a savage Punch and Judy . The film 's last scene , which is a frightening realization of one of Mike 's most deranged dreams , should properly be shocking and pitiful . But it is singularly unsuccessful , despite the talents of John Moulder-Brown and Jane Asher , who are engaging enough to bring at least a small measure of humanity to a film that is otherwise frozen in its own misanthropy . <P> Jay Cocks
