Television news is often accused of turning a bland eye on controversy , and activist critics yearn for the days when the late Edward R. Murrow savaged Joseph McCarthy and crusaded for migrant farm workers . No such criticism could be lodged against the NBC documentary What Price Health . Broadcast last December , the program attacked the high cost of medical care in the U.S. , portrayed individual victims of the system in dramatic terms , and lobbied for adoption of a broad national health-insurance scheme . <P> NBC 's show was so tough that it gave the American Medical Association a severe case of outrage . Persuaded that NBC was guilty of numerous specific errors and general distortion , the A.M.A. battled for eight months to gain satisfaction . But only after the A.M.A. took its case to the Federal Communications Commission did NBC yield some ground . Now the A.M.A. and NBC have reached a fuzzy compromise that leaves unsettled the issue of redress in such controversies . <P> The fight began on Jan. 10 , when A.M.A. Executive Vice President Ernest B. Howard sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attacked what he called the program 's " frequent inaccuracy and overall bias , " pointing out 29 instances in which NBC had , by the A.M.A. 's standards , distorted the truth . Howard demanded equal air time for an A.M.A. rebuttal . <P> Instead , Howard received from NBC on Feb. 27 a 39-page rebuttal of the A.M.A. allegations . Two months later , the A.M.A. countered the counterattack and formally asked the FCC to investigate what it termed the " distortion and slanting of news " in the NBC documentary . For its counsel , the A.M.A. hired former FCC Chairman Newton Minow , who once condemned commercial network programming as a " vast wasteland . " The A.M.A. also discussed the case with the new National News Council , an independent body established to adjudicate complaints against news organizations . <P> A number of the A.M.A. 's specific charges about the show were petty , but others were significant . One of the show 's human-interest vignettes , for instance , concerned Kristen Knapp , 5 , whose congenital heart condition received prominent treatment in the documentary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be cause her father-laid off his job two years earlier-could not afford it . <P> Nonsense , the A.M.A. declared . <P> Kristen had received heart surgery at a Cleveland hospital five weeks before the broadcast . Further , the A.M.A. said , the girl had always been eligible for free medical attention through Ohio 's crippled children program . NBC 's rather lame response : the Knapps had not been made aware of the benefits available to their daughter at the time the documentary was filmed , and NBC had been unable to reach the family for an updated report on Kristen before broadcast time . <P> The Knapp family remembers things differently . Gregory Knapp , the father , says that NBC was in touch with him and was told of the operation .
