txt There is a man from Maine who shaves everyday while taking a shower ? and in the process never gets less than 15 shaves out of a blade . It 's a performance that interests the experts . They wonder if its 's the running water that does the trick or if the man 's shaving style also has something to do with the extraordinary blade mileage . To John Clements , whose job it is to evaluate the results of some 10,000 daily experimental ' shaves undertaken in various parts of the world , beard preparation and style are both important . - In fact , no two men shave alike , he says . To the expert , a man 's shaving style is as good as a thumb-print identification . At the very least , his style is as individual to him as his signature . A speedy one Mike , for instance , shaves at a rapid clip every day . A dash of water , a hasty daub of lather , and in short flashing strokes the razor flies across cheek and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little more than 60 seconds . On the other hand , shaving is almost a ritual with Phil . He prepares his beard thoroughly before ever the razor comes into play . Then he removes yesterday 's growth in two basic strokes . The contrast in styles is extreme : Mike 's is tough on blades . Phil , on the other hand , ? gets the sort of mileage out of his which the blade manufacturing industry probably would n't want emulated on too broad a scale . Even so , there is some common ground for all shaving styles , and the Gillette Company , which began the safety shaving bit exactly 70 years ago , has explored this in a booklet titled : " Wet shaving for good grooming. , , ? Preparation of the beard , it seems , is most important . Ever been shaved by a barber ? He 'll take 20 minutes over the task and the bulk of that time will be taken in a hot-towel treatment , in lathering up , and massaging the soap into the face . After that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you an adequate shave . The fact is , beard hair is as hard and tough on blades as copper wire of comparable thickness . Just wetting the beard reduces its resistance to the blade by 50 percent , says Mr. Clements . If you can leave the lather on for a full two minutes the hair will expand by 34 percent , at which stage the once wire-tough whisker will more closely resemble a sap-soft reed . Incidentally , the lather is there solely to keep the beard wet . Water on its own evaporates far too quickly . Industry studies show that the average man gets shaves out of the old-fashioned thin blades and blue blades ; the newer platinum-coated stainless steel blades give about 9% shaves . But an average in this sort of thing is totally misleading . There are the ultra-fastidious who will never use a blade more than once . Then there is such as the gentleman who shaves in ths shower , and another who claims to have shaved exactly  --  one year with a single blade . Yet another wrote a manufacturer saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company . " I 've used the same blade for four months , " he said " You can not possibly make a profit . " Grooming spells profit All this makes it hard to calculate the cost of an average shave . Then , too , personal grooming goes so much beyond mere shaving today . When the final 1972 tally is in , American men will probably have spent a record $1.41 billion on personal grooming ' products , says William G. Salatich of Gillette Noxih America . That is $135 million up on the previous year . The best of today 's razors sell for less than $3 ; 50 years ago you parted with $5 for the cheapest , and if you had that sort of money you could shell  - -  out $75 for one-thickly coated in 14f karat gold . The idea now , , it seems , is to get the razors onto the market and concentrate on the business of selling blades ? in the U.S ? close to $300 million worth a year . Meanwhile , wet shaving remains the preferred way to ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who shave daily , 51 million prefer the lather-and-scrape approach . The ratio is even higher among women : 38 million out of a regular 50 million shavers.
