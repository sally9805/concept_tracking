txt . THE WAR ended a year and 10 days ago , but Nguyen Cao Ky is still fighting . The former South Vietnamese prime minister and vice president speaks from just about any forum willing to pay his $2,000 lecture fee : And today he 's publishing a book , " Twenty Years and Twenty Days , " in which he , provides still more insights and information on-his own role In the conflict , Ky ? who lives in the Washington suburb of Fairfax , Va. , and still likes people to address-him as " marshal " ? summarized his thoughts on both the . war and the peace , Viet Nam ' and the friend ? he say what were'ro doing now in traffic in piasters the local currency , buying them in Da Nang and selling them in Saigon . So nothing drastic has happened yet . Q ? So what about the future ? Will life go on as before ? A ? The honeymoon is finished . We will see more strong measures from now on . You see a few names @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They will disappear . They will be eliminated quietly . Q ? Why the shift of correspondents and diplomats to Hanoi ? What does It mean in terms of Saigon 's future ? A ? It is to make clear that Hanoi now is the capital of all Viet Nam . They the Nbrth Vietnamese expect strong opposition reaction from the southern Communists ; so without the foreign press in Saigon , who will be able to report it ? If there is opposition , no one will know . Q -- Turning to the United States , how do you like it here after a year in the country ? A ? I still prefer the poorest , dusty Saigon ? my home , my farm in the jungle . Still life here is a happy surprise . I make $80,000 or $70,000 since coming to the United States from lectures and from my book . Q ? Ilow do you like this new kind of career ? A ? It 's not a new career for me ? it 's just temporary , but I like the tour of American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know more about the American people . Q ? And what do you think of the United States and the people here ? A ? As a country it 's difficult , to find anything more beautiful . It 's so big , and there is such diversity . The American people are open , frank , very kind . Most of you are very emotional , sentimental people . Q ? Do you always take such a charitable view  --  or do you also see another side of the American character on the basis of what you saw of Americans in Viet Nam ? A ? There are two kinds of American people . We have had experience with American businessmen , those who try to extract money . You meet with them everywhere , the students , the young generation . In the war , particularly in the last few years , you have the feeling the American people are for drugs , pot , and they are lazy , but here you speak with them , you realize those people exist as just a minority while others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really happened . Q ? How do you think Americims really feel about what happened in Viet Nam ? A ? Most Americans after the fall , their attitude was forget about it . There was some sort of relief , but deep inside they felt a little guilty . It is true that their conscience was not happy , and some sentiment of guilt still exists , and now what happened in Angola , in foreign policy again becomes a main issue . The role and position of America today is still what the ' American people worry about the most . Q ? Do you perceive some deep weakness about this country  --  was American withdrawal from Viet Nam a symptom of that weakness ? A ? That kind of weakness happened because of Watergate , but now Watergate , like the fall of Saigon , is past already . So now the normal reaction of a majority of Americans is what are you going to do . You can not stay isolated in the world . Q ? Do you think the United States will establish relations with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American foreign policy ? A ? Some day North Viet Nam , if they are in trouble , they will call on America for the rescue . We are speaking of the next 5 or 10 years . I think that Americans must pay more attention to the Chinese . They must make good with China rather than with Russia . The Russians always have been a colonial power , but not the Chinese . They have too many internal problems ? so today . They have also their own imperial problems . So the most dangerous enemy to the United States are not the Chinese but the Russians . To some that danger becomes obvious . China is America 's only ally it can count on . Q ? What do you think was more responsible for the fall of the old Saigon regime  --  American ' betrayal ' or some weakness in your own government ? A ? The ineffectiveness of our own leaders , of our own officials . It was very true that termination of American aid was an important factor , but still as a Vietnamese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a good philosophy . Q ? To what extent was corruption a factor in the final events ? A ? You have corruption in the most advanced society , but still it is prosperous . You can be corrupt and effective , but what 's wrong with Mr. Thieu South Viet Nam 's last president , Nguyen Van Thieu is he 's not capable to get the popular support in the kind of war we are facing . Military strength alone can not bring victory . It must be combined with social reform . Because of corruption , Thieu could not carry out social reform . The people lost confidence , Q. ? What about Cambodia  --  what 's happening there and why do the Khmer Rouge seem so much tougher than the Vietnamese Communists ? A ? They kill scientists and technicians even . They ar in trouble . Either the Chinese or North Vietnamese will take them over . For a thousand years Vietnamese and Cambodians are different . The Cambodians smile , and then they get drunk and kill people . Q ? And which outside power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nam ? A ? Until now it is Russia . The Chinese are trying to do now . It is very difficult for the Chinese to impose on the North Vietnamese . Ideologically , the North Vietnamese for years sided with the Soviet Union . Communist Viet Nam is caught between China and Russia . They will do nothing to upset that balance . Q ? Getting back to the issue of corruption , what did you do to combat it when you were in Viet Nam ? A ? When I was vice president , had nb power . I could do nothing ? I had less power than the Vice President in America . I do n't think people knew . Under my government while prime minister I established a special court to deal with corrupted people with a special rule . They have only two sentences , guilty or not guilty . It did n't take long for the court to open the trial . The bureaucracy and red tape normally takes years and years . Now with that court it took two weeks , and the judge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up public execution sandbags in the middle of cities . I did n't say under my government there was no corruption . It 's true with my own government , but at least the corrupt people were very Scared . They knew if I caught them I would execute them . Q ? Do Americans keep asking why you did not do more to stop corruption , and how do you feel about the view among some Americans , that you were as bad as all the rest ? A ? Such questions show how poor . is the knowledge of the American people about the outside world . For the last years I was out of power , I was not responsible . Q ? How . do you like it here ? How are your wife and children six of them , ranging in age from 11 to 22 doing ? A ? The children are happy . They adjust very well . My wife  --  not so well . It is difficult when you are older . When you compare the kids with the adults , you see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big attachment to the family . My oldest son the 22-year-old the other day came home ? he asked permission to marry . My wife tried to persuade him , ' You are too young . ' Finally I play the Godfather . I say ' no . ' . American parents could not do that . Q ? Ilow do you think Vietnamese in general are doing now ? What would have happened to you if you had stayed in your villa at Tan Son Nhut Air Base ? A ? They 're lucky now in comparison with millions of others  --  they got out . The North Vietnamese have executed a few officers besides sending many others to work camps . They executed those who proved they were good officers . They would not have let me stay in my home . I do not know what they woold have done  --  probably they would kill me . It would not be good for me . Q ? What did you think of the Americans in Viet Nam ? How competent were they as advisers ? A ? When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they always praise the Vietnamese  --  always say he 's a No. 1 tiger , but often they were praising a paper tiger . That 's the big trouble . To judge a foreigner it takes time . When first we Vietnamese come here , every American speak nice . It is difficult for you to know some people you never met before . The American adviser was there maximum one-to two-year tour . Tbey keep changing . How can you expect them to judge Vietnamese ? Also , this is the truth , they have to praise each other so they get c$Eck promotion . They have to say , ' this No. 1 outfit , and the Vietnamese officer also have to praise his adviser . So this is a kind of mutual admiration . I never had the feeling the officials in the Pentagon knew exactly the strength of the South Vietnamese army . They do n't know the enemy . They do n't know the friend . You did n't know either enemy or friend , so you last at the end ? it was no surprise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
