Courses are longer and sleeker , knickers have given way to bellbottoms , balls are livelier and travel farther , hickory staffs on clubs have been replaced by stainless steel or expensive graphite ( up to $2,000 per set ) . Those are the obvious changes in golf since the game was first played in Scotland some 500 years ago . <P> Less visible improvements in equipment have contributed even more dramatically to lowered scores . By thickening the base of club heads , manufacturers have concentrated their weight as low as possible - adding power to even a duffer 's swing . But for the final balancing of clubs - necessary to give a set of irons uniform " swing weight " - manufacturers until now have had to load the bottom of the shaft with bits of lead . Now Shamrock Golf Co. of Los Angeles has devised a technique for placing that additional weight in the club head itself - right at the " sweet spot " where metal meets ball ( see cut ) . Shamrock leaves a hollow slot in the head , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lead . <P> The Shamrock line was designed by Golfer-Engineer Ken Rogers , a wily links veteran who set 20 course records in the U.S. and holds three engineering degrees from Stanford . Rogers , 67 , never did well in tournaments because " I got so nervous I 'd throw up " ; high-stakes private matches are more his thing . His Shamrock clubs , he says , are going to give golfers the loft that has been missing from their long irons . " I 've finally developed the club I 've dreamed about since Bob Jones gave me my first set in 1930. "
