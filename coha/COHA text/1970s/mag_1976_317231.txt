THE PRESIDENCY <P> Out on the prairies last week , Ronald Reagan missed few opportunities to reveal his indulgence in prayer and Bible reading . About the same time , California Governor Jerry Brown , the former Jesuit seminarian , was walking among the fishermen of Maryland 's Eastern Shore , testing his presidential potential with scriptural overtones ( " He who enters last shall be first " ) . <P> It seems now to be an article of political faith that Americans want a man for President who reflects a strong and true strain of the basic precepts shared by our various religions . At the same time , Americans also seem to want their Presidents to retain a certain detachment from any one denomination . <P> Jimmy Carter is the fellow whose unabashed , if not totally strict Evangelicalism brought this all up . Is he exploiting his religion to gather delegates ? Or is there some deeper national yearning that is moving people toward him as the first to express so openly his spirituality ? <P> One who has pondered the question is Dean Francis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago passed his 25th anniversary up on Mount St. Alban , which looks out over the capital . He is one of eleven people born in the White House ( Jan. 17,1915 , in a small chamber near the Lincoln Bedroom ) , grandson of Woodrow Wilson , onetime secretary to F.D.R. 's political chief James Farley and friend or acquaintance of every President since then . The lanky Sayre has some of the Wilson profile and a lot of the inner fiber : he denounced McCarthyism , stood with the civil rights marchers , and marched to the <P> White House to protest Nixon 's 1972 Christmas bombing of North Viet Nam . He has preached to Presidents , helped bury them , prayed with them and counseled them . He has put his cathedral into governmental life , opened the Gothic chasms to Methodists , Jews and Billy Graham . Dean Sayre is theologian , historian and a bit of a power broker . He is worried - but fascinated by the political drama all about him . <P> Our country was created by those people from a decaying Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " They established an ethical and moral government , he says , but not a government to be run by a monarch or a church . " Every aspect of our democracy comes from these vestigial remnants of that faith , " the dean insists . Up until recently , as he sees things , we could take politicians of common stripe and at the moment of inaugural turn them into leaders who could justly be trusted with this moral heritage . <P> " Andy Jackson , " muses Dean Sayre , " was a dirty old soldier before he came to the White House , and Lincoln , this fellow of the prairie , we 've had no more religious leader in all our history . Wilson had a vision . Harry Truman , that haberdasher from Missouri , he was a towering figure of moral probity . American people expect it in our system , but the more <P> recent Presidents have hardly been mindful of it . " <P> At present , declares Sayre . <P> Americans are wallowing , trying to recover what they had before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
