txt Oklahoma City , Jan. 19 Ill ' ? Ray York , 14 , who wants to attend his neighborhood school instead of his assigned one , spent today in a United States marshal 's office instead of the classroom . The marshal 's office has a court order to place York in custody every school day until he agrees to attend Harding Junior High school . York was taken into custody by United States Deputy Marshal Richard F. Moerck when he arrived at Taft Junior High school , his neighborhood school . A court order  --  effective today  --  prohibits York , a white student , from attending Taft Junior High school and orders him to attend Harding provided he wishes to remain in public schools . Federal District court Judge Luther Bohanon issued the order last week , saying York 's attendance at Taft was disrupting efforts to integrate Oklahoma City schools . The confrontation today occurred before about 25 supporters and newsmen in 9-degree weather and was without incident . " Son , you 'll have to go with me , " Moerck told York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , approached the school . He was taken to the marshal 's office , where he spent the day reading magazines and drinking hot chocolate . Bobonon had ordered the youth held until the end of the school day each day he shows up at Taft . He was to be released to his parents ' custody at the close of each school day . The marshal 's office said the boy had not been arrested , that he merely was taken into custody . Asked the difference , a spokesman said : " Technically , there is n't any . " Mrs. York said she asked the marshal if he was arresting her and " he said ' no , ' he was not arresting me but he was going to take my child . " Other Children at Home " He volunteered to let me go baby sit , but little do any of you realize , I have two other children I have to take care of and I am fighting for them and for the rest of the children in Oklahoma City , " she said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boy to Taft , she replied , " I do n't think it would do much good . But never , never will he go to Harding . " Mrs. York said she would keep the boy home for the rest of the week .                     @x txt
