 | " Good , " I say . We sigh . Smiling Mary sighs . " How about three in trade and two in cash ? " I say . " I 'd like a little coin of the realm . " " Ha , " says the Barber . He inflates his jowls : this is the way he thinks and it makes him look as though he should be locked up , or wear one of those hats with flaps for ears . I blow my cheeks up , too . Smiling Mary glowers . For a moment I wonder whether she keeps one of the M-16s loaded . She 'd go through the neighborhood like wildfire , Stargell , she 'd show people what she thinks , all right . " Four in trade and one in cash , " says the Barber . " You 're going to start paying juice at twenty . " This is n't idle talk : I 've seen old women in the neighborhood , walking horror shows of themselves , drawn , dry , just back from scrubbing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the twenty dollars they borrowed from the Barber when they were young and foolish . " All right , " I say , " O.K. " Smiling Mary touches her bruise , cradles her breasts in her folded arms . " I 'll put in your number , " says the Barber . " Good , " I say . The store itself is a space about ten feet on a side and it is in front of the counter , a plank covered with linoleum : it looks the way it should considering the deals that have been closed over it . The linoleum is turning up and is worn away in places and there are cigarette burns , as regular as the marks on Robinson Crusoe 's calendar , along three sides . I take a loaf of bread from the shelf , ask for some salami and American cheese . Smiling Mary gives me three quarts of beer , too . I watch her working at the machine , moving it quickly back and forth , the blade turning with the ease of a flying saucer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I  | worked on in the think tank , but she 'd just look as though her kidneys hurt . The cutter was built right over the scales . No more walking half the day to weigh things . My boss , the Slasher , looked at the drawings and said , I do n't like Wops . Think about oil . It was n't long before the moths took me . I think for a moment of their dry , fluttering wings , the stark kaleidoscope markings on them . " That 's four dollars , " says the Barber . " Your number is fifty cents . " I look at the sad brown paper , the sack the Barber pushes at me . " Here 's four bits , " he says . Smiling Mary watches as he pushes the quarters across the counter : she looks like a submariner who 's just seen a leak . The Barber is also the local distributor for clothes that have been ( let 's call a spade a spade , Stargell ) hijacked off trucks . The Barber is suspicious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is a Seventh Avenue rack stuffed with red-and-white plastic raincoats which have been cut to look like western shirts . The Barber says , " They ai n't got no legs . They ai n't moving . " The rack is shoved against the refrigerator for the M-16s . At the Barber 's feet are boxes of shirts in cellophane pouches : the shirts are purple and green and they remind me of Nogales , Mexicali , Tijuana , border-town madness . Once I heard the Barber say to one of his salesmen , a man who smoked a cigar and chewed gum at the same time , and who wore the Barber 's clothes as a walking advertisement , " It 's pure profit for you after you sell the first ten coats . " The salesman was wearing one and he looked like he had the malaria sweats . " Yeah , sure , " he said , " only they do n't breathe so good . " I stare at the shirts , the fabric that looks as if it had been  | dyed by a color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , Stargell . Have a shirt . " He picks up a green one in its cellophane sack , holds it up to me , and says , " Yeah . That looks pretty good , do n't you think ? " Smiling Mary nods , even though the Barber has n't looked at her . " Enjoy , enjoy , " says the Barber , giving me the shirt . " Thanks , " I say , thinking , Tonight I 'll wear the shirt , drink a half gallon of Thunderbird , and break all the furniture . The Barber pours himself another shot of porcelain remover . I can hear glassy thunder as I open the door . It 's February and there 's still snow on the ground , but I can feel the first stirrings of spring , the tick in the roots , their squirmy anticipation of light , warmth , clear water . There are four or five dogs on the street , lean , alert , and they stalk old men , wait to pull one down . The old men usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a piece of pipe . You can see them saying , Just try it , you mangy curs , just give me the chance . Women stand in the doorways and smoke cigarettes . I check the mail , find bills for me , a letter for Enid , then climb the slate stairs , the four flights . Our apartment is not beautiful : three rooms , one of them a kitchen with a shower in it , a bedroom behind a glass door , a living room . We have some ugly furniture I bought on a heritage binge : chairs , sofa , tables , and lamps that came out of a Holiday Inn , class of ' 62 . " Hello ! " I say . My darling is in bed and she is asleep .  | " Time to get up , " I say . I rattle the beer bottles in the sack . Darling wife hears them . She stirs . It 's four o'clock in the afternoon . The living room is filled with books and papers , a halffinished glider I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ napkins , piles of dirty clothes . This is the beginning of our third year on the nuptial job . I clear a space on the table , make a plow of my forearm , then open a bottle . The carbonated hiss reminds me of my childhood and youth , days on the beach , the pale sunshine . I was born in California , almost thirty years ago . Here I sit in the dark furrows of New York , drinking a quart of Rheingold . The bedroom is dim , shielded from the dead-man 's light of the air shaft . There are stirrings within . I hear the rustle of sheets , a grunt , the squeak of a spring . Enid emerges . " What 's in the bag ? " she says . Only she says " bug . " " Victuals , " I say . " What 's that ? " she says . English is Enid 's fifth language . In the middle of a great fight , a real scar-maker , I 'll scream , Stop acting like you shit ice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll say , You are behaving with a certain amount of pretension . That may well be , she 'll say . Arch as a cat . " Salami and cheese . " Enid sits opposite me , opens a bottle of beer , drinks . There are long bubbles in the bottle 's neck . " Ah , " says Enid . " Ah . " We sit opposite each other . Enid is short and dark , and her skin is the color of ripe wheat , her eyes a black that verges on purple . She has a crooked smile , which she says gives her " charm . " " Good morning , " I say . I toast her , gently clink bottles . Enid wears a long gray 7  | wrapper and it makes her look like a bird with its gray wings folded . Enid 's eyes are puffy with sleep , watery with carbonation . " I had a strange dream , " says Enid . She stares at the wall beyond my shoulder where she sees some nocturnal rerun . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to search for headline omens . " Yes , my dear , " I say , all fifty-buck-an-hour sympathy . " I was chewing gum and my teeth got stuck in it and then there was a big ball of teeth and gum in my mouth . My teeth came out and they were in the gum . It was terrible . " I have my suspicions about this , but I keep them to myself . Enid has enough to deny as things stand now . I make some sandwiches and we eat in silence . Enid 's cheeks are full , moving . She licks her fingers . " Yum , " she says . I can see Enid eying the third quart of beer . Always buy things in even numbers , Stargell , I think , it makes matters easier . I want the beer , too , but I 'm not above sharing . Enid has stricter views of property . " How much money do we have ? " says Enid . " Fifty cents , " I say . " We 're poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the verge of tears . " We 're not alone , " I say . But Enid 's not convinced . She looks at the wall , thinks about chewing a wad of gum and teeth . Enid has delusions of European grandeur . Her father was an officer in the Greek army . Enid tells me she 's short because she did n't get enough milk after the war , and she gently chastises me about the stuff America sent for Greek kids to drink . Her family ( her mother 's side anyway ) think they can sell their blood by the ounce , as a souvenir . The  | old man , the ex-army officer ( who took Enid to the front during the civil war , where there was n't even any powdered milk ) , now has a shop in Athens . He has dreams of bringing to Greece the first flying machines for one man , those Buck Rogers jets with a harness . Until they 're perfected he 's contented himself with less fantastic inventions : some junk he gets from France , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost its money when a patriarch with the jack got caught by a religious high roller in Alexandria . The great-grandfather put the money into war bonds and a map to paradise . They never caught the priest . I keep asking to see the map , but no one 's showing it . You can buy Egyptian bonds from the First World War by the bale . Enid was sent to school in New York . It 's a stand-off now : the odd quart sits on the table between us . " You want another sandwich ? " I say . " No , " says Enid . It 's almost bedtime for Enid : a couple of hours of waking agony is about all she can stand . We stare at one another . " I did n't think we 'd be poor , " says Enid . " I 've got a job , " I say . " Yes , dear , you do , " she says . She means that 's the problem : I 've been driving a cab recently . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much . " This is heavy artillery , and I know Enid 's serious about that last quart . She 'll have a good day , you know , if she can just get that beer and climb into bed . She points at the bottle on the table and says , the way an anarchist lights a fuse , " Can I have a little more ? " " Of course , " I say . " I think I 'll have a glass , too . "  | She sours . It 's not even hers yet and she 's already unhappy to lose a glass . I fill a dirty tumbler , one with some whitish scum around the top . Enid stares : if a look could break glass , the tumbler would have shattered . " There , " I say . I put the bottle down and Enid wraps her small hand around its neck , pulls the quart to her side of the table , cradles it . She takes a sip , then looks over my shoulder to the wall , where there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When I get straightened out , " she says , " I 'm going to dance like a black . " There are rats in the apartment and I have told Enid to think of them as pets , since they wo n't go away . She started laughing , and in her case , that 's a bad sign . I 'm almost done with my tumbler . " What day is it ? " says Enid . " Tuesday , " I say . I slowly reach for the bottle and Enid 's face is stricken with displeasure , anger . My hand is spread out in the middle of the table . Enid picks up the bottle and brings it down on my fingers with a practiced , roach-killing motion . " Ow , " I say . I shake my hand as though it were wet . " That 's mine , " she says . I admire the action of her wrist , the quick movement of the bottle . " I think I 'll have a sip more , " I say . She sees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . Enid , my darling , I 'm not as safe as you think . But she has spine , the courage of her greed . " I need the beer , " she says . " I want a sip , " I say .  | " No , " she says . " I 'm depressed . " She 's going psychological on me . I can see her sink . Explanations , explanations . She 'll explain her life away . " Well , well , " I say . I drum my fingers on the table . " I 'll get better , " she says . I stare out the window , at the dead-man 's light , the clothes hung across the air shaft . " You are my own true love , " she says . " You know that . " She stands , nods , bows as though accepting applause , makes a Garbo exit . I can hear her getting comfortable in bed . She sighs . I follow her into the bedroom , but she does n't like that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I say . I drop the envelope on the counterpane . By the handwriting I can see it 's from her father : all the letters are standing at attention . Enid snaps on a light as though she were taking medicine , reads . I 'm all ears . Stargell , I think , maybe the old boy will spring for a few drachmas and Enid can get her legs waxed : it 's as good as a shot of dope . Enid folds the letter . " What 's up ? " I say . " My father 's coming to visit , " she says . She turns out the light . " Maybe you could drive longer hours , " says Enid . " That way we could have a little more money . " This does n't sound half bad . I enjoy the devotional , fastlike quality of a sixteen-hour shift . " He 's coming to look for a product , " says Enid . " You know , to make money . " Still scheming , I think , Stargell , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold , but the old hound is still quivering , has still got his nose in the wind . " Maybe we could borrow an apartment , " says Enid .  | " What 's wrong with this ? " I say . " Nothing , " says Enid , but you can see she thinks it 's not what suits quality . Let 's face it , I think , the place is a dump . But as far as they go , it 's not bad . Cozy . Romantic , in fact . One day we 'll laugh about this so hard we 'll cry . " When 's Aristotle going to arrive ? " I say . Enid looks toward the air shaft : I think she sees a big ball of gum and teeth and it 's rolling right out of Macedonia . " Next week , " says Enid . She lets me sit on the bed , but she bristles when I reach for the bottle . " I miss my father , " says Enid . " I do n't want any gun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He does n't carry a gun anymore , " says Enid . She looks at me and blinks . " I think , " she says . The old boy used to pack one , though , a forty-five , and he menaced the happy souls around him . He 'd say , You . You there . Waiter . Bring me a whiskey soda and make it snappy . He 'd wave the forty-five under the waiter 's nose . When he took Enid to the front , she got frostbitten feet . It always excites me when she tells it : she was left with the radio operator when the action started , and I see her in a tent in Macedonia , laughing and crawling around on a sleeping bag while the mortar shells burst in the air . The old man is all right by me . Maybe he should bring a gun , I think , and a forty-five is just the thing for nice , tight work , the kind you have to do in New York . " He says he 's got to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her a chamber of commerce grin : it makes me feel fat to smile like that . I feel the old surge , too . What if the old boy makes a killing ? Easy street for the kids , I 'd say . 12  | Enid pulls the covers to her chin , nestles back into the pillow , sips the beer . She squeezes my arm . " Goodbye , my darling , " she says . I go into the living room and find my cigar box , the money coffin . Inside there 's the driver 's regalia , pen , watch , and clip . There 's my license , too : a picture of me looking as sincere as death . It 's not a bad face , really , I think , if you 're in the market for one that 's kind of handsome and belongs to someone who 's probably looked into one secret too many . " Comfy ? " I say through the bedroom door . " Ummmmm , " says Enid . I 'd like to pop you one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lick that would make the genes hum . " Bring home some beer , " says Enid . She whispers in the dark , pulls the pillow against her cheek . My anger passes and I 'm left holding the cigar box , standing before the apartment door . " I love you , " says Enid . I take my jacket from its hook and go . " Sweet dreams , " I say . The first time I saw Enid she was standing in the living room of an apartment that had a view of the East River . A Magritte on the wall , cut flowers , furniture that had been comfortable two hundred years ago . A man was pursuing her so eagerly I thought he was going to say , Ca n't you see I 'm somebody ? For Christ 's sake , I 've got a seat on the Exchange , and I 've put money into a movie . Enid was sipping a drink , looking out the window , watching the silken , foam-webbed rises on the river . 13  | " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , " said Enid . She looked over his shoulder . " I have a court at my place , " said Exchange . " I 'll teach you . " " No , " said Enid . Exchange liked her accent , and he said , " I go to foreign films . " He put his hand gently on her forearm . It was a slimy , vulgar gesture . " Do you know what 's wrong with you ? " said Enid . " No , " said Exchange . " You 've been through analysis , " said Enid , " and it worked . " That a girl , I thought . You 're the one for me . Exchange drifted away . Later , in the bathroom , I saw him take a pill from a small silver box . Take a shower , too , Jack , I thought . Welcome back to dread . Punched out again , hmmm ? Well , someone 's got to wear out the couch , and it might as well be you . " Hello , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I stood next to her . " You want to talk to me ? " I said . " Yes , " said Enid . " You . " Later , when we were taking a shower together , she put both hands to her hair , tried to keep it dry . " You can wash me if you want to , " she said . The Star Garage is cavernous , cold : it makes me think of potato cellars . I walk through the cold streets , over the gray leavings of winter , the drifts covered with soot : it looks more like they 're decomposing than melting . I pass  | beautiful women . They can sense it , too . Winter dies . The wake is coming . The beautiful women smile at me , dip their heads , blush slightly . I can feel that helium rise , a lighter-than-air tug . Stargell , I think , what you need is an insured automobile , a taxi . The day boys are breaking , and there 's a line of cabs up the avenue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signs on every roof . The taxis come into the garage one at a time , stop at the gas pumps . Their drivers seem to have a just-back-from-the-front weariness . Munson 's the night dispatcher , a tall man , six four anyway , who has a large belly , a long face , a grin that 's compounded of ulcers and dirty jokes . The night men stand behind him , just waiting for a car , each with that quality of looking away from something unpleasant . The smell of exhaust fills the cement vault : it 's like living in a cool engine . " Hey , Stargell , " says Munson . " How you doing ? " " I 'm feeling so good , " I say , " they should n't let me walk the streets without a leash . " " Ha , " says Munson . He keeps his distance , though . I bob and weave , throw combinations , dwell for a moment on the mongoose , the incomparable Archie Moore . " You going to bust chops ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yeah . It 's time to bust chops . " I 'm a driving man : California was my Yale and my Harvard . The night boys seem a little grim , Stargell , everyone 's got their smoke screen out . You can smell the sooty odor , the fear . " What 's up ? " I say . Munson avoids my eyes , calls a name , sends one of the boys on his way . " They 're just a little edgy , " says Munson . It 's as though he were speaking of massuh-men , dumb  | beasts who are so low as to be running on lizards ' brains : smell and light more than numbers and words . I want to kick Munson in the balls , just to remind him of the Declaration of Independence . " No kidding , " I say . Another cab comes in and Louis the Scum , the garageman , gasses it up . I smell the execution odor . " No kidding , " I say . Munson looks at me and says , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " How 's he doing ? " I say . " Fine , " says Munson . " His worries are over . " I look at the gas and oil mixed with water on the floor : the spectral colors are the only lively things in the garage . The men along the wall are gray imitations of themselves . The Cowboy is there , too , and he waves . We started work together , just four months ago . We stood around , ignoring each other , the fact that we had both come to the same end of the line . A tired little alarm clock of a man made us get into the front seat of a taxi . He said , Turn on the ignition . There are your turn signals . That switch makes the meter go . The Cowboy has brown hair , a thin , hard West Virginia face , lousy teeth . He sat quietly while the instructions were hissed at us from the back seat . The Cowboy had a clipboard and he wrote everything down . The little slime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tires are expensive . Cowboy wrote this down , too . Afterwards Cowboy and I had a cup of coffee . Jesus , he said , in his voice that sounded like a talking banjo , I just want to do something right . Every now and then I 'll see him moving across town , determined , aloof , correct as newly creased pants . I wave back to him . Another cab pulls in.  | " I 'll take it , " I say to Munson . " Sure , " says Munson . I climb into the driver 's seat , wait for Louis the Scum to fill the tank . " Have fun , " says Munson . I start the engine , slap it into gear , push through the garage 's blue smoke : Munson , the anxious men , the dark cavern , are gone . Rush hour opens : short rides and low tips . Everyone 's sighing , settling , letting the old paunch show . The smell of martinis fills the car . Grand Central , Penn Station , Port Authority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begin . The cab is filled with the scent of perfume , beautiful women . They go to dinner , the theater , parties , movies . Stargell , I think , life is grand . I listen to the nylons swish together , the sound of a firm ass on the seat . A beauty thanks me as I give her some change and I can feel her warm , damp breath on my fingers . There 's no doubt about it , Stargell , I think , you 've suffered a little setback : this death-drone patrol has got to stop . It was n't so long ago that I had prospects , expectations . Enid and I were invited to black-tie dinner parties , Fifth Avenue affairs where the butlers moved with a quiet , oiled grace . What times , Stargell . I remember the lingering perfume , the taste of dry champagne , the slick ease of an oyster . I was a freak for these people , and when 17  | I told Enid about it , she got mad . There is only one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invited to lunch , or dinner , my abilities are no longer praised . But I 'm not old enough to know better ( that 's just too fucking old ) , so maybe I 'll kick the city in the slats , just to see it jump , just to taste champagne again , to look everyone in the eye and say , How nice to see you . I met Barbeau at a dinner party given by a great old cripple : she had a motorized tricycle and a horn with a rubber bulb . The cripple loved to use the horn , to come up behind someone and sound off : everyone looked as though his ass had just been grabbed . Barbeau and I were seated at the same table . " I understand you 've invented some things , " said Barbeau . Barbeau was about twenty-eight . Her eyes were green and her hair had a special color . It 's not blond , not silver , sometimes dark , always touched by bright specks : it 's the color of deer in November . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 'd been looking for a husband , a man who had a fortune equal to her own , and who was n't queer or dull as wet bread . She had n't been successful . I could smell the strange whiff of desperation , her dry-ice odor . I told her about a street with hinges at the gutter ( you lift up small sections with a crane : no more jackhammers ) , space industry ( perfect ball bearings made in free fall ) , a recording of a tortured , teased mouse ( you play it and all the mice run out of your house ) .  | " I 'm wearing silk underwear , " she said , " with a slit in the crotch . " Stargell , I thought , what is this ? Our legs touched under the table . I stuttered . She spilled her wine . " They 're very comfortable , " she said . The old cripple on the tricycle had an expression on her face that said ( as loud as a bullhorn ) , The freaks , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and beautiful young women . Those were the times , Stargell . They should have charged you an hourly rate for being alive . " Is there any insanity in your family ? " said Barbeau . Yes , yes , I thought , we 're all as crazy as coots . We throttled the last straight one a year before I came to New York . He 's in a shallow grave , in Ventura , just over the Los Angeles county line . Barbeau finished her glass of wine and looked at me with the eyes of a horse in a stable fire : I could see the reflection of the candle 's flames . " I want you to make me a baby . " For a moment ( and longer than that ) I was sure she was absolutely serious . The old bat on the tricycle came crashing through the room , almost pushing the tables and guests aside : she knew we could n't possibly be discreet , and the crip was n't going to have any part of that . Barbeau was taken home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His name was Jimmy . She married him in about six months . Once , after the engagement was announced , I went to visit her with one of her friends . In those days , Barbeau was big-time shrink fodder : every morning . Her fortune came from bandages . Her friend and I found her , just up from a nap , looking out the window , her face a little red . i  | The sun was low , and I could smell that dry-ice odor , could feel her distance . She looked up and smiled , and said , " I 'm sorry about the underwear . " " Do you really have them ? " I said . " Yes , " she says , " but I ca n't show them to you . " I 've kept track of Barbeau , and every night , when I start my downtown cruising , I hesitate in front of her building . I have n't seen her yet . The end came at the think tank because of the moths : I had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Department of Entomology , University of California , Berkeley , that moths spend a moment or two shivering before taking off . This shivering is necessary to warm up the wing joints , which are filled with oil . I was sitting on the twenty-eighth floor , looking out the window , watching the sluggish beauty of the river , the white puffs of silk from the top of the generating plants . Stargell , I thought , this is it . I had certain discretionary powers ( what words : I could spend almost whatever I wanted ) because of the success of the Stargell , and some other gadgets . So I ordered a hundred thousand moths , a hydraulic press , a centrifuge , rented a warehouse to put everything in , ordered , too , some stuff to refine what I had begun to think of as " moth crude . " I spent about half a million , which , all things considered , is a drop in the bucket , but the Slasher did n't see  | it that way . I tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we could have a mountain of moths , millions of barrels of oil . Two moths ( under ideal conditions ) can produce two trillion ( of the lovely creatures ) in just six generations . " You 're through in this shop , " said the Slasher . Jolting Joe , from security research , came to say goodbye when I was cleaning out my desk . The doorman whistles : I stop the cab . Barbeau gets inside . In a tired voice she gives me the address she wants . I drive across town , staring into the rear-view mirror . She looks a little older ( it 's been three years ) , and I can still smell the dry-ice odor . She watches the trees in the park , the snow there . I want to scream , How 's the underwear ? I think of you all the time , my darling . I 've been lurking around your house for months , just to get a peek . My wife is crazy . Barbeau lets me see the lines of her face , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shakes her head , lapses into the tired , drawn look of a woman who is just itching to have a good time . Do you recognize me ? I think . Can you see who 's driving you now ? Barbeau gets out of the taxi and walks up the steps of a brownstone . I watch her hips , their cool tug and drop in the cloth of her dress . I 'm glad to see her . Stargell , I think , you lucky dog . 21  | I do n't even bother to think about it : I pick up a man in a flasher 's raincoat . He 's got his hand in his pocket . " West Ninety-eighth , " he says . " I 'll tell you where to stop . " His coat is greasy , stained , and he has a hat pulled over his face , but you can still see he 's as cheerful as death row . " Step on it , " he says . The cab sounds like a trash can that 's filled with pieces of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about to break the sound barrier . I do n't like that hand in the pocket . That looks bad . It 's his right hand . " Nice night , " I say . " Yeah , " he says . I drive on , try to forget about Death Row , calculate the length of the sine curve that moves along the computer lights : three hundred and twenty yards at the base . I try to do the summation for the curve . If he 'd just take his hand out of his pocket , I think , if he 'd just let me see what he 's got in there . " I 'm finishing up for the night , " I say . Stargell , I think , sometimes you even amaze me : this is advertising yourself as a bank . Shit . " Shut up and drive , " says Death Row . The atmosphere builds . I cross at Ninety-sixth street . The intersection is filled with purple light and the corners are crowded with men who are drinking wine . The atmosphere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sidewalk , bleeding onto the concrete . You can see the holy slickness , his life reflected in it . A friend is still  | giving him an occasional sip . Others watch , gossip : you can see their breath , the white and floating words . We go up Riverside Drive . The Hudson looks like dark oil and the lights from New Jersey are smeared over it . I think of seaports , harbors , the scent of diesel oil , the sound of bilge being pumped at the slip , the yellow light of a dive . The deadbeat just sits behind me , looking as happy as a man who 's got mousetraps hanging from every finger . I turn into the street he wants , climb the slight hill . There are rows of brownstones , no street lamps . The taxi idles . There are some trees on the street and they are as leafless as roots . " Stop here , " he says . I stop the car , the meter , wait . Death Row gets out of the back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slams . Stargell , I think , take a good look , make the postcard , since you may not be by this way again . I turn toward Death Row and there it is , a thirty-eight , long barrel , full belly . He taps the gun against the window and I roll it down quickly . " Give , " he says . The light on the gun is strangely silver , hard as ice . He puts the nickel-plated barrel against my head . " Here , " I say . I give him the box and my wallet . Death Row seems hesitant . You do n't have to shoot . You really do n't . My expression says , I do n't see shit , boss , and if I do , I do n't remember too good . Death Row seems unsure . All right , I think , all right . Shoot then . Even murder would n't help scum like you . But he takes off , running , his dirty coat flopping from side to side . I watch as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart , the rising sensation that comes from speed : I put the cab into gear and when I come to  | the intersection I 'm doing sixty miles an hour . The taxi drifts into the oncoming traffic as I make the turn . Horns honk . My smile deepens . Stargell , I think , most things are great , as long as you live through them . I pass Death Row . He sees me wave as I go by , since I 'm feeling as generous as an Eskimo who 's just filled himself with caribou and rotting salmon . It does n't last , though . The incandescence dies and I 'm left with the certain knowledge that after ten hours behind the wheel I 've only got the Barber 's fifty cents . I can smell Death Row 's fragrance , the stench of terror , so I pull over , open the doors , give the taxi a nice airing . On the floor , in the back seat , there are a wallet and a notebook . The notebook is the kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone who went screwy on haiku and rice : trim , neat , covered with plastic leather . The wallet has no money in it , but there 's a complete set of identification . I look at a picture on one of the cards and remember the man , who was as grim as surgical clamps . He said , " Do you know of a woman who . . . you know . . . does n't mind taking a few bucks to be slapped around ? ... " I open the notebook and see there is only one entry . It has today 's date . Barbeau 's name , telephone number , and address are written on the flyleaf . Jimmy ( reads Barbeau 's one entry ) is afraid of burglars . There have been a couple of houses broken into recently in our neighborhood . Jimmy has bought what the detective books call a " sap , " and this evening when  | I was preparing a rib roast , Jimmy brought the sap into the kitchen and said he wanted to try it out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ribs . We ate it later . His problems persist . I pull into the Star . I 've got Barbeau 's small notebook in one pocket , the wallet in another . The night boys are leaving their cabs and Louis the Scum is gassing them up . Louis the Scum has an assistant who takes the cabs and parks them someplace . Munson is standing at the counter , but he sees me , comes my way . " How 's my favorite ? " he says . " How 's the inventor ? " I have a wounded expression , empty hands . " What happened to your box ? " says Munson . The night boys are working on the counter , figuring their bank , their tips . They look like accountants doing the books for a Hooverville . " I got jacked up , " I say . " That 's a shame , " says Munson . His face is set with veteran concern : he 's used it before . The exhaust is at high tide . Everyone in the garage has red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No , " I say . " That 's good , " says Munson . He slaps me on the back . " That 's really good . " The night men drop their cash envelopes into the safe and then they take their boxes ( Don Diego , Producto , Garcia Y Vega , El Primador ) and leave . Each drops a 25  | shoulder and plunges into the darkness as though trying to break down a door . " That 's tough , kid , " says Munson . " That 's really ... you know , awful . " " Yeah , " I say . The garage is cool as low-tide sand . " You know what I got for ten hours work ? " I say . " Look , " says Munson . He begins to turn away , looks at the office as though it were a lifeboat . I feel like a shark . " I know how you feel .... " " I have n't got a fucking thing ! " Munson eyes expand . It looks like he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I 'm still tempted to let go completely , to take a tire iron and break the windows out of every taxi in the garage . Munson 's scared . That feels good , too . Everything feels fucking great ! " Look , " I say , " if I do n't get something I 'm going to pop you one . And you are n't going to forget it . " " Sure , " says Munson . " Yeah , " I say . There are still a couple of night boys standing at the counter . They 're making small piles of bills , counting on their fingers since they ca n't add . They look at Munson , and he does n't want trouble with them , so he glances back with a face that 's as good as saying , I 've got Stargell under my thumb . Everything 's under control . Tidy . I know what Munson 's made of , though : sponges and dried chicken bones . " Shhh , " says Munson . " Stop screaming . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " These things happen , " says Munson . Holy shit , I think , he 's getting philosophical . The payoff ca n't be far away now . Munson reaches into his pocket and fishes out a twenty  | he keeps there for these occasions . He sticks it into my shirt pocket , does it with a spirited paternalism , an easy concern , a slap on the back . Munson takes care of the boys : that 's what he wants us to think . He just sends us to the front every night . I take the twenty and my anger breaks up , dissolves , leaves me standing in the cold , damp garage . Stargell , I think , it was a twenty-dollar rage , one that was n't worth breaking all the windows for . " Get smashed , " says Munson . " That 's what I 'd do . " I shrug . The illiterates are still struggling . I smell the air , the exhaust : it 's enough to make an oilman happy . Louis the Scum stands near the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't know what to do with himself . He looks like a man guarding a border with a nozzle from a gasoline pump : crazy enough to be serious but too nuts to be effective . " It was great , " I say to Munson . " The cars , the city , the women ... " " Come into the office , " says Munson . We walk across the floor , the rainbow oil , up two steps , and into the office . There are two wooden chairs ( oak with slats : early FBI ) , a desk that 's notched with cigarette burns , an ashtray from a tire company , a calendar with an Oriental woman on it . She 's discreetly nude , coquettish . " Here , " says Munson . He takes a shot glass from the desk and fills it . There 's an inscription on the glass that says , " Just a swallow away , " and the picture of a bird with a tail like partly opened scissors . The liquor is familiar , raw . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " On Seventh Avenue . Pow . " I slam my hand onto the desk . I can still hear it : the tinny , bass-drum thump , the Oriental tinkle of glass , a moment of silence . Everyone on the 27  | street turned toward the cars , which were locked in a steamy , leaking embrace . Then there were screams , shouts , two drivers ( great counterpunchers when it came to insults ) giving each other what for . " Pow , " I say . Munson raises an eyebrow , pours me another shot . He has a water tumbler and he fills that with liquor , too , then opens a little packet that has two Alka-Seltzers inside . He drops them into the glass . We listen to the slight oceany buzz . " It helps , " he says . " You 'd be surprised . " I put the swallow glass next to the ashtray that sits on a small tire . " I could get a McDonald 's franchise , " says Munson . " What do you think of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say . Munson laughs . " You do n't take me seriously , " he says . He has a hound 's expression : sad , sad . I do n't think a million hamburgers would help . Munson looks at the garage the way a horse looks at a dog food factory : with more resignation than hope . I can feel the liquor move , it 's I-love-you warmth . Louis the Scum is standing uneasily , staring into the street . He 's about forty-five , small as a jockey , quick , dirty enough to live in a gutter . I heard a rumor that his skin was growing over his shirt . He carries a briefcase to the garage and at lunchtime ( about 2 A.M. ) he goes into the office to eat . He opens the leather box , takes out a small cloth , some china and silver , lays the table . He has a small bottle of Pouilly-Fuisse , pate foie , cold supremes champignons , broccoli vinaigrette , a small roll . Afterwards he has a cup of coffee from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the Oriental woman , smoking his  | cigarette . He closes up his meal and goes back to work . It is a way of praying . Now he stands , still holding the nozzle , waiting for a cab . " Well , " says Munson . " Let 's open the safe , " I say . " We 'll take the money and go to the track . " Munson pours me another , caps the bottle with a **29;931;TOOLONG twist . My difficulties tonight were three shots ' worth : not bad , not good . We celebrate irritation more than tragedy . " Seriously , " says Munson , " did n't that place you worked for have any ideas ? " " You 're asking me ? " I say . " You 're just fucked up , " says Munson . " That does n't mean you ca n't remember something you might have heard . " Stargell , I think , it 's nice to be asked . As a matter of fact , I 'm flattered . I remember the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read the listings in the futures market , the price of Egyptian cotton , and tell you who in the Middle East had just had a hemorrhoid removed . I 'm a little out of touch now . Just before the moths ( Lepidoptera heterocera , my darlings , with their fluttered bump ) , everyone at the office was staring out the window and dreaming up ways to get more money into frozen French fry futures . Even the Slasher was hot and greedy . I moon off a little . Munson sighs . From the office you can see both the entrance and the exit of the garage . The floor is below the level of the street , so there 's a descending ramp that runs from a hump at the sidewalk to the pumps , where Louis the Scum is king . Beyond the pumps there 's another ramp , which leads back to the street .  | " I 'm feeling better , " I say . " Good , " says Munson . He sighs again . Stargell , I think , he 's even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as quietly ill at ease as two old geezers who can hear a ticking clock . A cab is in the street , idling along , straining at the bump near the entrance ramp . It looks like a large yellow bird , a fantastic creature : both doors are open . The taxi hesitates , seems to rock back and forth at the bump , then strains again and rolls forward , descends . The doors open and close a little , flap like stiff wings . Munson 's face says , Something is n't right . The cab seems to be empty . It rolls slowly across the garage and up to the pumps . Louis the Scum puts the nozzle in the tank , lets the gas run . Munson and I walk out of the office . Louis the Scum looks inside the taxi , then jerks his head aside , as though someone were pulling his hair . " He do n't need gas , " says Louis the Scum . " He 's dead . " The taxi 's still idling . The blue smoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the car and turn off the ignition . There 's a mess on the front seat that used to be Cowboy . His life is everywhere , smeared , dripping , misting a little . Munson watches me gag . " He 's dead , " I say . Munson goes to the office to call the police . Another cab pulls into the garage , stops behind the Cowboy 's . The driver is squirming at the wheel , listening to the radio . He honks the horn . Louis the Scum says , " Shut the fuck up , you miserable scum bag . " " Yeah ? " says the driver . The driver 's got the Broadway heebie-jeebies . Moving , moving , moving : he 's held together with coffee and Tums , wine and aspirin .  | " Yeah , " says Louis the Scum . " We got a dead guy here . " " Oh , " says the driver . It must have happened close by . The Cowboy was just trying to make it home , smelling the vinyl seat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first date with that girl , he was thinking . When we stood on the porch . I remember , but why do n't I feel good at my stomach ? The last thing the Cowboy saw was the neon sign outside that says " Star . " " Who is it ? " says the driver . " Cowboy , " says Louis the Scum . I go into the office . Munson is sitting at his desk , staring at the Oriental nude . I can hear the driver in the garage say , " Jesus , there 's a grease job every night now . " I stand before Munson . " That 's , you know , ... " says Munson . " Awful . " " He was a good kid , " I say , " that Cowboy . " Munson stares into the garage . " He did n't bank much , " says Munson . The police cars look like helicopters with red rotors . I ca n't face a cop . I ca n't even face Munson anymore . The red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can feel them on my face . Red seems to be a weighty light . Cowboy 's lying out there in his cab , his hat full of some slime . " I 'm through , " I say . The office is filled with pulsing light : it 's as insistent as a sign that says " Eats , Eats , Eats . " The ambulance arrives , too . Everything is shrieking . A cop who came in from the beat is wearing a slicker and he looks like a big bird , dark wings folded . His bill , the visor of his cap , reflects the sanguine light . " We still got to talk to the cops , " says Munson .  | " Not me , " I say . " I 'm through with this shit . I 'll be around for my check . " It feels like there 's a butterfly under the skin , near the eye . I shake Munson 's sweaty hand . " What are you going to do ? " says Munson . He has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ withdrawn quality . Everybody who drives has been defeated . Munson does n't trust the outside world too much because that 's where he gets his drivers and they are a scary lot . They 're all religious . There 's a shrine in every taxi , a private collection of relics . I 'd like to ride along , to attend each small service . " Ah , " I say , " that 's the question . That 's it , all right . " I walk through the garage , past the police , the gray bird , the stuff they 're taking from the front of the taxi . I admire the skill of the ambulance men , their just-anotherstiff detachment . The air outside is cool but tainted : it smells as though it had come out of an aerosol can . Well , Stargell , I think , you 're unemployed again . I 'm going to miss it , though : the rush , the speed , the lights , perfume , the jumble of addresses , chance encounters . I would n't even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind you take from girlfriend to girlfriend , from ex-wife to ex-wife . They end up crying in the back seat because no one will let them in . And there 's thirty-five dollars on the meter . One said to me , Boohoo . Boohoo . I 've made another mess .  | Its 3 A.M. I kick a can , sing " Hail Britannia , " find myself standing in front of a bakery , inhaling the fragrant odor . I can see the wheat fields in August , blond and undulant , can smell the dust at the grindstone , can hear the machinery 's creaking gears . The bread into a van . I find myself in something like a trance , standing on the sidewalk , smelling bread in the oven . " Hey , bub , " says the man in white , " you ca n't stand there all night . You O.K. ? " I smile . " Look , " I say , " that bread smells good . " " You want a loaf ? " he says . " Yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's as warm as a baby . I hold it under my arm , feel the crust , as delicate as an eggshell , the springy and moist interior . The heat from the bread feels good . " I 've got some money , " I say . " I do n't want no money , " says the man in white . " Take the bread and beat it . Get out of here . " The delicatessen is up the street and I buy quarts of beer and a quarter pound of butter . There are women in the store , hothouse beauties , dressed with spangles and shawls : they only pause in front of mirrors , where they have no shame . They 're thinking , How do I look ? Am I beautiful ? The deli has the odor of incense and cocaine . I knock the snow off a low wall on Seventh Avenue , sit down there , spread the butter on the bread with my 33  | pocket knife . The bread is still warm and the butter melts . Stargell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picnic . I watch the hothouse beauties , eat the bread . It 's so good I could scream . In the hall of my building there are small tiles with six sides . The walls are two-tone , half green , half something else . The place has the atmosphere of a hospital in southern Italy . There 's one bulb burning at the end , near the staircase . The television is on , so I know Enid is still awake . I open the door , walk through the kitchen . Enid is in the living room , before the TV . It faces her and she is sitting in the gray comet glow of its light . " Hello ! " I say . " Shhhh , " she says . " There 's a movie on . " It 's a love story : I can hear the people crying . The music reminds me of something I heard in an elevator . Some years ago , to be sure . Stargell , you 've got to go and ride the elevators , just to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks up and says , " Did you bring podikimo a present ? " This means did I bring my mouse a slug of booze . I nod , give her a bottle from the bag . Enid has a long drink , goes back to the movie . I take off my jacket , have another piece of bread and butter , sit next to her . I touch her hand . She pulls away . " There 's a movie on , " she says . It 's a sad movie and by the end Enid is crying to beat the band . The music comes up . " I love you , " she says , " I love you . "  | This does n't mean anything , though . It 's just that the movie has gotten to her . If I were n't around she would say the same thing to the mirror . Her eyes are red . " I 'm tired , " I say . " So am I , " says Enid . I turn off the TV after we stare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a fifteen-dollar miracle , a three-time loser at the junkshop . I expect an engineer to show up now any day to find out why the goddamn thing is still working . It is the perfect blend of geriatrics and electronics : the television reminds me of an old genius . His signal is n't strong , but it 's as clear as a trout stream in July . " Hard day ? " I say . Enid nods , pulls her gray bathrobe to her neck . She still has some movie tears on her cheek , and I can see that she 's savoring them , clinging to a definite emotion , safe tragedy . " Do n't you be bad to me , " says Enid . We march into the bedroom . The walls are cracked and the dark lines look like the map of some long and complicated river : the Amazon , the Nile . I smell muddy water , hear the parrots shriek . It 's been so long I 've forgotten what it 's like . I try not to touch Enid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that would make an Eighth Avenue hooker tired just thinking about them . Maybe , Stargell , I think , you should put an ad in the newspaper , you know , spelling everything out , a blow-by-blow description of exactly what you want to do . There 'd be a line downstairs a mile long . Oh , yes , I think , and I 'd get to start at the beginning : young , old , fat , thin . " Why are your teeth chattering ? " says Enid . " Stop that . " I think of the early days ( just over three years ago ) when Enid and I were courting . I had an apartment with a 35  | skylight and Enid came to see me one night when it was raining . She climbed the stairs in her wet trench coat , spoke to me in her accented , spy-movie English . We made love beneath the lights of the city . " Do n't look at me , " says Enid . All right , I think , all right , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any movie to tell me so . I turn toward the wall , leave a space between it and me so that Enid can climb in . She wants to be on the inside in case Jack the Ripper should come through the door with his chopper . He 'd get me first and then Enid would have a chance of getting out alive : that 's the way she tells it anyway . I feel like I 've been at sea for a year . There is glory in Enid : she has a small Attic figure , dark hair . I can smell her . I put my arm across her side , snuggle next to her , put my nose against the nape of her neck . " No , " says Enid . " I 'm depressed . " It 's as final as a tombstone , but the urge lingers . It makes me feel as though I 've been handed a fire-and-brimstone rap . I 'm squirmy , all right , and Enid knows it . " What 's wrong ? " she says . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I say . I nod my head in the dark . Life is grand , thinks Enid , I 'm going to sleep . There 's plenty of Bud in the icebox . She drifts , twitches . I stare into the darkness , see the cracky map on the ceiling , hear the sounds of the waking tenement , the footsteps on the stairs . Alarm clocks are going off everywhere : the building sounds like a test market for two-dollar timepieces . Enid breathes as softly as a child . Then I 'm gone , too , drifting into a high-priced horror show . Boy , I think ( even when I 'm having them ) , these are terrible dreams , Stargell , you better have your head examined . But they 're pleasing in a way : the dreams are  | Technicolor and filled with stinging landscapes , waves as large as the swells from the Pacific in typhoon . A plucked chicken flies by . Stargell , I think , that 's the moths , my darling creatures . There are other things , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preglacial times . Finally I end up in a house outside Paris . It 's two-storied , sun-washed , has oxidized paint , a veranda , a wrought-iron balcony , shutters . The door downstairs is hung on handmade hinges . It 's shady in the garden , but the house is filled with light and there , on a brown settee , I see a woman . She 's about thirty and she has reddish hair that 's cut short and eyes that are a reddish brown and she has long legs . We 've known each other for years . The color of the cognac she drinks is the same as that of her eyes and hair and nipples . We care for one another , are gentle , watchful , considerate . We share a drink and get into bed . This is n't any tedious affair , any shoddy business : we 've been meeting for years and know how to play each other like flutes , or tubas , or maybe a whole marching band , but ( in any case ) well . The best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is a strange light to her , an odd glow that you ca n't see but is nevertheless there , as bright as Christmas candles . We get down to business and I can see her strain . Her head is thrown back and I can see her swallow , her neck moving . I begin to come and I wake up and it does n't stop anything . There I am , squirting all over Enid 's legs . " What , " says Enid with a jump , " are you doing ? " " Nothing , " I say . Stargell , I think , this is not the kind of thing you can lie about . " Oh , oh , oh , " says Enid . Enid stares at me , turns over , puts her hand on the back of her leg , then jerks it away as though she 'd touched a  | frog . She feels sullied . Raped . You 're nothing but a dirty pervert , Stargell , and do n't you forget it . The woman outside Paris dwindles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really miss her . " I 'm going to take a shower , " says Enid . " That 'll help , " I say . Enid backs away from me , then turns on her heel with a matador 's flourish : Gore me if you will , she 's thinking . I look at the clock and see that it 's 8 A.M. The sheets are cold and sticky . I sit up and listen to the sound of water in the metal shower , but it does n't run for long , since Enid knows where to wash . " I 'm sorry , " I say . Enid is wearing a child 's pink nightgown , one that covers her to her ankles . She looks as sour as morning-after wine . " You should control yourself , " says Enid . The room has a cold humming quality , as though the whole place were a funny bone and somebody had just slammed a door against it . I 'm ready to start raving about the Parisian , but Enid does n't like it when other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appearance on the street , when we go out to the movies , I 'll say , Look , there 's a pretty woman . And Enid will say , Her ? Why , she 's just a filthy slut . The light that comes from the air shaft looks like it has been filtered through yellow fingernails . Enid sits next to me , takes my forearm , and gives it a squeeze . We sit quietly for a moment or two , holding hands like any innocents . " I understand , " says Enid . She squeezes my hand again , gives me a small kiss on the cheek , and climbs into my side of the bed . " I 'll sleep in the living room , " I say . 38  | Enid snuggles in the pillow . " Yes , " she says , " that will be better . " When I unfold the beartrap bed , the convertible sofa , I find it 's already been made . Stargell , I think , at least she 's considerate . I slip into it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The tenement is filled with the sounds of footsteps on the slate stairs , the odor of strong coffee . The mornings are ceremonial here . I 'd like a cup of that coffee , the dark liquid with the scent of Turkey and Rio . I like mine with milk that is swollen with heat , just about to bubble . I drift off , thinking of dark women , their faces halved by a veil . I wake at an implosive pop : someone on the top floor has thrown a light bulb into the air shaft . Thank God , Stargell , you 've been dealt another . I see casino hands cutting the deck , snapping up a day that 's as sharp as a new card . Enid is still asleep . Our shower is made of tin , and I stand under the stream of water , hearing the Niagara splash . I 'm tempted to sing , but there 's enough trouble with the neighbors as it is . Jack the Ripper , who lives downstairs , is a fan of mine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hornbeam or hickory . She says she has to wear them because her feet hurt . So she passes back and forth in a Sing Sing gait , the exercise yard half-step . When Enid 's not sleeping she 's walking or trying to clean the oven with a toothbrush or sticking a Q-tip soaked with Windex into the corners of our rooms . These occurrences are rare , but definite . One day there was a timid knock at the door and I answered it . A man of about my height and weight ( five eleven , one  | hundred and sixty-five pounds ) was standing in the hall . " I 'm from downstairs , " he said , pointing in that direction . He had the face of a man who can not understand why anyone in the world would argue . " Look , " he said , " you 've got to stop walking around like that . It sounds like you 're walking on my head . Please do n't do it anymore . " " Sure , " I said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said apologetically . " Do n't mention it , " I said . The man left and I said to Enid , " Knock it off . You 're driving that guy crazy with your shoes . " Enid was pursuing the lint on the sofa with a pair of tweezers , using her pickings to make a ball of fluff that was as big as a grapefruit . " Fuck him , " she said . " I 'm talented , I 'm beautiful . Everyone says so . When I get straightened out I 'm going to dance like a black . So I can wear what I want . Do n't you tell me what to do . You are a hopeless failure and I do n't have to listen to anything I do n't want to . She 's turned her siren on : I listen until the words run together , until there is only noise and moving lips . She glares at me and then it 's back to the Q-tips and the toothbrush , the tweezers and the magnifying glass . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but at least she 's moving around . A few days after the first complaint , the urge took Enid in earnest . I came home from work and there she was , as bright as a new car . There was an eviction pile of furniture in the middle of the room , our table , both chairs , sofa ( the beartrap ) , a desk , lamps . I stood at the door and watched her drag some of our other sad sticks from the bedroom . The floorboards are loose and every one vibrated . Usually  | Enid hates our furniture , our pieces of junk , but then she knew the pride of the secondhand store could be beautiful if arranged properly . She had tears of gratitude in her eyes , an expression of beatific thanks . I smoked a cigarette and was as careful as a bird watcher . " It 's three o'clock in the morning , " I said . " I had an idea , " said Enid . " It could n't wait . " I touched her trembling hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her eyes were dark , wide , and they reflected light in a way that reminded me of broken glass . " Let 's wait until the morning , " I said . " You 're being bad to me , " she said . " No , " I said . " I 'll help you in the morning . " " I can see through you , " said Enid . " You 're being bad . " Enid was winding her spring , but I was saved : someone began beating on the door so hard it was going to come right off the hinges . And if it were n't going to come off the hinges , then the frame would be knocked out of the wall . My darling thought it was Jack the Ripper and a mess of choppers , so she hid in the bedroom . " My God , my God , " said Enid . She held two pillows to her head , bit her lip . " Who is it ? " I said . The pounding stopped . The tin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him go away , " said Enid . I was tired , groggy : it all seemed to be happening under a strange fluorescence . " Open the fucking door ! " said Jack the Ripper . Stargell , I thought , maybe the beast will listen to reason . Usually through the open door you can see the light bulb that hangs from the ceiling of the hall , but I did n't see anything , aside from Jack the Ripper : he filled the entire frame , and his face looked like it had gone through  | a windshield . The bones in his cheeks were covered with a tender web of scar tissue . His brother , the one who first asked me to stop Enid 's hard-soled walking , stood behind him . Occasionally the brother jumped up to look over Jack the Ripper 's shoulder . " He 's the diplomat , " said Jack . He pointed a thumb the size of a Mason jar over his shoulder . The shorter brother had , when I could see him , an avenger 's smile , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been making a hell of a noise . Stargell , I thought , just look at Jack . Just think what you could do with an army of Rippers . No problems then , my boy . Jack 's shoes were large . All you needed to go with them is a pair of oars . " He asked you to be quiet , " said Jack , " did n't he ? " I squinted at the brother for a moment , then nodded , revealed some distant recognition . This did n't sit well with Jack : I could see he was a direct sort of fellow . " Yes , " I said . " You call this being quiet ? " I shook my head . Jack looked me in the eyes . " How come you moving the fucking furniture ? " he said . " You behind on the rent ? " " No , " I said , but I was thinking , Not yet . Jack the Ripper 's skin looked as though it had been made out of greasy burlap . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kind you see in the faces of lifelong model builders : everything is done by numbers , instructions . " I ai n't a diplomat , " said Jack . " So this is what I 'm telling you . If it ai n't quiet , we 're going to fight . " I nod . " O.K. , " I said . " My brother has to move out , " said Jack , " my own flesh and blood ca n't stay under my roof . You think I like that ? "  | I shake my head . Maybe Jack would like to borrow Enid . She 's not flesh and blood , but she still packs a wallop . " You listen to me , " he said . " I do n't make , you know , just threats . " Jack the Ripper and his brother walked away , descended . I closed the door , while thinking , Stargell , he did n't say he 'd rip your arms off , did n't say he 'd throw you down the air shaft . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 'd be some resistance . That was good news . " Is he gone ? " said Enid . " Yes , " I said . I tried to hide my feelings , but I broke into a smile that was as broad as a beach . Enid looked suspiciously at me for a moment ( smiles make her nervous ) and then said , " Good . Now I can finish . " I shook my head . " In the morning , " I said . Enid stood there , looking at me as though I 'd thrown a drink in her face : proud , enraged , mythically offended . That a girl , I thought . An ounce of that will buy you a pound of ice-pick murder . " O.K. , " she said , " but I 'll remember this . " We searched for the TV in the pile she 'd made , moved the furniture quietly , found the Old Genius under a chair . The case was cracked and Enid had tried to fix it with glue , so everything was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told me she loved me when I was changing the channels to avoid an old or unpleasant commercial .  | Jack the Ripper and I became friends . I greeted him in the hall , smiled : it took a while but he began to smile back . Soon he started slapping me on the back and invited me for a beer at Scooter 's , a bar next to the Barber 's . Jack the Ripper turned out to be a truckdriver and a deeply religious man . He showed me the bills for his electronic equipment  --  a tape recorder , amplifiers , tuners , speakers , and some other stuff that was all chrome and majestic dials . His apartment looked like you could fly it to the moon . Jack only uses the equipment on Christmas , Easter , and his birthday , when he plays the Longines Symphonette Society 's great moments in music album and goes into a monkish swoon . On his birthday , two weeks ago , Jack invited me to listen to the music and share a bottle of sparkling Burgundy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of it and we drank it out of crystal glasses . When the music was over , Jack came out of the swoon , blinking away the tears . " That 's fucking beautiful , " he said , " that 's the real thing . Not like that crap you get on the radio . " Jack the Ripper saw me to the door . " Thanks , Stargell , " said Jack . " For sharing this with me . " I shook his hand . When he smiled you could see the creases in his scars . " Will you listen at Easter ? " said Jack . " If you 'll let me , " I said . Jack filled up his glass with sparkling Burgundy , closed the door , left me in the hall . As I climbed the stairs I could hear what was Jack 's favorite , the " 1812 Overture . " He  | explained to me that his version had real cannons in it , and I heard them banging away . I knew he sat in his chair that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he swooned , felt himself drawn into the music 's slugof-booze warmth . His scarred face smiled at the cannons . Happy birthday , Jack . Say hello to Chopin when you see him . The next morning I saw carpenters putting plywood into the frame of one of the windows at Scooter 's . On the sidewalk there were the dark stains of dried blood , long triangles of glass , pieces that looked like cross sections of icicles . Scooter was watching the carpenters , and he told me that Jack the Ripper had thrown a tourist , a man from East Eighty-first Street , through the window . Scooter is about five ten , a man who wears " snappy " clothes and stylish glasses . He wants to join a country club and then he 'll think he has it made . He looks like a bug with a layer cut . Jack the Ripper had been sitting at the bar , saying over and over to Scooter , How come I 'm getting old ? How come ? I do n't feel no older . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equipment costs a fortune . A fucking fortune . Jack sat there , brooding , and the tourist from East Eighty-first Street came in , cheerful as a sunrise , and Jack reached out and squeezed the guy 's shoulder . " I heard the collarbone snap like a broomstick , " said Scooter . " Then the next thing I know it 's raining glass . Some people from out of the neighborhood should watch where they drink . " 45  | I looked at the broken glass , the ink-blot stains on the sidewalk , and thought , True , true . " Remember , Stargell , " said Scooter . " I did n't say anything bad about him . " Scooter meant Jack the Ripper . " When you see him you tell him he can do anything he wants in my place . Anything at all . Usually he is n't , you know , so vociferous . " Scooter smiled when he said this : he 'd been doing some word-power building on the sly . Stargell , I thought , this is a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the winner will drink on the house . I stand in the shower , listening to the artificial thunder , the rumble of the tin stall . Enid is still asleep . Well , well , I think , unemployed again . I have a sandwich with hot mustard for breakfast , read yesterday 's paper , get my mail , bills marked " Final Notice . " Soon , Stargell , I think , they 'll be beating on the door . How will that make Enid feel ? Hours pass . Enid hangs on to sleep with a pipe-wrench grip . At four-thirty I become alarmed , begin to think that Enid might do herself some harm . Brain damage seems to be a possibility . Stargell , I think , maybe Enid was bitten by a tsetse fly . She shakes her head when I try to wake her , but then submits when I promise her beer . Enid walks through the living room and sits down at the table . She looks like she 's been shooting smack . " I had a strange dream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beer and drink . " Hey , " says Enid . " That 's mine . " I pour her some beer , too , into a tumbler with a foamy residue on it .  | " Did you ask last night about driving extra hours ? " says Enid . " No , " I say . Enid flares , drinks her beer . I can see the coals were just smoldering under the ashes , the gray dust of sleep . " Were tips good last night ? " says Enid . " No , " I say . " Why did n't you ask ? " says Enid . " I did n't get the chance , " I say . Enid fills her glass , smolders , drinks . " I 'll bet that 's not true , " says Enid . " I know how you are . " " How am I ? " I say . " Bad , " says Enid . Stargell , I think , you 've played right into her hands . Both of us smile . " I got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You what ? " says Enid . " I got robbed , " I say . " They took my money . " " Oh , " says Enid . " That 's too bad . " It 's all for the best , since I was just begging for a piece of the ranch . Someone was going to give it to me , too . I think for a moment of Cowboy . " Maybe they 'll feel sorry for you , " says Enid . " Maybe they 'll let you drive extra hours . " I look at the floor . " I quit , " I say . " What ? " says Enid . " What about the rent ? What about my father ? " Enid breaks into the old boohoo . I touch her but she recoils as though I had dropped something slimy on her . This big-league crying cheers me up , because I did n't think Enid still had it in her . Things ca n't be so bad after all . If it had been me they 'd shot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I always knew he 'd do something like this . What am I going to do now ? "  | " Look , " I say . Enid closes her eyes , boohoos , only stops to hiccup and sip beer . " They shot some guys at the garage , " I say . " They did n't shoot you , " she says , " did they ? " She 's my wonder : mind like a steel trap . " No , " I say . " Well ? " says Enid . " You know what I made last night ? " I say . Enid shakes her head . Her tears are as thick as baby oil . " I did n't make one fucking cent ! " She looks like she caught her finger in a rattrap : hurt , surprised . Enid trembles , recoils . My hands are waving around in the air , picking at one another , jumping on the table . This is it , Stargell , I think , we 'll stay right here , Enid crying , me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and kind words . I would n't mind a little advice from the rescue handbook , the sound of a gravelly voice , the look of a sniper 's sure gaze . " You 're being bad to me , " says Enid . I nod my head . " We 're poor , " says Enid . " That 's right , " I say , " we have n't got bean one . " I subscribe to the car crash theory of life : take as much as you can head on and pray you walk away from it . When I started to drive a cab , Enid wanted to know if she could be sued for any damages I did . " You did n't tell me we 'd be poor , " says Enid . " It 's just as big a surprise to me as it is to you , " I say . " What about my father ? " says Enid . " He 'll see us for what we are , " I say . " But I do n't want that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I say . Enid wants to rub the old country 's face in it . She wants to say , You see , I 'm beautiful , we live on heavy cream and  | caviar . Her father 's eyes will be as big as bowling balls , and he will treat her with respect . " I 'll get some money , " I say . Enid takes a handkerchief from her sleeve and gives her nose a nice blow . " How much ? " she says . " Five hundred , " I say . " We 'll be able to show Ari a pretty good time on that . " Enid fingers her handkerchief . " My mother did n't want to have me , " she says , as mournful as a student of philosophy . " When her time came she would n't even lie in bed . She had me squatting in the middle of the room . " All right , Stargell , you pinchpenny . " How about seven fifty ? " I say . " That 's better , " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes , " says Enid , breaking into a heartfelt smile . " That would be best . " She dries her eyes , puts the handkerchief back into the sleeve of her robe . Enid pulls back the curtain , looks at the jaundiced light of the air shaft , smiles . Her eyes fill with tears again and she says , " That would be wonderful . " As I walk down the stairs I listen to the arguing of the unemployed . The tenement is like a shelf , or a library , of useless people . They do n't know it yet and they 're mad . I like the rising sound of their voices , the thundering of men with deep chests , the quick words of women with beautiful mouths . Maybe , Stargell , I think , today 's the day the social worker is going to take it on the ear . Maybe they 'll paste the bastard right on the kisser. 49  | " Sal , " I say to the Barber , " you 're going to be feeling great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sits on his stool , sips his coffee . He looks strangely Arabic today , as though he were sitting in the center of a shop the size of a telephone booth . He 's drinking his coffee from a demitasse and his finger is curled so perfectly that I would like to hang a coat on it . Smiling Mary looks like she 's just swallowed a cockroach . Her bruise is wearing out , although the Barber would n't need much encouragement to improve on his handiwork . " I ai n't feeling so good this afternoon , " says the Barber . Stargell , I think , death will never take the Barber by surprise , since he 's always looking for it . This hypochondria allows him moral lapses that are forbidden to other people . The Barber thinks , I 'm dying , so fuck you . " Look , Sal , " I say to the Barber , " I need money . " The Barber raises an eyebrow with a flourish . " Ah , " says the Barber . " Stargell needs money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the freezer filled with M-16s . I notice the Barber works with his right hand . Smiling Mary only has a bruise on the left side . " Yeah , " I say . The Barber wheezes , sits as though he were in some languid trance , sniffles . The pink-and-white neon sign in the front window makes a buzzing sound : the Barber keeps it for sentimental reasons since the beer it advertises has gone out of business . " How much do you want ? " says the Barber . I take the stool on the customer 's side of the counter . The Barber 's still in a half trance , his eyes still as dull as  | dusty marble . He speaks sloppily , and his voice sounds like someone walking with a boot filled up with water . " A thousand dollars , " I say . " Stargell , Stargell , " says the Barber . " You ought to be ashamed . " Smiling Mary swallows , almost chokes . You can see she wants to throw herself down on the floor and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to listen to the Barber in the pulpit . " A thousand dollars , " says the Barber , " a thousand . " " That 's right , " I say . I feel myself perk up : it 's like the old days , Stargell , when you thought you could tell the Shah to eat shit . The Barber rises , too . For a moment he lets the mask drop , lets me see what his friendship is . When he smiles I can hear thumbs snapping all over town . " How long do you want it for ? " says the Barber . " A month , " I say . The Barber nods . " Look , " he says , " I 'll sell you a carbine . You can go up to the bank . " The Barber chuckles and Smiling Mary puts her hand on her sore kidney . I shake my head . It would be great , though , to take some hostages and issue demands . Maybe I could trade Enid for a Parisian beauty . Enid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sit around and talk about Pascal . " No , " I say . " What do you want it for ? " says the Barber . " It has to do , " I say , " with international trade . " I feel like the pharmacist is explaining to me in front of a bunch of teen-agers how to use an ointment for an itch . I blush . " International trade , " says the Barber . 51  | " Yeah , " I say , " like between here and Greece . " " In-laws , " says the Barber . " Stargell , my heart goes out to you . " In the cooler behind the Barber 's head I can see the cheerful cans of soft drinks . There was a soda pop company that hired the think tank to promote the recycling of cans . I tried to convince them to build a plane out of old beer and soda containers . I see it as a biplane , its skin made from a quilt of Coke and Seven-Up and Budweiser labels : Tuborg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air . I 'm at the controls and the plane flies through the reddish air over Pittsburgh . I can feel the awkward shudder , the nauseating vibrations of the flattened cans . " You 're a great man , Sal , " I say . " Sure , " says the Barber . " Everyone 's a great man when you want to borrow a thousand dollars . " " Wise , too , " I say . The Barber rises to this like a cat that wants to be petted . " It 's going to be five for six . Two pops a month . " Gad , I think . The Barber is n't kidding . I think how wonderful Enid will feel . Maybe she 'll get out of bed and we 'll go for a walk the way we did before we were married . " That 's four hundred a month , " I say , " just in interest . " The Barber turns into an Arab again . Smiling Mary has an auto-da-fe sincerity . " Take it or leave it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trembling fingers , her glad smile . " We 're in business , Sal , " I say . I slap him on the back and he spills some of his coffee . " What do you think this is , " says the Barber , " the stinking Kiwanis ? "  | Smiling Mary glides through the room as if she were filled with greasy ball bearings , picks up the cup , and disappears . I hope Smiling Mary has an M-16 of her own , just to keep the Barber on the up and up . She brings the demitasse back with a little bit of coffee in it , just a touch , but the coffee is strong enough to dissolve rubber . " Here , " says the Barber . There 's a contraption of some kind under the counter and the Barber works it with both hands . He pushes toward me a dusty , heavy pile of money . " You 're thirty short , " I say , after leafing through it . This surprises me , since the Barber seems above short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the look of a hypocrite who , for once , is firmly in the right . " Your number , " says the Barber . " I put in your number for the next month . " Prospects , too , Stargell , I think . Things are really moving now . " God go with you , " says the Barber . " I 'll see you in a month . With the fucking money . " I take the date of the day of judgment without batting an eye , to show I 'm as responsible as anybody else . Enid will get out of bed and we 'll eat fried squid and stand in Grand Central , just to feel the space . Enid will giggle , hold my arm , and say , You 're a treasure , Stargell , that 's what you are . " You know Torre ? " says the Barber . He means Jack the Ripper . " We 're the best of friends , " I say . " You know how he got that electronic equipment ? " says the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm beginning to have my suspicions . " He got that electronic equipment by collecting for me  | from deadbeats who owe me money , " says the Barber . " See you in a month . " Smiling Mary lets her face twitch happily for a while . The Barber looks like he 's going to sell some rugs today . All he needs is a turban and a long clay pipe . Once in the think tank I had to meet the assistant director of the CIA , a man who looked like the picture on the label of a bottle of Old Grand-Dad . He was in charge of " dark work " and I could feel the dead souls rustling around him . " You be polite to him , " said the Slasher . The Slasher 's idea of a good time was a light show and an enema . He had discipline and a high IQ . Old Grand-Dad had come to the think tank because he was selling timber off some land he owned and wanted to be sure the logger was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ double marking arrangement ( each tree marked twice , once with blue paint , once with some stuff that was only visible under ultraviolet light ) . If Old GrandDad found a stump that did n't have both marks , he 'd know he 'd been cheated . I explained this to him in a restaurant . " Yes , " he said , " oh , yes . " He laughed . We drank a lot . " You 're a nice young man , " he said , " and here 's my advice . Wear a Brooks suit and do whatever the hell you want . "  | I climb the stairs to our apartment . " Here , " I say to Enid . The money is spread on the table before her . Enid looks at me as though I had just escaped from a polio poster , begins to cry . " What 's wrong ? " I say . Stargell , I think , it 's a happy end . " It 's just dirty loan shark money , " says Enid . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say . " Thank God , " says Enid . She continues crying warm tears which drop onto the bills . " You do your best , " says Enid with a kind of noblesse oblige . She thinks she 's in a movie , but I do n't mind . Enid , of course , decides to spend the money . If she had thrown it away I would have been insulted and probably would have smacked her so hard it would have sounded like the Ringmaster cracking the black whip . Enid sits at the table , staring at the bookshelves , picks at some balsa wood from the glider I 'm building : it looks like the skeleton of a large bird . I like to put the Japanese silk on the frame , to feel it become taut as a drum . I know what Enid is thinking of our prospects , of the time when she was filled with hope . She still remembers the day a Nobel Prize winner called to speak to me . " What 's happened to you , Stargell ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I say , kissing her hands , the tears on them . " I really do n't know . " Not that I care . Things are looking up , Stargell , I think , and do n't you forget it .  | We prepare for Aristotle 's arrival . Enid gets out of bed at noon , which is an improvement . We open windows , clean house , wash the clothes . They were getting a little rank , but now sheets and towels , shirts and trousers , smell of Clorox and soap . The house smells of ozone from the vacuum cleaner . I think we should leave the dump alone , though : polishing it up somehow makes it worse . It has the feeling of a man combing the last of his hair over his bald spot . A week passes . I buy cut flowers . We go to the supermarket , where Enid gets frightened , but we make it through the shopping list . Greek specialities are in the oven , being baked for Aristotle . " Do you think it looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room . " Fit for a king , " I say . Enid has made some cushions : she does this with the same enthusiasm she gives to her toothbrush and Q-tip work . When her difficulties first began , the apartment looked like a warehouse of gaudy pillows . Sometimes I think there 's some connection between Greece and Fourteenth Street . The new cushions could have been cut from a bullfighter 's vest . Enid blinks at them , gives them a satisfied motherly pat . " Maybe it 'll be O.K. , " says Enid . She 's not seeing the place clearly , and that 's for the best . A jolt of insane crying now and Aristotle might get violent . I polish up the TV . The living room has a cheerful countdown atmosphere , since Aristotle should be arriving any second . " How about a little beer ? " says Enid .  | She 's wearing a silk dress which has been scorched by the iron , and her fingers are stained with nicotine , but her hair is clean and brushed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ servants , Queen Anne chairs among the plants . " No , " I say . " There 's some in the icebox , " says Enid . " Yum . " " Aristotle 's going to come , " I say . " He would n't mind , " says Enid . " I really love him . " She stares at me with her half-smile , speaks with an accent , but I gave up being charmed when I could n't get her out of bed . " I know , " I say . " Then let 's have a little something . " She goes to the icebox , pours out two glassfuls . This gentility is a sign of her love for her father . Once I came home from driving the hack and Enid was tipping a bottle of liquor straight up . " At least , " I said , " you could put it in a glass . " " No , " said Enid . " This way you get as much as you want . " " You remember when we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the memory : it 's as though she had something tasty in her mouth . She flinches when I take her hand . " What plans we had , " says Enid . I was going to be a film director , a politician , a mogul , a circus clown : just thinking about it gives me the kind of chills you get when someone steps across your grave . Stargell , I think , the city has n't seen the last of you yet . Enid closes her eyes . " Oh , " she says . " Oh . " She starts on the ouzo . " That 's for Aristotle , " I say . " I really miss him , " she says . 57  | We sit quietly for a moment , listening to the sound of the lamb in the oven . " You and I were nice to one another , " says Enid . " We made love under the skylight . You remember ? " Enid acted like she 'd escaped from a nunnery , and I 'm still pretty sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things . The city protected us . Even the bums were fantastic . I saw one digging in a trash can , where he found a bunch of rotten bananas . He was drinking a diet soda . He held the bananas and looked up at me and said , " Look . A whole bunch of bananas . I need bananas because I have n't got any teeth . " He started to cry tears of joy . Once , late at night , we were the only passengers on a bus , and we sat in the back , huddled together , watching Central Park slide by . The driver could feel it , too , our youth , dreams , visions . He let us off on the West Side . Enid takes her ouzo in small , quick jolts , then drifts for a while , closes her eyes , smells the spinach pies and lamb in the oven . " Baby , baby , I love you , " sings Enid . It 's a wonder what a little cash will do , I think . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottle it would have been thrown out the window of a car moving at seventy miles an hour . She breaks off , stumbles over the words , then rights herself and comes out of the tunnel of confusion singing a bouzouki song in Greek . I do n't know the words , but it does n't sound happy . I can see Turkey shimmering in the heat , can smell the harsh hashish . Veiled women beckon . Enid takes another slug . " We were all right then , " says Enid . Enid is sending signs , personal smoke signals , and I know she 's getting ready to blow her top , just like Krakatoa . She weaves a little , stares at me with a wavering , inconsistent expression .  | " It 's just dirty loan shark money , " she says , " from that terrible man in the grocery . " " The Barber 's not so bad , " I say . " Yes he is , " says Enid . " And my God . The slut he lives with . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to defend Smiling Mary , but Aristotle 's going to arrive soon . Let 's keep everything mellow for Aristotle . " What are we going to do for money ? " says Enid . " I 'll get a job , " I say . " What can you do ? " says Enid . " You 're just worthless . " " I 'll get a job , " I say . I relish the prospect , the outcast feeling , pounding the pavement in my gray suit , the one in which I was married . I 'll hold a copy of the paper , folded to the classified ad section . " I 'll look in the paper , " I say . " The paper , " says Enid , as though she were a champion who had been offered a match with a bum , a real plodder . She turns up her nose . " If that does n't work , " I say , " there are my inventions . " I tell her about my salami slicer , make drawings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Enid sighs into her glass . " You do your best , " she says . I take the lamb and the spinach pies out of the oven , and Enid sails along , drinking and humming . She stands and dances , then strolls around the apartment , straightening things , looking at me with the same expression she 'd have if she were trying to find my picture in a pile of mug shots . Our rooms have that baking , warm , just-from-theoven odor . The paint on the ceiling is curled , chipped , delicate as an ancient scroll . Enid turns on the radio , pokes at our furniture .  | " I should have been an acrobat , " she says . I agree . " You do n't believe me , " she says . " I do , " I say . " I 'll do a flip , " she says . " I 'll do it like they do in the circus . " " I believe you , " I say . Enid wants to prove her theories , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't you be bad to me , " she says . " Sit down , " I say , " sit down over here . " " Do n't you touch me , " says Enid . She lets out a scream that makes me squint . I think she 's been bitten by a snake , that Jack the Ripper has come through the door , that her underwear is filled with leeches . There is the faint ghost of her voice in the tinny hum of the shower . Enid stops screaming and begins to leak tears that are as clear as ouzo . " You 've got to be good to me , " says Enid . " I 'm depressed . " She says " depressed " as though it were a brand name or a nationality . " You 've got to take care of me , " says Enid . " Will you take care of me ? " Enid breaks out the old boohoo and gives it a run for the money . She 's cried so hard that it looks for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her eyes , so hard that I find myself thinking of the corner of a windshield in a cloudburst . Enid is small ( actually , she 's a little stunted : maybe she 's right to accuse me about the milk ) , but she makes up for it with noise and movement . She cries so hard that she gets the hiccups . I try to reach out to her , to comfort her , but through the hiccups and tears she says , " Do n't touch . . . me , me . . . you . . . you ... scum . . . scum bug . "  | Enid sits in her chair for a while , leaking like a broken pipe , and then she gets up and goes into the kitchen , where she has another slug . Her dress is a little wrinkled , but she does n't mind , since we only have a small mirror that acts as a kind of porthole on your face . There is , however , the smell of scorched silk about her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frenzy , walks back to the living room , sits down opposite me . I can see that she wants to look dignified , and she pulls it off in a drugged sort of way . The hiccups stop . " I feel wonderful , " says Enid . There is a hammering on the door , not as loud as Jack the Ripper 's pounding , but one that still sounds like someone in the hall means business . When Enid stands up she does n't realize that she 's falling over , and her ramrod posture makes her fall like an ironing board . I catch her before she does herself an injury . The pounding continues . Enid turns to me and is about to say something , but then decides against it . She looks as though there were a mouse in her mouth , running back and forth , from one cheek to another . Enid opens the door . Aristotle stands in the hall . He 's about forty-eight , stocky , broad , and he looks grim . Aristotle has a hound's-tooth coat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strangely luminescent . He 's balding , and what 's left of his hair has been dyed red . Enid and Aristotle jabber at one another in their language and it sounds to me like a parrot in a garbage disposal . 61  | " Father , " says Enid in English , with her onstage voice , " what 's happened to your hair ? " " A friend , " says Aristotle , " gave me a potion to stop baldness . It turned my hair red . " He smiles as though he had grown a tomato and it had won a prize . " So this is your husband , " says Aristotle . I give him a firm handshake , the **30;962;TOOLONG grip , and I stare into his ( regrettably ) recognizable gaze . He takes my measure twice , his eyes moving up and down as regularly as a railroad signal . I 'm braced , just like a cadet . He has a military bearing , a pleasant smile , fatherly concern for Enid . I seem to pass muster , but not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes the dump in with one look and does n't even flinch . I like the old fart . Stargell , I think , maybe we 'll get smashed together and go to look at the belly dancers . Enid closes the door and erupts , turns into a human Roman candle , makes liquid fireworks : she vomits all over the kitchen . Aristotle and I make a move toward her but she turns to face us , still squirting , in convulsive throbs , still shooting a warm , acidic fluid . We jump back . Enid tries to say something , but it sounds like she 's under water . Aristotle and I stare at her in amazement , since we 've never seen such vomiting before . I 'm tempted to sit and watch , but Enid looks like she 's going to break something . I grab her , hold her , stroke her hair . She stops , but she 's trembling and gasping for air . I wash her face in the kitchen sink , gently dry it with a towel . " Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sits in the living room . " How dare you , " says Enid , just before falling asleep . I have her in a groom 's lift and I carry her past Aristotle and into the bedroom , where I make her comfortable .  | She 's already snoring the hinges out of the door . Stargell , I think , at least the booze swept her through the whole performance before she had a chance to boohoo for Aristotle : she looked just like someone getting sick . I did n't get a chance to see if Aristotle had his forty-five . I go back to the living room . Ari has found the Barber 's present , the green shirt . " This is a nice shirt , " says Ari , holding it up to the light . I can hear his fingers crinkling the cellophane , trying to feel the fabric . " Would you like it ? " I say . " Me ? " says Ari . I rip open the cellophane , hold it up to him . " It 's perfect , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notice a little spring in his step , as though he were a peacock trying to balance himself with his tail feathers spread . He glances at the bedroom . " Is she all right ? " says Aristotle . " Sure , " I say . " Could n't be better . Aristotle looks suspiciously at me . " It was the excitement , " I say . " She gets excited . " Aristotle glances at the bedroom and then at me . Stargell , I think , the man 's as lucid as crystal . His red hair looks like the dye for it had come on a flying saucer : it 's an unearthly , metallic color . Vanity , vanity , I think . The man wants to be young . He wants to have hair on his head . I want to shake his hand : at least he is n't taking the kick in the chops without putting a little lotion on his head . " Would you like some lamb ? " I say . " You have a lamb ? " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on strings . " Just out of the oven , " I say . " And spinach pies , too . " " I have a bottle of retsina , " says Aristotle .  | He takes the bottle from the bag and gives it to me . I carve the lamb quickly , and with a flourish . Aristotle nods , approves . There are roast potatoes in the pan and I put them into one of the ugliest dishes in the world . It 's made out of green glass and whatever 's inside looks like it has spoiled in a jungle . The table is set , but I spend a moment or two cleaning up after darling wife . " This is good lamb , " says Ari . He 's right , too . We eat with survivors ' appetites . As a matter of fact , it 's so delicious that I think about waking Enid , but then decide against it since she 'd just be insulted . Nothing like a little home-cooked food , Stargell , to set the compass . Ari does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : his cheeks are full , moving . He smacks his lips and has more wine . " Ah , " says Ari . He smiles at the joint . I carve more meat , and we eat again , finish the last of the potatoes , the juices in the pan , the last spinach pie . Ari gnaws a bone , the leg of the lamb , while I bring out the ouzo . The wine is gone . The ouzo was in the freezer and it 's so cold it makes my nose ache . We toast one another 's health . I toast Enid . Ari toasts her mother . We toast the lamb . " I have come , " says Ari , " for a product . " This is the way it begins , I think , all the greats started this way . John D. , Howard H. , all the money heavies . Here we sit in a Portuguese tenement and Aristotle is looking for a product . " I 'll help you , " I say . We toast my assistance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about some belly dancers ? " " Belly dancers ? " says Ari . " You have them in the city ? " Ari 's already standing up , looking for his coat .  | " Belly dancers , " he says . " Yes . " " Are you tired ? " I say . Ari gives me a look that would wilt a cactus . Stargell , I think , you should remember that he has dyed his hair red because he was getting old and going bald . " I slept on the plane , " says Ari . I check on Enid and find that she 's snoring , happy , calm . I leave a note for her in case she should wake and I give her a kiss , too . It 's best to do it when she ca n't complain . Stargell , I think , there it is . There 's the relic . I see Ari sticking the forty-five into his coat pocket . " For the thieves , " says Ari with the natural air of a man who is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but maybe they 'll settle for a gun . Who knows ? I put on a coat , gently close the door . Ari and I stand in the hall , under the dim light bulb there . We descend and I see our shadows collecting in fuzzy pools at our feet . I hail a taxi , pray the driver does n't recognize me , since I do n't think Ari would understand . The driver has the look of a double-shift zombie and he does n't care about anything . He drives so fast the hack trembles . It reminds me of my best times , when the city was greased , slick , open , when the lights beckoned , when a hack was running so well I could feel the pistons tingling in my fingertips . Ari is bouncing from side to side , holding his hair over his bald spot . I 'm so excited I want to climb into the front seat and take the wheel . My foot is on the floor . 65  | " Do you think he 'll kill us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but not much : he 's a veteran of hand-to-hand combat , the death willies , his own crackpot enthusiasms . " No , " I say . " Everything 's all right . " " They 're worse here than in Athens , " says Ari . I bite my tongue , but I was about to scream , Athens ! What the hell do they know about driving a hack in Athens ? The old fart might be hurt by this , so I keep my mouth shut . Especially since he 's carrying the forty-five . We move west on Fourteenth Street , pass the closed stores , the goods ( actually , the products ) that are imprisoned , held behind bars and harsh metallic nets . The avenues tick off : Fifth , Sixth , Seventh . When we come to Eighth , the driver crosses to the south side of the street , into the oncoming traffic , so that he can make the turn . The hack seems to shudder , quake : it makes a sliding motion that takes us from side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can see the sine curve in the lights , the easy wave as the signals change ahead of us . " Do you mind if I take a few of these lights ? " says the driver . He means the lights that are turning red . Take them , I think , take them ! " He should slow down , " says Ari . I look concerned , bounce from side to side , but I 'm just trying to see the street ahead . It 's as deserted as a shopping center 's parking lot on New Year 's Day . Shit , I think , let him go for it . " You go slow , " says Ari . I think Ari 's screaming , but I ca n't tell , because the cab sounds like a trash compactor . My foot pushes against the floor , and I 'm thinking , Give it the gas . My admiration for Ari has soared . I knew he was n't  | going to take this lying down : he 's got the forty-five out and he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The cab is still shuddering , trembling , making a chirping sound as it flies over the potholes . I do n't think the driver got near eighty . Well , Stargell , maybe this man should n't be on the streets . Ari does n't look like a shooter , but it 's better not to take any chances . " Slow down , " I say , " for the love of God ! Slow down . " Even I am impressed by my voice , its urgency , the sound of blind panic . The driver turns his zombie eyes toward me and they are as flat and the same color as a pewter plate . But there 's something in them , a bright scratch of recognition : they settle on Ari 's forty-five . " I always thought I was going to die like this , " says the driver . He puts it to the floor . " Do n't shoot , " I say to Ari . Ari and I feel the car speed ahead , its strange lifting quality . There ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think . I am impressed when I see the speedometer slapped all the way over to the right . " Eighth Avenue and Thirty-eighth Street , " I scream . I can see the driver 's hands tighten on the wheel , the Grand Prix straightness of his arms . The lights rush toward us , spread to both sides , become long streamers in the night before they disappear . " We want to go to Thirty-eighth Street , " I say . " I 'll kill him , " says Ari . The engines misses , and I can see the driver shake his head , can see his lips mouthing the words " fouled plugs . " Just to save face , something I understand , the driver puts the hack into a four-wheel stop : we slide up to the intersection of Eighth Avenue and Thirty-eighth Street like an 67  | elephant on ice skates . I put some money in the cup , grab Ari by the arm , pull him out of the taxi . " Come on , " I say . The sirens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lights : the police cars are small but quickly moving celebrations of the Fourth of July . The lights are red , white , and blue . The hack driver wakes , tears away the zombie 's veil . You can see he does n't know where he is or how he got there , but he 's sure that the police are after him . The cab takes off and I can feel the wind as the police pass by . Ari puts the gun away . " I am a guest in this country , " says Ari . I nod , but I 'm still trembling . " If I were n't , " says Ari , " I would have behaved differently . " The distant sound of bouzouki music fills the empty street . Ari and I stand underneath an awning that has on both sides palm tree letters and they spell out " Club Nile . " Ari is already swaying gently from side to side , smiling like the old hound he is . The bouzouki music is a little mournful , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Ari is thinking of the belly dancers of his youth . We go through a door upholstered in green Naugahyde , and climb the stairs . Ari goes ahead of me , stalks the music , and I can see his purple pants and brown shoes . Ah , Stargell , the old boy 's still got some fight left in him , I think , he 's not played out yet . The stairwell is filled with smoke and the odor of damp skin , talcum powder . The  | bouzouki music is electrified , as soothing as a tin drum : it 's just what we need . At the top of the stairs there is a large room , its ceiling supported by pillars or beams that have been dressed up to look like palm trees . There are tables among the pillars , and there are women with lots of hair and bright dresses sitting with men who look like they 've got the world 's lard market cornered . The men are large and bald and alert . In the middle of the tables and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bandstand is decorated with palm trees , too , and the musicians are playing their odd-looking instruments . The belly dancer is in the center of the floor , and she shimmies from table to table . Ari is transfixed . The belly dancer is about thirty-five , voluptuous , dressed in a spangly costume . The room has the strange sense of loneliness that exotica brings . I can see her undulant skin , the fantastic movement of her body . Ari shouts , screams , is getting ready to stand on the table and applaud . The bouncer , a young man who leans against an imitation palm tree , puts his hand into his pocket . The belly dancer recognizes the shout of a true believer , of one who appreciates her skill , her perfect contractions . She stands before Ari , shimmying , bringing us into her faint odor , her presence . " This is the seduction , " says Ari . We drink ouzo , watch the dancer . Ari takes a bill from his wallet , licks it , and sticks it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think , it 's not many who can handle a belly dancer . She stands next to me , and before I have a chance to look into her remote eyes , Ari pulls a bill from his pocket and shoves it at me . " Stick it on , " says Ari , making a quick , encouraging motion with his hand . " Stick it on ! " 69  | I lick the bill , push it against the woman 's cool skin , feel the hum of the music in her flesh . The band seems to strain and then she is gone , and I am left with outstretched fingers . Ari is laughing . He slaps me on the back . The dancer kneels , but the back of her head is on the floor and she stares into the fronds of the plastic palm trees . Her stomach makes an odd lapping motion . She stares again , shimmies once around the room , and then the music stops . Ari is throwing money at her , at the musicians , shouting and applauding . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it strikes , Ari is behaving himself . The lights come up and the fat men and their women with acrylic wigs sit quietly under the imitation fronds . The musicians pack up and leave , too , and we are left in the forlorn and almost empty room . The fat men and their bought women withdraw as regularly as the tide . I enjoy the rank atmosphere , the smoky , tired air . " Do you have a job ? " says Ari . I shake my head . My fingers are buzzing where they touched the belly dancer 's skin . " No , " I say . " I have n't got one . " " Enid wrote to me about some ... " Ari searches for a word , digs through dictionaries , tries to be delicate , then says , " Expectations . " He smiles because he 's found the right word . " All bust , " I say . " Oh , " says Ari . We finger our glasses . Ari gives me a sly smile , then looks at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shrewd one , " says Ari . " You are biding your time and thinking of a product . " " Yes , " I say . Stargell , I think , the old jackass is a mind reader . " I knew it ! " says Ari .  | The waiters are making small stacks of quarters at the table next to ours . When I turn back to Ari , I see that he is looking at me from under his brows and that he has that same sly smile . " Such shrewdness , " says Ari . I sip the last of my drink , smell the air , the stale perfume and sweat . Ari still has his **32;994;TOOLONG smile . " My wife had a large dowry , " says Ari , " and when I was finished with the army I went into business . I was not shrewd . There are thieves in the world . " Ari says this with such personal regret and outrage that I want to tell him I 'm sorry . " Thieves ! " says Ari . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but this does n't seem to be the time . " I can see we 've both had experience , " says Ari , " that we are shrewd men . There 's no reason to worry . " Stargell , I think , there 's no need to be a wet blanket . I slap him on the shoulder . " Yes , " says Ari . " My wife was upset . I have mortgaged the house , the last of her dowry . Now she will see . " This sounds like sound policy : after a certain point , a thing is worth having only if you can fit it into a suitcase . Or a shopping bag . Eighth Avenue has an after-the-fair quality : it 's quiet , deserted , damp . Ari and I walk north and I can feel the street as it rests , as it becomes ready for the day 's trucks , cars and buses , hand dollies , the angry voices and red exhaust . 71  | Ari is exultant , as incandescent as someone who 's come up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He smiles and sways in time to the memory of a bouzouki song . We pass a woman in a blue wig and Ari turns and speaks to her . She is wearing a short black skirt and ripped stockings . Ari has a horrified expression on his face , but then Blue Wig shrugs and says something and Ari looks relieved . " I 've got a deal here , " says Blue Wig , pointing to a door beneath the stoop . " We do n't have to go to a hotel . " Blue Wig is wearing a short skirt even though there is still snow on the ground . She has high cheekbones , a beautiful nose , eyes through which you can see a coal mine . Ari and Blue Wig go into the door beneath the stoop and before it closes I can see a bare bulb and a cot . There 's a bunch of junk beneath the stoop , beer bottles and candy bar wrappers , but Blue Wig has swept them to one side of her door . I know she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who 's thrown a bottle there , that she says to herself , The place got to look nice a little . People like that . The sky is overcast but beginning to lighten : it looks like gray cat fur . I think about Ari , Blue Wig , Enid sleeping in our bed , about the days when she was full of spit . Ari and Blue Wig climb the stairs ( after about five minutes : Stargell , the woman is a pro ) , and linger for a moment at the sidewalk . Blue Wig looks about twenty dollars happier . Stargell , I think , it would take about five hundred to make her smile and I 'd give it to her if I had it , just to see her face . I 'd like to do it at about this hour , or maybe a little later , at dawn , when the sky is a gold band shell in the east , when the sun has risen . She 'd think I was crazy , but it would be worth it : Blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking the other was crazy . Maybe  | a big truck would come by , too , and the pavement would tremble : the light would break on the bleak walls . " So long , " says Blue Wig . Ari waves as we get into a cab : we move downtown as smoothly as though we were traveling on silk . " I 'll find a product , " says Ari , as he gets out of the taxi in front of our building . He is still smiling : he remembers Blue Wig , the belly dancer , the flight across the Atlantic . Maybe it was the jet engines , the sense of speed , the humming push of flight , or the music , but for whatever reason , Ari pulls out his forty-five and starts shooting into the air . The slap and whoosh of the gun makes me think the street has exploded , that we 've stumbled into a private assassination . It sounds like someone beating an airplane hangar with a baseball bat : Barn . Barn . Barn . The muzzle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The sky is still purple , the color of dark squid , and Ari is emptying his forty-five into it . For a moment it seems that someone is returning the fire , but it 's just a distant echo . I grab Ari 's arm and pull him inside the building . He is laughing and trying to reload . I ca n't explain that the neighborhood is filled with lunatics and that they are armed . The Barber 's sold over a hundred M-16s and everyone keeps his handy . What would be better , I think , for one of the neighbors than popping off an early-morning Greek ? " Where have you been ? " says Enid sleepily . " Having a good time , " I say . I give her a kiss . " Did my father enjoy himself ? " says Enid . 73  | " Yes , " I say . " That 's nice , " says Enid . She rolls over and goes back to sleep . Ari and I drink beer at the dining table . The beer is cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was captured by the Germans , by some of the think tank boys . Jolting Joe would have approved . There 'd be a place for them at our shop . Ari sees the Genius and turns it on . I leave him before the ashy light where he worships his past . There 's a movie on , a Richard Widmark marine epic . The men speak too fast for Ari to understand , but he attended the war college in Georgia , so he gets most of the tactics right . I undress in the bedroom and climb under the covers . " Do n't touch me , " says Enid . I listen to the Genius , hear Ari reload his forty-five . I think of the woman in Paris , of Barbeau , and begin to drift : the night wraps around me , pulls me into its warm and tender embrace . The women with fat arms work the winches in the air shaft , put out their clothes to dry . It gives the building a nautical aspect , as though we were at sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course is set , all the sails are trimmed . It 's above freezing today and I can feel the streams and rivers , the oceans gladden at the warmth , can feel them swell before it . Enid rises , looks at me , and falls back to the pillow . " I do n't feel well , " she says . " I 'll bet you do n't , " I say . " You are my darling , my booze swiller . " " Oh , " says Enid . " Oh . "  | I find Ari sprawled on the beartrap bed , dressed in his underwear , his hand on his forty-five . The bedclothes look like he dreamed of dinosaurs and rabid hounds . His strange hair is in disarray and you can see his bald spot . The Genius is off , looking ( I suppose ) with a gentle understanding at Ari , and the forty-five . I 'm just glad Ari did n't plug a TV Jap . Ari wakes with a start , then slowly closes his eyes , lets me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is one of the best hangovers I 've ever had : everything is alive , twitchy . I give Ari some cold juice and I bring some into the bedroom . " Oh , " says Enid , " that 's too cold . " She puts it on the floor and holds her head . There 's no need for pretense now that Ari and I are friends : I shove the dishes from last night 's meal against the wall and give him his coffee cup in the cleared space . He 's still a little shy or ashamed , so he pats his Martian hair , holds it over his bald spot , refuses to look at me . All gloom , Stargell , sinner 's morning . Underneath it all the old goat is proud of himself . In a few moments he is savoring his coffee , pursing his lips , squinting in fantastic memory . He sees me smiling , chuckles with a quiet selfincrimination . " I 'll find a product , " says Ari . No , no , I think , let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belly dancers , liquor and dissipation . Just think , Ari , what memories you 'll have when they put you out by the ocean , dry as a raisin , to die in the sun . Enid comes into the room , braced and rigid : she 's got a grip on herself that 's going to leave bruises . " Good morning , Father , " says Enid . " Good morning , Enid , " says her father . They give each other a peck and Enid collapses , falls into her chair and sits with her legs spread a little . I give 75  | her some coffee , and then the two of them savor the brown muck , each lost in spotty memory , alcoholic residue . Enid sees that the kitchen 's clean , and this confuses her a little , since she 's half convinced she made her splashy departure there . But she bucks up , pushes on like any would-be aristocrat . " Where did you go last night ? " says Enid . " To see the belly dancers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expression : she does n't like it when I am entranced by women . Once I went to a showing of photographs of nudes and Enid tried to make me sleep in a plastic garbage bag . " They 're so vulgar , " says Enid . Thank God , Stargell , I think . I remember the sweat , the rank music . We drink our coffee . " Do you know anything , " says Ari to me , " about a machine for one man that flies ? " I describe the think tank version , an engineering failure that 's crippled half a dozen men . So far the only good that 's come out of them is that one was used in a cigarette advertisement for a magazine , in which a test pilot , dressed in functional clothes ( all silver and buckles , zippers and hooks ) , a helmet , and weird-looking boots , is relaxing after a jump across a rice paddy . He has the cracked smile of the stylishly insane . " Yes , " says Ari , " that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring to my country . " He 's as solemn as the Pope . I can see it , too , his vision of Athens , of the Acropolis , the musky olive trees , the dust of the cement city . Over it are men in small back harnesses that have two little arms with which to steer , and coming down from each aluminum rucksack is a flame as blue as the Aegean and yellow as gold . The men are float-  | ing over the city as though it were covered with a large transparent trampoline . Everyone going to work or play . At rush hour the city is domed with people , jammed shoulder to shoulder , each with a flame coming from his back . The people who walk carry umbrellas made out of tin foil . The strong women make the winches screech . " It 's in the experimental phase , " I say . Ari looks a little disappointed , but his eyes are still glazed at the prospect . " I 'll keep you posted , " I say . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sing in the air shaft as they work the winches : their songs are in Portuguese and they are laments . Enid hears them , looks relieved , smiles . Ari and I go over the subway maps and I show him where the department stores are , explain about express trains , the buses , taxis . " Macy 's , " says Ari , " Korvettes , Bloomingdale 's . " Ari climbs into the shower , hums , then dresses in the green shirt to go with his purple pants . He puts on his hound's-tooth coat , takes maps and instructions , his briefcase that 's the size of a suitcase and filled with pieces of paper he 's ripped out of old copies of Mechanix Illustrated and catalogues from Frederick 's of Hollywood . " I 'll see you later , " he says . He waves , smiles , closes the door . Enid gets back into bed , sighs with an almost beatific satisfaction , pulls the pillow over her head , and falls asleep . 77  | I do a little shopping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " How 's the import-export business between here and Greece ? " says the Barber . " It 's beginning , " I say . " It 's beginning . " " Glad to hear that , " says the Barber . I stop at the mailbox : there are some notes from bill collectors , each one as shrill as a sawmill . There is a letter , too . I throw the notes away and think , Stargell , you are big game for the bill hounds , or like some rare and almost extinct butterfly that can only be found in Central Africa : they 'll need a safari to get you . I can see the topees and bush jackets , the shiny bearers carrying boxes , the delicate nets . I carry the letter upstairs , into the quiet apartment . The envelope is addressed in a handwriting that I know better than my own . Each letter looks like it had come out of a copybook , a grammar school pamphlet where there are neat rows : Aa Aa Aa Aa . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter says , things are hard now . Your father is not doing so well . He was mad a lot of the time . I would try to find nice things for him to eat but he would n't eat them . He would get angry and say it does n't taste good . I looked for lamb chops . He always liked lamb chops but when I cooked them he would n't eat  | them . I made some soup , finally , some vegetable soup like I used to make when you were a child . You remember ? He ate that . He ate bowl after bowl and then I figured out why he would n't eat the lamb chops . He could n't swallow . Do you see ? I looked all over town but it was just that he could n't swallow it . I think you should come to see us soon . T sit in the gray light of the air shaft and look at the letter . The women sing , pull the winches . Stargell , I think , she loves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's as stubborn as gravity . Cancer 's dragging him right into the ground . Carrots , celery , white onions , potatoes , beans , a tomato , a bay leaf , broth : soup . Stargell , he can still feel the hot juices , can taste the vegetables . He eats it with a spoon from a cup . Perhaps he has a slice of toast with the crusts cut off . I walk to the subway station and take the A train , get into a car that is filled with newspaper people ( each carrying a copy of the Times , the News , or El Diario ) , students , a girl with beautiful legs , a man with a bamboo cane . I work my way to the front of the train , where I can look through the porthole and see the cool , expectant tracks . We make local stops until Fifty-ninth Street : short runs , subway lethargy . Newspaper people get on , sit down , keep the print so close to their noses they seem to be smelling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than reading them . After Fifty-ninth Street the train makes a straight run to 125th Street , and I stand with my face against the glass and feel the car slamming from side to side , it 's highballing coal-tender smash and thump . It seems that the train rises as it makes its ex-79  | tended rush into the tunnel : the minelike supports move quickly , jump at the sides of the car , and disappear . I push my face against the porthole , watch the light on the shiny rails ( clear and cold : untroubled ) , feel the passing of the underground forest , the regularly spaced timbers . The driver is in his booth and he has the same view I have : he must be thinking , I 'll give it a little more . Give it a little more , I think . A little more . The cars are banging from side to side with such cheerful ferocity that I can feel my bones . I want the driver to open it all the way up , to hold the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the side of the porthole , hammer on it with a fist , get ready to scream , Give it the gas , Jack . Let the tin can rip . But I can feel the speed die , the gentle drifting away from the sense of the crest , the driving force , the train 's shot weight . The passengers are relieved that the train has stopped and they fold their newspapers . I cross to the other side of the station and wait for the downtown train . The tunnel is cold as an icebox : winter lingers here , makes its arctic presence felt . There is metallic dust in the air . After a moment I can feel the station tremble , and then the light is smeared across the rails . When the front car stops I go inside and stand at the porthole . A woman comes into the train and takes a seat . She has curled platinum-colored hair , a short skirt , high-heeled shoes , lovely legs . She is wearing a short imitation-leather coat . Her lips are red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a magazine with insane headlines . The train starts and this time the door of the driver 's cab is open and I can see the driver as he sits before the throttle . We move into the lighted space , pass the timers , gain speed . I push my forehead against the glass and feel the slamming of the cars . We move through the tunnel , jerking from side to side . There are lights on the timbers and they blink from yel-  | low to green . The door of the driver 's cab swings open and I can see his hand on the throttle . " Give it a little more , " I say . He looks at me , closes the door , but the train jumps . I can no longer hear anything aside from the sound of my thoughts , which meshes perfectly with the banging and trembling of the train , since it seems to me that my thinking is now done with words that are being ripped , one at a time , from sheets of tin . The subway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a train made of smoke . It is blown away from the driver , me , the one round light . For a moment I look at the young woman , at her squirmy beauty , the almost mathematically perfect curve of her legs , her insolent , garish lips which are pursed in concentration as she reads an article entitled " Phrenology and Sex : What Your Head Lumps Tell You . " I can feel her presence , her vulgar health , as the entire train becomes as ethereal as a comet 's tail , luminescent , ghostlike , dissolving . I can feel the pressure of the speed and then even the banging and slamming seem remote , only remembered . The train pulls into the station . Lamb chops , I think , lamb chops . At an underground stand I eat a stale doughnut with a jelly center and sip a cup of coffee . The crowds have rehearsed for years : not one person bumps into another . On the street there are fantastic women , beauties who have come out for the brief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Their fragrance , their lips and hands , the curve of a breast , a hip , blend into the false spring , the thaw , the blinding speed of the train . In the sealed atmosphere of the apartment , I sit at the table and look at my mother 's letter , then tear it up and throw it away .  | Enid is still asleep . I stand at the side of the bed and watch her twitch . " Time to wake up , " I say . I whisper against Enid 's ear , her soft hair , and she recoils as though I had slapped her . " You leave me alone , " she says . " You ca n't be sleeping when Ari comes home , " I say . Enid stirs , rustles in the sheets , shakes her head beneath the pillow . " You are a brute , " she says . I make some coffee and sit in the living room . Soon Enid rises and drifts , in her pink , childish nightgown , through the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one hand , turns up her nose at the coffee , shields her eyes from the air shaft 's dead-man 's light . " What strange dreams , " she says . I reach out to her and she lets me take her hand . Stargell , I think , what 's this ? I can feel a blood rush , lightning desire . I try to keep the lechery out of my smile , try to show my concern for her . There 's hope for us , my boy , I think . " Germs are getting in my underwear , " says Enid . Enid has a severe expression and she is staring at the icebox , thinking about the beer bottles inside . " We ca n't have that , " I say . " No , " says Enid . " We ca n't . " I go into the bedroom and open a drawer in her bureau . Her underwear is lined up , neatly spaced and folded . Stargell , I think , let 's face it : this folding and storing job is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next to me , looking into the drawer as though there were  | a child inside who had just had open-heart surgery . I 've already done a nice , tidy job : the drawer is lined with plastic . " Do n't touch them with your hands , " says Enid . " O.K. , my darling , " I say . " Do n't you worry about it . " I reach for the laundry bag , but she shakes her head . " That 's dirty , " she says . " There are germs on it . " " I 've got what we need , " I say . I bring a new garbage bag into the room . Enid approves of its slick sterility , puts her underwear inside , watches as I close the sack with a piece of papered wire , the kind of thing you use to stake a tomato plant . Enid gets dressed and we walk downstairs and up the street to the laundromat . I put the underwear in a washer and add enough bleach to make it disappear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is a bench in the laundromat for people to sit on , a comfortable one with slats , but Enid wo n't sit on it because she 's afraid something will climb up her pants . Aside from us , the place is deserted , and we walk up and down before the gently swaying machine . There is the reassuring odor of soap and bleach . Enid takes my hand , squeezes it , gives me a peck on the cheek , and says , " You wo n't tell anyone about this , will you ? " After the underwear has spun , I take it to the drier and give it enough heat to kill anything that Enid knows about . I have n't got the heart to tell her there are bacteria that live in boiling water . While the drier turns over and over , like some amusement park ride for midgets , Enid paces , holds her hands behind her back , breathes deeply in the laundromat 's air . I take the underwear out of the drier and we go home with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my back . We spread another garbage bag on the bed and Enid folds her underclothes and stacks them neatly in her drawer . " There , " she says .  | She smiles as if the drawer were a flower bed in early spring and the daffodils and crocuses had just come up . Enid wears big underwear . I think of small trumpets , the yellow petals , trembling in April 's wind . " I love you , " says Enid . We go back to the living room and have a couple of quarts . " I have to go to California , " I say . " Of course you do , " says Enid . She smiles , looks as happy as when she is wrapped in a warm towel , one right out of the drier . " I 'm beautiful , " she says . " Everyone says so . I 'm intelligent . " Enid and I sit quietly together . She smiles , holds my hands . For a while it is like the old times . I reach across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She laughs , tells me secret fantasies , plans . I have an easy touch , a sureness that any lecher would give a leg for . Enid responds , becomes coquettish , looks at me through her lashes , makes me a fan of her Parisian-fog act , her **40;1028;TOOLONG sensuality . I can see the ancient itch in her glance . We go into the bedroom and sit , side by side . Be gentle , Stargell , I think , do n't scare the poor woman . I slowly rub her hands and arms , caress her cheek , kiss her along her hairline . Enid breaks into tears . " Oh , " she says . " Oh . I do n't know what I 'm going to do . " I 'm getting twitchy now , I think , no doubt about that . " You 'll be O.K. , " I say . " I 'll try some other time , " she says . " You should wash your hands . They should be clean when you touch me . " We go back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I love you , " says Enid , as though she has won a beauty  | contest in a cow county : she wants to make sure all the hicks know how graceful she is in accepting their cheap trophy . A little later she bites her lip , looks at me , and says , " I really do , Stargell . That 's the problem . " There is a distant crashing and banging and then a strange rustling outside the door . Enid looks to me for a sign , since she wants to know whether she should hide in the bedroom . It sounds like someone wrapped up in newspaper and tape is thrashing around in the hall and thumping against our door . " It 's Father , " says Enid . I open the door and there are two piles of packages , one carried by Ari , the other by a man who looks like a taxi driver . No two of the packages are the same size , but all of them are wrapped in brown paper and tied with the string @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the floor and shouts . The driver is a little less exuberant , but he gets rid of his packages , too . Even he seems amazed , infected with Ari 's overheated enthusiasm . The driver takes his money and clears out after shaking Ari 's hand . Ari looks as though he saw Jesus at Macy 's . His red hair is pushed away from his bald spot and his clothes are wrinkled . There is a button missing . from his hound's-tooth coat . Stargell , I think , the old boy 's seen it all . His mind is as stuffed as a ballot box in a crooked election . The packages are everywhere , on the floor , table , sofa . They make me feel like a color-blind man at Christmas . " What things I 've got , " says Ari .  | He pats his hair and blinks for a moment . I pour him some beer , which he drinks in one draught . " Ah , " says Ari . He wipes his lips with the back of his hand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the floor , rips through the wrapping paper , and holds up a pogo stick . It has creamcolored handles and a cream-colored tip . " What is this pogo stick ? " says Ari . " Is it a medical appliance ? " It does have a certain prosthetic quality , the hint of what 's to come : the geriatric walker , the aluminum cane . Stargell , I think , maybe they should throw out all that junk in the old people 's home . These will do . Everyone will hop to the stewed prunes and the Jacuzzi bath . " No , " I say . I take the pogo stick into the hall , since I do n't want to rub Jack the Ripper 's fur the wrong way , and begin to hop . Enid and Ari stand at the door , watching , critical , each trying to judge the Mediterranean temperament , the depth of the future market . The pogo stick makes a satisfying sound , a steady spring and thump . Ari is thinking , and I know he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are thousands of people and everyone is on a pogo stick , hopping like mad . People sit at cafes , and everyone has a pogo stick , parked like a crutch , next to his chair . Enid and Ari have only their noses stuck out the green door of our apartment : altogether I can see two noses and two eyes . In case of trouble they want to be able to disappear . I bring the pogo stick back to the apartment . " Not bad , " I say . Ari throws the pogo stick aside , mutters in his language . I turn to Enid with a questioning glance . " That 'll fetch the little beggars , " says Enid . " He means the children . "  | Ari rips into the packages , tears brown paper : he produces a face steamer , a lawn trimmer that cuts with a plastic whip , an electric carving knife , some Astroturf , a Veg-O-Matic . " A Veg-O-Matic , " says Enid . She takes from the kitchen a bunch of carrots and begins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a sawmill that cuts up carrots the size of redwoods . Enid has an earnest expression , the kind of squinting you see in the face of someone who is trying to read the Ten Commandments off a peanut shell . Ari attacks his packages , exposes knife sharpeners , a pen set , the sound track from a pornographic movie . He has a tape recorder and he slips the cassette in . Ari stands in a stormy sea of paper and listens as a man 's voice says , " Sit on top of me , baby , and talk dirty .... " A woman obliges , and Ari smiles , thinks of Blue Wig , waits for the cassette to end . Enid is chopping . " Well ? " says Ari . " I like the pogo stick , " I say . " It costs too much to make , " says Ari . " That 's true , " I say . " That 's the problem with all this junk , " says Ari . " It costs too much to make . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knife , throws the lawn trimmer against the wall , tears at the Astroturf . That 's it , I think . Who needs this shit ? I kick the face steamer , finish off the lawn trimmer . We sit together at the table and Ari broods . He sips ouzo and looks at Enid . " Stop that chopping , " he says . Enid stops , looks at the ouzo , pours herself a shot . We sit around like Indians at a council of war . What do we do , 87  | I think , when the settlers form a ring with their carts ? Drag burning mesquite bushes ? I have not forgotten their gift : the blankets that gave us the pock disease . Ari takes his head in his hands , squeezes it until the tips of his fingers turn white , sighs . What Ari needs is Jack the Ripper chasing him for loan shark juice . That 'll put a little snap in the old boy 's disposition . " I knew it would come to this , " says Ari @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes upon me . " Burglar alarms , " says Ari . He takes from his pocket a pamphlet that has been read many times . I open the wrinkled front page , which is so fragile that I feel I am about to turn the leaves of a holograph version of the Tibetan Book of the Dead . Burglar alarms are described in the pamphlet . " I want to bring those to Greece , " says Ari . " But we have no burglars there , " says Enid . Ari 's a counterpuncher . Just a moment ago he was stomping the electric carving knife , but he 's back on the track . Enid thinks he 's making reservations for the booby hatch , but I know better . " Yes we do , " says Ari . His eyes are large and blurry : they look like he is examining us through a magnifying glass . He slams his hand on the table . I do n't think he 's slept more than four hours in the last forty-eight : jet lag , Blue Wig @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jungle . Enid jumps back , sips her ouzo . " I will wait for a big crime , " says Ari . His voice rises . " A big one . When a whole family is murdered for revenge . Everyone will be terrified . Everyone will jump when they hear a mouse . Then I will advertise in the newspaper and everyone will beg for my alarms . "  | We sit quietly and contemplate murderers and sneak thieves , prison-break bells , Ari 's firm belief in banking on cruelty . Better cruelty than love , I think , at least as far as coin of the realm is concerned . Ask any dollar apostle , any big-time God man : nothing makes the jack jump like dread . The burglar alarm factory is in an industrial park which is in a town with an Indian name . It 's on Long Island . " Do you know where it is ? " says Ari . He points a trembling finger at the address . I can see the millions of small windows , the bright cyclone fences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parking lots . " Yes , " I say . " When can we go to this village ? " says Ari . " We need a car , " I say . " We 'll rent one , " says Ari . Stargell , I think , you could use a little machinery , a few hundred horses . " Sure , " I say , " we 'll rent the car . " " Tomorrow morning , " says Ari . " Yes , " I say , " in the morning . Crack of dawn . " " Crack ? " says Ari , with his military , eve-of-the-assault diction . He takes the magazine from his pistol , checks it , shoves it back into the butt . No belly dancers tonight , Stargell , I think . Ari opens the beartrap bed , strips to his underwear , and climbs under the covers . I turn on the Genius , search for a war movie , one from Ari 's theater of operations . Enid picks up the products , stacks them neatly against the wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trimmer and carving knife , and then folds the brown paper into neat squares and makes a ball of the twine . Enid 's lip trembles and she says , when smoothing out the brown paper , " Dowry . Poor dowry . " Enid sits at the table . Ari seems restless , unsatisfied by the Genius , tonight 's jolt of the South Pacific , the palmtree marines . He tells me that he had a friend who was terrified of heights , and that he and his friend were being trained to be parachuted behind German lines . They went up in a plane with some other men to make their first jump , and Ari saw his friend foaming at the mouth , shaking his head , screaming . The friend took off his parachute and refused to jump . The other men gave him a raft of shit . Ari frowns at one of his own unkind remarks . Ari was the last to jump , and he looked over his shoulder and saw the friend sitting on the slatted bench , alone , holding his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , swaying from side to side , under the perfectly creased canopy , he heard a wh000sh ! which was made by his friend , who had jumped without his parachute . I can see the moving arms , the aerial terror , can hear the scream mixed with the wind , can feel the puffed , gusty acceleration . Everyone 's falling and then , bang : you hit the bench in the park where you gum your sandwich , just another old fart waiting to have a black umbrella popped in the sun . Ari waves the gun around , watches the movie , eats a lamb sandwich , falls asleep at the credits . I turn off the Genius , have a slug of ouzo , and gather up Enid , who 's asleep on the table . I carry her into the bedroom . " I never wanted to get married , " says Enid .  | I undress her and she turns toward the wall . I take off i my clothes and lie in the darkness of the room , imagine the rush , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old woman in the park or an old man in a greasy spoon and I 'll bask in their presence , in the glory of a withered bag of bones . Enid and I are snug under the covers and I try to put my leg against hers , to touch her a little , since it makes it easier for me to sleep . My foot touches her calf , but she pulls away . I stare into the dark , at the ceiling , the cracks that make it seem as though I 'm covered by one large and white leaf . I can feel myself being absorbed by the mattress . Enid moans in the night . The dreams come off Bellevue 's walls for a while , those visions the painters cover up with latex every couple of years : dancing lamb chops , blunderbusses that shoot slaughterhouse leavings , airplane-crash forests , twisted metal edged with flesh . Those are bad , all right . But then Paris rises and I meet her again , the woman with the eyes that are the color of cognac @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that 's it : I wake to gray blur , morning TV , a staccato sound track . Ari 's up and ready to go . Enid starts , flinches . " Is the building on fire ? " she says . " Do I have to run ? " " No , " I say . She looks at me with an anger that snaps like a turtle . " You 're bothering me , " she says . " Go back to sleep , " I say . I kiss her , squeeze her arm , tell her that I love her . Ari 's chain-smoking cigarettes . I take a shower , listen to  | the splashy thunder and think , Ari , I 'm going to make you rich . I 'm going to take you to the burglar alarm factory . I dress , drink a cup of coffee . Ari is still brooding . " I retired from the army , " he says , " and I sell some shit to make tits big . " The coffee is rich , so strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present business . There are beautiful women in Athens and they are buxom , robust , and not one of them comes near Ari or his stinking machines . Enid told me that Ari 's shop has eaten up everything , aside from the house ( which is now mortgaged ) and Ari 's pension from the army . " Let 's go look at the alarms , " I say . Ari smiles , lets his sun rise . He sees his fortune and it ca n't come a moment too soon . Ari grabs his briefcase and we descend , pass through the layers of morning odors , strong coffee and cigarettes laid above and below stale beer and wine . It 's cold outside and Ari smiles when his teeth chatter : he 's glad they 're not going the same way as his hair . Stargell , I think , this is handy . After a few more disappointments the old goat will start to bite . The car-rental agency has a fly-by-night facade , architecture vague enough to be adapted to any need , from pizza @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cramped room with a counter . The walls are covered with quarterinch veneer : it 's imitation imitation schmaltz . This is the place for us , I think . They wo n't send dunning letters for long , and the massage parlor wo n't have to redecorate . The man behind the counter has a foreclosure expression , a quiet desperation : I have the feeling he wants to ask  | everyone who comes in if he 's interested in a car-rental agency . His wig does n't fit . " Compact ? " says the man behind the counter . Anything , anything , I think . Just give me the keys . But I consider the budget , Ari 's well-being for the next week or so . " Well , " I say . " Whatever 's most reasonable . " Ari stiffens . " I am going to ask to be the European representative , " he says . I approve : seize the opportunity , I think , take the plunge . Who gives a shit if the brochure looks as if it were printed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Great , " I say . " Of the burglar alarm factory . " Only a retired colonel who has killed men with his bare hands can look as proud as Ari . My sun rises , too . Ari , I think , you are a wonder . The rental agent is working on an ulcer the size of a bathtub drain , but he 's dreaming : his plastic pouch is filled with pens . " What kind of big car have you got ? " I say . Ari is improved , although still a little wooden . He gently taps the back of my heel with the toe of his shoe . " Black , " says Ari . " I want a black one . " " Black , " I say to the rental agent . " Cadillac ? " says the agent . He 's smiling now , too . It looks like the poor bastard 's going to be able to buy his lunch today : American cheese on balloon bread , cup of instant coffee . " Limousine , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approval at me , pushes his Martian hair over his bald spot . He 's still as rigid as a stump . 93  | " I 've got a new one , " says the agent a little sadly , " and it 's only been rented once . " Ari gently taps my heel again , blinks . " That would be fine , " I say . " Insurance ? " says the rental man . There must be four hundred horses under the hood . Stargell , I think , can you feel the long black machine , its geared power , its aloofness ? It 's like having a thoroughbred gently reined in , feathered , although ready to break into those long , cool strides . " Stick it on , " I say . Ari stands behind me , now aloof from this tacky business of arranging for our transportation : he seems to contemplate Byzantium , the shape of an urn , the distance of a star , a woman 's quiet orgasmic sigh . I sign the forms , initial the boxes for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so I know exactly what havoc I can wreak ( the damage figures ) , but I know it would ruin the rental agent 's day . " We start you with a full tank , " says the agent . That 's what I want to have : a full tank and four good tires . Good rubber . The rental agent disappears through a door that 's as substantial as cardboard . " Pssst ! " says Ari . He is lounging on the plastic sofa next to a potted plant that is wilting ( Tuberculariaceae fursarium , I 'd say ) , his legs crossed at the knees , his socks collapsed at his ankles . " How do I look ? " he says . Desperate , I think , but nothing a little drive wo n't straighten out . " Great , " I say . The Cadillac does n't arrive so much as it is unveiled : the atmosphere is one that surrounds a rifle being removed 94  | from its carrier . Four doors , bright chrome , black lacquer . " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us as we walk into the street , where Ari stands before the car . I think he is admiring it , and this creates an awkward moment , a slight misunderstanding . Ari sniffs . I kick the tires . Ari clears his throat . Steel-belted radials , good tread . Ari is in a cadet brace . Ah , Stargell , I think , an embarrassment . The gloomy face of the agent is at his window . " I 'm sorry , " I say to Ari . He accepts this apology with a slight dip of his head , then gets into the Cadillac through the rear door I hold open for him . So there , Jack , I think , looking at the flat-tire face of the rental agent , I know what to do . I drive directly to our apartment building . " What 's wrong ? " says Ari . " Is there something wrong ? We are where we began . " " Wait here , " I say . I park in front of a fireplug and run upstairs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , be quick . You do n't want to see the headlines that read " Greek Mafioso Shot in Little Italy . " Enid turns over when I come into the bedroom . " I have to get up , " she says . " No you do n't , " I say . " We 've only been gone a half hour . " " That 's nice , " says Enid . She burrows into her pillow . I change into my gray suit and put on a dark-blue tie : it makes me feel as though I were in my prime , young , graceful , brilliant as an arc lamp . When I come downstairs and get into the car , Ari gurgles and smiles , taps the back of my seat with the toe of his shoe . I have n't got a cap , but that 's no matter : a cap is just some nouveau trash . There 's  | nothing better than having a sandy-haired young chauffeur . Ari understands this , settles back , relaxes . He has a little fan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made out of some acoustical material that looks like the raw sheet from which Band-Aids are cut . I have dials , gauges , swinging needles . The industrial park has an Indian name , a phrase from a dead language , but I can hear it whispered in the tires ' hiss , the escaping exhaust . I go through the tunnel , where the fluorescent lights are ghastly : we seem to be driving through one long tumor . We break into sunlight , onto the open road . After the toll booths , I open it up . At eighty-five the Cadillac shudders . I can feel ( in my fingertips , in my low lizard brain ) a turn 's course : it is a parabola as pure as a mathematician 's dream of the secret of the universe . I slap the Cadillac into it , turn on the radio , listen to the traffic reports , the psychotic chopping of the helicopter blades . All clear for us . The Cadillac lifts , becomes ethereal . Ah , Stargell , I think , blue sky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hey , " says Ari . " Hey . You are going too fast . " I touch a chrome switch and a piece of black glass rises between us : it is like tying a rag around a horse 's head in a fire . The old boy ca n't see where he 's going and that 's a good thing . Ari hammers on the partition . The landscape seems greased with speed , slick . I am a dangerous man , I think , and there 's nothing better . I touch the switch again and put the black glass down . " The roads are great here , " I say . " Better than Greece , I 'll bet . " I can feel the smashed , incandescent heat of the engine , the forced exhaust . Ari is hanging over the front seat , waving his arms . His face looks like he 's just seen a bunch  | of spiders , millions of them , each the size of an Alaskan king crab , running at us with their pincers snapping . Stargell , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the fortyfive . " I am the European representative of the burglar alarm factory , " says Ari . " We must be careful . " This seems a little premature to me , but I see his stricken face , his bulging eyes . " O.K. , Ari , " I say . " O.K. , I 'm sorry . " I slow down , behave myself : the Cadillac moves along at a demure , almost funereal rate . Ari becomes stern again , rigid as a silver-mine Calvinist . I meditate on the beauty of the machine , but it 's not up to snuff : Stargell , I think , speed is the best . Leave Eastern religion to the incense-and-rice drones . " We are men of the world , " says Ari . That 's it , Stargell . That 's what we are . The question is : where do we go from here ? Beyond the sign on which there is an Indian name ( green background , white letters and border ) there is the industrial park : all red brick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with chicken wire inside . Yes , I think , this looks like the eye of the storm : low costs and steady profits . Ari gurgles , combs his hair , straightens his coat with the missing button . I can see the Mediterranean burglars sitting in the sun , their bellies full of macaroni and retsina : they sleep , have visions of colder climes , and when they wake , one says to another , I saw sick snow and a fence and a place that looks like an American motel and a big bell . What do you think it means ? In front of the building there is a covered walk , a ce- 97  | ment path that leads up to a double glass-and-aluminum door . Through the windows I can see that men in white shirts and ties are looking out at us and that they are slipping into jackets , some yellow , some green , all looking like something the Barber might sell . I stop the Cadillac , jump out , and open the back door for Ari , who stands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the air : it smells like burning plastic . I get rid of the car and then run back to open the doors of the burglar alarm factory for Ari . The receptionist is about forty-five and she 's got what I call bobsled looks : going downhill fast . She has on some costume ( or charade ) jewelry , a dress that 's too tight , inspired make-up . She does n't like the fluorescent light . Oh , I think , oh , she 's kicking , too . I want to give the old bat a squeeze , want to say , You 've still got some juice left , some of the old troublemaker . Maybe we could get together and drink gin and tell amazing lies . " Yes ? " she says to Ari . " I would like to speak to the sales manager , " says Ari with a formal , rehearsed air . " Who shall I say is here to see him ? " she says . The receptionist gives Ari her limousine smile , and Ari lets her have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There 's one thing you can say for Ari : it 's no slouch of a name . But the receptionist does n't bat an eye . " The man in the Cadillac is here to see you , " she says into the box on her desk . It 's all I can do to keep from grabbing her right there and giving her a hug : everyone is as flattered as a smalltown prom queen . Ari smiles , shows the receptionist that he still has his own teeth . Oh , I think , oh , she must have been hell in a house trailer . I can see her lecherous smile , her old squirmy gift . She 's good for a while yet , and she 98  | knows it : convincing the people around her is the problem . To the right of the receptionist 's desk there is a waiting room in which there are two sofas and an end table and a lamp . The lamp is made out of a big bell . There are Venetian blinds over the window and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Cadillac . I 'm doing this when the salesman comes into the room . He 's wearing a maroon suit and he 's made a quick stop at the washroom , where he gave his rug a little dusting , a shot of aerosol freshener . He does n't look bad , really , I think . You could say he was the Valentino of the burglar alarm . His stock falls , however , when he ignores the receptionist 's searching glance . I want to grab him by the neck and say , What 's wrong , Jack , are you a zombie ? I give her a nice smile myself , and she 's flattered , but I 'm too young ( to acknowledge in public anyway ) . " Hello , " says the salesman . " My name is Rivers . " Ari introduces himself . They shake hands . Rivers turns toward me with a slightly raised brow . " This is my driver , " says Ari . Rivers dips his wig at me , then turns back to Ari . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We have come , " says Ari with that same rehearsed and formal tone , " to look at your alarms . Do you have a European representative ? " " No , " says Rivers . " Ah , " says Ari . Smiles everywhere . Rivers extends his arm , directs us to the showroom , and his stance , the way he holds his arm , reminds me of a bullfighter 's cape work . The showroom has religious acoustics , silence , the kind of quietness you would expect down in the silos where they keep the rockets and the H-bombs . There are alarms everywhere , 99  | mounted on the walls , sitting on tables : gray boxes , silver tape , bells . Ari , I think , old boy , you 've hit the jackpot this time . Rivers shows us his alarms as though he were a gardener and these were his favorite flowers . There are alarms for safes , doors , windows . There are electric eyes , heat sensors , detectors of voltage irregularities . My favorite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is for a safe : all you have to do is to try to pat the till and the whistles blow . ( The static electricity of your hand trips the bell . ) Ari smiles . I grab all the paper I can , the technical specifications . Ari sees this as assistance , but I 'm thinking , Shit , Stargell , you never can tell when this stuff will come in handy . Same cheap printing everywhere . Logo with small lightning bolts coming out of a rabid dog 's mouth . Rivers brings us up to a row of bells and he points out the twelve- , fourteen- , sixteen- , and eighteen-inch disks . They all look like plaques in the burglar alarm hall of fame . Rivers pauses before one that is almost twice as large as the biggest one we 've seen so far . " This , " says Rivers as though he were about to announce the results of a grudge wrestling match held on chicken wire , " is one we sell to the government . They use it at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall . The bell goes off . It sounds like all the riveters who worked on those buildings in Manhattan had been put together in one room , something like an auditorium , I guess , and they have all been given large trash cans to rivet and they all go to work at one time . I am stunned . It is impossible to think , even to hear , since the ears become oddly numb . Ari 's eyes start out of his head . It is so loud , so physical , that neither of us can do a thing . I feel as if I were standing in subzero weather , my skin anesthetized by the cold . Ari is trem-100  | bling . Rivers lets us have the full treatment . We stand this way for a minute or so and then he touches the button . The bell dies . Let 's buy some bells , I think , some of these big ones . " What do you think of that ? " says Rivers . " What , " says Ari , cupping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think of the bell ! " " I think that 's a good bell , " says Ari . Ari and Rivers go into a conference room with a window in one wall : they look like fathers inspecting babies in the nursery . I am left with the alarms . Ari and Rivers yammer back and forth . Ari rubs his Martian hair , stares for a moment at Rivers ' rug , the hair weave , reaches out and touches it . Rivers looks offended . Ari points at his own bald spot , his hair , shrugs . Rivers seems to warm up and he lets Ari have a gentle tug on the acrylic strands . Ari thanks him , but then he is drawn toward the showroom again . They talk for a while , and Ari nods his head as if to say , Of course . Of course . But I think he 's selling everyone down the river . I feel the lush warmth of the delta , the lash of the overseer 's whip , hear the chains rattle , the insistent buzz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ari alone and Ari pales , so I know they 've come to terms , but even in this serious brush with reality , he is still hypnotically affected by the Minuteman bell . I touch its carefully machined surface , feel the lingering vibration there . It 's clear that the old fool wants to take out his forty-five and celebrate , but even he knows they wo n't stand for that kind of thing in a factory . I move from alarm to alarm and finally get a glance at the receptionist . She looks into her compact , touches her spun-glass hair . What would you give , my darling , I think , to stop the clock ? I turn to the alarms . Rivers comes back into the isolation booth with some 101  | papers and a small steamer trunk or large suitcase . It 's covered with plastic alligator skin and has taps on the corners . Gad , I think , Ari 's put himself on the door-to-door squad . He looks a little crestfallen , but not for long . Rivers opens up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a small window , a small door ( cozy miniatures ) , and they are covered with the silver tape and the necessary switches . There is a small gray box and a small bell , too . Rivers turns a key on the gray box and opens the miniature door ( from which I expect a small man to emerge with a lawn mower ) and the alarm goes off . Ari nods , but he 's not happy with the sound of the six-inch bell , since , in comparison with the Minuteman , it does n't make much more noise than an egg timer . Rivers closes up the case and Ari points out in the showroom what he wants : the safe alarm , the electric eye ( which , with mirrors , can see around corners ) , the quiet police alarm , the smoke alarm , and , with his finger trembling , the Minuteman bell . Rivers works an adding machine for a while , hums , and fills out the official contractual papers he had brought with him . Ari watches with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes a roll of fifties from his pocket , counts the bills off , slaps each one down with a so-long-pal thump . That 's the end of the dowry , Stargell , I think . All that 's left is the map to paradise . Ari comes out of the isolation booth , begins to sweat in the air-conditioned showroom . " I 've got a product , " he says . He shows me the agreements , a letter with the company 's rabid-dog logo . " Look , " he says . The agreement makes him the sole licensee for his homeland . It 's written with a lot of lawyer drivel ( the linguistic correlative of barbed wire ) , but it boils down to  | this : Ari agrees to sell twenty-five alarms or " generate " fifteen thousand a month or the deal is off and Ari forfeits his deposit . Ari is carrying his demonstration kit . " That 's a lot of alarms , " I say . " A big crime , " says Ari , " and they will come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , those people who first refused his attentions , and I am proud of his generosity . Stargell , I think , Ari will go down swinging . Twenty-five alarms a month . I feel a castaway glow , real camaraderie : I 'd like to say , Welcome to the leaky dingy , you old jackass . The water 's warm as soup . Here 's the plastic pouch , some sticky shark repellent . Can you hear the sprinkler hiss of fins , the quiet rush of papers in the bankrupts ' court ? We 'll scream and shout , moan into the last and empty can of C rations , and the sharks will sicken on the lingering eddy of memory , satin thighs , pursed red lips , a beautiful woman . Ari stands in the cool air of the showroom , and he 's got the third-degree sweats . " Axes and knives , " says Ari . " I will give my help to the frightened city . " He pats his bald spot and ogles the receptionist . " Ha , " says Ari @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his free hand as we go out the door , a dying-chicken-wing kind of stabbing motion . The receptionist is talking on the phone , caressing the mouthpiece , touching her hair . Good for you , I think , a personal call . Have a good time , my darling . Do n't be afraid to ask for what you want . Ari sits in the Cadillac , in the front seat . The demonstration kit is in the back . I bring the car around to the shipping department , where the anonymous but strangely powerful boxes are stacked next to the demonstration kit . " I have purchased the big bell , " says Ari , " the Minuteman. " 103  | I chauffeur the alarms , the bell : they ride along as dignified as a Russian prince . " I also know where to get , " says Ari , making a combing gesture with his fingers , " some new hair . " It is noon and the city rises out of its golden haze . It looks like a fortress emerging from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheets of glass , church towers , the harp strings of the bridges . " Slow down , " says Ari . " We have the alarms . " He relaxes , settles into the seat next to me , becomes as certain as a brick . We enter the tunnel , the ghastly light , and drive under the moat , the East River . " Well , Ari , " I say , " what now ? " Ari looks at the alarms , and then at me . A smile takes his face and he squints as though smoke had got into his eyes . " I do n't know , " Ari says with a little shyness . He lights another cigarette . " We 've got the car , " I say . " We do n't have to take it back . " Ari squints at me and smiles again . " You want some hair ? " I say . " A nice new rug ? " Ari shakes his head . " Not now , " he says . He 's still squinting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It goes through my mind like the lightning bolt in the mad-dog logo : I know what he wants . " Maybe we should drive to the other side of town , " I say .  | " Where is that ? " says Ari . " By the belly-dancing place , " I say . " Yes , " says Ari , smiling shyly . " Maybe we could find the woman with the blue wig . " I cross over to Eighth Avenue . Ari starts jumping up and down in his seat , points her out . She 's standing in front of her stoop , smoking a cigarette and looking impatient as hell . She has on her short black skirt and her blue wig . " Pull over , " says Ari . He jumps out on the traffic side . A truck stops short , squeals : the driver blows the horn , says something unflattering about Ari 's mind . Ari dismisses him and crosses over to the stoop . The horns are honking , shrieking : it sounds like a slaughterhouse for machines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the walls , the signs , are weathered , tinted by the acidic rain , the sun . The avenue has the atmosphere of a panicky evacuation . Blue Wig 's recognition of Ari makes her smile sourly . She points at the basement stoop , but Ari shakes his head , gestures toward the Cadillac . Blue Wig is impressed . Stargell , I think , the woman is flattered . She walks toward the car with a healthy , insolent shake of her ass . Before they get in , Ari spends a few moments piling the packages , the bells and alarms , on one side of the back seat . As they begin to get reacquainted , I discreetly put up the partition , but I can hear them back there , grunting and thrashing around . The avenue is filled with cars , trucks , buses , vans , and everyone is screaming . Blue haze rises . Damn , I think , there 's not even enough room for an accident , but then one of the screamers might have a heart attack . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with sooty snow , but I can feel the undeniable tick of spring . I stop when I see a delicatessen , go inside , buy some beer . Yes , Stargell , I think , this is it : here we are in a rented 105  | Cadillac filled with a bunch of burglar alarms and an Eighth Avenue whore . Ari and Blue Wig rustle in the back : I can hear the rhythmic movement of the burglar alarm boxes . Blue Wig says something . Ari lets out a deep , satisfied groan . The back seat is quiet for a while and then there is talking , the circular rising voices . If you could see the sound it would look like a hypnotist 's turning spiral . Stargell , I think , they 're having a lovers ' spat . " I want what you owe me , " says Blue Wig . " No , " says Ari , " do n't do that . " I slide down the partition . Blue Wig has a box and is hitting Ari on his face and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much as to lessen the impact on the boxes . " Please , " says Ari . Stargell , I think , just look at her : mad as hell , her hands gripping the box . She pops the old goat another . " Please , " says Ari . " Here . " He reaches for his wallet , gives her something , and she tosses the box aside . Ari carefully picks it up , shakes it , tries to guess what it contains . " You got to treat me right , " says Blue Wig . " They are well packed , " says Ari , putting his box down , patting the others . Blue Wig is sitting in the back with a victorious expression , one that says , See ? The new roach powder really works . " You should n't cheat people , " says Blue Wig . " I am not a citizen , " says Ari . " I did n't understand . " Blue Wig sniffs , lights a cigarette . I can smell her odor , the acrid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I stop the Cadillac and Blue Wig and Ari get out and climb into the front seat .  | " How are you ? " says Blue Wig to me . " Could n't be better , " I say . " You are married to my daughter , " says Ari , stiffening . He opens two bottles of beer and hands one to Blue Wig , and she takes it with a daintiness that is surprising , her I'm-with-the-quality grip . She puts the mouth to her lips , kisses it while she drinks . " Are you still mad ? " says Ari . " No , " says Blue Wig . " I 'm O.K. now . " When she wants to she can be as mean as a stick with a nail in it . But things are cheery again : smooth sailing for a while . We ride through Central Park and I point out to Blue Wig the trees , give her Latin names ( Quercus alba ) , tell her about xylem , phloem , cambium , the tender membrane where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she says , as though she had milk chocolate in her mouth . We take the turns , look at the buildings on Fifth Avenue , those apartment houses that seem as safe as Boulder Dam . No one says a word . The twitch of spring , the smoky air , Blue Wig , Ari , the alarms , are bound together . Blue Wig closes her eyes . Ari arranges his hair . I hold the bottle next to my ear , listen to the shell roar , and then we leave the park . I stop in front of Blue Wig 's stoop . " Anytime , " says Blue Wig , " you want something regular , you know where I am . " The traffic pushes against us . For a moment it sounds like we 're driving through a horn-blowing and shouting contest . The garbage trucks moan in some mechanical ecstasy . Blue Wig is left behind , drawn into the receding buildings , obscured by the trucks , the hand carts , the pedestrians who never make a false step . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We were passionate , " he says .  | The Cadillac has a certain after-the-party atmosphere . We drive downtown . " Enid does n't seem well , " says Ari . Ha , ha , I think . If you only knew . " She 's going to get better , " I say . Ari glances at the boxes of burglar alarms , then back at me . " You must face reality , " he says , tapping each word into my shoulder . That 's it , Stargell , let 's take the bull by the horns . " I think , " says Ari , " that Enid should have been an acrobat . Her feet were a little frostbitten at the front . Did she tell you ? " " Yes , " I say . He looks at the boxes again as though they were the secret weapon . I stop in front of our building , help Ari unload , then take the Cadillac back to the rental agent , who removes the keys from my hand and gives me a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fading fast , but they 're going to have to take him out with a net : the number on the brochure has been censored and a new one has been written in with a ballpoint pen . Auto-da-fe , Stargell , the man 's a believer . I want to tell him about burglar alarms , but he 'll run across them soon enough , probably on his own , after his course in motel management .  | Motels , motels , Stargell , I think , do you remember the first ? It was in California and I must have been seventeen and the girl could n't have been more than sixteen . She was short , blond , full of that itchy desire . The motel was one of those that have a sign saying , " $8.50 per couple , free ice , coffee , TV , " and it was tucked in a small canyon , back from the freeway , and everyone had a little bungalow , a shack with a screen door . We were embarrassed about our clothes , the big double bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd been smeared with eye shadow , statues of horses . We got down to business . She had never been in a motel before , either , but she said , For a moment it was like there was only the bed and you and me . I want to go to a telephone booth and call the girl , find her fat and married ( or tennis thin , hungry , and divorced ) and fly to her and give her a great fuck ( I 'll bet we 've both learned some things ) just for the pure wonder of it . Then I could say , Do you remember that motel ? Jack the Ripper hears me pass his landing . " Stargell , " he says with a dirty-postcard hiss . The door of Jack the Ripper 's apartment is open only an inch or so and there does n't seem to be much light inside . " What can I do for you ? " I say . " Come on in , " says Jack . His resonant voice comes out of the dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as though he were speaking out of the bottom of an oil drum . I push the door open . Jack is sitting in his chair , staring at the equipment that surrounds him , the chrome , functional-looking amplifiers , tuners , an aluminum mixing console ( with at least twenty plastic levers ) , the green screen of an oscilloscope . " You know I 'm not a diplomat , " says Jack . " I 'll bet you get what you want , all right , " I say . " Yeah , " says Jack . He shrugs , gestures toward the equipment , the cathedral : it 's the cool presence he loves , the ready power , the finished surfaces . " You borrowed from the grocery ? " says Jack . " What the hell , " I say . " Yeah , " says Jack . I look through the window , see on the glass the silver tape , the burglar alarm delineation . Jack 's not taking any chances with his equipment . " I 'll get the money , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still staring at the dials and knobs . " I do n't want to have to hurt you , especially after , you know , we listened to the music together . " Jack puts his fist next to the scars on his cheekbones , those silken webs of flesh . Jacks says " music " the way a nun says " vows . " " Do n't worry , " I say . Jack makes a surprised , grunting noise that sounds like someone had jumped on a large bellows . He shakes his head . " That was n't smart , " says Jack the Ripper . " I know , " I say . Stargell , I think , why not admit the truth ? " Do you ? " says Jack the Ripper . " Do you ? Sometimes I think you are n't as smart as I think you are . "  | " Do n't worry , " I say . Jack makes that same snorting sound , and I know I 've heard it before , at the zoo , in the sound track @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they come up from the bottom of a river , opening their mouths , showing their peg teeth . " I want to be friends , " says Jack , " but you got to get things settled with the Barber . " " We 're friends , " I say , " you and I. " " Stargell , " says Jack as he stares at his NASA oscilloscope , " if you think that 's going to help you when it comes to , you know , what I do for the Barber , I want to tell you something . " " What 's that ? " I say . Jack speaks as though he 'd just sprung the hangman 's trap . " You 're wrong , " he says . I stand for a moment in the cool silence of his apartment : it 's as quiet as a stone cellar . There 's a new carpet on the floor and paths are marked on it with sheets of clear plastic . It makes me think I 'm in the garden of a chemical factory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will you ? The fucking grass is growing up through the Astroturf . Jack the Ripper 's rug is orange . " That 's a nice suit , " says Jack . " I was married in it , " I say . " It makes me feel good just to put it on . " It does , too . We drank cool , perfect champagne . It made the hands steady , the head clear . It was a celebration and Enid looked lovely , and she was filled with a quiet joy , a touching , shy reserve . Nothing happened , really . There were no earthquakes or floods , no natural disasters of the mind . Enid just turned into Edith Piaf , only Enid 's more maudlin .  | " You still going to be around at Easter ? " says Jack . " Yes , " I say . " Are you still coming down , " he says , " to listen to the music ? " " If you 'll still let me , " I say . " Wear the suit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say . " Do n't worry . " " I 'm not worried , " says Jack . " I 'm just a little sorry in advance . " Our living room looks like a small warehouse for burglar alarms and Ari is sitting in the middle of the boxes . I can smell the cardboard and the gluey tape . Ari is quiet , in Pall Mall meditation . Enid is still in the bedroom , and when I touch her she flinches and says , from beneath the pillow ( so that it 's a little muffled , but still distinct ) , " No . " She shakes her foot , and I realize that if she were standing up she 'd be stomping the floor . I stand before Ari again . " How about a war movie ? " I say . " Later , " says Ari . He looks at me suspiciously through the smoke . He 's using a mixing bowl for an ashtray and I empty it , and when I come back he looks at me with that same suspicious expression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conspiracy of one . The steamer trunk with the alligator skin and the metal taps on the corners sits next to him . " Hungry ? " I say . " No , " says Ari . Actually , Stargell , I think , the old skunk looks like he is about to make his first jump .  | " Look , " I say , " I 'll be a customer . " " What ? " says Ari out of his smoky presence . " You can try the case on me . You can demonstrate the alarms . " " Would you ? " says Ari , coming out of the smoke like a bull out of the fog . He straightens his hair , drops his suspicion , smiles . " Be glad to , " I say . " I have been thinking , " says Ari , " how I would convince people of the value of the alarms . " Ari straightens his coat , gives his case the once-over , touches it carefully . Stargell , I think , you ca n't say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character : he really believes in these screwy schemes , in alarms and pogo sticks . This hits me hard , as though someone had slapped me in the face with a fry-pan , but I come out of it all right . " How shall we do it ? " says Ari . " I 'll go into the hall and knock on the door , " I say . Ari busies himself with his kit and I go into the hall and stand beneath the fuse box . I mess up my hair , loosen my tie , indulge myself in a little mean , junkyard dread , find myself pounding on the green door of the apartment . Ari opens up . " Yes ? " says Ari . He speaks as though he 's been soaking in warm oil overnight . I shake his hand . " Mr. Ari , " I say . " I saw the news in the papers . Horrible . What a crime . Chopped up the whole family . Chop , chop , chop . " I make the appropriate motions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes , " says Ari , as though he had been there or ( at worst ) had seen the official police photographs . What a  | cool leech he is , what a conniver . He 's all right in my book . " My wife , my dear wife is so upset , " I say . " She ca n't even get out of bed . " Ari touches my arm , gives me a reassuring pat , nods , looks like an Aegean Freud . " I understand , " he says , trying to draw my attention to the kit . " We have ... " He turns toward the alligator case , the small steamer trunk . Stargell , I think , he 's not going to get away with that trick . " No , you do n't , " I scream . " She thinks the end is near . What the hell am I going to do ! " Ari flinches . " Now wait a moment , " he says . Actually , he 's not bad at this : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staring at the case . " Things have gotten pretty fucking screwy , " I say . Ari makes a kind of yogi hum , a strangely reassuring sound which he probably picked up from the King of Lampur , or the resident Dali Lama , the Himalayan rice man . " You have nothing to worry about , " says Ari . He opens the kit . " All you need is an alarm , " he says . " Yeah , " I say . " That 's it . What have you got ? " He describes ( in garbled terms ) the essence of the alarms , tells me about tape that goes over glass , switches that are installed on doors and windows . " Now , " says Ari . " We will make a test . " He reaches into his kit , turns a switch . He reminds me of someone who 's just discovered alchemy , a pig-shit-intogold heavy . " Open that door , " he says . He points to the dollhouse door . 114  | " If a burglar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well . See for yourself . " I grab the small doorknob , open the door , and the alarm goes off . It is n't very loud , really , not when you consider the Minuteman . " Turn it off , " I say . Ari hesitates for a moment , twists a switch first one way and then another , and finally turns off the alarm . " That 's great , " I say . " You 'd have to be crazy to go into a house that 's making a noise like that . " " Yes , " says Ari . Enid rises , opens the bedroom door a little , peers out at us . " More boxes , " she says . " I have been busy , " says Ari . Enid seems to run on wires : she drifts through the living room ( looking once at Ari 's alligator skin suitcase ) , through the kitchen , and into the bathroom , where she spends a moment or two ( probably hovering over the toilet ) before drifting through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warmth and reassuring odor of the bed . We wait for her to pass as though she were a subway . " And if you have a safe , " says Ari , warming to the pitch like a snake-oil man , " we have an alarm built for it . " I would n't mind having a little money oven , I think . Enid could keep her underwear inside . Ari uses his hand like a hatchet , chops into a brown box . The safe alarm emerges . " Here , " says Ari after cracking open another seal , " is an electric eye . " He laughs , tears into other boxes , shows me the alarms . " You do n't have to worry , " he says . " I feel better , " I say . 115  | I can smell the industrial odor of the alarms , the faint scent of milling oil , the musk of styrofoam packaging . Ari has the kind of smile that usually goes with driving nails into the coffin of one 's bitterest enemy : it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sealing you up . A tidy job , Jack . " Sold , " I say . " But wait , " says Ari . He looks through the opened boxes , the styrofoam balls , sees that there is still a sealed package . " We have another bell , " says Ari . Ari smashes through the cardboard , throws stuff that looks like gray waffles from the box , and holds ( for me to admire ) the Minuteman bell . It is smoother than a discus , three times as large : it makes me think Ari should have a license for it , a kind of gun permit or top security clearance . Ari holds the Minuteman like a trophy , a prize taken in the industrial wilds . His hands are trembling . " That 's some bell , " I say . " Wait until you hear it , " says Ari . Before I can say a word , he 's undone the wires from the demonstration kit . That a boy , I think . Five will get you ten , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No walking from door to door for you , Frog Prince . But Ari surprises me . He works with a quick dexterity , mumbles about using explosives during the war , slips two wires into the Minuteman bell , then pushes a button , and the wires are mounted . Ari throws the main switch and opens the dollhouse door . If sound were an object , this one would be Grand Central Station . The floor is vibrating . The skin on my face feels as if it were asleep . " Turn it offl Turn it off ! " I scream . The bell has blown Ari back into the beartrap bed , where he squints and grits his teeth : he looks like someone 116  | on a rocket sled , taking at least ten G 's . His face sags and his eyes pop with wonder : he 's cracked the sound barrier . " Turn it ofll " I scream , but I have that helpless underwater feeling , a dreamy , slow-moving horror . I see Enid rise and come from the bedroom . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her ears , stomps up and down . The vibration is as distinct as that from a reducing machine : I can feel my chair hum . Enid stands in front of me with her hands at the sides of her head and she is screaming . I ca n't hear her , but I know she 's saying , " You 're being bad to me ! " I notice the apartment door is bouncing on its hinges and plaster is dropping in earthquake puffs from the top and sides of the frame . Stargell , I think , there 's only one man who could hit the door that hard . Ari notices my stricken face and decides he 's had enough of the Minuteman . Enid sits down on the beartrap bed and stomps her feet , and she lets me know ( by her puffed-up cheecks ) that she 's holding her breath . Ari pushes a small red button , one that works a mechanism for holding the wires to the bell . Nothing happens . Ari gives the wires a gentle tug . Nothing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gets mad , stops holding her breath , and stands before me , and when she opens her mouth I can only hear the bell , but I know she 's saying , " Why are you being bad to me ? Why are you being bad to me ? " Ari tugs , frowns . Enid starts crying , throws herself on the sofa , covers her head with pillows , makes swimming movements with her legs . The door jumps on its hinges and its frame is surrounded by the smoky falling plaster . Enid ca n't stand it anymore : she jumps from the sofa , stands before me , slaps my face . " Why are you being bad ! " she says . I go into the kitchen and open the door for Jack the Ripper . He throws me against the shower , walks slowly 117  | into the living room , reaches over Ari 's shoulder and into the kit , turns a key there . The alarm stops . The quietness is as smooth as soft water , refreshing . I wonder how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , holding the family goods ( wrapped in a sheet ) , ready to jump . Ari looks up , sees Jack , the veiny , large , scarred face . Enid is still crying . " That 's a big bell , " says Jack the Ripper . " Yes , " says Ari . Jack looks at Ari 's red hair . " You seem to know about alarms , " says Ari . But this is just a dodge . Ari really wants to get his , hands on the forty-five . " I got an alarm , " says Jack with a modest shrug of his shoulders . " But I ai n't got a bell like that . " Enid sobs on the sofa . " You sell this stuff ? " says Jack . " Yes , " says Ari . " He sells it overseas , " I say . " I am the European representative of the company , " says Ari . " I will begin in the Mediterranean . " Jack nods , frowns because his worst suspicions have been confirmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sell all the good stuff to the Arabs and leave us the shit . " Jack stares at Enid for a moment , and under his heavy glance Enid cries all the harder . Jack walks to the door . " Stargell , " he says . I walk into the kitchen . We stand at the door , where the dust from the plaster looks like someone has spilled a pound of flour . " I know you got problems , " says Jack , " but you got to stop the fucking noise . " The scars on his cheekbones are silky and white . " You understand ? " says Jack . 118  | " Sure , " I say to him . " I 'll do better . " As he turns to go , he looks over his shoulder at the Minuteman bell . " It 's a great bell , " he says . " It 's called a Minuteman , " I say . " Yeah ? " he says . " Like Paul Revere ? " " Yes , " I say . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave neat patterns in the dust and there are flecks of plaster in Jack 's eyebrows . " You heard me , Stargell , " he says , tapping me in the center of the chest with a baseball bat finger . " Keep your relatives quiet . " He says " relatives " with the same tone he would use for " iguanas . " I close the door behind him . Ari is a little trembly , more impressed than ever with his equipment . The bell sounded louder ( if that really is possible ) in a small space than at the industrial park . It is an awe-inspiring sound . I can see the end of the world , the sky scratched by long , perfect cylinders : they look like windblown rain on a window and they are moving fast ( so goddamn fast I get the willies just thinking about it ) toward the flatlands , Kansas and Nebraska , where the spring corn rustles in the wind . Sleek and green stuff . Then the bells ring . The insects stop their quiet nibbling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the heat and light bloom over the fields . " Come on , " I say to Enid . She lets me put my hand on her heaving back . " Is he gone ? " says Enid . " Yes , " I say . I give her a little kiss . I 've got some nice turkey in the icebox , so I say , " How about a nice turkey sandwich ? With butter and lettuce . " " Yes , " says Enid . " I 'm a little hungry . " 119  | " I 'll cut the crusts off , " I say . " Are there any chips ? " says Enid . Things are looking up , Stargell , I think . The woman wants chips . " Yes , " I say . I make the sandwiches , cut off the crusts , make small triangles , and arrange them on the plate : it looks like we 're going to eat a geometry lesson . I put out chips , too . " I 've got to wash my face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the table and wait for her . Ari 's still a little shaky , but he 's getting over the effect of the bell . My ears are ringing , and I sit there , contemplating the sandwiches and listening to the high-pitched hiss . " Ah , " says Enid , after coming back to the table and tasting a turkey sandwich , " that 's good . " " Yes , " says Ari . " Refreshing . " We eat in silence and then Enid and I leave Ari with his boxes and styrofoam . I follow her into the bedroom , where she sits down on the bed and squeezes my hand . " I love you , " she says . I sit down next to her . " I 'm going to California , " I say . " Of course you are , " says Enid . She smiles , and for a moment she is as pretty and healthy as she was in the old days : faintly crooked smile , wet , pink lips , dark eyes , a musky presence that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best , " says Enid . " Yes , " I say . " When you come back you can find a place of your own , " she says , " and then I could come and visit you . " Yes , that 's it . I 'll find a place with a skylight and a fireplace and it will have a view of some trees , a garden . A 120  | child and mother will spend an afternoon there . Maybe there will be tulips in the garden and in the spring they 'll pop up , as bright as a cartoon . Enid could ring my bell and climb the stairs in her raincoat with nothing on beneath it . Enid gives me a real hug . " I 'll be gone a couple of weeks , " I say . " Good , " says Enid . She stares into the air shaft , sees the dirty brick , the black streaks in it , hears the winches squeak . Women are taking in their frozen clothes . The black markings on the stone make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though the women have come into a church to hang their clothes . Enid watches as the frozen long johns , stiff as ironing boards , are dragged over a window sill . Having Ari around upsets Enid , because it means she has to get out of bed before nine o'clock in the morning . Maybe it 's the memory of Macedonia , the lingering sensation of the air blast of an exploding mortar shell , but for whatever reason , Enid does it . She drags herself out of bed as though she had a tail . " God , " says Enid , when she hears the morning television shows . " Oh , God . " She stands in her pink nightgown . My darling is right : morning television just makes me feel like I 'm in a nut house . Enid whispers as I stumble in the dark , trying to find a pair of shoes . " I had a pet deer and I did n't feed it once and Father called me into the yard . This was in northern Greece . 121 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The deer is thirsty . Who has let the deer become this way ? I had , and I told him so . This will teach you , he said . He took out the pistol , the same one he has in the other room , and he shot the deer 's head off . What a mess . " Enid scowls at her father through the glass door , into the video light of the living room . " He did other things , too , " says Enid . Enid takes a cold shower , begins to do sit-ups in the bedroom . Soon she 's running around the block . We eat oatmeal with cream , nuts , brown sugar , and raisins . Enid and I go to the movies . She grumbles at night . " Good morning , Father , " she says . " Good morning , " says the old goat : We drink coffee together , just like people . I can tell that something is gnawing at Enid . I get her to take a walk with me and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where she can watch the cars pass by . In the evening I see her lighting a cigarette with a match from a book that has an advertisement for a driving school on it . " Father , " says Enid . " Yes , my dear ? " says Ari . " I want something , " she says . " Tell me what it is , " says Ari . They sound like they have escaped from a language laboratory . " I want to learn how to drive a car , " says Enid . She holds up the matchbook . Stargell , my boy , she 'll become an American yet . I think Enid needs a big Oldsmobile , a Rocket Eighty-Eight . She 'll escape to California and live in a condominium and go to surfing parties and swap meets . Ari reads the matchbook carefully . 122  | " Do you think they are safe ? " he says to me . I look at the matchbook . There 's a list of features the school offers , and each one has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ controls ( that will cause some fun , Stargell ; wait until the teacher tells Enid to slow down : he 'll get an earful then ) , state certification ( this will come in handy , too ) , full insurance , experienced teachers , new cars . " Sure , " I say . " I want to drive the car , " says Enid . She puts her arms out in front of herself , as though she were holding the steering wheel of a car , turns it back and forth the way old ladies do when they 're nervous . They do n't think they 're driving unless they 're doing something , stepping on the brake or turning the wheel . Stargell , I think , just be glad you 're not going along for this particular ride . " Then we will get lessons , " says Ari . " Thank you , Father , " says Enid . She gives him a peck on the cheek . " Thank you , Stargell , " she says . She squeezes my hand and looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the verge of crying . She 's thinking , I 've got a second chance . Maybe I 'll get a Plymouth . " Voom , " says Enid . The old goat smiles at her . " Which do you think is the superior automobile , " says Enid , " Oldsmobile or Buick ? " She is still sitting at one of the chairs next to the dining table . One foot is up against what she imagines is an accelerator , the other is flat on the floor . One hand holds the wheel , the other toys ( in a professional manner ) with a gear shift knob . " My preference is the Studebaker , " says Ari . He has a serious slash of an expression . " I had a fifty-one , after the 123  | war , a white convertible . It had a radio and whitewalls . " Enid giggles . " Of course , " says Ari , as though he were explaining something of great importance , " I had more hair then . Enid was just a little girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a while . " So it 's decided , " I say . " Yes , " says Ari . " Would you call the school ? " " You call them , Stargell , " says Enid . " You speak so well on the phone . " Oh , I think , you little , charmer , you . No wonder I married you three years ago . " Ace , " says a man with a brisk voice . Listening to him is like taking a whiff of ammonia . We have a quick , refreshing talk . " He 'll be right over , " I say to Enid and Ari . " His name is Frank McGraw . " Enid makes Ari and me wait in the bedroom while she takes a shower . Ari and I sit on the unmade bed and stare into the light of the air shaft , and Ari says to me , " What do you think of this ? " " It 's good , " I say . " Yes , " says Ari . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cigarettes while Enid takes the longest shower of her life . " I must prepare , " she says . When she 's done with herself , she 's slinking around the apartment , swinging her shoulders from side to side . She takes quick puffs from her cigarette . " Once I thought I would be a femme fatale , " she says , looking at me over her shoulder . " I must take a picture , " says Ari . He digs through his weird-looking luggage , picks out a 124  | camera , bangs it on his knee , then pries it open . The camera is covered with imitation skin , so it looks like a small alligator that 's having an autopsy . Ari pokes at it with his finger . Enid is still posing , moving her shoulders from side to side . Someone knocks at the door . " Stargell , " she says , blowing out a quick puff of smoke , " could you get that ? " I let McGraw in . He 's wearing dark glasses and a uniform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ari , and daintily shakes Enid 's hand . McGraw is about forty-five , short . He has a vaguely aeronautical quality , and I expect him to say " negative " for " no . " He also has a gold tooth and big ears . " Have you ever driven a car ? " he says to Enid . Ari and I sit on the beartrap . Ari is still playing with his camera , slamming the lid against its latch , gnawing at the plastic alligator skin . McGraw and Enid ignore us . " No , " says Enid . " But my father is a wonderful driver . " Ari grunts . " Good , good , " says McGraw , but you can see he does n't believe it for a minute . He explains about a learner 's permit , gives Enid a booklet entitled " The Rules Of The Road . " Enid frowns . The booklet has already made her feel excluded . " Study that , " says McGraw . " Then we will take the written test . I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a hundred dollars and it is nonrefundable . " Ari is still chomping on the camera , trying to get the latch to work , but he mumbles at McGraw . " Excuse me ? " says McGraw . " How much altogether ? " says Ari . McGraw twists around in his chair and looks at the two of us as though we were two fops in the Bellevue waiting room , the Mutt and Jeff of Thorazine. 125  | " For everything ? " says McGraw . " The works , " I say . McGraw cocks an ear and says , " Did n't I speak to you on the phone ? " " That 's right , " I say . " Well , " says McGraw , " the whole package comes to four hundred dollars . " Ari bites through the plastic alligator skin , looks at McGraw with the eyes of a retired and angry colonel , spits out the brown hunk of plastic . " You , " says Ari , " are a thief . " McGraw bristles , but then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drop in the bucket of his ulcer . Scream , I think , show the colonel what you 're made of . " That 's not true , " says McGraw . " Ha ! " says Ari . " Stargell , what do you think ? " " It 's a bargain , " I say . " What the hell . Pay him . " " He is a thief , " says Ari . " Father , Father , " says Enid . She 's moving her shoulders from side to side , trying to light a cigarette . She strikes match after match , but the blue sulfur just crumbles at the tips of her sweaty fingers . Always spend top dollar on promotion , I think . Look at that lousy matchbook for the driving school . " Three hundred and fifty , " says Ari . " Four , " says McGraw , stiffening a little . He pushes his dark glasses against the bridge of his nose . " Father , Father , " says Enid . Her lips begin to tremble . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " says McGraw . Stargell , I think , that 's the boy for me . He 's already got his hand out . Ari looks like a lizard has run up the sleeve of his shirt , but he counts out the money , the first payment . 126  | " How about a little practice ? " I say . I can see Enid does n't want to mess around with the learner 's permit . She ca n't even stand the checker at the A &; P , so how the hell can she wait in line at the Departrnent of Motor Vehicles . " She does n't have her license , " says McGraw . " It 's not legal . " " Legal , legal , " says Ari . " You 're the thief . " " Now wait just a darn minute , " says McGraw . " Stop , stop , stop , " says Enid . I light her cigarette . " Thank you , " she says . McGraw sits on his chair , looking at Enid , at the pile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says . " A couple of times around the block . " " That will be wonderful , " says Enid . I can see her getting her first ticket for doing 110 in a school zone . She 'll say to the cop , Who are you to tell me what to do ? I know of what my machine is capable . We go downstairs . Enid and Ari and McGraw go outside and look at the school 's car . The postman comes in and I stop to say hello . He 's a country-and-western-buff postman and he usually sings something for me . He gives me my mail . " How are things ? " I say . " I 'm as happy as a pig in shit , " he says . He gives me " On the Wings of a Snow White Dove , " listens to the hard acoustics of the stairwell . After he 's done , a woman who is upstairs on a landing says , " What are you wasting time for ? I want my mail . You lazy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says , " I 've got to go back to work . " The car is a Duster , and Enid is already behind the  | wheel . Ari kicks the tires . It 's painted a daffodil yellow . McGraw gets in , behind the second steering wheel , and the car goes down the street , its turn signals blinking . " It 's not a bad-looking car , " says Ari . " There are many people in Athens now who have the money for a Toyota . But they do n't know how to drive . " He rubs his head . We wait . I can hear the postman opening the mailboxes , the clop , clop , clop of his sorting . The woman from upstairs says , through the stairwell , " I want my mail , you slimy bastard . You 're putting on airs , are n't you , talking to that man from the next landing . He 's crazy . I want my mail . " Ari and I stand in the street and I can hear the distant but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roar of an engine , the pale , weak roar ( to be sure ) , but a roar nevertheless , of a Duster . It comes down the street with its headlights on and its horn honking . It 's stopping and starting , swinging from side to side . I can see McGraw gesticulating and arguing , and Enid 's giving him what for : the lower part of her face is one quick shudder . The machine lurches , and then I can see Enid spitting on McGraw . He puts his hand on his face , and then the Duster races down the street and smashes through the telephone booth in front of the building and continues right along , taking out the fireplug . Ha ! Stargell , I think , look at the water . McGraw is screaming . The car 's blinkers are still going . Ari and I run up to it and open a door , which takes a little doing , since the fireplug was hit on Enid 's side , and it creased the door . Ari and I give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as can be . McGraw is still shouting . Enid walks right around the remains of the telephone booth and the fireplug . " That man insulted me , " she says . 128  | She goes into the building . McGraw gets out of the car and says , " Who the hell is she ? " " My daughter , " says Ari , bracing a little in the misty breeze . " You can have her , " says McGraw . " What about my car ? " " You are insured , " says Ari . " But she did n't have a license , " says McGraw . " MY insurance is n't any good unless the driver has a license . " Ari shrugs . I shrug . McGraw stands in his wet uniform . " Hell , " says McGraw . The trunk of the Duster is half open and McGraw reaches inside and takes out a tire iron and stands in front of Ari . " You 're going to pay for this Duster , " he says . " I am not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her a lesson , " says McGraw . " I did n't want to . " " Go away , " says Ari . " I 'll sue you , " says McGraw . There 's a little blood on his forehead from the broken glass on his side of the car . He menaces Ari with the tire iron . Jack the Ripper comes out of Scooter 's , walks across the intersection , and says to me , " Stargell , is this man bothering you or your relatives ? " " Who are you ? " says McGraw . " Is this your car ? " says Jack the Ripper . " Yes , " says McGraw . " I do n't want it in front of my building . And look at the fire hydrant . " McGraw is a little dizzy : just a moment ago he had a tidy business , a Duster . Now he 's just another sap who 's fallen into the greedy hands of the insurance company . 129  | McGraw hits Jack with the tire iron . Jack slaps him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the broken fire hydrant . I can see a rainbow in the misty air . " Some people have all the nerve , " says Jack . By the time the police arrive we 're all inside the building . McGraw is taken off in an ambulance . As I pass the mailman he touches my arm , then finishes closing up the boxes . " You know what ? " he says . " What ? " I say . " The old woman did n't get a goddamned thing . " He sings " Silver Threads and Golden Needles Can not Mend This Broken Heart of Mine " as he goes down the hall . When Ari and I get upstairs we find that Enid is preparing for bed . " That man was not a nice man , " she says . " He tried to tell me what to do . " Ari and I stand side by side . I realize that both of us are shrugging the same way . " I 'm going to bed , " says Enid . She closes the bedroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I think , you 've got to get the woman downstairs on a mailing list : tools , down clothes , auctions , antiques . It will snap her light , my boy . She 'll bring the postman a cup of tea and say , Is that bundle there , the one bound with twine , is that one for me , my darling ? The days pass . Ari waits for his exile to end , for the return date on his airline ticket to arrive . One morning I find a letter from my father . His handwriting is functional , precise : every letter looks like a design for a building . 130  | I want to see you here soon boy and I do n't mean maybe , the letter says . Was there anything in your work for the pain ? My father means the work in the think tank . The Stargell was more medical than anything else : my successes came on hospital jobs . After these I hit the moths at full throttle ( bump and wing , the almond heads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work would only give me the best way to bomb Los Angeles . Heat kills , says Jolting Joe , L.A. is perfect for it . Nice megaton clusters , well spaced . Nothing left but the paper work . Ari comes into the apartment , carrying two shopping bags and a small bottle of ouzo . " Stargell , " he says . I go over to the door and see that the bags have come from a secondhand-china store on Sixth Avenue : the place has a dusty odor , the smell of bankrupt hotels and restaurants . Ari has his head bent to one side , his cracked expression . His Martian hair is messed up . " What 's in the bags ? " I say . " Plates , " says Ari . " Come down to the courtyard with me . " Stargell , I think , Ari 's getting more gentle every day . He means the air shaft . We go downstairs , come to the door which leads into the bottom of Ari 's courtyard . I push it open and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his mouth open , then puts down the bag and opens the small bottle of ouzo . We share it , standing in that TV light , and Ari goes through his plans now ( it 's become a litany ) , and I nod , while thinking , Yes , yes , yes . 131  | " Here , " says Ari , reaching into one of the sacks and handing me a plate . It 's a white piece of china , cafeteria heavy . " Like this , " says Ari , taking a plate from one of his sacks . He throws it across the air shaft . Stargell , I think , that 's the ticket . I throw mine , too . And there we are , throwing plates as fast as we can get them out of the sacks , not laughing , not grim , just throwing those plates against the wall . The Portuguese have their noses stuck over their window sills and Enid does , too . From the bottom of the air shaft it looks like a pink mole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apartment and they are now peering down at us . " Father , Father , " she says , " this is America . " " Huh , " says Ari , reaching into a sack , holding his head to one side and breathing through his mouth . He looks at me with such great surprise that it almost verges on suspicion . " You do n't break plates here ? " he says . He wrinkles his nose and squints at me . I 'm still thinking of the wrecking-ball crash the plates make against stone . " We do now , " I say , picking up a navy platter and sailing it ( Frisbee style ) against the streaked wall . The noses stay on their sills until we 're done . " Ha , " says Ari . We finish the bottle and smash that , too . " Now , " says Ari , with a certain diplomatic ceremony , " it 's time for a nap . " As he climbs the stairs to the apartment , I see that Ari has made another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of black high-top tennis shoes , and he jumps a little from step to step , as if he could feel the new springiness. 132  | I give Enid some " household " money and this leaves enough to buy a bus ticket to California . I 'll get two loaves of white bread and a big piece of cheese , some Colman 's mustard , and I 'll sit in the back of the bus , eating sandwiches and watching the country roll by . That mustard will be so strong my eyes will water . The black fields will slip around us as smoothly as a turning record . The dark land will be ready for planting , and I 'll taste the mustard and smell the rich , fertile odor , see machines moving across the fields , dropping seeds the way a turtle lays its eggs . I 'll get an onion , too , and slice it and put it on the cheese sandwiches . There 'll be enough cash left over for a pint , and I 'll drink it as we cross the Mississippi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel the pressure of the sky . I 've got a barlow knife to cut the onion and the cheese . My cheeks will be full and moving as I look out the window of the bus . Ari is reading his technical papers , tracing , with a finger , the lines of electricity through the printed schematic . He looks up suddenly , as though he 'd felt a sharp and sudden pain . " What 's up ? " I say . " Nothing , " he says , although I can see he 's blushing so hard he must be as warm as a wood stove . Occasionally he pats his weird-looking hair and chuckles . I drop downstairs , already feeling the sea-tide swaying of the bus , the prairie-schooner rocking . Might as well buy the bread now , I think . I 'll go to the cheese store for the rest . The Barber 's sitting behind the counter , smoking cigarettes , and challenging his raw liquor to do its worst . 133  | Smiling Mary has a beauty . My advice would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Enough experimenting . " How are you , Sal ? " I say . I squeeze the long loaves of bread . Sal looks a little sour . " Where you been ? " says the Barber . Smiling Mary gives me a look that could skin a cat . " I was at an industrial park , " I say . " What do you think of that ? " " Nothing , " says the Barber . Smiling Mary gives me another one of those looks . The Barber toys with his glass , has a little nip , but he still looks sour . Smiling Mary has on a pants suit . " I 'd of thought you 'd been here sooner , " says the Barber . " I think you 're a great man , Sal , " I say , " but these days I 'm keeping my visits to a minimum . " " Ah , " says the Barber , " I 'm just a grocer . " He loves it , though . The Barber needs his stroking . Maybe one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with a baseball bat . She can tell what I 'm thinking and her face twitches once in acknowledgment . " Here 's what you came for , " says the Barber . " Leave the bread alone . People do n't want squashed bread . " He pushes an envelope across the counter . Smiling Mary nods . " What 's that ? " I say . " Your number , " says the Barber . " Your number hit . " He sighs . Smiling Mary sighs . And in a fit of idiotic politeness , I sigh , too . It 's as though we were looking at a dead canary . " You could pay me half what you owe , " says the Barber . " We made a deal , " I say , putting the envelope in my pocket . 134  | " That 's right , " says the Barber with a click in his voice that sounds like someone shoving a full magazine into a pistol and working a cartridge into the chamber . " I 'll see you in two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue bruise . The Barber 's liquor gurgles into his glass . " Two weeks , " he says . The street is cool and the snow is almost gone . Well , Stargell , I think , you can get a jet . Beautiful women walk up and down the aisles and the whole business moves at six hundred miles an hour . There 's strange food and you can look into the wing and see the mechanical works , the slick hydraulic pistons . Fucking money , I think , filthy trash . I want to throw the scummy slop in the street . Stargell , I think , you 're getting rabid . And it 's about time , too , thank God . I come into the apartment . Ari is still sitting at the table , tracing the flow of electricity . " Things are looking up , " I say . " Yes , " says Ari . But he does n't seem interested . He 's still blushing and patting his head , running a finger around in his bald spot . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I say . " Just think of the lonely women you 'll meet if you start working door to door . " Ari groans . " What 's wrong ? " I say . " Is there something wrong with the burglar alarm ? We 'll take it back and shove it down their throats if they sold you shoddy goods . " That 's the way to deal with an industrial park . " No , " says Ari . " The burglar alarms are beautiful . Look . " He gestures to the sofa and floor , where the alarms sit as if they were eggs laid by a flying saucer .  | " What 's the problem ? " I say . Ari blushes again , blinks , squints , and looks up at me . He makes a polishing motion with one hand at the side of his head . " I 've got a low disease , " he says . " How low ? " I say . " I have a drip , " he says . " You got the clap , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " That 's what I think they call it in your country . " Enid comes into the living room , stands at the door , looks at her father . He is still making that motion with his hand : it seems that he 's trying to adjust an invisible watch cap . Enid has wide , backward eyes . " What is wrong here ? " she says . I shrug , gesture to Ari , who is now smiling , humming a bouzouki song , smoking a cigarette : the cat 's out of the bag , so he dwells on his enjoyment , the sub-stoop lust and satisfaction . " Can you believe it ? " I say . " The old goat 's got the clap . " " Clap ? " says Enid . Ari looks up at her with the most childlike sense of ignorance and says something in Greek : his hands are held palms up as though he were carrying a large platter . " Oh , my God , oh , my God , " says Enid . " Have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , " says Ari . Enid jumps back . Ari reaches out for her . " We 've got to clean the bathroom , " says Enid . " We 've got to boil the sheets . All the towels . " I write the address and telephone number of a doctor on a slip of paper and give it to Ari . " He 'll fix you up , " I say .  | Ari goes on humming , staring at his alarms and his hightop tennis shoes , which are sitting next to the bear trap and which I think he likes almost as much as the Minuteman bell . " Thank you , Stargell , " he says . " Do n't mention it , " I say . He sees me following his gaze to the high-tops . " It 's funny , " says Ari , " but those shoes make me feel like hopping . " He holds up two fingers , makes a small rabbit with his hand . Enid has thrown her heart into it . There are large kettles on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pots where the water is almost ready to boil . Enid stands before them , wringing her hands and waiting . At best she seems skittish , as if she were standing in a flooded room where there was also a live wire . The water boils . Enid pours some of it into a bucket , mixes in Lysol , detergent , bleach , Drano , Comet , and then charges the bathroom . I look in after a moment and see that she 's hard at work with a toothbrush . I . make my reservation , speak to a woman who has a lascivious voice that 's as cool as silk stockings . I pack a small bag and put it in the living room . " I 'm going to California , " I say to Ari . " Yes , " he says . " I know . " " It 's been great , " I say . Ari blushes , looks at his alarms , his high-top tennis shoes . " We are friends now , " says Ari . He stands up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Thank you , " he says . I go into the bathroom and find Enid on the floor , scrub-  | bing and muttering . She keeps her nose over the pail as though the cleaner 's odor were oxygen and she had emphysema . " I 'll be back , " I say . Enid is wearing rubber gloves . She dips the toothbrush into her bucket and begins working on the white bolts that hold the toilet over the drain . " Here 's a little more money , " I say . She takes the money from my hand and I can tell that if she had to take it with her fingers she 'd shove it into the Lysol and hang it out to dry , but the rubber gloves protect her . Enid is wearing a pair of blue jeans , a blue cotton top , a pair of tennis shoes . One hand in a rubber glove rests on the top of the bucket and the other is now moving the brush over the porcelain tank . The tank is clean , white , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " How did he get that goddamned disease ? " says Enid . She is shaking now , crying into the Lysol , still scrubbing the big tooth . " How did he ? " she says . I reach out to her , but she squirms away . " How do I know you have n't got it , too ? " she says . " I have n't done anything , " I say . She turns , shows me her face that 's now as red as a radish , her amazing anger . " But you wanted to , did n't you ? " she says . It would be great . I think of Barbeau , of women I have known . " I did n't do anything , " I say . " Filthy , filthy , " she says . She starts working with the brush again . " You are a freak , " she says . " They should put you in a side show . " " I 'd like that , " I say .  | I would , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big fat woman , an alligator man , the people , the faces going by . Everyone trying to explain miracles . Enid works her way around the lip of the bowl . " Did it feel good ? " says Enid . " What ? " I say . " Wanting to , " she says . Thank God for the old troublemaker : at least I know I 'm still alive . " Yes , " I say . Enid throws the toothbrush into the bucket and I can see the crown-shaped splash it makes . Enid starts the old boohoo and gives it a good workout . " Oh , what am I going to do ? " she says . I squat next to her , look at her swollen eyelids , her red face . She does n't seem to mind when I touch her hair . She gently leans against me and I can feel her breathing , her small gasps for air . " Do you remember , " I say , " the old days , the first winter we spent , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the wall ? Do you remember ? " I squeeze her hand . We get comfortable next to the bucket of brew , the cleaner that would make a subway bathroom sparkle . " I had never seen it snow , " I say , " and there was a blizzard . I thought it was the second coming . Flakes like big pieces of soapy foam . " I start squirming just thinking about it . " We were all right , " I say . " Everything was all right . " " It was a fraud , " says Enid , looking right at me . " I did n't know what else to do . " She sees me recoil , as though she had spit in my face . Her hand goes back to the bucket like a trained seal and  | brings up the foamy brush . She makes a gesture that includes herself , me , the toilet . " It 's just a problem , " says Enid . " That 's all . " Those times linger . I think of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so crisp it was like biting off a piece of fresh carrot . It 's not turning out the way I had imagined : we 're getting old , all right , but not together . " What wonders , " I say . There we sit , holding each other , trembling like a couple of dogs that have been dosed with a fire hose in January . I leave her there with her rubber gloves and her toothbrush . " Have a good time , " says Enid through the bathroom door . I can tell by the jerky quality of her voice that she has gone back to work with the fervor of a convict filing at his leg irons . Ari is sitting before the television and looks a little ill in the gangrenous light . The Genius has a war movie going , and for a moment Ari has forgotten the alarms , the clap , his daughter crying on the bathroom floor . His eyes follow some action I ca n't see . " They 're above you , " he says . " Above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A quick burst of automatic-rifle fire fills the room . Ari seems relieved . He is sitting in his undershirt ( the kind that looks like the upper part of a basketball uniform ) and I see him reach underneath it and stroke the smooth , slick tissue of his wounds . He sees me at the door with my bag and says , " We are friends now . I will not forget . I will keep you apprised of the developments . " I wave goodbye and then find myself standing in the hall , hearing the snap and pop of the television , the  | whine and explosion of a mortar , the shout of the enemy . Downstairs the Barber and Smiling Mary sit beyond the neon advertisement for a beer that does n't exist . They seem caught in the bluish matrix of fluorescent light , like prehistoric insects preserved in amber . The Barber is staring through his window , at the writing on the wall , the garbage cans , a woman who has stopped for a moment and rested her shopping bags @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only movement in the street is her white breath . The Barber sees me and my suitcase , but he does n't care : he 's a believer , an apostle of himself . The Barber knows I 'm not going so far or so long that he wo n't be able to find me . Ah , Sal , I think , you 're a great man . From the air Los Angeles looks like a nerve cell under tremendous magnification : it 's gray and slickly speckled . There are houses in the grain , squares off the fibers , the web of roads . The wing rises and falls as we make a turn over the Pacific , which is misty , as haunting as a recurrent dream . Then I can see the city , the stretching , reaching cell , its color of gray lichen on brown rock . There are small chips of light ( sun-struck swimming pools and automobiles ) , subcellular movement : RNA cars , trucks , buses , motorcycles . I can hear the quick screech of the tires . Reverse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plane trembles , shimmies , and stops . Through the window I can see the white concrete form of the terminal . My luggage emerges from a machine that looks as t hough you could use it to leave the solar system , to travel at unbelievable speeds beyond the galaxy . Through the 141  | window I can see the African hills , the brownish growth on them , the first hint of spring . Women are watching the airplanes , the large aluminum creatures that labor in the air . For a moment I stand with them , hearing the shriek , the sawmill whine of the engines . A woman smiles at me and I am flattered by the healthy invitation in her glance to go with her to a bathroom stall and fuck . From the taxi I can see the wide streets , the glorious neon , the mutant beauty of the repetition of shoe stores , gas stations , restaurants . The air has a tropical odor , the stench of hydrocarbons , and I can feel the lush growth , the berserk vitality . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , creatures are touching one another and trembling . The city 's jungle texture makes me quiet , curious : I 've been away for years . It wo n't be long now , my mother 's letter says , It wo n't be long . They are trying new drugs on your father . They think he will be allergic to them so they put spots of the drugs on his forearms , you know , so they can see right away if it 's going to do anything to him . They put the drugs on his forearms . One spot on each . Only goats and baboons have taken these chemicals . Then they give your father the drug and they increase the dosage . More and more until he gets a little tremulous and then they try something new . He still likes the soup , but he does n't take as much as he used to . I 'm glad you are coming .  | The house is more dated than I remember , so much so that it looks like a movie set . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acacia , eucalyptus , and elm trees . There are banana plants , too , and beyond them , in the valley , there is the grid of streets . In the distance there are the foothills . My father opens the door . " So , " he says , " you have come to see me . " He 's shorter than he used to be . It 's as though he were in a fry-pan , cooking down . I can see the sharp bones in his face . " Come in , " he says . He has a blanket over his shoulders and he moves with a cautious gait . I put down my bag and reach out for him . Our awkwardness is something to behold , perfect . I take his forearms and squeeze them . He looks at me , trembles , flinches . " I love ... " " So what ? " he says . He waits for a moment ( trembling all the while ) , and I realize I 'm pushing my thumbs into his forearms , into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he says . The house has a sickroom quality : there 's a medicinal odor , a faint coolness , a smeared , greasy quality . The old man looks like an Indian under his blanket . His cheekbones are high and his nose is curved and pointed . " I got you some beer , " he says . " I ca n't drink it anymore . Come into the kitchen . " He has a bowed posture : the strings that are pulling him  | down seem to be strung from his head and shoulders to his feet and the strings are being twisted each day , tightened : I can see him strain against them , tremble with the effort . He puts a can and a glass on the table . " Thanks , " I say . It 's cold and good and it cuts the airplane 's unctuous atmosphere , the city 's hydrocarbon air . My father swallows and licks his lips . His blue eyes are drawn to the glass , and I can see that they are paler than before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his drugs . " Is that good ? " he says . " Yes , " I say . " It looks good , " says my father . " Drink another . " He pours out another can , watches as I drink . He purses his lips , has the savoring , remembering expression of one who has been dismissed . He closes his eyes . " Ah , " he says , smiling for a moment , thinking of an instant , the heat of a day , the drawn , puffy feeling of muscles , tight skin , the damp touch of a shirt , the taste of beer from a bottle . He reaches under the blanket , rubs his side , then looks at me . " Come outside , " he says . My father gathers his blanket together with one hand and we walk through the yard . Beyond him , over the valley , I can see the red-brown stratification of smoke . My father has grown things in the yard , and as he steps over each plant , he points @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tendril of a vine . He stops at his orchids , the delicate blooms , flowers he was never able to grow before : only recently has he discovered the gift , the patience to make them respond . He points at the delicate flesh , the petals that are pink and white , speckled with rust , others that are a reddish purple , labial and slick , and I can see the trembling in his 144  | arms : he lets me see the shaking , the tears in his eyes . " It 's hard to grow them , " he says . " There was nothing here at all . Nothing . " He points at the land that runs to the abrupt drop-off , the end of his small plateau . " Now there 's Chinese elm , hibiscus , bananas , eucalyptus . " " Yes , " I say . He touches my hand with the same gentleness he has reserved for the flowers , leads me through the garden . He stands for a moment , looking at me , then puts his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where he dozes in the pale sunlight on the sofa . In the evening my mother comes home . " Oh , oh , " she says , jumping up and down a little . " It 's been so long . So long since we 've seen you . " In ten minutes my mother and father are arguing . I listen to the harsh sounds , the vital , angry words . They 're still at it , Stargell , I think , still snapping like crocodiles . If the house were an instrument it would be a violin , strung with angry gut : the walls are vibrant . When my father sees me smile , he says , " Are you looking for trouble ? " " No , " I say . " That 's good , " he says . At night we watch the news , the daily death count . There is a piece of film which shows black cars in a cemetery , a tent , flowers , mourning clothes , a veil . " None of that shit for me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I 've taken care of it , " says my mother . " Is that clear ? " says my father , turning to me . " Yes , " I say . " Good , " says my father , staring again at the black cars . My mother goes to her job in the morning . My father and I walk in the yard , look at the plants . My father can see almost microscopic differences , a slight tro-  | pism of a leaf , the presence of one insect 's egg . There 's a light breeze and the smell of oil is in the air . " Look at the flowers I 've grown , " says my father . " Are n't they something ? " He pulls the blanket over his shoulder and goes into the house . In the afternoon we take a drive downtown , get on the freeway . The air is reddish , dusty : it looks like tons of rusted cars have been ground up and then sprayed over the city . I drive . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he slouches in the corner , his shoulder against the door , his feet on the transmission 's hump , but he keeps his eyes above the level of the windshield . I can see his pointed nose , the bones in his face against the passing gas stations , palm trees , houses , parked cars . There is a huge sign which shows a man dressed in spats and a cutaway ( with striped pants ) and a top hat . The man is bent at the waist , pointing a finger at and talking to a rat . The rat has a dark rubber-ball nose , whiskers , a nasty smile . The man in the cutaway has a large mallet behind his back and he 's getting ready to give it to the rat , although it seems to me he 's been taking a long time about it , since I remember him having the same conversation and pointing the same finger at the same whiskered rat twenty-five years ago . In the distance there is a cluster of buildings rising out of the flat land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hall stands like a monument to the movies . I expect at any minute the police cars to come dashing out like long black dogs , whining and howling , pursuing space monsters or bank robbers . My father 's silhouette is sharp against the landscape . He watches the oncoming concrete , the flashing white lines , and says , " Give it the gas . " He puts his hand under his coat and touches something there . I get off the freeway downtown and stop in front  | of the train station . It 's a Spanish building , covered with pink stucco , surrounded by palm trees , and it has , in the center of its Romanesque facade , a large clock . Our favorite restaurant ( which may as well be a shrine ) is across the street . The old man puts his nose into the air , sniffs , gently shakes his head . The restaurant has a high ceiling , green-and-white walls ( two tone , hospital style ) , sawdust on the floor , long tables at which customers sit on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost as wide as airplane propellers ) and they are turning in air that 's fragrant , filled with the odors of freshly baked bread , crisp celery , potato salad , onion soup , roasted meats . The counter is made of marble and people wait in line before it . I buy a sandwich on a small roll and a bottle of beer , and my father and I sit down . Each table has two or three pots of mustard , and each has a tongue depressor to spread it . The mustard is the hottest in the world . I spread some on my sandwich , have a bite , feel my eyes immediately begin to water , a wonderful stinging in my nose . There is a jukebox in the restaurant , although I 've never heard it played : the machine looks like the front end of a Southern Pacific train . My father does n't stare at the people who are around us , but he 's watching . There is a man in a long black coat . His gray hair , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it looks like a gray rope ( something from an abandoned sailing ship ) that 's slowly unraveling . His fingernails have never been cut either , and they coil at the end of each finger . He does n't want to break them so he eats carefully , with as much ceremony as a queen . There are women who have their entire history , household and all , in a Safeway shopping cart , and they stop for a sandwich , too . I see a woman spreading mustard with a tongue depressor.  | " I remember , " says my father . He nods , sniffs the air , the vegetables , the rolls , the sweet scent of butter , the odor of freshly chopped parsley . A blond woman , who is tall and who is dressed in clinging white silk , comes through the door and takes a place in the line before the marble counter . She fits perfectly , since the place is so crazy it did n't seem complete until she arrived . A breeze follows her through the door , pushes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : she does n't wear underclothes . The old man watches her . " I do n't get out that much , " he says . The woman moves away from the counter and sees the old man watching her . She stands with a sandwich on the heavy plate and holds a beer bottle with a glass upside down over its neck , and looks at the old bastard for a moment and smiles . It snaps his light . She is still standing there , looking at him . He puts his hand under his coat and strains , tries to pull his face into a smile , but all he can do is grimace . He sniffs the air and trembles . The woman in white silk , who 's cool and spirited , is still watching him , curious about what kind of crazy old man he is . She shakes her hair out a little , is still smiling . The old man has a guy wire trembling , but you can see he 's working on it . The smile rises , fills his face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walks away so that we can see her move . The old man sighs , relaxes , rubs his side . Stargell , I think , put some more mustard on the sandwich . It 's so hot it clears my head . The old man is taken with the woman in silk and I know he 's thinking , That 's it , boy , that 's enough ( just looking ) to keep me going for another week . He sees me watching him . " Finish your food , " he says . I finish the crust , a sharp-tasting bit of parsley , and then we go outside : the sunlight is as heavy as a glass door . The 148  | old man staggers a little , turns and glances once at the restaurant , savors the odors , the people , the slowly turning fans , the pots of mustard , the woman who smiled at him . I think of the way the silk clung to her , the sound her hare legs made when one brushed against another . You can feel the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old man when he gets into the car . He looks at the downtown buildings , the bullet-shaped arches , the Mediterranean train station , the Byzantine library , a natural-gas tank that looks like an accordion the size of a blimp , and as we drive on the freeway , he smells the ashy odor , feels the slight ( regularly spaced ) bumps in the road , the cold and vibrant tug , the cancer 's tendrils . We drive quietly for a while . " I ca n't , you know , " says the old man , " do anything with a woman anymore . It 's the disease . " He stares at the road ahead of us , touches his side , and I can see his face against the drive-ins , an artificial lake filled with ducks , lots filled with motorcycles , mobile homes , used cars . There are apartment houses that look like Christmas ornaments : they 've been sprayed with gold flecks . " She was beautiful , though , " says the old man about no one in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now he 's missing it . He smiles for a minute , remembers some heat , a lovely groan and jump , awe-filled eyes , the smell of cunt . He watches the houses , the gas stations and taco stands , the gritty glitter , billboards that are the size of drive-in movie screens . In the morning I go to the garage with him to look at a car he can no longer drive , a royal-blue 1956 Thunderbird . He used to put on his yachting cap , a blue shirt , and drive around town , ogling the women , racing young men . I 've seen him perched at the limit line of a signal trying  | to peek into the stovepipe light , the yellow one , to get a jump on the other cars . There 's a musty smell in the garage , dust on the car . My father puts his finger on a dent in the chrome Continental kit . " A two-by-four fell on it in the last earthquake , " he says . We stand before the car . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ style . I put my hand on the chrome Continental kit , and my father looks at the fingers and nails , the veins and knuckles , and realizes that our hands are identical . We have a mole in the same place . " I never noticed that , " he says . He puts his hand next to mine . " Look at that , " he says , shaking his head in wonder . The days come and go . I walk in the yard with him , look at the orchids , the trees . The smoky air changes color , from blue to brown , and back again . " The engineering of a tree is remarkable , " says my father . " It is thickest at the stump because that is the site of the most stress . From the wind . " My mother comes home and cooks , but the old man does n't eat . They stop arguing . The old man stops eating . " Why the hell should it be me ? " he says . " I never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother , at me , and then I see him screw down to watch a game show . Later , when I 'm sitting next to him , he pulls the blanket to his chest and says , " Do n't get me wrong , Stargell . I would n't have missed it for the world . " We look at one another . I can see the diaphragm in his eyes , the iris , open like blue peacock tails . He acts like one of those circus performers who put a couple of boards over their chest and then have a garbage truck run over them . I can see him grimace . He lifts against it , sets his shoulders , and strains . The television blats.  | " You 'll come to see me again ? " he says . " Yes , " I say . " You promise me ? " he says . I 've never heard him plead before . " Yes , " I say . " ' That 's good , " he says . " We 'll go downtown and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , still letting me see what 's in his eyes . Ile puts his hand next to mine . " The doctor says I should tell him when my ankles swell , " he says . I nod . " Well , " says my father , " fuck him . They are n't swelling . " He turns back to the television , the otherworldly colors , the beauty of high voltage , of x-rays : he seems already to be moving through the galaxies , the phosphorescent clouds . My father eats slowly now with his spoon . I see him flinch when he swallows . He continues . Before he goes to bed he shows me his ankles . " See ? " he says . They are the ankles of a long-distance runner , a little swollen , but not much . He pulls down his other sock , and then stands before me , his blanket over his shoulder , still looking like an Indian with his socks sagging beneath his ankles . He puts his hand against his side . " What are you doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks like some alkie Indian who just escaped from a booby hatch , a mad old man , touching his side and staring at me . " Trying to keep body and soul together , " I say . He sees me blush . " You can do that anywhere , " he says .  | He stands there for me to see , his socks still bunched at his heels . " You can do that right here , " he says . He shakes my hand , gives it a farewell squeeze , then goes to bed . He knows I 'll be gone in the morning , that I 'm catching an early plane . I pack my clothes . My mother comes into my room . I look at her face and think , Stargell , now you know what hard work dying is . " Thanks for coming , " she says . " You tell him I 'll be back , " I say . " Of course , " she says . I 've been away so long she does n't know how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I sit by the window of the airplane , feel myself being sucked into my seat , the now-we're-serious surge : the rumble and bounce are gone and we are airborne . My father was proud of me when I worked in the think tank . He got me started . On Saturday mornings he 'd say , If you were in the desert and had a piece of plastic and a cup , how would you get water ? Remember , no rain . Or , Why can you see your reflection in a window at night ? We ate toasty English muffins , lightly scrambled eggs , cherry tomatoes , cantaloupes , slices of ham , potatoes . The butter melted quickly on the muffins and I put strawberry preserves on them . I can still taste it , can feel the crunch . Well , said my father , well ? I 'll think about it , I said . Good , said the old man . And while you 're thinking you can buck and split those railroad ties I bought . It 'll make you strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is how you get water if you 're in the middle of a desert and you have a piece of plastic and a cup . You dig a hole and put the cup inside . Then you spread the plastic over the hole . You put stones around the edges of the plastic and one small stone in the middle : this makes an inverted cone , with its peak over the cup . During the day , t he air under the plastic gets very hot , so hot that it draws the little bit of moisture there is out of the ground . The plastic cools quickly at night . Water condenses on it and runs to the peak , the top of the cone , and from there it drops into the cup . A five-by-four piece of plastic will produce a pint of water every twenty-four hours . Windows become mirrors at night because they are opaque on one side , sealed by darkness . I get into a taxi , look at the hack license , recognize a man from Star : Shoeless Joe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little less when tips are low . He hits the meter and we pull into traffic , although the car is tipped to one side . It reminds me of a small sailboat in a wind . The hack is from the Star , all right : it sounds like a robot coughing up dry washers . " Hey , Joe , " I say . He looks around , lets me see a jowl the size of a bowling ball bag . " Stargell , " he says . " What the hell ! " His voice is muffled in himself : it comes out as a heavy slur . " Where you been ? " he says . " California , " I say . " Ai n't that something , " he says . 153  | He reaches onto the seat next to him , takes a doughnut from a box that looks like a small barn ( with a cow sticking its head out a window ) , and puts it into his mouth . " Is it warm there ? Is there lots of pussy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they say ? " " Yeah , " I say . " That 's good , " he says . " How are things ? " I say . Shoeless Joe 's face is so wide it is as if he had stepped out of a billboard poster . I can only see a patch of jowl in the rear-view mirror . " There was another grease job last week , " he says , reaching for a doughnut . " Who ? " I say . " I do n't know , " he says . " Some green hand , a new guy . " We drive for a while and I see the city rise , the latticelike arrangement of the lights , buildings that seem to be large crystals . " I ai n't making any money either , " says Shoeless Joe . " Look at me . I lost fifteen pounds . " He grabs a hunk of his stomach . " That 's too bad , " I say . Shoeless Joe is a monument , a rolling , miraculous creature . " When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " they 've had an experience . " " I 've never seen anyone like you , " I say . " You think so ? " he says . I nod . His eyes watch me in the rear-view . " What about the fifteen pounds ? " he says . " It does n't show , " I say . He continues eating the doughnuts , pulls up in front of my building . " Take it easy , " I say .  | " Sure , " he says . " Say hello to the Scum and Munson for me , " I say . " Sure , " says Shoeless Joe . " It 'll be a surprise . They ca n't remember if you quit or if you 're dead . " I watch the hack 's dome light disappear . No two televisions are tuned to the same program : climbing the stairs is like.walking through TV Guide . I knock on the green door , then use my key . Enid is sitting before the Genius , intent on a movie . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready to paint the floor . There is a large pile in one corner , and Enid sits before it , staring at the Genius 's snug perch . " Oh , " she says , " you 're back . " " What 's on the late show ? " I say . " A terrible film , " she says . " I 'm just watching it for the commercials . There 's a wonderful one with enzymes . They go chew , chew , chew . " She holds her hands up , makes them snap like small Doberman pinschers . " The enzymes are eating the stains out of clothes . " She smiles . " How is your father ? " she says . " Dying , " I say . But not dead , I think . Still ready to say , Fuck off , Jack . I know about my ankles . And do you see these onions , their skins breaking like old silk ? Can you see the ridges in the orchids ? " There it is , " she says . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take her shoulders in my hands , but she is staring at the television . There are small circles moving across the screen , and they are split down the middle so  | they look like they have mouths and they are chewing , snapping , eating some kind of stain . " I 'm sorry , Stargell , " says Enid . I sit down next to her after pulling a chair from the pile . " You can sleep on the couch for a few days , " she says . I want to touch her , just to sleep with her . " Do n't make it any worse , Stargell , " she says , when I sit down and gently put my leg against hers . In the old days she used to read ancient Greek aloud , explain the words , made me tremble with the grand old stories . We watch the movie together , and it 's not so bad , really . It 's about huge snails that eat people . Somebody kills one with a fire extinguisher , freezes it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyway ; it 's probably what a big snail deserves . But underneath it all I 'm thinking , What great snails , what great snails . Everyone hates them and wants to spray them with a fire extinguisher , but that does n't stop them . These snails just want a little peace and quiet and they would n't eat anybody if everyone would just mind his own fucking business . The vegetable choppers come on . " My father went home , " says Enid . We 're trapped in a TV tide , that quiet trough between the Sermonette and the Blue Birds ( who fly while The Star-Spangled Banner plays ) . There are four planes , and they rise in a diamond pattern , all streaming smoke , flying directly into the sky . When they reach a certain altitude the diamond breaks and the planes stream away from one another . The jets are flying close to or above the speed of sound . There is one shot from a wing camera and you can see that the wing is buffeting , pounding in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He went to the doctor , " says Enid . " is he all right ? " I say . 156  | " It was a new strain , " says Enid , gathering her bathrobe around her neck , as though the disease were a draft . The Blue Birds come on ! The Genius is bringing them in like memories of his youth . They rise , streaming smoke , dissolve into Old Glory . A test pattern hums at us . " I think my father was proud of it , " says Enid suspiciously . I shrug it off , since I 'm willing to give the old goat a break . " I boiled the sheets , " says Enid . " And the towels . I stirred them in a pot with a wooden spoon I bought . " I see the spoon ( the kind usually displayed on a wall with a fork of equal size ) leaning against the stove in the kitchen . " That should do it , " I say . " Do you think so ? " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the test pattern , the inane humming . " Yes , " I say . " Are you sure ? " she says . " Absolutely , " I say , making my voice sound as solid as a steel ingot . Enid gathers her bathrobe around her neck and I can see that she 'd wear a surgeon 's mask if she thought she could get away with it . She stands up and says , " Good night , Stargell . " She drifts into the bedroom , closes the door . There 's a little lock on the inside and I can hear her throw the small bolt . I carefully take the furniture off the sofa ( this is no time to aggravate Jack the Ripper ) and open the beartrap , stretch out on the clean sheets . They seem more cooked than boiled , old , as though a lifetime of nights spent on them , the squirming and restlessness , the silent rigidity , had been smoothed into comfort . 157  | " Stargell , " says my Parisian . " Stargell . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " says Jack the Ripper , " I know you 're in there . I heard you come in last night . " I wake , turn toward the door , see it tremble , the puffs of plaster falling from the frame . I pull on a pair of pants , look at the clock : it 's 7 A.M. Jack is standing in the hall . " Good morning , " says Jack the Ripper . One of his hands leans on the upper part of the doorframe . His fingers are as big as hot dogs . " I 've still got a week , " I say . " A little more , if you want the truth . " " I know you do , " says Jack . " But I do n't want to do anything . I just want to make sure you got the money . " " No problem there , " I say . Jack looks at me with a pained disbelief . " This comes by way of a friendly warning , " says Jack . " You just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Do n't worry , " I say . " Do n't worry ! " he says , slapping the doorframe and making a little more plaster fall . " You should worry ! And what did I tell you about the furniture ? What did I tell you about the relatives ? " I begin to close the door . " I 'll see you at Easter , " I say . " You just get the money , " says Jack . " Leave Easter out of it . " Jack looks a little sad , but he does n't say anything else . He turns and walks down the stairs . 158  | " Faster , " he says . I close my eyes , but the Parisian is gone , so I have a strong cup of coffee , then take a shower . I give the tin stall a couple of kicks : it 's like being in a thunderstorm , right in the clouds where the sound is so loud it makes you feel like you 're inside an aluminum garbage can that someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a paper , find myself walking with the employed , those people who have the luxury of being late . I snatch their strides , put my nose into the air , add mysterious figures in my head . I stop at the subway entrance , although I 'm tempted to hit Wall Street for a few hours : I could sit in the Exchange , watch the moving ticker , enjoy being in the center , the medulla oblongata of cash and power . I go into the newspaper store , a nice neighborhood place ( all the pornography is covered up so the kids ca n't see it ) . The woman who owns it lost the family nut at a Miami dog track : lousy face-lift , cheap permanent , a tan that came out of a bottle . She has a sullen , fast-food beauty . " Hey , " she says . " Stargell . Where you been ? " " The usual , " I say . I ca n't say Los Angeles . The words makes me feel the cold hum of cancer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I pick up a copy of the Times . " I hear you owe the Barber money , " she says . " It 's a crime , is n't it ? " I say . " Not yet , " she says . I walk on the avenue . The sun is out and there is a peaceful quality in the air . An old woman is being taken out to enjoy it . She is in a wheelchair and her head is on a pillow . A nurse is pushing the chair . When they pass I 159  | can see the old woman as she nuzzles the sunlight : she blinks her eyes , turns her head , sighs . She does n't smile , since she 's beyond that , but there is something in her pale skin , something in that wrinkled flinch , that acknowledges the season 's tick , the push in the earth . That 's the way I want to be when I 've turned into a big pink prune : wheel me around where I can feel the sun , hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What jobs there are in the newspaper : it seems that everyone has a long nose , no chin , and shits ice cream cones . Accountants , advertising executives , data processors , bankers . I 'd like to sit in a bank , you know , in a nice suit . I just sit there , peaceful as a jar of Vaseline , so the people could look at me and hear the Zen hum of the air conditioner . Field representatives , insurance , systems analysis . I put the paper down . When push comes to shove , the want ads make me feel as useless as one sock . I sit in the living room , drink coffee , wait . Enid rises , goes into the bathroom . When she comes out she stops before me . " Have you paid that dirty loan shark ? " she says . " Not yet , " I say . Sleep has mauled her : puffy face , swollen lips , welts . " You should pay him , " says Enid . " I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Who would want to hire you ? " she says . She 's got me there . Once she said , Stargell , you can do anything . Do you know that , my darling ? So this little pique , this ill humor , makes me think of other times . Enid sits opposite me , puts on her magistrate 's expression . " It makes me depressed , " says Enid , " to have you sleeping out here . " 160  | It 's like watching a train on flat land : you can see it coming for miles . " We ca n't have that , " I say . " That 's right , " says Enid . We sit for a moment . Enid holds my hand . " You 've got to find someplace to stay , " she says , " until I get better . " We spend the afternoon together . I watch a baseball game from spring training . One day your curve ball is breaking like a window in a riot , your fast ball is hopping , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to leave ? " says Enid . " Soon as I can , " I say . " When will that be ? " she says . As soon as I pay the loan shark , I think . " I love you , Stargell , " says Enid , gesturing with a quart of beer , " but I 'm intelligent . I 'm beautiful . Everyone says so . I should have married a rich man . " The building has its evening atmosphere . The Portuguese are yelling , cooking goat . It sounds like everyone is going to get a good spanking . Enid hums , sways back and forth , has her eyes set on some personal vision : Mr. Right , a tap-dancing stockbroker . I 'm pacing around a little , getting into a sorry mood , one that produces inventions and religious schemes . Ari left us a package that looks as though you should use it to blow up a bridge , but there 's just freeze-dried chocolate ice cream inside . Not half bad , really . " What 's wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting for the Times , " I say . 161  | Enid shrugs . " You would , " she says . That a girl , I think . Pretty soon you 'll be cleaning the oven with a Q-tip dipped in Windex . I walk up Sixth Avenue . The street is filled with people who are too medicated to talk so they wave at one another , look like big birds that are using the avenue as a runway . I wait in line at the newsstand , leaf through slick pornography , show no shame at all . The Times truck seems like an airplane that 's dropping supplies to the troops . I buy my paper and walk home , smelling a little bit of New Jersey in the air : the odor has a saw-blade edge . My favorite is the stench from the tranquilizer factory , just across the river . It smells like shit and rotting sharks , all the dreams that crazy people have : they 've been aired out to dry so everyone can be reasonable at the office . " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I say . I skim along , looking for something suitable . " Gorilla impersonator , " I say . " ' Wanted . Person to work in gorilla costume . ' " There 's a telephone number . The ad was n't in the paper yesterday . Enid flips on the late show , is oblivious , remembers the days when I was going to be somebody . The ad has appeared tonight for the first time . Stargell , I think , you 're saved . " I 'm going to bed , " I say . Enid grunts . I remember when we watched How Green Was My Valley and cried until we had the hiccups . I move Enid into the bedroom with the TV , climb into the beartrap . During a commercial break Enid comes through the door and kisses my cheek , just holds me for a moment and squeezes me and then closes the door . 162  | Gorilla , I think . Gorilla . The Portuguese quiet down . Hollywood has taken care of Enid . I sit under the covers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the orangutans hanging from the tires and hunks of drift they put in the cages , of the shaggy beasts swinging from branch to branch in the jungles , moving with fluid , pendulum-like alacrity , making the foliage quake . I can see the red eyes , the face that looks like a flat football , the dread-lock , zombie hair . At the think tank we did some gorilla work : some asshole wanted to know how the chimps got along , you know , which chimp was grabbing another 's wife , and I talked to a real gorilla man , a guy who had spent years in the jungles . One day he took off his clothes and walked into a band of monkeys and he lived with them for a year and a half . They accepted liim as a member of the band , as one of their own . I talked to him on the twenty-eighth floor . He was wearing a three-piece suit and you 'd never know he was as crazy as a whore with one leg . He knew plenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then he shook my hand and got into the elevator . Stargell , you 've got the jump on the other stiffs , since you already have the inside track on the chimp act . The whore with one leg was in Saigon and everyone thought it was good luck to fuck her : now she dances with a crutch in a bar on Fourteenth Street . She was from the superstition study . I still go up to Fourteenth Street , walk through the market , the open-air stalls where the wind-up toys and aluminum pots sit . The bar is near the meatpacking district and butchers stand in bloody aprons , eating a roast beef sandwich , drinking a shot and a beer , and watching the old girl shaking the stump , knocking the platform with her crutch , upstaging the jukebox music , 163  | the Supremes . She 's thinking , Do you like that ? Do you ? I applaud , stomp , whistle , but everyone in the bar is as lively as a potato , except for my darling , who gives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who lets me see the beauty of her eyes . I fall asleep thinking of the light moving in the leaves , of the lips and flat noses of gorillas , of the scent of their hide , the odor of bananas , of cool mornings when the band is sluggish and when the days are spent with one ape grooming another . I 'm clean , waiting , dressed in a gray suit , filled with coffee , expectations . The paper sits before me . I do n't want to appear overanxious , but then I do n't want to be late . " Hello , " says a woman , whose voice scares me . I had expected a carny screech , a barker or hustler , but this comes right out of the air conditioner , the electric typewriter , and chrome-and-leather furniture . " I think I have the wrong number , " I say . " I do n't think so , " she says . " Did you advertise for a gorilla ? " I say . " Yes , " she says . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Have you had amusement park experience ? " she says . " Yes , " I say . I think of the parks in California , of the sailors and their girlfriends ( chewing gum and drinking out of a pint ) , the cotton candy , the smell of popcorn , the reek of ozone from the rides , the buzz that made you think of the death house dim , the Rosenberg hum . 164  | " There 's a tryout , " says the woman , " in Queens this afternoon . At the park . " She tells me to go to the Trip to Mars ride , to meet the manager there . The Trip to Mars , I think , Stargell , just think what good times have been had there . " Four o'clock , " she says . " Four , " I say . " Have you got a car ? " she says . " No , " I say , a little sadly . But I 've been in the showrooms , have smelled the leather , touched the wheel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you had a car , " she says . She gives me directions : a little subway , a little bus , a little walk . It 's convoluted , but I get the most mileage this way . " No problem , " I say . " We 'll provide the suit , " says the woman . She hangs up , leaves me alone in the apartment again , but I 'm thinking , Stargell , old boy , you 've got an appointment . And that 's not all . I 've got to prepare , got to clean up my act . It 's ten o'clock , so I 've got a couple of hours . The table where I sit is next to the window . I have a view of the air shaft , the windows on the other side . There is an electric guitar repair shop downstairs , and the people who own the shop take the guitars into the bottom of the air shaft to test them . This makes Enid mad , but she 's learned to sleep through it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head between two pillows . Through a window on the other side of the air shaft I can see a woman , my favorite neighbor : this morning she is making herself a cup of tea . She has no clothes on , and I can see the movement of her breasts as she moves from the stove to the table . She puts the tea into the pot . I can see her 165
