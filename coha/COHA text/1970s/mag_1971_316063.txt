The millions of people who think that New York City is a nice place to visit-even if they would n't want to live there-normally keep the city 's hotels as busy as any in the world . But rising costs and the business recession have driven many New York hotels into the red . In the first three months of 1971 , their occupancy rate sank to 65% , the lowest in eight years . One of the few hoteliers who remains undaunted by that gloomy statistic is Real Estate Operator Harry Helmsley . This month he boldly opened Manhattan 's first new hotel since 1965 : the Park Lane , a $30 million tower overlooking Central Park . <P> Snob Appeal . Helmsley 's gamble on the Park Lane is all the more remarkable because it ignores the hotel industry 's growing reliance on conventions and banquets as a primary source of revenue . Like its older Manhattan neighbors , the Plaza , St. Regis-Sheraton and Pierre , the elegant Park Lane is designed mainly to lure well-heeled individual travelers , whether they are in New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each room , many of which are lavishly decorated with original paintings . Overnight rentals vary from $32 for a single to $140 for a two-bedroom suite . Says John Mados , director of Helmsley 's hotel operations : " You wo n't find any men with funny hats and name badges in my lobby . " The snob appeal may pay off : hotels charging $30-and-up per night have suffered less from the slowdown than those with more economical room rates . <P> <P> Helmsley , a tall , spare man of 62 , is used to taking risks in real estate , and has done well enough at it to become owner of the firm ( now called Helmsley Spear ) that hired him in 1926 after he left high school . He is one of the nation 's largest real estate operators . Helmsley either manages or has an interest in properties worth $2.5 billion , including Manhattan 's Empire State Building and Tudor City apartment complex , office buildings in Chicago and Detroit and apartment houses in Los Angeles , Houston and San Francisco . <P> Canyonized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of New York ( TIME , April 26 ) , Helmsley is convinced that his native city is still a good investment ; he currently has interests in newly rising buildings that will add 3,300,000 sq . ft. of office space to the canyonized city . " The companies that are moving out are being replaced by new companies and by expansion of old ones , " he says . Other builders agree : fully 25% of the office space currently under construction in the U.S. is located in Manhattan .
