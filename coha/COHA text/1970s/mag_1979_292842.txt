Not Isaac Asimov . Back in 1938 , the teenage author sold his first tale to Amazing Stories , a science-fiction magazine . Encouraged , he branched out from sci-fi to fields as varied as his interests : literary criticism , psychology , mathematics , mystery , poetry , humor , American history . Simenon may have written more thrillers , Chesterton more poetry and philosophy , Pulp Romance Writer Barbara Cartland more novels . But no single author has ever written more books about more subjects than Isaac Asimov . <P> This month he extends that record with the publication of his 200th book . Leave it to Asimov to complicate things by passing the milestone twice . With rival publishers equally eager to bring out the landmark work , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two offerings . <P> Both are remarkable works . Opus 200 is a cornucopia : for sci-fi buffs there are excerpts from the 1972 novel The Gods Themselves and the award-winning robot story The Bicentennial Man .

But he writes with total recall of his sister Marcia and brother Stanley ( now assistant publisher of the Garden City , N.Y. , daily Newsday ) and of their early days in Brooklyn , where Papa Asimov serially owned five candy stores . <P> " A candy store is open every day of the week , " writes Asimov of those early days . " In some respects , it made me an orphan . " The demands of the store cut him off from his parents ; Isaac 's behavior severed him from his contemporaries . For he was not only brighter than his older classmates , he was eager to make them aware of his stratospheric IQ.              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
