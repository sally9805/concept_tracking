txt WILLIAM S. MILLER , former state racing board chairman , called Mrs. Marje Everett , former head of the Arlington Park and Washington Park racetracks , a liar yesterday . Miller , testifying in the trial of ex-Gov . Otto Kerner and Theodore J. Isaacs , former state revenue director , said he prayed and sometimes cursed when he read the testimony last week of Mrs. Everett , another government witness . She had testified that Miller had life and death power over her enterprises and accused Miller of extortion in pressuring her to make 50 shares of racetrack stock available in 1966 at 1962 prices to Kerner and Isaacs . MILLER MADE the blunt accusation about the former queen of Illinois racing . once his closest friend , before Federal Judge Robert L. Taylor and a jury in Federal District Court which is hearing charges of conspiracy , bribery , and income tax evasion . Under indictment for the charges , but ? who may be granted immunity for his testimony , Miller was under crossexamination by Kerner 's chief counsel , Paul R. Connolly .. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which Mrs. Everett testified . It involved a charge that Miller had a conversation with her between Jan. 9 and April 18 , 1967 , in which she said he asked her to help him get control of the Balmoral Jockey Club and the Chicago . Harness Racing Association . " DID YOU TELL Mrs. Everett you wanted her to help you get control of B. J. C. and C. H. R. in that period of time ? " Connolly asked , " Answer yes or no , " he instructed Miller . After a long pause , the 72-year-old millionaire Miller began his reply : " I think it would be better for me to say no because I want to offer a qualification because the court is eager to hear the full story . There were plans ? the files are full of them  --  relating to B. J. C. and C. H. R. " SO IF Mrs. Everett meant that I as racing board chairman possessed this great power of which I am informed in the newspapers , life or death , that I demanded of Mrs. Everett @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ J. C. and C. H. R. , then Mrs. Everett is a liar . " Connolly followed up the defense strategy of pitting key government witnesses against each other by pressing for more reaction from Miller . " You got steamed up , did n't you , when you read the newspaper reports of this trial ? " Connolly asked . " I READ IT with an unmeasurable amount of unpleasantness , " Miller said . " I read it with a certain amount of equanimity . I read it in prayerful solitude . " Connolly asked , " You cursed a little bit , too , did n't you ? " When Miller nodded his head in affirmation , Connolly said , " But you prayed more than you cursed ? " Miller nodded his head again . " I read it with contempt bUt with a certain amount of compassion , " Miller said . CONTRADICTING Mrs. Everett 's testimony about . Miller 's power plays , and . his negotiations between her and Isaacs for the delivery of . the ' stock , Miller said Mrs. Everett acted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ required no nourishment from Miller , " he said . " I a c ted like a mild-mannered scold , admonishindher to . consuit her a t t or ne But she wanted to keep Isaacs on her string as long as he lad . an ' in ' with Kerner . " , Referring to an arrangement by which she made stock available to Joseph E. Knight , former state director of financial institutions , Miller said : " MARJE WAS ecstatic to have Joe Knight in her corner . She knew he wanted stock in CHR and knew his name had to ? be hidden under the name of a nominee as the others other state officials were . " The defense used Miller 's testimony about his years as racing board chairman and of the thriving Illinois racing industry to reflect fpvorably upon Kerner 's administration . Connolly , in bringing out Millees national ' reputation for racing excellence , said , " We could call ' these the Miller years , but since you are not a defendant we will call them the Kerner years . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the the horsemen , the horses , and the state all ought to be considered and made ' as comfortable as possible at racetracks . When asked about a 1965 raid by . Internal Revenue Serviee ' agents on illegal bookmakers at Sportsman 's Park racetrack , Miller said , " I do n't want to evade the question , and I do n't want to be unfair , but I saw no evidence there of culpable collaboration with bookmakers . I 'm not trying to be irreverent to the IRS . I venture to say that If they had raided any racetrack in the United States at that time they would have found the same thing . " I HAD MY POCKET picked while I was at the Vatican but I do n't believe His Holiness had anything to do with It . A racetrack is an attractive nuisance , " he said . Miller , somewhat listless and tired at the end of Thursday 's testimony , became more aggressive during the Friday afternoon session . When Connolly , a tall , ruddy faced man with white hair , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a conference he had with officials from the First National Bank , Miller said , " I defy you to bring them in and put them under oath . " WHEN CONNOLLY said they were scheduled to appear as witnesses , Miller said , " I 'll be delighted to sit here and listen to them . " A 5-foot-high filing cabinet containing Miller 's personal papers seized by the government was in the courtroom . At one point , Connolly asked for a document and Miller said he did n't know the combination of the lock . Oliver P : Stufflebeam , the chief IRS agent In the case , took only 91 seconds to open the cabinet . WHEN CONNOLLY noted that Miller failed to destroy a racing deal memo as requested by one of his associates , Connolly remarked , " You squirrelled it , did n't you . You put it in your files as a nugget . " " I squirrel all my nuggets , " Miller said . LATER , WHEN Connolly got Miller to admit that one of his associates made a $100,000 error @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a big one is n't it , $100,000 ? " Miller replied , " Lawyers are always careless with other people 's money . " " You should know , you 're a . retired lawyer , " Connolly said .
