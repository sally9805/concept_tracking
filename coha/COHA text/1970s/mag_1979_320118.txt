A hot sport combines the best of sailing and surfing <P> Britain 's Prince Charles practiced it in the chilly waters off the Isle of Wight . Marlon Brando mastered it between takes of a film . A few plucky vacationers have even used it to island-hop among the Bahamas . From St. Louis to Saint-Tropez , people who used to ride sailboats or surfboards-or would not be caught on either - are trying something that combines the best of both : windsurfing , a fast-growing sport that makes the practitioner a part of his boat as he holds the sail , and the wind , in his hands . <P> On Long Island Sound , on San Francisco Bay , on rivers and lakes across the country , wind-surfers are multiplying like lily pads . Industry officials figure there are some 25,000 of them out there , or twice as many as last year . Hardy souls in Boston don wet suits and climb aboard their boards as soon as the ice breaks on the Charles River , and during the Fourth of July festivities , half a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Wind-surfing championships will be held this fall in Clearwater , Fla. , with competition in such categories as slalom-type racing , freestyle , long-distance ( up to 15 miles ) and buoy ball ( a kind of water rugby ) . For those more inclined toward the social aspects of the sport , there are more than 100 " fleets " or clubs in the U.S. and Canada that hold informal regattas . " The sport is developing very much like skiing , " says Dick Lamb , president of the International Windsurfer Class Association . " You have a highly competitive elite at the top , yet it 's a sport simple enough to be done by anyone wherever there 's a body of water . " <P> The object of all this enthusiasm is a 40-lb. slab of foam-filled polyethylene , 12 ft. long and shaped like a surfboard , but with a sail attached . Such a wind-surfing board will support up to 400 Ibs . The craft was invented twelve years ago when two young Californians , Hoyle Schweitzer , a surfer , and Jim Drake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and problems of their respective passions . Surfing , Schweitzer complained , was too dependent on wave conditions ; sailing , Drake sighed , was tied to wind conditions and required a time-consuming ritual of rigging the boat . So they retired to Schweitzer 's Pacific Palisades garage and built a craft that combined the best and avoided the worst of both . After selling a few models to friends , Schweitzer left his job as vice president of a computer service firm , bought out Drake 's interest and founded Windsurfing International Inc . Today the firm employs 80 at its Marina Del Rey factory and will turn out 12,000 boards this year . There are a wider , more stable version for kids and beginners ( $595 ) , the standard model ( $745 ) and the " Rocket , " with foot straps for better control at high speeds ( $795 ) . Sailrider Inc. of South Salem , N.Y. , this year will produce 3,000 units of a similar craft ( $679 ) made of cy-clolac , a high-impact plastic , which along with its rig weighs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firm to make and market the board in Europe , and at least 60 European companies are producing imitations . In fact , Europe has become the center of windsurfing activity : more than 130,000 boards will be sold there this year .
