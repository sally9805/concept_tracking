The U.S. Roman Catholic Church faces a shortage of new priests , and Jewish seminaries are just managing to catch up with the demand for rabbis . Yet at many Protestant seminaries across the nation , this year 's graduating seniors are finding that even though jobs are available , the clerical market is showing signs of softening . Not too long ago , many newly minted ministers could expect to pick and choose among " calls " from four or five churches . Now they are receiving fewer offers and having to campaign more aggressively even for what were once considered less desirable positions : assistantships or pastorates at small rural congregations , with salaries of , say , $7,000 a year . <P> At Manhattan 's Union Theological Seminary , at least nine of the 63 graduates receiving the basic ministry degree are still looking for jobs , and those who have them , notes a placement worker , had to do " a great deal more footwork " than their predecessors . Adds the Rev. Harry Adams , associate dean at the Yale Divinity School @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back , " dream up their own things , and find someone to fund them . " <P> First Decline . The supply of pulpits is becoming tight because , while seminary enrollments are holding steady , Protestant church membership is shrinking . The latest edition of the authoritative Yearbook of American and Canadian Churches reports that U.S. membership in religious bodies slipped last year to 131,245,139 . Though the decline was slight ( about 180,000 ) , it was the first that the Yearbook has recorded in nearly three decades , and reflected eroding membership in the mainstream liberal Protestant denominations : the United Methodists , Episcopalians , United Presbyterians , the United Church of Christ and the Christian Church ( Disciples of Christ ) . In such groups , jobs are lacking not so much for new graduates as for mid-career preachers seeking better churches . <P> Not all aspiring Protestant ministers are hurting for jobs . Evangelistic , Bible-oriented denominations like the Southern Baptists are still growing steadily . In more liberal denominations , with their tighter job market , congregations are hiring a different sort of pastor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Episcopal Divinity School in Cambridge , Mass. , " got burned during the ' 60s by angry young men , " and hire graduates who want to perform in the pulpit rather than in the streets . When a congregation offers a " call " nowadays , notes the Rev. Vinton Bradshaw of the Christian Theological Seminary in Indianapolis , the message is that " they do not want a social activist .
