the Republic comes to be written ( by liberals , presumably , as it usually is I , the fortnight beginning October 6 , 1975 , will probably not be listed as one of the decisive periods in which great events were decided or even adumbrated . One can search the public record of those two weeks in vain to find a Saturday-night massacre , a great Constitutional confrontation , a missile crisis . But a lot did happen . The politics of the Bicentennial year were certainly foreshadowed , widespread impressions that Gerald Ford and his advisers lacked even elementary political intelligence were dispelled at least temporarily ? and Congressional Democrats took the first tentative steps toward their quadrennial goal of finding the precise stance which could cost them the Presidential election . Things began quietly enough . On Monday , October 6 , public debate , such as it was , had centered on just how long a suspended sentence Patty Hearst would receive when she was restored to her previous life , and whether or not the two assassination attempts against President Ford had made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Neither issue had much steam . Then , that afternoon , the White House press office asked the three networks for one-half hour of prime time for a Presidential statement about taxes . For some time , Mr. Ford 's advisers had been considering whether he should move to make permanent the $12 billion temporary tax cut the Democratic Congress had voted earlier in the year . That tax measure , enacted over Ford 's strong opposition and signed by him with great and public reluctance , cut personal and corporate taxes as an anti-recession measure . Most economists outside the Administration agree that , to the extent there has been recovery from the 1974-75 recession , the tax cut has been chiefly responsible . If continued in 1976 , it would reduce taxes by $17 billion . By October 6 it seemed clear in Washington that Ford would propose that the cut be made permanent , or at least as permanent as these things ever are in Washington . ( In the case of tax legislation , " permanent " means " until the membership of the Ways and Means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thought that something was afoot be yond a mere extension . The White House spokesmen were talking of a " major address " on taxes , and there was something about the story that did n't quite ring true ? nobody had been told that Ford would propose an extension , and , in the candid and open White House operation we have had since August 1974 , everything is known in advance , usually hi two or three versions . T HE NETWORKS responded curiously to the Ford request . In the past , a President any President ? had only to suggest that he would like time , for any purpose , and CBS , NBC , and ABC would roll over like well-trained spaniels . ( Once , they even gave time to a President 's attorney , James St. Clair . for a press conference at San Clemente , but that was long ago . ) But on October 6 the networks acted like anything but their usual roundheeled selves . ABC , after thinking the matter over , decided to carry the Ford speech , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It was not a hard decision for ABC to reach . The network 's offering at 8:00 P.M. Monday was Barbary Coast , a show whose ratings were so low as to guarantee its disappearance before the end of the season . In addition , ABC had a strong entry at nine o'clock , NFL football , and the judgment that the Ford speech was newsworthy undoubtedly contained another judgment ? that the President , whatever he said about taxes , would deliver a larger audience to the football game than would Barbary Coast . So ABC was on board . At CBS , however , there was a different story . On Monday night , without any help from the White House , CBS is supreme , with three shows ( Rhoda , Phyllis , and All in the Family ) regularly in the Nielsen top ten . The ratings alone almost guaranteed that CBS would fail to find the Ford address newsworthy , but there was another , better reason to keep the President off the air . This year CBS is campaigning hard to repeal the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law now requires that when a candidate for public office receives free time on a station or network ? for a speech or a news conWHAT 'S WRONG WITH THE DEMOCRATS ? ference ? his opponents must be offered the same amount of free time ? at a comparable hour . The networks , led by CBS , have always been for repeal of this requirement , using the curious argument that it limits free speech . In fact , of course , it expands free speech , by guaranteeing either that opposing candidates will have as much access to television as their more powerful or wealthy rivals , or that no candidate shall be shown . The act , of course , limits not free speech but network revenue , since it requires the donation of time which could otherwise be sold , either to another candidate or to a purveyor of bathroom tissue . CBS seized on the equal-time provision to turn down the White House request , although in this case it was a very thin excuse . The reason it was thin ? and the reason ABC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this writing , has no opponents . He is running , not for the Presidency , but for the Republican nomination , and he is virtually unopposed . ( There is an obscure felow in Massachusetts who has said he will run against Ford in that state 's primary , but he has not filed for that purpose , and ABC 's attorneys felt safe in ignoring him . ) NBC followed the CBS lead and stayed with its regular programming . So when Ford spoke on Monday night , appearing only on ABC , he drew barely a 20 percent share of the TV audience . What he said , however , was worth a great deal more attention . He proposed not only to continue the $17 billion tax cut , but to add $11 billion to it , making an offer to the people of what seemed to be a giant $28 billion tax reduction . There was , said the President , only one catch , and that catch ( Catch 28 ? ) set in motion the 1976 campaign . The $28 billion tax reduction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if Congress agreed to cut federal spending by the same amount . That was a little tricky , too , since he was n't really asking for a $28 billion cut in spending any more than he had been offering a $28 billion tax cut . ' Under present budget planning , Ford claimed , the budget for fiscal year 1977 , which begins on October 1 , 1976 , will call for $423 billion of spending . Ford , then , wanted Congress to set a ceiling for that budget at $395 billion . Nevertheless , it was easier to call the thing an offer for $28 billion in tax reductions if Congress would cut spending by the same amount , and that is the way it was reported the next day . Ford had got in the first shot and , except for the limited TV audience , it proved an effective one . White House mail began running heavily in favor of the proposal ( you can trust those counts now ) , and so did the early editorial comment . T HE DEMOCRATS ' response was predictable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ response to any Presidential idea will be a Congressional response . The reply was negative , and on grounds totally unrelated to the issues Ford had raised . Ford had talked of the crushing burden of taxation , on the one hand , and of uncontrolled " big spending " on the other . Both are highly popular issues . The Democrats pointed out , first , that the Ford plan was " political " ? which it clearly was , but so is almost everything a President says or does . To buttress their argument , they pointed out that the tax cuts would take effect immediately , in time for 1976 payment , but the budget cuts would not begin to be felt until several months later , after the fiscal year began , and after the Presidential election . Second , the Democrats ? led by Chairman Edmund Muskie of the new Senate Budget Committee ? said the Ford proposal would undermine Congressional budget procedures . Since the President has not yet presented his 1977 budget , they said , how could the Congress proceed to Cut it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked Treasury Secretary William Simon the next day , " that you want us to establish a general spending ceiling before we know the specific amount the President is requesting ? In other words , are you asking us to cut something called ' federal spending ' without knowing which of our favorite programs may have to suffer ? " Simon , who knows more about politics and less about economics than he is given credit for , had a straight answer : yes . Simon then took something off his fast ball , however , by adding that the whole matter came clown to a question of whether or not we were going to become " socialistic . " That changed the argument somewhat , because if there is anything Americans have learned , it is that when a Republican brings up socialism , he is proposing a cut in unemployment insurance . There the matter rested until Thursday , October 9 . Ford and his people continued to hit the main theme ? you can have a big tax cut if only the Congress will cut govern . ment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Democrats were talking about political machinations and Congressional budget procedures , subjects dear to no one 's heart once you leave Capitol Hill . On Thursday the White House announced a press conference on the tax issue for prime time , and once again asked for network cooperation . This time the network response was reversed , and for the same reasons which had animated the Monday decisions . Thursday night , as the White House must have known , is ABC night in the ratings . ABC therefore concluded that the press conference was not newsworthy , although it would involve the same subject which had been so highly newsworthy Monday night . But CBS was now hoist by its own equal-time petard . The FCC , largely at CBS 's urging , had , a few weeks before , specifically exempted Presidential press conferences from the equal-time rule . Consequently , since CBS had publicly put its refusal to run the speech on Monday on the high Constitutional ground of free speech rather than the low commercial ground of ratings , it had to give the time to Ford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beaten every Thursday by ABC anyway , again went along with CBS . Thus , as a result of this change of heart on the news value of tax cuts , the issue became widely known and discussed . In response to a question expressing the Democratic objection to the timing of the two proposals ? cut taxes now , expenses later ? Ford was the soul of graciousness . If that was what was bothering Congress , he said , lie would be happy to accept the spending cuts now , out of this year 's budget . So much for Con18 gressional procedures . Two weeks later , the Democrats in Congress gave their final answer . The Ways and Means Committee ignored the extra tax-cut sweetener , voted down the budget cuts on a straight party-line vote , and returned to the House a straight extension of the income-tax cut of 1975 for one more year . There were rumblings from the White House that , without the spending cuts , there might be a veto . We shall sec . But what emerged from all this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , almost all of the Democratic Presidential aspirants ) missed the point . The spending issue could easily have been theirs for the rest of the campaign . All they had to do ? and if they had tested the sentiment in the country , what they might very well have done ? was to accept the Ford proposal . " Very well , Mr. President , " the answer might have gone , " we like the idea of a $28 billion tax cut and a $28 billion spending reduction . We will vote the tax cut now . As for the spending cuts , we will immediately reduce the Pentagon budget by $14 billion , since spending there is almost exactly half of all controlled spending . As to the remaining $14 billion , we await your pleasure as to which other federal programs you wish us to cut . We will guarantee you $14 billion , but we may differ as to where those additional cuts will come . " Now that would have been an answer , but such an answer would bespeak a two-party system , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far , and The Final Crisis of Richard Nixon ( both Quadrangle ) .
