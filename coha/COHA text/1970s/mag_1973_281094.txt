THE GOOD DOCTOR by NEIL SIMON <P> Except for the rare and freakish abnormality , nature never violates the integrity of its forms . One can not imagine , for example , nature grafting a giraffe 's neck onto the body of a hippopotamus and topping it off with a chipmunk 's head . Yet man , the born tinkerer , is forever fashioning hybrids out of his art forms . With reckless profusion , novels are turned into plays , plays into musicals , musicals into movies and vice versa . This is partly a matter of crass commerce , partly of dried-up imagination , and partly of pure madness . <P> In the case of Neil Simon , such tinkering may more accurately be described as an affectionate whim , an experimental doodle by a humorist who has chosen to go temporarily AWOL . He has taken some Chekhov short stories , and with a fond , undeviating respect , adapted them into a kind of narrative revue . The show is knit together by a commentator , " The Writer " ( Christopher Plummer ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great and good dramatist and doctor . <P> The first thing that comes to mind is that if Chekhov had thought that any of these stories had the makings of plays , even one-acters , he would have written them that way . In second-guessing Chekhov , Simon merely confirms that Chekhov made the right decision in the first place . A further drawback is that Simon and Chekhov are not on the same wave length of humor . Simon 's forte is the self-deprecatory one-liner with a New York Jewish accent . Chekhov 's humor contains a deep-flowing Slavic melancholy together with a riotous farcicality . Compassionately , his work embraces the innate foolishness in all of humanity . Atmosphere and nuance , all-important in Chekhov , are not Simon 's strength , and having a sort of Fiddler on the Roof band concertizing on stage for 20 minutes before curtain time does not a Russia make . <P> The sketches are pretty wispy stuff , ranging from a government clerk sneezing on a general at a most inopportune moment to a dental student ecstatically extracting a tooth to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manager . The second half of the show is distinctly brighter and breezier than the first . The entire cast is not only exemplary , but extraordinarily versatile , and Christopher Plummer , as usual , provides superior acting with facile , enviable ease . <P> " Doc " Simon , as he is known , has provided so much pleasure to so many playgoers over the years that he is certainly entitled to prescribe a brand of entertainment that exerts a tonic effect on him . If the comic medicine seems a trifle watery on this occasion , it still possesses more potency than the dramatic quack remedies so often fobbed off on Broadway .
