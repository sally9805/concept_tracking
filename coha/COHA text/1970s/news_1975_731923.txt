txt With U.S. Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger 's step-by-step efforts for a Middle East settlement stalled , Moscow has made a dramatic initiative to get back into the act to settle the Arab-Israeli conflict . Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei A. Gromyko 's offer ? in return for Israeli concessions to join in guaranteeing Israel 's frontiers is the first time that either of the superpowers has so firmly given such an undertaking . The concessions asked of the Israelis in return are : ( 1 ) withdrawal from occupied Arab territories ; and ( 2 ) acquiescence in the establishment of a Palestinian state . There is speculation here that the Soviet Union may have taken soundings in advance on what it was proposing to announce not only with the United States but also with Israel . Soviet experts are strongly hinting that the main objective of two Soviet emissaries who quietly visited Israel early this month was to get agreement from Prime Minister Yitzhak ' Rabin 's government that it would give the Soviet proposal careful and positive consid eration . It is assumed here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's public posture of belittling their visit . Francis Ofner cables from Tel Aviv : Israelis are uncomfortable about the upsurge of Soviet diplomatic activity in the Middle East . Official spokesmen in Jerusalem are not particularly impressed by Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko 's offer of a guarantee . As these officials see it , the Soviet Union is seeking to reassure the U.S. and the West while quietly at the same time trying to set up a Soviet-controlled or Soviet-guided bloc of Arab states on Israel 's eastern border . // *Soviet bid to Israel // I It is in this latter context that Israelis see the recent visit to Jordan of top Soviet Mideast diplomat Vladimir Vinogradov and their week 's visit to Syria of Soviet chief of staff and missile expert Gen. Viktor Kuliakov . Soviet experts explain that a key factor in the development of the plan outlined by Mr. Gromyko would be the response of Saudi Arabia . This in turn will determine the reaction of the Palestinian leader Yassen Arafat , who is scheduled to visit Moscow next week . Moscow is very optimistic that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan unfavorably and will lend his authoritative support to Mr. Arafat if the latter accepts the basic idea of the deal . There is a tendency here to see the Soviet proposal as a snub to President Sadat of Egypt , who has hitherto kept the Soviet Union out of Middle East peacemaking by insisting so long on keeping U.S. Secretary of State Kissinger as the middleman . Egyptian Foreign Minister Ismail Fahmy was in Moscow for talks earlier this week . It is not known whether the Soviet proposal was discussed with him . But in any case , its public disclosure came from the lips of Mr. Gromyko at a banquet in honor of Syrian Foreign Minister Abdel Khalim Khaddam who came into Moscow hot on Mr. Fahmy 's heels . John Cooley cables from Beirut : The Gromyko offer is seen here as part of a pattern of discreet Soviet efforts to renew a political dialogue , if not diplomatic relations , with Israel . Its impact is considerable , because it was made in a speech welcoming the Syrian foreign minister in Moscow . Of the Arab @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Syria might be the hardest to convince of the need for future security guarantees to Israel . Syria also enjoys the best relations of the Arab " front line " states with Moscow . It is thus thought Moscow may be trying to make it easier to reopen the Geneva conference .
