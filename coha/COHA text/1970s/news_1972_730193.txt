txt It 's a dreamworld we resident foreign newsmen live in these days . A high Soviet official is giving bona fide press briefings . American television crews are running around the city shooting and processing their own film . Soviet journalists have suddenly appeared to hobnob openly and affably with their overseas counterparts at a full-blown press center . And , if this were n't enough , Soviet newspapers are splashing photographs of President Nixon on Page 1 . All this Communist amiability is mind-boggling . Americans at home may not realize it , but they are getting rare , uncensored television glimpses of Moscow this week because U.S. crews are filming what they want and not what Soviet editors permit . Ordinarily , TV correspond  --  nts here must use Soviet crews and are always accompanied by an official " interpreter " who virtually dictates what may and may not be filmed . And the taboos can and do extend to scenes as innocuous as a group of old men playing chess . Plainly , the Russians now are doing their best to accommodate the American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local correspondents and some free-floaters who came on their own ) . Before the summit got off the ground there were accreditation problems and American-side requests met the customary bureaucratic response , " Impossible , " or , " It ca n't be done . " But once Mr. Nixon arrived and was closeted with Soviet leaders , the atmosphere began to warm up . // *Moscow turns on the charm for newsmen // In press facilities , however , the Russians take a back seat to the Chinese . Correspondents who were also in Peking with the President say they had far more spacious and efficient working conditions there " Our facilities here are abysmal , " said writer James Michener at the third floor press center in the Intourist hotel " The Chinese gave everyone plenty of typewriter space . Of course , that occasion was an opening up , and the Chinese were doing things with a flair Morebver , ? they had fewer journalists to cope with " " The Chinese were meticulous , " commented another Peking veteran " Nothing slipped up in the communications ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closed in China , " commented Hugh Sidey of Life magazine " We could n't learn from the Chinese what was going on . The Russians at least told us immediately when Nixon first - met with Brezhnev . " But usually little more than such bare facts emerge from the joint press con-ferences ? which the Russians insisted onin preference to separate briefings by each side , perhaps because they feared the White House press establishment might run away with the whole show . Presidential Press Secretary Ron Ziegler is to the point in his answers and , of course , says only what Mr. Nixon allows him to say Leonid M. Zamyatin , the silver-haired , urbane director-general of Tass , who is briefing for the Soviet side , tends toward wordier replies that need to be sifted for meaning and that , after translation , come out homogenized But he has an alleviating sense of humor . ? " How was Mr. Brezhnev 's invitation conveyed to the President ? " he was asked the first day . " I think there are ample ways of getting in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Zamyatin with an air of genial amusement . Everyone laughed American TV networks , for their part . are complimentary about how the Russians are handling live transmissions , for which Soviet equipment and crews are used " Their facilities are superb , and they are doing it all beautifully , " said an NBC man Although there is general satisfactionwith the flow ( if not amount ) of information . foreign journalists recount tales of minor frustrations and bureaucratic snafus And some unpleasant incidents At the airport on May 22 a rhubarb developed when the press pool by some ei roi was not allowed to join the motorcade into the Kremlin end was driven directly to the Rossiya Hotel And when a CBS camernian started taking pictures near the Kremlin wall as the President 's car came in . sight , an overzealous Soviet militiman wrapped the American 's tie around his neck and punched him in the stomach But as the presidential visit progresses , things are sorting themselves out , and each day sees some improvement One hal assed correspondent commented brightly , " Maybe I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evening as it was this morning " As for those American correspondents who live in Moscow and can appreciate the momentary " thaw , " they would share the sentiment of a Soviet colleague who commented wistfully " The only trouble is that Nixon does not come often "
