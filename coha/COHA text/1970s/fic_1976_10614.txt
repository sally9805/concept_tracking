. He was blond like his half-brother , but his tilted brown eyes must have snuck in from the Baum side of the family , and he had his Grandpa Baum 's delight in noise and crowds . Even as a baby , being wheeled along in his caramel-colored wicker carriage , he would go into fits of glee at the sight of passing strangers . He liked anything musical  --  church bells , hurdy-gurdies , the chants of the street vendors selling hot crabcakes . When he was a little older he took to the streets himself , riding an iron velocipede with a carpeted seat . He and Daniel were confined to the sidewalk in front of their house , but while Daniel obeyed instructions , leafing through The Youth 's Companion on the front steps with his chick-yellow head bent low , Caleb would sooner or later be tugged southward by the fire bell or the gathering of a crowd or , of course , the sound of a street musician . He followed the blind harpist and the banjoist , the walking piano that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Pardon Came Too Late . " Then someone would think to ask , " Where 's Caleb ? " His mother came out on the front steps , a fan of creases rising up between her eyebrows . " Daniel , have you seen Caleb ? " And search parties would have to be sent down all the streets running toward the harbor . Only everybody soon learned : if you wanted to find Caleb , hold still a minute and listen . Whenever you heard distant music somewhere in the town , maybe so faint you thought you imagined it , so thin you blamed the whistling of the streetcar wires , then you could track the sound down and find Caleb straddling his little velocipede , speechless with joy , his appleseed eyes dancing . The maid would touch his sleeve , or Daniel would take his hand , or Laura would grab him by the earlobe , muttering , " This is where I find you ! Out with a bunch of . . . well , I do n't know what your father is going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to think of you for this . " Only she never told his father . Perhaps she thought that she would be held to blame . Sometimes , from the way she acted , you would think she was afraid of Justin . On Sundays the Pecks went to church , of course , and on Wednesday evenings Laura had her Ladies ' Circle . On holidaysp53there were the formal visitors : Justin 's business associates and their wives , along with their starched , ruffled children . But you could n't say that the Pecks had friends , exactly . They kept to themselves . They were suspicious of outsiders . After guests left , the family often remarked on the gentlemen 's inferior brand of cigars , the children 's poor manners , the wives ' regrettable overuseof Pompeiian Bloom rouge . Daniel listened , memorizing their words . Caleb hung out the window to hear an Irish tenor sing " Just a Lock of Hair for Mother . " Daniel was a tall , cool , reflective boy , and from the beginninghe planned to study law . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preparation for this Caleb attendedthe Salter Academy , walking there daily with his friend Paul and a few of the neighborhood boys . He worked very conscientiously , although sometimes his mother suspected that his heart was n't in it . Corning home from school he could be waylaid by any passing stranger , he fell willingly into conversation with all sorts of riffraff . He had no discrimination . And he still followed organ grinders . With his pocket money he bought tawdry musical instruments , everything from pennywhistles to a cheap violin sold him by a sailor ; he could make music out of anything . He played these instruments not only in his room but outdoors as well , if he was n't caught and stopped . More than once he was mistakenly showered with coins from someone 's window . When Laura heard about it she would grow dark in the face and order him to remember his name . She shut him in the parlor , where he continued to spill out his reckless , made-up tunes on the massive piano draped in fringed silk . Unfortunately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ragtime . A disreputable , colored kind of music . Justin , home in his study doing the accounts , would raise his head to listen for a minute and frown , but then he shrugged it off . In 1903 , Caleb graduated from the Salter Academy . The day after his graduation Justin took him down to his office to show him around . By now , of course , the importing business was very different from what it had been in the ' do 's . The old fullriggedsteamers , which looked like brigantines with smokestacks ,  |p54had  given way to modern ships , and their spectacular journeys to Brazil and Peru and the West Indies had been discontinued in favor of the more profitable coastwise hauls , carrying manufacturedgoods south and raw materials north . The Merchants ' Exchange had been torn down ; Caleb would be spending his days in an office above a warehouse , behind a roll-top desk , dealingwith ledgers and receipts and bills of lading . Still , it was a fine opportunity for a young man with ambition , Caleb . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , through which he had been gazing even though it was impossible to see the harbor from there . He said that he would prefer to be a musician . At first Justin could n't take it in . He was politely interested . Musician ? Whatever for ? Then the situation hit him in the face and he gasped and caved in . He felt for the chair behind him and sat down , preparingbitter , harmful words that would convey all his horror and disgust and contempt . But music was so  --  no young man would ever seriously  --  music was for women ! For parlors ! He felt nauseated by the sight of this boy 's intense brown eyes . He could hardly wait to chew him up and spit him out and stamp on what was left . Instead , all that came from his mouth were strange vowel sounds over which he had no control . He had to be carried away in his office chair by two men from the warehouse . They laid him in his buggy and folded both arms across his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then Caleb drove him home . When Laura came to the door she found Caleb on the topmost step with his father curled in his arms like a baby . But Justin 's eyes were two hard , glittering pebbles , and she could feel his rage . " What happened ? " she asked , and Caleb told her , straight out , while struggling upstairs with his burden to Justin 's high carved bed . Laura 's face grew as dark as coffee but she said not a word . She had the kitchen maid fetch the doctor from down the street , and she listened stonily to the doctor 's diagnosis : apoplexy , brought on by a shock of some sort . He did not hold out much hope for recovery . If Justinp55lived , he said , one side would likely be paralyzed , although it was too soon to say for certain . Then Laura went downstairs to the parlor where Caleb stood waiting . " You have killed your half of your father , " she said . On Monday , Caleb started work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finished his courses at the Universityin record time and was now preparing himself further by working at the offices of Norris &; Wiggen , a fine old respectable law firm . He lived at home and often relieved Laura at his father 's sickbed , reading aloud to him from the newspaper or from Laura 's enormous Bible . Justin would lie very still with one fist clenched , his flinty blue eyes glaring at the wall . He had not recovered the use of his left side . It was apparent suddenly that he was a very old man , with liver spots across his dry forehead and claws for hands . Half of his face seemed to be melting and running downward . He spoke only with difficulty , and when people misunderstood he would fly into a rage . Because he could not bear to have his weakness observed by the outside world ( which would take advantage immediately , he was certain of it ) , he had determined to stay in his bedroom until he was fully recovered . For he assumed that he was suffering only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a worsethan-uselessdoctor and a half-wit wife . Therefore he undertook his own cure . He had all the panes in his windows replaced with amethyst glass , which was believed to promote healing . He drank his water from a quassia cup and ordered Laura to send away for various nostrums advertised in the newspaper  --  celery tonic , pectoral syrup , a revitalizing electric battery worn on a chain around the neck . His only meat was squirrel , easiest on the digestive tract . Yet still he remained flat on his back , whiteningand shriveling like a beached fish . On Friday nights Caleb came and summarized the week 's business in a gentle , even voice , directing his statements to the foot of the bed . Justin looked at the wall , pretending not to hear . As a matter of fact it seemed that Caleb was handling everythingquite adequately , but it was too late now . The time forp56that was past , there was no undoing what had been done . Justin went on looking at the wall until Caleb left . Laura brought out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reflect passers-by on the street below . She thought he might like to keep in touch with things . But when Justin turned his face to the busybody he saw Caleb just descendingthe front steps , turned faded and remote and long-ago by the blue glass of the windowpanes . He told Laura to take her nonsense elsewhere . In February , 1904 , the Great Fire burned out the heart of Baltimore , sweeping away every tall building in the city and most major businesses , including Justin Peck 's . When it was over Justin insisted upon being taken to see the damage for himself . His sons carried him to the buggy and drove him downtown , through the peculiar yellowish light that hung over everything . It was the first trip Justin had made since his illness . From the satisfied look he gave to the rubble and the littered streets and the jagged remains of walls , it seemed that he credited the destructionnot to fire but to his own absence . Without him Baltimorehad gone up in smoke . Under Caleb 's care the warehouse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roll-top desk had dissolved into ashes . He turned to Daniel with a crooked , bitter smile and waved his good hand to be taken home again . Now he developed a new obsession : he wanted to leave this combustible city entirely and build further north , way out on Falls Road . He dreamed his room was alight with flames and not a member of his family would come to rescue him . He called in the night for Laura , whose bed he had left some fifteen years ago following her third miscarriage , and he made her sleep by his side with her hand on a brass bell from India . He jarred her awake periodically and sent her out to the hall to sniff for fire . And Caleb , who was working around the clock to rebuild the warehouse , had to come to his father 's room every evening and listen to interminable garbled , stammered instructions for the buying of land in Roland Park . Nowadays Caleb always smelled of smoke from the city and he moved in a deep , tired daze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until his sooty white shirt appeared to have nothing inside it , while his father wove his tangled mat of words : builders , masons , two fire , two fireproof houses . Two ? Well , Justin figured Daniel would be marrying Margaret Rose Bell . Now Margaret Rose Bell was a Washington girl who had come to spend the winter with her cousins , the Edmund Bells . And although it was true that she and Daniel were often seen together , the fact was that she was not yet eighteen years old , and Daniel was still working at Norris &; Wiggen . Customarily a man would wait till he was able to buy and furnish a house by himself before he would take a wife . Yes , but Justin planned to have a great many descendants and he was anxious to get them started . Land was purchased in Roland Park . Master builders were hired to supervise the construction of two large houses set side by side , with almost no space between them , although great stretches of land lay all about . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wedding dress with one hundred and eight pearl buttons running down the back . They were married in the summer . Because the houses were not yet finished Margaret moved into Daniel 's boyhood room , where his wooden-wheeled roller skates sat next to his shelf of lawbooks . She was a small , vivid girl who generally wore dresses of soft material like flower petals , and at any moment of the day she could be seen running up and down the stairs , or flinging open windows to watch some excitement in the streets , or dartinginto Justin 's room to see if he needed anything . At the sight of her Justin would begin blinking and nodding in his doddering old man 's way , and he would go on nodding and nodding and nodding long after she had kissed the top of his head and left again . Oh , he had n't been mistaken , Margaret Rose was what this house had needed . And she would be certain to provide descendants . Why , by the fall of 1905 , when Justin Peck 's golden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Roland Park , Margaret Rose was already holding a baby in her lap and expecting another . Things were working out just fine . Everything was going according to plan . By I9o8 they had bought a snorting black Model T Ford with a left-hand steering wheel and splashless flower vases . Each morning the two brothers rode off to work in it  --  handsome young men in hats and high white collars . Daniel had his own law office now , a walnut-paneled suite of rooms with an oil portrait of his father over the mantel . He was taking on no partners because , he said , he wanted to have his sons for partners , not just anyone . And Caleb had rebuilt his father 's warehouse , bigger and better than before . He had a brand new roll-top desk with twice as many cubbyholes . Whenever Caleb chose to marry , another house would be built beside the first two , but meanwhile he lived at home with his parents . He was a quiet man who became quieter every year . It was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troubledanyone and he never became rowdy or noisy . In fact Margaret Rose said she wished he would get noisy , once in a while . She was fond of Caleb . Between them they had a few old jokes , which would cause Margaret to laugh in her low , chuckly way until Caleb , in spite of himself , would let his own mouth turn up shyly at the corners . He would come talk to her in her shady back yard , waiting patiently through all her children'sinterruptions and requests and minor accidents . And several times she gave evening parties expressly to introduce Caleb to one or another of her pretty cousins . Girls always liked Caleb . But though he might dance with them or take them for a drive , he did n't seem interested in marriage . More often now he stayed home in his room , or he toured the taverns , or he went someplace else , no one knew where . Really , not even Margaret Rose could say for sure what Caleb did with himself . For Christmas one year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She thought it would be the perfect gift for someone so musical . Along with it came disc recordings of Caruso , Arturo Toscanini , and Jan Kubelik on the violin . Butp59these discs affected Caleb the way formal concerts did ; he becamerestless and absent-minded and unhappy . He started pacingacross the carpet and up and down the hall and eventually straight through the front door and out of sight , and was not seen again for the remainder of the day . So the Graphophone was never taken up to his bedroom , as Margaret had intended , but drifted into Justin 's room instead , where it amused the old nian for hours on end . He seemed particularly fond of Caruso . He would order Margaret to stand beside his bed cranking the machine and changing the heavy black discs . Margaret was surprised . If this was the way he felt , why had he forbidden Caleb'sMUSIC t USlc in the house ? For Caleb continued to spend all his money on musical instruments  --  woodenflutes and harmonicas and cellos and even stringed gourds that only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his room , but he was not allowed to sound a iicite on them where Justin could hear . In fact , even the piano was forbidden . now , and had been exiled to Daniel 's house , where Margaret Rose could tinkle out Czerny without disturbingher father-in-law . If Caleb wanted to make music he had to go far away , usually to the old Samson stable on the other side of a field . He would sit in the loft door blowing whistles or sawing out stringy little street tunes , and only wisps of his music drifted up to the house , never as far as Justin 's densely curtained sickroom . Yet Justin always seemed to know when Caleb had been playing , and he would turn his face away irritably when Caleb stopped by later to offer his meticulous , patient account of the previous week 's business . Meanwhile Daniel 's house was filling up with children , and his practice was swelling , and he already had it in the back of his mind to become a judge someday while his sons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home evenings , and Margaret ran up in her rustling , flowery dress to fling her arms around him , he would be remote and sometimes annoyed . His head was still crowded with torts and claims and statutes . He would set her gently aside and continue toward his study at the rear of thep60house . So for someone to talk to , Margaret tried giving afternoontea parties . She invited her cousins and her girlfriends , who came tumbling in crying , " Maggie ! Maggie Rose ! " and kissing both her cheeks in the new way they had learned from Aunt Alice Bell , who had recently been to Paris . But Daniel said that he was not partial to these affairs . Oh , in the evening maybe , clients or business friends occasionally . . . he did n't want to be unreasonable , he said , but actually he expected his home to be a refuge from the outside world . And nowadays when he came in from a hard day 's work he would be sure to find some unknown lady sitting on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dining room buffet beneath Sarah Cantleigh 's portrait , and once even the brass paperweight moved to the other side of his blotter , when everyone knew that his desk was forbidden territory . Besides , did n't she think she would be better off devoting those hours to her children ? They had six children . In 1905 Justin II was born , in 1906 Sarah , in 1907 Daniel Jr. , in 19o8 Marcus , in i 9o9 Laura May , in 191 o Caroline . In 1911 , Margaret Rose left home . She had wanted to take the children to Washington on the train for her mother 's birthday . Daniel did n't think she ought to . After all , she was a Peck now . What did she want with the Bells ? Who at any rate were an undisciplined , frivolous , giggling lot . She said she would go anyway . Daniel pointed out that she was her own mistress , certainly , as everyone in his family had noticed more than once , but the children were his . And sure enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staring up at her , all Peck , blue Peck eyes and hair that matched their skin , solemn measuring Peck expressions , not a trace of Margaret Rose . She could go , Daniel said , but she could n't take the children . And he expected her back on Saturday evening , as there was church to attend Sunday morning . She went . Saturday evening Caleb met the train but Margaret was not on it . When Daniel found out he merely pressed his lips togetherand walked away . Later he was heard telling his mother'sp61servant Sulie to put the children to bed . Apparently no inquiries were going to be made . On Wednesday Daniel received a letter from Margaret 's father . He wrote in brown ink . Everyone knew that ink , becausewhen Margaret 's father wrote she would race through the house reading passages to different people and laughing at the funny parts . But Daniel read this letter in silence , and then went up to his room . When he came down again nothing at all was said about it . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The baby stopped crying and the older ones went back to their games and nursery rhymes . Only Caleb seemed to remember Margaret Rose . He went up to Daniel one day and asked him point blank why he did n't go after her . Or Caleb himself would , though Daniel would be better . Daniel looked straight through him . Then Caleb went to Justin , who certainly loved Margaret Rose too and used to wait every day for the fluttering of her petal skirts against the banister . Now Justin merely closed his eyes and pretended not to hear . " But why ? " Caleb asked him . " Do n't you care ? Life is not the same here when Maggie Rose is gone . " In all the accounts of the family history , told by all the aunts and uncles and upstairs maids , that was the only direct quotationof Caleb 's that was ever handed down . Two generations later it was to ring in Justine 's ears like poetry , taking on more depth and meaning than Caleb had probably intended . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept his eyes shut very tightly and waited for his son to leave . Now Laura ran both households , upright and energetic as ever in her ugly brown dresses with her hair screwed back so tightly it stretched her eyes . To the Peck children she was the center of the universe , sometimes the only family member they saw for clays . Justin was too old and sick to be bothered , and Daniel hardly ever came home before their bedtime . As for Caleb , he kept to himself . They might catch sight of him striking out across the field toward the Samson stable , the sunlight pale onp62his Panama hat ; or leaving for work in the morning , already tired and beaten-looking ; or returning late in the evening with his manner of walking curiously careful . He never played with them . Sometimes on those extra-careful evenings he even got their names confused . He did nothing to earn their attention . So they failed to notice how he appeared to be dimming and wearingthrough , almost transparent ; and how his only friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the music from the stable had thinned and shredded until you almost could n't hear it . Laura noticed . But what could it mean ? She pondered over his long , unbreakable silences , the likes of which she had not seen before and would not again until the days of Caleb 's great-nephew Duncan , as yet unborn and unthought of . She tried to shame him into more normal behavior . " Where is your common courtesy ? At least think of the family . " But he would only wander off , not hearing , and sometimes he would not reappearfor days . On a Saturday afternoon " in the spring of 19 12 , Daniel was standing at the bay window watching Justin Two ride his bicycle . It was a heavy black iron one , hard for Two to manage , but he had just got the hang of it and he teetered proudly down the driveway . From out of nowhere , Daniel saw a small , clear picture of Caleb on his velocipede merrily pedaling after a flutiston a sidewalk in old Baltimore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house and crossed the yard to his mother 's and climbed the stairway to Caleb 's room . But Caleb was not there . Nor was he in the kitchen , where he most often ate his meals ; nor anywhere else in the house , nor outdoors nor in the stable . And the Ford was parked in the side yard ; he would n't be downtown . Daniel felt uneasy . He asked the others  --  the childrenand Laura . They did n't know . In fact , the last time anyonecould remember for sure he had been walking off down the driveway three days earlier , carrying his fiddle . The children saw him go . " Goodbye now , " he called to them . " Goodbye , Uncle Caleb . " But of course that did n't mean a thing , he would surelyp63have . . . Daniel went to Justin 's room . " I ca n't find Caleb , " he said . Justin turned his face away . " Father ? I ca n't  --  " A long , glittering tear slid down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was beginning to let his mind go . Years later , whenever he was fixing some family event in its proper time slot , Daniel Peck would pause and consider the importance of 1912 . Could there be such a thing as an unlucky number ? ( Justine would look up briefly , but say nothing . ) For in 1912 it seemed that the Peck family suddenly cracked and flew apart like an old china teacup . First there was Caleb 's disappearance , without a trace except for a bedroom full of hollow , ringing musical instruments anda roll-top desk with an empty whisky bottle in the bottom drawer . So then they had to sell the business , Justin 's last link with the outside world . And after that Justin started dying , leaving his family in the same gradual , fading way that Caleb had until it was almost no shock at all to find him lifeless in his bed one morning with his bluish nose pointing heavenward . In the winter of 1912 there was another envelope from Washington addressed in brown ink . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rose had been killed in a fire . They were to pray for her to be forgiven . Now her children wore brown to school and could properly be called poor motherless orphans , although they continued to look surprised whenever some well-meaning lady told them so . They were calm , docile children , a little lacking in imagination but they did well in their lessons . They did not seem to have suffered from all that had happened . Nor did Laura , who continued as spry and capable as ever . Nor Daniel , of course  --  a man of even temper . Although sometimes , late at night , he would take the Ford and drive aimlessly over the moonlit roads , often ending up in the old section of the city where he had no business any more , and knew no one , and heard nothing but the faint , musicalwhistling of the streetcar wires in the dark sky overhead.  |p64JusTINE  'S CHILDHOOD was dark and velvety and it smelled of dust . There were bearded men under all the furniture , particularlyher bed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the blackness , but when it was open the knob stuck out exactly like a shotgun barrel sidling through to aim at her head , and she would have to lie motionless for hours pretending to be a wrinkle in the blankets . In the mornings her father was away , either at the office or out of town , and her mother was in bed with a sick headache , and , Justine sat in the living room with the curtains shut so that even to herself she was only a pale glimmer . She was waiting for the maid . First there was the scrabbling of the key in the apartment door and then light , air , motion , the rustle of Claudia 's shopping bag and her thin cross mosquito voice . " Now what you doing sitting there ? What you up to ? What you doing sitting in that chair ? " She would yank the curtains open and there was the city of Philadelphia , a wide expanse of blackened brick apartment houses and dying trees in cages and distant factory smokestacks . Then she would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two skinny braids that she called plaits . " Do n't you go getting that dress dirty . Do n't you go messing yourself up , I 'll tell Miss Caroline on you . " By that time maybe her mother 's headache would be lifting , at least enough so that her parched voi ( Ze could trail out from the bedroom . " Justine ? Are n't you even going to say good morning ? " Although not an hour ago she had buried her face in the pillow and waved Justineaway with one shaky , pearl-studded hand . Justine 's mother wore fluffy nightgowns with eyelet ruffles at the neck . Her hair was the color of Justine 's but tightly curled . She was the youngest of Daniel Peck 's six children , the baby . Even total strangers could guess that , somehow , from her small , pursed mouth and her habit of ducking her chin whenp65talking to people . Unfortunately she tended to put on weighthen unhappy , and she had become a plump , powdery , pouchy woman with her rings permanently embedded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being exiled in Philadelphia . She had never guessed , when agreeing to marry Sam Mayhew , that t he Depression would close down the Baltimore branch of his company just six months after the wedding . If she had had any inkling , she said  --  but she did n't finish the sentence . She just retched for another chocolate , or a petit-four , or one of the Fink-frosted cupcakes she grew more and more to resemble . But Justine loved her mother 's soft skin and her puffy bosom and the dimples on the backs of her hands . She liked to huddle beneath the drooping velvet canopy of the bed , which was her mother 's real home , surrounded by a circle of chocolate boxes , empty teacups , ladies ' magazines , and cream-colored lettersfrom Baltimore . Of course there were days when her mother was up and about , but Justine pictured her only in the dint rosy glow of the bedside lamp . She dwelt on the suspense of entering that room : was she welcome this time , or was n't she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ca n't you let me be ? " or wept into her pillow and would n't speak at all ; but ether days she called , " Is that my Justine ? Is that my fairy angel ? Do n't you have one tiny kiss for your poor mama ? " And she would sit up and scoop Justine into a spongy , perfumed embrace , depriving her of breathing room for a moment , not that it mattered . Then she flung back the ruffled pink sleeves of her bedjacket and taught Justine the games she had played when she was a child  --  cat 's cradle and Miss Fancy 's Come to Town and the doodle story , where you drew a map that turned out to be a goose . Or she would have Justine fetch scissors and she would cut , from the Baltimore newspapers , folded stars and paper dolls with pigtails and standing angels made from a circle cleverly slashed here and there as only she knew how . She would tell true stories , better than anything in books : How Uncle Two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Burglar , How the Mayhews ' Ugly Dog Buttons Ate My WeddingDress . She told how Justine was born in Baltimore thanksp66to split-second timing and not in Philadelphia as everyone had feared . " Well , luckily I had my way , " she said . " You know how your daddy is . He did n't understand at all . When you started coming two months early I said , Sam , put me on that train , ' but he would n't do it . I said , Sam , what will Father say , he 's made all the arrangements at Johns Hopkins ! ' I just hope he did n't lay down a deposit , ' your daddy said . So I picked up my suitcase that I had all ready and waiting and I said , Listen here , Sam Mayhew . . . ' " At six in the evening Claudia would leave , slamming the door behind her , and Justine 's mother would look at the clock and her fingers would fly to her mouth . " How in the world did the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would slide to the edge of the bed and feel for her pink satin slippers . " We ca n't let your daddy catch us lazing about like this . " She would put on a navy blue dress with shoulder pads , and cover her rosebud mouth with dark lipstick , turning instantly from pink-and-gold to a heavy , crisply defined stranger like the ones hurrying down the sidewalk five stories below . " Of course my headache has n't improvedone bit , " she would say . " I 'd go back to bed but your daddy would never understand . He does n't believe in headaches . He certainly does n't believe in going to bed for them . It just is not his custom , I suppose . " To hear her talk , you would think Sam Mayhew was as different and exotic as an Asian prince , but he was only a small pudgy man with a Baltimore accent . Then there were days in a row when Justine was not allowed in her mother 's room at all , when she would puzzle and puzzle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No one could go in but Claudia , carrying the latest string-tied box from the Parisian Pastry Co . Justine was marooned on ascratchy brocade chair in the living room and the bearded men beneath it were only waiting for her to lower one foot so that they could snatch her by the ankle and drag her down . Even . Sam Mayhew 's homecoming could not rouse his wife from bed . " Oh , go away , Sam , let me be , ca n't you see a crack is running down in front of my ears ? " Sam and Justine ate supper alone ,  |p67on  the gold-rimmed plates that Claudia had laid out in the diningroom . " Well , now , Justine , what have you been doing with vourself ? " Sam would ask . " Did Claudia take you to the playgroundDid you have a nice time on the swings ? " But he would quickly flounder and drown in her blank , astonished stare . Day after day Justine on her brocade island looked at her mother 's old Books of Knowledge  --  tattered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could reach without settinga foot to the floor . She lost herself in a picture of a train heading through outer space . It had been explained to her that this picture demonstrated the impossibility of man 's ever reachingthe moon . See how long it would take to cover the distance , even by rail ? But to Justine it appeared all too easy , and she felt herself lightening and dwindling and growing dizzy whenever she saw that tiny lone train curving through the endless blackness . Finally a time would come when she could raise her eyes from a page and find the air parting expectantly to make way for some change ; she could always tell when change was coming . And not long afterward the telephone would ring , and Claudia would carry it from the foyer to the bedroom and rouse Justine 's mother to shout long distance to Baltimore . " Hello ? Oh , Father ! Why are you  --  did Sam tell you to call me ? What ? Oh , not too well , I 'm afraid . I said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I ca n't quite . " Justine would listen carefully , trying to discover exactly what had caused her world to collapse . She heard that her mother 's nerves were acting up , her headaches were ferocious and no doctor could do a thing , the chandelier had fallen smack out of the ceiling , the landlord was impossible , Claudia showed no respect , there had been a very depressing story in the paper Sunday , Justine was turning sulky , Sam was out of town too much , and really it was entirely the fault of the City of Philadelphia . If he had any feeling , if he cared even a little , she knew it was asking a lot but she wished he would come and straighten things out.  |p68He  always came . She was his youngest daughter after all and very far from home , the only one of his children to leave the safety of Roland Park . Which was not to say that he approved of her . Oh , no . As soon as he stepped in the door , late that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the welter of pastry boxes and her crumb-littered , used-looking bed , and he was telling her outright that she had grown too fat . " Yes , Father , " Caroline said meekly , and she sat a little straighter and sucked in her stomach . The next morning , when Justine got up unusually late after an unusually calm , dreamless sleep , she would find the apartmentbright with sun and all the curtains open . Claudia was wearing a crisp white scarf and briskly attacking the dust in the cushions . Her mother sat in the dining room fully dressed , eating fresh grapefruit . And in the foyer her grandfather stood at the telephone announcing that he , Judge Peck , would personally drag the landlord through the entire United States judiciary system if that chandelier were not replaced by twelve noon sharp . Then he hung up and cupped Justine 's head with his right hand , which was his way of greeting her . He was a bony man in a three-piece pinstriped suit , with fading hair like aged gardenia petals and a gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had brought her a sack of horehound drops . He always did . Justine was certain that no matter what , even if he had rushed here through fires and floods and train wrecks , he would not forget to stop at Lexington Market first for a sack of horehound drops and he would not fail to cup her head in that considering way of his when he had arrived . Generally during those visits Sam Mayhew would vanish , or if he did come home he wore a gentle , foolish smile and tried to keep out of the way . At any rate , the grandfather was never there for very long . He was a busy man . He came up over the weekend usually , just long enough to get his daughter to her feet again , and he left Sunday evening . Only once did he come on a working day . That was for Justine . She was supposed to be starting kindergarten , the first time she would ever be away from home alone . She refused to go . She would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her mother gave in , sensing that there was no use arguing with her . The next morning when Justine awoke her grandfather Peck was standing by her bed carrying her plaid dress , her ruffled underpantswith " Tuesday " embroidered on them and her lace-edged socks . He dressed her very slowly and carefully . Justine would have refused even her grandfather but his hands were so thick and clumsy , untying the bow of her nightgown , and when he stooped to pick up her shoes she could see the pink scalp through his thin pale hair . He even did her braids , though not very well . He even sat across from her and waited with perfect patience while she dawdled over breakfast . Then he helped her with her coat and they left , passing her mother , who wrung her hands in the doorway . They went down streets that were bitterlyfamiliar , where she had shopped with her mother in the dear , safe days before school was ever thought of . At a square brick building her grandfather stopped . He pointed out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cupped her head briefly and then , after some fumbling and rustling , pushed a sack of horehound drops at her and gave her a little nudge in the direction of the brick building . When she had climbed the steps she looked back and found him still waiting there , squintingagainst the sunlight . Forever after that , the dark , homely , virtuous taste of horehound drops reminded her of the love and sorrow that ached in the back of her throat on that first day in the outside world . In summer the leather suitcases would come up in the elevator to be packed , and Justine and her parents would board the eveningtrain to Baltimore . Their arrival was never clear to Justine . She was half asleep , carried off the train and laid in the arms of some white-suited uncle . But when she awoke the next day there she was in Roland Park , all rustling with trees and twitteringwith birds , in her great-grandmother 's white brick house , and if she went to the window she knew that all the houses within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of shiny black V-8 Fords lining one side of the street , and all the littlep70blond heads dotting the lawn were Peck cousins waiting for her to come out and play . Her mother would be talking in the dining room , but such a different mother  --  twinkling and dimpling and telling terrible giggling stories about Philadelphia . Aunts would be grouped around her , drinking their fifth and sixth cups of coffee . Aunt Sarah and Aunt Laura May were spinsters and still lived next door in the grandfather 's house along with the bachelor Uncle Dan . Uncle Two 's wife Lucy and Uncle Mark 's wife Bea were Pecks by marriage only , and lived in the other two houses . They were not as important as the true Peck aunts , but then they were the mothers of the cousins . And of course , presiding over everyone was the great-grandma , a tidy , brownish woman . The white rims showing beneath her irises gave her a look of reproach , but as soon as she saw Justine she smiled and the rims disappeared . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meat , three kinds of pastry , and a platter of scrambled eggs  --  but Justine was n't hungry . " Naturally , " her mother said , laughing her summer laugh , " she 's anxious to see her cousins , " and she tied Justine 's sash and gave her a pat and sent her off . Justine had six cousins . All of them looked like her and talked like her , all of them knew the story of how Grandfather Peck had fooled the burglar . It was very different from Philadelphia , where her mother , coming to the school play , referred to " that dark little boy " and asked , " Who was the child who spoke with such a nasal twang ? " With her cousins , there was no need to worry . Baltimore was the only place on earth where Justine would not be going over to the enemy if she agreed to play Prisoner 's Base . Yet even here , was n't she an outsider of sorts ? Her last name was Mayhew . She lived in Philadelphia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And though they drew her into every game , she had the feeling that they were trying to slow down for her in some way . She envied them their quick , bubblinglaughter and their golden tans . Occasionally , for one split second , , she allowed herself to imagine her parents painlessly dead and some uncle or other adopting her , changing her namep71to Peck and taking her to live forever in Roland Park with its deep curly shadows and its pools of sunlight . At such times Aunt Bea , coming out to the front porch to shade her eyes and check the children , would smile and sigh over poor little plain Justine , whose pointed face was wisped with anxiety so that it looked like crazed china or something cobwebbed or netted . And who ran so artificially , so hopefully , at the edge of the other children 's games , kicking her heels up too high behind her . In the evening they all went home . The four houses gave the illusion of belonging to four separate families . But after supperthey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the men in their shirtsleeves and the women in fresh print dresses . The children grew overexcited rolling down the slope together . They quarreled and were threatened with an early bedtime , and finally they had to come sit with the grownups until they had calmed down . Sweaty and panting , choking back giggles , itchy from the grass blades that stuck to their skin , they dropped to the ground beside their parents and looked up at the stars while low measured voices murmured all around them . The oldest cousin , Uncle Mark 's daughter Esther , held her little brother Richard on her lap and tickled him secretly with a dandelion clock . Nearby , Esther 's twin sisters , Alice and Sally , were curled together like puppies with Justine in the middle because she was new and special . And Uncle Two 's boys , Claude and Duncan , wrestled without a sound and without a perceptible movement so they would n't be caught and sent to bed . Not that the grownups really cared . They were piecing together some memorynow , each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see how it would turn out . Long after the children had grown calm and loose and dropped off to sleep , one by one , the grownups were still weaving family history in the darkness . In the winter of 1942 , when Justine was nine , her father left for the war . The apartment was dismantled , a moving van came , and Justine and her mother took the train to Baltimore . Her mother cried all the way down . When they arrived she spilled out of thep72train and into her sisters ' arms , still weeping , with her curls plastered to her face and her nose as pink as a rabbit 's . Her sisters looked flustered and kept searching their purses for fresh hankies . The situation was new to them ; no Peck had ever gone to war . It was believed that old Justin had mysteriously avoided the Civil War altogether , while every member of the family after him had possessed a heart murmur of such obviousness that they had been excused from even the mildest sports , the women cautioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marches and the violence of travel by the unique , hollowstutter in their chests . Which did not prevent them from standing in a semicircle , bright-eyed and healthy and embarrassed , around their baby sister in the railroad station . It was their father who finally took charge . " Come , come , " he said , and he herded them out of the station and into the line of Fords at the curb . Justine and her mother rode in his car , at the head of the procession . Justine 's mother kept sniffing . Nothing irritatedGrandfather Peck more than the sound of someone sniffing . " Look here , Caroline . We people do n't cry . Get a hold of yourself , " he said . " I ca n't help it , Father . I just ca n't help it . I keep thinking of ways I could have been nicer to him . I mean I was never exactly  --  and I 'm just certain he 's going to be killed . " " He wo n't be killed , " said Justine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's house , since it had the most room . Justine was entered in the girls ' school that Esther and the twins attended . Bit by bit she forgot almost completely the dark , bearded world of Philadelphia , and her mother grew carefree and girlish . Her mother seldom mentioned Sam Mayhewany more but she wrote him dutifully once a week , saying everyone was fine and sent him best regards . Only Justine , lookingup sometimes from The Five Little Peppers or a game of backgammon , had a sudden picture of Sam Mayhew 's sad , kind face and wondered if she had not missed out on something , choosing to be her mother 's child alone . Yet there were her cousins , always embarked on some newp73project . Esther wrote plays and her twin sisters shared a single role , speaking in unison . Justine played the princess in Aunt Laura May 's blood-red lipstick . Little Richard would take any part you gave him , he was so happy to be included . And Uncle Two 's son Claude was fat and studious ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horror stories in a hair-raising whisper in the gloom of the pantry stairwell . But Duncan Peck was an evil , evil boy , and all his cousins worshipped him . Duncan was prankish and reckless and wild . He had a habit of disappearing . ( Long after she was grown , Justine could still close her eyes and hear his mother calling him  --  a soft-voiced lady from southern Virginia but my , could n't she sing out when she had to ! " Dun-KUNN ? Dun-KUNN ? " floated across the twilit lawn , with no more response than a mysterious rustle far away or a gleam of yellow behind the trees , rapidly departing . ) While the rest of the cousins seemed content to have only one another for friends , Duncan was always dragging in strangers and the wrong kind of strangers at that , ten-year-old boys with tobacco breath and BB guns and very poor grammar . His cousinstook piano lessons and hammered out " Country Gardens " faithfully for one half hour a day , but all Duncan would play was a dented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whistles and a chucka-chucka and a countrysoundingtwang that delighted the children and made the grownups flinch . His great-grandma complained that he was impudentand dishonest . It was perfectly obvious that he was lying to any adult who asked him a question , and his lies were extreme , an insult to the intelligence . Also he was accident-prone . To his cousins that was the best part of all . How did he find so many accidents to get into ? And such gory ones ! He never just broke a bone , no , he had to have the bone sticking out , and all his cousins crowding around making sick noises and asking if they could touch it . He was always having a finger dangle by one thread , a concussion that allowed him to talk strangely and draw absolutely perfect freehand circles for one entire day , a purple eye or an artery opened or a tooth knocked horizontalp74and turning black . And on top of all that , he was never at a loss for something to do . You would never see hint lolling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had his own ideas , none of which she approved of . His mind was a flash of light . He knew how to make the electric fan drive Richard 's little tin car , he could build traps for animals of all kinds including humans , he had invented a dive-proof kite and a written code that looked like nothing but slants and uprights . Tangled designs for every kind of machine littered his bedroom floor , and he had all those cousins just doting on him and anxious to do the manual labor required . If he had been a cruel boy , or a bully , they never would have felt that way , but he was n't . At least not to them . It was the grownups he was cruel to . Justine once saw him hanging from a tree limb , upside down , when the family was out on a picnic . He was safe but Aunt Lucy fretted anyway . " Dun-KUNN ? I want you down from there ! " she called . All Duncan did was unwrap one leg from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angle , with his arms folded . Aunt Lucy rose and began running in ridiculous circles just beneath him , holding out her hands . Duncan grabbed the limb again  --  was he going to give in ? What a disappointment !  --  but no , he was only readjusting himself so that now he could hang by his feet . All that supported him were his insteps , and it was not the kind of limb you could do that from . He folded his arms again and looked at his mother with a cool , taunting , upside-down stare that gave Justine a sudden chill . Yet was n't Aunt Lucy laughable  --  flitting here and there crying , " Oh ! Oh ! " in a rusty scream . All the cousins had to giggle . Their grandfather set down his deviled egg and rose . " Duncan Peck ! " he shouted . " Come down here this instant ! " Duncan came down on the top of his head and had to go to the emergency room . Aunt Lucy , knitting soldiers ' socks with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son turn out this way . She considered all his flaws of character , his disgraceful report cards and the teachers ' complaints . ( He could n't spell worth beans , they said , and had never learned that neatnessp75counted . As for his papers , while there was no denying that they were ah , imaginative , at least what parts were readable , his hasty scrawl and his lack of organization and his wild swooping digressions left serious doubts as to his mental stability . ) Now , where did all that come from ? She reflected on her pregnancy : during her afternoon naps , she and the unborn Duncan had had , why , battles ! for a comfortable position . Whenever she lay on her back , so the baby rested on the knobs of her spine , he would kick and protest until she gave in and shifted to her side . Of course she had only Claude to compare him with , but she had wondered even at the time : would n't the average baby merely have moved to a more comfortable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shook their heads . The cousins , who had been eavesdropping in a row beneath the window , were very interested in pregnancy , but Duncan had a plan to weld all their bicycles together in a gigantic tandem and they could n't stay to hear more . When Sam Mayhew returned , his manufacturing company had reopened its Baltimore offices . There was no need to move back to Philadelphia . There was no need even to buy a place of their own , as his wife pointed out . Why bother , when GreatGrandmahad three full stories in which she rattled around with no one but old Sulie the maid for company ? So they stayed on in the white brick house in Roland Park , and Sam Mayhew rode downtown every day in a V-8 Ford behind his brothers-in-law . The Ford was a homecoming gift from the grandfather , who always had owned Fords and always would . To tell the truth , Sam Mayhew would have preferred a Desoto . And he would have liked to buy a house in Guilford , which was where his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents any more . But he was not a stubborn man and in the end he agreed to everything , only fading more and more into the background and working longer and longer hours . Once he took a three-day business trip and when he came home , only Sulie noticed he hadbeen away . And that was because she had to count out the place settings for dinner every night .  |p76His  daughter , Justine , who had been undersized and pathe-i tic when he left , was now a tall narrow beige girl . She had changed into one of those damned Pecks , clannish and secretive with a veiled look in her eyes , some sort of private amusement showing when she watched an outsider . And Sam was an outsider . Not that she was rude to him . All the Peck girls had excellentmanners . But he knew that he had lost her , all right . " What do those damned kids do all day ? Do n't they have any outside friends ? " he asked his wife . " Oh , they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said serenely . And she smiled out across the lawn at her brittle spinster sisters and her stuffy brothers who were all dressed alike , all lawyers as their father had wished them to be , and at the two wives who might have been chosen merely for their ability to be assimilated . Who were chosen for that . He looked down suddenlyat his own colorless suit , so baggy that it seemed to be uninhabited . Then he sighed and walked away . Nobody noticed him leaving . None of the girl cousins dated much in high school . At the mixers that were held with the boys ' school up the road they were thought to be standoffish . Especially Justine , whose tense , pinched face stopped most of the boys from asking her to dance . Sometimes Sally , the prettier of the twins , might circle the floor with someone , but she tipped her pelvis away stiffly and seemed relieved when the music was over . As for the boy cousins , only Duncan had a steady girlfriend . Duncan 's girlfriend was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when nice girls wore short skirts , Glorietta'sswirled just above her ankles . She had a tumbling waterfall of black hair and a beautiful vivid face . There appeared to be sugar crystals on her eyelashes . Her waist was tiny and her breasts precisely cone-shaped , like the radio speakers Duncan was constructing in his basement . Anyone who talked to her appeared to be talking into the speakers  --  Grandfather Peck included , as Justine noticed when Glorietta came for Sunday din/net . Duncan was the only one who enjoyed that dinner . Even Glorietta must have suspected that things were not going exactly right . For afterwards , she never was seen in any Peck house again . Instead she took up residence in Duncan 's car , a fortydollar1933 Graham Paige that smelled suspiciously of beer . Whenever the Graham Paige was parked outside , a green blemishin the row of Fords , you could glimpse a flash of Glorietta 's red dress through the window . When Duncan taught Justine to drive , Glorietta rode in the back like a lap robe or a Thermos bottle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her chewing gum , ignoring the shrieking gears and the quarrels and near accidents . Later , when Justine had learned the rudiments of driving , Duncan sat in the back as well . Justine could look in the rear view mirror and see his arm cocked carelessly around Glorietta'sneck , his face peaceful as he watched the passing scenery . She did not think she could ever be so relaxed with someone outside the family . Once for a school bazaar Justine was asked to run the fortune-telling booth , which she knew nothing about . A very peculiar old biology teacher sent her to a seeress named Olita . " She is any fortune teller , " she said , as if everyone should have one , " and she 'll teach you enough to get by . " Duncan and Glorietta drove Justine to a cleaner 's in east Baltimore and parked to wait for her . Olita had a room upstairs , behind aplate glass window reading MADAME oLITA , YOUR DESTINY DISCOVERED . Justine began to think this was n't such a good idea . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had changed her mind , but she found that Duncan was looking squarely at her , half smiling , with a spark in his eyes . It remindedher of the time he had hung from the tree limb . She went on up the stairs . Madame Olita was a large , sloping woman with a stubby gray haircut , wearing a grandmotherly dress and a cardigan . Her room , which was bare except for two stools and a table , smelled of steam from the cleaner 's . Since the biology teacher had called ahead , she already knew what Justine wanted . She had written out a list of things to tell people . " Palms will bep78simplest , " she said . " Palms take much less time than cards , and for a bazaar that 's all that counts . Just sound sure of yourself . Take their hands , like so . " She reached for Justine 's hand and turned it upward , smartly . " Start with the  --  you could be tellingfortunes yourself , if you wanted , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I mean seriously telling fortunes . You have the knack . " " Oh , " said Justine . " Well , I do n't think I  --  " " Do you ever have flashes when you know something is going to happen ? " " No ! Really , " said Justine . She pulled her hand away . " All right , all right . Here 's the list , then , of the major lines of the palm . Life , mind , heart , fate . . . " But later , when she had heaved herself up to see Justine to the door , she said , " This is really not a parlor game , you realize . " " No , I 'm sure it is n't , " Justine said politely . " You know it is n't . " Justine could n't think what was expected of her . She went on buttoning her coat . Madame Olita leaned forward and jabbed the back of Justine 's left hand with one stubby finger . " You have a curved ring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mystic cross , " she said . " I do ? " " Even one of those denotes a superior fortune teller . " Justine straightened her hat . " I have a mystic cross too , " said Madame Olita , " but I 've never found one on anybody else . They are very rare . May I see your right palm , please ? " Justine held it out , unwillingly . Madame Olita 's hands felt like warm sandpaper . " Well ? " Justine said finally . " You are very young , " Madame Olita told her . Justine opened the door to go . " But you 're going to enter into a marriage that will disrupt everything and break your parents ' hearts , " said Madame Olita. and when Justine spun around Madame Olita gave her a small , yellow smile and lifted a hand in farewell.  |p79Out  in the car , Duncan and Glorietta were kissing in broad daylight . " Stop that , " Justine said irritably , and Duncan broke away and looked up at her , surprised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rubbed off on her , so that Madame Olita had told the wrong person 's fortune . In the church hall after the sermon one Sunday a boy named Neely Carpenter asked Justine what time it was . " It 's approximatelytwelve thirteen and a half , " she told him . " Approxi 17ately twelve thirteen and a half ? " " My watch says that , you see , but my watch is a little off , " said Justine . " It 's logical , really . " She started laughing . Neely Carpenter , who had always thought of her as a spinster-faced girl , looked surprised for a moment and then asked if she would like a ride home from church . After that he gave her a ride every Sunday , and he took her to the movies every Saturday night . Justine 's mother said she thought that was very sweet . It was the fall of Justine 's senior year , after all ; she was seventeen . It was about time she had a steady boyfriend . And Neely was a doctor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy with very straight black hair and excellent manners . " Why do n't you invite this Neely boy for Sunday dinner ? " Justine 's mother asked her . Sunday dinner was always held at Great-Grandma 's house , with four leaves extending the table so that everyone could sit around it . Neely looked a little stunned when he saw how many Pecks there were , but he found a seat between Aunt Sarah and Uncle Dan and did his best to keep his place in the conversation . " Yes , ma'am . No , ma'am , " he kept saying . Justine thought he was doing fine . She was proud of her family , too  --  her aunts in their new rust-colored fall outfits , her handsome cousins , her stately grandfather with his hair turned silvery white and his face puzzled-looking from the effort he had started having to make in order to hear . So she was surprised when later , after Neely had gone home , Duncan said , " You 'll never see him , again . "  |p80They  were out on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Neely off and where Duncan , up to some projector other , was unrolling a gigantic reel of baling wire across the grass . When he raised his head to speak to her Justine was struck by his expression , which was almost the same as his grandfather 's . " Why do you say that ? " she asked him . " Nobody takes Sunday dinner with the Pecks and comes back for more . " " Well ! Just because Glorietta ! And besides , you 're wrong . He 's already asked me to Sue Pope 's birthday dance . " " Then he 's a fool , " said Duncan . " No , I do n't mean because of you , Justine . I mean , who would willingly mix with that crowd in the dining room ? " " I would , " said Justine . " I thought they were very nice to him . " " Ali , yes ! Ask if your little friend there would like another potato , Justine . ' Little friend ! And , Tell me , is it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public schools ? ' And , I understand your father is a doctor , urn , Reilly . How nice ! It 's a very rewarding profession , I hear , though a little  --  mechanical , do n't you think ? We are all lawyers , I suppose you know  --  ' " " What 's wrong with that ? They were only showing an interest , " Justine said . " Ho ! And then when he asked Great-Grandma if he could help to clear the dishes . Then he got it twice ! Oh , my , no , we have a servant , dear . ' And , Besides , ' Aunt Caroline says , it 's the very best china . ' " " Well ? " said Justine . " We do have a servant . And it was the best china . " Duncan stopped unreeling the baling wire . He straightened up and wiped his face on his sleeve . " You really do n't see it , do you , " he said . But Justine would n't answer . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the four brick houses behind them , where everybody was getting comfortable now with newspapers and needlework and cups of spiced tea . " You know what those houses remind me of ? " Duncan said , following herp81gaze . " Hamsters . Or baby mice , or gerbils . Any of those little animals that cluster in one corner piled on top of each other even when they have a great big cage they are free to spread out in . " " Oh , Duncan , " Justine said . She knew he only talked that way because he was going through a difficult time . Next year he would enter college and he wanted to go to Hopkins instead of the University and study science instead of law . But Grandfather Peck and the uncles kept arguing with him , nagging , pushing him . Of course he could study science , it was a free country , they said , but all the same there was something so materialistic about science , whereas law . . . " Peck , Peck , Peck &; Peck , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was actually called Peck &; Sons . " What a perfect name for them . " And he would shut himself away in his room , or go riding aimlessly with Glorietta so close beside him that if the Graham Paige were a matchbox ( which it almost appeared to be ) they would have tipped over long ago . So Justine did n't worry when he spoke so bitterly . And sure enough , Neely kept on asking her out . He never came to Sunday dinner again but that was because he really had to eat with his own family , he said . He did take her to movies and dances and birthday parties . He drove her home the long way around and parked some distance from the Pecks ' in order to kiss her good night . He asked if she would like to move to the back seat where they would be more comfortable . " Oh well , oh no  --  " said Justine , uncertain of the proper answer . She really did n't know what she was supposed to do in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , either . All they knew about sex was what Duncan had told them when he was eight ; that and the vague , horticultural-sounding information their mothers had given out . So Justine would flutter and debate with herself , but she always ended up saying , " Well actually I 'm very comfortablewhere I am but thank you just the  --  " Neely , who might have been uncertain too , would look almost relieved . Going home he hummed along with " Good Night , Irene " on the radio . He was starting to talk about their getting married someday ,  |p82after  he was through with medical school . Justine thought he was the best-looking boy in Roland Park and she liked his eyes , which were gray and translucent like quartz , and his quiet , level way of speaking . It was possible that she might even love him , but she did n't know what her mother would say . By the fall of I95I , Justine had started attending a girls ' junior college nearby . She thought she would do English or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Although she had always been a fair student she did n't have any real curiosity and she could n't think of any career she wanted to aim for . So she and Esther drifted off to college every day in the Ford their grandfather had bought them for commuting , their bright kerchiefs flickering and their hair whipping in the wind . Almost every evening Neely would come over ( he was at Hopkinsnow ) to study in the dining room with her . And there were still the Sunday dinners , the cousins alternating with grownups around the table to discourage mischief , and Claude 's round face shining with the relief of being home from the University even if just for a day . But Duncan ! Something came over Duncan that year . No one could quite put a finger on it . He had what he wanted , did n't he ? He was studying science at Hopkins , was n't he ? Yet it seemed sometimes that he was more dissatisfied than ever , almost as if he regretted winning . He complained about living at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so expensive . He said the expense was an excuse ; this was just the family 's way of punishinghim . Punishing ! To live at home with your own close family ? He was morose and difficult to talk to . He did not appearto have any friends at all , at least none that he would introduce , and Glorietta was no longer to be seen . Well , of course he had always been somewhat of a problem . Surely this was just another of his stages , the aunts told his mother . But then he started reading Dostoevsky . Naturally they had all read Dostoevsky  --  or at least the uncles had , in college . Or Crime and Punishment , at any rate . At least in the abridged edition . But this was different . Duncanp83did n't just read Dostoevsky ; he sank in , he buried himself in Dostoevsky , he stopped attending classes entirely and stayed in his room devouring obscure novels and diaries none of the rest of the family had heard of . On a soft spring evening , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buying a home freezer , Uncle Two 's branch of the family might be startled by the crash of enormous footsteps down the stairs and Duncan 's wild , wiry figure exploding into the living room to wave a book at them . " Listen ! Listen ! " and he would read out some passage too loudly and too quickly for them to follow . A jumble of extravagant Russian prose , where emotions were stated outright in a surprising way and a great many extreme adjectives were used and feverish fancies kept darting and flashing . Paragraphs were layered and dense and complicated like chunks of mica . " Did you bear ? " he shouted . His parents nodded and smiled , their embarrassed expressions giving them the look of sleepers dazzled by bright light . " Well then ! " he would say , and off he spun , up the stairs . His parents stared at each other . His father went to talk to the grandfather , who understood it no better . " But I thought he was scientific ! " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Ali well , never mind . At least it 's the classics , they surely ca n't hurt him . " But that was before Easter Sunday . On Easter Sunday , at the dinner table , the aunts were discussing Mrs. Norman Worth 's extensive collection of eggshell miniatures . The uncles were arguing the details of a hypothetical legal problem : If a farmer , while turning on the water to irrigate the fields , accidentallystartled another farmer 's mule , which , in turn , kicked down the fence enclosing a prize-winning Angus bull , who thereupon .. . " Neither of these subjects is fit table conversation , " Duncan said . Everybody thought about that for a minute . " But what 's wrong with them , dear ? " his mother said finally . " They 're not real . " Great-Grandma , who had lived longest and was hardest top84shock , poured more ice water into her tumbler . " To you they may not be , " she said , " but I myself find eggshell miniatures fascinating and if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself . " " You owe us an apology , Duncan boy , " said Uncle Two . " You owe we an apology , " said Duncan . " I 've spent eighteenyears here growing deader and deader , listening to you skate across the surface . Watching you dodge around what matterslike painting blue sea around boats , with white spaces left for safety 's sake  --  " " What ? " " Ca n't you say something that 7neans something ? " Duncan asked . " About what ? " said his mother . " I do n't care . Anything . Anything but featherstitch and the statute of limitations . Do n't you want to get to the bottom of things ? Talk about whether there 's a God or not . " " But we already know , " said his mother . What was so terrible about that ? None of them could see it . But Duncan stood up , as wild-eyed as any Russian , and said , " I 'm leaving . I 'm going for good . " He slammed out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , but then she stopped in the doorway , undecided . " He 'll be back , " Uncle Two said comfortably . " It 's only growingpains . Ten years from now he 'll talk the same as all the rest of us . " " Go after him , " the grandfather said . " What , Father ? " " Well , do n't just  --  somebody go . You go , Justine . Go after him , hurry . " Justine went . She flew out the front of Great-Grandma 's house and paused , thinking she had already lost him , but then she saw him just coming from Uncle Two 's with a cardboard box . He crossed the lawn and heaved the box into the back seat of the Graham Paige . Then he climbed in himself . " Duncan ! Wait ! " Justine called.  |p85Sur|prisingly  , he waited . She ran up out of breath , clutching her dinner napkin . " Where are you going ? " she asked him . " I 'm moving . " " You are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was like him to leave his clothes behind and take his box of tools and scrap metal . " But Duncan , " she said , " what are we going to do without you ? " " You 'll manage . " " What if we need you for something ? Where will we find you ? " By now other members of the family were straggling onto Great-Grandma 's porch . She could tell by the look he flashed over her shoulder . " Bye , Justine , " he said . " I 've already got a place , beside that bookstore on St. Paul , but do n't tell the others . " " But Duncan  --  " " Bye , Justine . " " Bye , Duncan . " At first the family assumed he would be home in no time . It was only his age . Everybody eighteen expected deep things of people , but it never lasted . Yet the days stretched on and there was no word of him . They began to question Justine more closely . " He 's all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " was what she had said earlier , but now that was n't enough . Had he told her where ? Because this was not some childhood game any more , surely she was mature enough to realize that . Was n't she ? But she had promised Duncan . Aunt Lucy said Justine was cruel and selfish . Justine 's mother said there was no call for that sort of talk , and then Aunt Lucy broke down and cried . " Now look here . Get a hold of yourself , " the grandfather said , which made her turn on him . Why could n't a person let loose a little , after all ? Where was the sin ? How come a forty-four-year-old woman did n't have a right to cry in her own house , and state her feelings as shep86pleased , without a bunch of Pecks crowding around telling her she was not sufficiently dignified , and elegant , and tasteful , and respectable ? " Why , Lucy Hodges ! " said Aunt Sarah . Aunt Lucy gave her a look of pure hatred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Justine was miserable . She would much rather tell and be done with it . But even if the grownup rules were different , Duncan was still playing by the old ones and he would be furiousif she told . She hoped he would come home by himself  --  " turn himself in " was how she thought of it . Or that Uncle Two , strolling the Hopkins campus with false nonchalance duringclass break , would run across Duncan on his own . But Duncandid n't come and he was n't seen on campus , and Uncle Two did n't want to ask at the Dean 's office outright and involve other people in family matters . " You owe it to us to tell , Justine , " he said . His face was tired and gaunt and there were shadows under his eyes . Aunt Lucy was n't speaking . Even the cousins looked at Justine with a new edginess . How had she got herself into this ? All she wanted was for the family to be happy together . That was the only reason she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt like someone who takes a single short step on solid ice and then hears a crack . She was halfway onto a drifting floe , one foot pulling out to sea and the other still on shore . Then her grandfather said , " Have you been to see hiin ? " " Oh , I do n't think he 'd like me to , Grandfather . " " Why not ? You 're his cousin . " " I know . " " Yes , well , " her grandfather said , and he pulled at his nose . " Well , never mind that . Go anyway . It 's the only way we 'll get any peace around here . " " Go visit him ? " " You did n't promise not to do that , did you ? Go ahead . Do n't worry , nobody will follow you . " But Justine half hoped someone would follow . Then life could get back to normal.  |p87She  knew the address because she had often gone with Duncanto the bookshop he mentioned  --  a cluttered place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ books . To the left of the shop was a paper sign , orange on black , saying ROOMS . When she opened the door she found narrow wooden steps , and at the top of the steps a dark hall with a toilet at the end . The doors reminded her of school , all thickly painted with scuff-proof brown and marked off with curly metal numbers . But she should have brought a flashlight to read the nameplatesby . She moved down the hall very slowly , hunching her shoulders against a feeling of unknown things at the back of her neck , peering at the names scrawled on scraps of ruled paper or adhesive tape : Jones , Brown , Linthicum , T. Jones . No Peck . Only a door to her right with nothing at all , no name in the slot . And that , of course , would be Duncan . She knocked . When he opened the door she held onto her hat , like someone who has just pressed a fun-house button with no notion of what to expect . But all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said . " Was there something you wanted ? " " I 'm supposed to see if you 're all right . " " Well , now you 've seen . " " Okay , " she said , and turned to go . " But you might as well come in , I guess . Since you 're here . " His room was small and dingy , with stained wallpaper , a flapping torn shade , a speckled mirror , and a metal bed with a sagging mattress . Over in one corner was his cardboard box . He wore the clothes he had left home in , brown suit pants and a white shirt without a tie . He seemed thinner . " It does n't look as if you 're eating right , " Justine said . " Is that what you came to tell me ? " " No . " She sat down very delicately on the edge of the bed . She lifted both hands to her hat , making sure it was perfectly level . For some reason , Duncan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat down next to her . " Your mother is really taking on , Duncan . She 's crying where everyone can see her . Your father is  --  " " I do n't want to hear about that . " " Oh . Well  --  " " I know what they 're doing . I always know , I can tell , I can see as if I 'm sitting there . They 're talking about someone in the outside world . They 're digging the moat a little deeper . They 're pointing out all the neighbors ' flaws and their slipping dentures and mispronunciations , they 're drawing in tighter to keep the enemy out . Why do you think my mother 's crying ? Because she misses me ? Did she say that ? Think a minute . Did she ? Did any of them ? No . They 're worried I might be with the wrong kind of people . They 're upset to think a Peck is out there in the world someplace . I 've lowered the drawbridge . " " Oh no , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is calculated to keep others at a safe distance . Everything . Look at your hat ! " Justine 's hands went up again , uncertainly . " No , no , it 's fine . It 's a fine hat , " he told her . " But what are you wearing it for ? " " Why , I always  --  " " Yes , but why ? Did you ever take a good look around you ? Only old ladies wear hats any more , outside of church . But every woman in our family , even little girls , they all wear hats even if they 're just off to the side yard for a breath of air . A lady does n't go without a hat , my dear . Only common people . ' Common ! What 's so uncommon about us ? We 're not famous , we 're not society , we have n't been rich since 193o and we are n't known for brains or beauty . But our ladies wear hats , by God ! And we all have perfect manners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interesting than the weather but at least we do it politely ! And we 've all been taught that we disapproveof sports cars , golf , women in slacks , chewing gum , the color chartreuse , emotional displays , ranch houses , bridge , mascara , household pets , religious discussions , plastic , politics , nail polish , transparent gems of any color , jewelry shaped like ani/finals , checkered prints . . . we 're all told from birth on that no Peck has had a cavity in all recorded history or lost a single tooth ; that we 're unfailingly punctual even when we 're supposed to come late ; that we write our bread-and-butter notes no more than an hour after every visit ; that we always say Baltimore ' insteadof Balmer ' ; that even when we 're wearing our ragged old gardening clothes you can peek down our collars and see Brooks Brothers ' on the label , and our boots are English and meant for riding though none of us has ever sat on a horse . " He wound down like Great-Grandma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long hands drooping between his knees . " But Uncle Two is so sad , " said Justine . " He wanders around the Homewood campus all day hoping to  --  " " Justine . Will you please get out ? " She rose immediately , clutching her little suede purse . But in the doorway Duncan said , " Anyhow , thanks for coming . " " Oh , you 're welcome . " " I meant it , Justine . I 'm sorry I . . . really , if you wanted to come back sometime I would n't mind . " " Well , all right , " Justine said . Then of course when she got home everyone was furious with her , because she had n't found out one concrete fact . What was he living on ? Where was he eating ? Was he going to school ? Who were his companions ? " I just know he 's taken up with some  --  trash , he does haven such peculiar taste in friends , " Aunt Lucy said . And all of them wondered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was living on was a pittance paid him by a Hopkinsprofessor . He was double-checking dry facts in a library , and then writing them into the blanks the professor had left in a very long , tedious book on paleobotany . He was eating saltines and peanut butter , washed down with a quart bottle of milk in his room . He had no companions at all , not even Glorietta , with whom he had had a terrible fight several months ago over herp90habit of saying " between you and I. " Eventually he was going to go very far away , perhaps to British Columbia , but at the moment it seemed he just could n't get up the energy . And no , he was not attending school any more . He was not even reading Dostoevsky , whose writing suddenly appeared to have the squirmy , eye-straining texture of plant cells . As a matter of fact , he thought he might be going crazy . He even liked the idea of going crazy . He waited for insanity as if it were some colorful character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning when he woke up his mind was the same efficient piece of machinery it had always been and he felt disappointed . Several times a week , his cousin Justine would come bringingirritating , endearing gifts  --  a ridiculous pair of slippers , his striped bedspread from home , once his old blue toothbrush with Ipana caked in the bristles . Whenever he opened the door to her he felt deeply happy to see her thin , sweet face and her streamered hat , but before she had been there five minutes he wanted to throw her out . She had such a gift for saying the wrong thing . " Can I tell the cousins where you are ? They want to come too . " " No . God . " " Do you need any money ? " " I can take care of myself , Justine . " " Grandfather gave me some to bring to you . " " Tell him I can take care of myself . " " But I ca n't give it back to him , Duncan . He was so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and secret . He pretended he was n't doing anything . " " Change the subject . " " Like in the old days when he gave out horehound drops . " " Justine , I wish you would go now . " She always went . But she always came back , too , and when she stood in his doorway again a few days later he was all the more touched by her stupid , comical persistence . From earliest childhood she had been his favorite cousin  --  maybe because she was a little more removed , a Mayhew , a Philadelphian , not quite so easy to know . But he was surprised that she would brave hisp91dark stairs and his rudeness . Here she had always seemed so docile ! He made a special effort for her , smoothing the spread and offering saltines from his roach-proof tin and suggesting she take her hat off , which of course she would not do . " Justine , I 'm glad you came back , " he said . " Why , thank you . " " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show things , you say things outright , you do n't feel it 's a sin . You were the only one to ask me not to go , the Sunday I left . " " But Grandfather told me to do that , " Justine said . Right away she had managed to get on his nerves again . She always had an answer . She drove him up a wall . He reached the point where he would turn on her the moment she entered , letting loose a flood of arguments that he had been storing up . " You know what they 're like ? " ( There was no need to say whom he meant . ) " You know who they remind me of ? People choosing a number on a radio dial . The way they ignore anything that is n't Peck , like flicking past stations that do n't concern them , just a split second of jazz or ballgames or revivalistministers and they wince and move on , and settle finally on the one acceptable station that plays Mantovani . Nothing uncomfortable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . " " They tolerated you at that Sunday dinner , " Justine said . " Really you were as rude as can be and they tried to see your side of it and act reasonable . Who are you to say they ca n't talk about eggshells ? " Duncan said , " Nothing outside the family matters . Nobody counts if they 're not Pecks . Not even neighbors , not even Sulie . Why , Sulie 's been with us since our parents were children , but does anybody know her last name ? " " Boudrault . " " Hinm ? " " She married old Lafleur Boudrault , the gardener . " " Oh , details , " said Duncan . " He died in nineteen forty . " " Little church-lady Emily Post details and nothing underneath . And you 're just like them , Justine , you always will be.  |p92Who  asked you to come here and clutter up my life ? " But when she was gone , her smell of warm grass hung in the air and the memory of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ran on and on , arguing , reasoning , imposing logic , even in his dreams . He would wake and punch his flattened pillow and toss beneath the spread that carried her smell too , even from its brief stay in her arms . He wished she were there to argue with ; then he wished she were there to apologize to ; then he wished she were there to lay her long cool body nett to his on the sagging mattress and hold him close all through the deep , steamy Baltimore night . Justine was not herself ; everybody noticed it . Even summer vacation did n't seem to relax her any . She was strange and distantwith her family . She began watching her aunts and uncles in a measuring way that made them uncomfortable . " What 's the watter with her ? " her father said once , but his in-laws only smiled blankly ; they did not believe in asking too many questions . It seemed that they accepted Duncan 's absence now . Sometimeswhen Justine came back from visiting him they would forget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " See Duncan , did you ? " and go on about their business . Even Aunt Lucy appeared resigned . But one day in August , a particularly hot Saturday morning , Aunt Lucy appeared on Great-Grandma 's front steps with a small electric fan . Justine was drying her hair outdoors and reading Mademoiselle . " Justine , dear , " said Aunt Lucy . Justine looked up , with her mind still on her magazine . Her aunt wore the expression of a lady heading calm and smiling toward disaster . " Justine , this is for Duncan , " Aunt Lucy said . " What ? Oh , a fan . He could use it . " " Oh , I knew it ! I 'm so glad I  --  well , whenever you go to see him , then . Are you going today ? " " Today I 'm going on a picnic with Neely . Tomorrow I might , though . "  | " Do n't you think you might stop by this morning ? Would n't you be able to work it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course I could , " Justine said , and she took the fan from her aunt 's shaky hands . It was not until she had parked in front of the bookshop that she noticed the little envelope dangling from the fan 's grid . Duncan 's room was blasting with heat and he was so hot he seemed to have been oiled . He wore a grayish undershirt . His trousers were creased and limp . " Oh , it 's you , " was all he said , and then he sat back down on his bed and wiped his face with his balled-up shirt . " Duncan , I brought you a fan from your mother . " " You 've been telling her about my room . " " No , I have n't . She just guessed you would need this . " " What 's that in the envelope ? " " I do n't know . " He broke the string that tied it and pulled out a folded note . First he read it silently and then lie groaned and read it aloud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sending you the fan from my bedroom , now that it is so warm . Everyone is well although I myself have had a recurrence of those headaches . Just a little tension , the doctor says , so I keep my chin up ! Your father has been working very .. . " What about the fan from my room ? " Duncan said . " There is one , you know . " " She gave you her own to show she cares , she did n't know how else to put it , " said Justine . " None of them do . Oh , you can tell who she married into . She 's just like all the rest of them now . Too little said and too much communicated , so that if you fight back they can say , But why ? What did 1 do ? ' and you wo n't have any answer . It allp94takes place in their secret language , they would never say a thing straight out . " " But that 's tact . They do n't want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embarrass themselves , " Duncan told her . She said nothing . " Is n't that right ? " " Probably it is , " she said . " But so is the other . There is n't any right and wrong . I keep looking at them , trying to decide . Well , everything you say is true but then so is everything I say . And what does it matter , after all ? They 're your family . " " You know who you sound like ? Aunt Sarah , Justine . You 're going to grow up an old maid . Or you 'll marry a stick like Neely and have him change his name to Peck . I can see it coming . I can see it in that flat straight face of yours , just watch . " But he had gone too far . Even he must have known that . When Justine turned away from him , fumbling for something in her purse , lie said , " Anyway ! " He jumped up and started pacing the floor . " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . " Oh ... " " Come on ! " " There 's nothing much . " " Nothing ? Nothing in all those four enormous houses ? " " Well , Aunt Bea has had to get glasses , " Justine said . " Ah . " " She 's very shy about them , she wears them on a string tucked inside her blouse . She takes them off between sentences in a newspaper even . " So Aunt Bea has glasses . " " And Mama 's bought a TV . " " A TV . I might have known it would come to that . " " Oh , it 's not so bad , Duncan . It 's very convenient , do n't you think , having a moving talking picture in your home that way ? I wonder how they do it . " " Actually it 's quite simple , " said Duncan . " The principle'sp95been around for decades . Have you got a pencil ? I 'll show you . " " Oh , I would n't understand , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But I 'm not scientific . I do n't see how you know those things . " " Those things are nothing , " he said , " it 's the others I do n't get . The ones you take for granted . Like mirrors , for instance , " and he stopped his pacing to wave at the mirror on the opposite wall . " I lay awake the other night going crazy over that . I spent hours trying to figure out the laws of reflected images . I could n't measure the angles of refraction . Do you understand it ? Look . " She stood up and looked . She saw herself in the speckled glass , nothing surprising . " How come it shows my image and not yours ? " he asked her . " How come yours and not mine ? How come eyes can meet in a mirror when you 're not looking at each other in real life ? Do you understand the principle ? " In the glass their eyes met , equally blue and distant , as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around and set his hands on her shoulders and kissed her on the mouth . He smelled of salt and sunlight . His grip on her was weightless , as if he were holding something back . When she drew away , he let his hands drop to his sides . When she ran out of the room he did n't try to stop her . Justine would n't visit Duncan any more . Her grandfather kept coming around , pressing twenty-dollar bills into her hand , but she did n't know what to tell him and so she took the money in silence . She stuffed it haphazardly into her jewelry box , feeling like a thief even though she never spent it . She quarreled with her mother over a print dress , saying it was old-ladyish , although before she had worn whatever her mother picked out . When school started she studied indifferently and had trouble getting to class on time . Esther had graduated and was teaching nursery school , but now the twins were commuting with Justine and they objected to her late starts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Justine asked them . " Getting to a class on the dot of nine o'clock ? " The twins looked at each other . Certainly they had never meant to imply that it was the point of life , exactly . On a Saturday night in October , Justine was watching televisionwith Neely in her great-grandma 's study . Neely was stroking her neck up and down in a particularly rasping way , but she had been so short-tempered with him lately that she did n't want to protest . Instead she concentrated on the television : a mahogany box with a snowy blue postage stamp in its center , showing a girl who had become engaged due to cleansingher face with cold cream twice a night . She flashed a diamondring at her girlfriends . " . Your diamond 's going to be twice as big , " said Neely . " My father 's already promised me the money . " I do n't like diamonds , " said Justine . " Why not ? " " I do n't like stones that are transparent . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " On the television , a man held up a watch that would keep running steadily through everything , even a cycle in a washing machine . " How about me ? " Neely asked . " What ? " " Do you like 7ne ? " His finger kept annoying her neck . Justine winced and drew away . A man in downtown Baltimore was interviewing people coming out of a movie theater . He wanted to see if they had heard of his product , an antibacterial toothpaste . " Goodness , no , " said a lady . " Well , think a minute . Say you have a cold and get over it . You would n't want to catch it right back again from your toothbrush , would you ? " " Goodness , no . " He stopped a man in a raincoat.  | " Sir ? Have you ever thought how risky it is , using the toothbrush you used when you were sick ? " " Why , no , now I never considered that . But you got a point there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Neely . " Is n't that your cousin ? " Duncan was wearing some dark shade of jacket that Justine had never seen before . His face was clamped against the cold . There was no one in the world with such a pure , unwavering face . He stooped a little to hear the question , concentrating courteously with his eyes focused on something in the distance . When the man was finished Duncan straightened and thought a moment . " Actually , " he said , " once your body 's built up enough resistance to overcome those bacteria in the first place it 's very doubtful if  --  " The man discontinued the conversation and ran after a fat lady . Justine went to the front hall for her coat . " Justine ? " Neely called . She ignored him . Probably he thought she was out of hearing , maybe gone to the kitchen for soft drinks . At any rate , he did n't call again . All she told herself was that she owed Duncan a visit . He was her cousin , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grandfather 's money . ( Which was still crammed in her jewelry box at home . ) She had herself convinced . But Duncan must have known exactly how her mind worked , because when he opened the door he stood looking at her for a minute , and then he drew her in and kissed her , and then he said , " Look , I can see the layers sliding across your eyes like shutters until you can properly explain this away . " Then he laid her on his bed , with its hollow center that rolled her toward him so that she could feel his warm bones through the thin white fabric of his shirt . He took off her clothes and his . Still she did n't make a single objection , she said none of the things that she had said to Neely . She felt happy and certain , as if everything they did was alreadyp98familiar . She seemed to be glinting with some secret laughter at this newer , more joyous mischief that they were just inventing , or at Duncan 's Puckish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his mirror eyes , a naked girl wearing a Breton hat. 6DUNCAN came home in March of 1953  --  He walked into his great-grandma 's dining room one Sunday at dinnertime . " Duncan ! " his mother said , half rising . Then , " What on earth is that you 're wearing ? " He was wearing a peajacket he had bought from Navy surplus . His hair needed cutting . He had been gone nearly a year and in that time his face had changed in some indefinable way that made him an outsider . The grownups stared and his cousins gave him self-conscious , sidelong glances . All but Justine , who raised her face like a beacon and smiled across the room at him . He smiled back . " Well , my boy , " his grandfather said . " So you 're home . " " No , " said Duncan , looking at Justine . But they did n't believe him . " Pull up a chair , " his mother said . " Take mine . Get yourself a plate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I 'm going to get married , " Duncan said . " Married ? " The ghost of Glorietta flashed scarlet through their minds . All the grownups shifted uneasily . " I 'm marrying Justine . " First they thought it was a joke . A tasteless one , but just like him . Then they saw how grave and still the two of themp99were . " My God , " said Justine 's mother . She clutched suddenly at a handful of ruffles on her chest . " My God , who would have thought of such a thing ? " Though it seemed to all of them , now , that they should have thought of it long ago . Those visits Justine had paid him ! Those trips ! Everyone knew she hated traveling as much as any other Peck . Yet day after day this winter she had packed a lunch in Sulie 's kitchen and said she would n't be home till night . " I 'm going on a trip with Duncan . Out to the country somewhere . " " Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Keep an eye on him for us . " She had cut classes , missed important family gatherings , stopped seeing Neely , grown distant from her cousins  --  " But it 's good she 's with Duncan , " they told each other . " She 's sure to be a good influence on him . " How she had deceived them ! Only Sam Mayhew , slow of mind , seemed unable to make the mental leap the Pecks had just accomplished . He looked all around the table , from one person to the other , with his face set to laugh as soon as he saw the joke . " What ? What 's that ? " he said . The others waved him aside , too busy adjusting to the shock . But Duncan came over and stood squarely in front of him and spoke very quietly , as if to a child . " Uncle Sam , I 'm marrying Justine . " " But  --  you ca n't ! " " I 'm telling you I am . I 'm telling you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change my mind . " " You ca n't . " " Why , it must not even be legal ! " said Caroline . " Yes , it is , " Duncan told her . " Oh yes , " his grandfather said . " But  --  " said Caroline . " Who 's the lawyer here , von or me ? Boy 's right . It 's true . And yes , I know , there 's a lot to be said against it . But look at it this way . What nicer girl could he have picked ? She 's sure to settle him down some . And this way there 's no adjustment for t hem to make , no in-law problems  --  " " You ought to be locked up , " Sam Mayhew - said.  | " Sir ! " said Grandfather Peck . " Have n't you heard of inbreeding ? " " Not at the table , Sam . " " Have n't you heard of genes ? " " Now , we come of good solid stock , " the grandfather said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the carving knife . " Care for a slice of ham , Duncan boy ? " " He 's a blood relative , " said Sam Mayhew . " And he 's only twenty years old , and he has n't got a responsible bone in his body . Well , I 'm not going to allow it . Justine wo n't marry Duncanor any other Peck . " " Then we 'll elope , " Duncan said . " Elope ! " cried Justine 's mother . " Oh , anything but that ! " " You are a fool , Caroline , " Sam Mayhew said . Then he stood and took Justine by the wrist and pulled her up and towardthe door . But she was still calm and so was Duncan . Nothingseemed to disturb them . As Justine passed Duncan he gave her a slow , deep stare that caused the rest of the family to avert their eyes . " Come , Justine , " her father said . He led her through the living room and up to her bedroom . She went without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shut her door and locked it , and put the key up on the ledge again before he went back to the others . In her ruffed rocker , Justine sat and waited . The pointlessnessof being locked in her room seemed more comical than annoying , and she was not worried about her family . Had n't Duncan predicted everything ? " Your father 's the one who 'll be upset . The others will get over it . Anyway , it 's always been a bother adapting outside wives . Then your father will give in because he has to . There wo n't be any problems . " " I know there wo n't . " " There would be even less if you would just run away with me . " " I want to do this right , I said . " " Does it matter that much ? Justine , why does it matter ? They 're just a bunch of people , just some yellow-haired , ordinarypeople . Why do you have to ask for their approval ? "  | " Because I love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any answer for that . Love was not a word he used , even to her . She rocked and gazed at the wintry gray sky , while downstairsthe battle went on and on . Great-Grandma soothed everyone , a dry brown thread weaving in and out . She thought this marriage was a wonderful idea ; she had never heard of genes . When Sam Mayhew stormed , Grandfather snapped and cut him short . Uncles rumbled and aunts chirped and burbled . And over it all rode Duncan 's level voice , sensible and confident . Justinecould tell when he began to vein . He continued alone , the others fell behind . The worst of the battle was over . All that was left was for the losers to regain face . Justine felt suddenly stifled and bored . She went into her bathroom for her toothbrush , and took a pack of matches from her bureau drawer . She had not grown up with Duncan for nothing : heating the toothbrush handle very slowly , she pushed it little by little into the lock of her door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she re-entered the dining room , they did n't seem surprised to see her . Only Duncan , noticing the toothbrush in her hand , tipped back in his chair and looked amused , but he sobered up when Justine 's father rose and came around the table to face her . " Justine , " he said . " Yes , Daddy . " " It has been pointed out to me that there 's nothing I can really do to stop you . All I can hope is that you 'll listen to reason . Justine , look . Do n't you see why you 're doing this ? It 's merely proximity , the two of you had no one else , no one in this family has anyone else . You were thrown too much together , at an age when naturally . . . and you were afraid to turn to some outsider . Admit it . Is n't that correct ? " Justine thought it over . " Well , " she said finally , " it does sound correct , yes . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sides sound correct . I always agree with who I 'm listening to . "  |p102He  waited , expecting more . All she did was smile . " Aah ! " he said suddenly , and turned away , throwing up his hands . " You even sound like him . You 're a puppet . I 've learned something today : set a bad and a good person down together and the bad wins every time . I always wondered . " " Say that again ? " said Aunt Lucy . " Is it Duncan you 're calling bad ? " " Who else ? " " Duncan 's not a bad boy . " Even Duncan looked surprised . " Justine 's the one who kept the rest of us away from him . Justine would n't tell his own mother where he was staying ! Blame your daughter ! " " Why , Lucy ! " Justine 's mother said . Duncan let his chair tip forward . This might turn out to be interesting . But no , they were distracted by a new development : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his elbows out and his clock-shaped face set impassively toward some point above their heads . They knew at once that somethingimportant was going on . " I wo n't be attending this wedding , " he said finally . " Oh , Sam ! " his wife cried . " And I wo n't be living here . " " What ? " " I 'm moving out to my parents ' . I 'm going to look for a house in Guilford . " He finished the buttons . He began pulling his shirt cuffs down , neat bands of white above his chubby red hands . " You may come too , of course , Caroline . And Justine if she decides against this marriage . But I warn you : if you come , we will only be visiting your family once a month . " " Once a vionth ? " " The first Sunday of every month , for dinner . We 'll go home at three . " " But Saw  --  " his wife said . " Make your choice , Caroline . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned top103her family . She was still baby-faced , although the years had worked like gravity pulling on her cheeks . Her weight had settled in upon itself . She looked like a cake that had collapsed . To each brother and sister , to her father and her grandmother , she turned a round lost stare while twisting the pearls on her fingers . " What 's your decision , Caroline ? " " I ca n't just leave them like that . " " All right . " " Sam ? " she said . He walked over to Justine . Duncan rose instantly to his feet . " Justine , " Sam Mayhew said , " you have been a disappointingdaughter in every way , all your life . " Then Justine rocked back as if she had been hit , but Duncanalready stood behind her braced to steady her . The wedding was to be held in a church . All the family insisted on that . Duncan had not been to church in several years and detested Reverend Didicott , a fat man who came from Aunt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surely double the length of the ceremony ; but he said he would do whatever Justine wanted . And Justine , half willing anyway , went along with the others , submitting to a long satin dress , Sarah Cantleigh 's ivory veil , and a little old lady consultant with an emergency cigar box full of pins , white thread , spirits of ammonia , and a stick of chalk for stains . " Oh , Duncan ! " Justinesaid , as she sped by him on the way to the photographer . " I 'm sorry ! I know how you must hate this ! " But he was surprisinglytolerant . He had agreed to give up his room and move home for the month preceding the wedding ; he went without a word to buy a black suit that turned him stern and unfamiliar . During lulls in the excitement , he seemed to be observing Justine very closely . Did he think she would change her mind ? Reading Bride 's magazine , she felt his eyes upon her , weighing her , watching for something . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he never would say . Her mother was everywhere . She bustled and darted , givingcommands , trilling out fitting schedules in a voice so gay itp104seemed about to break off and fly . " Really , no one would guess her husband 's left her , " Justine told Duncan . " Do n't speak too soon . " " Why ? " " Now she 's got the wedding to keep her busy . What about later ? " Later Justine would be far away . One thing Duncan would not agree to was living in Roland Park . Nor even in Baltimore , not even long enough for Justine to finish school . And he would not go back to school himself . So they were renting a little house and a plot of land an hour 's drive out in the country , where they used to go on their trips . Duncan planned to start a goat farm . It was what he had always wanted , he said . It was ? Justine had never heard him mention it before . But he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and anyway , he kept losing those jobs , he gave in to a temptation to rewrite their material , making it more colorful , adding his own startling scraps of knowledge and a few untruths . And he and Justine each had a share of old Justin 's trust fund . Because of the proliferation of heirs it amounted to almost nothing , but they could manage till the dairy started paying off . " You 're strapping yourself in , boy , " his grandfather said . " You want an education . And renting 's no good , it 's a shoddy way to do things . " " Sure , Grandfather . " But Duncan went on reading the Dairy Goat Journal , rummaging through his shocks of hair as he always did when he was absorbed in something . And a week before the wedding he helped supervise the loading of a Mayflower van containing ancient , massive furniture from the relatives and rolled-up rugs , crates of crystal stemware , gifts of silver and china , linens monogrammedby Aunt Laura May and heavy damask curtains , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure that everything was suitable , but how else would you furnish a place ? She did n't know . Duncan made no comment , only watched without surprise as she directed the movers toward a claw-footed bureau , a tasseled floor lamp , a bedstead with pineappleknobs.  |p1O5  " Prepare your mother , now , " he told her . " I mean it . Get her ready for doing without you , because it 's going to be a shock for her once it happens . " " I will . " " Prepare yourself , Justine . " " Prepare for what ? " " Do you really understand that you 'll be leaving here ? " " Of course I do , " she said . Well , naturally she would rather not be leaving . It made her sad just to think about it . But nothing mattered as much as the lurch in her stomach when she saw him . When they sat apart in Great-Grandma 's study , some inner selves seemed to rise up and meet while their bodies remained seated . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were sick and dizzy . She missed Duncan 's room downtown : his jingling bed , the warm pulse in the hollow of his throat , the leathery arch of his right foot curving exactly to the shape of her calf when they fell asleep . " Still , " Duncan said , " I wish I could be sure you know what you 're getting into . " At the rehearsal , Esther took the part of the bride for good luck . It was terrible to see her up there so close to Duncan . Her emerald-green sheath showed off her figure , which was better than Justine 's . " Tell me , " Justine said to Duncan later . " Did you ever think of marrying Esther ? " " No . " " But why me ? " she asked . " Why nee , for that matter ? " " I do n't know , " she said . " Why are you marrying me , Justine ? " " Oh , well , Claude is too fat and Richard 's too young . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On Justine 's wedding morning , a pale cool day in April , her mother woke her by pulling open the curtains in her bedroom . " Justine , " she said , " listen . Are you awake ? "  | " Yes . " " I want you to listen a minute . " She was wearing a slithery pink silk dressing gown and already her doll-like face was made up perfectly , her curls preciselyflattened . She carried a torn scrap of paper . She sat on Justine 's bed and held the paper out to her , smiling a coaxing smile like someone offering medicine . " Your daddy 's telephone number , " she said . " My what ? " " Hear what I say , now . I want you to go out in the hall to the phone . I want you to dial this number . It 's your grandmotherMayhew 's . Ask to speak to your daddy . Say , Daddy , today is my wedding day . ' " " Oh , Mama . " " Listen ! Say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day of my life . Wo n't you make it perfect and come give me away ? ' " " But I ca n't talk like that , " Justine said . " Of course you can . And he has that fine suit that 's still in the cleaner 's bag , I know he took it with him . Why , it would n't be any trouble at all ! Justine ? I beg you , Justine . " " Mama  --  " " Please , I 've been counting on it . I know it will work . See , I 've written the number so neatly ? Take it . Take it . " She pressed it into her hands . Justine climbed out of bed , still unwilling . " Go on , Justine . " In the hall , the telephone sat on a piecrust table . The windowabove it was partly open , so that Justine in her flimsy cottonnightgown shivered while she dialed . " Hello , " Sam Mayhew said . She had been expecting her grandmother , a static-voiced old lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father yet . " Hello , " he said . " Daddy ? "  |p107There  was a pause . Then he said , " Hello , Justine . " " Daddy , I  --  today is my wedding day . " " Yes , I saw it in the paper . " She was silent . She was taking in his soft , questioning voice , which reminded her of his baffled attempts at conversation long ago in Philadelphia . For the first time she realized that he had actually left . Everything had broken and altered and would not ever be the same . " Honey , " he said . " You can always change your mind . " " No , Daddy , I do n't want to change my mind . " " I 'm about to buy a house in Guilford . Would n't you like that ? There 's a room for you with blue wallpaper . I know you like blue . You could go away to college , someplace good . Why , you used to be a high-B student ! Those Pecks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's not too late . You know that . You can still call it off . " " Daddy , will you come give me away at the wedding ? " " No . I ca n't lend myself to such a thing . " " I 'd really like you to . " " I 'm sorry . " Her mother tugged at Justine 's nightgown . " Tell about the happiest day of your life ! " she hissed . " Wait  --  " " Who 's that ? " her father asked . " It 's Mama . " " What 's she doing there ? " " She says to tell you  --  " " Did your mother put you up to this ? " " No , I  --  she just  --  " " Oh , " her father said . " I thought it was you that was asking . I wish it had been . " " I am asking . " " Justine , I 'm not going to come to your wedding . Don'tbring it up again . But listen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all day , or maybe all the rest of your life : you 've got t get out ' oTtTere. "  | " Out , Daddy ... " " You think you are getting out , do n't you . You 're going to farm chickens or something . " " Goats . " " But you 're not really leaving at all , and anyway you 'll be back within a year . " " But we 're going to  --  " " I know why you 're marrying Duncan . You think I do n't . But have you ever asked yourself why Duncan is marrying you ? Why is he marrying his first cousin ? " " Because we  --  " " It 's one of two reasons . ither he wants a Peck along to torment , or toean on . Either he 's going to give yoi Nhell or else he s potted tighter to his family than he thinks he is . But whichever , Justine . Whichever . It 's not a business you 'd care to get involved in . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What ? Hold on there , now  --  " But she hung up . Her teeth were chattering . " What happened ? " her mother asked . " What happened , is n't he coming ? " " No . " " Oh ! I see . Well . " " I feel sick . " " That 's wedding jitters , it 's perfectly natural , " her mother said . " Oh , I never should have asked you to call in the first place . It was only for his sake . " Then she led Justine back to her room , and covered her with the quilt handstitched by Great-Grandma , and sat with her a while . The quilt gave off a deep , solid warmth . There was a smell of coffee and cinnamon toast floating up from the kitchen , and a soft hymn of Sulie 's with a wandering tune . Justine 's jaw muscles loosened and she felt herself easing and thawing . " We 're going to do without him just fine , " her mother said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of things . " Later the minister , Reverend Didicott , told the assistant minister that the Peck  --  Mayhew wedding was the darnedest business hep109had ever seen . First of all the way they sat the guests , who were not numerous to begin with : friends clumped in back , and the bride 's and groom 's joint family up front . There was something dreamlike in the fact that almost everyone in the front section had the same fair , rather expressionless face  --  over and over again , exactly the same face , distinguished only a little by age or sex . Then the groom , who seemed unsuitably light of heart , fol lowed him around before the ceremony insisting that Christianitywas a dying religion . ( " It 's the only case I know of where mental sins count too ; it 'll never sell , " he said . " Take it from me , get out while the getting 's good . " Right then Reverend Didicott should have refused to marry them , but he could n't do ' that to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South . ) The bride was given away by her grandfather , an unsmilingman with a mighty snappy way of speaking to people , although so far as was known the bride 's father was in excellent health . The groom refused to kiss the bride in public . But the bride 's mother was the strangest . Perfectly sedate all through the ceremony , if a little trembly of mouth , gay and flirtatious at ' the reception afterwards , she chose to fall apart at the going away . Just as the groom was enclosing the bride in his car ( which was another whole story , a disgraceful greenish objectwith a stunted rear end ) , the mother let out with a scream . " No ! " she screamed . " No ! How can you just leave me all alone ? It 's your fault your father 's gone ! How can you drive off like this without a heart ? " The bride started to get out but the groom laid a hand on her arm and stopped her , and then they took off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its nose . The mother threw herself in the grandfather 's arms and wept out loud . " We people do n't cry , Caroline , " he said . The most ancientMrs . Peck of all put on a genteel smile and started humming , and Reverend Didicott looked inside the envelope the groom had given him and found fifty dollars in Confederate money . Duncan told everyone they would be away on a honeymoon , but they were n't ; he just liked to lie . Instead they went straightp110to the farm . For two weeks they were left to themselves . Duncanworked uninterrupted , settling in eight Toggenburg does and a purebred buck who smelled like a circus , transporting bales of hay and sacks of Purina goat chow , a block of pink salt and a vat of blackstrap molasses he claimed would increase milk production when added to the goats ' drinking water . The weather had turned suddenly warm and he went about in his undershirt , whistling " The Wabash Cannonball , " while inside their little house Justine threw open all the windows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hinder the breeze . She had made the place a replica of Great-Grandma 's house , if you ignored the green paper walls and the yellowed ceilings . Rugs covered the flowered linoleum , and the four-poster bed hid the fungus growing beneath one window . She fought the foreign smells of kerosene and fatback by hanging GreatGrandma'schina pomander ball in the hall . She worked for hours every day constructing meals from Fannie Farmer 's cookbook , the one her aunts all used . In the evenings , the two of them sat side by side on the front porch in cane-seated rockers that used to be their grandfather 's . They looked out across their scrubby , scraggly land , past the slant-roofed shed where the does stood swaybacked . Like an old country couple they rocked and watched the gravel road , where they might see an occasional pick-up truck bound for the Jordans ' farm on the hill or a string of children carrying switches and weedy flowers , dawdling home . Justine thought she would like to stay this way forever : isolated , motionless , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were like people under glass . They rocked in unison side by side , almost touching but not quite , as if thin wires were stretched between them . Then the letters started coming . " I keep busy , I go for a lot of walks , " her mother said . " Not far , of course . Just up and down your great-grandma 's side yard , up and down again . " Aunt Lucy said , " We think of you often . Especially Caroline does , you can tell although you know she would n't mention it for anything . " " Last Sunday , " Great-Grandma said , " we laid two places for you supposing you might be back from yourp111honeymoon and would think to come for dinner , as it would do Caroline a world of good , but it seems you could n't make it . " rJustine felt stabbed in the chest . " Dear Mama , " she wrote , " I miss you very much . I want to come home for a visit . Duncansays we will just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not something you can just walk off and leave . They have to be milked twice a day and watered , and Duncan has to stay pretty close by anyway because he has put an ad in the paper and soon customers will be coming . . . " " Dear Ma , " Duncan said on a postcard . " High ! We 're doing fine . Say hello to everybody . Sincerly , Duncan . " The family 's ink was black , their envelopes cream . Nearly every morning a cream-colored accordion lay waiting in the mailbox at the end of the driveway . Once Duncan got there before Justine and he scooped the letters out of the box and flung them over his head . " Hoo ! " he said , and tipped back his face like a child in a snowstorm while the envelopes tumbled all around him . Justine came running , and bent at the edge of the gravel to gather them up . " Oh , Duncan , I wish you would n't do things like this , " she told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them all ? " " What does it matter ? Each one is just like the next . " It was true . Still she read them closely , often stirring or starting to speak , while Duncan watched her face . Each envelopelet out a little gust of Ivory soap , the smell of home . She could imagine the leafy shadows endlessly rearranging themselvesoutside her bedroom window , and her grandfather 's slow , fond smile when he met her at the start of a day . She missed her grandfather very much . " If you like , " Duncan said , " I 'll take you this Sunday for dinner . Is that what you want ? " " Yes , it is , " she told him . But somehow they did n't go . Duncan became involved in cleaning the barn , or wiring the new electric fence . Or they simply overslept , waking too slowly with their legs tangled togetherand their blue eyes opening simultaneously to stare at each other across the pillow , and then the unmilked goats werep112bleating and there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sunday , " Justine would write . When the new sheaf of envelopes arrived she felt chastened and sorry even before she had opened them . But when she took the letters to Duncan out in the barn he only laughed . Like a teacher with a pointer , he would poke a stalk of timothy at stray sentences here and there  --  reproaches , transparent braverics , phrases with double and triple and quadruple meanings . " Of course we 're sorry you did n't make it but we understand perfectly , as I had already told your aunts that perhaps we should n't expect you . ' Ha ! " he said . Justine 's face , then , would slowly ease , but she reclaimed the letters and stacked them carefully before she went back to the house . Then one day a truck rattled up their driveway and a man climbed out , carrying a telephone on the palm of his hand . " Phone , " he said , as if Justine should lift the receiver to answer it . But he swung on by her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tools clanking around his hips . Duncan met him in the doorway . " We did n't order that , " he said . " Somebody did . " " Not us . " The man pulled a folded sheet of paper from his pocket and shook it open . " Peck and Sons , " he said . " That 's someone else . " " Your name Duncan Peck ? " " Yes . " " This phone is for you , then . Do n't complain . Bill goes to Peck and Sons . Wished I got presents like that . " " If we had wanted a telephone we would have ordered it on our own , " Duncan said . But Justine said , " Oh , Duncan , it 's a gift ! We ca n't hurt their feelings . " Duncan studied her a minute . Then he said , " All right . " Now the phone rang once , twice , three times a day even , and Justine would come running in from the fields or the barn to answer it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm upstairs . I 'm standing in the hall here looking into your room and your shelf ofp113dolls along the wall , the Spanish lady with her real lace mantilla that your grandfather gave you in Philadelphia when you were only four , remember ? She has the sweetest , saddest face . " " Mama , I 'm helping Duncan dehorn a goat . " " Do you remember when Grandfather gave you the Spanishlady ? You insisted on taking her to bed with you , though she was n't a cuddly kind of doll . Your daddy and I carne into your room every night after you were asleep and put her up on the bureau again . Oh , you looked so innocent and peaceful ! We would stand there a while just watching you . Your daddy did n't have to travel so often then and it seemed we had so much more time together . " " Oh , Mama , " Justine would say , " I wish I could be there with you . Do n't take on so , please do n't cry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the upstairs extension . " She 's started staying in bed , Justine , she never gets out of her bathrobe . She has these awful headaches . I called your daddy but I believe that man is possessed . He said he would n't come , she should come stay in his house and of course that is just not possible , he only has a weekly cleaning lady . Of course she Would need more than that , it 's all we can do to see to her wants even with Sulie helping out . We 're running our feet off . " " We bring all her meals on a tray , " Aunt Laura May said . " We 've moved the television up to her bedroom . " " The radio for daytime . Stella Dallas . " Justine said , " We 'll come on Sunday . " " Do my ears deceive me ? " " We 'll be there around noon , " said Justine . " But we ca n't stay the night , you know , the goats are  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ till then . " She went back out to the field . " Duncan , " she said , " I chink we 'd better go for dinner this Sunday . " " You do , do you . " " It 's been six weeks , you know . And they say that Mama is- " " You do n't have to keep harping on it , we 'll go . "  |p114But  in bed that night , when he had just stretched out alongsideher and taken her head in his hands , the phone rang again and he said , " Bull's-eye . " " I 'll get it , " she said . " Oh , your mother and her X-ray vision . She 's worked on this , she 's got it timed . She could n't call when you were just reading Woman 's Day , no  --  " " Let me up , I 'll answer , " said Justine . " No , do n't . We 'll ignore it . " But then he said , " How can we ignore a thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll only be a minute . " " Eleven , " Duncan said . He had laid one arm across her to hold her down but he kept his head raised and his eyes on the black shine of the telephone . " We 'll go out and sleep in the field , " he told her . " The field , Duncan ! " " Where else ? If we answer , she wins . If we lie here and listen she wins . Hear that ? Four-letter rings . Come on , Justine . " " Well , just let me get a blanket . " " Here 's a blanket . " " I 'll need a bathrobe . " " What for ? " " Do you want your pillow ? " " No I do n't want my pillow . " " And insect repellent . " " Oh , for  --  " Then he was off the bed and out of the room . " Duncan ? " she said . " Duncan , have you changed your mind ? " But before she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iron clippers he used for trimming the goats ' hooves . Justine heard a single click . The phone gave a whimper and died . " Oh , Duncan , " Justine said , but she was laughing when she lay back down . All the next morning the telephone sat silent on the bureau with its comical stub of a tail sticking out . In the afternoon , when they were leaving to do some shopping in town , Duncan locked the front door so that no repairman could come whilep115they were gone . " You know the family is going to let them hear about this , " he said . " They 'll be sending undercover men with their little bags of tools . " And sure enough , when they got back there was a card hanging from the doorknob . " What a pity , our telephone representative has been and gone , " he said . Still , Justine only laughed . But in the evening , when they were sitting on the porch , something stopped her rocking . She straightened suddenly and frowned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " I have this funny feeling . " Duncan had been reading a book on how to start a chicken farm , sliding a flashlight down the page because it was already dark . He raised the flashlight now and shone it into her face . " Something terrible is going on at home , " she told him . " Something terrible 's always going on at home . " " I mean it . This is serious . I really mean it . " " What , have you turned psychic ? " " No , but I can tell if there 's going to be a change of some kind . " He rocked and waited . " We have to go there , " she said . The flashlight clicked off . " I 'm sorry , Duncan . I 'll go alone if you 'd rather . But I just feel I  --  " " All right , all right . " While she packed an overnight case , he drove up the hill to ask Junior Jordan to tend the goats . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Justine knew that as well as Duncan . She waited on the porch , clutching her case , shivering a little althoughthe night was warm . When she saw his close-set headlightsbobbing toward her , she ran down the steps and opened the car door . " It 's all set , " Duncan told her . " Climb in . " The car seemed to be drawn down the road by two long yellow cones . Justine was reminded of other trips , before they were married , rushing home to beat a curfew . All through that silent drive she had the feeling that she was some younger ,  |p116smaller  self , anxiously chewing the ribbons of her hat while she wondered if she would be scolded for staying out so late . In Guilford , at eight o'clock that morning , Sam Mayhew 's cleaning lady had found him dead in his kitchen . He was wearing a bathrobe and there was a roll of Tunis on the floor beside him . Apparently he had suffered a heart attack . By ten o'clock old Mr. Mayhew had called the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew nothing about it . Nobody wanted to tell her . Instead they huddled in small groups downstairs in Great-Grandma 's house , whispering bulletins back and forth . " She 's in her bed eating the chocolates Marcus brought her . " " She 's watching a program on flower arranging . " " She 's trying to get Justine on the telephone again . " " Oh , if only we could just never tell her and this would all blow over ! " Then the grandfather arrived from work . He was forcibly retired now but he liked to prowl around his sons ' offices , checking up . " What 's this ? " he said , seeing clusters of women everywhere . When they told him he shook his head sharply , as if getting rid of a fly . " What ? But how old was he ? Not even out of his forties ! And had a heart attack ? What kind of stock did the man come from , for God 's sake ? " Then he went to break the news to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk but trailing off in the middle of sentences . One by one the uncles came to find out where everybody was , and they had to be told too . Richard arrivedwith a girlfriend who was asked politely to leave , as there had been an unfortunate occurrence . Aunt Lucy , who had double-dated with Sam and Caroline when they were young , became a little upset and kept hanging onto her husband 's arm until Laura May suggested that she fetch her afghan squares to get her mind off things . Then down came the grandfather , sober and dignified , checking his flip-top watch . " Well ? " they asked . " How 'd she take it ? " " Took it fine . " " What 'd she say ? "  | " Did n't say anything . " " Shall we go up now ? " " Do what you like , " he said , and then he went off to his own house , taking Esther with him to fix his supper . The others tiptoed up the stairs . Caroline was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they came in she leaned over to lower the volume slightly on the television set . " Caroline , we 're so sorry , " they said , and Caroline said , " Why , thank you . It 's so nice of you to take an interest . " " If there 's anything we could be doing now  --  " " I ca n't think of a thing ! But I do appreciate your asking . " " Would you like to go over to the funeral home ? Of course it 's not as if you had still been together or anything , I 'm not quite sure what is customary in this case but if you feel you " Why , later , perhaps . Not just now . " " It 's probably not customary anyway . " " No . " " Well , if you want us , then  --  " " Oh , certainly ! I 'll let you know first thing . " They tiptoed down again . Although they should be going to their homes for supper , they seemed inclined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were n't quite sure just how they should behave . The last death in the family had been in 1912 , too long ago for most of them to remember . " Yet after all , " Aunt Sarah said finally , " it 's not as if Sam Mayhewwere really  --  " " No . No . " " And after all , he did actually  --  " " Oh , he acted like a man possessed . " " Always trying to turn her against us . " " Making no effort to understand her . " " And Caroline 's so sensitive . It 's the way she is . " " Refusing to give his own daughter away . " " But still , " said Aunt Lucy , who sometimes grew overemotional , " Caroline loved him ! I know she did , she must have ,  |p118you  could tell she was just torn . And now he 's dead . Oh , what will she do now ? " " Lucy , " her husband said . " About time to feed me my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all right . " " We 'll try to call Justine from our house , Grandma . If the phone 's not fixed , I 'll drive out there in the morning . " " Oh , think of Justine . How will she ever forgive herself ? " Upstairs , cowboys sang lonesome songs around a campfire and the wind rolled tumbleweed across the desert with a howlingsound . At nine o'clock that evening , Caroline rose up in her pink silk gown and put on her feathered slippers . Before leaving the room she turned off the television set . She descended the stairs , stately and flowing ; she crossed the front hall and went out the door . She drifted across the lawn and then onto the road , where she proceeded down the center with her arms out and her steps mincing and careful like a tightrope walker . To the first car that came , she appeared as monstrous and unexpected as a wad of pink bubble gum . The driver gasped and swerved at the last moment . The second driver was harder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lady ! " he shouted out the window , and then he slid smoothly past . She had to wait for six cars , all told , before she found one that would run her down . Duncan brought Justine a cup of beef broth and a silver spoon and a linen napkin . He found her sitting in the living room of Great-Grandma 's house , all alone , staring into space . " Oh . Thank you , " she said . She set the cup on the coffee table . " I made it myself . " " Thank you . " " Ma said coffee , but coffee has no food value . " She smoothed her dress . " Broth has protein , " Duncan told her . " You can go with/out protein for months and feel just fine , never notice , but underneath it 's doing you harm that can never be repaired . Proteinis made up of amino acids , the building blocks of the  --  " " Duncan , I ca n't believe you 're saying all this . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He waited for her to try the broth . She did n't . He squatted beside her . " Justine  --  " he said . But no , too late , the aunts had tracked them down again . " Justine ? You must n't sit like this , dear heart  --  " They reminded him of ships . They traveled in fleets . Their wide summer skirts billowed and collapsed as they settled all around him , edging him out . But he did n't give in so easily . " We were just talking , " he told them . " She should be in bed . " " What for ? " " She does n't look at all well . " She did n't . Even her hair seemed changed , hanging lank and lifeless around her face . In just four days she had developed a new deep hollow between her collarbones . She was already losing her country tan . If he could just carry her home , to the sunlit fields and their little house with its ridiculous damask curtains ! But the aunts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be left with us a while , Duncan . She just feels so sorry , you see . She 's acting just like her poor dear mother did . You ca n't take her back to sit all alone in the middle of nowhere . " " Alone ? " " She needs looking after . " " 1 look after her , " Duncan told them . " Yes , but  --  and she could have her old room again , or maybe yours if hers would bring memories . You could go back to your cows or whatever and we would take good  --  Justine , do you like Duncan 's room ? " " Duncan 's ? Yes . " " There , see ? " " Or she could come to us , " Aunt Bea said . " At our house , you see , we have so much excitement , Esther and Richard rush/ing around and the twins so talkative , she 'd just come out of herself in no time . " " Maybe she does n't want to come out of herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have a little company ! All those young people making merry . Justine ? " Justine sat like a stone . The old secret , tucked-in smile she used to flash Duncan seemed gone forever . When he rose she did n't even look his way , and it seemed unlikely that she noticedwhen he left the room . Now as she cruised through the darkening house she was aware of how everything here was attached to everything else . There was no such thing as a simple , meaningless teacup , even . It was always given by someone dear , commemorating some happy occasion , chipped during some moment of shock , the roses worn transparent by Sulie 's scrubbing , a blond stain inside from tea that Sam Mayhew had once drunk , a crack where Caroline , trembling with a headache , had set it down too hard upon the saucer . She went out the front door that was dented by Justin Peck 's invalid 's bed in the fall of 1905 . She passed her grandfather'sfront porch , where Maggie Rose stood in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's front steps , surrounded by ghostly whispers and murmurs of love and scoldings and reproaches and laughter . Upstairs she found Duncanin his room among Erector Set machines he had built when he was twelve , a full-color poster of Princess Pet in the Land of the Ice Cream Star , the Monopoly board in which all seven cousins had played a thirty-eight-hour world series in the spring of 1944 . But Duncan  --  oh , forever in the present !  --  was whistling " The Wabash Cannonball " and fiddling with a rectangle of lead-colored metal . She did n't know how he could whistle . When she came in the room he stopped . " Do you want to lie down ? " he asked her . He began clearing his bed of every/thing on it , a jungle of wires and soldering irons , tubes of flux , glue , and paint . She sat on the edge of the mattress , but she did n't want to stretch out . It was barely eight o'clock . If she slept now she would lie awake for hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night before . " Anything you wanted to say ? " Duncan asked . " No . " " I thought you might have come to tell me something . " " No . " " Well . " He went back to whatever he was doing , but he did n't whistle any more . " This is a wire-bending jig , " he told her . She did n't comment . " These pegs can be moved , see ? Then you bend the wire around them any way you want . There are all kinds of curves and angles . I could make you a bracelet . Want a bracelet ? Or a necklace , if you like . " She laid her fingers across her eyes , cooling them . " I 've got it , " he said . " A nose ring . Want a nose ring ? " When she opened her eyes she found a curve of wire nearly touching her nose , giving off a gray smell , sharp at one end . She batted it away . " What are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He looked surprised . " Are you trying to get me angry on purpose ? " she asked him . " Well , not on purpose , no  --  " " Why are you acting this way ? " " Justine , I'ni not acting any way . " " How can you play around with little pieces of wire when both my parents are dead , and you 're the one that took me far off and cut the telephone cord and laughed at Mama 's letters and would n't bring me to visit ? " " Justine . " " Daddy warned me , " she said . " He told me straight out you were marrying me to torment me . " " Oh , did he ? "  | " Either that , he said , or to lean on me , but I do n't picture that ever happening . " " Well , he certainly thought of everything , did n't he , " Duncan said . He went back to bending his wire . He adjusted a peg on the jig and turned a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said finally . " That 's all right . " " I just feel so  --  " " It 's all right . " " Duncan , could n't we just stay here a while ? " He looked up at her . " We could live in Great-Grandma 's house , " she said . " Would n't that be nice ? " " No , it would n't . " " Please ? " " I should have known , " he told her . " I did n't really believe you would come away with me in the first place . " " But I feel I 'm getting pulled . I hate to just go away and leave them . And I ca n't stay here without you , but you would n't say a word against it when they brought it up . " " I do n't want to pull you , Justine . " " But then they 're the only ones doing it , and they 'll win . " " Is that the only way you go anywhere ? Being pulled ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Duncan . " I 'd like you to come with me . It 's important . It 's more important than they are . " But she went on watching his face . " Well , how am I supposed to do this ? " he asked her . " I was too well trained , I do n't feel comfortable saying things straight out . They got to me a little too , you know . " " Oh , Duncan , " Justine said . " You 've said everythingstraight out since you were four years old and told Aunt Bea she had hair like broccoli . " " No , " said Duncan . " I a Peck . I not talk so good but I give swell presents . " Then he handed her his wire , a stick figure wearing Jus/tine 's flat hat and triangular dress , looking so straight-backed and light-hearted that even a tribesman in darkest Africa could tell that someone cared for her . The family lined up to see them off , their faces papery in the morning sun . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like this , " Aunt Lucy said . Justine kissed her . She kissed Aunt Sarah , who said , " Do you think your parents would have understood ? Rushingoff as if all that mattered was a pack of billy goats ? " Justine kissed her way down the entire row , not skipping even Richard , who ducked and blushed , and when she came to her grandfather she hung onto him hard for a moment as if this , not the wedding , were her real leavetaking . " Oh , um , now , Justine ' " her grandmothersaid . " Goodbye , Grandfather . " Duncan opened the car door and she climbed in . The seat covers had a fish-oil smell from the sunlight , and when she caned out the window to wave the metal was pleasantly hot on her arm . In the trees above them , mockingbirds were singing . Even when the car roared up they did n't hush . " Scientists , " said Duncan , " have been investigating the stimuli that cause birds to vocalize in the morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sing because they 're happy . " DUNCAN bought a dozen copper-colored hens and installed them in a shed he had built himself , complete with a box of oyster shells to assist in egg production and a zinc watering trough in which they all immediately drowned . But the goats flourished ,  |p124and  since only two customers had answered the newspaper ad there were quarts of surplus milk every day . Justine made butterand hand-cranked ice cream . Duncan boiled up kettles of Norwegian cheese . But no sooner had they finished one batch of milk than the goats gave more , and Justine dreamed at night of a white tide rising all around them . " Maybe we should cut down on the blackstrap molasses , " she told Duncan . " Well , I do n't know if that would do much good . We seem to have started something we ca n't stop , here . " In the mornings Justine walked the gravel road with a basket of cheeses , peddling them to the neighbors , who bought them because they hadrown to like her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hat and her plain cotton dress that was becoming a little faded , Mrs. Jordan would lumberout on her front steps and beam . " Why , it 's Justine Peck ! How are you , honey ? " Justine smiled trustingly , holding out her basket . It was hard for her to ask people to buy things , but she did enjoy the visits . At each house she stopped for a few minutes to sit in the kitchen and talk , and gradually the smells of kerosene and fatback stopped seeming strange to her and she began to feel comfortable with the stooped , prematurely aged women who offered her buttermilk and ginger'cake to put some meat on her bones . Sometimes , though , alone at home , she felt a Est of sorrow blow through her like a wind and she would stop whatever she was doing , hands stilled , face stunned , and gaze into space for several minutes . Once when she was trimming the weeds that drained the fence 's current the smell of cut grass swung her back over years and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nestled between her parents , listening to the murmurof her family all around her . She dropped the clippers and reached for the nearest object ; she gripped the fence until her knuckles turned shiny . The throb of electricity caused a distant , dull ache . Duncan had to pry her fingers loose and say her name several times before she would look up . They-had not been back to Baltimore after that first visit , but she did write home weekly and one or another of the auntsp125would answer . Occasionally her grandfather composed a solemn , formal , nineteenth-century note saying that everyone was well and sent best regards . If only she could reach out and touch his knobby hand , as if by accident ! But all she said in her own lettersback was that Duncan was fine , the weather was fine , the goats were doing nicely . If the sorrow went on too long she drove to Buskville , where she walked the streets for hours . She had been raised to believe that the best cure for grief was shaping , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that much money and anyway , she discovered she was incapable of purchasing clothes for herself . Putting on a dress that her mother had not picked out was a betraza ) .. She was reduced to buying little domestic articles in the " diiiiestore : teaballs , lemon reamers , parsley choppers . It seemed very important to have everything that would make her house perfect . One day in August , having exhausted all the dimestore 's possibilities , she walked down a side street and discovered a hand-lettered cardboard sign reading MAGIC MARCIA . LOVE PROBLEMS . ADVICE . She swooped back through time and found herself on Madame Olita 's doorstep , Duncan watching her teasinglywith one arm hooked around Glorietta de Merino . After a moment she switched her Woolworth 's bag to the other hand and rang Magic Marcia 's bell . The woman who answered was thin and dark , with a crimsonslash of lipstick . She was not much older than Justine , but i here were two little boys with runny noses hanging onto her skirt . Gray straps slid out from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it was too late to back out . Then when she was settled at the kitchen table , over the remains of breakfast , it seemed she was expected to ask some specific question . She had n't known that . " What is it ? " the woman asked , flattening Justine 's hand like a letter . " Husband ? Boyfriend ? " " No , I  --  just general things , I wanted to know . " The woman sighed . She scratched her head and frowned at Justine 's palm . Apparently she saw nothing unusual . " Well , "  |p126she  said finally , " you 're going to live a long time , that 's for sure . " " Yes , " Justine said , bored . Really she had no particular interestin her future , which seemed certain to be happy and uneventfulfrom here on out . " Good marriage . Probably travel a little . Health is good . Probably have a lot of kids . " " I will ? " Justine asked . Duncan did n't seem to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh yes . " A question began to tug at the edges of Justine 's mind . She stared into space , not listening to the rest of her fortune . " Um , Magic Marcia , " she said finally . " Could you tell me something ? If your palm predicts a certain future , is there any way you can change it ? " " Huh ? " " If your future is having children , could you deliberately not have children ? If your future is to cause someone pain , for instance , is n't there some way you could be very careful and not cause pain ? Ca n't you escape your fortune ? " " What is written is written , " said Magic Marcia , yawning . " Oh , " Justine said . On Friday she went to Blainestown , having checked the yellow pages beforehand . She climbed the stairs to SERENA , MISSTRESS OF THE OCCULT . This time , she knew exactly what she wanted to ask . " Could I have avoided my future if my future was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avoid the future , " Serena said . On Monday she went back to Blainestown , this time toMADAME AZUKI , ALL QUESTIONS ANSWERED . " It 's in the stars . There is no escape , " said Madame Azuki . " I see . " On Wednesday she went to Baltimore . Duncan was inventingan automatic bean stringer and he only nodded when she told him she would be out for a while . She drove directly to a cluttered section on the east side of town . She found the dryp127cleaner 's , which was exactly the same even to its fly-specked , faded posters showing women in 1940 's suits . But Madame Olita 's sign on the window above had become a few flecks of paint , and there was a padlock on her door . Justine went into the cleaner 's . A large gray man was lining up laundry tags on the counter . " Can you tell me anything about Madame Olita ? " she asked him . " Ah , Madame Olita . She 's gone . " " What , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not feeling so well , you know ? But was she a fortune teller ! I do n't mind telling you , I used to go to her myself . Okay , so it 's mumbo-jumbo . You know why I went ? Say you got a problem , some decision to make . You ask your minister . You ask your psychiatrist , psychologist , marriage counselor , lawyer  --  they all say , Well of course I ca n't decide for you and we want to look at all the angles here and I would n't want to be responsible for  --  ' They hedge their bets , you see . But not Madame Olita . Not any good fortune teller . Do X , ' they say . Forget Y. ' Stop seeing Z. ' It 's wonderful , they take full responsibility . What more could we ask ? " " Well , do you know where she is now ? Could I just visit her ? " " Sure , she 's right down the block . But I do n't know how much she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , Joe sent you . Maybe she could use the company . Five eight three , apartment A. " " Thank you very much , " Justine told him . " Hope you get the answer you want . " She let the door tinkle shut and walked on down the street , passing more cleaners and cut-rate pharmacies and pawnshops . At the end of the block was a large Victorian frame house surrounded by a veranda , and on the veranda sat Madame Olita in a Polynesian wicker chair . Although it was hot , she wore a crocheted shawl . She still had her stubby haircut , but she had lost an enormous amount of weight . Her clothes flopped and her neck was so scrawny that her face appeared to be lunging forward , vulture-like . She looked hollowed out . While Justinep128climbed the steps she watched without interest , perhaps assumingthis was somebody else 's visitor . " Hello , Madame Olita , " Justine said . " Hmmm ? " Madame Olita pulled herself together , wrapping the shawl more tightly around her shoulders . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh ? Joe . " " There 's a question I wanted to ask . Would you mind ? " " Well , I 'm feeling poorly these days , you see . I do n't look into the future much . " " No , it was n't about the future . " Madame Olita sighed . " Sit down , " she said , pointing to the wicker chair beside her . She reached for Justine 's hand , as if she had n't understood . " But I did n't want  --  " Madame Olita bent Justine 's palm back and frowned . " Oh , it 's you , " she said . Justine felt pleased and shy , as if her unusual lines were her own accomplishment . " Yes , I see , " said Madame Olita , nodding and tapping her teeth with one finger . " You said my marriage was going to disrupt everything , " Justine reminded her . " Did I. " " You said I would break my parents ' hearts . How did you know that ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , leaning back suddenly and dropping her hand . " Really , I do n't remember . You were young and arrogant , and uncomfortable in my rooms , perhaps I just  --  " " But it all came true ! " " Sometimes it does . " " Was that just luck ? " " It may have been . Sometimes it is , sometimes it is n't . Are you asking if I can truly see the future ? I can . But more and more it seems to me that people are resisting change , digging inp129their heels against it . Which does make their futures easy to predict , but why bother ? Fortune telling is only good when you forecast a happening . It falls flat when you say , Never fear , your life will continue in its present course forever . . " She closed her eyes and then opened them and looked puzzled . " But I tend to go on and on , " she said . " You had some question you wanted to ask . " Justine sat up straight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said , " if my fortune was to break my parents ' hearts , is it true then that I had no way of avoiding it ? " " Oh , no . " " No ? " " Goodness , no . You can change your future . I have seen lines alter in a hand overnight . I have seen cards fall suddenly into places where they refused to appear at any earlier reading . " " I see , " said Justine , and then she sank back . It was the first answer that sounded right to her , but now she could n't think why she had wanted to hear it . She felt limp and drained . " Otherwise , " said Madame Olita , " why take any action at all ? No , you can always choose to some extent . You can change your future a great deal . Also your past . " " My past ? " " Not what 's happened , no , " Madame Olita said gently , " but what hold it has on you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so interested , I will teach you the art yourself if you like . " " The  --  oh , well , I  --  " " Cards would be your skill , I think . " " Thank you anyway , " Justine said . " Never mind . You 'll be back . I sit here every day of the week , taking the air . You can always find me . Shut the front gate going out , if you will . " On Monday , Justine told Duncan that she was thinking of becoming a fortune teller . " Oh , really ? " he said . " Are n't you going to laugh ? "  | " Not yet , " he said . " First I have to see how good you are . " So she drove off to Baltimore again , to the white frame house where Madame Olita nodded dimly in her Polynesian chair . " These are ordinary playing cards , " said Madame Olita , but to Justine they looked anything but . They were very old and the back of each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artists , dancing dogs , and bareback riders . " They once belonged to my mother . Who , though you would n't believe it to look at me , was a genuine gypsy lady with seven ruffled petticoatsand tiny brass cymbals that attached to her fingers for keeping time while she danced . She was raised in an abandoned candy store on Gay Street . Not exactly a painted wagon , but still . . . unfortunately she married my father , a high school civics teacher . She left her old life entirely , she cut off her long black hair , she had two daughters whom she sent to Radcliffe . However , I would rather have been raised a gypsy . " She cut the cards . Justine sat across from her with her mouth open . " It was my plan , after I graduated from Radcliffe , to join a caravan and marry a man with one gold earring . But it did n't work out that way . I looked then more or less as I do today . I never married anyone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a job in my father 's high school , teaching algebra , but meanwhile I had learned fortune telling from my mother . Dancing I never mastered . I tried , though . My sister was quite good at it . But I bettered her at fortune telling . How I coveted these cards ! My mother refused to give them to me . Cards like these are passed on only when the owner is dying , you see , and has no further use for them . Naturally I did n't want my mother to die . But shall I tell you ? When she failed to wake from surgery at the age of fifty-seven , the first thing I thought was , Now I can have the cards . ' I went home and got them out of her wooden chest , then I walked over to the school and resigned my position . I set up shop in east Baltimore , above the cleaner 's . I have never laid eyes upon a caravan . "  |p131She  laid the cards out in concentric circles on a wicker table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got the cymbals . " Then she frowned and stabbed a card with her forefinger . But pay attention ! These cards are not read like books , you know . They have meanings assigned that you can memorize in half an hour , but ambiguous meanings . The death card , for instance . So called . But whose death ? The client 's , or someone 's close to him ? And when ? Is it real or metaphorical ? No , you must think of these cards as tags . " " Tags , " Justine said blankly . " Tags with strings attached , like those surprise boxes at parties . The strings lead into your mind . These cards will pull out what you already know , but have failed to admit or recognize . Which is why palmistry works as well , or tea leaves or the Tarot or crystal balls , although I myself have yet to see a thing in a crystal ball . They all have validity , yes , but only when coupled with your own intuitions . You could take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have n't the scholarly mind for it . " " I prefer cards , " said Justine . " Yes , yes , I know . But pay attention to everything . Watch your clients carefully . There will only be two kinds . Most are bored and merely hope to be told that something will happen . A very few lead eventful lives but can not make decisions , which may be why they lead eventful lives ; they will ask you to de-cide . " " Which am I ? " said Justine . " Hmm ? I do n't know . Maybe neither . You have never asked me to read your fortune , after all . " " Oh . I guess not , " Justine said . " You 're still looking backward , anyway , " Madame Olita told her . " No , I 'm not ! " " Suit yourself . " After her lessons Justine drove straight home , but threads , strings , ropes pulled her in the direction of Roland Park and al-t hough she never gave in she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you could go over for lunch , " Duncansaid , but she thought from the way he spoke that he dreaded her agreeing to it . And she knew that her family would be distressedif they heard about Madame Olita . Then her new accomplishment , which was still as thin and fragile as a freshly hatched egg , would never seem right to her again ; that was the way her mind worked . She did n't go . Did she believe in fortune telling herself ? At Madame Olita 's she did . She was drawn in , impressed and fascinated by those no-nonsense hands dealing out the future . But then at home she felt compelled to test her faith with Duncan . She laid out her Bicycle playing cards self-consciously in front of him . " Today , " she told him , " I learned the formation used by MademoiselleLe Normand , back in Napoleon 's time . " " Le Normand , " he said , interested , cataloguing the name in his mind . " We practiced on Madame Olita 's landlady , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get married . " He grinned . " But ! " said Justine . " She is ! She told me afterward . " " Good for you . Good for her . " " Madame Olita says just a little longer and I can set up in business . " " We 'll retire and live on your earnings , " he said . She was relieved that he did n't laugh . This was the only special skill she had ever possessed , the only thing she knew that he did not . Once he started memorizing her list of significations , but he got sidetracked while shuffling the cards and worked out a proof for Bernoulli 's Law of Averages instead . There were days when Madame Olita was sharp-tempered and nothing would satisfy her . " Really , Justine , I despair of you ! " she said . " Your mind ! You have every qualification to be a good fortune teller but you will never be great , you 're mentallylazy . You coast along in intuition . " " You said intuition was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was everything . You have to knowp133a few facts as well , after all . These cards are like a doctor 's instruments . A good doctor has intuition too but he would never throw his instruments away on the strength of it . " " But you said they were just tags , you said  --  " " Enough ! " And Madame Olita would fling up her hands and then slump in her chair . " You 'll spend your life doing readingsfor housewives and lovesick schoolgirls , " she said . " I do n't know why I bother . " But other days she was as mild as milk . Then she would tell stories about her clients . " Will I ever forget that first year ? All the Negroes came for clues on how to play the numbers . Madame Olita I dreamed of handcuffs last night , which is number five nine eight in my Eye of Egypt Dream Book , but also razors , there was a cutting , eight seven three . So which do 1 play ? ' My dear , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' and after a while they gave up on me and never came back . But how I tried ! I wanted to have some influence , you see , on their lives . I would give them demonstrations of my psychic ability . I would have them choose a card and sight unseen I would tell them what it was . " " I ca n't do that , " Justine said sadly . Duncan had tested her once after reading an article on J. B. Rhine . " No , I doubt very much that you would be psychic . " " Then how come I can tell the future ? " " People who have led very still lives can often sense change before others can , " Madame Olita said . " My life is n't still , " said Justine . Madame Olita only sighed . At the last lesson , she gave Justine a test . " It 's time for you to read lily fortune , " she said . Justine had been wanting to do that . She settled down happily at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ street . It was one of her irritable days . " Cut the cards , " Justine told her , and she said , " Yes , yes , I know , " and cut them without looking . Justine chose a very complicated formation . She wanted to do this thoroughly , not missing a thing . She laid each card out with precision , and thenp134sat back and drummed her fingers on her chair arm . After a moment she moved one card a half inch to the left and resettled herself . She frowned . She stopped drumming her fingers . Madame Olita looked over at her with cool interest . Still Justine did n't speak . " Never mind , " said Madame Olita . " You passed . " Then she became full of bustle , issuing last-minute instructions . " Did I tell you that strangers should pay ahead of time ? If they do n't like their fortunes they tend to walk out , they 'll walk right out on you . " Justine only gathered the cards in silence , one by one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ places have license fees , sometimes hundreds of dollars . It is n't worth it . Are you listening ? " " What ? " " Do n't go to Calvert County . Do n't go to Cecil County , do n't go to Charles . " " But we live on a farm , I 'M not going anywhere . " " Ha . " Justine wrapped the cards and set them on the table . She came to stand in front of Madame Olita . " Be a little mysterious , I did n't tell you that , " said Madame Olita . " They 'll have more faith . Do n't let on where you come from or how you learned what you know . Make a point of ignoringpersonal questions when you 're giving a reading . Will you remember all this ? What else should you know ? " Then she gave up . " Well , goodbye , Justine , " she said . " Goodbye , " said Justine . " Could I come back for a visit ? " " Oh . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hospital for a while , I think . But I wish you luck . " " Thank you , " said Justine . She turned to go . " Oh , and by the way . " Justine turned back . Madame Olita , sagging in her chair , waved one hand toward the cards . " You might as well take those along with you , " she said . When fall came Justine worked up the courage to offer her ser/vices at the high school homecoming fair . She donated her fees to the school . After that people began traveling all the way out to the farm , several a week , mostly women , asking if they should get married , or divorced , or sell their land or have a baby or move to California . Justine was astonished . " Duncan , " she said , " I do n't want to be responsible for people . For telling them who to marry and all . " " But I sort of thought you believed in this , " Duncan said . She wound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , never mind , " he told her . " Just do n't say anything that would cause somebody harm . But I do n't think people take had advice . They 've got intuition too , you know . In fact I 'd be surprised if they take any advice at all . " So she continued receiving people in her small , warm kitchen , laying Madame Olita 's cards across the surface of Great-Grandma 's rosewood table . She became a gatherer of secrets , a keeper of wishes and dreams and plans . Sometimes when people very young or very old came in , full of vague hopes , unable or unwilling to say what they would like to ask , she merely reassured them . But sometimes she was so explicit that her own daring amazed her . " Do n't sell any family possessions , particularly jewelry , particularly your mother 's , " she would say . " How did you know ? " She had n't known she did know . Then sometimes people came whose flat , frictionless lives offered Justine no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advice came to mind . " Do n't rely too heavily on a man who bites his fingernails . " In the next room , Duncan snorted . Justine charged three dollars for each reading . They needed it ; their milk customers barely paid for the newspaper ad . Jugglingthe budget to meet the rent , scraping up money from half a dozen sources , Justine had the feeling that she had been through all this years and years ago . Then she remembered : Monopoly . When Duncan had wiped her out and she was sellingback hotels and mortgaging her railroads and turning in **27;3410;TOOLONG card , all to pay the rent on Boardwalk . Their present problems did not seem much more serious than that . She knew that Duncan would manage . For Christmas they went home to Baltimore . The family was very cautious and tactful , circling widely around all delicate subjects . It broke Justine 's heart to see what an effort they made . She worried about Duncan  --  would he say something new to hurt them ? She went to bed each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed around the gifts that Justine had made by hand and he even invited the family to come and visit some Sunday . ( " Oh , well , but it 's so much more comfortablefor you to come here , do n't you think ? " everybody said . ) On the fourth day , when he became very quiet , Justine was quick to agree that they should head back early . She felt sad saying goodbye , particularly to her grandfather , but each time now it seemed a little easier than before . In February , when money was especially tight , Duncan got a part-time job in town reporting for the Buskville Bugle . " But you ca n't spell ! " said Justine . " Never mind , you can . " For three weeks he ricocheted around the countryside , attendingcornerstone layings , turtle derbies , zoning meetings , a Future Farmers contest in parliamentary procedure , a lecture on crop rotation . He enjoyed everything he went to , indiscriminately , and came home full of new scraps of information . " Did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stick in the ground ? If you harvest crimson clover too late it will turn into balls in your horses ' stomachs . I 've learned a quilting pattern from the eighteenth century . " But then writing the articles made him irritable . He never did like going at something systematically . He would hand Justine great sheaves of yellow paper all scrawled over and crossed out , with doodles in the margins . When she ran through them with a red pencil , correcting his spelling and slashing through his long digressions , he lost his temper . " Occurrence , o-c-u-r-e-n-c-e , " he said . " Why wreck it up adding extra c 's and is ? "  | " Because that 's how it 's spelled . " " A waste of letters . This language has no logic to it . " " I ca n't help that . " " Why 'd you cross out my butterfly paragraph ? " " In an article on potato blight ? " " There happened to be a particularly fine great spangled fritillary sitting on the farm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by everybody , all the way through the lecture . You ca n't expect me to overlook a thing like that . " And he would type the article complete and hand it in to the office , where any reference to butterflies was immediately deleted . " They have minds like a snake 's intestinal tract , " Duncan said . The fourth week , he attended an amateur musicians ' contest . His article that night began very well , describing the contest'shistory , its sponsors , and the instruments represented . The next paragraph switched suddenly to first person and related his own impromptu entry with a borrowed harmonica , playing " Chattanooga Choo Choo " for which he won fourth prize . In the third paragraph he reflected on the oddity of the word " impromptu , " which could easily be mistaken , he said , for the name of some obscure Rumanian composer . The newspaper editor said that , actually , they did n't need a new reporter as much as they had thought they would . By March , Duncan was becoming restless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well , six does had been dried off in preparation for their kidding in the spring . But Duncan rattled around the house like a bean in a box , staring out one window after another , starting inventions he did n't finish , sendingoff to the Department of Agriculture for pamphlets on all sorts of impulsive projects : angora rabbits , fruit trees , popcorn . He painted half the kitchen yellow and then quit . He brought home a carload of rhododendron bushes with their roots balled up in burlap and he planted them all around the yard . " But Duncan , " Justine said , " do you think this is the proper time ? " Theyp138were still wearing overcoats to bed ; the ground was still cold and gray . " Why do I have to do everything properly ? " he asked . " Do n't worry , I 've got a green thumb . A green hand . I 'm a whole green man . " And sure enough , the rhododendron took heart and started growing . But Duncan went off and forgot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the least . " To tell the truth , Justine , " he said , " this winter business is wearing thin . I imagined we 'd be sitting by the stove oiling harness leather or something , but we do n't have any harness leather . Do n't you feel tired of it all ? " " No , " Justine said . She watched , frowning , while he measured the kitchen for some shelves . She did n't think he would ever finish them . In April eight kids were born , all does . " Did you ever see such luck ? We 've got a whole damn herd , " Duncan said . Justine was glad because the bucks would have had to be killed . She spent hours playing with the kids , running across the field so that they would frolic behind her . They kicked up their heels and turned awkward half cartwheels . She set her face next to their muscular little muzzles ; their yellow , slashed-looking eyes looked softly back at her . After the first few days they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a pan , while Justine crouched beside them and stroked their tufted spines . She fed them handfuls of grass to accustom them to solid food , and for most of the day she kept them in her yard . Meanwhile Duncan carried in endless buckets of warm milk , which he filtered and ran through the great silvery separator . There was suddenly a stream of customers with indigestion , allergies , or colicky babies , all desperate for goat milk , and the grocery store in Buskville had shown an interest in carrying Duncan 's cheeses . " There , " said Justine . " I knew it would work out ! " " Well , yes , " Duncan said . In May , all the kids died in one night from eating rhododendronleaves . Justine wandered around forlornly for days , mourning as if the kids had been human . But all Duncan would say was , " Isn'tp139it peculiar ? You would think if rhododendron was poisonous they 'd know it . " " All those lovely little brown soft furry babies , " Justine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Are intelligence and instinct inversely related ? " " At least we have the nannies still , " Justine said . " We do n't have to start completely over . " " No . " " And there 'll always be a new batch next year , and I wo n't let them in the yard at all . " Duncan picked up her hand . " Justine , " he said , " whatwould you think of getting out of the goat business ? " " What ? Oh , Duncan , you ca n't quit now . Not after onelittle setback ! " " No , that 's not the reason . I 've been considering this for some time . I mean , there 's no challenge to it any more . Besides , it keeps you tied down , you always have to be around at milkingtime . It makes me feel stuck , I feel so  --  and I was thinking . You know what I enjoyed most this year ? Building that hen house . Putting things together , fixing them up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down in Virginia , making unfinishedfurniture and so on . If he could take me in  --  " " Virginia ? But that 's so far . And I never knew you wanted to make cabinets . " " Well , I do . " " We 're so nice and settled ! " " But I do n't like being settled . " " And we would never get back to Baltimore . Duncan , I 've already gone far enough , I do n't want to go farther . I could n't stand going farther . " He waited a moment , looking down at her . Then he said , " All right . " They did n't talk about it again . People came filing through Justine 's kitchen for advice on their spring problems : love affairs , unexplainable bouts of wist/fulness , sudden waves of grief over people and places they had not even thought they liked . Justine laid her cards on the rosewoodtable . " It will work out . " " Just wait through this . " " You will feel better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buckets full of milk . He had grown very silent , although if she spoke to him he always answered . He began drinking bourbon at night after supper . He drank from his great-grandfather 's crystal stemware . After the second glass his face became radiant and serene and childlike , and he would switch on a lamp in slow motion and start reading paperbacks . The technical books that he usually liked grew a film of dust while he worked his way through a stack of moldy , tattered Westerns the previous tenants had left in the barn . Whenever Justine looked over his shoulder stubbledmen were drawling threats and cowboys were reaching for their guns . " Duncan , " Justine said , " would n't you like to sit out on the porch with me ? " " Oh , no thank you . Later , maybe . " But later he went to bed , moving dreamily through the house , not asking if she were coming too . She sat alone at the kitchen table and shuffled her cards . Then she laid them in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ client . She yawned and looked to see what had shaped up . She saw journeys , upheavals , surprises , new people , luck , crowds , hasty decisions , and unexpected arrivals . Which meant , of course , that Madame Olita was right : it was not possible to tell your own fortune . All the same , if she had had a client with these cards ! She imagined how she would glance at him , interested for the first time , amazed at his quicksilver life after all the stale ones she had seen up till now . She imagined possessing such a future herself , having to consult the cards every day , so much was going on . Then it seemed to her that she was not reading her fortunep141after all , but accepting little square papers that told her what was expected of her next . She had no choice but to stand up , and gather her cards , and wrap them in their piece of silk before she went to the bedroom to wake Duncan . This time they moved in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They left behind Justine 's beloved goats , Duncan 's chewed-looking rhododendron bushes and his empty , echoing , beautifully built hen house . They took most of the Peck furnitureas well as ten years ' supply of Bag Balm , which turned out to be excellent for chapped hands . And all the way to Virginia , his truck following behind the apple-green Graham Paige , Duncanstudied the back of Justine 's head and wondered what was going on in her mind . He knew she hated this move . She had joined up with him , he thought , as easily as taking the hand of someone next to her on a sofa . How could she guess that immediatelyafterward she would be pulled not only off the sofa but also out of the house , out of the city , off to another state , even , clinging fast in bewilderment and asking herself what had happened ? And now look : she was so bright and reckless , rattlingdown the highway , he was reminded of her mother 's terriblegaiety at the wedding reception . He knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yet in Virginia , in their shallow hot apartment above Uncled Hodges 's garage , Justine remained cheerful . She hummed as she settled their belongings in  --  only , perhaps , taking a little less care this time , leaving the damask curtains unhung and giving Aunt Marybelle , without a thought , the huge walnut breakfrontwhen it would n't fit through the apartment door . She located a church bazaar , where she told fortunes , and after that there was a steady trickle of clients . To Duncan they were indistinguishablefrom her Buskville clients  --  mostly women , faded housewives and very young girls  --  and their lives were indistinguishabletoo , and their futures , which even he could have predicted , but Justine was patient and kind with them and it was plain they all loved her . In the afternoons , if she had no readings , she came to the cabinetworks and watched Duncanp142build things . At first she was shy among the blunt , sawdusty carpenters , but she warmed up after a while . She made friends with them and told fortunes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even helped out with the work , sitting on a board for someone or sanding down a tabletop . And always she was so joyous . How long could this last ? She said she wanted a baby . Duncan did n't . The idea of a family  --  a closed circle locking him in , some unlucky child whom he would lock in  --  made him feel desperate . Besides , he was not so sure that it was medically sound . Who knew what might be passed on ? He pointed out their heredity : heart murmurs , premature births , their grandfather 's deafness . " But ! " Justine said . " Look at our teeth ! They 're perfect , not a cavity in the lot . Nobody 's ever lost one . " " Justine , if I hear one more word about those goddam teeth  --  " But in the end he gave in . He agreed to a baby the way Justine , he imagined , had agreed to move to Virginia ; he assumedit was necessary for her in some way that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he tried to take an interest . He listened to the details of every doctor 's appointment , he practiced her breathing exercises with her until he grew light-headed . Twice he drove her to Baltimore for overlongvisits with the aunts , who fussed and clucked around her while Duncan skulked nearby with his collar turned up and his hands jammed deep in his pockets . It seemed to him that his part in all this was so incidental . But when he steeled himself to suggest that she might want to go to Baltimore for the birth as well , Justine turned a sudden level gaze on him and said , " No , thank you . I 'll have it here with you . " How did her mind work ? By her seventh month she had started poring over old photographs in the evenings , particularly photographs of her mother . She sat squinting through a magnifying glass , her hard little knot of a stomach straining the faded dress she had worn since she was seventeen . For she had n't bought any maternity clothes . Was she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shopped . He had expected a frilly layette to mount upp143in some bureau drawer , but the only things she had were what the aunts gave her . All the preparation she had made was to start building a cradle at the cabinetworks . And when he offered to get her a maternity dress himself her eyes spilled over with tears , something that almost never happened . " But I do n't want anything . Nothing is right . I could n't stand to buy anything in those stores , " she said . Duncan was mystified . He did the only thing he could think of : he went out and bought three yards of flowered material and a Simplicity dress pattern . He assumed there was not much difference between reading a pattern and a blueprint ; he could figure it out in no time and run it up on Aunt Marybelle 's Singer . But when he got home Justine was in labor , and he had to take her straight to the hospital . It occurredto him during the trip that Justine was going to die @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without admitting it : she would die at an early age because the world was so ironic . The sight of her calm face beside him  --  she was so ignorant !  --  made him furious . " You are not going to leave me with that baby to raise , " he told her , and she turned and looked at him gently , from a distance . " No , of course not , " she said . She was right , of course . The birth was easy . Justine did n't die , she did n't come close to dying . He had been angry for nothing , and on top of that he had an eighty-five-cent pattern now which would never be used , because he 'd be damned if they would ever go through this again . Justine wanted to name the baby Margaret Rose , which was fine with him . But he was a little surprised . He had expected to have to argue against Caroline , or Lucy or Laura or Sarah , none of which he could stand . How long had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Who was never mentioned , not ever , except by Sulie , who had loved Margaret Rose since first arriving to work for the Pecks at age thirteen . Certainly their grandfather never spoke of her . Duncan was curious as to what the old man would say now . Would he object ? But no , when he came for a visit and they told him ( Justine shouting it fearlessly into his good ear , which was turningbad like the other ) , he only nodded as if it meant nothing.  |p144Duncan  should have guessed . Justine knew . In that family wrongdoers vanished without a trace , not even a hole to show where they had been . They called the baby Meg for short . She was a blond , stocky , serious baby whose silvery eyebrows were quirked in a permanent frown . When she learned to walk , she trudged ; if she laughed , it was only after a moment of study . Everything she did was laborious , even stringing wooden beads or feeding a doll or lugging around the large cardboard boxes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It touched Duncan to see her heaving her toys back into the toy chest every evening , unasked . As she grew older , as life became more hurried and scattered , she developed into a housewifely , competentlittle soul who always knew where things were , and what had been forgotten , and when they were supposed to be somewhere . By the age of six she had her own alarm clock , the only one in the house . For her seventh birthday she asked for a pop-up toaster . ( She wanted to make toast like other people , she said , not in the oven . ) She fixed her own breakfast , rinsed her own dishes , and hunted her own socks . Every afternoon when school was over she did her entire homework assignment without being told , her soft yellow head bent low , a pencil clutched tight in her fist . She asked to go both to Sunday school and church , neither of which her parents ever attended ; she went alone , dressed in clothes from her grandmother , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collection plate . Saturday afternoons she read her Bible assignment . " Meggie ! " Justine would say , swooping down on her . " Come outside ! Come play ! " But Meg would have to finish and put everything away before she came . Then Justine took her out visiting other children , or hopscotching , or roller skating . If Justine stretched Meg 's skates to the largest size she could wear them herself , and she demonstrated all she remembered from the old days . In a strong wind she stood still and was blown backwards , with her skirts pressed wide and flat . She leaned on the air like a figurehead , laughing , but Meg watched dubiously with her thumb in her mouth.  | " This is a cricket , " Duncan told Meg . " Ooh . " " Do you want to know how he chirps ? " " No . " " Many people suppose that he does it with his legs but actually  --  " Meg looked not at the cricket but at Duncan . Her eyes were transparent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to feel like a father , but he did . Just the curve of her cheek could give him a wrench , or the blue veins inside her wrist or the stolid way she stood watching other children playing . But he was clearer-sighted than Justine , who thought Meg was perfect . He knew , for instance , that although Meg was of normal intelligence she had a mind that plodded and toiled , with narrow borders ; that she was fiercely anxious ; a for regularity , permanence , order . It seemed to him that he was the object of an enormous joke : he had feared all the geneticdefects but the obvious one , total Peckness . She was more Peck flia'n anybody , more even than stodgy Claude or the soft , placid twins . When she went to Baltimore for a visit she was the darling . There was not one facet of her that was foreign in any way . It was Duncan who was foreign . As she grew older she seemed to realize that , and more and more often the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , defending their two worlds . Then Meg , silenced finally by his quicker tongue , would take on a closed , sad look , and he would be reminded of Justine as a child . He remembered how hopefully Justine would follow her cousins , her eyes anxious , her smile hesitant , her dress as carefully kept as when her mother had buttoned it in the morning . He softened , and gently tweaked a sprig of Meg 's hair until she gave in and smiled . But where was the child Justine had been ? There was nothing hesitant about her now . She had become fast-moving , kaleidoscopic . There was a sort of dash to everything she did that surprised and fascinated him . When she flew down a street people turned to look after her : an angular , frayed , pretty woman who looked as if she had no idea where she was going.  |p146She  still wore the washed-out dresses from her girlhood , their hems adjusted belatedly half a dozen times , either raised to stand out like a spare tire around her knees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruled paper ; and on her feet , Mary Janes with neat little straps ; on her head that everlasting Breton , which Duncan had had to replace , twice , when the crown broke through from all the times she had clutched it to her head on her wild , careening journey through life . Her days consisted of a string of unexpected events . Passing a crazy man talking to himself , for instance ( whom Duncan pretended not to hear ) , Justine stopped to answer whatever question he had asked the clouds and ended up involved for years in the man 's Houdinilikeescapes from asylums . She was the only person Duncan knew who had actually had a baby left on her doorstep . ( Later the mother changed her mind , but Justine had been prepared to keep him . ) At any moment of the day he might catch sight of her driving seventeen third-graders in a fire engine down Main Street , or picketing a whites-only movie theater with the day 's groceries still in her arms , or zipping past his shop window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had owned no dogs at all . And she moved so easily from town to town ! Oh , at first , of course , she was always a little reluctant . " But I like it here . We were just getting settled . " ( She could get settled anywhere , he thought , in a cave or a coal mine even ; she was like a cat . ) " I do n't want to leave all our friends , " she would say . ( Her friends , generally ; Justine made friends by leaps and bounds while Duncan was more gradual . It seemed he had barely started getting close to people when it was time to leave a place . ) " What do we have to go for , Duncan ? " But it was plain what they had to go for  --  there he was , ever grimmer and bleaker , slogging through the days . " Oh , well , " she always said in the end . " We 'll move . We 'll just move , what 's wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light-headed , as if spared from some disaster they had been dreading for weeks . Justine went off too far ahead of time to pack  --  her favorite occupation , which became easier every year as they left more and more things behind . She had very nearly stopped cooking ,  |p147sto|p|ped  cleaning ; she had given away her wedding saucepans as if just being were enough to take all her time and attention . For dinner she served whatever came to mind , forgetting to eat herselfand opening a window instead to beg a street Arab to let Meg have a ride on his horse . " Oh , Mania , " said Meg , who would not think of riding such an animal and wished that her mother would not embarrass her by hanging out windows . But Duncan drifted on this turbulence happily ; during lulls he felt something was missing . When he came home and Justine was out the air seemed empty and dead . He plowed through the rooms calling her name . He went to neighbors . " Is Justine with you ? She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anywhere . " Until , havingtracked her down , he could heave a long sigh and sink onto the nearest flat surface . " I could n't find you . I did n't know where you were . I did n't know what had happened to you . " Then life zoomed into full speed again , the unexpected fluttered all around them like confetti , and Duncan felt peaceful . Sometimes he remembered that she had not always been this way , though he could n't put his finger on just when she had changed . Then he wondered if she only pretended to be happy , for his sake . Or if she were deliberately cutting across her own grain , like an acrophobe who takes up sky diving . He became suddenly thoughtful , offering her perhaps a visit to Baltimore , although still , after all these years , the mere thought of his family filled him with a contrariness he seemed unable to control . Justine was still very fond of the family . When he pointed out for her the meaning beneath their words , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Justine pointed out the meaning beneath that meaning , and he would have to admit some truth in what she said . She had the pathetic alertness of a child who has had to depend too much on adults ; she picked up every inflection , every gesture and untied ribbon and wandering eye , and turned it over and over to study its significance . ( Was that how she could read the future ? She had foretold GreatGrandma'sdeath , she said , when she noticed her buying all her lotions in very tiny bottles . ) So with Justine 's words fresh in his mind he would drive to Baltimore feeling charitable and en/lightened , though that never lasted past the moment of entering staid chilly Roland Park with its damp trees and gloomy houses and its reluctant maids floating almost motionlessly up the hill from the bus stop , following their slow flat feet while their heads held back . And once they had arrived he kept watching her , trying to see if deep down she hated him for taking her away . But Justine was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sudden kisses , knocked Aunt Bea 's spectaclesaskew , swooped through the house causing all the fairy lamps and figurines to tremble on the tables , and once at supper she accidentally ate the little glass spoon from her salt dish . All the aunts jumped up and wrung their hands , but Duncan smiled and his forehead smoothed and he rested back upon the white , tumbling waters of life with Justine . Now the aunts and uncles were old , the grandfather wore a hearing aid , and the cousins ( Sally divorced , the rest unmarried , all childless ) were developing lines and sags in their curiouslyinnocent faces like aging midgets . The lawns had grown meager and the fleet of Fords was outdated . The only servant was old Sulie , who shuffled around angry about something , as she had been for years , stirring the dust back and forth with a wilted gray rag . Great-Grandma 's house was inhabited by Esther and the twins , but Justine was the legal owner . Someday , everyone said , Justine and Duncan would want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did this house would be ready . Justine only smiled . Of course they would never live there . Yet always in the backs of their minds it waited as a last resort , if all else failed , if they ever were forced to admit defeat . It figured in back-up plans ; it moved in on them , inch by inch , whenever money was tight and jobs were scarce , and over the years it had come to contain an imaginary life parallel to their own , advancing when theirs did . They knew what nursery school they would have sent Meg to if they had lived here , and then what grammar school ; what pharmacy they would have patronized and where they would have gone for their groceries . Yet only one glance at that house , where it loomed beneath the oaks , was enough to make Duncan grow dark and hollow andp149he would suddenly lay a hand on Justine 's thigh as if she were a square of sunlight on a windowseat , and he just in from the cold . AN INFERIOR CLASS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glared at them : three sailors , a colored boy in a crocheted cap , and a sallow , weasely woman with four children whom she kept slapping and pinching . One of the children stuck out his tongue . " Look at there . Did you see that ? " Daniel asked his granddaughter . She glanced up from her magazine . " Child made a face at me . " She smiled . " Well , there 's nothing funny about it , Justine . " Whatever she said , he did n't quite catch . It bothered him to go motoring with his hearing aid on . They were returning from Parthenon , Delaware , where finally , after a great deal of tedious correspondence , he had located the youngest son of the past headmaster of Salter Academy . A Mr. Dillard . Mr. Dillard had already informed him by letter that he had never kept in touch with any of his father 's students ( who were older than he and not likely to be among the living anyway , he said tactlessly ) , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affair . Sometimes little things could jog it , he knew , sometimes so small a thing as the smell of clover or the sight of a boy wobbling on a bicycle . So he had come in person , bringing his photograph of Caleb and prepared to offer any detail he could think of , a whole wealthp150of detail flattened and dried in his mind . " He was a tardy boy , always tardy . Perhaps your father mentioned having a student with a tardiness problem . And let 's see , he was extremely sociable . Surely if there had ever been a class reunion of any sort he would have attended . Or just come visiting , do n't you know . Perhaps come visiting your father years later , he would do that sort of thing . Can you remember such a visitor ? Tall boy , blond , this picture does n't quite show . He had a habit of tilting his head when listening to people . If you were a child he passed on his way to your father 's study , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Though he was not a smiling person . Did you see him ? Do you know ? " But Mr. Dillard did not know . A stooped , red-faced man who would n't speak up . There were cartoon fishes all over his bathroom wallpaper . His wife was nice , though . Lovely lady . She offered them homemade butter mints , the first he had tasted in years , and gave Justine the recipe on an index card . He set his face toward Justine , waiting till she would feel it and raise her head again . " Yes , Grandfather , " she said . " What 'd you do with that recipe ? " She looked blank . " Recipe card Mrs. Dillard gave you . " " Oh ! " " Do n't tell me you lost it . " " Oh no . No , I  --  " He did n't know the rest of what she said but he could seeher plainly enough , rummaging through her crushed straw bagand then her dress pockets , one of which was torn halfway off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine butter mints again . He removed a large leather wallet from the inner breastpocket of his suit coat . He took out a cream-colored envelopeand a sheet of stationery . The envelope was already stampedand addressed . He was very well organized . His stepmotherhad taught him years ago : compose your card of thanks on thecarriage ride home . Never allow an hour to elapse before writing a bread-and-butter note . " Then why , " Duncan had askedas a child , " do n't we write the whole letter ahead of time ? " Butp151no , that would n't do at all . You had to mention something personalthat had occurred during the visit , do n't you see . As Daniel did now , after frowning a moment at his pen . Dear Mrs. Dillard , March 5 , 1973I write to express my appreciation for your hospitality . Your butter mints were extremely tasty , and it was very kind of you to take the time to see us . We shall remember our visit to you with a great deal of pleasure . Respectfully , Daniel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or wherever he would type a copy of this note for his files . He liked to keep a record of all correspondence , particularly that regarding Caleb . His old Underwood typewriter , with its metal keys and high black forehead , was forever set up on the bureau by his bed ; his file cabinet was packed solid with letters of inquiry , thank you letters , follow-up letters , for how many years back ? How many years ? Well , his stepmother died in 1958 . That was a hard time . She was the last person on this earth who called him Daniel . He had not realized that until she died . She had journeyed through all his life with him , minus the first few months : seventy-seven years . The only person who remembered his kid soldier doll , and his father 's way of widening his eyes when displeased , and the rough warm Belgian blocks that used to pave the streets downtown . She left her house to Justine , and he knew why . ( She was uneasy in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the most defenseless , dragged from pillar to post by harum-scarum Duncan , whom marriage had not toned down in the least . ) But for months after her death Daniel would not enter her house or look at it , and although he allowed Esther and the twins to move in he told them to stay out of her bedroom . He would sort her things later , he said ; he was just a little busy right now . He walked around feeling wounded , struck as if for the first time by the fact that the world kept progressing and people aged and died and nothing in life wasp153reversible . Where had it all gone to ? Whatever happened to that little brown German step-grandfather he used to have ? Or Sarah Cantleigh 's family , who cried whenever they saw him , . were they all dead by now ? Where was that silent , musical brother of his with the tilted head ? But he was a sensible man , and in time he recovered . Then he sent for Sulie with her ring of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh , my soul , " Sulie kept saying . " My soul . " She had been mad at Laura for decades , but she looked stricken as she gazed around the dark , stale room . Her eyes were triangular and the cords stood out in her neck . She had a wrinkled face like a yellow paper kite . " So this is what it all come to , " she said . " Now if you do n't stop that , " Daniel told her , " you can just go on back to the kitchen , hear ? " He left the clothes for the women to deal with ; that was none of his business . What concerned him were her desk drawers , jewelry boxes , and knick-knack shelves , which held little mementos that should be parceled out among the family . He opened drawers guiltily , shamed by the puffs of lavender scent that rose from everything as if she were still in the room somewhere . " Well , I just do n't know , " he said to each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laid it aside Sulie would pick it up and say , " Miss Sarah always admire this , " or " Miss Bea always saying how she wish she had one like it . " " Take it to her then . Fine . Fine , " said Daniel . He kept nothing for himself . Those neat drawers , with everything arranged so precisely and all for nothing , took away his interest in life . And maybe Sulie 's , too . At any rate , when he offered her the oval brooch that contained a plait of Laura 's mother 's hair and had only one little thing wrong with the clasp , Sulie 's mouth turned downward . " I do n't want it , " she said . " Suit yourself , " he told her . Not everyone would put up with Sulie 's rudeness the way he did . In a desk drawer behind a stack of stationery he found an ancient brittle advertisement for Baum 's Fine Cutlery . Beneathp153it , an envelope that looked as if it had been handled a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cello in a stable loft . Now , where did that come from ? He had never seen it before , but from the poor focus and the haphazard composition he guessed that it was the work of Margaret argaret Rose that summer she got her Brownie . For a few months she had wandered everywhere , photographing the most unlikely things : Sulie stringing beans , Sarah on her rocking horse , Lafleur Boudrault playing cigar-box guitar and Mark with a mouthful of honeysuckle blossoms . ( Daniel had known she was gone for good when he found all her photos of the children missing . But enough of that . ) He peered at Caleb 's blurred , sharp-featured face . So far as he knew this was the only picture of Caleb in existence . Not counting the one in the album : age two , wearing a ruffled dress and holding an open book he could not possibly have read . And of course all traces of Margaret Rose had been systematically destroyed long ago . Yet in a sense this was a picture of her too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things ; and her presence could be inferred from the head-on , quizzical look Caleb directed to the camera holder  --  an expression he reserved for Margaret Rose . Daniel passed a hand over his eyes . " I believe that will be all for today , Sulie , " he said . " What , you quitting ? " " For now . " " Leaving this mess any which old way ? " " Later I 'll tend to it . " When he left she was poking the piles of belongings with angry , crabbed hands , muttering beneath her breath . He did n't care to hear what she was saying . Then for several evenings in a row he sat alone in his bedroomstudying the photograph , testing the new feeling of sorrowthat drove straight through his ribcage . And when that was absorbed ( not lessened , just adjusted to ) he became , he admitted , a little crazy . He began wondering if this photo did n't have some secret message to it . It was impossible for such anp154object just to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Caleb 's hat , the set of his cello , the shreds left on the stable wall by some old poster . What was the significance ? Meanwhile his bachelor son and his two spinster daughters whispered downstairs , wondering what he could be doing . When Laura May knocked on his door , he jumped and shoved the photo into his pocket . All she found was her father in his easy chair with his arms folded unnaturallyacross his front . Then he went to Lucy , who played a little piano still . He pulled her aside one day when she was counting Mason jars in the pantry . " Lucy , " he said , " you know music . " " Oh , Father Peck , I  --  " " Look here . What note is this man playing ? " He showed her the photo . Surprise set little sharp pleats across her forehead . " Why , who  --  " she said . " What note is he playing ? " " Oh , well , I do n't  --  actually , it does n't look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " What ? Speak up . " " Not any note . " " Why , how is that possible ? No note at all ? I never heard of such a thing . " " It looks to me as if he 's just resting his bow on the strings , Father Peck . " " But that would be ridiculous . " " Oh , no , it 's really quite  --  " " I never heard of such a thing , " he said , and then he slammed out of the pantry . Already he knew he had made a mistake . For Lucy , of course , had to go and tell Two , and Two out of all the family was the most certain to recognize a description of Caleb . Then everybody knew , and everybody asked him what he thought he was up to . Caleb was best forgotten . He was surely dead by now . What did it matter what note he had played on a summer'sday in 1910 ? When Justine visited home that August , she came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tree . She kissed his cheekp155and drew back and looked at him . He could tell she had heard something . They had all been discussing him behind his back . I lc snorted . " You know , of course , that I am non cornpos mentis , " he told her . She went on studying him , as if she took what he had said eriously . A literal-minded girl , Justine . Always had been . " Could I see Caleb ? " she asked finally . " Pardon ? " He thought he had heard wrong . " Your picture of Caleb . " " The others are asking not to see it . " " But I do n't even know what he looks like , " she said . He frowned at her . Well , no , of course she would n't . Probably did n't know much of anything about him . Laura never let his name cross her lips ; he seldom had himself ; and to the others Caleb was nearly forgotten , a distant grownup uncle whom they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . He drew out the photograph , protected now by glass . " My brother , " he said . " I see , " said Justine . " Generally he did not go about in his shirtsleeves , how-ever . " Justine bent over the photograph . Her lowered eyelids remindedhim of wings . " He looks like you , " she said . " But his eyes were brown . " " His face is the same . " " Yes , I know , " said Daniel , and he sighed . He took back the picture . " The others , you see , they do n't count him any more . To them he 's a deserter . " Justine said something he could n't catch . " Eh ? To me , " he said , " he is still a member here . He goes back to nearly as long ago as I can recollect . I just like to think of him , is all . What 's wrong with that ? " " Not a thing , " Justine said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life if I could set eyes on him again . "  |p156She  said something else . He took a swipe at the air , protestingthe curtain of muffled sound that separated them . " If I could just walk to church with him once more , " he told her , " only this time , paying closer attention , do n't you see . If I could pass by the Salter Academy and look in the window and see him wave , or hear him play that foolish messy music of his on the piano in the parlor  --  if they could just give me back one little scrap of time , that 's all I ask ! " " Oh , well , " said Justine . " Come around to the front , Grandfather , see how Meg 's grown . " And then she took him by the hand , so that he had to rise and follow . In a way , he was a little disappointed in Justine . He had thought she might understand his viewpoint , but if she did she did n't let on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , waterlogged day , he received an envelope postmarked Honora , Maryland , where Justine was living at the time . There was no letter , only a clippingfrom the Honora Herald , a whole page devoted to education . He was puzzled . Education did not much interest him . But wait : at the bottom was a very old-fashioned photograph of rows and rows of young boys . The caption said : THE GOOD OLD DAYSAbove , the author 's own school , Salter Academy in Baltimore , around the turn of the century . Note gaslights along the walls . Author is in seated row , second from left . Daniel took off for Honora within the hour , driving his V-8 Ford . He arrived at Justine 's house waving the clipping . Justine was in the kitchen reading some lady 's future  --  an occupationhe and all the family preferred to ignore . " Never mind that , " he told her . " I want to see Ashley Higham . " " Who 's Ashley Higham ? " " The man who wrote this piece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do know him ! " Justine said . " No I do n't know him , do n't know him from Adam , but it says right here he went to Salter Academy , does n't it ? Says thisp157is him seated , second from left , and not an arm 's length away from him is my own brother Caleb , is n't it ? " " Is that right ? " said Justine . She set down her cards and got up to have a look . So did the lady , not that it was any of her business . " Now all I 've got to do is find Ashley Higham , " Daniel said . " Oh , well , Grandfather , I do n't really know where  --  " " I know , " said the lady . So it was the lady who led the way to Ashley Higham . And Mr. Higham did , in fact , remember Caleb well , but had not seen him since graduation day in 1903 . However , he had a remarkablemind and could reel off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowly traversing the rows of faces . Daniel recorded each name on a sheet of paper . Later he would copy them into a pocket-sized ring notebook that he carried with him everywhere , gradually stuffing it fatter and fatter . For one thing led to another , one man remembered another who had been a friend of Caleb 's and that man remembered Caleb 's elocution teacher , who turned out to be deceased but his grand-sonin Pennsylvania had saved all his correspondence and from that Daniel found the name of the geography teacher , and so on . 1 lis files began filling up . His Ford clocked more miles in a year than it had in all its past life . And bit by bit , as the rest of the jt family grew more disapproving ( first arguing reasonably , then trying to distract him with television and scrapbooks and homemadepie , finally stealing his car keys whenever his back was turned ) he began staying for longer periods of time with Justine . Only visiting , of course . It would never do for Caleb to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His house still waited for him in Baltimore , his daughters still kept his room made up . But Justine was the only one who would hop into the car with him at a moment 's notice , and go anywhere , and talk to anyone and interpret all the mumbled answers . And when he was discouraged , Justine was the one ) who bolstered his confidence again.  |p158For  he did get discouraged , at first . At first he was in such a hurry , He thought he was right around the corner from success , that was why . Then when he traveled clear across the state to find Caleb 's oldest , dearest friend and learned that he had last seen Caleb in 1909 , he grew morose and bitter . " I always assumed , " he told Justine , " that people keep in touch , that if they lose touch they go back and pick it up again , do n't you know . Of course I am more a family man myself , family 's been my social life . But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best friend long enough , you would be certain to see the man himself eventually . Well , not Caleb . In fifty years he has not once gone back to pay a call , and his friend has never done a thing about it . What do you make of that ? " Justine said , " Never mind , Grandfather . It will work out . " ( Was she speaking professionally ? ) And the next morning she was perfectly willing to set off again , cheerful as ever , never losing patience . So there was no need to hurry after all . He began to relax . He began to enjoy the search itself , the endless rattling rides , the motionless blue sky outside the window of his train . ( For they had quickly switched to railroad , as his deafnesshad caused several near accidents and Justine 's driving terrified him . ) In the old days , merely a business trip to New York had made him feel like a ball of yarn rolling down the road , unwinding his tail of homesickness behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But now he learned to concentrate solely on the act of traveling . He liked to imagine that Caleb himself had ridden this very train . He bobbled along on the Southern Railroad Line or the B &; 0 , on dusty plush seats , occasionally stretching his legs on some small-town platform where , perhaps , Caleb had stood before him . And he returned home as confident as when he left , for there was always time to search further , next week or next month or whenever he felt up to it . If Duncan minded this permanent visit , he never said so . In the beginning Daniel had asked him outright . ( Well , as outrightas he could get . ) " Nowadays , people seem to prefer a minimum of adults in one household , have you noticed ? " hep159had said . But Duncan only smiled . " Some do , some do n't , " he said . Another of those unexplained remarks of his . He did it on /nir pose . Daniel mulled for several days , and then he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept close family ties , " he told her , and waited , trustingly , for her to understand . She did . " That 's true , " she said , " but he has n't said anything so far . " And Daniel was careful to see that he never gave Duncan reason to . He held back from advice ( which Lord knows the boy could have used ) and praise and criticism . He accepted every change of address without question , although none of them were the least bit necessary . Did n't it occur to Duncan t hat other people had low periods too , and just sat them out instead of packing up bag and baggage ? You endure , you manage to survive , he had never heard of someone so consistently refusing to . But never mind , he did n't say a word . He went uncomplaininglyto each new town , he accepted Justine 's half-hearted cooking and cleaning , which were , he assumed , the natural result of failing to give a woman any permanence in her life . Why should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked flung down , that seemed to be cowering in expectation of the next disaster ? And meanwhile Laura 's fine place was sitting empty . ( He did n't count Esther and the twins living there , for really they belonged at home with their parents . ) But leave it be , leave it be . The only change he made in their lives was to deed his Ford to them once he quit driving . It made him nervous to ride about in the Graham Paige , for which Duncan had to haunt antique shows every time a part wore out . " But I do n't like Fords , " Duncan said . " I have a deep-seated hatred of Fords , " and for half a year they had been a two-car family , Justine dartingabout in the Ford and Duncan in the Graham Paige , whistlingcheerfully and looking down from time to time to watch the highway skating along beneath the holes in the floorboards . The engine , he said , was in fine shape , and no doubt it was , for Duncan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something to put an engine in , not this collection of green metal lace and sprung springs ; and on moving day that year , without ap160word , Duncan had left it sitting in front of the house and driven off in the U-Haul . His grandfather pretended not to notice . He was a tactful man . He lived in his own tiny , circular world within their larger one . While they moved up and down the eastern seaboard , made their unaccountable decisions , took up their strange acquaintancesand then lost them and forgot them , Daniel Peck buttonedhis collarless shirt and fastened his pearl-gray suspenders and surveyed his white , impassive face in the bedroom mirror . He wound his gold watch . He tidied his bed . He transformed even his journeys , the most uncertain part of his life , into models of order and routine and predictability . For Justine was always with him , he always had the window seat , she read her National Geographic , they carried on their spasmodic , elliptical conversationsover the noise of the road . Now they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was all most towns had these days . They would take long circuitous routes in order to join up someplace , somehow , with a railroad , and even then it was usually Amtrak , a garish untrainlike train where nothing went right , where certainly Caleb had never set foot in his life . But still Daniel traveled calm and expressionless , his hands on his knees , a ten-dollar bill pinned inside his undershirt , and his granddaughter 's hat brim comfortingly steadfast in the righthandcorner of his vision . They were drawing close to what's-its-name , Caro Mill . He noticed people rising to put their coats on , and lifting suitcases down from the rack . He noticed within himself a sudden feeling of emptiness . So they were back again , were they ? He sighed . Justine looked up again from her magazine . " We did n't get much done , " he told her . " Why , no . " To her it did n't matter . She thought he felt the same , he had ridden content beside her for so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense of impatience , as in the old days when he first began his search . Did that mean he was drawing close to Caleb ? Once he almost asked her outright for a reading from her cards  --  ridiculous business . Of course he had stopped him/self in time . Now he stared bleakly out the window at a jumble of service stations and doughnut shops . " So this is where we 're headed , " he said . " What ? " " It 's not much of a place to come back to . " " Oh  --  " said Justine , and then something else he could n't catch , but he knew it would be cheerful . Justine did not seem to be easily disappointed . Which was fortunate . Whereas he himself was leaden with disappointment , sinking fast . He felt there was something hopeless about the deep orange sunset glowing beyond an auto junkyard . " Grandfather ? " Justine asked , in her most carrying tone . " Are you all right ? " " Yes , certainly . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It stopped in front of the Caro Mill Diner . Place could n't have a regular terminal , no . Out they had to climb , in the middle of the street . The driver did not so much as give Justine a hand down the steps , or either of the other ladies ; Daniel had to do it . He touched his temple for each one in turn as he let go of her arm . " Why , thank you , " one lady told him . The other did n't say a word , or else he missed it . In front of the diner sat the Ford , three feet from a hydrant , battered and dusty and bearing a long new dent in the rear bumper . He studied the damage . In the old days people left notes about such things , giving their names and telephone numbers . Not any more . When he finally climbed into the car he said , " Conscience has vanished . " " Excuse me ? " Justine looked at him , one hand outstretched toward her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What 's vanished ? " " Conscience , I said . They dent your bumper and do n't even leave a note . " " Perhaps I , " said Justine , and something else . " No , if you had done it I would have noticed . Besides , you 've had this week 's accident . " His little joke . He laughed , covering his mouth with his fist to turn it into a cough.  |p162Then  , wham ! He was jarred and knocked into the windshield . Aches and pains started up all over , instantly . It seemed that someone had reached down a gigantic hand and flung him like a doll . " Grandfather ? " Justine asked . There was a long red welt on the inside of her arm , and a few dots of blood . Just past her , a car had stopped and a man was climbing out . And where the door had been swinging open there was nothing now at all , just clear blank air and then the man 's angry face . The man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It did n't matter ; Daniel was just relieved to see the cause of his shake-up . Of course , a door torn off ! Yet he continued to feel disoriented . When the man had driven away , and Justine stepped out to drag the door to the trunk and heave it in , he was still so dazed that he did n't offer to help . He watched numbly as she slid behind the wheel again . " At least we 're well ventilated , " she told him . A strange thing to say , or perhaps he had misunderstood . He wished he were home . He raced through the hallways of his mind calling out for Laura , his father , Caleb , Margaret Rose . But really he should never have married Margaret Rose . A shared background was the important thing . If he had not been such a fool for her chuckling laugh and the tender , subtle curve at the small of her back he would have made a more sensible choice , a person he had known all his life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her parents ? Melissa , Melinda ? But he had wanted someone new and surprising . A terrible mistake . How he hated Margaret Rose ! The thought of her made him grind his teeth . He would like to know where she was now so that he could do something dreadful to her , humiliate her in front of all her fancy , tinkling friends . But no , she was dead . He was so disappointed to remember . As usual she had done something first , run ahead of him laughing and looking back at him over her shoulder , and for once he could not refuse to follow . " Once you 're alive , there 's no way out but dying , " he told Justine . She looked over at him . " You 've set a thing in motion , you see . " " It 's like being pregnant , " said Justine . Of course shep163could n't really have said that . His ears were bad . His mind was bad . He was going to have to get a hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window , a respectable elderly gentleman admiring the view as they rattled homeward . Meg Peck and the Reverend Arthur Milsom were sitting in the living room waiting for Meg 's parents . Or Arthur was sitting ; Meg kept moving around . First she chose the armchair because she wanted to look proper and adult . Then she thought it was more natural to sit next to Arthur on the couch . They were about to ask permission to get married ; what would they be doing across the room from each other ? Arthur had on his clerical collar , which was n't absolutely required but it looked very nice . He was a young , pale , tense man , small but wiry . When he was nervous he cracked his knuckles and his brown eyes grew so dark and sober that he seemed to be glaring . " Do n't be nervous , " Meg told him , sitting back down on the couch . She reached over and took his damp hand . This visit had been planned for weeks . The first Monday after she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her parents . ( Monday was a slow day at the church . ) They had worked it out by letter . It was Arthur 's feeling that Duncan was the important one , but as Meg pointed out they needed Justine there to smooth things over . For certainly Duncan would be at his sharpest . He did n't like Arthur . ( How could anyone not like Arthur ? ) What they had n't counted on was Justine 's vanishing , taking Grandfather on one of his trips . Now there was no telling when she would be back , and meanwhile Duncan was coming home from work at any minute . They would have to handle him alone after all . Meg always thought of her parents as Duncan and Justine , although she did n't call them that . It might have been due to the way they acted . They were not very parent-like . She loved them both , but she had developed a permanent inner cringe from wondering how they would embarrass her next . They were so  --  extreme . So irresponsible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going off on some tangent , calling over their shoulders for her to come too . And for as long as Meg could remember she had been stumbling after , picking up the trail of cast-off belongings and abandoned projects . All she really wanted was to live like other people . She tried to keep the house neat , like her friends ' houses , and to put flowers in the vases and to hide , somehow , whatever tangle of tubes and electrical wires Duncan was working on at the moment . But then it seemed so hopeless when she knew how soon they would be moving on . " We 're nomads , " Justine told her , " think of it that way "  --  as if making it sound romantic would help . But there was nothing romantic about this tedious round of utility deposits , rental contracts , high school transcripts and interrupted magazine subscriptions . " He 's ruining our lives ! " she told Justine . Justine looked astonished . " But Meggie darling , we ca n't be the ones to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother , too , who was so gullible and so quick to give in , and she closed herself up in her room ( if they were in a house where she had a room ) and said no more . She kept herself occupied with sewing , or pasting pictures in her scrapbook full of model homes  --  French windows and carpeted kitchens and white velvet couches . She straightened up her closet with all her shoes set side by side and pointing in the same direction . She ironed her own dresses , as she had since she was nine . ( Justine thought there was no point to ironing , as long as things were clean . ) At the age of ten she had baked her first cake , which everyone admired but no one ate because they were too busy rushing off somewhere ; they seemed to live on potato chips from vending machines . Nothing ever worked on a schedule . She was encouraged to bring her friends home at any hour of the day or night . " This family is not a closed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rule , if you could call it that . But how could she bring friends when her parents were so certain to make fools of themselves ? " Oh , I just love your folks , " girls were always saying , little dreaming what agony it would be to have them for their own . For Justine might be found barefoot and waving her dirty playing cards , or sitting at the kitchenp165table with three or four unsuitable friends , or racing about looking for her broken straw carry-all in order to go to the diner whose food she preferred to her own . She had a high-handed , boisterous way of acting sometimes and she was likely to refer to Duncan publicly as " Meg 's second cousin , " her idea of a joke . And Duncan ! Spouting irrelevant , useless facts , thinking out loud in startling ways , leaving her friends stunned and stupidlooking . His idea of a joke was to hang idiotic newspaper and ladies ' magazine pages all over the house , bearing what he thought were appropriate messages . On Justine 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ INCREASING OUR INTEREST , and after Meg spent too much money on a dress ( only because she wanted to look like the other girls for a change , not all homemade and tacked together ) she found a page Scotch-taped to her closet door : HAVE YOU EVER HADA BAD TIME IN LEVI 'S ? Then she had snatched up the page and stalked in to where Duncan sat inventing a new keyboard arrangement for the typewriter . " Act your age ! " she told him . But when he looked up his face was so surprised and unguarded , and she saw that he really was aging , there were dry lines around his eyes and two tiny crescents left by his wide , dippy smile . So she laid the paper down gently , after all , and went away defeated . Now she sighed , remembering , and Arthur squeezed her fingers . " In an hour this will all be over , " he told her . " It will never be over . " " I do n't understand . " " We 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I feel it . " But now she had insulted him . He straightened up , which made him look smaller . He said , " Do n't you think I can have a reasonable discussion with my own girl 's parents ? " " Yes but  --  " " You forget , I 'm a minister . I 've convinced families who swore they 'd cut off their daughters without a penny . I 've convincedfathers who claimed that  --  "  | " But it was n't you their daughters were marrying . " " Now do n't worry . If worst comes to worst we 'll just go away quietly and have the ceremony in my own church . " But neither of them wanted that . They wanted everything perfect . Arthur wanted her to be happy , and Meg would only be happy with a white dress that dipped to a point at the waist , Sarah Cantleigh 's veil , and a bouquet of baby 's breath . She wanted to walk down the aisle of the family 's church in Baltimorewhere her mother had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rows of aunts and uncles and second cousins , grave Peck eyes approving her choice . Bridal showers , long-grained rice , Great-Grandma 's sixpence in her shoe . Arthur waiting beside the minister , turning his pale , shiny face to watch her procession . Whenever he looked at her , she felt queenly . All right , so he was not a handsome man , but would a handsome man treat her as adoringly as Arthur Milsom did ? When they went to lectures she looked at the lecturer and Arthur looked at her . She felt the thin moon of his face turned upon her . He assisted her in and out of cars , through doorways , up the shalloweststeps , his hands just barely brushing her . ( The aunts would love his manners . ) He devoted his entire attention to her , so much so that sometimes , he said , he worried about his jealous God . Nobody had ever , in all her life , felt that way about her before . A car drove up in front of the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " Meg said . " Look , she beat him home after all . " She rose and went out to the porch . Justine was still seated behind the wheel , straight-backed and prim , unguardedby even the vestige of a door . The car looked like a cross-section of something . But , " Certainly makes it easier to get in and out ! " she called to Meg , and she waved gaily and stepped onto the sidewalk . " Corning , Grandfather ? " " Mama , I want to talk to you , " Meg said . But then up spoke Dorcas Britt , the lady next door , calling over the hedge in a large , rich voice that seemed to mock Meg 's . " Justine , honey ! I got to talk to you . "  | " A man came along doing eighty and flung Grandfather into the windshield , " Justine said . " Mama . " The house was swept suddenly with a variety of colors and shapes  --  the white , tottering grandfather , Justine flicking back her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patent-leather spike-heeled sandals . Arthur stood up with his fingers laced in front of him , as he did when greeting church members after the sermon . He wore a determined smile . Meg felt a twist ; was she doomed to be embarrassed by everyone , all her life , even Arthur ? " Mama , Grandfather , you remember Arthur , " she said . " Mrs. Britt , this is Arthur , my  --  Arthur Mil-som . " " My baby has been kidnapped , " Dorcas told him . Her baby was nine years old and she was kidnapped regularly , always by her father , who did not have visiting rights , but Arthur did n't know that and he grew white around the lips . " Oh , my heavens ! " he cried . " Arthur . It 's all right , " Meg told him . " All right ? " said Dorcas . " To you , maybe . " " Grandfather was zonked in the forehead , " Justine said . Which caused Arthur to spin next in the grandfather 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sympathy . He had n't learned yet . Such an expenditure of emotion would drain you in no time , living here . " Arthur , " Meg said . " The man was going eighty , at least , " said Justine . " How else could he have ripped a door clean off like that ? " " It was already hanging by one hinge , Mama . " " You were going eighty , ' I told him , but guess what he said ? It 's against the law to open a car door on the street side . Did you know that ? How are we supposed to get into our cars ? " " Perhaps from the sidewalk side , " Arthur said carefully . Justine paused , in the middle of removing her hat , and looked over at him . " Oh . Arthur , " she said . " Why , how areyou ? "  | " I 'm just fine , thank you , Mrs. Peck . How are you ? " " And Meg ! Meggie , did you find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going off today . Did you have anything to eat when you came home from school ? " She did n't wait for an answer . She kissed Meg on the cheek  --  a breath of Luden 's cough drops . Whenever she kissed people she gave them quick little pats on the shoulder . Meg drew away , trying to regather her dignity . " Mama , when you get a moment , " she said . " But I have a moment . All the time in the world . What can I do for you ? " " Do n't you have to start supper ? " She meant , Ca n't you come out in the kitchen and talk without Dorcas ? But Justine said , " Oh , I thought we would just have pick-ups tonight . " The only one who understood Meg was Dorcas , who drew herself in while remaining , somehow , as billowy and bosomy as a featherbed . A fat blonde with tiny hands and feet . " You are not -a mother , " she said . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something I can just go home and forget until a more convenient time . " " Perhaps if you called the police , " said Arthur . " Police ! Ha ! " " Mama , I want to talk to you a second . " " All right . " " I mean , privately . " " Honey , ca n't you talk here ? Dorcas is a friend , we do n't have to be private from her . " " I should say not , " said Dorcas . " Well , I 'll wait till Daddy comes home , " Meg said . " Oh , Duncan ! Where is he ? Should n't he be here by now ? " And off she flew to the window , with Dorcas tripping behind her on her ridiculous shoes . " Look here , Justine , you got to help . Wo n't you lay the cards ? I got to know where AnnCampbellis . " " Oh , well , I 'm sure she 's all right . " Ann-Campbell would be all right anywhere . Meg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as usual . " Butp169maybe just a quick reading , " she said . And off they went to the kitchen for the cards . Grandfather Peck stood teetering from heel to toe , peering after them . " Are they going to make supper ? " he asked Meg . " They 're doing a reading , Grandfather . " " A what ? " " Reading . " " What would they be reading now ? It 's suppertime . " He sat down suddenly in the armchair . There was a long knot growing on his forehead . " Grandfather , you 're turning purple , " Meg said . " Ah ? " " Perhaps he needs medical attention , " Arthur whispered . But the grandfather , who could sometimes hear astonishing things , slapped his knee and said , " Nonsense ! " Then there was a blue-and-yellow flash in the door  --  Duncan , wearing the jeans Mr. Amsel had asked him not to . He sprinted across the hall and into the coat closet . " Daddy ? " Meg said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night ? " " I do n't know . " " Do you have to put everything away all the time ? " " I did n't put it anywhere . " " Never mind , I found it . " Off he went again . The door slammed . Arthur began strokinghis chin thoughtfully . " Was that Duncan ? " the grandfather asked . " Yes , Grandfather . " " You 're a pastor , " he told Arthur . " Assistant pastor , yes sir . " " Here 's an idea for a sermon . " " Grandfather . " " All our misery comes from the length of our childhood . Ever thought of that ? " " No , sir , I do n't believe I have . " " Look at it this way . Everything arises from boredom , right ? Irritation , loneliness , violence , stupidity  --  all from bore/dom . Now . Why are we bored ? Because the human childhood is so durned lengthy , that 's why . Because it takes us so durned long to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting . Why , after that just anything would be an anticlimax . " " Sugar , " Duncan called , crossing the front hall again . " How 's that ? " " Eat more sugar . " " What 'd he say ? " Duncan stuck his head in the living room door . " Sugar hastens puberty , " he said . " All the Eskimos are growing up faster now they 've switched to carbohydrates . " Grandfather Peck scratched his head . " Daddy , " said Meg , " we want to talk to you . " " Ah so , Meggie . " But then he saw Arthur . " Why , looky there , a man of the cloth . " " Daddy , when Mama gets through  --  " " Where is your mother ? " " She 's reading the cards for Dorcas . " Arthur stood up . Next to Duncan he looked very small and stalwart . " Actually , Mr. Peck , " he said , " I feel it would be quite enough just to talk to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Duncan . " When I became a man , " the grandfather said , " I caught myself thinking , many times , so this is what it 's like to be grown up ! Plodding back and forth , between work and home . Even being a judge was not what I had hoped . Really you do n't make judgments at all ; you simply relate what happens today to what has happened yesterday , all the precedents and statutes and amendments . And when you 've waded through that , what next ? You get old . And you 're old for years and years and years . Your hearing goes and your knees go . Some people 's teeth go . I myself have kept all my teeth but I would n't say it has done much good . After all , whatever I eat I ate a thousand times before . In addition I have become more and more conscious of where the food comes from . Pork tastes like pigs , beef like cows , lamb like sheep 's wool , and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treat , nauseates me now . I taste the smell of cow barns . " " I wonder , " said Duncan . " If we ran some experiments with goat 's milk chocolate  --  " " The Chinese venerate age . If I were in China people would come to me and say , You 're old and wise . What 's the meaning of it all ? ' " " What is the meaning of it all ? " Duncan asked . " I do n't know , " his grandfather told him . " Mr. Peck , " said Arthur , " I would like to marry your daughter . " The grandfather said , " My daughter ? " But Duncan understood . He gave Arthur a long , clear , untroubledlook , as if nothing such a man could say would bother him . Then he said , " She 's seventeen . " " Eighteen , " said Meg . " Eighteen ? Oh yes . " " And Arthur 's twenty-six . " " Well , that 's ridiculous , " said Duncan . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " So ? " " And you 're still in school . " " We 're planning a June wedding , " said Arthur . " She 'll be graduated by then . " " And Daddy , you know I 'm not the college type . " " Who is ? Who cares about college ? Did I ever say I wanted you to go to college ? But I did n't say I wanted you to get married right off the bat , either , and go live in Simper , Virginia , sitting in the front pew every Sunday nodding all the flowers off your hat . It 's a trap . Do you want to be trapped ? I thought you would go off and do something , Meggie , travel somewhere . Leave old Caramel behind if you like , we 're not trying to keep you for ourselves . Hitch-hike to California . Take a freight train . Take a bus . Learn to surf . Marry somebody unpredictable . Join the Foreign Legion . " " But I ca n't be that way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just settling for it does n't matter who , any pale fish in a suit  --  " " Mr. Peck , " said Arthur , " I understand , of course , that in the heat of the moment  --  " " How will you have babies , Reverend Mildew , osmosis ? " " Mama ! " Meg called . " Do n't trouble your mother , Meg , I 'll see him out myself . " " Unfortunately I am not that easy to discourage , " Arthur said . " That is unfortunate . " But Duncan was guiding him toward the door anyway , and Arthur was allowing it . " Now , " said Duncan , " if by any strange chance Meg still feels the same when she is of a decent age , Reverend , I admit there is nothing I can do about it . Meanwhile , goodbye . " " But I am of age ! " Meg said . The front screen slammed . Meg looked at her great-grandfather , who smiled a weary smile showing every one of his perfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " Meg , " said Dorcas , " your mother 's a marvel . My cards say Ann-Campbell is with Joe Pete and I 'm to enjoy the rest while she 's gone . " " Mama , listen . " Justine looked up . She was seated at the kitchen table , holdingboth hands rigid . Between each finger were long sprays of raw spaghetti . " Look , Meg ! " she said . " I 'm learning the I Ching ! " " Is that all you have to do ? " " Well , we should use yarrow stalks but we do n't know what they are . " " I just want to tell you this , " Meg said . " I blame you as much as him . " " What , Meggie dear ? " " The two of you are as closed as a unit can get , I do n't care what he says . " " Closed ? What ? " said Justine , looking bewildered . Shep173rase , holding out two spaghetti whiskbrooms . " Wait , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was gone . She ran across the hall and out of the house . There was no sign of Arthur or Duncan in the yard . Only the Ford , melting into the twilight , with a magazine page flapping in the space where the door should have been : WOULD N'T YOU REALLY RATHER HAVE A BUICK ? FOR THE POLK VALLEY CHURCH 'S April bazaar Justine wore her very best dress  --  an A-line shift that Duncan had bought her five years ago at a nearly-new sale . She pulled her hair into a sprout on top of her head , covered it over with her hat , and dabbed at her mouth with a pink Tangee lipstick from high school . On her feet she wore her black Mary Janes , on her arm a gypsy bracelet borrowed from the Blue Bottle . Generally speaking , she thought she looked very presentable . Because the car was in the body shop , Justine had to ask for a lift in Dorcas 's baby-blue Cadillac . And Ann-Campbell had to come along , jouncing in the back seat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women to eavesdrop . Justine liked Ann-Campbell . She was certain she was goingto lead a very interesting life . On the way to Polk Valley Dorcas talked about her ex-husband , Joe Pete , whom she had married and divorced three times now . Every time she married him she had a large church weddingall over again , with Ann-Campbell as flower girl in a floorlengthorgandy dress to cover the scabs , scars , scrapes , bruises ,  |p174and  Band-Aids on her bony knees . Lately relatives had stopped attending , and the gifts had thinned out . " But , " said Dorcas , " he 's still my first husband , is n't he ? I 've never been married to anybody else , and neither has he . Why ca n't I have a wedding like I choose ? " Justine did n't want to think about weddings . They remindedher of Meg . She was worried sick about Meg , who had become very quiet the last few weeks , and whenever she talked it over with Duncan he acted so cross and stubborn that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marry anyone she chose , a Congo chieftain if she cared to , but not a man whose only qualitywas harmlessness . " Maybe she loves him , " Justine said , but doubtfully . She tried to believe it . Whenever she saw Arthur she worked at being interested in him . She observed that he was kind-hearted , steady , polite . . . and then her mind would trail off to some other subject and she forgot he was there . She watched Meg , who appeared as placid as ever . But then Meg did n't show emotions , that was all . Of course she loved him or she would n't say she wanted to marry him . Oh , the things she had prepared herself for , when Meg was born ! Merely the fact of having a new person in the world implieda stream of unforeseen events endlessly branching and dividing . As Meg grew into her teens Justine was braced for long-haired suitors , LSD , shoplifting , pregnancy , revolutionists , firearms in the closet  --  anything , for her daughter 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't expected Arthur Milsom , exactly . " Thursday night Joe Pete calls up . Will you be at home a while ? ' Where would I go to ? On no alimony at all and six months behind in child support . And Joe Pete 's a rich man , Britt Texaco . Joe Pete , ' I told him , I said , all in the world that 's left for me to do tonight is read my November seventy-two Modern Movies , ' and he says , Fine , for I 'm bringing back your daughter and you owe me forty-eight ninety-five for my new emerald rug which she dribble-bleached with a gallon of Clorox . I wo n't charge for the Clorox , ' he says . Well and good , ' I tellp175him , you can take that up with the FBI when they haul you in for kidnap . ' I 'm no fool . " " When he brought me back he stayed all night , " said AnnCampbell . " It 's his English Leather aftershave , " said Dorcas . Justine laughed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flashing the afternoon sunlight off their chrome , and ladies were swarming in the front yard and spilling down the hill as far as the cemetery . " I want to get a hot dog , " Ann-Campbell said , " and you owe me a balloon from that time at the shopping center , and I need a caramel apple . If they have cotton candy , can I have some ? If they 're selling lemon sticks  --  " " Ann-Campbell , you promised me you would act nice now if I let you stay out of school today . " " In school we do this math , " Ann-Campbell told Justine . " Oh yes , " said Justine , who had disliked math . " If five mothers are fighting over ten blond wigs , how many does each of them get ? They want me to say two , but how can I be sure ? Maybe one wig 's ugly and nobody takes it . Maybe one mother 's stronger than the rest and she gets five . Or one 's got a head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Britt , you are sending a shooting sharp pain right down between my shoulder blades , " her mother told her . If Justine had had to choose what child would most likely he Duncan 's in all the world , she would have said Ann-Camphell . Never Meg . The bazaar was in the church basement , down a flight of linoleum steps . It took Justine 's eyes a minute to get used to the dimness . Then she saw rows of booths covered with crepe paper , and more ladies bustling around in pantsuits and varnishedhairdos . Justine hated pantsuits . Whenever she saw one she had an urge to tell the owner some scandalous fortune , loudly enough to be heard everywhere : " The father of your next-to-last baby has run off with a cigar-smoking redhead . "  |p176But  she kept her bright smile and waited , clutching her bag , until the woman in charge noticed she was there . Mrs. Edge 's pantsuit was pale aqua , Justine 's least favorite color . Oh , but she would have to get over this mood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 'm Justine Peck , " she said . " I promised to come tell fortunes . " " Mrs. Peck ? Why , I thought you would be darker . We 've heard such amazing things about you , dear . Now somewhere , let me see now . . . " Mrs. Edge led the way toward a card table . It was covered with a white cloth to which stars and crescent moons had been pinned . Justine followed and behind her came Dorcas , wobbling on her spike heels and humming . There was no telling where Ann-Campbell had got to . " Now dear , this is your cashbox . I 've laid a few dollar bills in for change . Is there anything else you 'll be wanting ? I do hope you wo n't be chilly . Perhaps you should have brought a wrap . " " Oh no , I 'll be fine , " said Justine , who was always burning up . " Why ! Here 's Mrs. Linthicum , our pastor 's wife . Mrs. Peck here is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , then you can start on me , " Mrs. Linthicum said . She was wearing a dress , and a little brown mushroom of a hat . She was a tall wispy woman with freckles seeping through her pink face powder . When she sat down in the folding chair she arrangedherself so graciously , smoothing her skirt beneath her and then patting her bosom as if to make certain it was there , that Justine felt an unexplainable rush of sorrow . She reached over without planning to and touched Mrs. Linthicum 's freckled hand . " Oh , is it the left palm you read ? " asked Mrs. Linthicum . " No , no , I do n't read palms , " said Justine , withdrawing her hand . But she could easily have read that one , with its lengthwise groove and the worn wedding ring no wider than a thread . She took out her cards and unwrapped them . " Why , how fascinating , " said Mrs. Linthicum.  | " Is there anything in particular you want to know ? " Jus-t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of . " Dorcas leaned closer , giving off waves of Tabu , while Justine laid the cards down very , very gently . Madame Olita used to snap them down , but that was before they had started f : lling apart . When these went , where would she get more ? She gazed into space , considering . " I 'm not afraid to hear , if it 's bad , " said Mrs. Linthicum . Justine pulled her eyes back to the cards . " Oh , it 's not bad , not at all , " she said . " You 're going to do just fine . " " I am ? " " You 'll continue to have money worries , but not serious ones . You should n't be so concerned about your children . They will turn out all right . No trips in sight . No illness . You have t rile friends and a loving husband . " " Well , of course , " said Mrs. Linthicum . " All in all it 's a very good life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her voice . " Anybody would be happy to have a formation like this one . " " Why , thank you very much , " said Mrs. Linthicum. .1 ' hen when the silence had stretched on a while she gave a little laugh and rose to pay her fee , pressing Justine 's palm briefly With her cool , wilted fingers . When she left , Justine gazed after her for so long that Dorcas waggled a hand in front of her face and said , " You in there ? " Then others came , woman after woman , giggling a little in front of their friends . " No tall dark strangers ? No ocean trips ? " Several young girls filed through , a little boy in a baseball suit , a man in platform heels , an old lady . Justine tried to pin her mind to what she was doing . This was how she attracted future clients , after all . " You will have a minor car accident , " she told one girl , relieved to see something concrete . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe not . " " Then what 's the point of all this ? " " I do n't know . "  | " To warn you to start driving slower , Miss ! " Dorcas cried . " Honestly , Justine ! Where are you today ? " Oh , beautiful Dorcas , with her watery silk dress showing dimpled knees and her jangling bracelets and creamy throat ! Her fortune altered from week to week . Which gave Justine a greater likelihood of error , but at least she enjoyed doing it . During a lull they captured Ann-Campbell , who was winningtoo many prizes anyway tossing nickels into ashtrays , and Justine read her cards . Ann-Campbell leaned over her with a cone of cotton candy , smelling of burnt sugar and money . " You 'll have to travel your whole life long to use up all the travel cards I 'm seeing , " Justine told her . " I know that . " Then Dorcas , who had learned palmistry in high school , examined Ann-Campbell 's little square hand  --  a mass . of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ travel too , " she said , " but I do n't know , Ann-Campbell gets carsick . Let me see yours , Justine . " Justine turned her palm up . Secretly she had become as addicted to the future as Alonzo Divich , now that life moved so quickly . " Oh , talk about travel ! " said Dorcas . " What do you see ? " " Lots of trips . Oh , well , there 's much too much to read here . You have an indecisive nature , there are lots of . . . but I 'm not too sure what this means . And then a frequent change in surroundings and tendency to  --  " " But is it a good palm ? " " I 'm telling you , Justine ! Of course it is , it 's just full of things . " " No , I mean  --  " Dorcas raised her head . " Oh well , it does n't matter , " Justine told her finally . She never did say what she had meant . She sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her lap , while beside her Ann-Campbell started firmly , grimly patting her arm with the hand that was n't holding the cotton candy.  |p179Duncan  looked up from polishing a Cinderella pastry cutter and found Justine staring at him through the plate glass window , directly beneath his hand-lettered sign , ANTIC TOOLS WANTED . She was wearing her fanciest church bazaar outfit and there was a chain of safety pins dangling from the tip of her left breast . When he waved she waved back , but she kept on standing there . He rose and came close to the glass , popping his mouth like a goldfish . She smiled . " Come in ! " he shouted . So she came , leaving the door swinging open behind her . " I was just passing , " she told him . " You want to hear about my movie ? " " Yes . " " I 'm going to buy a camera and walk around filming to one side of things , wherever the action is n't . Say there 's a touchdownat a football game , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other end of the field . If I see a purse-snatcher I 'll find someone reading a newspaper just to the right of the victim . " " What 's the point ? " Justine asked . " Point ? It 'll be the first realistic movie ever made . In true life you 're never focused on where the action is . Or not so often . Not so finely . " He stopped and looked at her . " Point ? " he said . " You do n't usually ask me that . " " Duncan , I wish I knew what we should be doing about Meg . " " Oh . School called . She cut all her afternoon classes , they said . Is she sick ? " " Why , I do n't know . I have n't been home . " " Every day this week she 's had a headache . " " See there ? No wonder I worry , " Justine said . " I ought to go look in on her . " But instead she sat down on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rid of for months . " I am forty and one-third years old , " she said . Duncan blew on the pastry cutter and started polishing it again . " Does n't it seem to you that things are going by very fast ? " " I have always thought everything moved too slowly , " he said . " But I know I 'm in the minority . "  | " How did we get here ? " But when Duncan looked up , she had her eyes fixed on the opposite wall as if she did n't want an answer . He set down his work and rose to walk around the shop , passing his rows of polished tools and utensils . They did his heart good . He ignored what Silas had brought in from his tours of the auction sales  --  the china and scrolled furniture , which he allowed to pile up in dim corners . He paused beside a **25;3439;TOOLONG scale and laid his hand upon it gradually , delightingin its intricate , precise design . Behind him he heard the familiar plop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be asking , all alone ? But when he turned he saw that she was laying the I cards absent-mindedly , the way another person might doodle or chew a pencil . Her eyes were on something far away ; she smoothed each card blindly as she set it on the sewing chest beside her . While he watched , she frowned and collected her thoughts . She looked down at what she had laid out . " Why , Duncan , " she said . " What is it ? " " Why  --  " " What is it , Justine ? " " Never mind , do n't worry . Do n't worry . " " Who says I 'm worried ? " But she was already out the door , running down the street with her hat streamers fluttering . It was the first time Duncan had ever known her to leave her cards behind . Daniel Peck was on the front porch , rearranging a sheaf of correspondence , when Justine came dashing up the walk between the rows of sprouting vegetables . She looked wild-eyed and flustered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she called , " have you seen Meg ? " He tried to think . " Meg . " " Well , now I wonder where she could be , " he said . " What time is it ? "  |p181He  fumbled in his pocket and hauled out lengths of gold chain hand over hand , raising his eyebrows when his fingers met up with a watch . " Ah ! Five twelve , " he said . She spun past him , into the house , clattering the screen door behind her . He felt the noise rather than heard it . He felt his hones jar . Then there was peace , and he returned to a letter dated April Io , 1973 . He squinted in the twilight at a ragged blue script . Dear Mr. Peck : In response to your query of March 17 , I am sorry to say that I do not recall my grandmother 's ever mentioning a Caleb Peck or , for that matter , any other young man she used to dance with . I was not aware that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John M. ) of Duluth , Minnesota may know more . I myself was never at all close to my grandmotherand am certainly not the one to .. . He sighed . Long white fingers entered his vision , fluttering anotherletter on top of the first . Dear Mama , I have gone to he married in Arthur 's church . We will be living with Arthur 's mother . Do n't worry about me , I 'll finish school in Semple . I will keep in touch . Love , Meg " Eh ? What 's this ? " he asked Justine . She merely lifted an arm and dropped it , as if she could n't speak . " Why , " he said , " I did n't know it was proper for ministers to elope . " Justine went down the porch steps , back through the vegetablestoward the street , drifting along slower than he had seen her in years . " Justine ? Was n't that fellow a minister ? " She did n't answer . In the end he simply filed the letter away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been doing before.  |p182BY  MAY the whole front yard was a tangle of cucumber vines and little green stalks of corn . Neighbors began knocking on the door . " Justine , of course it 's your lawn to plant as you please although frankly it seems . . but never mind , what is that smell ? What we want to know is , that smell ! " " Oh , just things from the blender . " " The  --  ? When you turn down this street it 's the first thing you notice . It smells like a zoo . A city dump . A slaughterhouse . " " I 'll mention it to Duncan , " Justine said . But her face was lit up and her eyes all curly , she was so happy to see somebody . She would reach out to touch visitors on the wrist or shoulder , drawing them in . " Since you 're here , why do n't you stay ? " " Oh , well ... " " We can sit out back . You wo n't smell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a minute . " " I 'll make you lemonade , or coffee . Anything . What would you like ? " The fact was , Justine hated to be alone . She had felt so restless and unhappy lately , wandering from room to room , trying to start up conversations with her grandfather when he was too busy with his own thoughts to answer . " Grandfather , is n't there any place you 'd like to go ? " " How 's that ? " " Do you want to go somewhere , I said . " " No , no . " She sank back and twisted a piece of her hair . It was impossible to drive off on her own ; a car was so private . Like a sealed black box . She would end up speeding just to get her isolation over with , or she would run a stop sign because even horns and curses were better than silence . So instead of driving she walked to Duncan 's shop , missing no opportunity to speak to passers-by . " Hello , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would ?  |p183Where  's Mrs. Hill ? Wait , Red Emma , I 'll walk along with you , " and she would run to catch up and travel three blocks out of her way , pausing at each house while Red Emma delivered the mail . She parted from people with difficulty , dragging it out , loitering on the sidewalk fiddling with a button and finding new things to say to them . She dreaded walking even half a block with only her own thoughts for company . And when finally she arrived at the Blue Bottle she would be full of pent-up words that explodedfrom her before she was fully in the door . " Duncan , Red ; coma told me . . . Bertha Millar asked . . . oh , Duncan , I just had a thought , can we borrow a wayward girl from the police station ? " " A what 's that ? " " Surely they must have some , would n't you think ? We could leave our name and the next time the police arrest somebody they could bring her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Well now , wait a minute . " But she would be off to something new , picking up merchandiseand putting it down . " Oh look , a locket like Aunt Bea 's almost . And Aunt Sarah 's dinner ring but the stone 's a different color . Is n't it funny they call these antiques ? They 're only what our aunts wear every day of their lives . What 's this thing , Dun-can ? " " A Victorian slide pendant , " Duncan said glumly . " If you ask me , it 's junk . All this stuff is junk . Yesterday Silas brought in a whole carton full , he 'd been to some flea market . Here , take this , ' he said , and get rid of that mess on the table , it does n't look nice . ' Do you know what he called mess ? A genuine chromatrope I bought from old Mrs. Milhauser , and a Boston bathing pan with a pump that still works . . . where is it now ? I wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or other . He does n't like tools and things with moving parts , he says they clutter the shop . We spend all our time shifting each other 's merchandise into hiding places and out again , in and out . Look at that chair ! He likes it . He wants me to ask a hundred and fifty dollars for it . " Justine looked at a chair with a curved spine that was allp184pointed leaves and flowers and little sharp berries . On one of its finials Duncan had impaled a liniment ad . " I 've a good mind to quit this job , " he said , but she did n't bother answering that . He would never quit in the middle of a fight . She wanted him to come with her somewhere . " Maybe we could take a trip , " she told him . " All right . " " Just spur of the moment . " " All right . " " We might even stop and see Meg . " But then his face grew cold and stubborn . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Justine . " " But she said . She said in her letters . " " We 'll have you over sometime soon , ' is what she said . Pay attention . " He knew Meg 's letters by heart , the same as Justine . It was all an act , his unconcern . ( " Duncan , " she had told him , " Meg has gone to marry Alfred , I mean Arthur , " and he had grown motionless for one split second before continuing to close up shop . ) " As long as we do n't come for a meal , " she said now , " why do we have to wait to be invited ? " " We 're not going till we are , I tell you . " " Oh , that 's ridiculous . She 's our daughter . " " So what ? " " Remember when she was colicky , all those evenings you walked up and down with Meggie on your shoulder ? You sang Blues in the Night . ' Her head was straight up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying not to miss a word . " " Merely singing Blues in the Night ' to someone does not obligate me to pay them an uninvited visit seventeen years later . " " Eighteen , " said Justine . " Eighteen . " " You used to take her to the circus when she was too little to hold down a spring-up seat . For three straight hours you leaned on it for her so she would n't pop right up again . " " There was an intermission. "  | " Even so . " " Merely leaning on a spring-up seat for someone  --  " " And she 's not just someone . She 's not just any old personthat you would treat so formally the minute she hurt your feel-ings . " " Who 's hurt ? " Duncan said . ' " Look at Grandfather . Do you know what I found him dointthe other day ? He was at the kitchen table all hunched overit h his head in his hands . I thought something was wrong . I lien he sat up and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Hammond atlas . Not Maryland , not the United States , the ' world , Duncan . That 's how far he let Caleb run before he would/go after him . Are we going to do that too ? ' J " We 're never going to forget that man , are we , " DuncanP %aid . " The one that got away . " He set down a crimping iron . " I lowever , we 're wandering off the subject here . Meg has not vanished . We know exactly where she is . She writes us a letter once a week . All I 'm saying is do n't repeat history , give her a little breathing space . Let her ask us first . " " Oh , there 's always some excuse . " " I 'm just telling you what I think . " " Do you wish I had n't come after you , when you left honk ? " rF " No . " " Well , I wish it sometimes , Duncan Peck . " " No doubt you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walk off again , you realize I wo n't follow . HI have them declare you legally dead , I 'll remarry right away . " " Of course , " he said serenely . There was no way to win a fight with that man . She stormed out of the shop and then stood on the sidewalk , wondering what to do with herself . Everything seemed Irritating . The sunlight was too sharp for her eyes . The trafficas too noisy , a swarm of gigantic glaring station wagons . She hated the way the women drivers were poised at the Main Street traffic light , all lifting their arms simultaneously to orchestrate their hairdos . She turned in the other direction , toward home ,  |p186which  was not where she wanted to be but she could n't think of any place else . In the kitchen , her grandfather was washing the dishes . Periodically he had these spells of trying to make the house look cared for . He wore around his waist a striped linen dishtowelwith an enormous charred hole in its center . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , doggedly scrubbing a saucepan with a piece of dried gourd that Duncan had grown two years ago after reading about its scouring properties . The gourd looked like a chunk of hardened beige seaweed . From time to time he stopped scrubbing and examined it , frowning , as if he found it difficult to believe . Then he rinsed the saucepan and plodded over to the table with it , head bowed , shoulders hunched . " Hello , Grandfather , " Justine said . " Grandfather ? " He started and looked up . " Eh ? " " You do n't have to wash the dishes . " " I 'd like to know what we 'd eat off tonight if I did n't . " " We could always go to the diner , " Justine said . " Ha . " He dried the saucepan on a corner of his apron . Then he set it on a stack of meticulously cleaned , polished plates and trudged back to the sink . He was so stooped that , from behind , his head seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the elastic X of his suspenders in the hollow of his spine , and his trousers draped and formless as if he had no seat . Nowadays , everywhere Justine looked she found something to make her sad . She would have liked to write Meg another letter , but she had sent one just this morning . So she went instead to Meg 's bedroom , to open her closet and stare at the row of shirtdresses that seemed to be leading a gentle muted life of their own . Someday soon , Meg said in her letters , she would stop by for the rest of her things or her parents could bring them when they came to visit . But Justine felt comforted by what was left behind and she would be sorry to see the room stripped . She took a deep breath of Meg 's clean smell : Ivory soap and fresh-ironed fabric . She stroked the collar of the nearest dress , with its precise top/stitching , and then she lifted the cover of the sewing machine to admire Meg 's mastery of such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawers , but Meg was particular about her privacy . When Meg was a baby , Justine had realized for the first time that it was possible to die . She had felt suddenly fragile underthe responsibility of staying alive to raise her daughter . ( In those days , she expected to do it perfectly ; she thought no one else could manage . ) She developed a fear of fire that was so unfounded she could n't even tell Duncan because of course he would laugh at her . Over and over again she imagined the salty smell of smoke in the air , or a flickering red glow reflected on the wall . If Duncan were home he could get them out of anything , but what if it happened in the daytime while he was at work ? By herself she was so young and skinny and incompetent . Then gradually , she developed an escape plan . They were living in Uncle Ed Hodges 's garage apartment at the time . If fire broke out she could snatch up the baby , climb out on the kitchen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the roof of Uncle Ed 's back porch . Once she had pictured all this she relaxed , and eventually she forgot her fear completely . It was not till years later , returning to Uncle Ed 's for a visit , that she saw that such a leap would have been insane . It was not only too far , it was also upward . She would have had to soar through the air like some surrealistic figure in a painting by Chagall , feet set neatly together and arms primly clasping the baby . But in those days , she might have managed anything . She was so necessary . Even when Meg had left infancy , given up first Justine 's breast and then her lap and finally gone to play in other rooms altogether , Justine had to be there . She had to be the feeder , the fixer , the sounding board for an endless stream of announcements . " Mama my dress is dirty , Sammy hit me , the violets are out . Mama there 's a spider in my chocolate milk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the windowscreen . My stomach aches . My mosquito bites itch . Janie has a hamster , Edwin 's in the asparagus , I broke the handle off my teapot , Melissa has a music box you can watch right through the glass . " Justine nodded , barelyp188listening ; the only answer required was , " Yes , dear . " Then Meg was satisfied , as if things came into existence only when she was certain her mother knew about them . And now what ? Justine had raised her daughter without dying after all ; she was freed from her fears . But at night she woke up shaky and sad , and she pressed her face against Duncan 's chest and said , " I 'm not necessary any more . " " To me you are , " he said . He did n't see what she meant . He had n't had that feeling of being essential to Meg in the first place ; he could n't know how it felt to lose it . She wandered to other rooms , to hers and Duncan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hall where she tripped over a stack of lumber . Everything looked dusty and stale . She hung out the living room window to be revived by AnnCampbell , who was taunting a playmate among the cucumber vines : Little boy your teeth are greenAnd your tongue it is rotting away . Better gargle with some gasoline , Brush with Comet and vomit today . She returned to the kitchen , feeling more cheerful . " Grandfather , let 's take a trip , " she said . " A what ? " " A trip . " " But we do n't have any leads right now , Justine . " " Why wait for leads ? Oh , why wo n't anyone do anything ? Are we just going to sit here ? Am I going to get rooted to the living room couch ? " Her grandfather watched her , with his eyes wide and blan and his hands endlessly drying an Exxon coffee mug on the corner of his apron . Justine took her grandfather to an afternoon concert in Palm field , although she did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear it . The two of them sat rigid in theirp189seats , directing unblinking blue stares toward the outline of a set of car keys in the violin soloist 's trouser pocket . Then they went home by bus with Justine as dissatisfied as ever , bored and melancholy . Each time strangers rose to leave she mourned them . Who knew in what way they might have affected her life ? She took Duncan , her grandfather , and Ann-Campbell Britt an the funeral of a chihuahua belonging to an old lady client . " I That is this ? Where are we going ? " her grandfather kept asking . " Do n't worry , just come , " said Justine . " Why do you cart ? Just grab up your hearing aid and come , Grandfather . If yon want things to happen you have to run a few blind errands , you know . " So he came , grumbling , and they sat on folding chairs in a cow pasture that had recently been turned into a pets ' memorial garden . " The casket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Duncan . " It 's all metal . But they could have settled for wood : thirty-two ninety-eight . Mrs. BazIcytold me . She selected the hymns herself . The minister is fully ordained . " " Oh , excellent , " said Duncan , " I wonder if he needs an assistant , " and after the service he went up and offered Arthur Milsom 's address to the minister . But Grandfather Peck wanderedamong the wreaths and urns looking baffled . Why had he been brought here ? Justine could no longer tell him . She rode home beside Duncan without a word , swinging one foot and rapidly chewing coffee beans that she had taken to keeping in a tin container at the bottom of her bag . On Sundays she drove her grandfather to Plankhurst for Quaker meeting , which used to be something she tried to get nut of because she did n't like sitting still so long . Now she would go anywhere . Grandfather Peck was not , of course , a Quaker and had no intention of becoming one , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't speak up . It made him feel left out , he said . Even the Quakers would sometimes take it into their heads to rise and mumble , perversely keeping their faces turned away so that he could n't read their lips . Then he whispered , " What ? What ? "  --  a harsh sound sawing through the air . He made Justine write everythingp190down for him on a 3 X 5 memo pad he kept in his breast pocket . Justine would click the retractable point of his ballpoint pen in and out , in and out , waiting for a five-minute speech to be over , and then she wrote , " He says that God must have made even Nixon , " or " Peace is not possible as long as neighbors can still argue over a lawn mower . " " That took him five minutes ? " " Ssh . " " But what was he up there working his mouth all that time for ? " " Ssh , Grandfather . Later . " " You must have left something out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pen and pad , and sigh , and check the Seth Thomas clock on the mantel and run her eyes once more down the rows of straight-backed radiant adults and fidgetychildren lining the wooden benches . After twenty minutes the children were excused , rising like chirping , squeaking mice to follow the pied piper First-Day School teacher out of the room , breaking into a storm of whistles and shouts and stampingfeet before the door was properly shut again . She should have gone with them , she always thought . The silence that followedwas deep enough to drown in . She would plow desperatelythrough her straw bag , rustling and jingling , coming up finally with her tin container of coffee beans . When she bit into them , she filled the meetinghouse with the smell of breakfast . Once her grandfather wrote on the pad himself , several lines of hurried spiky handwriting that he passed to her . " Read this out when no one else is talking , " he whispered . She struggled to her feet , hanging onto her hat . Anything to break the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said . " I used to think that heaven was  --  palatable ? Palatial . I was told it had pearly gates and was paved with gold . But now I hope they are wrong about that . I would prefer to find that heaven was a small town with a bandstand in the park and a great many trees , and I would know everybody in it and none of them would ever die or move away or age or alter . ' "  |p191She  sat down and gave him back the memo pad . She took the top off her coffee beans but then she put it on again , and kept the container cupped in her hands while she gazed steadily out the window into the sunlit trees. one afternoon toward the end of May the doorbell rang and Justine , flying to answer it , found Alonzo Divich standing on t Ile porch . Although it was hot he wore a very woolly sheepskin vest . He carried a cowboy hat , swinging by a soiled string . " Alonzo ! " Justine said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he told her . " Oh no . Come in . " He followed her into the hall , shaking the floor with each step . Grandfather Peck was on the living room couch writing a letter to his daughters . " Do n't get up , " Alonzo called to him , although the grandfather was still firmly seated , giving him that stare of shocked disbelief he always wore for Alonzo . " How 's the heart , eh ? " Alonzo asked . " How 's the heart ? " " Hearth ? " " Nothing 's wrong with his heart , " said Justine . " Come into the kitchen , Alonzo , if you want your cards read . You know I ca n't do it right with Grandfather watching . " While she cleared the remains of breakfast from the table , Alonzo wandered around the kitchen examining things and whistling . " Your calendar is two months ahead , " he told Justine . " Is it ? " " Most people 's would be behind . " " Yes , well . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When she returned Alonzo was standing at the open refrigerator , looking into a bowl of moldy strawberries . " How is my friend Duncan ? " he asked her . " He 's fine . " " Maybe I 'll drop by and see him . Is Meg out of school yet ? " " She 's married . " " Married . "  | " She eloped with that minister . " " I 'm sorry , Justine . " He shut the refrigerator and sat down at the table to watch her shuffle the cards . He looked tired and hot , and the grooves alongside his mustache were silvered with sweat . A disk with Arabic lettering gleamed in the opening of his shirt . Last time it had been a turquoise cross . She did n't ask why ; he would n't have answered . " Alonzo , " was all she said , " you have no idea how it gladdens my heart to see you . Cut , please . " He cut the cards . She laid them out , one by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she asked . Alonzo said , " You realize , last time I took your advice . " " You did ? " " When you told me not to sell the business . " " Oh yes . Well , I should hope so , " said Justine . " It was the first time you ever said to keep on with something I was already doing . " She stopped swinging her foot . " But I was tempted to disobey you anyway , " he told her . " I admit . I went to see my friend , the one in merchandising . He has these clients , you understand , department stores and such , they come to him for ideas on . . . but anyway . I said I might join up with him . Oh , fine , ' he tells me . But then he starts suggestingI wear a different style of clothes . Well , that I can follow . I am practical , I know how the world works . But he does n't see , he 's still trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he says , we all have to give in in little ways . Look at me . I 'm a tall man , ' he says . And he is , a fine tall man . Well , ' he says , when important clients come , know what I do ? I try to stay seated as much as possible , and if I stand I kind of squinch down . I do n't stoop , ' he says , that 's too obvious . Just bend at the knees a little . Understand , it 's not something I think of so consciously . But you can see a client , important fellow like that , he would n't feel right if I was to tower over him . You got to keep a watch for such things , Alonzo . ' " He shook his head , and pulled his great silver belt buckle around to where it would n't cut into his stomach so.  | " Justine , " he said , " do you know that I have never before dime what you told me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said . " I mean it . You 're always right , but only because I go against instructions and things turn out badly just the way you said they would . Now I discover things turn out badly anyhow . Is that your secret ? I 've found it , ha ? You give people advice they 'll be sure not to follow . Right ? " She laughed . " No , Alonzo , " she said . " And I 'm glad you did n't sell the carnival . Whatever 's gone wrong . " " My mechanic 's been arrested . " " Lem ? " " He robbed a bank in nineteen sixty-nine . They say . " " Oh , I see . " " Now , here 's what I want to know . Is he coming back , or not ? I mean if he 's coming soon I 'll hold the machines together somehow and wait it out , but if he 's guilty , on the other hand  --  " " Well , I do n't think I 'm supposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Look here ! What do I care about guilt ? All they lost was two hundred dollars , let him keep it . Besides a little matter of a shooting . I want to know about my business . I want to know if I should just give up , because to tell the truth this fellow Lem was a man I relied on . He saw to everything . Now , merchandisingis out but there is always something else , and the jodhpur lady still wants my carnival . Shall I sell , after all ? Is the man gone forever ? " Justine frowned at a card . " You see what I 've fallen to , " Alonzo said . " I used to ask about beautiful women . Now it 's financial matters . " " Well , Lem is not coming back , " said Justine . " I knew it . " " But you should n't sell the carnival . " " How can you keep saying such a stupid thing ? " " Do n't argue with me , argue with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've turned up every jack in the deck , you 'll have all the mechanics you want . "  | " Oh , of course , " Alonzo said . " One after the other . The first one drinks , the second leaves with my ponies  --  " " And look at the women ! Look , Alonzo , you 're not paying attention . See ? Here you are , the king of hearts . And here 's the queen of hearts , the queen of clubs , the queen of diamonds . . . " Alonzo sat forward , peering at the cards , resting his hand upon his knees . " Here is the good luck card , the card of friendship , the celebration card . . . " " All right , all right ! " Alonzo said . She sat back and smiled at him . " Oh , Justine , " he told her sadly , " sometimes I think I would like to go live in a cabin in the woods , all alone . I 'd take a lifetime supply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhapssome books . Do you know I 've never read an entire book ? Just the good parts . I think about hibernating like a bear , just eating and drinking and sleeping . No tax , insurance , electric bills , alimony , repairs or repainting or Rustoleum , no women to mess up my life , no one shooting bank guards , no children . Then here you come galloping along in your terrible hat and your two sharp hipbones like pebbles in your pockets and you tell me all these things I may expect , a life full of surprises . How can I refuse ? I feel curious all over again , I like to know what will happennext . " And he shook his head , stroking downward on his mustache , but he did not look so tired as when he had arrived . All his tiredness seemed to have passed to Justine , who sat slumped in her chair with her hands limp on the cards . Duncan and Justine were on the front steps , watching the firefliesspark all around them . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " What 's a garden engine ? " " It 's this big wheeled thing to spray water on your flowers . What a relief ! I bought it with my own money in a moment of weakness . I kept it sitting in the back room ; I had to open the double doors to get it in and then I was afraid it would go rightp195through the floorboards . A man named Newton Norton bought it . He 's just started reconstructing this old-time farmhouse out in the country . " " Well , that 's nice , " said Justine . " He also bought some fuller 's shears , and all my carpentry tools . " " That 's nice . " He looked over at her . " When I went into Meg 's room , " she said , " and found her note telling me she 'd gone , I never read anything that hurt so . But then I looked up , and there I was reflected in the window that was just starting to go dark outside . There were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought , My , do n't I look interesting ? Like someone who has had something dramatic happen . ' I thought that ! " She laid her face against Duncan 's sleeve . Duncan put his arm around her and pulled her closer , but he did n't say anything . Lucy PECK had to ride in the suicide seat , beside her husband Two , who was driving . Laura May and Sarah got to sit in back . Lucy had to put up with the hot air rushing in Two 's open window and Mantovani playing much too loudly on the radio . She had to say what roads to take when she could n't even fold a map right , much less read it . " Now the next thing is you 're going to turn left , about a quarter-inch after Seven Stone Road . Or , I do n't know . What would a little bitty broken blue line seem to mean ? " Her husband set his front teeth together very ,  |p196very  delicately , not a good sign at all . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cry out and fling her road map into the air . And meanwhile there sat Laura May and Sarah , protected by layered hats with brown veils , contemplating two separate views peacefully like children being taken for a drive . It was the sixth of June and they were on their way to Caro Mill , Maryland , to celebrate their father 's ninety-third birthday . Unfortunately his birthday fell on a Wednesday this year , which meant that no one who worked could come along . And Bea was confined to her bed with lower back pain . It was up to them : Lucy and the maiden aunts , and Two , who was now retired . Between them they had loaded the car with presents and fruit , a Thermos of Sanka , Laura May 's needlework , Sarah 's knitting , insect repellent , sunscreen , Bufferin , Gelusil , a Triple-A tour guide , a can of Fix-a-Flat , a fire extinguisher , six emergencyflares , and a white banner reading SEND HELP . They had had the Texaco man check the gas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressure , and windshield cleaner . Then Two nosed the car out into traffic and they were on their way , with enough horns honking behind them to remind Lucy of an orchestra tuning up . Young people nowadays were so impatient . Luckily Two was not a man who could be fussed , and he went on driving at his same stately tempo . In his old age he had shrunk somewhat , and was made to seem even smaller by his habit of tipping his head back as he peered through the windshield . His eyes were narrow blue hyphens . His mouth was pulled downward by two ropes in his neck . When he decided to turn left from the right-hand lane he signaled imperiously out the window , still facing front , maintaining his cool Apache profile for Lucy to marvel at while behind them more horns honked . " Kindly check the odometer , Lucy , " was all he said . " I would be interested in knowing our mileage on this trip . " " Yes , dear . " Once they hit the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too wide an expanse of fields . It was sonic time since they had been in the country . ( One year ago today , to be exact . ) Lucy longed for her wing chair in which she couldp197sir encircled , almost , with the wings working like a mule 's Flinders to confine her gaze to the latest historical romance . The upholstery was embroidered in satin-stitch , which she loved to stroke absently as she read . Then in the back yard her Sea Foam roses were just opening ; there were going to be more this year than ever before and she was missing one entire day 's worth . And it was so much cooler and greener at home , so shadowy , so thickly treed that when you spoke outdoors your voice came echoing back , clear and close , as if reflected from a vaulted green ceiling not far above your head . Here the sun turned everything pale . Pinkish barns sped past and bleached gray roadbanks , and beige creeks spanned by wooden bridges like driedtip , whitening bones . Lucy turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes reluctantly drawn to hers . " Really , traveling makes me sad , " Lucy told them . But they did n't answer ( Lucy always said such personal things ) , so she faced front again . At Plankhurst there was a very confusing crossroads and , she sent Two thirteen miles out of the way before the mistake was realized . " Oh , I 'm just so  --  I just ca n't tell you how badly I feel about this , " she said . Two grunted . In the back seat her sisters-in-law gave her disappointed looks that made her want to cry . " I just seem to do everything wrong , " she said . Nobody denied it . Two hours out of Baltimore they began to encounter signs for Caro Mill , although still it seemed they were in the depths of the country . The only buildings were farmhouses , widely scattered , and occasionally a little grocery store patched with soft drink ads . Then they swooped over a hill and there was the town all spread out before them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this Main Street annually for years , although e.ich time in a different location . They had passed this very Woolworth 's , diner , pizza parlor , fabric store displaying dingy belts of cloth turning gray along the creases . Still , Lucy sat up straighter and began perking the lace at the neck of her dress . I wo pressed his thin white hair flat against his head , and in back there were rustles and whispers . " Oh , I do hope Father
