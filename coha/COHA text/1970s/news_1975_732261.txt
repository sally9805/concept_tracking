txt Letters to the Editor pg . 46 Letters to the Editor Commuters : Overtaxed and To the Editor : Mayor Beame 's recent call for tripling the commuter tax is now being echoed by others throughout the city . I fully expect to hear more of the same . I commute into this glorious city from the suburbs , where I pay more taxes for fewer services than does the average resident of New York City . Overtaxed and underserved , I am now being asked to shoulder an additional tax burden to support services for city residents which I do not have at home . I see no reason to pay for free garbage collection for private homes and apartments when I pay for it as a suburban homeowner . I further see no reason for me to have to support the city 's free university system since neither myself nor my children can ever obtain its benefits . I frankly can not understand how commuters do anything but increase the city 's tax take . We travel to New York either by car or by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support . The roads in Manhattan are as necessary for city residents as they are for out-of-towners , and costs for these roads would be there without us . The city does not supply free parking for us or really give up anything in the way of services which justifies even the present commuter tax . It seems to me that commuters do nothing but bring money into the city Of Homes and Taxes To the Editor : On Nov. 29 you published a letter from Mortimer Altin of Freeport , L. I. , deploring the fact that New York City residents pay such low real-estate taxes compared to residents of the suburbs . He ended his letter by asking , " Is it unreasonable to ask the owner of a $50,000 home to pay $100 to $200 per month in taxes in these times ? " My wife and I are the owners of a house in Manhattan that is currently assessed at $48,000 , and we pay $327.48 per month in taxes , so Mr. Altin 's suggestion seems fine to us . I just wanted you and Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offer . PAUL . H. BONNER New York , Dec. 1 , 1975 ? Concorde : No Help To the Editor : The recent letter by Claude MosseriMarlio of St. Louis advocating the Concorde SST as a boon to business in New York City shows a lack of understanding of both the aircraft and the economics involved . The main selling point of the Concorde ( which carries 98 passengers and practically no cargo ) is that a businessman can come to New York , conduct his business and return home within 24 hours . Therefore , our businessman needs no hotel room and has no time to shop , see a show or eat more than one meal off the plane . In short , Concorde will do nothing for New York 's economy other than hurt it . It will also siphon business from American carriers , namely Pan Am and T.W.A. In addition , with the To the Editor : Whatever happened to the charge of profiteering ? Once upon a time , specifically in World War II and even more vociferously in World War I , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examples of prices patently in excess of manufacture and merchandising costs after due allowance for wartime inflation . In 1919 and in 1946 the business community seems to have been sensitive to the charge of gouging , and prices thereafter tended to stabilize . But now ? A stopper for the bathtub retails at 35 cents ; pipe cleaners at 35 cents ; neither item can escape inflation , but they still cost about 3 cents to manufacture . Sugar was astronomically high in the spring of this year , and coffee currently is following in the footsteps of sugar . Neither the earlier price of sugar nor the current price of coffee reflects actual **29;768;TOOLONG costs . The proof of this is in the precipitous drop in the retail price of sugar since early spring ; and in the case of coffee , the rise in price is too great to reflect properly any increase in production cost . Bathtub stoppers , pipe cleaners , sugar , coffee and a host of other items have been , and many still are , overpriced with respect to initial cost plus marketing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ otherwise would n't be here . They occupy high-rise structures which raise the value of prime land and add substantially and significantly to the city real-estate tax revenues . I find it hard to believe that the amount collected in real-estate taxes by the city for these structures , together with sales taxes from commuters , does not more than pay for the extra fire and police protection along with that portion of public transportation properly allocable to commuters . I have never seen one article in this newspaper or elsewhere analyzing the cost to the city for commuters as against the financial benefit derived . Commuters make up only a small percentage of the daytime population of the city . We seem to be the embattled minority , too diverse to unite and demand that someone put together the facts and figures and publish them . I would have no objection to kicking in more dollars to the city treasury if someone will be good enough to show me in black and white that I am not more than paying my way now . Many of us want to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that this can not be done by political rhetoric or by unthinking policy endorsements by the Editorial Board of The New York Times . KENNETH J.

To Enjoy TV Concerts To the Editor : I read with interest the news concerning Lincoln Center 's plan to televise musical events . The idea is commendable , but there is a serious drawback . The audio capability of the average TV receiver is decidedly inferior . I for one would not care to listen to muffled music emanating from my four-inch TV speaker . A plan to simulcast these productions using accompanying FM channels should be developed in order to make this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York , Dec. 1 , 1975 been added indiscriminately with the result that profiteering goes on unknown to the buying public . The term is apparently out of date and avoided by the press and radio/ TV . The practice is not new , however , and the newspapers , TV and radio would do their readers and listeners a service were they to identify it by name whenever the occasion warrants . The coffee purveyors are indulging in a spurt of profiteering right now . Ironically , there are coupons worth 50 cents per six-ounce bottle still extant for a name-brand instant coffee , which is a barefaced admission that the shelf price is grotesquely high . As in the case of sugar , when newspaper articles exploded the myth of the health and nutrient values of " at table " sugar , the coffee addicts will reduce their intake spurred by the inordinate increase in price , even though this may be more of a sacrifice because coffee drinkers are " hooked .

Meanwhile , the lowly buying public is entitled to the satisfaction of having it called " like it is . " F. J. CLARK New York , Nov , 20 , 1975 Solzhenitsyn 's ' Sermon ' To the Editor : I was saddened by Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn 's political sermon on the Dec. 1 Op-Ed page . His place in hietory was challenged when the Soviet authorities expelled him from Russia . Does he have to play into their hands by drifting from literature , human rights and other related issues to domestic American politics ? His story is clumsy . His comparison of the pain he felt when President Kennedy was killed to his feelings about Secretary Schlesinger 's dismissal sounds hollow . His not very subtle suggestion that American judicial authorities covered up the assassins .. tion appears to be rather a cheap shot . His political advice that the President should have cleared Schles , - inger 's dismissal with our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tions directed at the Secretary of State . are lacking taste and class . Why does he do it ? Is Solzhenitsyn.  --  a literary idol of so many , a genius with words and human feelings ? an . unstable individual seeking a similarpolitical role in exile that he played . in the Soviet Union ? Does he want to , be a dissident first and a writer .. second ? Or , deprived of his pivotal ? role in his native country , is he trying to do in Zurich what he was doing so well in Moscow ? It is always sad when one observes a destruction of monuments and syni- ' , bols . The sadness is compounded , when it is a self-destructive act per- , formed in full view of admirers and critics . The critics have every reason to rejoice , the admirers to turn around and depart hiding their disappoint- " ment . ZYGMUNT NAGORSKI " . New York , Dec. 1 , 1975 ? The Reagan Record To the Editor : About your Nov. 20 editorial assess : ' ment of Ronald @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In reporting the increase in the state budget and taxes generally , yoni neglected to mention the increase inflation during those same years and . ' the role of a Democratic Legislature- . Actually , if one looks at all the fact ? ' ? during Reagan 's governership , a con- : elusion quite different from that of " The Times emerges . Reagan held state " employment to a 10 percent increase , as compared to a 75 percent increase in the administration of Reagan 's predecessor , Edmund Brown . Welfare reform tightened eligibility rules ; benefits for people with jobs were reduced ; fraud was prosecuted ; able-bodied people were put to work ' on community projects . The result : a $1-billion decrease in welfare costs . And you failed to mention the most significant fact of all : Reagan left office with a $500-million surplus . That is something for New Yorkers to think about . There is no discrepancy- ; between " the Reagan rhetoric and the , Reagan record .

In Madison 's Honor To the Editor : As chairman of the congressionally created James Madison Memorial Commission , I have been dismayed and . alarmed at the press reports that cerr : tain members of the House of Repre-. sentatives are once again trying to ' , take over the Library of Congress. ; James Madison Memorial Building as a , House office building . Years of plan. - ning and millions of dollars have been spent on making this building a library . building with a suitable Madison ? Memorial Hall . A number of years ago , ' our commission , which was charged with recommending the creation of a Madison memorial , decided that it did not want just a marble statue but a living memorial to the Father of the Constitution . As Madison was the first to propose a library for the use of Congress , our commission joined forces with the Library of Congress , which even then was in dire need of space , and Congress authorized a combined memorial and library building on its present site . The House of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any attempt to get it by seizing the Madison Building . It would he wasteful , in both time and money , be- , cause the interior of the building would have to be redesigned and rebuilt to those specifications , but meantime the priceless collections of the Library of , Congress would he endangered from lack of adequate housing and the ser/- , , ices further crippled by the space , squeeze under which it has existed for the last decade . I hope that as we approach our. , Bicentennial year , all citizens , and their representatives in the House of Representatives , will realize that this , Library of Congress monument to our heritage should not be diverted from its intended use .
