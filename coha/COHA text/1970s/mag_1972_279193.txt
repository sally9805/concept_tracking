Because open-heart surgery has a massive impact on the system , surgeons routinely keep close watch on the patient 's bodily functions during the postoperative period . Now , to hasten recovery , doctors are being urged to study their patients ' psyches as well , and for good reason . A Yale University School of Medicine researcher , Dr. Chase Patterson Kimball , has found that open-heart surgery sometimes produces severe psychological reactions . <P> Serious operations may leave psychological scars . Feelings of rage are common in women who have undergone hysterectomies ; depression is understandably frequent among those who lose a breast because of cancer . Open-heart surgery , reports Kimball , produces its own constellation of symptoms : temporary loss of memory and intellectual function , delusions and even life-threatening depression . <P> Painful Awakening . Kimball bases his findings on observations of more than 200 open-heart patients during the past six years . Of this number , at least 70% suffered some psychological aftereffect . A few became euphoric , assuming , sometimes incorrectly , that the successful surgery had solved all their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that neither the operation nor the care they were receiving would help . In some cases , there were lapses in the ability to read or speak . One 50-year-old man found himself unable to understand a simple sentence , or count backward from 100 . A 57-year-old patient became violent , shouting unintelligibly and attempting to rise from his bed and pull out his intravenous tubes . <P> The reasons for such reactions vary considerably . Oxygen deprivation during surgery , leading to identifiable brain disturbances , explains only a handful of cases . Many problems appear to be emotional in origin . Most patients go into such operations with anxiety , sometimes depression over both the risks and the results . Those who survive face a painful awakening when the anesthetic wears off . They come to in the hospital 's intensive care unit , surrounded by machinery to help them breathe and with tubes coming out of their noses , mouths and other orifices . Some resent this depersonalizing dependence upon technology and remain depressed until they are returned to their rooms . By contrast , others fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being pushed out of the nest , " said one patient . " You have to fly or ... " <P> Most patients , fortunately , succeed in flying , recovering physically within a few months after their operations . Some even develop amnesia where the operation 's emotional aftermath is concerned . Most , believes Kimball , could recover faster if they could be spared psychological upsets . His studies have shown that advance screening can identify those patients most likely to react badly to open-heart surgery . A complete description of what the patient can expect when he emerges from anesthesia , something few doctors now bother to give , could ease emotional anguish and make his recovery more rapid .
