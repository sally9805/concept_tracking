Mrs. Gandhi is not taking any chances : she is running in two constituencies at once , her " home " in Rae Bareli in Uttar Pradesh and in a " safe " constituency in Andhra Pradesh . At least one thing is certain : whatever the final outcome , Mrs. Gandhi will be in a stronger position after the elections than she is now , commanding only sixty or so of the 542 votes in Parliament . We can only hope that despite the drought and despite the three-way race , and despite the uninspiring Janata record , the people in the countryside and . in the hutnients of the cities will for a second time save India from its politicians . Yet even if the Janata Party or the Lok Dal separately , or together in some new expedient coalition , win enough votes to thwart Mrs. Gandhi again , the same aging figures and rivalries will continue to dominate Indian politics . And of course Mrs. Gandhi will continue to be active , gaining ever more legitimacy with each election she contests , skewing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obsessions . More than the rains are needed to end India 's present drought . N ear the Phoenix city limits , just past the suburbs of Scottsdale , hugging the McDowell Mountains and out into desert country ( the real Arizona , saguaro cactus , sagebrush , the reds and brOwns of the central desert ) , you can see it a good two miles away in the shimmering heat : a ghastly white massive spout of water , what the developer calls the " snow white column of water , " shooting high into the air , giving an extraordinary sensation of incongruity and violation . " Welcome to Fountain Hills , " the signs say , yet another planned community for the Valley of the Sun , where the world 's highest fountain , higher they say than Pharaoh 's Pyramids , higher even than the Washington Monument , shoots its spray more than 560 feet in the air with three giant turbine pumps belching out 7,000 gallons a minute into a thirty-acre man-made lake that sits undisturbed , a superimposition on desert reality . Phoenix is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growth machine , a builder 's dream come true . The signs are Bob Gottlieb is a freelance journalist and a contributing editor to Los Angeles magazine .

Putnam 's Sons ) . everywhere : the city oozes new planned communities and subdivisions . Leisure World , Sun City , McCormick Ranch , Carefree , Golden Hills , Dreamland Village , the names of the projects match their promo : " Your Place in the Sun : For a Carefree Life Style " ; " Why Wait ? Move into the Best Years of Your Life " ; " The Excitement Is Here and the Dust Has n't Even Settled " ; " Some Call It a Holiday . You Can Call It Home " ; " Do It Now Before the Rest of the World Finds Out . " , The figures are extraordinary . According to a chart prepared by the Maricopa County Planning Department on existing large-scale developments in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developments approved or under construction that will occupy more than 125,000 acres of land with a projected population of upward of 800,000 people . Those are people , few of whom now live in Phoenix , whose arrival over the next several years will geometrically increase the trend toward massive growth that has characterized Phoenix 's development since the late 1950s . In 1978 , more than 117,000 people entered the Phoenix Salt River Valley , or just under 10 percent of the region 's entire .. population . , , di This development is fed- not only by an influx , of people but of corporations as well . Since the late 1960s , the city has made a major effort to attract new businesses , particularly national or multinational companies considering a move of their corporate headquarters . Favorable tax laws were passe'cl to hell : , subsidize such moves , and a number of companieS responded : Greyhound , American Express , Sentry Insurance , MotOrola and Ramada Inn , among others , now have corporate headquarters in the valley . Each move germinates the next : after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , the Phoenix power structure sought to attract several new electronic or software-type companies and plants , thereby establishing this Sunbelt center as a major new high-technology employment area , with the kind of highly paid , skilled work force that could fit in well with the expensive new homes and condominiums of the Arizona life style . The Sunbelt ideology ' has taken hold in Phoenix , and the local power structure is keenly aware of the shifts of power in the country toward Dallas , Houston , Phoenix and Los Angeles . The groundwork for an emerging Southwest power complex has been laid by the combination of the real estate bonanza , population explosion and new corporate infrastructure . And , of course , the government . In this land of sentimentalized frontier values and conservative " let the market decide " ideology , it was the Federal , state and local governments , and not the private sector , that created the foundations of growth . The Federal Government 's Bureau of Reclamation 's first large-scale water project , the Roosevelt Dam , made possible the Phoenix @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ linking the farms to their urban markets helped the development of an integrated , regional economy . Parallel to the developthent of that integrated economy arose an informal network of behind-the-scenes figures who ran the town and decided on the direction of its development . Three key figures stood out above all others : Walter Biinson , head of the Valley National Bank , which financed much of the ' agricultural and real estate development in the valley and thiotigLut the Southwest ; Frank Snell , who put pu together the consortium that created Arizona Public Service , the state 's largest utility , and whose law firm handled Arizona 's crucial water problems , and Ehgene Pulliam , the irascible , strong:minded publisher of The Republic and The Gazette , the town 's only morning and afternoon papers . These three could call on a number of other key local lawyers , bankers and merchants to dictate policy on every issue affecting the valley : . from annexation ( city limits by early 1979 encompassed some 325 square miles ) , zoning , redevelopment , cultural affairs and , most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favorable tax laws , to real estate development , available water , a pro-business climate and the boOster ethic . B y the mid-1960s a new type of businessman had arrived in Arizona : the **27;2481;TOOLONG of gimmicks and fantastic deals who traded in bribes as much as land . Gov . Bruce Babbitt recalls the period =as one when half the state legislators or , county supervisors were on the take and the other half wanted in , ready at a moment 's notice to give up some state land or zoningTestriction for a development scheme cushioned with a " Peilitician 's " finder 's fee . " It was the era of the Robert McCullochs , Ned Warrens and Kemper Marleys : names now associated with the scams and violence that made the headlines after the murder of Arkona Republic reporter Don Bolles . McCulloch was particularly egregious in his tactics . This oilman , chainsaw manufacturer and land developer , who also bought the London Bridge to give " identity " to his Lake Havasu City developMent , bulldozed his way through the Arizona desert to create the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comment that McCulloch did n't need a zoning permit , he needed " a permit to operate a mine . " " You people , " the commissioner said of the McCulloch group , " have committed the biggest rape of the earth I 've ever seen . " The growth machine carried a lot more than land along its way . The population-growth statistics became almost as popular a topic of civic puffery as the salubrious weather : from 186,000 in greater Phoenix before World War II , to 663,000 in 1960 , 971,000 in 1970 , to more than 1.4 million by 1978 . But the **34;2510;TOOLONG establishment wanted more , lots more , eagerly anticipating the predicted " unprecedented growth " that would fuel their " engine for economic development , " as Gil Bradley of the Valley National Bank put it . i Not everybody belonged to the club . A strong constituency in Phoenix emerged out of the expansionist years calling for limits on growth . A recent series of opinion polls conducted by a local polling organization that appeared in the pro-growth Arizona Republic pointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from the barrios on the south side , to the working-class communities on the west , to the middle-class suburbs sprinkled throughout the valley . Yet , although strong majorities said they " deplored growth , " many of the same respondents felt growth was inevitable ; an attitude only reinforced when figures like Phoenix Mayor Margaret Hance said of the polls that she could n't really believe.that people meant what they said . " The people I talk to , " she said , " do n't feel that way about growth . " In many ways the growth explosion makes Phoenix look ' something like a war zone . Unfinished roads pass through agricultural fields or desert land to then run adjacent to new subdivisions that are half completed . Mayor Hance and her council allies talk ' of the need to annex land to the city to control development ? " It will happen beyond the city 's boundaries anyway " ? and to prevent a " Newark or St. Louis situation " from happening , meaning the middle-class tax base fleeing to the suburbs and starving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like most of the new Western cities , never had an inner-city problem . Expansion operated according to its own inner laws , unrelentingly . New subdivisions were built where it was physically possible , creating their own urbanization patterns . Sprawl might well be a misnomer for such a pattern . There is little to sprawl from or to ; the urban expansion process has no center , no ecological boundary point . The metastasizing urban cancer metaphor works better . " I guess what we call sprawl , " declared Duke Tulley , a newcomer to the Phoenix power structure , " they call Arizona life style . " And so much of that life style is focused on water . Water consciousness rivals weather consciousness and population data . Everywhere are signs to remind you that somehow , somewhere , water is plentiful : fountains , sprinklers , grassy medians artificially created and , of course , lakes . Arizona has more artificial lakes than anywhere else in the world , and , as its boosters love to point out , more boats per capita than anywhere in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Phoenix Valley does have some water ; water stored in the ' ground that has been pumped over the years to ' provide first agriculture and now urbanized development with its necessary ingredient . Arizona also has an extensive network of water irrigation projects and dams , the key one located along the Salt River , which borders and runs through Phoenix . These water projects had been used for many years exclusively for agricultural operations , though some early conflicts over water pitted the large farmers against the big mining interests who ruled over the southern part of the state . In the late 1940s , the farming interests , declaring that pumping was slowly depleting all the ground water , pushed for a new project to utilize water from the Colorado River through a system of waterways and dams that was known as the Central Arizona Project ( C.A.P. ) . After a complex history of favorable court rulings ( against California ) and Congressional maneuvering ( linking up with some Rocky Mountain interests ) , C.A.P . was passed in 1968 : an extravagant , costly ( total @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subsidize the future of Arizona agribusiness . But then a funny thing called development happened along the way , and those agricultural lands inexorably began to give way to new subdivisions , a process the farmers happily called conversion . The farmers had good reason to rejoice : they were making big profits from the sale of their lands or , in some cases , sharing with the subdivider by investing in the development scheme . Agricultural lands require far more water than even the most extravagant subdivision , so the logic behind C.A.P . has been undermined . Yet the forces mobilized behind C.A.P. ? the cross section of Arizona 's business and political establishment led by such anti-Government-spending conservatives as Barry Goldwater and John Rhodes  --  have come up with a new idea : the water is needed for what is ' called " m. - &; i. , " i.e. , municipal and industrial use . We do n't need the water for what exists now in Phoenix the water lobby argues , but for the population that is to come . Those needs , in fact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a specific figure . Growth , the boostersargue , has no limits . Plentiful water preserves , as Mayor Hance has put it , " the constitutional right to relocate in Phoenix . " The prophecy is self-fulfilling : water feeds development feeds the need for more water feeds new development : an unending cycle in this brave new Sunbelt world where ownership of " water-intensive " air conditioners is perhaps the most important single class distinction . In the Valley of the Sun , the other side of the tracks consists of homes without surcease from the 1I5-degree summers . Despite the Sunbelt protestations to the contrary , class divisions in Phoenix are real  --  and extreme , Unemployment figures during recessionary periods are higher than national averages , without taking into account the thousands of Mexican migrant workers who work and live in their cardboard shacks provided by the big agribusiness interests in the northwest section of the valley . Yet , amid some of the worst poverty in the region , the Del Webb Company , in conjunction with cotton grower J.G. Boswell , built a model @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the middle of this farming region . Within twenty years , the Webb corporation created a ' mini-city of 50,000 upper-and middle-class whites , mostly relocated Midwesterners , all over the age of 50 and living in rows and rows of small and middle-size single-family dwellings with their eleven golf courses , three country clubs , several ' recreation centers , shopping centers , restaurants and a 200-bed hospital called the Boswell Memorial Hospital . There are no blacks or Hispanics in Sun City and even visiting grandchildren under the age of 18 ca n't use the recreation facilities . It is a closed , walled-in slice of what Webb likes to think of as the end point of the American dream . But the consequences of creating this mini-city for the politics and " life style " of the region are extraordinary . Sun Citians are an incalculable economic and political force . Banks proudly declare that those 50,000 well-to-do immigrants have more money ( $1 billion in 1978 ) on deposit than any single per-capita grouping in the valley . Sun Citians also vote , and the legislature and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ representatives who stand firm against the forces of fiscal irresponsibility and godless Communism . The conservative " I wo n't pay a dime for these ' illegal aliens ' " Sun Citians consistently vote down bond measures for schools and other services in the area . The hospital , run by Webb and Boswell , refuses to accept those who ca n't pay for their services , i.e. , any Of the undocumented migrant workers who can not receive Medicare , or insurance protection . A lawsuit recently filed against the hospital involved just such a case  --  an undocumented worker whose arm had to be amputated after he was refused service at the hospital . Racial tensions are potentially explosive in the Sunbelt , though they too'remain hidden , under the surface . The proximity of the Mexican border is not the only sore point ? Indians are once again coming back to haunt an expansionist Arizona . The most cherished part of the C.A.P . complex  --  the Orme Dam on the northeast of Phoenix , intended for irrigation , flood control and various other water needs  --  has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who live on a reservation that would be flooded if the dam went through , decided , they 'd rather keep their land than receive financial conriperisation . Though much discontent exists about the growth machine , no politician , at least in Phoenix ( and even a Udall supports C.A , P , 91for Tucson 's developing future ) , has emerged to tap into it . Phoenix Mayor Hance wears her pro-growth badge proudly and unabashedly commits Phoenix funds to the t water lobby 's organization . She sits on the board of director , of the Valley National Bank ( " Of course I would n't votelowsomething that directly concerns them , ' " - she says , though it 's hard to see what does n't concern the V.N.B. in Phoenix ) , and thinks of a career in " community relatiOns " for a large corporation once she retires from politics . Governor Babbitt strikes a different image than his Phoenix counterpart , but he also has made his peace with the state 's power structure , A member of , the family that ran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? the Valley National Bank , board ) , Babbitt got his reputation as the crusading Attorney General who picked up on the Don Bolles investigation while befriending the out-of-town reporters from the Investigative Reporters and Editors group whose extraordinary series on organized crime and land speculation end profiles of some of the Arizona power structure , inclUding the Goldwater brothers , top Republican kingpin Harry RcoSenzweig and builder and casino , operator Del Webb , Causedenormous concern to the Phoenix business establishment . Babbitt , as he delved into white-collar crime , seemed a possible threat , maybe even some kind of populist . " I remember how Bruce joined our rap sessions , talking about subverting the system , and using environmentally inspired lawsuits , " one fellow law student recalled of Babbitt 's days at the University of Arizona . Then , unexpectedly , after one gubernatorial resignation ( to take an Ambassador 's post ) and ' another governor 's death , Babbitt , by the line of succession , found himself in the State House .. Soon after , he ran for election ' for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his love of the outdoors , his books on the Grand Can-yon and his desire to protect state , lands from speculators . He became , for many of those who had been on the edge of despair about the future of the growth machine , a breath of fresh air , a possible hope for an otherwise bleak-looking future . But Babbitt , since assuming the Governor 's post , has , in a style similar to Gov . Jerry Brown 's , established rapport with the business/booster types , appointing as one of his top advisers the man who 'd been the link to the growth ' forces under the previoirs governor , talking a fiscal conservative line on budget matters and supporting C.A.P . against what he calls California 's " rapacious demands . " Even Babbitt 's talk of holding back state lands from development until a workable , orderly plan is created was confounded by his creation of a committee on the state lands that was overwhelmingly pro-developer and chaired by Gary Driggs , a Savings and Loan executive and one of the biggest pro-development voices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the , market forces encouraging development , , , " The market is overwhelming and will overwhelm all in its path , " he declares , his voice rising in pitch . " It 's what the people want , " he goes on . " Popular enterprise is just following the popular will. ; ' Driggs 's maps are spread out , showing where the metastasis might spread next , his figures demonstrating that despite the 1974-75 recession , when some developers , himself included , took a bath , building starts had since gone way up , to four times their previous figures . It can never end , Driggs and his developer friends seem to say , this empire on the desert can grow as wide as the desert itself . If you watch the fountain at Fountain Hills , you can , see in the desert heat how some of the spray evaporates into the air before it falls into the artifiCial lake . Then , all of a sudden , when ' fifteen minutes are up , the turbines , get turned off , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ column of water collapses , and , with a thump , disappears into the lake. , And then , nothing . Just the quiet of the land and the silence of the desert . ?
