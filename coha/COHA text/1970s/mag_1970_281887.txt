The essence of bel canto is making the vocally difficult sound delectable . Long , lung-stretching phrases , rococo trills , breathtaking leaps of voice slide into the air and ear with soft , summery ease and grace . The quintessential bel canto role is Norma , the most taxing female part in all opera . Giuditta Pasta , the first singer to try the part after Bellini created it in 1831 , found it so difficult that the violins had to play out of tune deliberately to disguise her failures . <P> Last week New York 's Metropolitan Opera offered a new Norma production with Joan Sutherland in the title role . Hardly had she finished her first duet with Mezzo-Soprano Marilyn Horne ( as Adalgisa ) than the audience began to cheer and occasionally stamp and yell . The enthusiasm was fully justified . Sutherland 's voice warmed toward a soaring , languorous tenderness . Horne , making one of the greatest Met debuts , showed a vocal reach and richness that exceeded nearly anybody 's gasp . In Mira , O Norma , closing Act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a violin being stroked by the same bow . The way their voices blended and interwove produced moments of sheer delight-moments to justify opera and fleetingly suggest that the shaky conspiracy called civilization may actually be worth all the trouble . <P> Horne 's triumph at age 36 raised an inevitable question : why had it taken her so long to get to the Met ? The often suggested answer is Rudolf Sing 's well-known preference for European singers . But the truth is that Home was not interested in making her debut in such customary mezzo roles as the bitch ( Amneris ) in Aida or the witch ( Azucena ) in Trovatore . What she wanted and got was a role demanding enough to show off a voice already broader in stylistic range than that of any soprano singing opera today . <P> Lyric Triumphs . Like Beverly Sills , who also has never sung at the Met - and should-Marilyn Horne has been hailed in concerts and operas everywhere else . She also put in three years singing in provincial opera houses in Germany , an apprenticeship that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so low that she lost a few bars because she could not see the conductor 's baton . Subsequent triumphs at the San Francisco and Chicago Lyric Operas , Covent Garden and La Scala were proof of her versatility . In 1960 , back in the U.S. , she married Henry Lewis , a young Negro who now is conductor of the New Jersey Symphony . Though her white friends warned her against it , black-white hostilities have been little problem . What caused a strain , Marilyn admits , was not an interracial marriage but an interartistic marriage . " We stay away from each other before concert time , " she says . " Until we learned that , it nearly ruined us . " <P> She has been singing with Joan Sutherland since 1961 . " It 's like a fairy tale , " Marilyn explains their collaboration . " We never have to work to sing together . We just learn our parts and come together , and it 's been there all along . " Her next new role will be as Fids in Meyerbeer 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Turin and London . " Fids is Norma for contraltos , " she explains . " I 'm looking forward to it . " Meanwhile Rudolf Bing , the Met and its followers can look forward to 18 more performances of Norma before the season closes .
