txt From his front door Mr. Son can see the Political Warfare Department banner with red letters that recalls what happened to his old straw house : " Be determinea to exterminate Communists to avenge the people of Thanhmy hamlet , victims of the June 11 massacre . " The massacre ? one of the worst in South Vietnam since the Lunar New Year offensive of 1968 ? is easier for the South Vietnamese to build over ' than to forget . A band of Vietcong invaded Thanhmy , one of three hamlets in a village called Phutank. and laid it waste with mortar fire , satchel charges and incendiary grenades . Seventyeight people , most of them women and children , were killed by white-phosphorus grenades tossed into narrow , mud-walled bomb shelters , where the people had hidden when the explosioqs started . Of the hamlet 's houses 295 were destroyed and the 180 remaining were heavily damaged . The only industries , the rice mill and the sawmill , were blown up , and nearly all of the pigs and chickens were destroyed . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Regional Forces militiamen and nine United States marines who were part of a pacification team . Orders Were Disobeyed The team 's commander , Lieut . Thomas S. Miller , 27 years old , of New Kensington , Pa. , believes that much of the loss of life might have been avoided if the militamen had followed orders and placed a defensive ambush on the eastern edge of the hamlet , where the enemy force entered . The lieutenant explained that they considered the bridge their first responsibility and refused to leave their outpost to counterattack when the raid began . By 3 A.M. the Vietcong had withdrawn but mortar fire continued for some time despite attacks by allied aircraft guided by the burning hamlet . All but a few of the houses have since been rebuilt from packing-case lumber donated by the United States Marine units in the area . Tin roofing and small amounts of money were provided by the South Vietnamese Government . The sawmill and the rice mill , where the grain is polished , both run privately at great expense to the users , are being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being brought in by the Government to replace runty , sway-backed animals . Although the people  --  most of them with links to the Government in Saigon through the military or because of business connections  --  are sheltered in better houses than before , the raid has left serious problems and scars . The greatest problem for most was the loss of life savings ; many others lost their means of livelihood . Two Huses Were Lost Trinh Van Huong , who is 67 years old and partly blind , used to support himself making conical leaf hats while his wife sold drygoods from a stall in the market . They moved to Thanhmy a year ago when their first house was blown up in allied airstrikes ? " two houses gone in two years , " he said while sitting in the market . " I used to make a hat a day if I worked late , " he continued , " but now all my leaves and hoops for making them are burned , and so is my wife 's stuff , and there is no money to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a house went for the funeral of Mr. Huong 's tubercular son , who was killed in the raid , and he says he could not build a new house by himself anyway . He and his wife spend the nights with friends , but he does not seem to mind . " I do n't think about the house , " he said almost harshly . " I just think about eating and staying alive . " Other home industries , such as making pitch for caulking junks and sampans , basketweaving and carpentry , also went in the flames . The deepest scars are still carried in the people 's memories . Next to Mr. Son 's altar over the back door hang stiffly posed portraits of his parents and of his wife , who , along with his two children and 15 neighbors , were burned to death in the bunker behind his house . ' Why I Am Still Alive ' " At first I got in the shelter with them , " he recalled , " but after a moment I left . I thought if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they would kill me because I used to be a soldier . So I left and hid in the fields . " He paused . " And that is why I am still alive and my family is dead . " A neighbor , Ho Thi Sanh , said she was not afraid when the mortar shells began to explode in the hamlet just before the attack . The town had been shelled before , she said , during the enemy 's occasional probes against the bridge at the hamlet 's edge that links Danang , 15 miles away , with Quangngai City to the south . Mrs. Sanh , who had herded A resident of the hamlet at a task in his new home . her two sons into the bunker , recalled : " It was very hot and crowded in there . I heard voices outside and a man shouted , ' Shoot anyone who tries to run away ! ' Then someone threw something into the bunker and there was a sound , like when you open a can of beer , only louder , and suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A tear-gas grenade had been tossed into the bunker , which was already filling with the smoke from the burning houses . Mrs. Sanh.remembered that her 4-year-old began to squirm and cry . " I pushed hard against the other people around me , " she said , " and cleared a space for him on the ground , and I pressed his face close to the earth and tried to cover him with my body . " " People were coughing , " she continued , " and I was wet with sweat , and tears ran from my eyes . Then I do n't remember anything . " Mrs. Sanh said she regained consciousness several hours later , after the raid ended . " I do n't know when my son died , " she said . " My other son , the 7-year-old , was somewhere else in the bunker . He died too . " Vietcong Saved Some Several villagers were saved by the Vietcong themselves , some of whom appeared unwilling to attack the civilians . Le Vinh , a 12-year-old schoolboy , was helping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to remember . He had , been hiding in the bunker in his house with his mother and younger brother when three , guerrillas burst in and ordered them out . " When we got out , " he said , " the Vietcong threw a grenade in the bunker anyway . We ran outside and lay down on the , ground . My little brother started to cry , and my mother slapped ) him . ' Shut up , or they 'll come back and kill you ! ' she said . " " We stayed there until morning , " the boy continued . " I did n't go to sleep . I was n't sleepy . I ' could see everything , the fires were so bright . I did n't say anything , but my mother kept saying , ' Oh God ! ' And she sighed a lot . " The only allied fatality that night was Lance Cpl . Stephen Geer of Bolton , Conn. , who was hit by mortar fire while leading his patrol against the attackers in the marketplace . Four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ post and a fifth , a prisoner , was shot by the militiamen when he was caught trying to escape by boarding a United States Marine helicopter that had arrived to carry off wounded civilians . He . Is Still ShockedLieutenant Miller is still shocked by the massacre . " I never saw anything so ? so unmilitary , " he remarked , looking for the right word . " I mean , they just came in to get the people . " Why did the Vietcong do it ? The people will not talk about it much , but American and South Vietnamese officials believe that the raid was intended to punish the inhabitants for cooperating with the ? Government and to serve notice on other similar communities . Thankmy was  --  and still is ? inhabited largely by families of men in the Government forces and by farmers and craftsmen with commercial ties to Danang and other Government centers . The officials , confident that the Communists have ' not been able to build up a network among its inhabitants , point out that enemy patrols have repeatedly tripped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do that if they had someone on the inside telling them where the traps are , " Lieutenant Miller said . The Communist 's have also attacked Government-controlled population centers to undermine confidence in Saigon and to deter the people from fleeing to the cities . Special Urgency Seen The tactic may have a special urgency now that United States forces are being called out of the northern provinces , leaving behind the South Vietnamese Army , whose lack of helicopters will make the rural areas safer for the Vietcong . They in turn will need more accessible sources of food , labor and recruits as the South Vietnamese tighten their grip on communities along major roads . Despite the suffering and bereavement in Thanhmy , there appears to be little real hatred here for the Vietcong . People will say they.hate the enemy if the question is put to them directly , but their answers lack conviction . Their frustration and sorrow are directed to the war itself , not one side or the other . " What has happened is beyond my understanding , " Le Thi Phu , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Go ahead and fight and kill each other , " she went on , her voice rising in anger , " But leave us alone ! Do it among people with guns , not among innocent civilians . " Mrs. Phu 's son-in-law smiled at her outburst . Then he went back to work , building a bunker in back of his house .
