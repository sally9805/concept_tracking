" He is not listened to on the floor of Congress , " Walter Lippmann once said , " until he has been heard around the world . " During his 30 years in the Senate - 15 as chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee-William Fulbright has usually caught the ear of the world and finally his colleagues with his prescience , persistence and grasp of great issues . Often he has been nearly alone in his views and often , it turned out , he has been right . <P> Fulbright criticized every President from Harry Truman to Richard Nixon for being too doctrinaire or too heavy-handed in his use of American power abroad . The Senator was one of the few to warn John Kennedy against trying to topple Fidel Castro by landing rebels at the Bay of Pigs , and he opposed the armed intervention by Lyndon Johnson into the confused affairs of the Dominican Republic in 1965 . <P> But Fulbright 's longest and fiercest fight was against the Viet Nam War ( " an endless , futile war ... debilitating and indecent " ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He began badly , agreeing in 1964 to sponsor the Tonkin Gulf resolution at the request of Johnson , an old friend . Ostensibly designed to allow U.S. forces to hit back when attacked , the resolution was interpreted by Johnson as justifying full-scale land combat-the very last thing that Fulbright had in mind . Later he admitted : " I was derelict there . " <P> Fulbright fought the escalation of the war by calling Administration officials before his committee . Then , while the TV cameras and the nation watched , Fulbright would question his man unmercifully with his soft but resonant Southern voice . When Defense Secretary Melvin Laird testified in 1969 that the Nixon Administration was planning to modernize the Vietnamese army and thus reduce U.S. involvement in the war , Fulbright scoffed : " I have heard this before . It is an old broken record ... You 've got to do something radical to change this war or we 're going down the drain . " <P> " Fulbright gave respectability to the dissent , " says Senator Frank Church , a committee member @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. out of Viet Nam , his pleas over the years for realism and compromise contributed to the foundations of detente and Nixon 's visits to Moscow and Peking . <P> Fulbright 's preoccupation with problems abroad overshadowed his record on domestic affairs , which was generally progressive , although the liberals never forgave him for voting against civil rights legislation . He had no other choice , Fulbright would shrug . Coming from a Southern state , it was a matter of survival . In 1954 , Fulbright did show real political courage by voting alone in the Senate against funding Senator Joseph McCarthy 's Red-chasing sprees . Fulbright called McCarthy " an animal " for his excesses ; in return , he was dubbed " Senator Halfbright . " <P> Ironically , although his earlier stands have been vindicated , Fulbright has lost influence in the Senate during the past three or four years . He no longer has the same combative energy , and he has often failed to do his homework . On key issues ranging from arms limitation to trading with the Russians , Fulbright has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Henry M. ( " Scoop " ) Jackson .
