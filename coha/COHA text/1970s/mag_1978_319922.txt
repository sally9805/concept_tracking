Accident , madness and suicide have only one effect on an artist 's career : they stop it . But they can do wonders for reputation . We might feel different about Van Gogh if , instead of shooting himself in the gut at 37 , he had died full of age and honors in bed . The demand for Jackson Pollock 's least scribble might be less fierce if a skidding car had not sent him the way of James Dean . And what of Mark Rothko , who killed himself with a razor and pills in 1970 ? In hindsight , death appeared to be the central image of Rothko 's late , dark , claustrophobic canvases . Indeed , his suicide gave his art a simplified legibility that it did not really have- the operatic wholeness of art and life that a myth-hungry audience expects of peintres maudits . In a grisly sort of way , Rothko 's suicide has been taken by the art market as a proof of sincerity and translated into cash value .

Death and money ; Rothko was terrified of one and catastrophically incompetent with the other , but they made him-and his work-famous in the end . <P> Last week the largest retrospective of Mark Rothko 's paintings went on view in Manhattan . Organized by Art Historian Diane Waldman for the Guggenheim Museum , it will travel later to Houston , Minneapolis and Los Angeles . It consists of almost 200 paintings , spanning a career of more than 40 years . They run from his first tentative exercises in the manner of Milton Avery , his mentor , whose soft , vibrating patches of color had an indelible effect on Rothko ; thence to the curious , stilted subway scenes of the 1930s , and to the totemic abstracts of vaguely identifiable figures-in-landscape which were the staple of his work up to the end of World War II , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1944.
