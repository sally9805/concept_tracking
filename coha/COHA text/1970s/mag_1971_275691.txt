If media hot and media cool have shrunk the world to the dimensions of Marshall McLuhan 's global village , then last week 's Academy Awards made a certain amount of sense . Hollywood 's annual orgy of self-adulation was really the commencement exercises at good old Global Village High , complete with prizes , dull speeches , strained humor , amateurish entertainment-and one hell of a party afterward , for winners and losers alike . At least two things made this year 's ceremony , silly as it always is , a little bit different : the most popular girl ended up winning none of the prizes , and one of the biggest awards of all went to the truculent dropout of the class . <P> The lovely loser , of course , was AH MacGraw , whom many figured a shoo-in for the best actress award . To be sure , there were complaints that her performance as Jenny Cavilleri in Love Story was n't quite up to her Brenda Patimkin in 1969 's Goodbye , Columbus . But-by Academy standards-did n't the film deserve a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ runaway box-office triumphs ( well over $30 million so far ) ? And had n't Ali 's husband , Bob Evans , earned an Oscar or two for his contributions to Paramount 's growing profits ? <P> Sheer Merit . Ali , as it turned out , knew better than a lot of insiders . A week before the awards ceremony , she and Bob and another couple had written down their predictions and sealed them in envelopes , with a bottle of champagne to go to the winner of their contest . Ali missed only one of the eight major awards : she picked Karen Black ( Five Easy Pieces ) as best supporting actress instead of Winner Helen Hayes ( Airport ) . Otherwise , though , Mrs. Evans was as prescient as could be : she correctly named Patton for best picture , best direction ( Franklin J. Schaffner ) , best actor ( George C. Scott ) , and best original screenplay ( Francis Ford Coppola and Edmund North ) ; Glenda Jackson ( Women in Love ) for best actress ; John Mills ( Ryan 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Love Story ) for best musical score . It was too much to expect that she would also have picked the Oscar ceremony 's best decolletage , which clearly and defiantly belonged to Sally Kellerman ( M *A* S*-H ) . The major surprise was the unwanted Oscar that went to Scott , whose well-publicized determination to snub Hollywood 's " meat parade " was the butt of what passed for the evening 's jokes . As for Scott himself , he slept through the televised ceremony at his New York farm ; his sons woke him up to accept a mock substitute award from some friends : a statue of Abraham Lincoln with the words GOD A'MIGHTY , FREE , <P> FREE AT LAST . <P> Grudgingly , most of moviedom had to concede that Scott had won his Oscar on sheer merit . Much less grudgingly , they had to say pretty much the same about the relatively unknown British housewife ( see following story ) who duplicated the 1969 Oscar success of her countrywoman Maggie Smith by walking off with the best actress award .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
