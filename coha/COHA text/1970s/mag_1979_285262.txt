It 's beautiful but lonely <P> From the patio of the pale stucco house , a Panamanian gunboat can be seen cruising the richly blue-green waters . Guards armed with pistols and submachine guns patrol the driveway , and a German shepherd attack dog trots around the unfenced grounds . Perched on a cliff 50 yds. from the bay , the house itself is a modest dwelling , consisting of only six rooms . But for the latest occupant of the building , owned by former Panamanian Ambassador to the U.S. Gabriel Lewis Galindo , it is a much needed haven . " Such surroundings , such hospitality , are not going to be easy to match , " said Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi last week about his new sanctuary . " I feel like home . " <P> Home now for the deposed Shah is Contadora , an island a little more than a mile square lying 20 miles off Panama in the Pacific Ocean . Part of a necklace of 226 other islands called Las Perlas ( The Pearls ) , Contadora earned its name - Spanish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Spaniards as a place to count their catch from the surrounding pearl-rich waters . In the 1920s , a mysterious disease killed off the oyster beds , and for decades Contadora remained just another of the obscure-if beautiful-islands that speckle the Gulf of Panama . Then , in the late 1960s , the motorboat of the wealthy Lewis conked out near the island , and he came away with blueprints dancing in his eyes . For $30,000 he bought the island , and development was under way . <P> Today Contadora is Panama 's star resort , with a government-owned casino and 210-room hotel ( average room price : $70 a day ) . About 80 weekend homes owned mostly by wealthy Panamanians dot the beaches and hills . Palm , papaya and banana trees shade the island , and peacocks and deer roam freely . Temperatures climb to a torrid 95 during the day , but drop to a breezy 70 in the evening . The resort is just now entering its busy season , with the hotel booked solid through April . And , understandably , the tourists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ People are concerned about their own safety , " says Tour Operator Andrew Hunter . " They are asking , ' Will it be safe for us ? ' " <P> The Shah 's own security staff of eight has already been beefed up by at least 50 members of Panama 's guardia . So far , the Shah has ventured out rarely , but when he goes out for the simplest of reasons , so goes the entourage : when he walked his Great Dane on the island 's main beach last week , ten security men walked with hun and a red sedan filled with more guards drove behind . It is a measure of the Shah 's exile that in those circumstances any place can feel like home . ?
