txt Earl Russell , the philosopher and mathematician , died at his home in Wales last night . He was 97 years old . The winner of the Nobel prize for literature in 1950 , Bertrand Russell was best known in recent years for his campaign against war , nuclear bombs and racial discrimination . Advancing years did not diminish Lord Russell 's fervor . In December he appealed to Secretary General U Thant of the United Nations to support an international war crimes commission to investigate alleged " torture and genocide " by the Americans in South Vietnam . He was at his home in Penrhyndeudraeth in Merionetshire when he died at 8 P.M. He had been suffering from influenza . Governed by 3 Passions " Three passions , simple but overwhelmingly strong , have governed my life : the longing for love , the search for knowledge and unbearable pity for the suffering of mankind . " In those words Bertrand Arthur William Russell , the third Earl Russell , described the motive forces of his extraordinarily long , provocative and complex life . But only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he said , and only Leta Meitner-Graf , Bertrand Russell when he was 80 and married his fourth wife , Edith Finch , then a 52-year-old American . Of his search for knowledge , he reflected , ' a little of this , but not much , I have achieved . " And as for pity : " Echoes of cries of pain reverberate in my heart . Children in famine , victims tortured by oppressors , helpless old people a hated burden for their sons and a whole world of loneliness , poverty and pain made a mock . ery of what human life should be . I long to 41eviate this evil , but I can not , and I too suffer . " Russell 's self-assessment scanted his lifelong passionate such as Whitehead and Wittgenstein ; scientists such as Ein stein , Niels Bohr and Max Born ; writers such as P. G. Wodehouse , Joseph Conrad , D. H. Lawrence , E. M. Forster , T. S. Eliot , Ezra Pound , George Bernard Shaw , Maxim Gorky and H. G. Wells ; and political figures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Lenin and Trotsky . They numbered in the hundreds , and Russell maintamed a lively correspondence with them . Someone calculated , in fact , that he wrote one letter for every 30 hours of his life . As a young man , gaunt and black-haired , Russell favored a flowing mustache and high starched collars . In his autumnal years , his spareness became frailty and , mustache discarded , he resembled a frost-famished sparrow . His glittering eyes and half-smile , combined with a shock of white hair , gave him the appearance of a sage , at once remote and kindly . It was a visage cartoonists delighted to draw . Baffled by Light Bulb Although he wrote a book about the mysteries of relativity , he humorously admitted that he could not change a light bulb or understand the workings of an automobile engine . However , he had a reason for everything . William Jovanovich , the American publisher , recalled that as a Harvard student he ate in a cafeteria where the food was cheap and not very good . " I would sit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat the philosopher Bertrand Russell , " Mr. Jovanovich said . " One day I could not contam my curiosity . Mr. Russell , ' I said , ' I know why I eat here . It is because I am poor . But why do you eat here ? ' ' Because , ' he said , " I am never interrupted . " In his last years Russell lived mostly on liquids  --  a food concentrate , soups , puddings , tea and seven double Red Hackle Scotches a day  --  because an intestinal kink had been discovered when he was in his 80 's and surgery was inadvisable . He told a visitor that he had started drinking Scotch as ? a pacifist in World War I. " King George V took the pledge because he thought he could save money and use the money to kill Germans , so I drank , " he explained with a twinkle . The philosopher 's eccentricity , or , as he would have it , his independence of mind , was familial . He was born at Ravenscroft , Monmouthshire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ youngest of three children of Lord Amberley and the former Katharine Stanley , daughter of Baron Stanley of Alderley . His paternal grandfather was John Russell , the first Earl , who was twice Prime Minister and a leader in obtaining passage of the Reform Bill of 1832 that liberalized election to the House of Commons . Father a Free Thinker One of Bertrand 's maternal uncles became a Roman Catholic and a bishop ; another became a Moslem and made the pilgrimage to Mecca ; a third was a combative agnostic . His mother campaigned for votes for women and was a friend of Mazzini , the Italian revolutionary . His father was a freethinker . Together they shocked society by arranging a menage a trois with the tutor of their elder son . Bertrand 's mother died when he was 2 and his father about a year later . Lord Amberley left the guardianship of his sons ( the third child , a daughter , had died ) to the tutor and another man , both atheists . The guardianship was broken , however , by Lord John Russell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1878 , by Lady Russell , a woman of strict Puritan moral views . In the first volume of " The Autobiography of Bertrand Russell , " published in 1967 , the philosopher candidly disclosed his mixed feelings for his grandmother . He felt that she Sartre . I was overly protective ; on the Friends included - philosophers other hand , be admired ( and man . and I have to restrain him . " Last December , Russell disavowed any connection with Mr. Schoenman after the former secretary announced an investigation by the American branch of the Peace Foundation into alleged atrocities by American soldiers in Vietnam . Russell said Mr. Schoenman , an American , had not been his secretary for more than three years . A gentle , even shy man , Russell was delightful as a conversationalist , companion and friend . He was capable of a pyrotechnical display of wit , erudition and curiosity , and he bubbled with anecdotes about the world 's greats . Despite his title , he was " Bertie " to one and all . His charm , plus his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , created for him a worldwide circle of friends . They were a heterogeneous lot , ranging over the years from Tennyson to Graham Greene to Mr. From " The Autobiography of Bertrand Russell " MATHEMATICIAN : Russell In his 30s , when he made major contributions to mathematical philosophy . a visitor in his wafer-thin voice in the spring of 1967 , " I can not be a silent witness to murder or torture . Anyone who is a partner in this is a despicable individual . I am sorry I can not be moderate about it . . . " What I hope is that the Americans will arouse so much opposition that in their own minds they will start to think that it is not worth the trouble . " Convinced by data collected for him in Vietnam that the rn United States was committing war crimes , Russell organized and helped finance a mock trial e of this country 's leaders . The War Crimes Tribunal , presided d over by Jean-Paul Sartre and Isaac Deutscher , met in Stockholm in May , 1967 , and issued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the State Department discounted the testimony adduced by the tribunal , Russell was impressed by the evidence . The tribunal , in the end , caused eonly a minor stir , in part because the Communist press in Europe boycotted its proceedt ngs , Russell later denounced the - Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia . But he also criticized Czechosolvak leaders for what he termed compromising with the occupiers . - Because of the stridency of his views , some charged that , Russell was senile and a dupe of one of his secretaries , Ralph Schoenman , who was also secretary of the Bertrand Russell Peace Foundation and active in the War Crimes Tribunal . Dispassionate reporters who traveled to Russell 's home overlooking the winding Glaslyn River at Penrhyndeudraeth , Wales , found the frail philosopher very much alert . As to Mr. Schoenman , he said , " You know he is a rather rash young answers to the problems which had baffled me for years . And in the course of discovering these answers , I was introducing a new mathematical technique , by which regions formerly abandoned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exact formulae . " In October he sat down to write " The Principles of Mathematics , " putting down 200,000 words in three months . With its publication in 1902 , he plunged into an eight-year task of elucidating the logical deduction of mathematics that became " Principle Mathematica . " Reducing abstractions to paper was a grueling intellectual task . " Every morning I would sit down before a blank sheet of paper , " he said . " Throughout the day , with a brief interval for lunch , I would stare at the blank sheet . Often when evening came it was still blank . " As time went on and the agony of effort increased , Russell " often wondered whether I should ever come out of the other end of the tunnel in which I seemed to be . " Several times he contemplated suicide , but he persevered . However , he said , " my intellect never quite recovered from the strain . " " I have been ever since definitely less capable of dealing with difficult abstractions than I was before , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the world 's great rationalist works , cost Russell and Whitehead , his off-and-on collaborator , ? 50 each to publish . Despite its complexities , the book took the mystery out of mathematical knowledge and eliminated any connection that might have been supposed to exist between numbers and mysticism . In the years when Russell was writing his philosophical works , he continued an interest in social problems by participitating in the woman suffrage movement and in Fabian Society activities . But he was essentially a don until World War I transformed him into a political animal . In the second volume of his autobiography he said that " I underwent a process of rejuvenation " because of the war . " It may seem curious that the war should rejuvenate anybody , but in fact it shook me out of my prejudices and made me think afresh on a number of fundamental questions , " he wrote , adding : " It also provided me with a new kind of activity , for which I did not feel the staleness that beset me whenever I tried to return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ habit of thinking of myself as a nonsupernatural Faust for whom Mephistopheles was represented by the Great War . " A jingoist in the early stages of the Boer War , Russell later became an anti-imperialist ; and in 1914 he was a pacifist , but not a pro-German . He joined the No Conscription Fellowship , delivered a series of rousing pacifist lectures and displayed energy and courage in helping conscientious objectors . He also wrote " War ? The Offspring of Fear , " " Principles of Social Recognition " and " Justice in Wartime . " " Of all the evils of war , " he wrote , " the greatest is the purely spiritual evil : the hatred , the injustice , the repudiation of truth , the artificial conflict . " Russeli was jailed for six months for his utterances . He passed his sentence writing and studying in a comfortable cell in Brixton Prison . His pacifism alienated many of his friends , and in his loneliness he entered into an intense 10 e afftir with the acmatics and philosophy f which , alone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Principles of Mathema ics " and " Principia Mathema ice , " both published befor World War I , helped to dete mine the direction of mode philosophy . Russell 's name , a a result , was linked with thos of such titans of thought a Alfred North Whitehead an Ludwig Wittgenstein . Nobel Prize Winner Largely for his role as philosopher , Russell receive the Nobel Prize for Literatur in 1950 . A year earlier , he ha been named by King George V to the Order of Merit , whos British membership is limited t 24 persons . These honors cas into strange relief the fact tha in 1940 a New York State Su preme Court justice ruled him unfit to teach at City College . Unlike some generative think ers , Russell epitomized the phi losopher as a public figure . H was the Voltaire of his time but lacking in the Sage of Fernay 's malice . From the beginning to the end of his active life , Russell engaged himself with faunlike zest in the great issues of the day ? pacifism , rights for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of education , Communism , the nuclear peril and war and peace ? for he was at bottom a moralist and a humanist . He set forth his views on moral and ethical matters in such limpidly written books as " Marriage and Morals , " " Education and the Social Order " and " Human Society in Ethics and Politics . " He posed awkward questions and gave answers that some regarded as less than commonsensical . However , from his first imprisonment ( as a pacifist in World War I ) to his last huzza of dissent ( as a Zola-like accuser of the United , States for its involvement in Vietnam ) , he scorned easy popularity and comfortable plati:udes . He was , indeed , untam-I able , for he had a profound faith in the ultimate triumph of rationality , which he was cer:ain he represented in an undidactic fashion . " I do n't think , taking it gen  --  rally , that I have a dogmatic : emperament , " he insisted .

" England 's wisest fool " vas what his deriders said . Stand on Vietnam Some of the severest criti:ism was directed at Russell or his condemnation of United itates policy in Vietnam and or his attempts to show this : ountry guilty of crimes against mmanity there . Oddly , the critcism came not only from war oartisans but also from the ioviet Union , a professed ally of North Vietnam , which Rustell believed lacked stanchness oecause it was under the humb of the United States . His vitriolic stand on Viettam stemmed from concern over the possibility of a nuclear var .

" He =pared American actions to le German occupation of zechoslovakia , French terror Algeria and Soviet suppres. on in Hungary . " Whatever happens , " he told tress Colette O'Niel . " Colette 's love was a refuge to me , not from cruelty itself , which was unescapable , but from the agonizing pain of realizing that that is what men are , " he recalled . " I became for the first time deeply convinced that puritanism does not make for human happiness , " he said . " I became convinced that most human beings are possessed by a profound unhappiness venting itself in destructive rages , and that only through the diffusion of instinctive joy can a good world be brought into being . " After the war Russell visited the Soviet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expressed sympathy for the aims espoused by the Commuhists , but he also voiced misgivings about Soviet methods . " For my part , the time I spent in Russia was one of increasing nigl.tmare , " he wrote in his autobiography . " Cruelty , poverty , suspicion . persecution , formed the very air we breathed . There was a hypocritical pretense of equality , and everybody was called tovarisch , ' but it was amazing how differently this word could be pronounced according as the person addressed was Lenin or a lazy servant . " Although Russell was handsomely treated by his hosts , he found their system wanting in logic . In " The Practice and Theory of Bolshevism , " published in 1920 , he concluded : " I am compelled to reject Bolshevism for two reasons . First , because the price mankind must pay to achieve Communism by Bolshevik methods is too terrible ; and secondly , because , after paying the price , I do not believe the results would be what the Bolsheviks profess to desire . " Soviet leaders apparently never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Lenin . In the twenties , after his second marriage , the Russells established an experimental school , the Beacon Hill School , to promote progressive education . Of the children there Russell wrote : " We allow them to be rude and use any language they like . If they want to call me or their teachers fools , they call us fools . There is no check on irreverence toward elders or betters . " The school 's concepts had a wide influence in Britain and the United States , where they were the foundation for scores of similar institutions and practices . Became Earl in 1931 . In 1931 Russell became the third Earl Russell on the death of his brother , John Francis Stanley Russell , the second Earl . He took the honor lightly . Two years later his wife Dora , who had borne him two children , announced that her third child had been sired by another man . The couple 's divorce suit was a nine-days ' wonder in the press . After the decree was ' granted , Russell married his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With the rise of Hitler , Russell opposed Nazi methods , but also opposed any steps that might lead to war . His attitude changed in 1939 after the German invasion of Czechoslovakia and Poland . In " Unarmed Victory , " he explained his shift from pacifism : " I had hoped until after the time of Munich that the Nazis might be persuaded into not invading other countries . Their invasions proved that this hope was in vain , and at the same time evidence accumulated as to the utterly horrible character of their internal regime . " The two factors led me reluctantly to the conviction that war against the Nazis was necessary . " Meantime , in 1938 , Russell began an extended visit to the United States , teaching first at the University of Chicago and then at the University of California at Los Angeles . He also gave a lecture series at Harvard and in 1940 he received an appointment to teach at tax-supported City College . The step loosed a storm of protest from politicians now forgotten and from the Right Rev. William @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York . The Bishop charged that Russell was " a recognized propagandist against religion and morality and who specifically defends adultery . " The registrar of New York County suggested that the philosopher be " tarred and feathered and run out of the country . " A city councilman called him a " bum . " Among other things that incensed critics was a sentence from " Education and the Social Order " that read : " I am sure that university life would be better , both intellectually and morally , if most university students had temporary , childless marriages . " Amid guffaws from the intellectual community , State Supreme Court Justice John E. vacated the appointment on the ground that Russell was an alien and an advocate of sexual immorality . He said Russell would be occupying " a chair of indecency " at City College . For a brief period Russell found himself taboo . " Owners of halls refused to let them if I was to lecture , " he recalled in his autobiography ( the third volume of which appeared late last year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public , I should probably have been lynched by a Catholic mob , with the full approval of the police . " Although he undoubtedly overstated the reaction to himself , Russell did have trouble earning money for i while . From this situation he was rescued by Dr. Albert C. Barnes , the inventor of Argyrol and the millionaire art collector and creator of the Barnes Foundation , who gave him a fiveyear appointment to lecture on philosophy at his foundation , in Merion , Pa . In the fall of 1940 , Russell also gave the William James Lectures at Har , yard . In the next four years he I spoke at various institutions and put the finishing touches on his " History of Western Philosophy , ' the main source of his income for many years . Returning to Britain in 1944 , he continued to write and lecture there . In 1948 he gave the first Reith Lecture for ? the British Broadcasting Corporation . His reputation then , , es in former years , was mixed : He was thought to be wise , $r'et @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was recognized as a brilliant logician but a deficient politician ? as when he wanted to h take advantage of Western atomic superiority to bring the ' Soyet Union to heel . In this he expressed the belief that he was motivated by a desire for Mao man freedom . Russell was lecturing a : : Princeton in 1950 when he Vat awarded the Nobel Prize " ir4 recognition of his many-sided and significant writings , in which he appeared as the champion of humanity and freedom of thought . " Einstein , also at Princeton , was among the first to offer his congratulations . Drive Against Nuclear War Since the middle fifties , Rus sell devoted most of his seemingly inexhaustible energies to a drive against nuclear war . In taking his stand , he proposed that Britain be neutral in the East-West conflict . He urged the withdrawal of United States nuclear arms from British soil . " For my part , both as e patriot and as a friend of humanity , " he said , " I would wish to see Britain officially neutral . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man would wish to see his country obliterated . And as . things stand , so long as Britain remains allied to America , ' there is a serious threat of extermination without the slightest advantage either to America or to the Western way of life . " In furtherance of his views Russell took part in an antinuclear demonstration in London and was arrested for breach of peace . The 89-yearold man was jailed for seven days in Brixton Prison after replying " No , I wo n't " to a magistrate 's request that he pledge himself to good behavior . Although some thought that Russell meddled in the Cuban Missile crisis in 1962 , the main point of his activity , as conveyed in letters to world leaders , appeared to be that no national objective justified a crisis that might lead to world destruction . " If people could learn to view nuclear war as a common danger to our species , " he wrote , " and not as a danger due solely to the wickedness of the oppressing group , it would be possible to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ danger . " The philosopher 's attitudo toward the Vietnam colffict flowed from his desire to , e.dvance the cause of world peace , which he saw endangered by " United States imperialism . " He believed that a rebuff for the United States , indeed a military defeat , would dampen war fires . Russell had a rather pixie sense of humor about himself and death , and in 1937 he composed his own obituary as he imagined it might appear in The Times of London . He disclosed his article in an interview in 1959 . It read in part : " In his Russell 's youth he did work of importance in mathematical logic , but his eccentric attitude toward the first World War revealed a lack of balanced judgment , which increasingly infected his later writings . " His life , for all its waywardness , had a certain anachronistic consistency , reminiscent of that of the aristocratic rebels of the early 19th century ..

" His childhood , as he recalled it , was a lonely one , for most of his companions were adults and he had a succession of German and Swiss governesses . He was rescued , however , by geometry . " At the age of 11 I began Euclid , with my brother seven years his senior as my tutor , " Russell wrote . " This was one of the great events of my life , as dazzling as first love . I had not imagined there was anything so delicious in the world . From that moment until Whitehead and I finished ' Principle Mathematica , ' when I was 38 , mathematics was my chief interest and my chief source of happiness . " As an adolescent Russell read widely , advanced in mathematics and speculated about religion . At 17 he became convinced that there was no life after death , " but I still believed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be irrefutable , " he wrote , adding : " At the age of 18 , however , I read Mill 's ' Authobiography , ' where I found a sentence to the effect that his father had taught him that the question ' Who made me ? ' can not be answered since it immediately suggests the further question ' Who made God ? ' This led , me to abandon the ' First Cause ' I argument and to become an atheist . " Russell 's " Autobiography " recites in detail the painful intellectual struggle that he waged with himself over theology , in the course of which he wrote out in his journal , in Greek , the argumentation that led to his conclusions . Entering Trinity College , Cambridge , at 18 , Russell was soon in the company of its brightest minds ? G. Lowes Dickinson , G. E. Moore , John Maynard Keynes , Lytton Strachey , Charles Sanger , Theodore Davies , Sohn and Whitehead . Among them he became less and less solemn while continuing his devotion to philosophy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " was to find some reason for supposing mathematics true . " Graduating with highest honors , he married Alys Pearsall Smith , a pretty American Quaker five years his senior . The marriage lasted from 1894 to 1921 , but it was terminated in fact in 1901 . " I went out bicycling one afternoon and , suddenly , as I was riding along a country road , I realized that I no longer loved Alys , " he recalled . Subsequently , Russell had several love affairs , including a celebrated liaison with the flamboyant Lady Otto/ine Morrell and another with Lady Constance Malleson , the actress known professionally as Colette O'Niel . His second marriage , in 1921 , was to Dora Winifred Black ; his third , to Patricia Helen Spence , in 1936 ; and his fourth , to Edith Finch , took place 16 years later .

Meanwhile , he became a Fellow at Trinity . The year 1900 was One of the most important of Russell 's life . In July he attended an International Congress of Philosphy in Paris and met Giuseppe Peano , an originator of symbolic logic . Russell devoured Peano 's works . Recounting his exhilaration , he wrote : " For years I had been endeavoring to analyze the fundamental notions of mathematics , such as order and cardinal numbers . Suddenly , in the space of a few weeks , I discovered what appeared to be definite skepticism , which provided the basis for his intellectual stature .
