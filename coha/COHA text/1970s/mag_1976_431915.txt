 | RIP-OFF AT THE SUPERMARKET The nation 's supermarkets , Federal Trade Commission figures suggest , steal $2.6 billion each year from their customers . One scandalized customer , also an experienced journalist , describes a few of the tactics that pad everyone 's weekly food bill . It is the glory and triumph of the American supermarket to have made more food of more kinds available to more people at lower cost than any marketing system heretofore seen on the face of the earth . Such , at least , is the opinion of our supermarket executives , who add that their margins of profit are so paper-thin as to be virtually nonexistent . Their margin is less than a penny on the dollar , they say , and even though food prices are high , they are nonetheless giving us food practically at cost . Another view is provided by Federal Trade Commission figures , which suggest that in addition to their enormous profits , supermarkets steal no less than $2.6 billion from us every year ? through overcharges alone . The FTC estimate refers to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and does not include whatever mistakes cash register operators may make by hitting the wrong keys . My view of our supermarkets is that I do n't care half so much about what they earn or steal as I care about the moral swamp in which they operate . Supermarket people take us for fools , presuming that we know nothing about food ; that we shop impulsively and irrationally ; that we can be cheated with impunity and misled into wasting our money on trash . That is their attitude ; that is their view of you and me ; and if you step over here to the meat counter , I will show you what I mean : Chuck Roast , 87 ? ; California Roast , blade in , $1.03 ; Cross Rib Pot Roast , $1.39 ; Under Blade Pot Roast , 99 ? ; Arm Pot Roast , bone in , $1.29 ; Chuck Roast , boneless , $1.27 ; Arm Steak , $1.18 ; London Broil , $1.53 ; Cube Steak , $1.49 : Stewing Cubes , $1.59 ; Chuck Steak , 87 ? . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SPECIAL ! Now , this store advertises its employment of " Master Butchers . " " The quality of every cut of meat is backed by the signature of a Master Butcher , " their advertising says . " Behind every great cut of meat there 's  | one of our 108 Master Butchers . He puts his signature on each cut he 's responsible for . Proudly . Because he knows there is n't a meat case in town that holds better value than his . In quality . In trim . He has seen to that ? personally . Get to know the name of your Master Butcher . Better yet , get to know him . " Better still , try to find him . If you do , you will learn that his mastery lies as much in creative writing as it does in butchery . All of the meats we see in this case , all of these apparently different cuts at their different prices , happen to be chuck cut in slightly different ways . By masterful butchery and inventive naming , five dollars ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is another meat counter , full of packages of grayish-pink hamburger . A sign over this display says the hamburger has been " extended " by the addition of textured vegetable protein . This means that protein taken from soybeans has been added to the meat . But the sign fails to say what percentage of the hamburger is soybean . You will notice that the individually wrapped packages fail to say there is any at all . Instead , their labels say " MEAT : Beef , 50% ; Pork . 25% ; Poultry , 25% . " Here is a third meat counter , where the Master Butcher is offering us top round steak at $1.69 , and a steak called " Bracciole " at $1.83 . " Bracciole " is a top round steak cut thin . Look at the " Quick Fry Pork Chops ! " They cost 20 ? more per pound than the other pork chops , the difference being that , as in the case of the " Bracciole , " they have been cut thin . Oh , now here they have porterhouse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at $2.99 . The tenderloin and the sirloin come from the same porterhouse . So we can buy the porterhouse at $2.29 ? and remove the bone at home if we want the tenderloin one night and the sirloin another ? or we can pay the Master Butcher roughly $2.40 to cut out the T-bone for us . Since it would take the Master Butcher just as long to remove the T-bone from a three-pound porterhouse as it would for him to remove the T-bone from a two-pound porterhouse ? namely , about ten seconds ? the rate the store is charging for this boning service is higher than the hourly rate charged by a Park Avenue psychiatrist . What the store thinks of us is now very clear . It believes that we can not tell the difference between a chuck steak and an off hind hoof , and that we @# can not reason . It also believes we can not do arithmetic . For example , you may have seen those bags of onions piled up near the turnstiles as we entered the store . The three-pound bags @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , now , over here , in the produce counters , there is a bin of loose onions . They are identical to the ones in the bags . But they are priced at 25 ? a pound . Down the street is another supermarket . This chain advertises that it is honest . " We Do n't Play Games ! " their advertisement says . In this store , we find a special sale of mushrooms at 49 ? , but when we take the mushrooms to the check-out counter , the girl rings up 98 . When we protest , she shows us the chart of prices posted beside her machine . Sure enough , on the chart mushrooms are 98 ? . But when we tell her that the sign on the produce bin said 49 ? , she gives us the mushrooms for 4W , saying , " They never tell us about specials . " If someone is not playing games . then someone is making mistakes that happen to be profitable ones . @# Just before Thanksgiving , my wife and I went to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and there were the birds , on sale at the advertised price , piled in the common grave of a frozen food locker . We had not thought of buying a frozen turkey , but that was the only turkey being sold , and the price was attractively low . As a matter of prudent self-defense , we read the label on a plastic-wrapped bird . The label stated the price per pound , the weight of the turkey , and the price of the turkey . The multiplication was correct . We bought the bird , intending to thaw it that night and Wednesday , begin the cooking Wednesday night , and finish the cooking on Thanksgiving Day . On Wednesday afternoon we unwrapped the now thawed bird and found another plastic wrapper beneath the outer one . This , too , had a label . put on by the processor , stating the weight of the turkey . This weight was three pounds less than the weight stated on the wrapper the supermarket had superimposed upon the processor 's wrapper . According to our bathroom scales , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We had bought three pounds ' worth of nonexistent turkey . Our holiday was somewhat less thankful than it might have been . When we took the two wrappers back to the supermarket on Friday , the store 's reaction was interesting . First , it seemed , the manager was unavailable . It was not until the following Wednesday  | that we found him , and cornered him behind a display of canned fruit juice . " Oh , that 's the meat department , " he explained . " We do n't have anything to do with them , they 're a separate concession . " Where was the head of the meat department ? Well , he was on vacation and no one knew when he would be back . or even where he went . Anyway , it was probably all a mistake , the store manager said . Sorry , no refund . You have to see the meat department manager about that . It might seem as if we had cause for suit , but upon what grounds ? Malice ? Oversight ? The two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had we brought the turkey and the bags into court , how could we prove that the bird we brought to court was the bird that had been in either of the two plastic bags ? And who would bring suit over such a small sum , anyway ? We returned to that meat department , moved now by curiosity , not hunger . We discovered that the stated weight of every piece of meat we tested on their scales was precisely what the label said it was , but when the weights were multiplied by the stated prices per pound , there were grievous errors in every case , and all of them happened to be in the store 's favor . Sometimes mistakes in meaning are made . One seafood supply house advises its client stores that turbot looks like a cross between a halibut and a fluke . and that turbot fillets can therefore " be used as you would fluke or sole . " One store 's interpretation of this advice was to sell halibut fillets as " lemon sole " and " Dover sole " ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wings became " scallops " and crayfish became " baby lobster tails . " Another store cuts wheels of cheddar into wedges , wraps the wedges in differently tinted plastic , and sells them at different prices under the names " sharp , " " old sharp , " and " aged sharp . " The large crumbs caused by the cutting are put into small plastic bags and sold at an even higher price as " cheese bits . " Supermarket managers presumably view us as captive easy marks , impulsive and irrational in our buying habits . To capitalize on this notion they have designed store floor plans and displays to serve as psychological traps . For example , knowing children to be what they are ( which is bored , restless , and wishing they were somewhere other than in the store ) , clever store managers put candy and other juvenile junk food on bottom shelves in easy view of little eyes and within the reach of tiny hands . The children will reach for it and , the manager believes , parents will let them keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are told to put it back . The store is laid out so as to bring the shoppers first to the high-profit items , because research suggests that shoppers begin filling their carts when they come to the first displays of foods . Thus large displays of the higher-profit foods will be located at adult arm and eye levels at the ends of the aisles .  | The lower-profit ones will be found in smaller displays in the middle of the aisles , and/or on shelves above and below normal arm and eye levels . To satisfy the shoppers ' penchant for impulse buying ( meaning the selection of something the shopper had not intended to buy but will put into his shopping cart now that he sees it ) , the impulse items such as soft drinks , snacks , and " gourmet foods " will be placed across the ends of the aisles and close to the check-out counters . Another impulse purchase is the " go-together . " If a store puts on a loss-leader sale of broccoli , and if the manager has his wits about him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hollandaise sauce . Presuming the public is unobservant , or unthinking . or both , a store will advertise a " Special ! Three cans for 60 ? ! " when each can of that item regularly sells for 20 ? . Similarly , a supermarket may advertise a sale on one brand of salad oil . In the store will be a large placard announcing this sale . Beneath the placard , however , will be a huge display of some other brand of much more expensive salad oil . The brand to which the advertising and placard refer may be found in a distant aisle on a shelf display two bottles wide among the Harvard beets . What these practices have in common with outand-out cheating is that both are based on psychological manipulation . The general public , as studies of consumer shopping habits suggest , may very well be ignorant , unobservant , easily misled , impulsive , and irrational . But what kind of people use this knowledge deliberately to take vicious commercial advantage ; to build a store that is a trap ; to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; to wring the most money out of the least thoughtful and the least informed ( who , by the way . are also likely to be the least able to pay the price ) ? One wonders what these store managers really think of what they are doing . and what they think of themselves . @# A man I shall call Oswald Krell was most helpful in answering these questions . Together with his wife . Krell owns and operates a somewhat less than super market that competes with three gigantic chain outlets . He has been in the marketplace ever since he started as a stock boy thirty-five years ago . Krell laughed when I told him about the SPECIAL ! on the three-pound bag of onions that cost 4C more than three pounds of loose onions . " Ah . that 's merchandising. " he said , and chuckled . " It 's that U , that 's what 's so special about them . " " Look . " he said seriously , " you show me where in the law it says that if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's specially low . Maybe it means it 's specially high . Special ' does n't have to mean any price , high or low . All it means is. it 's special , there 's something special about it . All the store was saying is that those onions were special , and that 's what they were : special . " Krell saw nothing wrong with the idea of selling the same part of a steer at several different prices under several different names . " Ah , that 's merchandising , " he said again . It was not really overcharging. because it was a service to the customer . " You take a bone out for a customer , and you do him a service , so you charge for the service . " Krell readily agreed that any customer who wanted to cut up his own chickens and roasts at home could save perhaps a thousand dollars a year by doing so , but instead of seeing the store 's fees as unreasonable , if not grotesque , he said that it just went to show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was one of his customers , and because I evinced a serious interest in marketing and was eager to learn . Krell was glad to tell me u. hat he knew . A series of conversations ensued over a period of weeks , and at the first of these . I wondered how he and his wife could operate a small , independent supermarket in direct competition with three gigantic chain stores in the same section of the city , particularly when his fixed costs are relatively higher than theirs , and when he has to charge more than they do for many items . Part of the answer , he said , lies in personal service . Unlike the giant stores , Oswald Krell 's store will take telephoned orders and make deliveries . Krell will cash checks for regular customers . At Christmastime he sets out liquor and cheeses , cookies and meats for his customers . He allows charge accounts . He keeps an excellent line of meats , and his butchers will cut , trim , and bone to order . There is seldom a long line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a point of remembering names , and because of his courtesy and service , his clientele is willing to pay his **35;0;TOOLONG prices . The rest of the answer , however , lies in certain " supermarket " prices , which seem high enough to permit anyone to stay in business . Each morning Krell receives from his supplier a printed statement showing what every store in the city has paid for its supplies that day . together with the prices they are charging their customers . He showed me such a statement . Generally speak- ing , the figures were sufficiently identical to suggest telepathy , if not collusion . Different prices on some of the same brands and items did obtain in different sections of the city , however , and often within the same chain of stores . When asked about this , Krell explained that every store charges all it can get . " Like take produce , " Krell said . " My markup on produce averages 34 percent . I know , that 's low , but the kind of stuff they send me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the money is . But if I had the store in Crestwood Hills , I could mark it up 100 percent , because those people have so much money they do n't care , and anyway , they 'd never know the difference . Your markup depends on the neighborhood . " Krell showed me his books . His markup on meat was 25 percent ; on canned goods and staples , 14 percent ; frozen foods , 25 percent . The overall average markup on all items in the store was only 18 percent . This figure seemed in line with the general average , according to what could be deduced from the daily reports of supermarket wholesale prices and retail markups . As Krell explained , he could not afford to get too far out of line . He turned next to a daily report from New York City , which , he said , comes out " like on a stock ticker . " The report gives the daily changes in wholesale prices . " Now you know you 're not supposed to change the price once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " So what you do is put two cans of it on the shelf , and you keep the other 500 cans of it in the basement . So you look at the ticker , and it says fruit cocktail is 5R a can today , up 31Z from yesterday , and you remember that you paid 40 ? last week for all those cans in the basement . So as soon as you sell the two cans off the shelf , or throw them away , you go down in the basement . Today 's wholesale price is 5R , so you add your 14 percent markup for canned goods , and you put the can on the shelf for 58 , and now you 're selling a 40 ? can for 58 . There 's no law that says you ca n't buy when it 's cheap and not display it till the price goes up . People do it all the time . It 's what business is all about , you make a little money . " " You know , " he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , and sometimes in the same day . People have actually won and lost fortunes in prune juice . Do n't ask me why . I do n't know , but for a while the price of prune juice was going up and down like a Yo-Yo , and people were betting in prune juice . " He opened a book of audited accounts . They showed what he had paid for electricity , rent , heat , legal fees , accounting fees , wages , truck deliveries , telephone calls , supplies ; all the costs of doing business were there displayed . " This is for 1962 , " Krell explained , " because if I showed you the books for last year , you 'd never come back to the store . " The audited account showed that in 1962 Os-31  | wald Krell and his wife realized a net profit , after deducting costs and taxes , of slightly more than $25,000 . This did not seem a princely recompense for their six-day weeks of twelve-hour days . But these were 1962 figures and indicated that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huge supermarkets with relatively small overheads to live very comfortably indeed . " Of course there 's money in it , " Krell agreed . " I 've been in this business thirty-five years . You asked me who 's primarily responsible for the high price of food today , and out of my experience , I 'll tell you this : it 's the stores . And particularly it 's the big food processors who also own the chain stores , and smart guys like that one who set up Tremendous Kitchens as an outfit in the middle between the processor and the Giant Plastic stores that Tremendous Kitchens owns . " I asked him to explain . " Well , okay , " he said . " So your wife buys Junkies . Those corn things ? Say the wholesale price of Junkies is 20 ? . So this guy orders Junkies by the ton for Tremendous Kitchens . So the Junkie people give him 5 percent off ? if you 're a big guy , you call it a discount and you 're a businessman ; if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're a crook , right ? Anyway , he sells those Junkies to his Giant Plastic stores at the wholesale price , 20 ? a bag , so he 's made 5 percent , selling to himself . But then Giant Plastic marks up the bags , 36 apiece ; they make 16 ( a bag . The Giant Plastic stores got to make money or they would n't be in business . But Giant Plastic is making money for Tremendous Kitchens as well as making money for Giant Plastic , right ? And this guy owns both . Plus he 's getting his 5 percent when he buys from Junkies and sells to Plastic . If you think he 's going to give that 5 percent to the customer , you 're out of your mind . What the hell , it 's a business . " We discussed , briefly , an article that had appeared in the morning newspaper . The president of a supermarket chain had told a meeting of stockholders that food retailers were being subjected to " unwarranted and unjustified " criticism on profits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " are too low to provide a proper return on the capital investment necessary to operate in today 's competitive climate , " and that " if we eliminated all the retail food profits , " the customer would benefit only to the extent of 8 ? per person per week . Krell burst into a roar of laughter . " That 's the guy ! " he said , and laughed . " That 's the guy I was telling you ! He 's the one who owns Tremendous Kitchens and Giant Plastic ! Listen , I know the guy , he 's a member of our country club . Look what else the article says . Tremendous Kitchens ' earnings were $8.9 million last year , which is up $2.7 million over the year before ? and while he 's telling the stockholders this , he 's talking about 8 ? a week per customer is all that Giant Plastic is making . But Plastic is making money for Tremendous , as well as for Plastic . Eight cents a week : he 's got to be kidding . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an Oswald Krell as a guide , the wonderful world of the supermarket begins to take on new meaning , and the accounts appearing in the press become more intelligible . I mentioned the New York Times report that the Grocery Manufacturers of America estimated that their member concerns were being cheated out of $200 million a year through " misredemption " of their newspaper and magazine cents-off coupons . Krell warned me not to be naive . not to believe that it is either the food processors or the stores who are losing all that money . The costs of doing business are always passed on to the customer . Even if the coupons were not misredeemed , he said , they would still add to the price of the products , because they are a form of advertising . The more heavily anything is advertised , the more expensive it becomes . So the customer does not really receive " cents off " when presenting the grocer with a coupon , even if this seems to be the case . The customer is really paying the cost of being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself , Krell had a store to tell . " Okay , now a guy came in the other day and said , Are you the owner ? ' and I said , I 'm the manager . ' Because you do n't want to tell a guy everything you know , right ? Anyway , I 'm the manager , too , so I said I was the manager . " He had a whole suitcase full of coupons . Now . okay , coupons , like food stamps , are a pain in the ass to me , right ? But they 're like money . I send the coupons to the manufacturer , and the manufacturer sends me back the money . This guy wants to sell me the whole suitcase for 50 percent . Now , I 'm no saint , you know what I mean ? " Anyway , you can imagine what would happen if I sent Parkay coupons for two thousand pounds of their margarine when I do n't even carry it in the store . So I told the guy to get lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what ? He 'd quit his job , because now he was making $200 to $300 a week selling coupons at half price to store managers . He spends all week cutting coupons out of newspapers and magazines and then he goes to su- permarket managers and makes a deal . He makes fifty , they make fifty , and who 's to know ? if you 're a manager in one of those big supermarkets , you can get rid of those coupons all right . You send them to a clearing house that weighs them and sends you the money . " Now your wife buys these magazines at the checkout counter , right ? She pays 35C , sometimes 50C for them . But they can be worth $1 or more in coupons . Now while the coupons will save her money , she has to buy the goods . But not the supermarket manager . He redeems the coupons for cash . That 's why your wife ca n't always buy the magazine . The big supermarkets ca n't keep them on the rack because the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " @# As Krell told his stories , I considered other reasons for the price of supermarket food . He had mentioned his membership in a country club , near his home . He was a man in his middle fifties who wore his hair youthfully long and dressed in close-fitting double-knit slacks , colorful sports jackets , and Florentine shoes with square gold buckles on them . His wife , too , was fashionably turned out . Every year they took a winter vacation at Acapulco and a summer holiday in Europe . On every working day they arrived at their store at seven in the morning . At seven in the evening , they turned out the lights , locked the store , and drove home in their Cadillac , which was new each year and always white . They worked long and hard for their money , but they seemed to live rather well on what they earned . One day a salesman entered the store . He represented a bakery specializing in French bread , and after a few minutes he left without having made a sale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Krell mused as we watched the salesman depart . " They have a good product , but , you know , they did n't give me one loaf of bread , not even one roll . How do they expect to do business like that ? When the Humble Pie Farms guy comes in , he says I want you to have these 500 loaves you can give away to your customers so they 'll try them . ' You know what I mean ? " " Yes . It means he gives you 500 free loaves that you can sell for 55 apiece . " " That 's right , " Krell said . " I mean you 're not naive , Humble Pie is n't naive , I 'm not naive , but those French bread people ? how naive can you get ? " He paused to wonder about this . " I 'll be honest with you , " he said . " You know how much I make on milk ? I make enough on milk alone to pay the mortgage on the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how it works ? You say to the dairy , okay , I 'll sell only your products , right ? Then you sell so many quarts over a certain number , and a guy comes around and hands you 5 percent in cash . If they do n't show that cash on their books , which they do n't ,  | you do n't have to show it on yours , right ? The customer comes in and he thinks milk costs so much a bottle : all over town that 's the price of milk . He thinks . The customer does n't know what milk costs . The farmer might not be getting any money , but the dairies are making money so fast they give you 5 percent . I was very naive about milk till I was talking with some guys and they said , Ossie , are you stupid or something , you do n't ask for 5 percent ? ' That 's how I learned . You have to ask for it . So I asked , and the guy comes around with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with cigarettes , " Krell said . " For every carton you order , they give you two free packs . At 500 a pack , they give you a dollar , right ? So you order 20 cartons , and what the customer does n't know , and naturally what the IRS does n't know , is you get 24 cartons , a gift of $20 . I ask you , are the cigarette people making money ? Are the dairies and the bread people making money ? They 're making so much money they can give it away . " If milk paid the mortgage and bought the car . then it was likely that cigarettes paid for Acapulco and bread paid for Europe ; or maybe it was just that all those cans in the basement paid for everything and Oswald Krell was actually more of a saint than he wished to appear at the country club . In any case , someone was paying for the gifts that Krell received , and it is not difficult to imagine who is ultimately picking up the bill . Nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to entrepreneurs much more powerful than an operator as small as Oswald Krell . But the price of food obscures still another hidden charge ? and Krell was sick with worry about it . " You want to know why food is so high these days ? " he said . " Take Giant Plastic down the street . You know what they lose to shoplifters each year ? Fifty thousand dollars . Does n't sound like big money in a store like that , but it 's still fifty thousand , so they add what they lose to the price of the food . How else ? Now they have these uniformed guards that look like state cops with guns . The same at Market Plenty : guards with guns . You buy a dozen oranges , and you also pay people to stand around with guns . " " A lot of times I want to get out of the business , " Krell said . " It 's a lot of work , a lot of headaches . Every time a new food gets advertised on television one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next morning , the people expect it . Then about sixthirty , when we 're closing down , people come in and hold you up . You know , I never thought I 'd see the day , but I 'm going to carry a gun . So the next guy like that ? and you can tell by the way they look ? the next guy who comes into the store just when we 're closing , I 'll just pull my jacket aside and let him see the gun . " @# While the conversations with Krell touched upon a man 's life and work , it seemed to me that they revealed a man making what way he could while contending with circumstances over which he had no control and which were certainly none of his devising . He was different from other supermarket store managers in that he and his wife owned their business , and therefore had a more direct interest in it than the salaried managers of corporate chains . This direct interest they expressed in the personal services they offered their customers , services @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business in competition with huge stores that sold many foodstuffs at prices lower than their own . But otherwise , Krell , like the larger supermarketeers , accepted the terms of a system that told him he was a businessman dealing with the public , rather than a grocer dealing with neighbors . Granted that the neighborhood grocer is a businessman , too . Yet there is a difference between a big business dealing with an anonymous public and a small business dealing with recognizable individuals . Krell had accepted the outlook of big business : he shared the view that he was free to do anything the law did not expressly prohibit . If the law was silent with respect to the meaning of the word " special , " then he was free to give the word his own meaning . His store , too , was laid out as a psychological trap for the customers to whom he otherwise provided courtesies and services ? and he thought this was clever . He almost , but not quite , equated sharp practice with dishonesty . His view was rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its football team and pretends that they are scholars , in that it is a view that lacks a moral base . It embraces the notions If the other guys can get away with it , so can I and You 're stupid if you do n't do it . Whatever is advantageous is seen as intelligent , and whatever is disadvantageous is seen as stupid , and advantage is measured in terms of dollars and cents . At bottom , if a moral swamp can be said to have a bottom , is the notion that business is a game , and that the point of playing a game is to win it . Since this is a prevalent American point of view , it is scarcely surprising that Krell should share it . Few , in any case , question who the losers are .
