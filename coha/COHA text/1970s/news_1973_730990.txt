txt Watch out soybean ? here comes alfalfa ! That oldest and most important forage crop in the world may soon be on your dinner plate , modestly hiding in the bread and stew No longer will you be able to look degradingly at alfalfa as simply good cattle meal , chicken feed , and garbage compost . " Do n't tell me they 'll have us munching hay and oats now ! " grimaced a friend who heard the news . Nor will you have to munch hay or oats ? as a matter of fact the new alfalfa food is not even in the category of crunchies . It is a bland white powder , 90 percent protein , which is processed from the freshly squeezed juice of alfalfa , The United States Department of Agriculture Research Lab in Berkeley , Calif. , recently announced success in converting alfalfa juice into food for man . Today the big squeeze is on . The California test plant is feeding field-chopped alfalfa into presses which produce 100 gallons of juice per hour . And from that juice comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Abundant protein " I have no doubt that alfalfa food substitute will be a commercial product within two years . Several food companies are already planning active programs for it , " said Dr. George 0 . Kohler , the research leader , who has been experimenting with alfalfa uses since 1939 . Soybean has pioneered the age of food supplements . But with the surging world demand for food comes the realization that soybean alone can not feed the protein-hungry countries . Fifty million acres of alfalfa in the world , more than half of which is grown in the United States , appear to hold an answer . In spite of the fact that alfalfa grows less abundantly than soybean , its protein yield is far greater : ? Seventy-seven million tons of alfalfa a year are produced from the nation 's 28 million acres of the crop Only 48 million tons of soybean are produced from its 56 million acres of crop . ? Grown at the rate of five tons per acre , alfalfa produces two to three times more protein than soybean , grown at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more protein per acre than any of the other 25 crops commonly grown in the U.S. for forage and grain. - - - // *Soybeans were fine , please pass the alfalfa // The obvious distinction between soybean food substitute and the newly discovered alfalfa powder is that alfalfa must be processed as a byproduct of animal feed , whereas soybean can be harvested and shipped directly to the market Tastier product However , this very factor could hasten the popularity of alfalfa powder production . As Dr. Kohler explained , " It 's an economical advantage to have the alfalfa - byproduct . It is such a natural process ? it improves the animal feed , making it easier to dehydrate " Scientists have known for years that the world 's greatest source of protein lies in green leaves , and alfalfa leaves in particular . Yet the process of large-scale production of it in a tasty form remained a mystery . Who wanted to chew on bitter green fibers ? The first breakthrough came in 1969 when Agriculture Research Service chemists , under the leadership of Dr Kohler and E. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protein concentrate . Rather than dehydrate the whole plant , they saved the juice and extracted from it a nutritious green powder . Chickens loved it , but still it was just too grassy to be an inviting addition to a tasty ground steak or Danish pastry . " Kids in Nigeria are actually fed this green alfalfa powder . And in India , I saw waifs sitting on the side of the street eating bowls of green leaf protein mixed with grain and sugar . But I decided a long time ago we could never get the people of this country to eat it . " said Dr. Kohler . Europeans interested And so more intense experimenting ensued at the California lab until the final recent discovery that by carefully controlled heating steps , a white protein can be separated from the green protein . Wash it , dry it , and presto ? you nave a bland white powder , superior to soybean in protein content . It will be used in breads , pastas , soups , stews , gravies , ground meats , milk substitutes , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but Europe too ? where alfalfa is known as lucerne ? is beginning to re- spond to the food value of this crop which has been buried in the pasture for so long . In England and in northern France there are pilot alfalfa plants , producing leaf protein concentrate . Other protein supplements are on the horizon , such as safflower , cotton seeds , sunflower , and other oil seeds . " But none of them begin to reach the size and proportion of alfalfa potential . " said Dr. Kohler.
