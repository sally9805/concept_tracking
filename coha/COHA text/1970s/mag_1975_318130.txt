The key issues raised by the current debate over aid to Indochina : <P> <P> How did the U.S. get involved in Cambodia ? <P> <P> In March 1970 , a coalition of military officers , students , urban intellectuals and businessmen mounted a successful coup against Cambodia 's neutralist chief of state , Prince Norodom Sihanouk . Until then , the U.S. had limited ( and sometimes severed ) ties with Cambodia . A month after the coup , Phnom-Penh 's new regime appealed to the U.S. for help in fighting the Khmer Rouge , which was then a ragtag Communist-led insurgency movement . Washington refused . On April 29,1970 , U.S. forces invaded Cambodia to destroy " sanctuaries " used by North Vietnamese troops . The move , said Washington , was partly designed to help Phnom-Penh 's struggle against the insurgents . After that , the Nixon Administration acted as if there were a U.S. commitment to aid the Phnom-Penh regime , although most experts disputed that assumption . U.S. bombing of Communist positions in Cambodia continued until it was finally halted by congressional pressure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government of Cambodia ? <P> <P> It is a republican regime headed by Marshal-President Lon Nol , a leader of the 1970 coup . Cambodia has a one-party Senate , National Assembly and Cabinet ; the Premier is Long Boret . Although partially paralyzed from a 1971 stroke , Lon Nol wields nearly absolute power as head of the government . The 80,000 combat and 145,000 support troops under Phnom-Penh 's command control approximately 25% of the country 's land , about 60% of its 7.6 million inhabitants and all but two of its major cities and towns . <P> <P> Who opposes the Phnom-Penh regime ? <P> <P> After the 1970 coup , more than 5,000 Cambodian rebels who had been training in North Viet Nam returned to their native country and recruited a like number of local Communists . They today form the core of the 60,000 Khmer insurgents ( commonly known as the Khmer Rouge ) fighting Lon Nol 's forces . The non-Communists are primarily conscripted peasants , who Western military observers believe are serving under duress . Prince Sihanouk , who has been living in Peking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , although little is known about the rebels ' real leaders . It is assumed that the heads of several factions ( such as the nationalists and the doctrinaire Communists ) are rivals for power . One leader is Khieu Samphan , a French-educated economist in his 40s , who is the deputy premier of the Khmer Rouge shadow government and commander in chief of its army . <P> <P> Who supports the insurgents ? <P> <P> China provides most of their weapons , North Viet Nam transports them to Cambodia and food is confiscated from peasants in " liberated " areas . Although North Vietnamese troops at first fought alongside the Khmer insurgents , Hanoi 's forces since 1972 have served only as advisers . Soviet aid has been minimal . <P> <P> How is the U.S. supporting the Lon Nol regime ? <P>
