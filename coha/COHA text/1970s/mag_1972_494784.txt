Price is under the impression , widespread at the White House , that an authentic text of the October draft had been passed to McGovern through former Assistant Secretary of Defense Paul Warnke , who was getting White House briefings for the senator 's benefit . Warnke says that he was briefed in some de ? tail on October 28 but was neither shown nor given a text and thus never had one to give McGovern . Its a minor point , academic now , but indicative of the feeling in the President 's vicinity that his opponent and not Richard Nixon was the tricky and devious candidate in 1972 . Edward L. Morgan , a deputy assistant to the Presi ? dent and deputy director of the Domestic Council under John Ehrlichman , never once mentioned a personal contact with the President during 40 minutes of shared remembrance . The closest he came to it was his recollection of being taken along on a visit to a navy carrier and of occasional invitations to state dinners . " I do n't want to make it sound corny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " but the memorable part of it is , the President cares enough to take the little guys along . " One of Morgan 's many domestic tasks was to work on the original version , now in limbo , of the President 's welfare reform pro ? gram . He remembers the thrill he got when he and Richard Nathan , an expert on the subject and a former assistant , were with Governor Nelson Rocke ? feller in New York City and received a telephone call from John Ehrlichman in Bucharest . Ehrlichman , there with the President at the end of a round-the-i world journey in 1969 , said Mr. Nixon needed to know what Rockefeller thought of the welfare draft before approving it . Morgan told Ehrlichman that the governor thought well of it and the episode looms high in his memory of " the first really big one I was on , " Morgan is to be an assistant secretary of the treasury and he looks forward with obvious pleasure to being " part of the President 's team in the departments . " Lee Huebner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? bers submitting the draft of a speech to the President last April , in the living room of his lodge at Camp David in the Maryland mountains near Washington . It was night time and the President was sitting alone in the dark , lights off , thinking . Huebner got back his draft the next morning with a scrawl across the top of the first page : " Lee ? okay ? good job ? RN 4:30 a.m . " He surmised later that the President must have been pondering the recent North Vietnamese attack on northern South Vietnam and his decision , then in the making and soon to he announced , to intensify the bombardment of North Vietnam and mine its harbors . Mr. Nixon said on May 8 that he had to do it in order to end the war . Near the close of the first four years , he is doing it again in order to end the war . As if to underscore the prosecutor 's point that scholars who refuse to answer questions when subpoenaed are entitled to no different treatment than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Samuel Popkin of Harvard when , in the presence of news photographers , they carted him off to jail shortly before Thanksgiving under a judge 's order that he stay there until he would answer three questions to a fed ? eral grand jury . Precisely one week later , a beaming but unyielding Dr. Popkin posed for the photogra ? phers on his release from prison ? a " surprise " devel ? opment credited to the prosecutor 's somewhat belated conclusion that the grand jury did not need Popkin 's testimony after all . The grand jury which had been investigating the unauthorized distribution of the Pentagon Papers ? would not be meeting again , it turned out , before the date on which its term is to expire . Dr. Popkin 's tribulations were contemporaneous with publicized jailings of newsmen in California and New Jersey who had refused , on " reporter 's privilege " grounds , to disclose information sought by local courts . So the issue most mooted in press coverage of Pop-kin 's case was whether a scholar is entitled to the same constitutional privilege @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That seems a curious subject for discus ? sion in light of the Supreme Court 's ruling in the Branzburg , Caldwell and Pappas cases , decided in late June , that there is no source-protecting reporter 's privilege . And what makes that debate even more cu ? rious is that protection of sources is not really what Popkin 's claim was about . The three questions for which he went to jail did not ask him to divulge the names of anyone in government service who had given him information . The federal court of appeals in Boston ? which had ruled on Popkin 's claim before the Supreme Court decisions in Branzburg , Caldwell and Pappas ? had been far more sympathetic to the public interest in protection of sources than a majority of the Supreme Court turned out to be . It had distinctly or ? dered that Dr. Popkin could he compelled to give names only " to the extent that the persons were not government officials or other participant-sources . " In other words , Dr. Popkin went to jail rather than disclose the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pentagon Papers and from whom he may have learned the names of participants in the study . lie also chose jail rather than answer the direct question of whether he had discussed the Pentagon Papers with Daniel Ellsberg during the six months before their publication . These questions were appar ? ently important enough to the Department of Justice that it pressed for answers even to the point of jailing DECEMBER 23 &; 30 , 1972 Popkin to compel him to reply . Yet one week later , it was disclosed that the grand jury investigation was over , at least for the duration of the Ellsberg trial in Los Angeles . This sudden turn of events highlights the most threatening aspect of the Popkin case . It demonstrates that Professor Popkin spent a week in jail entirely at the option of the Department of Justice and solely be ? cause , as of Thanksgiving eve , the prosecution was still not ready to admit in court that the answers it was demanding served little or no legitimate purpose . Throughout the court proceedings that led up to Pop-kin 's jailing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investigating in good faith into the commission of federal crimes , and that the questions it was asking were necessary steps in that investiga ? tion . Judges routinely accept the notion that grand juries have sweeping powers of inquiry , and they sel ? dom interfere with grand jury subpoenas issued in apparent good faith . Popkin 's lawyers had argued vigorously that when a witness appearing before a grand jury is asked ques ? tions that might restrict free speech or free press , the prosecutor should not be able to compel an answer un ? less he satisfies a judge that the question is relevant and that the information can not be obtained else ? where . The court of appeals decision written by Judge Frank Coffin usually sensitive to civil liberties ? re ? jected that argument with the observation that a grand jury 's " processes may include the pursuit of numer ? ous strands of evidence , many of which may ultimately be of no use , but none of which can safely be aban ? doned . " Similar language was used by Justice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Branzburg , Caldzvell and Pappas cases : " The role of the grand jury as an important instrument of effective law enforcement necessarily includes an investigatory function with respect to determining whether a crime has been committed and who committed it . To this end it must call witnesses in the manner best suited to perform its task . " Ordinarily , of course , when a witness is compelled to testify , he appears in open court , before a judge , and he ? or other parties interested in his testimony ? can object to questions asked of him and can rely on the judge to protect the witness from harassment and to keep the interrogation limited to relevant subjects . A witness before a grand jury has no such rights : he tes ? tifies in secret , his lawyer is not permitted to be at his side , and the courts rarely interfere . What is it about a grand jury that makes it so high and mighty ? The grand jury is a group of citizens ( numbering 23 in the federal system ) whose function @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de ? cide whether a formal charge ? or indictment ? should issue . Federal grand jurors are picked from the same voting rolls as trial jurors , but what they do and how they do it is significantly different . Federal grand jury:19 sessions are run by a prosecutor ? either a local United States attorney or a Department of Justice lawyer ? and the proceedings are informal and secret . The grand jurors hear only what the prosecutor wants them to hear , and at the conclusion of the presentation the prosecutor asks them to vote on whether there is " probable cause " to charge the commission of a crime . A majority of the 23 members decides ( unlike trial juries which must , in criminal cases , be unanimous ) , and in over 99 percent of the cases , it rubber-stamps the indictment the prosecutor wants to issue . There is another aspect of the grand jury 's proceed ? ings where the 23 jurors play virtually no part , but where their presence gives the prosecutor substan ? tially more power than he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time in their history , roam the countryside investigating crimes , they were given the court 's authority to subpoena witnesses and compel them to testify . That power remains today , even though the jurors no longer decide on their own whom to call and what questions to ask . That is now the prosecu ? tor 's role , yet judges who should know better tend to treat the prosecutor 's actions as if they were taken at the command of the grand jurors . It is such " investigatory " grand juries that the Jus ? tice Department lawyers assembled in Los Angeles and Boston to look into the distribution of the Penta ? gon Papers . Using the subpoena power of the grand jury , federal prosecutors compelled newsmen , aca ? demics and even senatorial aides to appear and be asked questions about the Pentagon Papers . ( The very same grand jury which subpoenaed Samuel Popkin also served its writ on Senator Mike Gravel 's assistant to ask him where the senator had gotten his copy of the Papers and how he arranged to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to injury by concluding ? notwithstanding the solicitor general 's concession to the contrary ? that even Senator Gravel himself could be forced to testify on these subjects . ) Can there be any real doubt that the power to com ? pel witnesses to appear and testify in so sweeping an investigation could be abused by aggressive , ambi ? tious and determined young prosecutors ? Would the courts as readily confer that power on prosecutors alone to conduct investigations in their own offices without the 23 citizens who convened , at the prose ? cutor 's call , from time to time in the Post Office build ? ing in Boston ? If not , should the prosecutors have that authority simply because they gather together 23 citi ? zens to hear the questions they ask and the answers given by the witnesses ? The Popkin case boils down to another illustration of the trend in the current Department of Justice to ar ? rogate to itself unreviewable powers . The courts have occasionally rejected these attempts ? most notably when the department maintained that on its own eval @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pro 20 hibit publication of the Pentagon Papers or install wiretaps and bugs . Unfortunately , in the reporter 's privilege cases , as in Dr. Popkin 's , the courts set up no meaningful procedure to supervise prosecutors ' in ? terrogations before grand juries . This leaves witnesses such as reporters and scholars ? whose interests are often more public than private ? to the less-than-ten ? der mercies of government lawyers . The lesson taught by Dr. Popkin 's week in jail was , therefore , not that scholars must divulge confidential sources ; if anything , the decision of the court of ap ? peals protected the identity of secret informants within THE NEW REPUBLIC the government ( although it jeopardized the privacy of discussions among scholars ) . What Dr. Popkin learned , as he announced at a press conference on his release , was that " there is an incredible bag of tricks that go with grand juries . " The most useful trick as any amateur magician knows ? is not to let those around you know what you are really about . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Most are addicts who support their habit by committing crimes such as burglary , prostitution and robbery . A $40 or $50 a day heroin habit would require $150-$200 in stolen property to sustain the addict for a single day . It is estimated that half of all property crimes in New York City are committed by narcotics addicts . The cost to the nation in property losses is several billion dollars a year . The human costs are incalculable . Every year more than a million kilograms of opium are illicitly harvested . Most of it is grown and con ? sumed in Asia , but about a fifth of the crop is thought to enter the international market . Worldwide heroin seizures this year are expected to account for about four percent of the crop , which is 20 percent of the heroin in international traffic . These seizures have had an effect in the United States on the availability ( low ) , price ( high ) and quality ( poor ) of heroin on the streets . One government official involved in control ? ling illicit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before more of the world 's illicit opium finds its way here through new channels . A recent General Accounting Office study on inter ? national narcotics trafficking notes : " The illegality of heroin is the sole reason for its high cost in this coun ? try ; in England the pharmacy cost is $0.04 per grain compared with a US street price of from $30 to $90 per grain . " If alcoholics can get their " fix " at neighbor ? hood bars or liquor stores which in many places are state-operated , why , some ask , should n't narcotics addicts be able to " pick their poison " at local pharma ? cies ? Legalizing heroin would destroy its profitability and almost certainly lead to the end of illicit traffick ? ing , much as the 21st Amendment knocked out boot ? legging in " wet " states . Taking the profit out of the heroin trade , however , would probably not lower its use . On the contrary , there is reason to believe the reverse would be true and that legalized or clinically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drug and becoming addicted to it . Heroin maintenance would require high doses administered three or four times a day . It is foolish to expect an addict to make multiple visits to a clinic and at the same time be able to lead anything like a " normal " life . Permitting take-home doses would result in increased experimentation by new users of the addict 's acquaintance . " Heroin addic ? tion is analogous to an infectious epidemic , " says Dr. Peter Bourne , the former director of Georgia 's nar ? cotics treatment programs who is now an assistant director of the Special Action Office for Drug Abuse Prevention ( SAODAP ) . " It spreads by face to face contact among friends . One addict , a Vietnam veteran , told me he had gotten 50 people started on heroin since his return . " The dope pusher , contrary to legend , is more of a local merchant than an initiator of young innocents . Bourne is hopeful heroin contagion can be              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
