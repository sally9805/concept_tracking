MOE BERG : ATHLETE , SCHOLAR , SPY by LOUIS KAUFMAN , BARBARA FITZGERALD and TOM SEWELL 274 pages . Little , Brown . $7.95 . <P> <P> In the fall of 1934 , as members of America 's touring all-star baseball team arrived at Tokyo Station , crowds of Japanese fans began to cheer : " Banzai , Babe Ruth ! Banzai , Lou Gehrig ! Banzai , Jimmy Foxx ! . . . Banzai , Moe Berg ! " <P> Moe Berg ? <P> It is astonishing that in a sport whose devoted followers can recall such trivia as Fenton Mole 's lifetime batting average , the name Moe Berg seems all but forgotten . Casey Stengel called him " the strangest fellah who ever put on a uniform . " The strange thing was that Berg played major league baseball at all . Unlike Stengel , who it is said became a ballplayer after discovering that he was a lefthanded dentistry student in a world of righthanded dental equipment , Berg was suited to do just about anything . He had an IQ that could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 243 . He was competent in a dozen languages , including Latin and Sanskrit . He held a law degree and even practiced for a few off-seasons on Wall Street . He was charming , good-looking , witty and a connoisseur of wine , women and string quartets . He kept a tuxedo in his locker . He was also a bit mysterious . <P> A-Bomb Race . Just how mysterious is now told in this biography , which claims that Moe Berg was not only the smartest man who ever wore spikes but also the U.S. 's most important atomic spy during World War II . Working for OSS in Switzerland and behind enemy lines , Berg gathered information that determined Germany 's progress toward building a nuclear bomb . He was also able to learn the whereabouts of labs and reactors and the identities of Hitler 's leading atomic scientists . The authors raise the possibility that Berg may even have assassinated a few , and that he had orders to kill Werner Heisenberg during a lecture visit to Switzerland if the great German physicist was discovered to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never spoke of his spy experiences to friends or relatives , and he refused to detail his OSS missions even for Government records . His secrets were probably lost forever when , inMay 1972 , Berg died at the age of 70 from injuries suffered in a fall at his bachelor apartment in Newark , N.J. <P> Berg grew up in that city , the son of an immigrant Russian Jewish pharmacist . At Princeton , he excelled in romance languages and stopping balls as the varsity shortstop . Berg lacked confidence that he could make it in the majors , but he reasoned that baseball was the most enjoyable way to earn enough money to study phonetics at the Sorbonne . The Brooklyn Dodgers , who probably thought Berg had said something about liking sour buns , offered him a $5,000 contract . <P> As a rookie in 1923 , Berg proved to be a great glove , a slow runner and a weak bat . The standard line on Moe was that he could speak many languages but could n't hit in any of them . But as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boston Red Sox , he made a place for himself in the major leagues . " I spent years attempting to master a number of foreign languages , " he said , " and what happens ? I turn out to be a catcher and am reduced to sign language on the ballfield.
