txt In the face of Israel 's refusal to respond to U.S. pressure on the Palestinian question , the United States seems to have chosen the well-worn path of " maintaining diplomatic movement " rather than confrontation with Prime Minister Menachem Begin . state Department officials indicate that the next step for the United States in the Middle East is likely to be a trip to the area by Alfred L. Atherton Jr. , the department 's roving Middle East envoy , or by Secretary of State Cyrus Vance himself . Such a trip would have as one main purpose encouraging President Anwar al-Sadat of Egypt to stay with the " peace process . " The initial low-key response on the part of the United States to Israel 's hard line on the question of Palestinian self-determination and the future of the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip seems , in fact , to be based on an assessment that President Sadat is unlikely to embark on any dramatic change of course within the next few months . State Department officials noted with some relief that the initial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ East was " quite restrained . " But other Middle East experts , both inside and outside the U.S. Government , stressed that President Sadat is unlikely to stand still in the face of what the Egyptian leader must regard as Israeli intransigence . At the very least , they say , he will press the U.S. to produce publicly an " American plan " for peace in the Middle East . In the Egyptian view , this would create inexorable pressure on Israel to respond more positively on the key issues . " We 've always said that at some point we might come forth with suggestions , " said a State Department official when asked about the possibility of the U.S. going public with its ideas on a Middle East peace settlement . " But nothing at all has been decided on this . " In the meantime , State Department officials indicate that one should watch for pressures building up on Prime Minister Begin 's government within Israel itself .

During this period the Palestinians in the territories would be given a form of limited " self-rule . " The U.S. apparently hoped that a positive response from Israel on this question would lead to a renewal of the direct Egyptian-Israeli peace talks , which broke down in January , although some officials say that they were not surprised by the Israeli decision to avoid any commitment . UN resolve abandoned While the State Department steadfastly re-fused in its public statements to " character-ize " Israel 's response to President Carter 's questions , some officials privately admitted that the Israelis were in effect repudiating United Nations Resolution 242 , which calls for Israeli withdrawal from occupied territories . Previous Israeli governments have accepted Resolution 242 , but Prime Minister Begin has indicated that in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The National Association of Arab Americans , a pro-Arab group representing the interests of Americans of Arab ancestry , issued a statement June 19 that reflected concern that Israel now considers the U.S. to be a " paper tiger " on key Middle East issues . " The choice is clear , " the Arab group 's statement said . " A definite challenge has been made by Israel . The next move by President Carter will be decisive . We hope it will be the right move .
