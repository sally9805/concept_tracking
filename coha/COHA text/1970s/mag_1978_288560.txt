" You 've got two different kinds of people in Sadat and Begin , " one of President Jimmy Carter 's close aides observed last week . " Begin is hung up on history and the nuances in every word . Sadat could n't care less about all that crap.What he wants is to get on with a peace settlement . " <P> The nuances of every word have proved discouraging to Egypt 's President Anwar Sadat over the past month or more . Though the ministerial-level talks between Egyptians and Israelis were revived last week , the two countries are still far apart on the overall " statement of principles " that Sadat feels is necessary as a framework for Middle East peace negotiations . And though the Israelis talked of being willing to negotiate all disputed issues , they keep pressing forward with their policy of establishing illegal settlements in the occupied territories of the West Bank and the Sinai ( see WORLD ) . <P> In a new effort to " boost the momentum for peace , " Sadat set out last week on what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of support-diplomatic , military and moral . " A heavy and difficult job lies ahead , " he said . His main destination , of course , after a brief stopover in Morocco , was Washington . Secretary of State Cyrus Vance was on hand , along with the red-uniformed Marine Band , to welcome the Egyptian leader to Andrews Air Force Base late Friday afternoon . Sadat , accompanied by his elegant wife , Jihan , his 21-year-old son , Gamal , and two of his six daughters , Noha , 20 , and Jihan , 17 , saluted the American Secretary , then ducked into an Air Force helicopter for the hop to the South Lawn of the White House . There Jimmy Carter rushed to embrace him . In a brief statement , Sadat quickly disclosed his main concern , warning firmly against any " rigidity " or " fanaticism " that might interrupt " the holy march on the road to peace . " He urged that the U.S. become " the arbiter . " <P> That same evening , the two Presidents helicoptered to the seclusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seven previous U.S. Presidents have sought diplomatic privacy with other world leaders . The press was barred , and even Washington 's eager officialdom was reduced to a select handful. * Carter and Sadat had some 50 hours available for candid and unfettered discussion .
