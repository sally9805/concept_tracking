Carter 's very modest exercise <P> The purpose of the journey , said National Security Adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski , is to " respond to the new realities in foreign policy and the appearance of new and important countries in the world . " It was a windy way to describe the 15,000-mile four-country tour that Jimmy Carter begins this week . Actually , there was little else to say , for the very good reason that nothing much is expected from the seven-day excursion beyond some small gains in good will and a little broadening of the presidential horizons . <P> Carter 's latest foray-to Venezuela , Brazil , Nigeria and Liberia-is a kind of footnote to the grueling nine-day , 18,500-mile global marathon he embarked upon in December . Planned by Brzezinski , that mammoth jaunt was supposed to include three of the four countries Carter will now visit . They were lopped off the itinerary when someone realized that the President-or any other mortal-would have trouble keeping up the pace of such a tour . Having promised a visit to Venezuela , Brazil and Nigeria , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Liberia was added more or less as an afterthought . <P> After leaving on Tuesday , Carter was to stop first in Caracas . He will hold at least two private meetings with President Carlos Andrs Prez . Topics are expected to include the Panama Canal treaties ; human rights ( Venezuela has one of the best Latin American records in that field ) ; and undoubtedly , since that country is a member of OPEC , oil . <P> Relations between the U.S. and Venezuela are generally good , but Carter could have a trickier time of it in Rio de Janeiro . Brazil 's military government was angered when the U.S. unsuccessfully tried to block the sale of West German nuclear reactors to Brazil . Nor does Brazil like Carter 's position on human rights , which is considerably at variance with the generals ' view of how to run things . <P> When Carter lands in the Nigerian capital of Lagos , the talk will turn to geo-political issues . The President considers Nigeria to be a key mediator in African security problems , especially in southern Africa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has taken a strong stand in favor of peaceful accession to black majority rule in the white-dominated southern region . <P> Carter 's visit to Monrovia , the capital of Liberia , is more of a stopover : 3 hours long . Still , it will be the first by a U.S. President since Franklin D. Roosevelt 's 1943 visit after a conference with Winston Churchill in Casablanca . The main topic for lunchtime discussion with President William R. Tolbert Jr . is likely to be regional economic cooperation . <P> All in all , the trip is a very modest exercise-but probably less taxing than dealing with that other foreign power in Carter 's life , the U.S. Congress .
