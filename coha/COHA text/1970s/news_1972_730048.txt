txt The youth vote packs political punch , but campaigners are n't sure how much . Right now they 're sparring with shadows . The shadows are the young voters who will be eligible to cast ballots in a Presidential election for the first time this the country , including at least 200,000 in Illinois . Most Not in School What makes the youth vote a shadowy target is its ill-defined profile . There are no election records to scout for their past voting performance . So far , most publicity about young voters has centered on campus , especially at so-called prestige schools . Yet 7 young voters out of 10 attend neither high school nor college . They work in factories , filling stations , depar tment stores , and on trucks . They fill gas tanks , not classrooms , and they 're likely to dread the month 's bills as some students dread the semester 's grades . Members of the nonstudent bloc make a hard-to-pin-down quarry for the vote-seeker . No student union pulls them together . They 're away from the campus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place with different problems . They 're students of experience , not theory , and they 're reading their issues from a pragmatic text . Many have families to support . Half of the women and almost one-third of the men in their age group are married . Others lack jobs . They 're more concerned with battling the budget at home than fighting the war in Viet Nam . War Not the Issue " Nixon 's taking care of the war , " said Donna Shilney , 20 , as she leaned on a pinball machine in a Near North bar . What bothers her are high prices and low wages . " Jobs just are n't opening up , and they do n't pay well , " she said . A clerk in a Loop credit bureau , she said it took her two months to find her job , and only then thru an employment agency . Watching television on the other side of the room , Mrs. Kit Timpone , 22 , an airline stewardess , echoed the same theme . " The economy is messed up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It does n't seem to be getting anywhere ? no matter how many phases Nixon puts it thru . " Such remarks were typical of those aired by dozens of new young voters interviewed last week in Chicago . They seemed more concerned with jobs and price tags than Viet Nam or China . Voice Skepticism Of course the war still hits close to home for some , especially the draft-age young men . Troop levels may be down , they say , but we 're still in Viet Nam . " The war convinced me that nobody does what they say after they 're elected , " said John Kranak , who 's more interested in getting work as a body-andfender man than in turning 18 in time for the election . " If they draft me , I 'll go , " the West Sider said , " but I wo n't vote . I 'll just go along with things because voting wo n't do any good . You ca n't believe what the politicians say . " Resents " Pigeonholing " Some things that politicians say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supervisor from the South Side . " They keep trying to pigeonhole us with fad issues , " tie said , - just whatever happens to be ' right on ' at the time . " They 've never bothered to check with us on anything before , and they seem to take it for granted that anyone under 21 has a limited mind . They think we 'll believe anything they tell us . " The nation 's leaders should turn their efforts from international battlefields toward the home front , many young people say . Nancy Brislen. 18 , a waitresscashier in Scoopy 's Ice Cream Parlor , : 3131 N. Broadway , thinks the nation should look out for its own people first . " We have enough to do at home instead of spending so much money overseas , " she said . " We should do a better job of educating people so they can get off welfare and into jobs where they 'll take pride in themselves . " The issues are there , but the nonstudent young who will be voting on them are a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I do n't see them const3'ering themselves as a separate and distinct group , as their college counterparts do , " said William Colson , the campaign chairman for Paul Simon , who is seeking the Democratic gubernatorial nomination . Not Easily Analyzed " I do n't see the nonstudent youth as a bloc . I see it as a substratum of the society with pulls from both directions . They probably land somewhere ber ween their parents and their college counterparts . " Caught between the iconoclasm of youth and the conservatism of the working class , they rarely fit into neat political categories . As a group , however , they seem more conservative than students . A Gallup Poll for Newsweek. for instance , showed that 49 per cent of the young workers sampled had identified themselves as " middle-of-the-road , " as compared with 38 per cent of the students . Only 22 ' Liberal Some 22 per cent referred to themselves as " liberal or radical , " while 43 per cent of the students so labeled themselves . Twenty-one per cent called themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counterpart among students . Despite their number , however , the nonstudent vote is not expected to have the impact it could . The less educated a person is. the less likely he is to vote , the experts say .
