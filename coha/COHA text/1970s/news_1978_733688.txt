txt Who stays , who goes ? What is fat , what is muscle ? Is one man 's frill another man 's privilege ' Californians in more than 500 cities , more than 1,000 school districts and hundreds of special taxation districts are asking themselves these questions , and they do not have much time to come up with the answers . An examination of the values and priorities of local government that is mere sweeping than any previous such effert is under way in the wake of the passage Tuesday of Proposition 13 . Reaction Called ' Unreal ' By limiting property taxes through the state constitutional amendment , the proposition in a single stroke slashed the total income of local governments in the fiscal year beginning July 1 by more than 22 percent on the average . And for some communities and school districts that depend heavily upon the property tax , it reduced income by as much as 70 percent . The smaller tax pie will be divided under an allocation law di ? State Legislature has yet to enact , and a hitter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involves different levels and agencies of government , competing special : nterest groups and bureaucrats as rivals for survival . " It 's unreal the way people are reacting to this , " said Robert Riley , the city manContinued ager of  --  Redondo Beach , a southern Californla coastal community of 65,000 people , one of more than 5,000 units of government that are facing the agony of deciding what is essential and what is expendable . " Everybody says , ' Why cut my special interest program and not his ? ' and there 's a tremendous amount of cynicism , " Mr. Riley said . " People do n't believe me when I say we 've got to cut out S7 people . " At least one public opinion poll before the vote concluded that the item of governmental spending that Californians most wanted to trim was welfare . With the help of a large cash surplus , the state is likely to assume this burden from the cities and counties . However , state officials say that Federal law prevents them from actually reducing the $4.9 billion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ment costs will have to come from other areas . And because personnel costs typically make up more than 75 percent of the cost of most elements of local government , this means people . The decision being faced around the state is which people and which programs should go . Social Services May Be Cut Although there has not been time enough since Tuesday for most of the communities to develop final plans , the cities so far have tended to give highest priority to police and fire protection , refuse collection and water and sewer service , while cutting out such functions as parks and recreation and social services . The initial reductions announced by school systems have involved summer sessions and adult education programs . while county governments have tended to stress cuts in health and hospital services and recreation . One segment of government that has been especially hard-hit by the new law is the state 's 524 fire districts , most of which get all their income from property taxes , for which no substitute seems available . While only the first wave of cutbacks has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rival segments of government . In Los Angeles , fo.r example , some police department officials are known to he furious over a city proposal not to reduce the number of full-time firemen ; they contend that all departments should be treated equally in the cutbacks . And a group of museum employees has sued the County Board of Supervisors , arguing that they are being made to accept a disproportionate share of the reductions . Some See Racial Overtones In some communities the dispute has racial overtones . Leaders of black and Mexican-American groups contend that minorities will he disproportionately affected by cutbacks because they often have ' lie least seniority . Indeed , one analysis of possible layoffs in Los Angeles indicates that more than 60 percent of the affected people are members of minorey groups . Seniot ity provisions have also touched of : disputa. ; between older and younger emplevees. and both minorities and younger workers are pushing for a lottery system rather than seniority regulations to determine who is laid off . In efforts to defeat Proposition 1:1 , many local political . and educational leaders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realities of the new law have begun to set in , some of those forecasts have been modi-fied Lo Angeles County officials have predicta. ' ! se:offs of 37,000 people , but yesterciny this estimate was reduced to a range of 10,000 to 20,000 . Schools to Cut Programs Pespec large budget cuts , a number of school districts said they expected to survive without laying off large numbers of full-time teachers , concentrating their cuts in programs of apparently limited interest . One trustee of the Los Angeles district , Bobbie Fiedler , asserted at a news conference yesterday that if " fat and luxuries " were cut from the operating budget of the nation 's second-largest school system , no teachers need be laid off , The district has contended that it would have to furlough two-thirds of its 30,000 teachers . Mrs. Fiedler also noted that estimates of Proposition 13 losses by the districts announced before the election of $750 million had now been reduced to $200 million . Nevertheless , it is becoming clear that many thousands of public employees in California will be deferred in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surplus of almost $5 billion will be diverted to help . The timeliness of their discharge , the officials say , will he accelerated by a Federal law that increases the cost to local governments for payment of unemployment benefit insurance for persons laid off after July 1 . Pointing to a recent decline in enrollment , some Proposition 13 advocates had called for sharp reductions in school budgets . Teachers ' unions are strongly resisting the proposals to cut staffs and defer wage iricreases . And administrators say there is less they can do to reduce expenses than some outsiders believe , partly because of state laws that set work and wage standards that apply to teachers . . " Itsounds like all you have to do is cut off the globs of fat that are hanging off this beast , " said James Riewer , the Superintendent of the South Bay Union High School District here , whose income has been slashed almost in half by Proposition 13 . But he noted that many of the district 's expenditures and personnel costs were mandated by slate law , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be discharged according to seniority . " It 's sickening , " Mr. Riewer said . " I had to go out and face 120 of our best teachers  --  the best in terms of youth , vigor and excitement in a classroom ? and tell them they have to go . " Mr. Riley , the City Manager here , said he had developed a new budget providing for a 23 percent reduction in income , and added that the public would have to get used to different expectations from their government . ' Police , fire and public works will ge given priority , " he said , " and anything that can be logically assumed by the citizens  --  crossing guards , social services , things like that  --  will be transferred to citizens . " " It 's also a challenge , " Mr. Riley added . " You 're turning back to the community and saying , ' Hey , it 's your turn now . ' If this thing does work , it will be because the citizen will get involved . "  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
