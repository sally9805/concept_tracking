txt Wholesale prices , paced by a renewed spurt in food prices , rose sharply again in May , and unemployment once again failed to decline . Monthly figures made public today by the Labor Department showed that the Wholesale Price Index rose six-tenths of 1 per cent in May , or one-half of 1 per cent when the effects of normal seasonal changes were eliminated from the figures . The rise brought the index to 118.2 on a scale in which 1967 prices are taken as 100 . The unemployment rate remained at 5.9 per cent of the labor force , the same as in the two preceding months . The rate has hovered just above or below 6 per cent since December , 1970 . Biggest Part of Rise The rise in the prices of farm products , processed foods and feed , which amounted to 1.4 per cent , or eight-tenths of 1 per cent after seasonal adjustment , was by far the heaviest contributor to the rise in the over-all Wholesale Price Index . The increase in food prices in May followed two months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Wholesale Price Index is , however , the trend in prices of industrial commodities , which is not influenced so much by weather and other noneconomic factors as are food prices . The wholesale prices of industrial commodities rose fourtenths of 1 per cent in the month , thus continuing the pattern of the preceding four months . The continued steady climb of industrial commodity prices reflects ' ' a problem , " Dr. Herbert Stein , chairman of President Nixon 's Council of Economic Advisers , acknowledged . More Than a " Bulge " Administration economists had hoped that the rise in the prices of industrial commodities in recent months merely reflected a catch-up of price adjustments that had to be postponed last summer and fall because of the price freeze , This was the " bulge " that Administration officials said they had expected . The fact that the price increases have persisted into the sixth post-freeze month indicated , however , something more than the " bulge " was at work . Various officials have said that , if the increases continued past April , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demonstrate that the freeze and the ensuing wageprice controls program had not succeeded in breaking the inBationary cycle . The one piece of relatively optimistic news concerning dnRation among the day 's statistics , was the calculation of what was happening to wage rates that is published as part of the employment and unemployment figures . The Labor Department 's new index of hourly earnings of nonsupervisory workers on private payrolls rose only three-tenths of 1 per cent in May against six-tenths in April . For the 12 months from May , 1971 , to last month , the rise was 5.8 per cent , which is not so far from the 5.5 per cent annual rise ' in wage rates that has been established as the noninflationary standard under the wage-price controls program . Teen-Age Rate Falls Although the over-all unemployment rate was unchanged in May , there were some diverse movements within the total . The unemployment rate for adult women rose to 5.9 per cent from 5.4 and the rate for teen-agers dropped to 15.7 per cent from 17.3 . The rate for adult men was unchanged at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like the rate for teen-agers , fluctuates a good bit because of the smallness of the size of the sample , rose to 10.7 per cent from 9.6 , thus once again hitting a level about twice that of white unemployment , which was 5.3 per cent . Over all , there were 81,205 , - 000 people at work in May and 5,072,000 out of work and looking for it , on the seasonally adjusted basis . The size of the labor force , consisting of those at work or looking for work , rose by 202 , - 000 in May , thus continuing a pattern of somewhat largerthan-usual increases in the work force . Since May , 1971 , the size . of the civilian work force has risen by 2.2 million and the number of people at work , by 2.3 million . Foresees a Decline Dr. Stein said that such large increases in the work force would have to stop sometime ? " You run out of people , " he said  --  and that the unemployment rate would then start to decline . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In percentage of work force 6,5 The Now York Time ' Juno 3,1972 Wholesale Price Index All commodities 1967=100 lie . The New York Thus Juno 3,1972 that the unemployment rate would ' be " in the neighborhood of 5 per cent " by the end of this year . Other economist disputed Dr. Stein 's emphasis on the rise in the work force , saying that , while it was somewhat larger than usual , an increase of more than two million was to be expected . One strong sign in the employment figures was the continued rise in employment in manufacturing , which amounted to 92,000 jobs last month . This was accompanied by a somewhat unexpected decline in the average weekly hours worked in manufacturing to 40.5 from 40.8 . Hours worked in manufacturing is generally considered a " leading indicator " of economic activity , which goes up or down before the economy generally . In this instance , it appeared possible that the decline in hours reflected a confident feeling on the part of manufacturing employers that the upturn in their business was permanent and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work the existing staff overtime .
