 | gotten further along in this demanding world than Thatcher . The Sloan was a mighty institution , with resources rivaled only by the great superpowers . It was not the perch from which to view Wall Street with detachment . Especially when the Dow Jones average has just dropped thirty points in one week . It was John Thatcher 's private theory that during such major downward shifts , the financial community as a whole went slightly and temporarily insane . Orders went undischarged . Syndicates fell apart . Drinking men went on the wagon and abstainers swilled four martinis before lunch . Whenever four hundred thousand shares of any blue chip had to be sold in the third market , virtually all of Thatcher 's colleagues developed alarming aberrations . It was Thatcher 's custom during such trying intervals to seek out the exceptions . In practice , he reflected as he fought his way up ' William Street against a bitter cutting wind and a tide of office-bent secretaries , this meant that market crises often found him lunching with Stanton Carruthers . Carruthers was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) as viewed from Carruthers &; Carruthers were momentous matters , measured by a stately concept of time ? namely , the generation . Frequently to the fourth and fifth . Men who think in terms of generations are not given to fits and starts . Whether the profession made the man , or the man found the profession , Stanton Carruthers , whom Thatcher found awaiting him at The Coachman , was reassuringly free from the tics afflicting everybody else these days . A tall man with meticulous manners , he was a compendium of sober virtues . IIc did not ask for the inside story on why the American Exchange had suspended trading in Roote Industries , or even about the Tallahassee Fund 's bizarre selling patterns . " Good to see you , John , " he said , unfolding a napkin and scanning the menu with perfunctory interest .  | Thatcher replied appropriately . After the ritual of ordering , Stanton Carruthers continued in kind . " I understand you 're in charge these days , " he said . " Yes indeed , " said Thatcher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trust . " Where 's George ? " Carruthers inquired . How wise he had been to choose Carruthers , Thatcher congratulated himself . Almost no one on the financial side of the street could have refrained from witticism at this juncture . Not with the averages still sliding toward ten-year lows . For Thatcher became acting president of the bank only in the absence of his two superiors  --  Bradford Withers , president , and George C. Lancer , chairman of the board . Withers was a notorious peripatetic . He was at the moment , for reasons not clear to Thatcher , in Ulan Bator . George , thank God , was a dedicated banker with a high sense of duty . Trust Stanton Carruthers to make things easy . " George , " Thatcher was able to reply , " is in ' Washington , testifying before Wright Patman . " Carruthers resisted even this temptation . Of course , there were those who claimed that witticism on any subject did not tempt Carruthers . Certainly , the ensuing conversation could not be described as scintillating . Nevertheless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after all , when absolute predictability has its charms . As a man and as a banker , John Putnam Thatcher should have remembered that there is no such thing as absolute predictability . Refreshed , Thatcher returned to his office , ready to resume battle . He was prepared for anguished cries from each and every one of his subordinates . He was prepared for rapid deterioration in the Investment Division . He was even prepared for apocalyptic visions in Commercial Loan .  | He was not prepared for a subpoena on his desk . " Francis P. Omara vs . Joseph , Cardinal Devlin , " he read aloud . " What the devil . . . ? " Miss Corsa , his secretary , who was a faithful daughter of her church , looked at him disapprovingly . Thatcher felt moved to defend himself . " I have no idea what this is about , Miss Corsa . Do we have any memos on the subject ? " " I do not believe so , " she replied coldly . It should not have been necessary to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought against His Eminence , the Roman Catholic Archbishop of New York , were not likely to have escaped her attention . Nevertheless , Miss Corsa made a rapid review of the items that George C. Lancer had referred to Mr. Thatcher 's attention . " No , Mr. Thatcher , " she announced after a few moments . " Shall I check around ? " " Please do , " said Thatcher politely . Naturally , he could not foresee where this was going to lead . He was , however , given a reasonable foretaste by his incomparably disinterested secretary . Miss Corsa returned with information and a series of appointments superseding his existing appointments . Since Miss Corsa had a rigid sense of priorities , Thatcher saw that she , at least , regarded Francis P. Omara vs . Joseph , Cardinal Devlin as worthier of attention than the imminent collapse of the stock market . " The Sloan , " she announced as preliminary to her subsequent report , " is financing the purchase of a parochial grade school . St. Bernadette 's  --  in Flensburg . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Law Department will brief you at three . Public Relations will call when they have finished getting background material ... " Predictably , neither Real Estate nor Law could match Miss Corsa 's conciseness . Nevertheless , by ruthlessly dam-  | fining a flood of technical information concerning assessed valuations and zoning ordinances , Thatcher managed to obtain some facts . The Sloan was indeed involved in the purchase of St. Bernadette 's Parochial School . This was not the way that the Real Estate Department liked to think of the transaction . The Archdiocese of New York proposed to sell a parcel of land in Queens to the Unger Realty Corporation , an old and valued Sloan client . This land , encompassing ninety thousand square feet , was intended by Unger Realty as the site for a high-rise apartment complex . The Sloan was providing mortgage money , to the tune of four million dollars . Sloan experts , from architects to appraisers , had examined everything with a fine-toothed comb . " . .. first-rate location , near the subway , " said Llewellyn with dusty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was , so costs wo n't be exorbitant . And there will be a substantial increase in value when Unger is finished . It 's a sweet proposition . " " Yes indeed , " said Thatcher . " But why does it involve us in a lawsuit , Llewellyn ? For that matter , what is this lawsuit about ? " In many ways , Llewellyn was a limited man . " It is not a matter of title , " he said stiffly . Thatcher had never doubted this . There was one thing to be said about Sloan mortgages : their purity of title was virginal . " Parents ! " said Stetson from the Law Department . " There 's a parents group out there , protesting the closing of the school . I just called Ericson . He 's filed for an injunction to stop the sale of the land . I do n't know anything about religious law , but he 's attacking the theory that a parish school belongs to the Archbishop . We 're being summoned as witnesses . " " Ericson ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Parents League , Stetson explained . He then added : " Ericson 's one of Stan Carruthers ' partners . " " Hmm , " said Thatcher . " That 's the only thing that makes me think there may be something in this , " said Stetson airily , ignoring Llewellyn 's tendency to bristle . " This kind of nuisance suit is usually some bunch of nuts , with an ambitious lawyer trying to make a name for himself . But God only knows why Ericson 's doing it . " Miss Corsa took an altogether graver view . No sooner had Thatcher 's office been cleared , than she was back . " The public relations people have not found anything yet , " she said . " You surprise me , " Thatcher told her . But Miss Corsa was not deflected . " Miss Bellotti , " she told her employer , " who works in Statistical Typing , comes from Flensburg . " " All ha ! " said Thatcher . It was nice to know that the Sloan 's information sources were not limited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Bellotti say ? " IIc heard Miss Corsa 's rendition of the Bellotti version . Miss Bellotti , a newcomer to the Sloan , had not felt equal to reporting directly . She was , he gathered , a giddy young thing . Filtering giddiness through Miss Corsa was always excellent procedure . Flensburg , in the borough of Queens , was thirty-five minutes by subway from midtown Manhattan , a neighborhood not so homogeneous as it had once been , but still a community of modest comfort . For generations , St. Bernadette 's Church and St. Bernadette 's School had contributed to thtit sense of community . " Gee , " Miss Bellotti had said , " I went there myself ! " " I see , " said Thatcher .  | Four months ago , church authorities had announced that rising costs and the familiar financial squeeze would force closing of the school by the end of the school year . There was unhappiness throughout the parish with this decision . But unhappiness turned to anger one week later . The Archdiocese had then announced that Unger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buildings and construct a twenty-story apartment house . " That , " Miss Bellotti had said gleefully , " really got everybody going ! " Earlier protests hardened . An organization instantly formed . Night after night there were meetings of parents . People distributed handouts at the subway entrance during rush hour . Since there were no colleges or universities in the Flensburg area , this was the first organized dissent the community had witnessed . It was , or so Miss Bellotti said , really kind of exciting . " Thank you very much , Miss Corsa , " said Thatcher when she had finished . Miss Corsa said demurely that he was welcome . And also , Mr. Unger was on the line . Thatcher watched her depart with uplifted eyebrow . He did not resent being stage-managed on occasion , but he was by no means sure that this was the occasion . A nuisance suit against the Roman Catholic Church was not likely to bring that august institution to its knees . However , Miss Corsa had placed Mr. Unger on his line . It behooved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jamaica , " said the voice on the phone . " I 'm handling the St. Bernadette 's sale . " Thatcher had met Dad . Unger senior , an aggressive real estate entrepreneur , had built a small firm into one of New York 's largest . His methods had earned him a reputation as  | a rough diamond ; if he had been less successful , the description would have been different . The son , Thatcher recalled , was not a rough diamond . " Yes , we had heard that there might be some trouble , " Dick Unger went on . " But we did n't expect to get a subpoena ! " Thatcher agreed that it was unusual . Dick Unger sounded bemused . " You know , I 've talked to Frank Omara myself . He 's the chairman of this bunch of parents . You 'd think that he 'd understand the situation more than some of the others . He 's an undertaker . " " A profitable occupation , " Thatcher commented . " That 's right , " Unger said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't afford to keep the school running . And if they 're not going to operate a school , they 'd be fools to turn down a good offer for the property . It is n't as if we were planning to put up a factory . If anything , property values are going to go up once we 've built . " Thatcher agreed that this was simple logic and inquired where Francis Omara failed to follow . He elicited a muffled groan . " I ca n't really say , " said Dick Unger , baffled . " He starts talking about Catholic education ? and he loses me ! " Thatcher did not remind the young man that these were deep waters . Instead , he asked about Unger Realty 's immediate position . " We 're still counting on the sale going through , " said Unger with some of his father 's bluntness . " By the time we 've built , well , we 're hoping that all this will be a thing of the past . I do n't think a suit against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you ? " " Not unless they 've got something up their sleeves , " said Thatcher . Ile was now prepared to put St. Bernadette 's from his  | mind and concentrate on more germane matters . But Miss Corsa was not through with him yet . " Mr. Ericson , " she announced , " will meet you at The Coachman for lunch tomorrow . " She was not shaken by Thatcher 's silent reproof . " Miss Corsa , " he said solemnly , " if anybody in this bank should require my attention on any subject other than a parochial school , will you be good enough to refer them to Trinkam ? " Without blinking , Miss Corsa assured him this would be done . It left him with an uneasy feeling that Miss Corsa saw more than he did .  | For the second day in a row , Thatcher found himself lunching at The Coachman with a lawyer . He felt that this might be interpreted as overdoing . Regrettably , it was not a commendable sense of duty that steered his thoughts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ericson . Within minutes of meeting the man , Thatcher had taken his measure . He was a fanatic . In appearance , he was a conservative Wall Street lawyer . But something about his intent gaze put Thatcher on his guard . Lunch at The Coachman was already repetitive . He could do without religious mania . By the time they had progressed to roast beef , Ericson had disabused Thatcher of his error . His fervor , it became clear , was reserved for the purely legal implications of the sale of St. Bernadette 's School . " ... Religious Corporation Act , " he said , happily spearing a potato . " Interesting , " said Thatcher . In point of fact , the Religious Corporation Act is almost totally devoid of interest .  | " Tell me , " he said hastily , before Ericson could get under way again , " does this lawsuit have any real possibility of success ? After all , as I understand it , the property does in fact belong to the Archdiocese . " " Ah ha ! " Ericson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That is precisely the point that bears inspection . Very careful inspection . Perhaps you recall the case of the Russian Orthodox Cathedral in Buffalo ? " He rattled on despite Thatcher 's firm denials . Ericson was prepared to use any comment as launching pad for a lecture on esoteric points of law in regard to religious institutions . It occurred to Thatcher that combining this legal virtuosity with Miss Bellotti 's excitement might spell trouble . And a four-million-dollar mortgage is a four-million-dollar mortgage . " What was that ? " Ericson barked . The only way to get a word in was to bulldoze through . Thatcher repeated his question . " Yes indeed , " said Willard Ericson keenly . " We have very good reason to believe that we can delay this sale long enough for our purposes . " ' What , Thatcher inquired , were those purposes ? " To prevent the sale to Unger , " Ericson said . " With a long enough delay , Unger will certainly have to look elsewhere . That will put an entirely different complexion on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a strong possibility that the courts will ... " To do the man justice , he was totally without malice as he enthusiastically outlined schemes to thwart the Roman Catholic Church , Unger Realty and the Sloan Guaranty Trust . " And your . . . er . . . clients ? " Thatcher interpolated . " Is a delay going to be enough to satisfy them ? " He should have known better . Ericson might be a legal philosopher-king , but he was not the man to provide useful  | insights into the parish of St. Bernadette 's or its up-in-arms parents . " Oh , I think so , " he said vaguely . " One thing I 'll say for them . They 're a very determined lot . " " Splendid , " said Thatcher heartily . He was always willing to enlarge his experience . But it was a shame he was stuck with Ericson on Wall Street . The action , or so Ericson led him to believe , was elsewhere . In Flensburg . In Flensburg , there was no ambiguity about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that very moment one of its members , Mrs. Patricia Ianello , was earnestly outlining her position . She sat behind a battered wooden desk in a store-front office . " No , Sheila , " she was saying with rapidly rising exasperation . " This has nothing to do with married priests . Honestly ! Why do n't you just listen to what I 'm saying ? " " And then there are all these changes in the Mass . " Her companion preferred complaining to listening . " I liked the Mass the way it was . I do n't see why people have fo change everything around . " " But we do n't want to change anything ! " Pat almost howled . She glared across the desk . Sheila Macdonald had been in her class at St. Bernadette 's . Now they both had children in the first grade . In the intervening twenty years , she had never before felt any desire to choke Sheila . " Look , Sheila , it 's really very simple , " she said slowly . " You and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Sheila frowned , examined the question from every angle , and then nodded reluctantly . " And now we want Betty and Kevin to go to St. Bernadette 's , do n't we ? "  | Again that same wary agreement . " And so , " Pat concluded triumphantly , " we do n't want any changes . We want things to stay unchanged . And you are on the same side as the Parents League ! " Sheila looked startled but not downright hostile . " So there 's no reason why you should n't sign our petition . " Pat produced a long sheet of paper with two small paragraphs at the top and hundreds of signature spaces beneath . At the same time she extended a pen suggestively . Sheila closed her hands into defensive fists and said that Dan did n't hold with her signing things . Besides she did n't want to go against the Church . " This is n't going against the . . . " Pat began before braking to a sudden halt . She then took a deep breath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chance passerby . " Maybe you should take one of our pamphlets home for Dan to read . I 'm sure he 'll agree with us , once he realizes Kevin may not be able to go to St. Bernadette 's . " The mimeographed brochure was accepted , but Sheila Macdonald lingered long enough in the doorway to say dubiously that Dan was n't a great one for reading . Then she exchanged greetings with the woman entering and was gone . " Well , Pat , how did it go ? " asked the newcomer . Pat 's answer was to arch back over her chair in a huge bone-stretching yawn . Then , smacking her diaphragm sharply , she collapsed . " Ouf ! " she announced . With her slight , boyish body and scrubbed , freckled face , Pat Ianello scarcely looked old enough to qualify for a parents organization . She ran a hand through her straight light-brown hair before replying thoughtfully : " Either I 'm no good at explaining things or the people in this parish are a lot dumber than I ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You feel that way now , Pat , because it 's your first try at organizing something . You 'll get used to it . " " I 'm not sure I want to , " Pat said frankly . " Oh , come on , " was the answer . " It 's no crime to admit that people in groups are stupider than people taken one by one . " " Is that what politics teaches you ? " " Politics ! " Mary Foster snorted from the sink where she was filling a coffeepot . " It takes more than losing one race for Borough Council to make me a politician . " Pat grinned . She was not taken in by this mock modesty . Mary Foster was a big buxom woman overflowing with vitality . At forty-two she was just beginning to hit her stride . " Never mind . I 'll bet you win the next time . " " I would n't mind doing it from here . This was my campaign headquarters , you know . " Mary looked around the improvised office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of nothing but lost hopes . " Pat straightened up . " What do you mean , lost hopes ? " she asked alertly . " Do n't you think we 'll save St. Bernadette 's ? You remember what Mr. Ericson said ? " " Do n't jump down my throat ! We wo n't save it forever , that 's all I meant . Even with Ericson on our side . We 're fighting a holding action . Two or three years is all we can hope for . And to tell the truth , with my youngest boy in fifth grade , that 's all I need . " " Two or three years . " Pat was reflective . " Of course , Betty is just in the first grade and Eddie has n't even started , but Sal thinks he 'll get a new store in a couple of years and then we 'd probably have to move away . Sal says there 's no point in thinking farther ahead . " Like everyone who dealt with Pat , Mary Foster was used to hearing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said , " you did n't forget to tell him about the rally next week ? " REMOVE NOT THE OLD LANDMARK 21  | " No , I did n't forget . Sal says we can have the urn and ten pounds of coffee . " " It comes in handy , having an A &P; manager in the Parents League . " " Yes , " said Pat absently . She was staring fixedly out the front window . " This is really a very convenient location . You can see right across the street . " Mary swiveled to follow her glance . Spread before them were the visible symbols of the Roman Catholic presence in Flensburg  --  the church itself , flanked by the rectory and the parochial school and , beyond the playground , the small convent for the teaching nuns . A view both of them had seen countless times , Mary reminded herself . Why call attention to it now ? " Do you mean you can see your enemy ? " she asked uneasily . " But you like St. Bernadette @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ break a spell . Then her clear laughter floated out . " Of course that 's not it ! I mean you can see when school lets out . Which it 's doing now . Betty has to be picked up . Goodbye , it 's time I went back to work . " Of course , most of the St. Bernadette 's Parents League had been working all day . In fact Bob Horvath had already finished his seven-to-three shift as a truck driver . He was returning home when he had the bad luck to meet one of his neighbors at the elevator . " Hello , Phil , " he said unenthusiastically . Phil Kavanaugh , a dried-up little bantam , was pugnacious . " I saw your poster . For a rally about St. Bernadette 's . " " That 's right . " " You ought to be ashamed of yourselves . A lot of troublemakers , egging each other on . Father James thinks so , too . " " Have you read our pamphlet ? " " I would n't be caught reading that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Kavanaugh shifted his attack . " Is it true that you 're taking His Eminence to court ? " " You 've got it in one . " " And who are you to be setting yourselves above the Cardinal ? Has the Pope suddenly made you an archbishop ? " Horvath quelled the impulse to take Kavanaugh by the collar and chuck him down the elevator shaft . Instead he pressed the elevator button for the third time . " Lay off , Phil , " he said wearily . " Nobody cares what you think . " But whether he cared or not , Bob Horvath had the benefit of his neighbor 's opinions all the way up to the fourth floor . " That Kavanaugh is beginning to get to me , Ruthie , " he exploded to his wife . " Who the hell does he think he is , trying to tell me what school to send my kids to ? A guy that 's always been too cheap to get married himself ! " Ruthie picked up his windbreaker from the floor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Phil 's not so bad . " Horvath scowled at her . He was a firm believer that sweetness and charity were desirable characteristics in women but , honest to God , sometimes Ruthie carried things too far . " He told me himself , " Ruthie persevered , " that he stayed single for his mother 's sake . " Bob Horvath 's braying laugh could have been heard two floors away . ( It quite frequently was and had occasioned many tenant complaints . ) " Oh yeah ? And what about the time he threw the can of tomato juice at her ? " He paused dramatically . " The jumbo size ! " Francis Omara did not work to a strict schedule . As befitted one of the owners of Flensburg 's largest funeral home , he managed plenty of time off for vacations , golf and family  | outings . At the moment , however , distinguished and reassuring in a dark striped suit , he was leaving a home where he had outlined funeral arrangements . By his side was the newest curate in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Omara said briskly . " Going my way , Father ? " Omara was not being professionally heartless . Death had just come to a ninety-three-year-old great-grandmother . A display of shocked grief would have been out of place . But Father James , fresh from the seminary , found the right manner eluding him . " The family is bearing up very well , " he said in a voice that sounded priggish even to his own ears . Omara grinned . " Most people are pretty realistic , " he said , stepping out buoyantly . " My car is two blocks up . " " So is mine . " The younger man was having difficulty keeping pace . Moreover he regretted the appearance of that grin . He wanted to speak seriously and he had hoped that the background of death would create the atmosphere he might have trouble achieving himself . Gathering his courage , he went on : " I know that you 're associated with this Parents League , Mr. Omara . I think I should tell you that I can not approve of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the curate and had spent his whole life in Flensburg . The rebuke of a newly arrived priest did not overwhelm him . On the contrary , there was some danger that his amusement might be apparent . He reminded himself of the courtesies due the cloth . Cocking a quizzical eyebrow , he said soberly , " I 'm sorry to hear you say that , Father . I hope you believe that we 're only trying to do the right thing . " Like most of his contemporaries , Father James was skeptical of the moral commitment of anyone over thirty . " That 's just what I ca n't believe , " he burst out . " It 's not as if I do n't approve of lay participation in church affairs . If  | this were a matter of conscience , I 'd be the first to sympathize . But all this talk about wanting a Catholic education , when you know that you 're just trying to avoid sending your children to school with blacks . . . . It 's the hypocrisy of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with emotional outbursts . Omara 's geniality was unimpaired . " Come now , Father . We 're not all such evil sinners , " he said easily . " I 'm a prosperous man myself . I could afford to sidestep the public school , you know . But I want my children to go to St. Bernadette 's . You 're right that it 's not just a matter of Catholic education . It 's a matter of a community parish too . " Father James had not planned their talk this way . He had seen himself as magisterially reproving . The undertaker , naturally , would have lost his normal air of selfsufficient good cheer . He would have been penitent , brought to sec the duplicity of his own motives . Perhaps not immediately . Initially he might have blustered , been defensive , forgotten the respect due a priest . The last thing he was supposed to be was calmly indulgent to the enthusiasms of his curate . Father James had a dim suspicion that , to Francis Omara , he was an inexperienced boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harsh to a boy . " That is not true of most of the members of the League , " he rejoined , trying to force the issue . " I can only speak for my own motives . " If anything Omara 's tone was now even kindlier . He did , however , change the subject . " I am sorry that Father Doyle is n't able to be up and about . " " Father Doyle is in bed with the flu , " said Father James stiffly . Was he being reminded that the parish priest was the man to censure his parishioners ? Francis Omara paused by his car . His blue eyes were very bright against his deep tan . They were twinkling as he said ,  | " Father Doyle always times his bouts of the flu very well . They almost always come when he wants to avoid taking a public stand on some issue . He 's learned a Iot of wisdom in his years , Father Doyle has . " When his black Cadillac pulled away from the curb , Father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What can you do with people like that ? " he asked himself for the hundredth time . " We must remember that these people are undoubtedly very sincere , " Monsignor Miles said firmly . One look at his two companions had been enough to convince him that it would be well to make this point . They were sitting in the archdiocesan office on Madison Avenue , planning immediate tactics . The long-term strategy had been laid down by His Eminence before departure for Rome . " Sincere ? " gasped Henry Stonor , the archdiocesan public relations man . " They have filed a suit against the archdiocese ! " He was a layman , but his piety was second to no one 's . It was left to a cleric to voice a more sophisticated denunciation . " They are challenging the right of the Archbishop to dispose of church property . Think what that could lead to ! " For a moment rapt silence prevailed . Monsignor Miles was bemused by the vision of rampant laymen auctioning off St. Patrick 's . Or St. Peter 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are misguided , " he said sharply . " But I would prefer to approach them more in sorrow than in anger . Please bear in mind that we officially regard the members of the St. Bernadette 's Parents League as erring children  --  not apostates ! " His associates were obviously not persuaded . They were ,  | he was pleased to see , ready to set the parish of St. Bernadette 's a good example in the matter of obedience to spiritual superiors . Monsignor Miles relaxed his tone . " As Father Livingston has said , think where this could lead . This is exactly the problem we have to address ourselves to . If a court action really takes place , it will become a magnet for every malcontent in the archdiocese . His Eminence has directed me to make every possible effort to reason with the Parents League . " His audience stirred restively but remained silent . " I think I should meet with them . If possible , I would like to have representatives of the buyer , Unger Realty , present also . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Yes , Monsignor . " Henry Stonor leaned forward , an anxious frown on his face . " Mr. Unger himself called after being served with a subpoena . He said he was unhappy about the publicity . " " He is not the only one , " Monsignor Miles replied crisply . The dissatisfaction of Father Livingston could no longer be contained . " It 's not as if His Eminence had n't explained the situation fully to this Parents League . We gave them all he facts and figures . They can see for themselves that , with increased school populations and fewer teaching nuns , it is no longer possible to finance the school . I sometimes think these parents can not be reached by the voice of reason . " Monsignor Miles 's lean , lined face suddenly creased into a smile . " Then , dreadful as it must seem , we may have to fall back on the voice of faith .

He 's suggested that we might like to come along . " " Oh , yes ? " said Thatcher neutrally , braced to resist any suggestion that he personally represent the Sloan .

They 're having trouble reaching an agreement . " " Unless they decide on a meeting place , there can scarcely be a meeting , " Thatcher pointed out . Simple logic always seemed to be at a premium during these complex negotiations . " I think they finally understand that , " Unger said hastily . " But you see , it started with Monsignor Miles 's suggesting that they all meet here in town , at the archdiocesan 27  | office . The parents would n't go along with that  --  they said it was an attempt to overawe them with spiritual authority . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have their headquarters ?

" " Is anybody claiming that this meeting is not adversarial ? " Thatcher inquired . Dick Unger replied that it was hard to tell . He then pressed on to ask if Thatcher were willing to come . Somewhat to his own surprise , Thatcher found that he could not resist the opportunity . Not that Thatcher journeyed to Flensburg the next evening with high hopes . He knew that professional diplomats and union negotiators can husband their energy during preliminaries such as settling location , agenda and order of precedence . But amateurs , in his opinion , all too often exhausted themselves on these trivia  --  only to reach the bargaining table with additional grievances and very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

" Collectively the group is usually referred to as the Action Committee of the St. Bernadette 's Parents League , " he informed the surrounding air . " So I understand , " Father James replied . His tone convinced Thatcher , at least , that he would rather go to the stake than make any such reference . Monsignor Miles intervened . " Perhaps we could continue  | with the introductions , " he said briskly . " Mr. Omara , I believe that you have already met Mr. Unger , the purchaser of the property . And this is Mr. Thatcher , representing the Sloan Guaranty Trust . " Civil nods had been substituted for hearty handshakes . This , Thatcher knew , was a bad omen . Part of the trouble , he decided , lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rejected , agreement had been reached on St. Bernadette 's Parochial School itself . They were now assembled  --  after school hours , of course ? in a room of indeterminate character . But there were blackboards on the walls , reading primers in the sagging bookcase , and chalk dust in the air . It would not have been unbearably surprising if somebody had burst into a recitation of the multiplication table . The atmosphere was not conducive to mature deliberation . Sooner or later the parents would break . Even now , Horvath 's air of preternatural calm barely disguised subterranean rumblings . Mrs. Foster was ominously shuffling an array of statistical information . True , Mr. and Mrs. Ianello were both bright-eyed with interest . But they were sitting on chairs eight inches below the adult standard . This was bound to get on their nerves . Fortunately it was Francis Omara who first took the floor . He shared with Monsignor Miles an ability to carry his professional composure into unlikely environments . He was almost too detached . He acknowledged introductions and automatically tossed the ball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here at your request , Monsignor , but also very willingly . I wo n't deny that we 're hoping this means His Eminence has had a change of heart . " If any of his colleagues shared his hopes , it did not show . The only emotion Thatcher discerned was an involuntary nod from Willard Ericson . This , he guessed , signified approval of the opening gambit . Monsignor Miles led from strength . " I am afraid that is  | not the case , and it would be wrong of me to encourage any such possibility . There can be no change in Cardinal Devlin 's position . He very carefully considered all aspects of this situation before leaving for Rome . I assure you that it was with the greatest reluctance that he came to the conclusion that it is financially impossible to continue St. Bernadette 's . Of course he knew that this decision would sadden you . It would be a blow to any parish . What he did not anticipate was that you would refuse to share with him a realization of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action in seeking an injunction against the archdiocese , I am convinced that your refusal stems from a failure to understand . Now , I mean no reproach . " Ile held up a calming hand . " On the contrary . It has been my duty to explain to you His Eminence 's decision . If there has been a failure of communication , then the error is mine . All I ask is your indulgence while I review the underlying facts . " The parents were politely attentive and silent . Thatcher began to revise his views of amateurs . Or rather , he decided that Omara and Mrs. Foster , obviously calling the signals , were not total amateurs . Mrs. Foster was clearly reserving her fire . Omara might have been thinking of something else . Undeterred , Miles launched into the history of St. Bernadette 's , with particular attention to the long period in which it drew on teaching nuns for its entire staff . Then came the lay teacher , the organization of the Lay Teachers Union , and the last salary negotiations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a plea for understanding of the official position . " It is impossible for St. Bernadette 's to continue providing education as it has in the past . We must therefore look to the future . The school will have to be closed and disposed of . The archdiocese presently has an attractive offer for the property . We shall continue to carry out our obligation to make available the best possible religious instruc-  | tion after hours . In order to fulfill that obligation we must take advantage of this offer . I have asked Mr. Unger to be present so that he can explain his position to you . " Dick Unger spoke up on cue . " I know this is basically your problem . All I can do is explain things from my side . The location of the parochial school is excellent for an apartment building . There are n't many good sites left in the city . And I think I can promise you that our building will help upgrade your whole community and raise your property values . But I do n't plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not going to send in the wreckers if you parents are lying down in their path . Whether or not the school closes is up to you . All I can tell you is that I do n't honestly think you 'll get a better offer than mine . And my offer wo n't stay open forever . I ca n't afford to run my business that way . Mr. Thatcher from the Sloan probably feels the same . " Thus summoned , Thatcher solemnly agreed that the Sloan would not tie up mortgage money indefinitely . To show he was on the side of the angels  --  though their precise location was growing more obscure by the moment  --  he agreed that he was against sending wreckers over a living rampart of human bodies . Monsignor Miles thanked them both and said he thought that fairly covered the situation . He had spoken fluently , cogently and persuasively . But not persuasively enough . Francis Omara emerged from some private meditation and shook his head sadly . " I can not agree that we have covered the entire situation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Baltimore Council , which imposed on us the sacred obligation to provide near each church , a parochial school . I can remember my grandparents telling the story of the tithing in this very parish to build St. Bernadette 's . They did not regard the existence of a Catholic school as something to be settled on grounds of financial difficulty  --  and neither do we ! But of course we recognize  | the problem . And Mrs. Foster has gathered together some of the data we feel should be considered . All I ask " ? and here Omara 's mobile face was lit by a sudden grin ? " is your indulgence for her material . " Mary Foster 's speech was designed to kill forever the assumption that the Parents League did not understand the situation . In essence , she was providing alternatives to the sale of St. Bernadette 's . She reviewed the cases in the Midwest where Catholic schools shared facilities with public schools , thereby economizing on laboratories , audio-visual aids and workshops . She described the accommodations possible under this scheme . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had taken two or three years to solve a problem disposed of by Cardinal Devlin almost overnight . She went on to outline the possibility of leasing the school building to the parents . She hinted at mutual assistance arrangements with other parishes , before they went down one by one . To his eternal credit , Monsignor Miles not only heard her with every evidence of courteous attention , but quelled an intemperate response on the part of Henry Stonor . Stonor seemed to regard comparisons with other archdioceses as hitting below the belt . " I am pleased , of course , to learn that you have devoted so much serious attention to this problem " the Monsignor said , wresting the reins of conversation from his impetuous subordinate . " And startled too , I will confess . I can only regret that you were unable to discuss some of these suggestions with His Eminence before an irrevocable decision was made . And I do sincerely hope that , now that he has spoken , you will bring the same thoughtful consideration to the problems which will face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you have difficulty in agreeing , you will at least see that this action has been taken in good faith , with the well-being of the parish firmly in mind . "  | " Well , I do n't ! " It would , Thatcher saw , be as easy to stop a runaway horse as silence Bob Horvath at this juncture . He was squared up to the table , his big body leaning forward earnestly . " It 's like Mary Foster says . This decision was n't made as part of the big picture . You want to close down our school . But new Catholic schools are being built right this minute out in the suburbs . And they do n't have problems in their public schools the way we do . There 's just as big a shortage of teaching nuns for them . And they do n't even have buildings or land . They 've got to start from scratch . But nobody talks about their sharing with anybody . Somehow they can have a school and we ca n't . God knows we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our well-being comes in . " Rebellion , once manifest , is contagious . " That 's just it , " Pat Ianello said , her hair bouncing with the vigor of her speech . " It is n't fair . ' We 've always had a parochial school . St. Bernadette 's means something to the people of this parish . More than a new school could mean to anybody . And even if it 's difficult to keep it going , I do n't see that that 's a reason to stop . " Like a good commander , Francis Omara came to the support of his troops . His earlier abstraction was now discarded and he spoke earnestly . " We do n't mean that the suburbs should n't have their new schools . That 's what progress is . But we can not measure a moral obligation in terms of dollars and cents . I deeply regret offending anyone here , but I am shocked to hear a discussion of Catholic education based entirely on wages and maintenance costs . And it 's not just this discussion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't believe it  --  not without proof , I ca n't  --  that there are people actually hoping to profit from the closing of our school . And I do not appreciate this fine talk about how a high-rise apartment will upgrade Flensburg and raise property values . You can not , " he  | declaimed , " upgrade a community that has lost its soul ! " Monsignor Miles did not address himself to the last challenge  --  and wisely so , in Thatcher 's opinion . Instead he chose to become Dick Unger 's advocate . " Mr. Omara , I make every allowance for your feelings , and in many ways they are commendable . But I have asked Mr. Unger here as my guest , and I can not have him victimized by our disagreements . Whatever the merits of your position , or of my position , whatever failure of responsibility you or I have displayed , Mr. Unger has never undertaken any duty toward St. Bernadette 's . " For the first time , Omara showed signs of anger . " I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victim . The real victims are the children going to St. Bernadette 's . We should be thinking about them . That 's our duty . Not to be thinking about the dollars and cents that can be wrung out of the parish , not to be thinking about the money that can be made when fine apartments and shops come to Flensburg . " Dick Unger had thought of himself as an observer . He was stung to find himself on the firing line . " Look , I 'm in the real estate business . Just the way you 're in the undertaking business . It would be a fine thing for the parish if everybody could be buried for free , but that 's not the way Omara 's Funeral Home works . And you 're in nc position to expect Unger Realty to work any differently . I 'm sorry about your problems , but you 'll have to live with the idea that we make a profit out of real estate deals . And it 's an idea you know all about . " Surprisingly this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had not heard , he addressed himself to the Monsignor . " It 's not Mr. Unger 's little profits I was referring to , " he said , rising above four million dollars with large disdain ,  | " Mr. Unger has been completely open with us . Unlike some I could name . As you say , he is not abdicating a duty . But those who do have a duty will have to pay for their hypocrisv . Because this Parents League is unalterably committed to the continuation of St. Bernadette 's . In one form or another . We are prepared to bear the burden of changing times . And I think you will find that most people in the parish stand ready to support us in court . I can only say I am sorry we have to take our troubles to an alien tribunal . " This time Monsignor Miles made no attempt to restrain his associate . Perhaps he wanted to see if a dose of the church militant would do any good . " You may well be sorry , Mr. Omara @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man who condemns hypocrisy , you should take into consideration that your lawsuit can not be successful . No one can deny the Archbishop 's right to dispose of diocesan property . You will merely invite unsavory publicity and ignorant attacks on the Church . That is all you can hope to accomplish , and it is not a goal worthy of a man who professes to deal in moral issues . " The speech was certainly intended as a denunciation . It brought red spots to Francis Omara 's cheeks . Unfortunately , it also flushed the enthusiast in the group . " Now there , " said ' Willard Ericson , " I think you may be A little hasty , Mr. Stonor . Mr. Omara can hope to accomplish much more . That is , if he is prepared to make full use .. I the judicial and legislative processes of the State of New York . After all , we have barely scratched at the courses of act ion open to him . Has he , for instance , consulted with the abutting property owners ? Property @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well have peculiar characteristics . Have these property owners acted in reliance oil these characteristics ? Have they possibly acquired an casement for light and air ? An easement which would be  | violated by the construction of a high-rise building ? As for the question of who has the right to dispose of the property , I think you are overly optimistic in thinking that a lower court 's opinion will hold much weight . It is certainly an issue that I , for one , would wish to see pursued to the highest court in the state . Or elsewhere . " The sinister relish in Willard Ericson 's voice escaped no one . Certainly Monsignor Miles was looking at him in more open dismay than he had accorded anybody else . Here , he might have been saying to himself , is a real eminence grise . To confirm his worst fears , he ventured a question . " And what did you mean by your reference to legislative processes , Mr. Ericson ? " Ericson returned from a reverie that all too clearly consisted of innumerable injunctions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recalled , was to stall for time . Willard Ericson promised to be a champion staller . Little babies now in their cradles would be clutching graduation diplomas from St. Bernadette 's if he were given his head . " What 's that ? " Ericson blinked . " Oh , the legislative process ! I do think that , in the last analysis , the courts are not the appropriate arbiters for this type of disagreement . I think you will find that a good deal of enthusiasm could be whipped up for legislative change . " Not in this company , thought Thatcher , lookinb at the rigid countenances of Monsignor Miles and Father James . Ericson had soared a long way beyond St. Bernadette 's . " It 's been decades since the Religious Corporation Law was revised , " he reminded himself . " Indeed , many people think it past due for a good overhaul . Does it really meet the needs of the modern religious community ? We may well ask ourselves . Certainly a general revision would settle the question of authority to dispose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There was one thing to be said for the grandeur of Wil-  | lard Ericson 's imagination . It silenced all the participants and eventually dismissed them from their little classroom , having agreed only to disagree . As he was getting into his coat , Thatcher heard Henry Stonor . " What does he mean about revising the Religious Corporation Act ? Do you think he realizes how many voters in this state are Catholic ? " Monsignor Miles looked at his subordinate wearily . " The Catholics , Henry , are the ones to worry about ! "  | John Thatcher brought away only one positive impression from the meeting in Flensburg , and that concerned a man , not an issue . In Monsignor Raymond Miles he recognized a professional problem-solver . No doubt the man had other , more priestly , attributes . But , despite his cloth , Miles was unmistakably the servant of a large and important institution . That this was the Roman Catholic Church was not particularly pertinent . In matters non-spiritual , large institutions resemble each other more than they differ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Omara and the committee canvassed the parish , Thatcher knew that the Church , in the form of Monsignor Miles , was going to take steps of its own . Furthermore , Thatcher had a fair notion that those first steps were going to be taken almost immediately . he was right . Monsignor Miles set to work early the next morning . First , he dictated a full report of the Flensburg situation . This would circulate among a small group , including Cardinal Devlin , before going into the files to swell the rapidly growing dossier on St. Bernadette 's . Then he breakfasted with his immediate superior . 38  | " You 're going to have to handle this on your own , " said Bishop Shuster , after hearing him out . " Keep me informed . " Miles was not surprised . Bishop Shuster was a very busy man . " Three hundred sisters threatening to secularize , Ray , " he replied mournfully , when Miles asked about the latest trouble spot . " That 's two high schools , four grammar schools , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bishop Shuster plan to tackle the Order of Teresian Sisters ? " I 've got an appointment with Sister Mary Veronica , " he replied glumly . " Can that woman talk ! I 'll just have to do my best and play it by ear . If you get any ideas , Ray , let me know . " Miles promised to do so and , proceeding to the the small , spare cubicle that was his office , put his mind to his own problems . Because , as John Thatcher had guessed , Miles did serve as a high-level trouble-shooter . He was a skilled arbitrator in secular matters ; he had dealt with striking gravediggers , arranged missionary evacuations from all over Africa , and organized more conferences than he cared to recall . He was sincerely valued by his Cardinal and largely unknown to others , although he had earned a small measure of fame in connection with Pope Paul 's visit to New York . Monsignor Miles stinted none of his talents in the service of his Church . On the other hand , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he sat in silence , he automatically drew out a small notepad and began jotting notes . The first item of business was finding a useful outlet for youthful zeal . With a sigh , Monsignor Miles lifted the phone and asked the receptionist to send in Father Livingston and Mr. Stonor . " No , " he said gently when they bustled in . " I 'm afraid we do n't have time to review the meeting . Henry will fill you in.  | It was not going to be that easy . " What about Father Doyle ? " asked the young priest . " Is he really sick ? " Monsignor Miles was a realist . " Father Doyle is an old man . Tired too . We can scarcely ask him to fight our battle for us . " He did not add that Father Doyle was probably in agreement with the parents . There is no use shocking the pious young . " . . . and Mother Superior ? " Father Livingston persisted . " The same story , I 'm afraid . Now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " In a few sentences , Miles outlined a plan . It was time to organize a meeting of parishioners who did not support Frank Omara . " Yes , " said Father Livingston eagerly , quivering to get at it . Miles watched him go with a suppressed sigh and turned to Stonor . " There is already some mention of this affair in the press , " Stonor reported darkly , handing him a folder . " You 're being too pessimistic , " Miles commented . " Only an inch here and an inch there . . . " So far , the metropolitan press had simply reported the official statement released by the archdiocese . Why was Stonor complaining ? Just then , Monsignor Miles came across a sliver of paper , a clipping from The New York Times . In three lines , it described parent protest in Flensburg . " Only the beginning , " said Henry Stonor . " If that stiffnecked bunch ? " " Charity , charity , Henry ! " Henry forged ahead . " And if the publicity gets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of course , the diocesan press . . . Miles closed his eyes . " I do n't think we have to worry about the diocesan press . " " We do have to worry about the Times . Not to speak of  | Time and Newsweek , " Henry retorted . " I 'll run off a long and frank discussion of the economic squeeze on St. Bernadette 's  --  plenty of facts and figures . Then I 'll emphasize how this four million will help with the diocesan deficit . Then we 'll punch how the diocese spends its money  --  youth centers , charities , counseling services . And I 'll be very careful about the mission to the ghetto . . . " Monsignor Miles approved the plans and sent Stonor on his way . He himself did not have high hopes from these formalities . For instance , take drumming up support for closing St. Bernadette 's . Father Livingston would arrange a meeting , all right , but Miles knew that the parents of St. Bernadette 's wanted to save the school . True , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the Church . But there would be precious little conviction . Except among the childless and the elderly . And as for publicity ? Sufficient unto the day .. . Miles reached for the phone and got in touch with the Chancery 's legal specialists . Willard Ericson seemed to have put them all on their mettle . So far as Miles could see , they were in some danger of losing sight of fundamentals . " You will remember , wo n't you , that our goal is to sell St. Bernadette 's as smoothly as possible ? We do not aspire to make legal history . " " No , no ! " chorused several graduates of Fordham Law School . " All right , " said Miles . " We 'll just have to pray it does n't come to court . " He wished he could believe that they joined him in this . Luncheon provided him a brief respite from St. Bernadette 's . Discussion at his table centered on television . Monsignor Kilduff had seen a rock group of seminarians called , he assured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Since Monsignor Kilduff was eighty years old , his  | companions were treated to a trenchant review of the days when preparing for the priesthood really meant something . But once returned to his office , Miles put Thomas Aquinas behind him for more pressing concerns . Again he reached for the phone . His first call was to a prominent Catholic layman , whose munificent contributions had already drawn papal recognition . Jeremiah V. Kinneally was also the owner of one of the largest chains of funeral homes in the archdiocese . " Frank Omara ? " he repeated after greeting Miles with respectful familiarity . " Sure , Monsignor , I 've met him at the association meetings  --  that is , you mean the son , do n't you ? The old man is semi-retired these days . Father and son , they 've got a good reputation . That 's a nice little operation they run up there  --  where is it , Flensburg ? Woodside ? Been there for years , you know . Oh , I 'd say a little on the conservative side . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Miles took this to refer to commercial methods . At any rate , Kinneally , who enjoyed the sound of his own voice , rambled on without producing anything of interest . Omara was a good solid citizen . He was a good Catholic . He was probably a good man . There was nothing there to help Monsignor Miles . He frowned . Then , dialing again , he put through a second call . This time it was to a clerk of court who kept an eye on the Flensburgs of this world for the Democratic Party . " No . . . no . . . I do n't know any of them , Monsignor ? wait a minute , what was that last name ? " " Mary Foster , " Monsignor Miles repeated , glancing at his notes . " Mrs. Larry Foster . " " Now let me see . . . let me see . Yeah . . . I think that 's the Mary Foster who ran for Borough Council last time around . Hey , Joe ! You remember that Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Monsignor . I do n't know her myself , but they said she did n't make a bad showing for the first time out . Got a lot of friends with the ladies ' groups . Sorry I ca n't help you more . . . any time , any time ! " Monsignor Miles 's other contacts were even less helpful . A vice president-of A &P,; returning his call some hours later , testified that the Personnel Department reported that Salvatore Ianello , husband of Patricia Ianello , was married , had two children , and was , according to his latest progress report , one of the best young managers in the whole operation . " He 's going places , " said a gravelly voice . " Not afraid of a little work , like some of them . " " Thank you ... " " Going to transfer him into one of the newer , bigger stores any day now ! " " Good . " " I 've said it before and I 'll say it again , a man 's willing to work hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Monsignor Miles knew that Mr. Adikes had said this before . He had heard him . " Spoiling them all with these frills . Why , when I first started . . . " The Teamsters ' Union was not interested in the hardier past nor even in the rosier future . It was , in fact , almost laconic . " Robert C. Horvath . . . yup . Pays his dues ! A member in good standing , Monsignor . No , he 's not active . " The only surprise that the telephone provided came from the Catholic Lawyers ' Association . " Are you sure ? " Miles could not help demanding . The Catholic Lawyers ' Association was quite sure and a shade offended . No , Willard Ericson was not a member . The reason he was not a member , Monsignor , was that he was not a Catholic . He was not even an Episcopalian . Miles was still puzzling out the implications of this when  | Father Livingston arrived , flushed with victory . He had arranged a meeting for that very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hilt by producing parishioners who could be counted on to support their spiritual mentors . Mr. Unger had agreed to come out once again . This enthusiastic recital faltered in the face of Miles 's expression . " It is only , " said Monsignor Miles , " that the flesh is weak . Two nights in a row in Flensburg . . . no doubt the strength will be given us . Eight o'clock , I think you said ? " By eight o'clock that evening Monsignor Miles was instructing his driver to return in two hours . As he turned to enter the parish house , his eye fell on the bright storefront across Jackson Boulevard . The bakery and the barbershop were closed and dark . Only one store was open . SAINT BERNADETTE 'S PARENTS LEAGUE SAVE OUR SCHOOL A CATHOLIC SCHOOL FOR CATHOLIC CHILDREN Monsignor Miles read the slogans with some interest . He noted the general coming and going . A middle-aged couple emerged from the store , arms filled with literature . Monsignor Miles waited for a bus to pass , then crossed Jackson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a bare , vacant store . The fixtures had been removed and replaced by ramshackle , battered tables and folding chairs . Along the wall stood cardboard boxes filled with brochures . There was an ancient mimeograph machine in the corner . Mary Foster , who was talking to a young couple , broke off as he entered . " Monsignor Miles , " she said , sounding surprised . The young couple looked appalled .  | " Just thought I 'd come and see how you are getting along , Mrs. Foster , " said Monsignor Miles easily . " We 're very glad to welcome you , Monsignor , " she replied . Her calm earned a look of admiration from the young recruits . Happily for them , Francis Omara appeared at the back door . He was carrying a carton . " Here are the petitions you wanted , Mary . " He caught sight of Miles but did not break stride . Depositing his burden on a table , he came forward to greet him . " This is a very considerable operation you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Omara replied soberly . " We 're trying to contact everybody in the parish , you see . " From behind Miles there was a gasp . One of the young people , he guessed . Mrs. Foster 's voice remained even . " I 'll have to be getting along , Frank . If I can just have another box of peti-tions ? " " Here you are , Mary , " Omara replied promptly . " But I have n't finished with the master list . It can wait . . . " " All right , " Mary Foster said promptly . " If Bob drops in , tell him I 'll get the press releases to him tomorrow by the latest . " Unmoved by this byplay , Monsignor Miles bade a courteous farewell to the leavetakers . The young couple was glad to escape . He was alone with Frank Omara . Omara was not totally at ease . " We do n't like going against the Cardinal , " he said quietly . Miles nodded sympathetically but protested : " Not just going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter of dividing the parish , setting people against each other . You have all lived in harmony until now . Will it be the same if you start quarreling amongst yourselves ? " Omara replied almost eagerly . He might have been wait-  | ing for an opportunity to unburden himself . " It 's a painful thing for me , Monsignor . These are my people , we have all worked with each other . But I must do what is right . And I can not help feeling wounded . I know I should n't let that influence me , but a man has his pride . " " You know that I am on my way to St. Bernadette 's ? We are having a meeting of parents who support the Cardinal . Is that what you want ? " Monsignor Miles did not receive a direct reply . " It 's a terrible thing for one person to use another . It debases both of them . I do n't want to look at things that way . But , all the same , it bothers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had first feared that Omara was accusing him of exploitation . Now he wondered if the Parents League appeared in that light . " If you are truly troubled , should n't we discuss it ? " he asked at length . Of one thing he was convinced , Francis Omara was sincere . Omara 's frown lightened . " I 'd like to do that , Monsignor . It would be a comfort to me . But not now . I must speak with someone else first . Maybe my doubts will be laid to rest . " " Ah well , " said Monsignor Miles . " I hope we will all be less troubled . I must be getting to the meeting . God bless you , Frank . " Omara murmured his gratitude . Saint or sinner , Miles reflected , he was the stuff who caused the Church its most grievous trouble . Within St. Bernadette 's , Monsignor Miles found Dick Unger , Father Livingston and Father James awaiting him . With them were six nervous parishioners . " Father Doyle , " announced Father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling well . He asked me to deputize . . . " " We understand , " said Monsignor Miles . His practiced  | cye told him that tonight Mr. Unger would witness submission , piety and obedience . He only wished that more useful virtues would appear . It was many hours later . The long day was ending and St. Bernadette 's lay silent and quiet under a dark , clouded sky . The human passions , anxieties and worries about the school were banked for the night , waiting for the dawn . But not everywhere . At midnight , the telephone shrilled through the silent rectory with the harsh jangle that telephones assume in the night . Father James raised his head . He had just finished reading his office . He waited . The phone shrilled again . Reminding himself quite erroneously that the elderly are heavy sleepers , Father James pushed back his chair , fished for his shoes and hurried downstairs to the hallway , grateful for the ugly Victorian lamp that burned day and night in the gloom . " Hello ! . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm so sorry to bother you at this hour ... " The woman 's voice was anxious and apologetic . Father James thrust aside other thoughts . This was part of his calling . " Tell me . . . " he began . But the woman would not let him finish . " Oh , Father . . . it 's Kathleen Omara . . . and I 'm so worried about Frank . .. " " Good heavens , " said Father James with true concern . " He said he 'd be home early . . . and he does n't answer the phone . . . do you think . . . would you . . . ? " Father James reassured Mrs. Omara although he was none too pleased with her request . He would have responded willingly to any call from his flock , even from Francis  | Omara . Instead , he was being asked to run across the street to see if Omara was still toiling for the Parents League . Father James pulled on a coat , adjusted the lock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set forth . Headquarters of the Parents League , he saw with disapproval , was still open . Lights blazed . Shivering in the cold , Father James unconsciously lengthened his stride . By the time he reached the door , he was composing a searing sermon on The Humble Heart . " Omara ! " he called , opening the door . The store was empty . " Omara ! " Father James called again , almost roughly . He took a step indoors . Unlike Monsignor Miles , he had not previously inspected this place of defiance . His eye fell on a poster . WHY SHOULD OUR CHILDREN BE PUNISHED ? His expression hardening , he repeated : " Omara ? Are you here ? Your wife is worried about you . . . " It was bad enough that these people set themselves up against their superiors . Now they expected him to run their errands for them . Well , they were sadly mistaken . Father James strode to the back door and flung it open . " Omara , are you back here . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cascade of light into the dusty darkness of the storeroom silenced him . Father James had indeed been summoned to one of his flock . Francis Omara lay where he had been struck down . Blood told its own terrible story . For one moment , Father James stood stunned . Then he struggled free and dropped beside the fallen man . Omara was dead . Beside his body , his priest bowed his head .  | ' Within an hour of arriving on the scene the Homicide Squad had seen enough to realize that they were not dealing with a casual crime . " You just have to take one look at the setup , " a detective argued . " The snap lock on the back door has n't been forced . Whoever did this came in openly . " " And it was n't a pro , " the sergeant replied . " They 'd know enough to realize there would n't be any cash here . You can see it 's not a store . It 's nothing but an information center . Even a junkie would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a junkie . " The detective 's arm swept around in a circle . " Omara was talking to somebody . Somebody he knew . " They were standing in the back room , but it was no longer dim and shadowed . Portable floodlights illuminated every corner , exposing debris untouched since the last permanent tenant had moved . There was a cracked ironstone sink , a massive butcher 's block and the broken handles of unknown instruments . A row of hooks ran across one wall , 49  | at the base of which Francis Omara 's body lay outstretched , his right hand still clutching a black overcoat . " He was getting ready to go home , " the sergeant murmured reflectively . " He 'd already cleaned up the desk and stuffed some papers into his briefcase . Then he came back here to get his coat . Whoever was with him followed . Then , when his back was turned  --  bang ! " " He sure as hell did n't invite a junkie to come back here where they could n't be seen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't count on finding a butcher 's mallet waiting for them . " Both men looked down at the floor where the bloodstained mallet still lay . Encrusted dirt and smashed cobwebs were mute evidence that the mallet was a holdover from the days of Herb 's Meat Market . The sergeant sighed . " Okay . I guess everything can go now . Did that priest go out to the widow with the patrol car ? " " Yes , he did . She 'll be ready for us now . " Whatever suspicions the detectives had were confirmed by Kathleen Omara . She had no doubt at all about the cause of her husband 's death . " It 's because he was head of the Parents League , " she said between sobs . " Some people are so bigoted they hate the thought of any change . " By her side Father James , who should have looked consoling , looked embarrassed . The detectives already knew about the Parents League . They had had time to read one of the handouts . ' They asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troubles , gambling debts ? " You do n't understand , " the widow wailed . " Frank was n't like that . He was an easygoing man . He did n't get involved in a lot of outside activities . He ran his business  | and tried to spend his spare time home with us . It was because he was so terribly concerned that he started the League . Oh , if only he never had ! " But why , they asked with kindly insistence , did she suppose the League had led to his death ? " Because he was terribly disturbed after the meeting yesterday . He told me so himself . Frank was such a good man ? sometimes it was a terrible handicap to him . He did n't understand how other people could feel differently . But he said he was n't going to stand for what someone was doing to St. Bernadette 's . He was going to give them a chance to explain . Then he could n't keep silent any more . " The detectives persisted but they learned nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact . Frank Omara had determined to speak with someone just before his murder . Father James followed the detectives to the Omara front door , stepping awkwardly aside to let a tearful aunt and two nieces enter . " I would n't . . . that is ... " The detectives waited patiently . Father James steeled himself . " I would n't pay too much attention to what Mrs. Omara says now . The poor woman is distraught . She does n't know what she 's saying . " The detectives exchanged glances . " Sure , Father . Well , thanks . And good night to you . " Father James watched them leave , a bleak look around his young eyes . News of Frank Omara 's murder reached the Sloan early the next morning . Thatcher arrived at his office to find two detectives awaiting him . In the background , Miss Corsa looked censorious . " Just a few minutes , " said one of them . In point of fact , it was a full half hour . At least , Thatcher  | thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Omara , this was deferring other evils . It was a moot point as to which was the better way to start a day : murder in Flensburg or the collapse of National University Research , Inc . " Yes , I heard it on the radio , " he said . " I assumed it was burglary . . . " The younger detective leaned forward . " There 's a lot riding on this St. Bernadette 's fight , is n't there ? " Thatcher agreed that there was . " Money , " said the specialist . " And a lot of bad feelings . " " Well , yes , " said Thatcher . " That 's good enough for murder any day , " said the police , departing . So Thatcher was not surprised when Dick Unger turned up later in the morning , incapable of keeping his mind on business . He was , in fact , white around the nostrils . " I do n't see what you 're so upset about , " Thatcher remarked . " Of course , it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interrupted him unceremoniously . " Where were you last night ? " " At a dinner and meeting of economic forecasters , " Thatcher replied . " But . . . " " No wonder you 're not upset , " Unger said petulantly . " I was in Flensburg ! Leaving the rectory across the street from the scene of the murder . At just about the right time ! " Thatcher refused to be stampeded . " Several thousand people were in Flensburg last night . I do n't see why you expect the police to single you out . " " Because they 've got some screwy version of that meeting we had with Omara . " Unger had shed his languid elegance . " They think I said this was the opportunity of a lifetime . And Omara said he 'd die before he let me make  | money out of that school . The explanation is simple to the police . I saw an obstacle and removed it ! " " You 're losing your sense of proportion , " Thatcher told him . " After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for years without gunning your way to success . If the police do n't know it yet , they soon will . " " Do you know what they wanted from me ? They wanted a list of all our past purchases ! I suppose they 're going to check to see if Unger Realty has left the field littered with corpses . " Unger 's voice was rising . Thatcher coughed . " Just as a matter of curiosity , " he inquired , " have there been many sudden deaths surrounding your acquisitions ? " " No , there have n't ! " Unger snapped . He removed an immaculate handkerchief of pale lemon yellow from his breast pocket and mopped his brow . " Then you have nothing to worry about . " Thatcher dismissed the whole subject . " Now , perhaps we can talk about these FHA requirements ? " " All right , all right . " But Dick Unger did not sound happy . The police approach to the Chancery of the Archdiocese of New York had been the occasion for a good deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have heard of Francis Omara 's murder , Monsignor Miles ? " The speaker was a very superior specimen of New York 's Finest . He had been handpicked for this assignment with parochial school and Notre Dame prominent in his background . He was also intelligent and courteous . " Yes , I have already been informed . " Monsignor Miles 's  | breakfast had been interrupted by a phone call from Flensburg . " I understand he was killed in Parents League headquarters last night . " " That 's right , Monsignor . Probably between ten and eleven . " " It 's scarcely believable . Yesterday evening I spoke to him there myself . He said he wanted to talk to me about something . " The superior specimen flinched . " I suppose there were a lot of people Mr. Omara wanted to speak to , " he suggested almost pleadingly . " Yes , I think he did . " Monsignor Miles was meticulously accurate . " But he was a deeply troubled man . I regret I did not learn what was worrying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Trying to be helpful , he continued : " That would have been shortly before I visited the rectory . At eight o'clock approximately . " " Thank you . " The detective had a short struggle with his conscience , then decided that if anybody wanted to ask the Monsignor for an alibi , it would have to be the Commissioner . " I wonder if you could describe some of the details of your meeting at the school the day before . " Miles complied with a virtually verbatim transcript . Pressed as to Francis Omara 's accusations about doubledealing , he came near shrugging . " Mr. Unger was not upset , no . He realized Mr. Omara had been carried away by the heat of the moment . And Francis Omara did apologize . There was no ill-feeling of any sort , I assure you . " " Did Mr. Unger say that this was an unusual opportunity for his company ? " " I recall his saying that St. Bernadette 's was an excellent location for an apartment building . I do n't think you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unger was trying to keep Mr. Omara from preventing the whole transaction .  | As , indeed , I was myself . That , after all , was the purpose of the meeting . " " Of course , " said the superior specimen , rising . In a triumph of cunning , he had had an idea . Henry Stonor looked up from his typewriter coldly . " Yes , I was at the meeting in Flensburg with Francis Omara and the others , " he said , enunciating clearly . The Stonor description of Francis Omara 's behavior suggested that his death might be due to divine retribution . " About last night . . . ? " Stonor glanced down at his typewriter . Then , with elaborate patience , he accorded the second Flensburg meeting far more approval . " And it broke up when ? " " At . . . oh , I 'd say . . . a little before ten , " said Stonor . " And you and Monsignor came directly back here ? " Henry Stonor could not resist scoring a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes ' wait until the limousine came . Monsignor wanted a breath of fresh air , so he strolled around outside . I stayed indoors , finishing some notes . " The detective was disheartened . " So you do n't have an alibi  --  either ! " Henry Stonor was thunderstruck . " An alibi ? Good God , man , what are you implying ! " He would have been more thunderstruck if he had paused to explore the implications of that either . Monsignor Miles also was without an alibi . John Thatcher , Dick Unger , even Monsignor Miles , could put the murder of Frank Omara and police inquiries from their minds . Flensburg , and a small , brightly lit shop on a dark street were a long way from their normal rounds . This was not true of the Parents League . " All right ! So I 've told you what I know , " Bob Horvath  | exploded . " But I was on Omara 's side  --  ca n't you get that through your thick heads ? " The police said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do ! " he retorted . " Why do n't you go after the people who were against Frank ? " They said they were questioning everyone they could find . Who were Omara 's enemies , anyway ? " Mostly a bunch of old biddies , " Horvath growled contemptuously . " Like Kavanaugh downstairs . He 's always trying to stir up trouble . " They were interested now . " Who does he stir it up with ? " For the first time , Horvath became evasive . He did n't know . He could n't remember . He did n't mean anybody in particular . " Okay , Horvath . Just for the record , where were you last night ? " Evasiveness became withdrawal . " Home in bed , " Horvath said flatly . " Ask Ruthie . I get up at five . " They asked Ruthie . Of course Bob was in bed . Where else would he be ? She ? Well , she had stayed up to watch Monsignor Sheen on the Dick Cavett show . Had they seen it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you could tell he took drugs .. . Pat Ianello was too shocked to be aggressive . " But that 's awful ! Poor Kathleen Omara ! And with four children too . " She honestly tried to be helpful , she searched her memory , she held back nothing . But her answers were less satisfactory than those of Bob Horvath . She could not confine herself to being responsive . Inevitably her replies broadened into forebodings . " I do n't know what 's going to happen to us here , " she  | predicted sadly . " Feelings were beginning to run high already . But now ! It 'll be a matter of people being with us or against us . We were trying to keep everybody in the parish together , but this will split them apart . I 'm afraid to think of what St. Bernadette 's is going to be like . " By now , the police had had a bellyful of feelings . " And you , Mrs. Ianello ? Where were you last night ? And where was your husband ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " We were home in bed , " she said with quiet dignity . " Together . " The effect was spoiled by her deep blush . Pat Ianello was not the only one to fear what the future held for St. Bernadette 's . The first reaction to Francis Omara 's death had already taken place . Father Doyle was back on duty . Even if Francis Omara had died a natural death , he would have hurried to the widow 's side . But now he knew that his entire parish needed him . During his visit to the house of mourning he concentrated on providing comfort and support . He prayed with Kathleen . He consulted with the elder Omara , refusing to agree that it was a blessing the eldest boy had reached the age to take some responsibility from his mother . Years of experience as a parish priest lay behind his advice . Bereaved women did not need self-reliant adolescents around . What they needed was children dependent upon them . The blessing in the Omara home was seven-year-old Mavis . No matter what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she required explanation and consolation . Kathleen would not break down while Mavis needed her care . Let Peter go and stay with his grandfather . But as he trudged back toward the rectory , Father Doyle let himself contemplate the future . He feared that the evil-  | doer was a member of his parish . But he was not concerning himself with the identity of the murderer  --  although a soul in mortal peril must always be a cruel anxiety to Father Doyle . In time , he would know . In time , he devoutly prayed , there would be penitence and absolution . But now there were hundreds of others in danger of succumbing to malice and hatred . He was tempted to condemn himself for his selfish withdrawal from the combat . But he dismissed this as selfdramatization . He should worry more about his duty to discipline Father James . The young curate had arrived at St. Bernadette 's burning to join a crusade . When the crusade appeared , he had been appalled at its nature . Father Doyle had been content with preventing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough ? He knew he had turned a blind eye to the spectacle of Father James and Phil Kavanaugh huddled together . He knew that Kavanaugh was spiteful , small-minded and envious . He knew that Father James 's defects stemmed from youth . Should he have let the association flourish ? Had he added the weight of church authority to Kavanaugh 's backbiting ? Had he , most important of all , let Father James stray into a contaminating in-timacy ? Father Doyle made up his mind . One thing was settled . Father James would be too busy to have time for Philip Kavanaugh . St. Bernadette 's was not going to be pulled apart with the parish priest on one side and the curate on the other . Not if Father James wanted to stay here . Having reached his decision , Father Doyle knew that the next step was to disseminate it among his parishioners . He could start the good work right now , he thought , entering a small suite of offices in the middle of the block . Here a small insurance agent did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself was a compound of hustling energy  | and total disorganization . The ship was kept on an even keel by Mrs. Mary Foster . She looked up as Father Doyle entered but did not smile . " Oh , Father , you 've heard ? " Father Doyle sat down beside her desk . " Yes . This is a terrible thing , Mary . And I do n't mean just because of the Omaras . " Mary nodded seriously . " I was sitting here thinking just that , Father , when you came in . In fact I have n't been able to think of anything else since the police left . You know , I saw Frank myself last night at headquarters . I almost wish I had n't . I do n't think I 'll ever forget how he looked . At his very best . Monsignor Miles was there , so Frank was looking very dignified , but at the same time , so sincere and full of life ? " She broke off to dab at her eyes . " Oh dear , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for her . Larry Foster had long since proved to himself , to his family and to his priest that he was not particularly good and not much of a man . Ah well , where the dear Lord put burdens , he also put strength . " In the end , Mary , " Father Doyle said , " what better way to remember Frank than as a good man ? Now , Mary , I do n't want to distress you , so be open with me . I 've been with the Omaras and I have n't really heard any of the details . I would like to know if you think the police are making real progress . " Mary said sadly that it did n't bother her to talk about it . " But I do n't know what the police are doing . The questions they asked me were just about the meeting at the school and what I saw last night . I could n't help them much . Frank did n't tell me anything . I just saw him for a few minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he uncovered something and was giving somebody a chance to explain things . "  | " That would have been like Frank , " the priest agreed . " To give even his enemy a chance to explain . " But Father Doyle 's heart sank at her words . They proved he was right in suspecting that the solution lay in his parish . " Now , Mary , " he continued , " I came here for a reason . I want to talk to you about your Parents League . Are you going on with it ? " Mary was very direct . " Father Doyle , even if we wanted to stop now , I do n't think people would let us . Quite a few of them have dropped by this morning . " " I was expecting that . I want you to know that certain things that have been going on in this parish are going to stop . Your campaign is no business of the parish clergy . " This statement would have come as a shock to Monsignor Miles . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Oh , we do n't mind , Father . We realize he 's young . He probably means well . " " And worse you can not say , " Father Doyle concluded grimly . " Nevertheless , I think it 's time the indulgence stopped . If you are going on , you  --  and the parish  --  will have enough trouble to cope with . " " We 'll try to keep you out of it , Father , " Mary promised . " But right now it 's hard to say what we 're letting ourselves in for , let alone anyone else . "  | Life , it has frequently been observed with outrage , goes on . Even in Flensburg , where Frank Omara 's murder hit nearest home . The Ianellos still had to rise at six o'clock , organize breakfast , supervise juvenile toothbrushings , find Sal 's freshly ironed shirt and make sure small Betty was shining enough to satisfy Sister Amelia Louise . Sister Amelia Louise had exercised a sharp eye for unwashed hands when Pat was in the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an inch of her life before she set forth for St. Bernadette 's . All this despite a true sense of Frank Omara 's loss . Mary Foster 's children were older . Larry was not a promising Sal . Still there was breakfast , there was bedmaking , there was makeup to be applied before the invaluable Mrs. Foster opened the office and started on the mail . Ruthie Horvath had sandwiches to make for Bob . Father Doyle had Mass to celebrate . Life went on , and so did the business of life . On Wall Street , of course , it was even worse . The business going on was not even satisfactory . The bond market was in disarray . Industrial averages were plumbing depths that junior trust officers had thought unattainable . State-61  | ments from the Treasury , the Federal Reserve , the Council of Economic Advisers and vice presidents of all Chicago banks were beginning to sound like black comedy . " ... while the unemployment rate rose last month . " Walter Bowman , the Sloan 's research chief met challenges with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; it made Walter redouble his zeal . Just now he was reporting official statistics for January 's economic performance . They had not yet been officially released by Washington and would not be for some days . Precisely how Walter had obtained them , John Thatcher preferred not to inquire . He did sometimes wonder if clandestine methods were involved . If so , he would have to cover for Walter should George Lancer , chairman of the board , ever catch wind of it . " .. . but the work week is down a good ten percent , " Bowman continued . " The way I see it , John , this policy is really working . That means the worst must be over . " Thatcher had expected Bowman to see an upturn coming . Walter , a huge bear of man , had a constitutional predilection for optimism . Anyone who used the information he was so incomparable at garnering learned to correct for this , just as dealing with Everett Gabler ( Rails and Industrials ) meant adjusting for a congenital instinct to look on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head . " The ICC has approved the western merger , " he said , in effect tut-tutting . No stranger could have inferred from his expression that this was good news for the western railroads and , more to the point , for the Sloan Guaranty Trust . " Say , that 's great ! " boomed Walter , a large man in more ways than one . When it came to the greater good , he rose above envy when someone else unearthed information before he did .  | Gabler fixed a severe eye on him . " It may be too late , Walter . Especially for the Duluth &; Boise . . . " While the familiar dialogue of boom versus bust went on , Thatcher withdrew to skim Walter 's report . He was not destined to be given time to do so . Life may go on , but death casts a long shadow . Miss Corsa entered , surveyed his eminent subordinates as though they were truants , and announced visitors . " Not the police again , I hope , " said Walter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of notice . " Mr. Willard Ericson , " she said clearly . " And a Mrs. Foster . " She then fixed a compelling eye on her employer . Despite himself , Thatcher was diverted . There was no one more reliable on the subject of unexpected visitors than Miss Corsa . Yet  --  and there was no denying it  --  St. Bernadette 's was causing her to jettison long-established habits . No doubt it touched something deep in her . " Show them in , " he said . Gabler and Bowman withdrew , with Everett looking as if he suspected Thatcher of ducking the Duluth &; Boise . Thatcher wished he could be sure that Gabler was n't right . Rising , he greeted his visitors . To Mrs. Foster , who was more muted than he remembered , he murmured a conventional word of regret at Frank Omara 's tragedy . " We all feel it , " she said soberly . Willard Ericson streamlined the conventions . " Terrible , terrible thing , " he said , shaking his head . " And it raises very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Ericson was referring either to police inquiries or to the difficulties now facing Omara 's survivors . Mrs. Foster , who had frowned slightly at Ericson 's words , explained .  | " It 's about going on with the Parents League , " she said to Thatcher . " You intend to continue the fight to save St. Bernadette 's ? " he asked quietly . She met his eyes . " Yes , " she said directly . " Frank would have wanted us to . Particularly if someone is trying to stop us . " Fortunately Ericson was not the man to indulge in sentimentality about the desires of the departed . " Of course , the suit we had contemplated is now a dead issue , " he said with unintentional brutality . " And it takes time to get these things done . So , Thatcher , I had another idea . .. " Mrs. Foster was almost reproving . " Mr. Ericson called me this morning at the office . There 's no one . . . that is , we 're not sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ericson looked at her . " You 'll have to get that straightened out fast , you know . " " I know , " she said sadly . " The committee will meet tonight . " Thatcher was beginning to wonder where he and the Sloan figured in this maneuvering . Fortunately , it was Mrs. Foster who proposed to enlighten him . " When Mr. Ericson called  --  well , I realized that in the excitement , I had n't really thought what would happen to the lawsuit . I had forgotten that the suit was brought in Frank 's name alone . " She looked at the lawyer . " Mr. Ericson says that we have to move fast ? " She broke off , took a breath , and said , " So we came up with another idea , Mr. Thatcher . " Thatcher suspected that this idea involved the Sloan . " Would you care to tell me about it ? " he said courteously . She flashed an appreciative smile at him . Then , as methodical as she had been the other night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Thatcher , we see other possibilities for running St. Bernadette 's . We have n't had time to explore them all , but we certainly intend to . And we intend to file a new injunction in the name of our new chairman . It is , after all , your mortgage money that is standing behind Unger Realty 's offer . Could n't you help us ? All we really are asking for is a little time . " Willard Ericson took this plea and added a twist of his own . " It would create an unfortunate public image if the Sloan Guaranty Trust and Unger Realty , between them , were to take advantage of this tragic occurrence . Particularly when , simply by freezing mortgage money for a short time , the Sloan would be contributing to the ... er . . . stability of a neighborhood in New York . " Thatcher eyed him indignantly . If ever he had seen a man oblivious to the need for stable neighborhoods , it was this legal Don Quixote . Nevertheless , he was in a dilemma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Foster 's appeal was a woman 's reasonable request . She did not want the Sloan to use Francis Omara 's murder to give St. Bernadette 's the final blow . Ericson was more subtle , and potentially more troublesome . In these days of social consciousness , the Sloan Guaranty Trust was as much a good citizen as anybody else . And Willard Ericson knew it . " Ye-es , " Thatcher temporized . Mrs. Foster leaned forward . " We are not really asking for much , Mr. Thatcher . It is only a breathing space  --  until we can regroup ourselves . " Ericson , Thatcher noted irately , looked like the cat who had swallowed the canary . He , at least , knew that they were asking a great deal . " Mrs. Foster , " he began , " you understand that we are distressed by Mr. Omara 's death . " " Yes , I do , " she said , still waiting .  | " On the other hand , we can scarcely let . . . violence shape our commercial policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And catch Ericson saying a word at this point ! Thatcher bowed to the inevitable . " However , I do see the force of your argument . Naturally , I ca n't give you a yes or no answer now . " " I did not expect one . I only ask  --  on behalf of the parents of Flensburg  --  that you give the suggestion serious thought . " She rose gracefully . " We wo n't take more of your time , Mr. Thatcher . And we will appreciate any consideration you can give us . " Murmuring the correct thing , Thatcher escorted them to the door . Mrs. Foster might be sincere , but Willard Ericson was a horse of another color . No lawyer could seriously hope for real deliverance by the Sloan . Presumably , therefore , he was buying time to concoct new legal deviltry . " Miss Corsa , " said Thatcher wearily , " you 'd better set up another appointment for me with Real Estate . We are about to waste more time on the parish of St. Bernadette @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am going to put the whole thing from my mind by escaping to lunch , " he told her sternly . Lunching with Tom Robichaux  --  old friend and investment banker  --  did take Thatcher far from the concerns of the parish of St. Bernadette 's . It was not high spirits that effected this translation . No financier was full of cheer these days . But as usual , Robichaux was carrying things to extremes . Today he had sent back not only his steak . He had sent back his baked potato as well . They were strolling out of Whyte 's when they encountered Stanton Carruthers . " Just the man I wanted to see , " said Thatcher grimly . Carruthers was unalarmed . He greeted his friends punctiliously. " . . . and how have you been , Tom ? "  | Since there was some danger of Tom 's telling him , and they did not have the time , Thatcher interrupted . " Stanton , leaving aside the point that when a member of your firm subpoenas the Sloan , I had hoped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing as friendship , these days , John . It 's dog eat dog . " Carruthers was stung . A hint of animation enlivened his bland , correct features . " Ericson is acting in a private capacity , " he replied stiffly . " Not as a member of the firm . It would have been the height of impropriety ? " " Sure , Stan , " said Robichaux , all resignation . " That 's what I mean . Everybody 's taking shortcuts , these days . Looking for an out . Oh , I do n't blame them . But I ca n't say it 's what I 'm used to . " Thatcher took a hand . " What I want to know is what 's gotten into Ericson ? " With a glare at Robichaux , who was looking heavenward , Carruthers unbent : " He 's not even Catholic , " he said , underscoring the point . " He 's not ? Well then . . . ? " It was a phenomenon that had been exercising Carruthers &; Carruthers for some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to adjust to these young men out of law school . " " Yes ? " Young men fresh from the law school , said Stanton Carruthers in a tone that would peel paint , had high ideals . They wanted to contribute to society . They wanted to do good . As a corollary , they did not wish to work eight hours a day in the hope of rising in their firms and achieving sordid material gain . " But Willard , " Stanton Carruthers said heavily , " is not a youngster . " No , Thatcher agreed , he was not .  | " For twenty years , " Stanton Carruthers continued , " Willard has been perfectly happy in his normal work . He has , in fact , become the outstanding authority in his field . If ever there was a man who was steady , it was Willard . " ' What , Thatcher inquired , was Ericson 's field of speciali-zation ? " Resale price maintenance , " said Stanton Carruthers loftily . " What Willard does n't know about resale price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can touch him on the Robinson-Patman Act . " Thatcher thought he was beginning to understand , but Carruthers spelled it out . Pure chance had led Willard Ericson to his first sight of wider legal horizons , pure chance in the form of a son-in-law . The son-in-law was a youthful Catholic lawyer retained to advise the St. Bernadette 's Parents League . An idle remark at Sunday dinner , the benevolent interest of the older , experienced lawyer , a suggestion , a neat little ploy  --  and Ericson had the bit between his teeth . The son-in-law went back to nursing an infant practice ; Willard , gripped by blood lust , was exploring the outer reaches of the law with the delight of a child in a candy shop . " And who can blame him ? " Thatcher murmured incautiously , thus affronting Stanton Carruthers again . To the outsider it seemed reasonable enough . You did not have to be exceptionally youthful to feel that there are more things in heaven and earth than the Robinson-Patman Act . " You know the only thing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left Carruthers and were setting back to their respective offices . Thatcher expressed cautious interest . " Fight the good fight , " said Robichaux mournfully . " I am certainly willing to try , " Thatcher replied . " And I think I can assure you that many others are as well . "  | Among them , as Thatcher had reason to know , were Willard Ericson and the surviving members of the St. Bernadette 's Parents League . Ericson could not attend the committee meeting that evening . But although absent in flesh , he was very much present in spirit . " ... so , " said Mary Foster , looking around the dining room table , " when Mr. Ericson called , I said that I 'd go along with him . You were at work , Bob , and I could n't get in touch with you , Pat . . . " There was a confused murmur . " No , you did the right thing , Mary . " " Do you think maybe the Sloan will help us out ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mary Foster frowned . " I do n't even know that the Sloan can help much . But Mr. Ericson says that they might give us a little time . That 's all we need . " Horvath looked down at large , work-hardened hands . " So we can go on fighting . " 69  | Again a murmur of support and approval . Nevertheless , Horvath sounded dogged . " Not that I understand anything about these lawsuits . " He rubbed the back of his neck in a spasm of discontent . " Hell , I guess I do n't understand much  --  dammit ! " " Bob ! " Ruthie protested automatically . Neither Mary nor Pat Ianello noticed . Both were thinking deeply . The fifth person present in the Horvath dining room spoke up . " Of course , I 'm not a member of the committee , " said Sal Ianello , as thin and dark as Horvath was large and sandy . " But I think it 's your duty , Bob . " " You 're one hundred percent right , Sal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Coffee , everybody ? I 'll get some . " She left silence behind her . Sal Ianello and the committee had hit an unexpected difficulty . " It 's just that . . . " Horvath broke off , then continued He knew how to get things done . And he made it easy for the rest of us . Look at the way he rented headquarters out in a rush . " It 's going to be hard to manage without Frank . of his own pocket ! " " But we have to manage without him ! We can drum up the rent somehow . " Pat Ianello was fierce . " Saving St. Bernadette 's would be the best tribute we could pay Frank . " " That 's right , " said Ruthie , sincerely moved by the sentiment . She had returned with a tray , cups and a large cake . " Let me help you , " said Mary Foster , rising . She sounded tired . Bob Horvath watched them with a stubborn scowl . " Why the hell would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burst out . " Who would do a thing like that ? I just ask you ! " It was a question that hung over Flensburg like a pall . Both the Ianellos looked sober . But it was Mary Foster who replied .  | " Who knows , Bob ? And we may never know ! But no good will come from sitting around brooding about it . " " That 's right , " said Pat . Ruthie nodded vigorously . Mary stirred her coffee reflectively . " I think the only thing we can do is go on . Leave Frank 's murder to the police . . " " And to God , " said Ruthie solemnly . In the respectful silence , the front door slammed . " Jerry ! " said Ruthie , jumping to her feet . " That boy ! I told him seven-thirty sharp . At the latest ! " Still talking , she rushed off to scold her son . A sharp exchange filtered back from the hallway . Horvath shifted uncomfortably . Normally he would be fending off demands that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But normally , he would be watching television . Not holding a committee meeting . " I suppose somebody better talk to the police while they 've got our headquarters locked , " he said aloud . " God , all those questionnaires are going to be mailed back to the store  --  what a mess ! " " It 's a good thing you thought of that , " said Pat quickly . " I can go down to the post office and arrange to pick things up there . " Mary was just as brightly encouraging . " And I 've got the master list at my place . So we can get to work on the answers even if we ca n't use headquarters . " Horvath shook his head . He was a man who did not like to be pressured . And if this was n't pressure , what was ? Sal Ianello was less indirect than the ladies . " Bob , be reasonable , " he urged . " It 's your place to be chairman . " Horvath still struggled . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mary Foster just looked at him .  | " Okay , okay , " he said gruffly . Bob Horvath had just succeeded Frank Omara as chairman of the St. Bernadette 's Parents League . " I still think you 're crazy , " he muttered . It had been clear to Horvath , and he assumed to Pat and Mary , that the right person to take over was Mary Foster . She was the kind of woman who knew how to run things . She could talk without getting red in the face or clenching her fists . Simply thinking about going down to Ericson 's office made Bob Horvath feel hot and clumsy . Ruthie had clued him in while she was doing the dinner dishes before the committee arrived . " Oh , I do n't know , " she had said vaguely . " What do you mean ? Mary 's a damned smart woman . " Nobody had ever described Ruthie as damned smart , but she knew better than to let her husband see what she made of that . Instead , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks better to have a man standing up for the parents . " Horvath had tilted back the kitchen chair . As Ruthie began putting dishes away , he explained how things were changing . Ruthie had to keep up with the times . In the old days  --  well , maybe she would have been right . But these days , people wanted the best man for the job , even if the best man was a woman . " Sure , honey , " Ruthie had said equably . " Only after what happened to Frank  --  well , you can imagine what people will say , ca n't you ? " Horvath had not considered that viewpoint . He was ready to expostulate when the doorbell rang . And in short order he learned that Ruthie had not been far off the mark . Unanimous as they were about continuing to fight , the committee was split on the question of the chairmanship . The split was two to one . Mary herself was the least vehement . " No , I always as-  | sumed you 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . Oh , do n't be silly ! We all do what we can . No one works harder than you do . . . . Honestly , if I 'd thought going to the Sloan this morning would make all this fuss , I 'd have waited for you to go . " Pat Ianello was more forthright . " Bob , I think you should ! " She was tense with the effort of trying to communicate more than she was willing to put into words . Bob was torn . It was easier said than done  --  this putting Frank Omara 's murder from one 's mind . And much as he disliked the idea of trying to fill Frank Omara 's shoes , Horvath was prey to other , older instincts . Bob Horvath , husband , father , truck driver and Teamster , came from a long line of men who knew what men should do , in new times as well as old . If there was any possibility that Frank Omara had been killed because of the Parents League  --  then it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Not Mary Foster . " Okay , okay , " he repeated , bowing to the inevitable . " But you 're all going to have to help out . First off , we 'd better get hold of Mr. Ericson and find out what the Sloan says . Then we 've got to get a lot of new volunteers . Tell them it 's for Frank  --  God rest his soul ! " Horvath still sounded truculent . Sal misinterpreted him . " That 's the way to talk ! " " I 'm proud of you , " said Ruthie . Goaded , the hero looked around . " Some people still do n't see it our way , " he said . " About going against the Cardinal . We need all the help we can get . " There was unanimity on that point . Then , Bob Horvath moved on to new business : " As long as we 're here , " he said gruffly , " I guess we 'd better make our plans . " He had succeeded in outstripping his followers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blankly . Bob stared at her . Maybe there was something in this business about a man 's mind . " About the funeral , Mary , " he told her , surprised . " We 've got to decide , right here and now , how we 're going to handle the funeral . " " You 're right , " said Mary , her eyes narrowing . Nobody said anything further . Because everybody present realized just how right Bob Horvath was . Frank Omara 's funeral was going to be a challenge to any number of people . But Dick Unger , for one , was scarcely ready to meet any challenge with his usual suavity . After recovering from his police interrogation , he re-emerged as a real estate promoter . Almost as quickly as Willard Ericson , he appreciated that the death of Francis Omara equaled the death of Francis P. Omara vs . Joseph , Cardinal Devlin . To his mind , the appropriate conduct for Unger Realty , the Archdiocese of New York and the Sloan Guaranty Trust was so obvious as to require @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said cheerfully over the longdistance line to the Caribbean . " If we step on it , the sale will be over before those parents know what hit them . Then they ca n't talk about an injunction any more . " The phone suggested that there were other ways of fighting besides injunctions . " No , no , Dad . Once they 're faced with an accomplished fact , they 'll accept it . You 'll see . " But Unger senior had no opportunity to see . Almost before he cradled the receiver , Dick Unger was on another line learning that the Sloan had frozen his mortgage funds until after a new suit could be filed . " God knows why ! " he almost wailed to Monsignor Miles an hour later . " Thatcher must be crazy ! " Monsignor Miles raised fine eyebrows in rebuke . This  | was a signal which his colleagues and subordinates recognized . Unfortunately Unger did not . " We could have slipped the whole thing through , " Unger continued to lament , " without anyone even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was going to be necessary . " They would certainly have noticed afterwards , " he said sharply . Dick Unger 's expression spoke for itself . " What difference would that make to the Sloan ? " he asked harshly . " I do not know , but it would make a good deal of difference to both the Church and to Unger Realty . In all fairness to Mr. Thatcher , I should say that we would never have agreed to exploiting Mr. Omara 's death in that fashion . We shall certainly give the Parents League an opportunity to reorganize and appoint another chairman . " Dick Unger was still rebellious . Monsignor Miles turned out to be more adept at handling this mutiny than the one in Flensburg . " If , by any chance , their reorganization is accomplished within the next day or two , we shall still not act . Nothing will be done until after Francis Omara 's funeral . It is the least mark of respect we can show , Mr. Unger . By the way , what are you planning to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing ! " said Dick Unger firmly .  | John Putnam Thatcher arrived at his office early the next morning with laudable intentions . There were many claims on the time of the acting president of the Sloan Guaranty Trust besides St. Bernadette 's School . He thought these hopes were reasonable ; he had given St. Bernadette 's more Sloan attention than it absolutely deserved in these days of financial Sturm and Drang . None of the interested parties ? and Thatcher had no qualms about including Miss Corsa in this roster  --  could complain that their demands had received short shrift . He was immediately reminded that if there is a reward for virtue , it lies in a better world . " What was that , Miss Corsa ? " he asked . He had not yet reached his own desk . " Mr. Unger , " she repeated . " I said you would pick him up at quarter to ten . " Thatcher waited for enlightenment . " The funeral , " Miss Corsa explained patiently . " I knew you would want to attend . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " 76  | Thatcher was momentarily tempted to challenge her . He knew that his age and station were accelerating the occasions for these gestures of respect . But that was no excuse for Miss Corsa to assume he enjoyed this sort of thing . Second thoughts , however , prevailed . It was all too likely , he feared , that Miss Corsa had opinions of her own about Francis Omara 's funeral . Thus , within the hour , he found himself Flensburg-bound with Dick Unger . Unger , for once , seemed disinclined for conversation . Thatcher absorbed his companion 's sartorial splendor . Unger was , at all times , something of a dandy . His sideburns artfully elongated his face and his tailoring smacked of the Edwardian . Nor was he usually somber . Cheery waistcoats peeked out over his lapels ; his ties were exotic exercises in contrast . Today , however , he was a muted symphony . The light gray of socks and shirt underlined the darker gray of tailoring . The whole ensemble was enriched by a tie of deepest purple . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The uniform of banking  --  a conservative business suit  --  was perfectly proper for funeral attendance . And what a commentary on the American businessman that was ! They were speeding up Jackson Boulevard when Unger finally unburdened himself . " If you ask me , Monsignor Miles is making a mistake , " he said sourly . Thatcher indicated interest . " He 's emphasizing the connection between Omara 's murder and St. Bernadette 's , " Unger expanded . " If we played our cards right , everybody would forget it . " Thatcher did not agree with him , but just then they arrived at the church . The crowd streaming in relieved him of any necessity for comment . He and Unger had arrived early but still had to be seated on a side aisle . The pews were filling rapidly . Low-voiced exchanges on all sides indi-  | cated that the entire parish was turning out and taking a deep interest . " Look at old Mr. Omara , " said somebody behind Thatcher . " He 's handling the funeral , of course . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the front pew where an elderly man supported the black-veiled widow . They were flanked by children . But if the first pew was reserved for the family , the second pew was also set apart . It presented the Action Committee of the St. Bernadette 's Parents League in solid array . Pat and Sal Ianello sat together in the center . Mary Foster and Bob Horvath were both accompanied by spouses and teenage children . Most surprising of all were the other occupants of the pew  --  Willard Ericson and a young man Thatcher took to be his son-in-law . Without them , the seating might be accidental . With them , it became a show of solidarity . Others thought so , too . On every side there were decorous whisperings . " The two on the end must be the lawyers . Rita said they were coming . " " That 's to show they mean to go on with the fight . " " Did you hear that Ruthie wants them to get guards for Horvath ? " " You 're kidding ! " The whisper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afraid it might happen again . " An indignant newcomer spoke up . " Again ? Where do they think we are ? This is Flensburg . " It was not only behind him , Thatcher noted . In front of him , the conversation was running on much the same lines . " You have to face facts . We 've got some kind of kook in the parish . " " We 've got more than one kind . You notice Kavanaugh is n't here . " " At least they 've finally muzzled Father James . That was after he said this was a judgment . "  | The woman was outraged . " And high time ! He said it in the churchyard . Poor Kathleen Omara might have heard him . She came to early Mass . " " And young Pete was with her . " Further comment was postponed as the organ pealed forth . The congregation turned its mind to its devotions , and the solemn rites began . Thatcher observed with curiosity the priest who came forward to greet the casket . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known Francis Omara since childhood . This proved to be the case . Father Doyle 's eulogy opened with a reference to his long affection for his fallen parishioner . He had known him since he was a boy . But the eulogy moved on from the personal virtues of Francis Omara to his commitment to his parish and to the well-being of the people among whom he lived . " He was ready to strive for betterment , " Father Doyle said , " but only in peace . To the very last he recognized the honesty of those he disagreed with . He knew that there is no betterment where dissension and hatred follow in its wake . " From there the eulogy naturally passed into a moving plea for charity . If disagree you must , ran its theme , then take Francis Omara 's conduct as a guide . He was a Christian , he was a Catholic , he was an example to us all . And we are bereft without him . There was absolute silence at the end except for quiet weeping from several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recover from his own emotion . Then he was able to make an announcement in a normal voice . The silence turned to gasps of surprise . There would be a second eulogy , delivered by Monsignor Miles at the express request of Joseph , Cardinal Devlin . Monsignor Miles ascended the pulpit with the assurance of his station . " I can not lighten your grief , " he spoke almost conver-  | sationally . " I can only share it . It is natural and right that we should grieve for the passing of a good man , a sincere man . " The text of his address might have been The Sincere Man . Monsignor Miles was an able speaker . He did full justice to the occasion , bypassing all controversial issues . He spoke warmly of the dead man and emphasized the Church 's need for concerned , active laymen . His speech was urbane , conciliatory and consistent . It said everything that ought to be said and nothing that ought not to be said . In John Putnam Thatcher 's view , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and consistency . Most of all it did not want any suggestion of forgiveness . Francis Omara 's sincerity , Monsignor Miles implied , made his error acceptable . But the parish of St. Bernadette 's wanted to avoid considering error . They were much happier with Father Doyle , who gave them genuine emotion and asked , in turn , for genuine charity . Thatcher glanced at the second row . Pat Ianello who , a short time ago , had been dabbing gently at her eyes , was transformed . Her chin was up and she glared militantly straight ahead . Sal Ianello 's face was obscured , but his back was ramrod straight . Bob Horvath looked tense . Whatever his reaction , his wife had put a restraining hand on his arm . Mary Foster was the most contained member of the committee . But she too had stowed away her handkerchief and seemed to be measuring the pulpit with a cool , appraising eye . Monsignor Miles was no doubt a skilled troubleshooter . But in this instance , Thatcher decided , he would be welladvised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parish priest was the man to do the local work . Possibly Miles himself was beginning to sense this . He certainly brought his remarks to a close more abruptly than gracefully , to retire in favor of Father Doyle .  | By the end of the Mass , Father Doyle had almost managed to recreate the atmosphere of priest and parishioner . This was no mean feat as Thatcher saw once they were outside the church again . The greater part of the congregation was paying its respects to the casket before returning to its daily round . The cavalcade began sorting itself out for the trip to the cemetery . In the milling , Thatcher registered for the first time how unusual Francis Omara 's funeral was  --  Monsignor Miles quite apart . Children from St. Bernadette 's School lined up and were marched off by the lay teachers . The nuns were going to the interment en bloc . The Knights of Columbus were also present in tight formation . Thatcher assumed that a wedge of young clergymen were from archdiocesan headquarters and formed Monsignor Miles 's retinue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city-wide Catholic groups . Naturally enough there was a large delegation from the morticians ' trade association . After the hearse pulled away from curbside , there was a general pause . The Omaras had taken their places in two cars , but until they were actually in motion , bystanders were reluctant to stride away . Thatcher had the opportunity to greet members of the Parents League . After suitable condolences and introductions , conversation resumed . " I know you 're on the Cathedral 's side , Mr. Thatcher , " Pat Ianello said doggedly , " but I do n't think it was right for Monsignor Miles to talk that way . " Thatcher disclaimed any partisanship , but he did not try to change the subject . It was clear that the Parents League was burning to air its grievances . And Dick Unger did not seem to have much to say today . " I do n't pretend to understand the implications of Monsignor Miles 's appearance today , " Thatcher went on , " but I gathered from what Father Doyle said that it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I suppose the Monsignor did n't have any choice . " " He had a choice what to say , " Bob Horvath rumbled . " What difference does it make ? " Larry Foster sounded bored . " The Cardinal decided or the Monsignor did . Either way you could n't expect him to speak as if he knew Omara . " " He knew Frank was murdered , " Horvath replied contemptuously . " That should be enough . " Mary Foster intervened hastily . " I do n't know why Monsignor Miles decided to give a speech like that . Usually you give a man the benefit of the doubt when he 's been a victim . But I can tell you one thing , Mr. Thatcher . He 's made things a lot easier for us . " Thatcher saw his chance to put in a word for the Sloan . " So have we , " he reminded her . For a moment she was confused . Then she saw his point . She turned to her husband . " You were n't home when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has agreed to freeze the mortgage funds until we can change our suit . " " That 's good , " Foster said . Sal Ianello was still interested in an earlier remark . " You mean , Mary , that people will be mad enough at that eulogy to stick up for us ? " " Even the ones who think we 're acting out of turn do n't like somebody from outside the parish saying so , " Mary pointed out . " And they 're right . " Pat was very earnest . " We 're the ones who have a problem . We 're the ones who 'll suffer if St. Bernadette 's is closed . And Frank Omara was the man who was killed . " Dick Unger made the mistake of drawing attention to himself . There was , he said , no proof that Omara 's death had anything to do with St. Bernadette's.  | Six Catholic parents surveyed him incredulously . Then they silently dismissed his words . " Yeah , " Bob Horvath said , as if Unger had not spoken , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this . " " That two-bit bum , " sneered Larry Foster with his first show of interest . " He 's just hoping to make a fast buck from that lousy candy store of his when they put up this high-rise across the street from him . " Ruthie Horvath had her mite to contribute . " I keep telling Bob that Kavanaugh is a lot smarter than he gives him credit for . " At this point , the discussion showed signs of disintegrating into a general denunciation of the unknown Kavanaugh . One voice said that Kavanaugh had no children , another that he was a born troublemaker , and a third that he was filling Father James with a lot of garbage . But Sal Ianello rode the whirlwind and focused everybody 's attention . " He 'll have to watch his step anyway , " he said as one who invokes the obvious . Ruthie Horvath was puzzled . " What do you mean , Sal ? " " I mean that someone in this parish was crazy enough to kill Frank Omara for leading the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much sense , but he 's got enough sense to know that this is n't the time to be advertising himself as our leading maniac . " " I hope you heard that , Unger , " Thatcher remarked pleasantly as they made their way to the limousine . " I did , and I did n't like it . " Thatcher was pleased to see anxiety on Unger 's face . Normally he preferred his fellow men to enjoy life . But when a tornado loomed on the horizon , he wanted to deal with men who were intelligent enough to head for the cellar .  | " Virtually everyone in that church was certain that Omara was killed in his capacity as head of the Parents League . " " They may be wrong , " Unger said stubbornly . " Granted . Although I think the possibility is remote . But what worries me is the way they assume that the parish harbors the murderer as well as the victim . " " You mean you believe what those people were saying ? That Horvath will be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devoutly trust not . Although I should warn you . No amount of profit for the Sloan can persuade me to encourage a situation where one person after another is being murdered . " " Me neither , " said Unger . " But things are probably not that bad . What I had in mind is a situation where the parish begins to break under the strain . So far everyone has behaved with great propriety . I do not think you can expect that to last for long . " Unger chewed his underlip . " This is a lot of private gossip so far , " he pointed out . " The publicity has n't been bad . I suppose the police handouts were pretty tame . The papers have n't really played up the connection between the murder and St. Bernadette 's . " " How long do you think that will continue ? " Thatcher asked incisively . " Under these conditions ? With thousands of people talking about that connection ? " " You think something 's going to blow ? " Unger sounded wary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " No , I did n't , " Thatcher replied impatiently . " I do n't know where the blow will come from . I do know one thing . This parish resembles a huge pile of explosives . The fuse was laid with the murder of Francis Omara . All we need now is for a single person to come along with a match ! "  | Unknown to John Thatcher , the match was already burning merrily in his office . And in St. Patrick 's Cathedral , Unger Realty Corporation , and the mailbox of Mr. and Mrs. Larry Foster . Protected by ignorance Thatcher was able to pass the rest of the trip back to Manhattan in reviewing what he had just seen . Parochial , he decided , is an adjective too often used pejoratively . The services for Francis Omara had been for a man of his parish  --  not for an important man in an important position . But his widow was not alone today in her grief . It was not only her church that would support Kathleen Omara , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thatcher knew , this was almost , but not quite , anachronistic . There were still oases where human relationships had not succumbed to depersonalizing forces . St. Bernadette 's parish in Flensburg , New York , was a genuine community . What chance did it have when compared to a picturesque small town in Vermont ? Few people 85  | recognize simple virtues in working-class parishes , in sodalities , in Knights of Columbus . In fact , Thatcher decided as he alighted from the limousine , any visible sign of communitas invariably provokes derogatory comment unless it coincides with a rustic landscape . He reached his office to find Miss Corsa , whose own community in Queens was largely composed of relatives , placing the current copy of Time on his desk . Since Miss Corsa never departed from custom without cause , he accepted this as an assignment . Time 's cover was so vibrantly pointillist that its subject remained problematical . Foreseeing that their message of sizzling purple and pink dots might elude readers , the editors had printed a strip translation across the right-hand corner . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interested in page eighty , " said Miss Corsa . " Thank you , " said Thatcher , riffling rapidly . He was relieved that Miss Corsa did not expect him to study the entire article . As a steady reader of the metropolitan press , he felt he had already given schools , parochial and otherwise , as much attention as could reasonably be expected . Moreover , he had three grown children who were giving school problems of one sort and another dawn-to-dusk coverage on a year-round basis . Somebody had to reserve some thought for adult life and activity . He should not have underestimated Miss Corsa . Page eighty did not deal with preparing youth for life . It hit closer to home . Red lines boxed off two columns and a photograph . The photograph depicted St. Bernadette 's School .  | DEATH COMES TO A CATHOLIC , said the headline . Thatcher sped through the item with mounting interest . The St. Bernadette 's controversy was explained with a wealth of reference to " cigar-chewing druggist Phil McInerney " and " Sister Mary Leonard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reader was given a powerful insight into the municipal woes of Flensburg , from tardy snow removal through inadequate garbage collection to high taxes . The knockout punch came in the last paragraph . It was a tribute to Time 's ability to accommodate late-breaking news . Last week , sharply divided Flensburg was dismayed by the eruption of violence . Parents League chairman and founder , forty-two-year-old Francis Omara , was found murdered in the League 's makeshift office on Jackson Boulevard . While police hunt leads , plenty of pious Catholic parents in Flensburg think Frank Omara died a martyr 's death for the good of his cause . " Oh , oh ! " said Thatcher . He felt sorry for a large number of people , from Dick Unger to the Cardinal . Given Time 's circulation , Frank Omara , who in life had belonged to his parish , was in death going to become part of the bigger scene . And John Putnam Thatcher had no illusions about what that meant . Neither did Monsignor Miles . The first issue of Time to cross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ libelous ! " thundered Bishop Shuster . For a moment he was at a loss for words to express the enormity of Time 's implication . " They might just as well come out and say we killed him ! " " They could n't mean that ! " Henry Stonor was stuttering in dismay .  | " I wonder , " said Monsignor Miles with a frown , " how many people in Flensburg think exactly that . " He effectively silenced the room . His colleagues gaped at him until he became aware of his unfortunate choice of words . " No , no , of course I do n't mean they think we picked up a butcher 's mallet . But do they think Francis Omara was killed because of his opposition to our plans ? " There was an uneasy silence . Everyone recognized that the Monsignor wanted an answer . No one wished to provide it . Finally a lesser cleric mumbled that some people would always choose the most uncharitable interpretation of events . Monsignor Miles 's eyes were half hooded as he considered this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at last , " those people may be right . " " That is unthinkable ! " Stonor sputtered . Miles was sharper than he intended to be . " I 'm afraid we 're going to have to think about it , Henry . This " ? he flicked Time with a bony forefinger ? " makes it necessary . " Bishop Shuster , now that he was really alarmed , was quieter . " How much damage do you think this will do ? " Miles was almost curt . " It will make a bad situation worse . " In Flensburg the Fosters were the first to see the bad news . Unlike Bishop Shuster , Mary Foster became sharper with anxiety . " Good heavens , Larry ! " she almost screamed . " Do n't you see what this will stir up ? " Larry had taken off his funeral clothes and was slipping into a sports jacket . " Things are already stirred up , " he said absently . " Say , Mary , I think I 'll take off for a couple of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? "  | She could not help raising her voice . " Millions of people will read this ! We 're not going to be able to keep this in the parish . . . " " Oh , it wo n't be as bad as all that , " he said , his hand on the door . " It 'll be worse , " she predicted . But he had already gone . By the next day , unhappiness had spread to the British West Indies . " Hi , Dad , " said Dick Unger to the telephone . " How 's your weather down there ? " The telephone erupted . " Sure , Dad , we 're keeping on top of the situation .. . yes . . . yes , I can see that this wo n't do us any good . " Again the telephone took over . The junior Unger looked wildly around his empty office . " No , " he said , " I am not making any foolish mistakes . " The phone cut in . " Absolutely , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father 's . " I can see trouble coming as well as you can . " Forecasting may not be an exact science , but when there is general agreement that the bottom is still a long way down , that prognosis is usually correct . More trouble did , indeed , come to St. Bernadette 's . It was the shape and form that were surprising . Pat Ianello was looking in open fright at the visitor from Scarsdale sitting opposite her in League headquarters . Then , with an effort , she forced herself to speak . " But , Mrs. Kirk , I 'm afraid that it just wo n't do for us . . . " Mrs. Kirk was a slim young woman with long , straight blond hair , square glasses , a shaggy coat and a floor-length scarf . Within ten minutes , Mrs. Kirk had convinced Pat that  | she was a woman born to manage . There , however , her resemblance to Mary Foster stopped . Mary was competent and level-headed . At the same time she was comfortably down-to-earth . Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moral elevation . She was also paralyzingly fluent . Ignoring Pat 's interjection , she continued her lecture .

But we will not allow ourselves to be relegated to the nineteenth century . The American hierarchy is the most conservative  --  even reactionary  --  in the world ! " Pat Ianello held up a defensive hand . Mrs. Kirk was unstoppable . " The whole trick , you see , is to know how to mount your protest . There 's where we can help . Jane Brady has worked with Women Strike for Peace , and her husband is very close to George McGovern ... " Pat uttered a strangled protest . Mrs. Kirk looked kindly at her . " Why , you do n't even have pickets out , " she said , making her criticism humorous . " That 's no way to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ managed to say , " we do not want pickets .

" We 're here to help , and we 're going to help . " She was outweighed , Pat knew . She looked yearningly at the telephone . If ever she needed help , it was now . And not the variety Mrs. Kirk was offering . For pacing slowly up and down across the street , in front of St. Bernadette 's , were ten of Mrs. Kirk 's cohorts . Like  | her , they wore hairy outerwear and came from socially aware suburbs . But it was not goatskin jackets that were halting traffic on Jackson Boulevard . It was the placards .

It was Ruthie Horvath . " Pat ! " she said breathlessly . " Have you seen what 's going on outside ? Where did they come from ? You should hear Kavanaugh ! " Coolly , Mrs. Kirk introduced herself and explained that her group , the National Laity for Birth Control Reform , was  | ready to lend a fraternal hand to its beleaguered allies . The Flensburg Parents League , she said , not in so many words , could obviously use some expertise . Ruthie was impressed either by the fuzzy scarf or by the overly distinct enunciation . " I do n't think Bob is going to think this is such a good idea , " she replied dubiously . Mrs. Kirk smiled , still kindly . " In the last analysis , birth control and education are issues of particular interest to Catholic women , are n't they ? Who has the babies ? Who wants them to get the very best education available to them ? " Ruthie Horvath was good nature itself , but she could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it all by themselves , let me tell you , " she pointed out . She evoked only tolerance for a quaintly outdated philosophy . Ruthie then dug her hole deeper . " I still say Bob is n't going to like this , Pat . From the look on Phil Kavanaugh 's face , you 'd think somebody was giving away ten-dollar bills . " Pat made a valiant effort . " Look , Mrs. Kirk , " she said , flushed with earnestness , " we do appreciate your . . . your offer to help . But I really do n't think that Flensburg .. . that we . . . " But getting through to Mrs. Kirk was going to require heavier guns . Fortunately , just then , the front door opened again . Pat turned , first relieved , then dismayed . God had produced reinforcements , in the form of Mary Foster . But hard on her heels was Father Doyle . " .. . and , Father , I do n't see how you can think we 're doing this ! We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that circus out there ? " Mary cried . Helplessly Pat waved at Mrs. Kirk .  | Still unruffled , Mrs. Kirk prepared to speak . She did not get an opportunity to do so . " Whoever you are , " said Mary Foster , " you get those troublemakers out of there ! " " Attagirl ! " said Ruthie . Father Doyle was staring around , bewildered . Finally he turned to Pat . " Patricia ! " he cried . " Surely you 're not behind this vulgarity . " Pat was perilously close to tears , but Mrs. Kirk was made of sterner stuff . She did not knuckle under to authority  --  in any form . " Those are mature and dedicated Catholic churchwomen , Father , " she informed him . " We are deeply  --  vitally  --  concerned about our Church . For you to call it vulgarity simply proves how out-of-contact too many parish priests are with the problems the modern Catholic faces ! " Father Doyle paused to marshal his rebuttal , but Mary Foster was in before him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have your battles , and we have ours . We do n't want you . Get those women out of here ! " Mrs. Kirk was human after all . " You need plenty of help , " she snapped back . " Whether you know it or not . You 're twenty years behind the times ! " Mary narrowed her eyes . " Oh , I am , am I ? " Father Doyle slapped the desk with an aged hand . " You should be ashamed of yourself ! " " . . . trying to maintain some liberal contact with reality . You people have n't scratched the surface ... " " Listen , lady bountiful . Just get out of here and leave us alone ! " " ... the whole fabric of modern Catholicism ... " Ruthie had wandered to the window . " Hey , " she said , al-  | though everybody else was too occupied to listen . " They 've got a TV truck out there now . They 're taking pictures . Oh God , there 's Kavanaugh giving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's going to hit the ceiling . " Mary Foster , color rising , was glaring down at Mrs. Kirk . " Look , Mrs. Kirk , " she said , fighting to be reasonable . " Surely you realize all you 're doing with your birth control bunch is making new enemies for us . We 're not interested in birth control . We simply want to save St. Bernadette 's . A lot of people who care about the school do n't want to get involved in anything else . " " May I remind you . . . " Father Doyle began . But Mrs. Kirk was just as adept at ignoring the clergy . " That 's the trouble , " she cried hotly . " People do n't want to get involved . Do n't you people realize that there will never be any progress for Catholics until we get rid of this ridiculous sex hang-up ? How can you honestly tell people that they 're committing a mortal sin if they take the Pill ? How can you order a wife to say no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is sacred ! And that marriage is a sacrament ! We 've got to get this all out in the open ! Otherwise there 's no hope for the Church ! " She silenced three of her audience . Father Doyle and Mary Foster , in separate ways , realized that reasoning would make no impression here . He stood , silent , angry , and disapproving . Mary , characteristically , was racking her brain for other weapons . Pat Ianello , roughly of an age with Mrs. Kirk , had just realized what you people meant to Mrs. Kirk ; the picture of herself as an ignorant peasant left her speechless with rage . Bob 's Ruthie took up the cudgels . She did n't do a bad job . " I can see how you get a kick out of running around getting a lot of publicity , " she said placidly . " Some people like to get their pictures in the paper and get on TV . After all , we all like a little excitement . Breaks up the monotony ,  | that 's what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backyard . Nobody wants you here . " Ruthie herself sounded rather kind now . " We 've got problems enough of our own . So why do n't you just go back to where you came from ? " Mrs. Kirk lifted an already lofted chin . " What matters to us , " she proclaimed , " is that we do the right thing for Catholics everywhere ! " Father Doyle was trying to force himself to deal with this iniquitous folly when the next invader appeared . A stocky man entered , doffed his Cossack hat , and proceeded to hurl fuel on the fire . " The St. Bernadette 's Parents League , I presume ? My name is George Carew . I represent the Metropolitan Council of Concerned Catholic Laymen . We have been following the situation here in Flensburg very closely and wish to offer you our wholehearted aid and assistance . This is no idle offer . Our mobile bookmobile has been assigned to St. Bernadette 's parish for the duration . Our emergency units have been alerted ... "  | The first gusts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ redirection of most participants in the St. Bernadette 's controversy . At archdiocesan headquarters , Monsignor Miles had little time for parochial schools . Telephone and cable wires between New York and Rome hummed ceaselessly . Policy sessions met on a nonstop basis . Vigilant eyes monitored all communications media . Henry Stonor launched one counter-salvo after another . For the St. Bernadette 's Parents League , it was all a rude shock . Gone was any possibility of a modest solution achieved through private negotiations . In the world of wire services and roving television reporters , a little cause was going to sink without a ripple . How could they survive ? Should they seek powerful allies ? Most important of all , would anybody find time to listen to them ? Their problems were endless . The most dramatic realignment took place at the rectory of St. Bernadette 's . There Father Doyle , who had been a not-so-silent supporter of the laity against the hierarchy , swung around to wholehearted support of the Cardinal . For 96  | a man of his age and habits , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was not the only priest to make a U-turn . Father James had found a new issue . And all domestic comfort at the rectory was ended . " I know I am sixty-eight years old , " said Father Doyle gratingly to an old friend . " But when that young man talks to me about the burden of chastity , it would be more polite if he recognized that I know what it is ! " Dick Unger was watching these swirls of passion from afar . Amidst all the shifting of position , he thought it might be possible to nudge a parcel of prime real estate nearer to his hands . " I could see the Parents League was in trouble , " he later explained to Thatcher . " Nobody else was paying any attention to them , so I thought it was worth a try . At first they did n't want to go along . " " You can see what he 's up to , " Mary Foster said irritably . " Why should we go and see this development of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things to do . " Bob Horvath screwed up his eyes and studied the letter laboriously . " He says it will give us an opportunity to see for ourselves how one of his projects has upgraded a community , " he quoted . " On Staten Island ? " Ruthie made it sound like Idaho . " It 's part of the city , " her husband said with the truck driver 's command of geography . " It does n't make any difference where it is . " Mary Foster kept to the point . " We 're not interested . " " Oh , I do n't know , " Sal Ianello said thoughtfully . " We do n't care about upgrading communities ! We care about St. Bernadette 's ! " Pat Ianello bristled in defense of her husband . " There 's no reason to snap our heads off , Mary . " Mary passed the back of her hand across her brow . " I 'm sorry , " she apologized . " But you 'd be snapping too if you 'd    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
