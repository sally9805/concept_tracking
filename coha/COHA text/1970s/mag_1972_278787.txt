For centuries , the little town of Mauriac ( pop . 4,300 ) nestled in comfortable obscurity amid the hills of central France . Then last March , hordes of inquisitive reporters and tourists in unprecedented numbers descended upon the somber community . Mauriac became front-page news , and an estimated 10 million Frenchmen tuned in for twice-a-day radio and television broadcasts from the center of town . The occasion for all of the hoopla : in one of the largest group efforts to kick the nicotine habit , 155 citizens of Mauriac decided to give up tobacco , cold turkey. * Their effort has been largely successful . More than 100 townspeople are still abstaining , another 38 have now taken the pledge , and hundreds more have cut down on their smoking . <P> Coffin . Mauriac 's antismoking campaign was inspired by Mayor Augustin Chauvet ( who has not smoked in years ) and gleefully promoted by ORTF , the state-run TV-radio network . To launch the crusade , a four-man team of psychologists and doctors held five days of meetings designed to wean the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Member Dr. Jean Pinet passed a miniature coffin around the audience . " Put your cigarettes in it , " he exhorted , " or they 'll put you in one . " Other experts showed graphic films of the cancerous lungs of heavy smokers . The propaganda convinced many townspeople to crush out their Gauloises and pledge , " I 'll never smoke again . " <P> As the campaign began , antitobacco fervor swept through Mauriac . Gaily colored banners proclaiming IT is POSSIBLE TO STOP SMOKING , EMANCIPATE YOURSELF IN FIVE DAYS began to brighten the dreary walls of lava stone buildings . Merchants reported a rush on licorice drops , peanuts , chewing gum , after-dinner mints and other tobacco substitutes . A man of God-his own flesh too weak to relinquish the weed completely-preached a sermon of support from his pulpit in the town 's basilica . " I am not one of the courageous 155 , " acknowledged Father Leon Dumas . " But I have rationed myself down from ten to five cigarettes a day . " <P> In this convivial atmosphere , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was a slave to tobacco . I 'd drive ten miles to find a pack of cigarettes if necessary , " says Jean Maisonobe . " But I 've stopped smoking . I can hardly believe it myself . " <P> Smoking Skeptics . The crusade is not universally popular in Mauriac . " I have never slept so badly , " says Jacqueline Forgereau , a chain smoker who took the pledge . " I manage to swallow half a gallon of mineral water daily , but I ca n't stop eating . I do n't know how much longer I can keep this up . " The most fervent denunciations of all have come from some of the town 's six tobacconists , whose sales have dropped as much as 30% . <P> Despite the criticism , Mauriac 's antismoking crusade seems to have become a permanent fixture . The 143-member nonsmokers association has placed at the town 's four entrances blue-and-white signs reading MAURIAC , THE FIRST CITY IN THE WORLD TO HAVE SAID " NO " TO TOBACCO . There are already plans afoot to launch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them smokers seeking a cure , are still pouring in and bolstering local businesses-including the tobacco shops . <P>
