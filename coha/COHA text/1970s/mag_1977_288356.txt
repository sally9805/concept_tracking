Mstislav Rostropovich goes to Washington and a mad " loff " affair begins <P> All tuned up and ready to blow , the National Symphony Orchestra of Washington waited on the stage of the austere concert hall at the John F. Kennedy Center . A cheerful cherub of a man walked swiftly to the podium and smiled at the audience . His face was a pale Russian winter 's landscape , his blue eyes shone mischievously . He turned toward his colleagues and , with a sturdy slash of his baton , launched into a high-speed , raucous overture that seemed to roil the Potomac . It was strictly show-biz razzmatazz , a pastiche stitched together by Leonard Bernstein from his 1976 musical 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue . The show had not fared well on Broadway , and the music culled from it might have passed unremarked-except that the enraptured man on the podium was the renowned cellist and magnificent maestro Mstislav Rostropovich , the N.S.O. 's new permanent conductor , Washington 's grandest new monument . <P> What was a nice , " serious " musician doing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the composer had dedicated the overture to Rostropovich by way of acknowledging his arrival in Washington . The music was called Slava ! , which is not only the Russian word for glory but Rostropovich 's nickname , and it was a good way for the conductor to show Washington that he is as gifted with jazz as he is with Tchaikovsky . Rostropovich caught the spirit easily , bending his body into the music , shafting his cues with a vigorous baton , sculpting the shapes of sound with his left hand , now kneading , now pleading , now punching his fist to bring home a thunderous cluster of dissonance . <P> Slava had been glorying for two weeks . For his season 's opening the week before , he featured Rudolf Serkin in a velvety performance of Beethoven 's Fourth Piano Concerto , creating a sensitive orchestral accompaniment to Serkin 's ethereal tonalities . For the Bernstein concert , Slava took up his own instrument , while Lenny conducted his Three Meditations from " Mass " for Violoncello and Orchestra , an episodic piece that gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound , to watch his left hand flick across the finger board , his right arm streak like a bowing jet . Both programs were enlivened by the now familiar spectacle of Rostropovich leaping from his podium to kiss and hug every musician within reach . <P> Washington is of course used to spectacle , but the era of Rostropovich has no precedent , nor has it ever promised so much . For years the capital 's music-lovers have felt ignored . The great performers of the world passed through for one-nighters somewhere en route between New York , Chicago , Los Angeles , Philadelphia , Boston and even downtown Cleveland . But with the opening of the Kennedy Center in 1971 , enterprising managers began to book extended dates for the artists , and today Washington has become one of the obligatory stops for any major musician or musical group that goes on the road .
