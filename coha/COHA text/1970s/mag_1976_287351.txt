It was luck that the tomb of Tutankhamun , pharaoh of Egypt from 1334 to 1325 B.C. , escaped the predations of grave robbers over the millenniums . Largely luck too that British Archaeologist Howard Carter found the royal tomb in 1922 after 15 years of fruitless searching through the sere Valley of the Kings . Perhaps the timing was also lucky when J. Carter Brown , director of Washington 's National Gallery of Art , began negotiating with Egyptian authorities in 1974 for a U.S. showing of the tomb 's contents : a wave of pro-American feeling was just sweeping Cairo . In any case , millions of Americans will be the beneficiaries . This week a stunning show presenting 55 " Treasures of Tutankhamun " starts a six-museum tour of the U.S. at the National Gallery. * <P> Extra Tingle . The works are arranged in the order in which Howard Carter found them , lending an extra tingle to the exhibit . First comes selected contents of the tomb 's antechamber . " Wonderful things , " Carter had gasped when his candle flickered upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afterlife : alabaster cups for his wine , bejeweled amulets to ward off evil spirits , even an ivory-inlaid wooden throne to make him feel at home . But greater treasures lay ahead , as Carter discovered when he delved further into the tomb . What he saw ( and what the exhibit visitor will see ) was " strange animals , statues and gold-everywhere the glint of gold . " <P> Indeed , Tutankhamun lived during a blaze of pharaonic wealth and power . Besides their use of gold , his artists worked in silver , alabaster , obsidian , lapis lazuli , wood , glass and gems , handling each material as masterfully as if it were clay . They had turned from much of the rigid formality that marks artworks of earlier periods to more natural poses and more intimate scenes . <P> The most famous object , of course , is the golden mask that covered Tutankhamun 's mummified head . Though every bit as cool and haughty as one would expect of an art that above all aimed to celebrate majesty and death , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ golden gleam and shadow evoke a bursting inner vitality that emphatically defies mortality . <P> Despite the art 's remoteness in time , today 's audience will find in it the first stirrings of familiar Western styles . There is nothing alien about the playfulness of unguent jars shaped like animals with lolling tongues , or the alert grace of a gilded wooden statue of the goddess Selket , or the art nouveau traceries of floral patterns on a lamp and vase . A wooden seat is decorated with a leopard-spot design that has the startling freedom and bounce of Matisse 's late cutouts . <P> For all that , the treasures retain the grandeur of mystery too . A wooden head of Tutankhamun , shown as the sun-god emerging from a lotus plant in daily rebirth , stares outward with a gaze that is as candid , guileless-and impenetrably secretive-as a cat 's . Nearly every one of the 55 artworks seems a confident invocation of the idea of permanence . " To speak the names of the dead is to make them live again , " said the ancient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P>
