txt School Chancellor Irving Anker yesterday suspended the board of Community School District 26 in Queens , because it has refused ' his request for an ethnic breakdown of its students and faculty members . William H. Caulfield , the president of the suspended school board , said it would appeal the Chancellor 's decision " in the courts and with the public  --  and we will win in both areas . " The board 's policy has been that such data are divisive and lead to racial quotas . Alfredo Mathew Jr. , who was named by Mr. Anker to act as trustee to replace the board , said he would oversee the collection of ethnic data required for state and Federal aid . He said he would also apply on behalf of the district for a Federal jobs program that the board had earlier rejected ' because it would not have benefited youngsters in middle-income families , only poor children , nearly half of whom are bused into District 26 to integrate its schools . A Fruitless Meeting Mr. Anker met with the community school board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been arranged the previous day at the board 's request in an effort , to reach an agreement with the Chancellor , who had already reduced some of the board 's powers . The meeting lasted an hour and a half , and when it . ended , Mr. Anker said he was taking the action " because of my responsibility to enforce the law and as a matter of principle . " The Chancellor said the ethnic data were needed to obtain millions of dollars in Federal and state funds and because " the Government has the right to know to what extent we are or are not integrating our schools . " Community School Board 26 , elected in a middle-income and upper-middle-income section of northeastern Queens , has emerged as a spokesman for several school boards in the city that have resisted the collection of ethnic data as a violation of individual rights . Agreement Vacated Together with eight other school boards , District 26 filed a suit in Federal Court that earlier this week resulted in vacating a " memorandum of understanding " between the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Under the agreement , teachers have been assigned to schools on the basis of race and an ethnic census of teachers has been required to assure compliance . The districts have also opposed a separate ethnic census of teachers and pupils that is required for state .. and Federal subsidies . Other districts faced with suspension have complied in full or in part with these requirements , but District 26 has stood firm on its policy of refusal . Chancellor Anker said he " respected " the position of the members of the hoard . " They are doing it as a matter of conscience , " he said . But , he added , " the attack should be against the misuse of ? the data , rather than against the collect tion of the data . " Lee Goldman , a member of the dismissed board , said the community would rally round the members , who she said would be viewed as martyrs in the fight against quotas . She said she would set up a " district office in exile " at her home in Bayside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the suspension would be for an " indefinite " period , and that it could last as long as two years , the current term of the board . In the interim , he said , ho may appoint trustees who live in the school district to take over for Mr. Mathew . Extension Asked At the closed meeting in Mr. Anker 's office , the board was reported to have explained its reasons for refusing to submit the ethnic figures necessary for the completion of the Basic Educational Data Survey . The survey is required to insure millions of dollars in state aid to the district . The board members asked the Chancellor for an extension for the submission of the material at least until next Thursday . It is on that day that an appeal will be heard in the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit on part of the ruling of Judge Jack B. Weinstein in the case against the " memorandum of understanding . " The ruling vacating the agreement was only a partial victory for the board since at the same time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ injunction on the collection of ethnic data . Attorneys for the community school board reportedly told Mr. Anker that the submission of the ethnic data at this time could " prejudice the court case " by rendering the issue academic . Board Superseded Earlier Last week , Chancellor Anker superseded the board  --  that is , revoked some of its powers  --  when it refused o submit data necessary for an application for $6.2 million that was to be shared with other districts under the Emergency School Assistance Act . About $200,000 of the total was earmarked for District 26 . The funds were primarily for programs designed to promote racial integration . Mr. Anker appointed Mr. Mathew as a trustee to force compliance with regard to the Federal funds . However , school principals , encouraged by the stand of the school board and supported by their union , resisted the request for the ethnic data . Yesterday , after he was appointed trustee , Mr. Mathew was more optimistic about the collection of this material . He has already threatened principals with disciplinary action if they continue to defy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We 've already passed the official deadline , " Mr. Mathew said with regard to the application for Federal funds . " But the eats will be flown to Washington on ' Monday , and we hope it will be accepted . " The Queens board 's continued refusal to submit ethnic data In the face of a suspension was supported by six of its Me members . " Our only consolation , " said the Rev. Thomas O'Rourke , one of the dissenting members , " is that the E.S.A , A. proposal will be rushed to Washington so that the children will not be the ones to suffer . " In addition to the district 's participation in an overall $6.2 million Federal grant , Mr. Mathew said , as trustee he plans to apply directly to Washington for $1.1 million more in Emergency School Assistance Act funds . Earlier this week , the majority of the dismissed board declined to submit the necessary ethnic data to qualify for the district grant . Mr. Mathew said he would arrange to have the application for this grant also to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that as trustee he would ? also apply for the Federal jobs grant rejected in January by the school board . The program , under the Youth Employment Development Act , ' would have provided for about 50 jobs for indigent youngsters . In a letter to President Carter last month explaining ? its rejection , the board complained that the grant would " bypass " middle-income youngsters and called for Federal programs that would benefit these children as well . The board members denied any racial motivation In their action , insisting instead that they were spearheading a " middle-class revolt . " There are 27 schools with 16,000 pupils in District 26 . About a third of these youngsters are bused into the district for purposes of racial integration . The school district includes affluent areas , such as Douglaston , and middle-income areas , such as Bayside and Fresh Meadow . Mr. Mathew said that he would call a public hearing on Thursday night to comment on the proposed jobs program . give the community an opportunity to But he indicated that his mind was already made up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ board , will consider the question and most probably vote for it , " Mr. Mathew said. ? " But you have only one vote , " a reporter reminded the trustee9 " That 's right , " he answered . " And I vote for nine . "
