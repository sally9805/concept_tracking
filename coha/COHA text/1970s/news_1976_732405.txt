txt Letters to the Editor Letters to the Editor On Removing ** Rental Limits Of Corporations , Taxes And Greener Pastures To the Editor : You are more than justified in the caution expressed in your March 3 editorial on the inherent dangers of " ' swallowing in its entirety " the Sternlieb proposal for " a free market " in vacant apartments and in all units , vacant or occupied , renting above $300 a month . The 1975 Census Bureau study commissioned by the city pursuant to state law provides a much clearer perspective than does the Sternlieb Report . For example , of the approximate 156,000 units renting above $300 , a minimum of 11 percent , or roughly 17,000 units , were completed in 1974 . Approximately 9,000 of the 156,000 units were found to he vacant , thereby creating the 5.65 percent vacancy rate . Significantly , it was found that 76 percent of these vacancies were of less than three months ' duration , suggesting to the author of the study the possibility that a substantial proportion of the vacancy may have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of filling up . Even more significantly , the study found that 55 percent of the vacant units built in 1974 had a median rental of $800 per month while the remaining 45 percent had a median rental of $400 per month . It is obvious on the face of it that these vacancies in new , The Secret-Mongers To the Editor : One-half the world 's troubles are caused by men playing God . ( D10 other half are caused by God playing God , but that 's not what I 'm objecting to here . ) My complaint is with the media and their Godlike decisions about what we the people shall be permitted to know . If the media are truly devoted to " the people 's right to know , " why do they deny us the right to know who among our public servants releases classified information to unauthorized persons and for what purpose ? This is surely as Interesting and important to us as the leaked material , and we have as much right to this information as citizens who are reporters . A public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ openly as a matter of conviction and be prepared to accept both the praise and blame that follow . Otherwise , the action is at best only mischief . At its worst it displays a contempt  --  not of To the Editor : In a Feb. 29 letter , F. Brennan asks why the Social Security program 's " retirement test " ( which begins to reduce benefits when beneficiary earnings exceed $2,760 in a year ) applies only to earned income while , in his words , recipients of " accumulated investments of one kind or another that may now bring in receipts of youname-it amounts of ' unearned ' income per year are allowed to collect their full monthly benefits . Social Security is designed to provide for replacement of earned income for survivors , disabled workers and retired persons . The program is financed by direct transfers from current workers to current beneficiaries . As a matter of public policy , the retirement test is designed to prevent or reduce transfers from working people to working people , since this type of transfer is not appropriate for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ systems incorporate some mechanism to assure that taxed workers are not paying their money just to support other workers . The retirement test has frequently been criticized because it does not take into account a beneficiary 's income from such non-work sources as dividends , interest or pension payments . But if the test took account of income other than earnings from work , it would no longer be a retirement ultra-high-rental units grossly distort the true picture . In my judgment the distortion is then exaggerated and manipulated to achieve the desired result . No other word than " manipulation " can describe the lumping together of apartments renting at $300 and at $1,000 or more per month . As evidence of this it must be noted that the Census Bureau figures show that in the class of apartments renting between $250 and $299 the vacancy rate is a minuscule 1.72 percent . Logic and personal observation lead me to suspect that the vacancy rate for apartments renting between $300 and $349 , and between $350 and $399 per month is about the same . Unfortunately , because of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not have the facts . Grave social and economic consequences are inherent in removing rental limits and thereby pricing families out of . their homes and perhaps out of the city . The people of New York deserve better than to have their elected officials rush into illconsidered decisions based on incomplete information and deliberately misleading conclusions such as are to be found in the Sternlieb Report . THEODORE S. WEISS Councilman , 4th Dist. , Manhattan New York , March 5 , 1976 the Government but of the people . In giving anonymity to such a person , the media behave as arbitrarily , and arrogantly as the government . NELLE HABER Brooklyn , Feb. 24 , 1976 ? Colby and Semantics To the Editor : William Colby 's Feb. 26 Op-Ed article , " After Investigating U.S. Intelligence , " is surely a challenge to the intelligence of most Americans . Virtually the entire piece rests upon the existence and honorable behavior of an undefined someone or something he calls " intelligence . " Only in the last line is the shift made to " the best intelligence service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " intelligence " those Government agencies which conduct spying , data-gathering and covert actions against foreign governments , the limited Congressional and public scrutiny he praises has already invalidated his claim . If , on the other hand , he is referring to the data gathered , the results of spying and the long-run outcomes of covert actions , his claim is hardly justified without a much fuller disclosure of intelligence agencies and their activities  --  at the least the release of the House cornmitteo report . In light of President Ford 's recent initiatives to block forever the opportunity for accountability to anyone other than himself , Mr. Colby 's suggestion that C.I.A . stand for " constitutional intelligence for America " is an utter debasement of both the U.S. Constitution and the English language . His efforts to capitalize on a purported swing of public opinion toward secrecy and national security are clearly based on an assumption of American unintel I igence . RICHARD K. SCHARF Chicago , Feb. 27 , 1976 test but an income test , and it would discourage private savings and pensions . If it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become a welfare program . One of the strengths of Social Security is that it is not a welfare program . Every successive Advisory Council on Social Security has emphasized the importance of operating the Social Security program in a manner that does not discourage private savings and investment as additional sources of income to retired people . That such encouragement is still needed may be seen in the fact that only about 15 percent of the income of persons over 65 now comes from the yield on savings and other investments . It may well be that the burden of the retirement test does fall most heavily on low-income individuals who do not have access to private insurance , pension plans , savings or other sources of non-work income to supplement their Social Security benefits . The 1975 Quadrennial Advisory Council on Social Security has recommended changes in the retirement test that would help low-income people who work after beginning benefits and that would not cost the system more than about $600 million in 1978 . FRANCIS P. RING New York , March 2 , 1976 The writer is senior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To the Editor : It would appear that Mr. Kornfefd letter Feb. 26 has some misconceptions about the " blackmail " of New York State by corporations that are threatening to move out of the state . In the first place , he should understand that New York was for many years the very evil he so seems to despise  --  a tax shelter , albeit a corporate tax shelter . New York State 's low corporate tax rates ( up to 1968 the general rule was a 5% percent flat rate on net income with some very significant exceptions ) were clearly designed to induce corporations into the state . In just eight years these rates have nearly doubled , to 9 percent of net income , which puts New York more on a par with other states , although still lower than many . However , New York State 's personal income tax is far higher , reaching 15 percent on a taxable income of $25,000 , hardly a stupendous income for a husband and wife who both work ( and many of whom would probably be hard-pressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owning a home ) . Accordingly , the combined tax on corporate income and the income of a corporation 's employees is probably not exceeded anywhere else in the United States . And this , of course , does not even take into account the taxes imposed by New York City or the ubiquitous 2.5 percent " surcharge . " Faced with these realities , I find it hard to see how corporations ( which were induced , in part by low taxes , into New York in the first place ) can be accused of " blackmail " for pointing out that what was once an incentive has now become a liability . Rather , it would seem to me that when other states can afford to offer a more generous combined tax package to a corporation and its employees ( whose welfare and happiness , after all , is clearly a significant and proper concern for the corporation ) the corporation is , if anything , being charitable toward New York by presenting its grievances to the Commissioner of Commerce rather than moving out directly to pastures which are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me that such conduct would constitute " blackmail " only to someone who is biased or misinformed , or both . FRANK C. MCCLANAHAN 3d New York , Feb. 28 , 1976 ? Rohatyn 's ' Disservice ' To the Editor : Your March 3 issue carried a statement attributed to Felix Rohatyn to the effect that the Municipal Assistance Corporation was considering a second bond exchange relating to the so-called " moratorium . " It there were any doubt in any rational person 's mind that the so-called " moratorium " was in fact a default , Mr. Rohatyn erased that ? doubt . The statement attributed to him was that any holder of these notes " would have to have a very long life expectancy if he is to get his notes redeemed . " Mr. Rohatyn and any future financial adviser to the City of New York would also have to have a very long life expectancy to get the undersigned to invest in New York City notes , bonds or other securities . I believe that Mr. Rohatyn 's statement does a disservice to the City of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4 , 1976 ? The Noisy Conductors To the Editor : Would it not be possible to give announcers on the subway trains some minimal instruction in the use of the microphone ? Sometimes the noise they make is frighteningly loud , extremely unpleasant and ( most maddening of all ) completely unintelligible . DEO SCAASI New York , March 3 , 1976 ? Our Ailing Libraries To the Editor : The news article in your issue of Feb. 15 regarding the increased use of public libraries may have left the ca , sual reader with a misconception . Although most libraries are well-used , many are not enjoying good health . The single paragraph in your article that dealt with the financial aspects of library operations suggested that budgetary problems are widespread . What should be understood are two results of the severe financial constraints under which many libraries are operating . In many instances the annual increments librarians receive no longer come close to matching increases in the cost of living , with the result that librarians subsidize the libraries and library users they serve . How long the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circumstances is a serious question . In addition , shrinking budgets and rising costs are forcing the purchase in many libraries of fewer and fewer books , periodicals , films and other media . Some years ago a sharp cut in the " book budget " was regarded as an emergency measure . These days it Is the norm . Should we continue to take our libraries and librarians for granted , the long-term result can he only a continuing decline in the quality and usefulness of these essential institutions ? despite the popularity they enjoy .
