Charles Marsh , Jr . I first posed for Norman Rockwell as a three-month-old baby being weighed by his proud parents . This was for an adver  --  tisement . I continued to pose for him un  --  til , when I was twelve , he moved from Arlington , Vermont to his present home in Stockbridge . The toughest time I had posing was when I was ten . I was supposed to kiss Mary Whalen in one of the scenes of A Day in the Life of a Girl . I considered her my girl friend then , but I had never built up enough courage to kiss her . Mr. Rock  --  well finally gave up on trying to get me to kiss her and posed us puckering separate  --  ly . Mary was a good model , and she was willing , but I could n't be persuaded . I have always told people who looked at that cover that that was my first kiss . Continued on page 81 Mary Whalen Leonard Norman Rockwell once called me his " favorite model .

My memories of modeling days with him when I was between ten and twelve are increasingly meaningful . The Norman Rockwell I know today ( we keep in touch ) is the same person I knew as a young girl , but now I better appreci  --  ate that he is a genius with a childlike heart , a man who leaves a lasting imprint on people as well as on canvas . My first recollection of him was at a high school basketball game in Arlington , Vermont , about 1950 . His son Tommy was on the local team , so along with near  --  ly everybody else in town , Norman was there to cheer the team on .

My father went to answer it , opened the door , and someone outside said , " I 'm Norman Rockwell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy and I suppose I was a reasonable choice . The first time that my brother Scott posed , Norman had a sketch of a bunch of boys arguing with the driver of a steam shovel who was about to dig up a sandlot which was their ball field . At that age ( three or four ) Scott hung around with one finger in his mouth and another up his nose ( he was a frustrated thumb-suck  --  er ) . Rockwell happened to see Scott strik  --  ing this attractive pose and stuck him in the picture .

I have never considered myself a celebrity , but I have received quite a bit of fan mail , made a television appearance with Rock  --  well ( the Hallmark Hall of Fame ) , auto  --  graphed pictures and books , and it has al  --  ways been a source of conversation . Peo  --  ple are fanatical about Rockwell and any  --  thing associated with him . Stockbridge was a small town in the mid-Fifties , and Rockwell was an active member of the community . My family knew Mr. Rockwell before I posed , so that was my " in .

This cover , Happy Birthday , Miss Jones , was a tribute to all schoolteachers , and to her in particular . First , he posed the children ; this was in a classroom of our local school . The birth  --  day remembrances  --  an apple , an orange , flowers , packages tied with string  --  were all there on top of the desk . Then the young ones were sent to another room , given their check and a bottle of Coca-Cola and encouraged to write on the blackboard what appeared in the painting . Continued on page 83 Ann Morgan Baker Mr. Rockwell was a very close friend of my parents . He was frequently at our house for dinner . He used to call my mother at 7 a.m. and say , " Do n't make the beds . I want to come and look at some messy rooms . " Then he would come and wander through our morning rubble and say to us ( we were all girls ) , " When I was a little girl , I always had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ posed for a Crest toothpaste ad , but when I showed up at the studio , I had two missing front teeth . Mr. Rockwell went ahead and painted my front teeth in for the ad , but my missing teeth may have given him the idea for a Post cover . Continued on page 84 Donald Campbell , M.D. The world knows Norman Rockwell as a great contemporary artist ; I know him as a kind , generous , thoughtful man who never fails to greet one on the street with a genuine smile and a hearty " Hello , how are things ? " He 's not too busy to take a shot at the weather , or the garden , or how those good natives are biting down on Muddy Brook , or on the Konkopot . And he thus endears himself to the townspeo  --  ple who regard him with respect and af  --  fection . Norman lived across the street from me for a number of years . It was a familiar sight to see his long legs carrying him down to the studio regularly before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rockwell every day when he is at home . I am his next-door neigh  --  bor . I know him really well . I used to have a taxi service and I drove him all over to take pictures and see people . He asked me to pose for the Expense Account cover in 1958 . It was a nice , easygoing session . Mr. Rockwell just kept talking and puffing on his pipe . My family thinks the cover turned out very nice . Most of my family has modeled for Mr. Rockwell at one time or another , but they were all for other projects  --  not Post covers . Mr. Rockwell is looked up to very much by the people of Stockbridge . I think people like his work so much be  --  cause he paints real life . He puts his all into pictures . He 's a very fine person . He is one of my best friends . I have known him a very long time . I run a garage in Stockbridge called Hall 's Auto Service . It 's on Main Street . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It also hangs in the Corner House here in Stockbridge . Being a model for Norman Rockwell has given me a sincere sense of pride . Peo  --  pre who might not have spoken to me oth  --  erwise have come up and told me they have seen copies of the cover . A copy now hangs in the State Police Academy in Framingham , Massachusetts . I also have a reproductidn of the original . I knew Norman Rockwell casually , as a fellow townsperson . For a short period of time we lived on the same street , two doors apart . Mr. Rockwell was aware that I was a state police officer . He called me and asked if I would pose for him . The Runaway happens to be my favor  --  ite Norman Rockwell painting .

I had not seen the Locke boy ( the young man in The Runaway ) from the time that we first posed ( 1958 ) until 1971 . He and I spent a semester studying logic at Berkshire Community College iu Pittsfield . You have given me  --  and countless others eat pleasure over these many decades .

He was on the set when we made a picture called Stagecoach , and he prevailed upon the director to give him a small part sit  --  ting in a saloon . He got a tremendous kick out of playing a tough guy in the old West . I had a great time when he did my portrait .

William Saroyan It is so right that Norman Rockwell 's sixtieth anniversary and the country 's Bi  --  centennial be celebrated together this year because Rockwell 's art is synonymous with America . Happy anniversary , Norman ! Art Linkletter Norman Rockwell has always had a way of staying in touch with the feelings and hearts of the American people . In this time of constant hunting by the news fra  --  ternity for the provocative , the thoughts and moods and illustrations of Norman are most welcome and refreshing .

Norman Rockwell 's great talent is that he somehow seems to put into his work the sense , the memories and the fun of our country in a way that historians and sociologists could never do . I have a special regard for him because many years ago , he painted a remarkably perceptive portrait of my grandfather , my father and me . I 'm pleased to have been one of the subjects of a real master of the American scene . Henry Ford II Norman Rockwell is , I think , the most thoroughly American artist of all .

Roy Rogers // Charles Marsh , Jr . continued from page 53 Now you know it was n't . A couple of my best friends when I was growing up in Arlington were Mary and her twin brother , Pete . They were also on covers and we often posed together . Many older persons in town also posed for him . Mr. Rockwell preferred the very old or the very young because they re  --  mained strictly them  --  selves when posing . Norman Rockwell was one of the reasons that a number of other interesting people came to Arlington ; settled , and became neighbors . A number of artists , who also did some cov  --  ers  --  Mead Scheaffer and John Atherton  --  were at  --  tracted to Arlington . Mr. Rockwell was a friendly , outgoing , pub  --  lic-spirited member of the community . The original painting , A Day in the Life of a Boy , he donated to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ street fair , and it was won for fifty cents . As I recall , he donated a painting every year to this group . I have the Post cover , A Day in the Life of a Boy , hung in my office . People comment on it once in a while . They wonder why I have it hanging there . When I tell them why , they sometimes doubt that it is me , because the boy in the painting has red hair . Mr. Rockwell consis  --  tently depicted me with red hair and freckles . I had lots of freckles , but I have blond hair . I now make a living in a commercial real estate company doing shop  --  ping center leasing , man  --  agement , development and land acquisition in Palo Alto , California . My wife is also from Ar  --  lington . We have two daughters , ages three and one-half and two and one-half . XI Mary Whalen Leonard continued from page 53 ed my Dad for a Coke , a friendly man sitting behind us gallantly reached over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his Coke . That was the beginning of my ad  --  miration for Norman Rockwell . A year or so after this informal encounter , Norman stopped by our house to ask three of us to pose : my mother , Margaret Whalen ; my broth  --  er Peter and me . Later I modeled by myself . Posing for Norman and other artists in town was part of living in our village . Even today many former Rockwell models are visible on Main Street ( Route 7 ) in Arlington . As a youngster I did n't spend time think  --  ing about being a cover girl . I was too busy living out the picture , A Day m the Life of a Girl ( painted in 1952 ) . Being with Norman was always an enjoyable experience , but of course there were moments of doubt : could I express what he wanted ? My par  --  ents did their part in making it easy for me . They never made any " big deal " out of the modeling sessions . Running into the studio I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and I greeted him with " Hi , Nor  --  man ! " He was the first adult whotold me I could call him by his first name , and that endeared him to me in a special way . He was my friend . I trusted him . And most of all I want  --  ed to please him . Usually Norman would set the scene by showing me a rough sketch and telling a story about it . He would embellish the story with marvelous exaggerations . Then in a flash he would turn to the work at hand . And it was serious . He knew what he wanted to happen and he set about making it happen . He would laugh and shout , pound the floor , or jump up and down . He did the acting while I reacted . He knew exactly what antic would evoke the emotional re  --  sponse he wanted . What a wonderful moment of joy when Norman drew forth from me the expressions he wanted . He would burst out laugh  --  ing , with happy shouts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moments which I treasure most . I can still hear deep within me his laugh of celebration . I am the child-becoming-woman in one of Norman Rockwell 's most popular illustrations , the picture of the Girl at the Mirror . I thought I knew at the time what that painting was about but in 1976 it tells me something more profound . In many ways this painting is so typical of Norman . Here is a hint of deep emo tion , a simple yet deli  --  cate presentation of de  --  tail , and underlying it all , a universal theme of pondering , wishing , and dreaming about becom  --  ing . This painting speaks to our hearts because all of us have such dreams . My favorite Rock  --  well painting is one in which I do not appear : his 1961 cover called Golden Rule . That pic  --  ture speaks to me of a love for people that is global in scope . Norman Rockwell has always been more than Amer  --  ican ; he reaches out be  --  yond boundaries of na  --  tions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Looking back , I feel very thankful for those childhood experiences . From Norman Rockwell I learned new dimen  --  sions of life and love which have contributed much to my adult living . The intervening years have been blessed with wonderful friendships and other good experi  --  ences . Most important has been my marriage to Philip Leonard , a mathe  --  matician , and the gift of three beautiful children : Andrew , seven ; Steph  --  anie , five ; and Margaret , two . Over the last sever  --  al years we have been fa  --  vored with two homes . We have split our living time between Tempe , Arizona , our real home , and Ottawa , Ontario , our second home . n Kenneth Ingram continued from page 54 ers . Ann Morgan lived next door . Eddie Locke was Scott 's closest friend . Doc Campbell was our family doctor . The whole town was full of celebrities . Rockwell is not Michelangelo or even Wyeth , but he is an " artist " who has captured many aspects of Americana in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remembered as one of the most important artists of the last fifty years . Evelyn Ingram continued from page 54 for his brother to get it over with ( as always , he was sucking his middle two fin  --  gers ) and Mr. Rockwell said , " Let 's put him in the picture too . " That was the start of my son Scott 's modeling career at age three , Ken modeled for Rock  --  well for a while , including the Post cover of the boy being fitted with glasses , but he left Stockbridge for New York City , where he would attend St. Thomas Choir School for three years . Mr. Rockwell had been a choir boy in New York , which gave him a cer  --  tain rapport with Ken . Ken and I are photographed to  --  gether in Rockwell 's stu  --  dio  --  Ken in his choirboy suit  --  as a kindness of Mr. Rockwell 's , and this photo  --  graph was presented to me . My son Scott appeared on the December 29 , 1956 cover of the boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawer . At the Corner House , a museum of Rock  --  well 's paintings , guides would point out that the mother of the model for that picture owned the gift shop at the Red Lion Inn . This was good for business , as they would come to my shop to see for themselves the woman who had that son preserved for posterity . When I felt some of them eyeing me , I often said , " You 've been to the Corner House . " Some people thought that I had an inside track and wanted to know how they could go about having Mr. Rockwell ask their kids to pose . I know one mother who paraded her child back and forth in front of his studio hoping that he would take notice . It be  --  came everyone 's ambition to become a Rockwell model and many in town were models , but no one knew his magic formula for the choice of a model . I wondered at times if seeing a particular person suggest  --  ed an idea to him . When our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covers , calendars and adver  --  tisements  --  the general cry would go out , " Not the In-grams again ! " Almost every Rockwell picture we were in , we had framed in knotty pine and hung in our kitchen . Many people have en  --  joyed the tour through our kitchen . If he wanted a person to wear a particular type of suit or any article of clothing when posing , he would buy the item and present it to that person . I remember he loaded us with Boy Scout uniforms and acces  --  sories after we posed for their annual picture . He also gave us many of the photographs he used to record the poses and sometimes preliminary sketches and some extremely for  --  tunate people were even given charcoal renderings , watercolor sketches , and a lucky few received the actual finished oil painting . Mr. Rockwell has helped to make our town very special . Hav  --  ing my shop gave me the opportunity to meet so many people that came to Stockbridge to catch a glimpse of him at noontimes when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Main Street for exercise . It was hard for people to understand that they could n't go to his studio and have a short visit not realizing the line would extend from here to there every day and that he consequently would n't have time to paint . Fortunately we have the Corner House which exhibits his paintings and people can go there . As many as 500 people go through the Corner House each day during the summer and fall , to look , buy prints , litho  --  graphs , and plates . It is my impression that this is a love affair going on now and going back many years , with people loving him for giving them so much pleasure . He depicted life in America as it revolved around everyday peo  --  ple . When Molly married Norman Rockwell , she was sixty-five years old and it was her first mar  --  riage . Some of us shop  --  ping in the local grocery store were giving her our best wishes and she said , " Was n't he worth wait  --  ing sixty-five years for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scott Ingram continued from page 54 well just because I did pose for him so marry times . Sinee I was so young when I was posing , I seldom understood thebasic ideas of his covers , but it did n't matter because I always looked for  --  ward to his treat of a milk shake at the end of each session , not to men  --  tion the modeling fee , which , by the way , I never saw . I do not consider Rockwell to be a great artist as much as an illustra  --  tor  --  there 's quite a difference . I enjoy his work , especially the hu  --  morous subtleties in many of his pic  --  tures . I would n't say that Rockwell 's work is the kind I most prefer , but it has a special meaning for me . Living in Stockbridge is so differ  --  ent from living anywhere else . I nev  --  er tell any tourists where Rockwell lives , because they have been known to barge into his house , pick his flow  --  ers , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for putting Stockbridge on the map , along with Alice Brock of Alice 's Restaurant fame . People see an idealistic America in Rockwell 's paintings . He stresses simplicity and does n't keep you guessing as to the " hidden meaning " behind his work . I think that people in general like to be entertained , and Rockwell is extremely entertaining . You do n't have to know surrealistic art , cubism , etc . You just look and enjoy . He 's very easy . Today I am vice-president of Chisolm Classics in Boulder , Colora do , a mail-order company that Ilan-dies leather products . I do have one of my covers hanging in my office and many people notice it and talk about it . It has never been embarrass  --  ing for me , except for an occasional " But baby , look at you nowl " n Anne Braman continued from page 55 Then Mr. Rockwell posed me against the blackboard . His late wife , Mary , was present and did not care for the shoes I was wearing at the time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least two sizes too large for me . The cover gave me a number of interesting contacts with people who were rather amused at meeting and talking with me . I learned of my " double " in Union City , Indiana , who the local reporters there were certain was the model for the paint  --  ing . She was a teacher . When I attended my twenty-fifth high school reunion in Connecticut , I was given a prize for being the first member of the class to be a " cov  --  er girl . " But my favorite cov  --  er is Marriage License , for a very special reason . Early in January 1955 , my mother-in-law died . Mr. Rockwell , knowing my father-in-law , Jason C. Braman , realized how upset he was and he thought if he could get him to model it would give him something new to think about . Mr. Rockwell indicated he had done this sort of thing in the past when someone had lost a loved one . My father-in-law was never a town clerk , as he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the department store in town for over thirty-two years . Over the years , he had made acquaintances with many customers and salesmen . As soon as the Marriage License painting appeared on the cover of the Post , people immediately recognized him ; it was an exact likeness . His name appeared with the description of the cover and he heard from peo  --  ple all over the country with the same last name . When his friends com  --  mented to him about the cover , he would say , " Would you like for me to autograph your copy ? " And he would . When I told Mr. Rock  --  well about this , he was quite amused . At the time that issue came out , I asked Norman 's permis  --  sion to arrange a display in our store  --  front window using Dad 's coat , hat , umbrella , geranium and numerous Rockwell sketches , and copies of his first book , Norman Rockwell , illus  --  trator . Mr. Rockwell 's studio was then on Main Street over the grocery store near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ request to put up the display was , " Well , I guess I 'll have to stay off the street for a week . " Al - ways modest  --  the true Norman Rockwell . Many people are attracted to Stockbridge with the hope of catch  --  ing a glimpse of Norman Rockwell , and they often did when his studio was on Main Street . I can recall a time when he owned a basset who was always getting away , and he was always retrieving the dog . Over the years , numerous local children had the honor of being dog walkers for the Rock wells . I love Mr. Rockwell 's work be  --  cause it is so down to earth , a real way of life , much of it so characteris  --  tic of New England . The minute de  --  tails he portrays are just incredible . A great many children and adults have had the privilege of posing for Mr. Rockwell over the years here in Stockbridge . For years , I have made the floral decorations for the interior of the Red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have acquired the title of " Flower Lady . " n Ann Morgan Baker continued from page 55 Being on the cover changed my life in one sense of the word . People were always saying , " I saw you in Chicago , " or " I saw you in a drug  --  store window in New York . " I thought of myself as a tiny little international star in those days . And $25 when you 're six is a lot of money . I remember a couple of amusing moments during sittings . One Sun  --  day morning after Sunday school , we were modeling for a Thanksgiving picture with a delicious roast turkey . I must have been particularly fidgety that day . It seemed the only way to keep me still was to feed me cold turkey . So all morning I nibbled , sit  --  ting in my chair . Another time , Scott Ingram and I were posing with our dog , a beagle with one black eye and one white eye named Figaro . The picture in  --  cluded a local veterinarian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep him still . Well , it had been too much for him . We had to hold him up all the way through the posing . He was so doped up that he could n't support himself at all . I have a lot of favorite Post cov  --  ers . I suppose the one I like best is the little boy discovering the Santa Claus costume in the drawer . Scott Ingram was the model for that . He was my first real love , so maybe that is why I 've always liked it . I am married now and I am get  --  ting used to being a new mother . Andrew was born July 31,1975 . My husband Ralphe is head of the de  --  signer 's salon at Saks Fifth Avenue in Atlanta . We are both very happy . I have taught school for the last few years . The children in my classes were always amused to know I had been a Rockwell model . One day , a little girl came up to me and told me she had bought a wastebasket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pliment . Our neighborhood newspaper did an article about my early modeling career with a " before and after " pic  --  ture .

Occasionally he would ride his bike , but ordinarily he would walk . Norman could n't help being nice to people , especially children . When my five-year-old Betsy fell from her bike because a little dog followed her , barking , Norman gathered her up , stopped her tears and took her home with him . With Betsy on his knee , he drew a series of pictures as in a cartoon , showing a little dog chasing a little child on a bike . The last picture showed the little girl 's face with the caption , " See . The nice little dog only wanted to play . " My relationship with Norman is also a doctor-patient relationship . When posing At the Doctor 's , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy 's pants should be . I am still an active family doctor . No more children are home  --  it 's quiet now . I miss their chatter and noise . But I now have seven grand  --  children . I encountered my seventieth birthday February 16 . I do n't feel much different  --  and I get a free hunting and fishing license this year .
