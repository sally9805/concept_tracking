Of all the diseases that plague man , one of the most resilient is malaria . As recently as a dozen years ago , health authorities believed they had the disease on the run in South Asia , where throughout history it had taken its greatest toll . Now the World Health Organization admits that its victory bulletins were premature . Malaria has returned to the region-with a vengeance . The total number of victims in South Asia this year is expected to reach 20 million . <P> All of Asia 's southern tier , from Afghanistan to Indonesia , is affected by the outbreak . But malaria has struck hardest at the Indian subcontinent . India , which cut malaria cases from a 1947 high of 75 million to only 125,000 by 1965 , expects to record 4 million this year . Pakistan , which then included Bangladesh , had reduced its annual toll from tens of millions to only 9,500 in 1961 , estimates 10 million cases in 1975 . Sri Lanka ( formerly Ceylon ) , which once had 2.5 million cases per year , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1975 , however , it has recorded at least 500,000 cases . <P> The reasons for the resurgence of malaria are complex . Throughout the ' 50s and early ' 60s , the governments of South Asia armed themselves with the newly developed miracle weapon DDT , and waged all-out war on the mosquitoes that carry malaria , spraying ponds , swamps and other breeding areas , and even sending health teams into homes to track down the insects . For a while , the campaign to combat malaria was spectacularly successful . " If you just wrote DDT on the wall , mosquitoes used to die , " says Dr. M.I.D . Sharma , commissioner of India 's rural health services . The disease that once made vast stretches of the Himalayan foothills practically uninhabitable almost disappeared from many communities . Formerly infested areas were opened to development , and governments began to phase out the spraying programs , diverting resources to seemingly more pressing health problems . " We became complacent , " acknowledges Indian Health Minister Karan Singh . " We thought we had it licked . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mosquitoes to thrive and multiply again . Quinine , used to treat malaria , is in short supply in some areas ; India has not encouraged cultivation of the Cinchona trees from whose bark the drug is obtained ( the malaria parasite is showing a rising resistance to the drug chloroquine , a synthetic substitute for quinine ) . Furthermore , rising petroleum prices have sent the costs of insecticides soaring , placing another burden on the shaky economics of the region . DDT , which cost India about $500 per ton in 1974 , now costs $1,500 . <P> Modest Goal . The governments of South Asia have responded with a host of emergency programs . Pakistani officials are importing $35 million worth of insecticides and spraying equipment from the U.S. Authorities in Sri Lanka are trying to crack down on illegal gem miners , who contribute to the malaria problem by digging pits which then fill with water in which mosquitoes breed . <P> None of the afflicted countries expect to eradicate the disease ; it is just too well entrenched to be defeated by current control methods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says India 's Singh . His modest goal : to bring the malaria incidence in his country down to 500 per million , or about 300,000 cases , by 1984.
