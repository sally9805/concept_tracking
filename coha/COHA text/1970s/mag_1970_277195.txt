THE separatist cause espoused by the Quebec Liberation Front is nothing new either to the province or Canada . <P> The idea of an independent , French-dominated Quebec goes back to 1759 , when the British defeated the French on the Plains of Abraham and made Canada a part of the empire . Over the next 200 years , the separatist notion reappeared periodically but never really became a movement . <P> In the 1960s , however , the idea began to take firm hold . Part of this was due to Charles de Gaulle 's fiery brand of French nationalism , which he recommended to Quebeckers during a memorable visit in 1967 . Partly it was due to nationalistic and ethnic stirrings being felt round the world . <P> Early in the 1960s , Quebec 's Premier Jean Lesage vowed to make Quebeckers the matres chez nous ( masters in our own house ) within the Federation . By 1968 , Ren Lvesque , once a member of Lesage 's Cabinet , helped found the Parti Qubecois , which demanded political separation from Canada . Last spring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in provincial elections . <P> Lvesque and his colleagues are moderates committed to electoral democracy . At the same time that his ideas were gaining prominence a different breed of separatist was developing : disaffected radicals committed to violent action . In 1962 , these activists created the Front de Libration du Qubec . They systematically began planting bombs in mailboxes , robbing banks , setting fire to government buildings . Kidnaping is their latest weapon . " There is no difference between the F.L.Q. and the liberation movement of Palestine , of Viet Nam , of Black Power , " says F.L.Q. Leader Charles Gagnon . <P> Moderate and radical separatists share one goal for Quebec : total political separation from Canada . They complain that in predominantly English-speaking Canada ( 16,000,000 , to 6,000,000 French Canadians ) they are no more than second-class citizens . Too much wealth , Quebeckers complain , is concentrated in English-controlled Ontario , where roughly one-third of Canada 's manufacturing industries are situated . There is doubt , however , that Quebec could develop its bountiful natural resources quickly enough to go it alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a recent terrorist manifesto put it , " We have had our fill of promises of jobs and prosperity while we always remain the cowering servants and bootlickers of the big shots . " The moderates might agree with the sentiment , but their similarity to the terrorists ends at that point . The ballot box may be discouragingly slow , but at least it is not stained with blood .
