" Just like the old days , " muttered a grizzled Zulu elder in Johannesburg 's Soweto . Standing in a dusty street one day last week , he recalled with a mixture of admiration and apprehension the legendary days of the 19th century wars against the whites by South Africa 's largest and fiercest tribe ( see box below ) . This time , however , the target of the angry Zulus in Soweto was the black militants-the student leaders and other activists who were leading a three-day boycott to prevent Soweto 's 250,000-member black labor force from going to work in Johannesburg , 15 miles away . <P> For two days and nights last week , Zulu impis ( war parties ) , armed with spears , sticks , knives and knobkerries , the traditional Zulu clubs , were on the warpath once again , turning Soweto ( pop . 1 million ) into a city of terror . Forming an extended battle line in the manner of the Zulu warriors of old , they surged through the township chanting " Bulala ! Bulala ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , particularly the young , attempted to flee . Many camped out in front of police stations seeking protection against the marauding Zulus . An African priest described how a 16-year-old schoolboy was chased into his church by a band of Zulus who dragged the boy from the priest 's arms and clubbed him to death . Before the fighting was over , 35 had been killed and perhaps 200 injured by mob violence and police gunfire . <P> It all started early in the week when Soweto 's young militants , in an effort to sustain the black demonstrations against racial discrimination , called on all Soweto workers to stay home from their jobs in Johannesburg for three days . With leaflets , with placards , with shouted threats , they warned everyone to support the strike or pay the consequences . " Give our regards to your white masters , " one worker on his way to Johannesburg was told . " We 'll be waiting for you tonight . " On the first day , about 40% of Soweto 's work force stayed home . <P> But striking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running at 20% . Conspicuous among the Soweto residents who refused to strike were the migrant males , many of them Zulu tribesmen , who live in dormitory-like hostels and send most of their earnings to their families in the tribal homelands far away . The migrants were little impressed by either the young activists ' efforts to organize political demonstrations or the government 's recent concessions to black militancy , like the decision to allow Soweto residents to purchase outright more than half of the township 's houses ( for about $1,500 apiece ) . They were there simply to work and be left alone . When the activists began to threaten them for refusing to strike , threw a couple of Zulu workers off a train and actually set fire to one of the Zulu hostels , the migrant workers erupted in fury-and Soweto 's " Zulu war " was on .
