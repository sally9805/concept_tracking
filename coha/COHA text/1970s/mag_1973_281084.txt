" All I can say is that women , when they are in power , are much harsher than men ... You 're schemers , you 're evil . Every one of you . " The misogynist ? Iran 's Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi , 54 , in an interview with idol-smashing Italian Journalist Oriana Fallaci published in the New Republic . Fallaci , whose belt already holds the scalps of Henry Kissinger , Willy Brandt and Nguyen Van Thieu , scored again with the revelation that the Shah is not , after all , a ladies ' man . What prompted His Sublime Highness 's anger , however , was something quite simple . Fallaci had asked him if it were true that he had reverted to harem , taking another wife in addition to his third official one , Empress Farah , 35 . Said the Shah : " A stupid , vile , disgusting libel . " <P> The plot of the 1952 play was distinctly threadbare : seven candidates for the Distressed Gentlefolk 's Aid Association trapped by a blizzard in a provincial guesthouse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said optimistically , " I do think we will get quite a good run out of it , " as she signed over all royalties to her grandson Mathew Prichard , 9 . Twenty-one years later , The Mousetrap has become the longest running play ever , totting up 8,717 performances in London and earning $7.5 million . Prichard , now 30 and a gentleman farmer in Wales , declined to comment on the extent of his fortune , and gallantly accompanied his benefactor Dame Agatha , 83 , to a party celebrating the historic anniversary . <P> The U.S. Board of Parole took positive action in the case of Clifford Irving , who is serving a 2-year sentence for dreaming up an " autobiography " of Howard Hughes and selling it to McGraw-Hill for $765,000 . Irving had hoped to spend Christmas with his sons , Nedsky , 5 , and Barnaby , 3 , especially since their mother Edith is sequestered in a Swiss jail for her part in the hoax . Instead Irving will be sprung on Feb. 14 , 1974 . It seemed almost as heavyhanded as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have chosen April 1 . <P> " London always meant the most to me , " exulted a magnanimous Maria Callas , 50 , after she had ignited the Royal Festival Hall 's S.R.O . audience . Ending an eight-year absence from the London stage , Callas shared a program of four duets and three solos each with Tenor Giuseppe di Stefano , 52 . Three thousand ticket holders , who had spent an uneasy month of suspense after Callas canceled a previous concert , responded ecstatically . They gave the diva a 30-minute standing ovation , pelted the stage with flowers and finally mobbed her limousine . Exhilarated , Callas declared : " I can go on from here . I thought at one time I would never beat my nerves , but I have . " However , that was before the critics had their say . Unanimous in mourning the passing of a great voice , they described her performance as " thin , hesitant " and her top register as weak , even squally . The man from the Financial Times summed it up : " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carmen had been a record played on an old-fashioned gramophone . "
