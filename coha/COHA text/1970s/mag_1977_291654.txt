There are three hazards to living in North Dakota , the residents there are fond of saying : blizzards , mosquitoes and Robert McCarney . A millionaire Ford auto dealer , McCarney , 65 , is the all-time champion referendum holder in the state . He has forced so many laws to be tested at the polls that he has been referred to as " the fourth branch of state government . " His current crusade is to stop North Dakota from spending some $18.5 million for new buildings . Boasts he : " Any benefit to the people of this state has come through my efforts , not the legislature 's . " <P> McCarney hitchhiked from Churdan , Iowa , to Bismarck in 1932 with 50 in his pocket and stayed to make his fortune selling cars , but the referendum is his game and he has been playing it with skill and delight since 1963 . He failed that year to persuade the Republican state legislature not to increase income taxes . Then he discovered a swift way to block the legislation : gather 7,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collected the petitions , had his referendum , and nixed the tax increase by a margin of 6 to 1 . <P> Success followed success . In 1965 a McCarney referendum canceled another tax package , 4 to 1 . In 1969 McCarney defeated plans for a $3.2 million state office building . Last year he scored three times when voters cut the state sales tax from 4% to 3% , ended it on electricity and halved it on farm equipment . In all , the initiatives and referendums cranked out by the crusty and imposing crusader ( 6 ft. 2 in. , 218 lbs. ) have saved the state 's taxpayers some $200 million , according to his calculations . <P> Running Rabbit . Ironically , McCarney himself can not win public office . A maverick Republican , he has triumphed in primaries only to lose one election after another from 1964 until 1974-although in 1970 he came within 528 votes of winning a seat in Congress . <P> What drives McCarney to organize his referendums ? Partly his own irrepressibility . " I 'm like a rabbit in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No one knows which way I 'm going to run next . " But he claims he does it mainly because someone has to stand up for what 's right-and he 's spent $250,000 of his own funds in the process . " If you keep your money and the government needs it , " he says , " the government can always get it . But if the government has your money and you need it , then you ca n't get it . " <P> Many legislators argue that McCarney 's referendums have cut back progressive programs , like state-supported kindergartens , but McCarney remains unshaken . People , he says , " ca n't afford to pay more taxes . If something is n't done , it 's going to destroy the home , and eventually it 's going to destroy America . "
