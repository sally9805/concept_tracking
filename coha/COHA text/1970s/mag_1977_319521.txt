At the London summit , President Carter will try his hand at dealing with persistent ailments that are afflicting the world 's economy : inflation , unemployment and destructive trade imbalances . To a great extent , the assembled leaders will be waiting to see how Carter proposes answers to this complex of pressing problems . <P> At the core of the meeting will be the grim fact that with the exception of the U.S. and Japan , the world economy is showing virtually no sign of improvement and is not expected to this year . The Economic Commission for Europe , a Geneva-based U.N . organization , predicts that Western Europe 's output of goods and services , discounted for inflation , will increase only 3% through December , not enough to stem rising unemployment . Trade will grow at only half of 1976 's 11% rate , says the commission , and the rise in consumer prices will back off only slightly , from 10.5% last year to 9% . <P> Carter will enter the discussion on how to stimulate the world economy with one big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan to stimulate the U.S. economy by giving $50 rebates to taxpayers . Carter thus will be in no position to repeat his earlier requests that Germany and Japan stimulate their economies and thereby increase imports from Britain , France and Italy , which badly need to sell more abroad to help their own recoveries . Japan and Germany are reluctant to adopt any major stimulus program for much the same inflationary worries that led Carter to withdraw the rebate . Some experts are relieved that " reflation " will not be made an issue by Carter , at least formally . Says one White House planner : " Pushing them Japan and Germany is probably the wrong tactical move . " <P> That still leaves much to talk about . Protectionist sentiment is on the rise in the U.S. and Europe , though Carter 's refusal in March to impose higher tariffs on shoe imports is seen as an effective countering force , at least in spirit . Indeed the Europeans and the Japanese are by and large encouraged by what they have seen of Carter so far . Says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approach that is very impressive . " The President hopes to revive the bogged-down Tokyo Round of tariff-cutting trade negotiations begun two years ago in Geneva . Says one White House official : " All it takes is the necessary resolution by the top guys , and they will all be in London . " <P> The London agenda will also include the distressing problems of the Third World . Last year the balance of payments deficits of the developing nations that do not produce oil amounted to more than $25 billion . The wildly fluctuating revenues the nations receive from selling commodities on the world market are often not enough to cover their oil bills . One proposed solution : the creation of a " common fund " of $3 billion to stabilize prices by buying up excess crops and minerals that drive down prices . Carter is willing to seriously consider such an idea , as are the Europeans , but only after agreements are hammered out in advance on how to stabilize the price of each commodity . In contrast , the developing countries want the fund set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be just one of the problems that Jimmy Carter and his peers will struggle with at the summit .
