In recent years the task of educating New Yorkers in the history and subtleties of Eastern art has mainly been shouldered by two institutions : the Japan Society , founded in 1907 , and the Asia Society , both of which have an impeccable track record of succinct , informative exhibitions . The concerns have a trustee in common : John D. Rockefeller III , 67 , who became a collector of Oriental art after a trip to Japan with John Foster Dulles in 1951 and in 1956 founded the Asia Society . Last week it was announced that Rockefeller , in stepping down from the society 's chairmanship , had given it his collection and promised to foot the bill for housing it in a new and larger Asia House in Manhattan . Says Rockefeller , " there is a particularly useful role for the small , specialized museum of high quality . " Eventually , it is hoped , the expanded Asia House , with its nucleus of Rockefeller objects , will become an Oriental equivalent to New York 's small , specialized Frick Collection of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prints . <P> The collection is small-300 items - but discriminating . It is especially strong in Nepalese bronzes , sculpture from India and Southeast Asia , and ceramics and lacquer from Japan , Korea and China . The rationale behind the collection , explains Dr. Sherman Lee , director of the Cleveland Museum of Art , who frequently advised Rockefeller on what to buy , " is one that insists on the highest possible quality in the objects acquired and on their capacity to be understood and enjoyed by the interested layman . " Included in the gift are some of the most striking South Indian bronzes and stone carvings of the 8th to 11th centuries left in private hands , such as a 10th-llth century figure of Krishna dancing on the hood of the cobra-demon Kaliya , holding up the creature 's tail in a ripple of bronze like a Malay kris , and the majestic , decapitated Female Torso from llth century Cambodia , an image as silent and epigrammatic as any archaic Greek kouros.               @ @ @ @ @ @
