<P> As practiced by well-informed West Germans , it has become something of a national indoor sport . The game : coalition politics , or trying to outguess your friends on the composition of the next government in Bonn . Any number can play , and currently many are doing so . The reason : Chancellor Helmut Schmidt 's coalition of Social Democrats and Free Democrats is in such trouble , largely on economic issues , that some observers fear it may not survive until the next scheduled federal election in November 1976 . Last week Bonn was buzzing with rumors that the Free Democrats , who have suffered a string of losses in local elections and are annoyed at Schmidt 's increasingly highhanded way of dealing with them , might soon pull out of the coalition . <P> The chief beneficiary of a Free Democratic defection would be the opposition alliance of the Christian Democratic Union and its Bavarian affiliate , the Christian Social Union , who together have 234 seats in the Bundestag . Schmidt 's S.D.P. has 242 seats and the Free Democrats have 42 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a new coalition . If they refused , the result could be dissolution of the Bundestag and a call for an early national election the Christian Democrats might well win . The latest polls indicate that they would probably get 53% of the popular vote , compared with 38% for the S.D.P. and 7% for the Free Democrats . <P> Who would dominate a Christian Democratic return to power ? The answer is none other than Franz Josef Strauss , 59 , the ham-fisted Bavarian political boss who has once again made a phoenix-like return from the political grave . From his base as leader of the C.S.U. , Strauss has emerged after several years of political eclipse to become one of the most important power brokers in Bonn . <P> Strauss 's comeback began last October when the C.S.U. , under his leadership , captured 62% of the vote in the Bavarian state elections , giving it the largest majority enjoyed by any party in any German state assembly . Since then , to demonstrate that he can draw crowds outside his rural , conservative and Roman Catholic bailiwick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Schleswig-Holstein and even the working-class , traditionally left-leaning Ruhr . This week Strauss flies off to Peking-at the invitation of the Chinese-to re-establish his credentials in foreign affairs . <P> Strauss has no need to establish credentials in domestic matters . Since 1949 he has represented Weilheim in the Bundestag and held important Cabinet posts in previous governments , including Defense and Finance . A champion of law-and-order , an advocate of a militarily strong Germany , and an uncompromising antiCommunist , he became the symbol of cold war intransigence.
