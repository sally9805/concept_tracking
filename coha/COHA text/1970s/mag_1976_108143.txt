King County Stadium , alias the Kingdome , hosted its very first sports event last Friday night and it was an occasion for Seattle to savor . They sold $1.25 burritos ( meat pies ) , $1.50 " Orleans hot links " ( with corn pone ) and $1.50 Kingdogs . They also sold a preseason North American Soccer League match between the New York Cosmos , starring Pel ? , and the Seattle Sounders , featuring a bunch of Britishers , to 58,128 fans , the biggest crowd ever to see a soccer game in the U.S. // The crowd might have been larger still except for three things : the SuperSonics were playing the NBA champion Golden State Warriors two miles away at the Coliseum before a packed house of 14,096 ; the Sonics game was also on home television ; and no more people could have been squeezed into the Kingdome anyway because approximately 5,000 seats had not yet been installed . Local spirits were not particularly dampened when Pel ?  --  who else ?  --  scored the first goal or even when New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ domed stadium , the appeal of being on hand for its first sporting event and the promise of seeing Pel ? did nothing to hurt the gate , of course , but the fact is that Seattle right now is insatiably hungry for pro sports . The Sonics , who have clinched a spot in the playoffs , regularly sell out the Coliseum and the Kingdome will be the setting for a few playoff games . The new NFL Seahawks , who start operations this fall , sold an incredible 59,000 season tickets in two weeks . And major league baseball returns next year . // The Sounders , beginning their third season in the 10-year-old NASL , have done an excellent job of promotion . They used to play home games in little Memorial Stadium near the Space Needle and sold all 17,925 seats for the final four games last year . Their offensive star is Geoff Hurst , who 10 years ago scored three goals in England 's World Cup victory over West Germany . The defensive ace is Mike England , who is Welsh . At the moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English League 's second division and has not yet joined his U.S. team . // The Cosmos have been showing off their magical Pel ? all over the country  --  San Diego , San Antonio , Phoenix , etc.  --  happily supplying him with jerseys to give away . It seems that once he was almost strangled when a fan tried to rip off his jersey , so he started taking them off right after matches and parting with them voluntarily . He has given away about 140 since joining New York last season . // The Cosmos played in Honolulu Wednesday night , beating Honda of Japan 5-0 , and Pel ? put on one of his marvelous shows , scoring four goals , three of them in a 15-minute span in the second half . He said it was the 31st time in his career that he had scored four goals in a match . One of the Honolulu goals he called his best ever , which would mean better than any of the other 1,200 or so . // From the left of the goal , blocked off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constantly ) , he kicked the ball over their heads with his heel , ran around them and stopped the ball with his chest . Then , from a difficult angle , he booted it past the goalie into the net . // There are 10 other men who take the pitch with Pel ? , of course , and some of them are very good . The top newcomer is David Clements , captain of Northern Ireland 's team . The Cosmos also have two of Pel ? ' s teammates from Santos of Brazil , young Midfielder Nelsi Morais and Peruvian Midfielder Ramon Mifflin . American Bob Rigby , who played college soccer at East Stroudsburg State , has developed into one of the league 's better goalies. // The Sounders were obviously hurt on defense by the absence of England and the newness of their young Canadian goalie , Tony Chursky , but on Friday night their offense was n't exactly purring , either . One trouble was that Hurst and a few others only arrived in Seattle the previous weekend and the team was not cohesive yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ball to each other instead of to open spaces and letting their mates run to the ball . // New York scored two quick goals , one by Pel ? on a free kick and one by Clements that glanced off the left post and into the net , and that was enough to win . Seattle closed the gap to 2-1 on a header by Assistant Coach Jim Gabriel , but Pel ? scored on another free kick with less than four minutes to go to ice the match . // As brilliant and exuberant as Pel ? was , the star of the evening was the stadium itself . The Kingdome is an unadorned gray hulk squatting just a few blocks south of America 's original " skid road , " Yesler Way , and the Pioneer Square historical district . The building cost $66.2 million , which figures out to $1,018 per seat , half what it cost to put a seat in the Superdome in New Orleans . Kingdome not only does n't have a coat of paint on its exterior but also very few frills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scoreboard , no private boxes furnished like a seraglio. // The seats may be hard , but very few of them afford a bad view . The Telescreen may be dim , but at least it does n't spoil anyone 's view of the field as the screens at the Superdome do . And there are folks in Seattle who are happy with the Kingdome 's drab concrete and brutalist-style architecture . A lively local weekly called , originally enough , The Weekly , seemed quite fond already of the stadium 's unromantic ramps and ventilator shafts . " The Kingdome is a blood-and-guts sports arena , pure and simple , " said the paper , " a fitting addition to a city built by longshoremen and lumberjacks. " // There were surprisingly few snafus for an opening night , perhaps because the Kingdome had already been through a gala entertainment opening a couple of weeks earlier . The burritos were hot if a bit too doughy . People who found that the seats they had bought had not yet been installed were quickly put into comparable seats that the Sounders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chunks of reinforced concrete plummeted to the plastic sod . The politicians kept their speeches short . And the expected traffic jam outside never developed , although crowds of people were still waiting at nearby bus stops long after the match was over . // One minor disappointment was that Pel ? left the pitch with his green Cosmos shirt still on his back and apparently did n't give it to anyone . The Sounders ' management decided next day to send for it so that it can be enshrined in the sports museum that will soon be installed on the Kingdome 's second level . One hopes that it will remain unwashed , to suit a brutalist blood-and-guts arena .
