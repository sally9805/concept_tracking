His detractors , notably U.S. military brass , have called him dishonest , dangerous , anti-American and even a card-carrying Communist . But admiring junior officers asked for his autograph , and Congressmen visiting Viet Nam sought him out to obtain his views on the war . Associated Press Correspondent Peter Arnett , in fact , is one of the most energetic and resourceful reporters ever to cover Indochina . <P> Something of a legend among rival newsmen for being in the right place at the right time , Arnett combines hustle with a discerning eye for detail and an acute ear for devastating quotes , including those that symbolize the tragedy of the war . He was there , for example , when an Army major looked over the ruins of Ben Tre after the Tet offensive and said , " The city had to be destroyed in order to save it . " <P> Last week , after eight years of duty in Indochina , Arnett left at his own request for reassignment as a roving reporter in the U.S. Departing A.P . ' s Saigon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Photographer-Reporter Horst Faas . Most recently in charge of the bureau 's much-admired photo operations , Faas will become a roving Southeast Asia correspondent based in Singapore . <P> Aggressive Team . New Zealand-born Arnett , now 35 , and German-born Faas , now 37 , arrived in Viet Nam for A.P . on the same day in 1962 . Often they worked as a reporting team . On the surface , they may seem too alike for compatibility . Arnett is brash , aggressive ; Faas is gruff , Prussianly efficient . But together they produced some spectacular results . Among them : the 1965 disclosure that U.S. and South Vietnamese forces were experimenting with non-lethal gas ; last year 's exclusive on Alpha Company , the U.S. Army unit that balked at an order to advance . Individually , they did equally well . Arnett won a Pulitzer Prize for international reporting in 1965 ; Faas won a Pulitzer for his photography in 1964 . <P> One of Arnett 's most memorable items was his account of the battle in 1967 for Hill 875 , near Dak To . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he recalls , 97 were killed and 120 were wounded . " We were stuck there for 30 hours , no water , no nothing-just enemy fire . The living and the dead had the same gray pallor . When I finally got on the helicopter to get out of there , I just bawled , I was so glad to be alive . " The same year Faas wrote a moving story while he was in a hospital recovering from a severe rocket wound . Without his camera , Faas simply recorded in words the scene around him : the boy without a face , the stains on the nurses ' clothes , the moans , the man who quietly quivered and died during the evening television news . <P> Such stories helped make the two newsmen , Arnett in particular , the target of Pentagon ire . But both insist they have been more than fair . " Our mistake , " says Arnett , " was in not being pessimistic enough . " One military complaint was that he avoided talking to generals . Says Arnett : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ events . I 'd rather make my own . I do n't want Abrams whispering to me about the goddam Thais and telling me I ca n't quote him . That restricts my reportage.
