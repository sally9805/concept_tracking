CARLOS CASTANEDA IS DRIVING his tan Volks- wagen bus along a boulevard that takes us through the greater Los Angeles area and ocean-ward . " I was having car trouble , " he says . " Don Juan told me to talk to my car and make it an extension of myself . I said , ' Come on , don Juan . it 's just a machine ! That would be insane . ' He said , ' The car operates from power and under power . It is the power you must talk to . ' I did , and my car is now a warrior 's car . It 's just a stupid Volkswagen , like anybody else 's , but if I run out of gas , it 's in front of a gas station . " He beams . " It 's a matter of talking to power . " CASTANEDA WENT TO ARIZONA in 1960 to study the uses of medicinal plants among the Yaqui Indians . He was about to begin graduate work in anthropology at UCLA and he wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In Arizona he came to know an Indian . don Juan Matus , who had a reputation as an herbalist . Don Juan eventually said that certain omens had revealed that Castaneda should become his apprentice . " I asked myself : ' What could a greasy old Indian possibly teach me , a man of science ? ' " Castaneda says in a self-mocking tone . But he goes on to explain that he did not want to pass up an offer that alight lead to more scholarly papers . Under don Juan 's tutelage he experimented with psychotropic plants . Don Juan repeatedly emphasized that these plants were to endow the user with power , and with the means for entering another order of reality . Castaneda was also made to carry out baffling and exacting rituals . All the while , don Juan patiently elucidated a highly detailed system of knowledge with foundations so alien that Castaneda could scarcely take them seriously . In turn , however , don Juan considered Castaneda 's gathering of data for people back at the university a contemptible activity . Can an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made of the deadly jimson weed to his body , Castaneda apparently bounded into the air and soared over the mountains and through the clouds . Eventually he tumbled into blackness . " Did I fly ? " lie asked don Juan later . " Did my body fly like a bird ? " Don Juan , who could at times assume the persona of a crow , replied that Castaneda flew like a man who has taken the devil 's weed . Castaneda pressed on , not satisfied with the reply : " Let 's put it another way , don Juan . . . f I had tied myself to a rock with a heavy chain I would have flown just the same , because my body had nothing to do with coy flying . " Don Juan looked at me incredulously . " If you tie yourself to a rock , " he said , " I am afraid you will have to fly holding the rock with its heavy chain . " Castaneda began entering another continuum of reality even when he had not used psycho-tropics . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he became terrified of losing the chains that bound him to that hypothetical rock . So he withdrew from the apprenticeship and organized his extensive field notes into a master 's thesis , The Teachings of Don Juan : A Yaqui Way of Knowledge . This was the first of his three books , and an underground best seller. * I. his great annoyance , Castaneda has been pursued ever since by people who think he 's one of the illuminati . One ardent would-be disciple dogged his reluctant guru night and day until Castaneda was driven to hurl him over a park bench . " The only way to deal with a psychotic is to be one yourself . " Castaneda remarks dryly . ) Castaneda dedicated the book to don Juan and took it to him in Mexico . The Indian admired the cover and said , with a characteristically sardonic affection , that he 'd better not keep it *university of California Press , $6.95. because " you know what we do with paper in Mexico , " In spite of Castaneda 's fears and suspicions , don @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imposing to neglect ; besides , Castaneda wanted to validate a theory he had been working on . He had observed many mimes ? peyote ceremonies in which the participants never ex-changed a word or a gesture , and yet afterward they would all agree that Mescalito , the spirit of peyote , had appeared to them and imparted a particular lesson . Hoping to find an explanation for this striking homogeneity of response , Castaneda theorized that a covert leader in the group cued the members . Their consensus , then , constituted a " separate reality . " He presented his theory to don Juan . " You 're deranged ! " don Juan exclaimed . " Why should anyone be bothered with cueing at such an important time as a mitote ? Do you think anyone ever fools around with Mescalito ? " He added that the agreement about Mescalito and his lesson arose from the fact that the participants see , as opposed to just looking . Seeing was , he said , a bodily awareness of the world as it is , rather than the description @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We learn to think about everything . . . and then we train our eyes to look as we think about the things we look at . But when a man learns to see , he realizes that he can no longer think about the things he looks at , and if he can not think about what he looks at everything becomes unimportant . " When a man learns to see the world , it shows itself to be a fleeting , undifferentiated stream of phenomena . To nudge Castaneda into seeing , don Juan brought in don Genaro , an eagle among sorcerers . In A Separate Reality : Further Conversations with Don Juan , * Castaneda 's second underground hit that continues to sell at the rate of 1,001 ) copies a week , he wrote about the superb artistry don Genaro used to startle him into dropping the chains of reason . Don Genaro pirouetted across impossible waterfalls , made the air roar with invisible avalanches , and transported himself ten miles in an instant . The confused apprentice responded with anguish . " My mind refused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' " lie wrote . " I began to weep . For the first time in my life I felt the encumbering weight of my reason . " Although he had failed to see , he had , don Juan assured him , gained in knowledge . In a third book , Journey to Ixtlan : The Lessons of Don Juan , * * Castaneda reevaluated his apprenticeship . He could no longer explain as drug-induced hallucinations the remarkable events he had witnessed ? too many things had happened to him when he was straight . Psycho- tropics were only one means of disrupting the flow of perceptual interpretations that make up our particular description of the world . There were , he wrote , " certain states of awareness in which the reality of everyday life is altered because the flow of interpretation , which ordinarily runs uninterruptedly , has been stopped by a set of circumstances alien to that flow . " The soreerie description of the world was alien to his normal flow . The collision occurred one day when don Genaro made Castaneda 's locked car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the disruption for a few minutes and then collapsed . Beating a dead horse C ASTANEDA 'S BOOKS HAVE BEEN CALLED anthropological classics by his colleagues , and the novelist Joyce Carol Oates has praised their beautiful construction , faultless dialogue , unforgettable characterization , and novelistic momentum . It would be dishonest for me to pretend that his works have had other than a strong effect on me . They helped me organize my own responses to altered states of consciousness and immersed me in the same sensation I 'd had when 1 once read a thorough but highly simplified explanation of the theory of general relativity . In both cases , separate and alien realities were methodically constructed , brick by brick , with occasional incomprehensibilities ? but never mind , press on ? until suddenly I felt pried open . A veil had been momentarily ripped away to reveal awesome forces at work , bending everything into a suspiciously familiar picture with a drastically altered perspective . " Carlos , " I now ask , " would you say that sorcerers are the equivalent of nuclear physicists ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replies . We pull up beside a park and get out of the bus . " The tradition goes back to Paleolithic hunting groups , but by the Lime of the Aztec empire they were scientists . Physicists work together and build on one another 's findings , though ; the world of the sorcerer is that of the individual , the individual in front of his death . " We choose a spot in the park . He sets up aluminum folding chairs with orange and gold webbing and we sit down . " Brujos have sat in these chairs -- these chairs have power ! " he says merrily . He certainly does not resemble the inert undergraduate sophist he claims he once . was . He is alert , inquisitive , and convivial , and he gives the impression of having the sort of intelligence that never tires . He has short black curly hair , clear brown eyes , and a stocky compact build . He wears a yellow drip-dry shirt and brown suit trousers , and he 's gut a narrow-brimmed canvas hat that he places on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head is the trunk of a palm tree , and beyond that , the vast blues of the Pacific Ocean and the afternoon sky . " Gazing off at the cosmos like the mystics do , " he says , Ringing his arms upward , " is like beating a dead horse . There 's so much to this marvelous world right in front of us , but we do n't perceive it because our reason screens out so much . Of course I came from ' out there , ' and I 'll return . Meanwhile , I 'm on a stupendous loop , a journey of power ? life . " He traces his route in the air with his finger . " And my body is all I have . It is an exquisite instrument of awareness . I must make excellent use of it . " Building T HE WORLD AS WE SEE . IT is composed of perceptual units you can call ' glosses . ' For example , ' building ' is a gloss . " He points to a white , unfinished high-rise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' building ' have to be present before we say it is a building . It may be impossible to determine the parts of ' building , ' and yet we all know and agree about what a building is , because we 've learned to gloss ' building . ' We learn to gloss very soon after we 're born . It 's not bound up with language at all . The only beings who do not have glosses are autistic children ; glosses are based on agreement , and autistic children do n't make agreements with the world . Due to some physiological difference , they 're not members ? membership occurs when everyone agrees on a certain description of the world . Of that building . But there 's more to that building than you think . " Personal history and fog ON JUAN INSISTED that there were no coinci- dences or accidents and that the sorcerer had to be responsible for his total behavior . The magician worked to dissolve all boundaries ? between wakefulness and dreaming , between self and world , between past and present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apprentice manifest , responsive , and usable . He told Castaneda to surround himself with a fog ? to eliminate his social identity by erasing his past and making himself inaccessible to others . A few items from his personal history have , however , escaped erasure . He was born in Brazil in the late 1930s to a Sorcery is the praxis of phenomenology T HE WORLD OF MY FATHER is boring and sterile , " Carlos says with an impatient wave . " He wo n't talk to anybody who has n't read Plato . By ' world of my father ' I mean Western culture , the European tradition , with all its preconceptions . Don Juan says , ' Stop the preconditions , stop the preconceptions . ' Now , existentialism agrees : it says the world exists before our conception of it . But the philosophers never tell you how to dislodge yourself from meaning . Some can manage to rearrange the old glosses ? that 's what people Like Leary and Baba Ram Dass have done ? but it 's the sorcerer who can tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hat to the ground . " Sorcery is simply the praxis of phen onienology . " " What do you have to do ? " He gets effortlessly to his feet , drops his hands to his sides , curls his fingers , and lifts his gaze to just above the horizon . " You scan , like this , with your eyes slightly crossed so that they do n't focus , and you walk slowly along so that your cortex is flooded with images . The human brain relies a great deal on feature analysis , and this practice disrupts that process . Your brain is working so hard to sort out the flood of images that after a while you find you 're not able to think . Your internal monologue stops . You stop the flow of interpretations . Your perceptions become intricate and amazing . Now Fm able to sit for hours without talking to myself . " He sits down and talks about disruption of routine and how that can interrupt the flow of interpretations . You must continually try to do the unexpected . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and run away instead of answering . Startling things will begin to happen . " It 's the task of the sorcerer to interrupt the flow , and it 's the task of the apprentice to sustain that interruption . The ordinary person , however , feels that his life depends on keeping that flow going no matter what , and if you threaten it , he 'll protect himself by saying you 're crazy . " Carlos rolls his eyes and twirls his hands . " You can also break your routine perceptions by staring at the shadows among the leaves of a tree rather than at the leaves themselves , or by paying attention to the variety of sounds coming into your earsat any given moment . The body likes that sort of thing . " The goal of these practices is seeing . " Seeing is really perceiving with your body instead of your reason . The world is only a feeling . " He stands up again and spreads his arms wide . " First , you 're aware of particles glittering everywhere , like the dust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can take some of the dust from an actual moth and sprinkle it in the air around you as a preliminary exercise . Well , when the glitter clears away , you find you can see . God it is stupendous ! What don Juan does n't understand is that he can see that I can see , but I 'm not always sure about it myself . I 'm still in conflict with my reason . " He thumps his abdomen . " It gets me right here . The stress between my body and my reason is so great that I lose twenty pounds every time I visit him . But he wo n't help me any more . He says I know what to do now . " Carlos sits down again . " To a sorcerer , people can appear in an image shaped either like a mushroom or like a teacup . Once don Juan and I sat up all night in his house while he had me think of different people ? friends , professors , people I did n't even know , and don @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was always right about each one of them ? about their personalities . Then he told me to call up don Genaro . You know , don Genaro is truly a scary guy . He 's so powerful , and he could smash you without batting an eye . Well , I called him . " Suddenly he was before me , the way he always appears in real life ? not as a mushroom or teacup shape . He was laughing . ' Hello , Carlito , ' he said . ' Why did you call me ? ' " " Hey , wait , " I say . " You mean you really saw the flesh-and-hlood don Genaro materialize in front of you ? " " Well , " Carlos says , " I thought don Juan had tricked me . That he 'd known that eventually I 'd try to call up don Genaro and had him hiding outside . But don Genaro was a thousand miles away at the time . This was his nagual , his counterpart , Here 's how don Juan explained it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it stands is ' real . ' You see , what I 'm perceiving right now is really a recollection of what you were a fraction of a second ago . Plato said that all knowledge is recollection . Don Juan says all awareness is recollection and it 's possible to recollect two separate events at the same time . " Einstein 's separate reality feels to me as if it 's merging with don Juan 's separate reality , and my head is spinning . " Look , " Carlos goes on , " we say you ca n't be in two places simultaneously because we hold to a one-to-one relationship of the self to the universe . That may not necessarily be the case . The sorcerer tries to stop the relationship of subject to object . " Several weeks later , I realize what he means . Time is only a feeling . Dreaming hands and books REMARK ON THE FLUIDITY , the vividness , and fl the precision of Carlos 's writing . " That 's because I dream my books , " he says with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dreaming as a way of gaining power . First , you establish a familiar reference point , like your hands , and , as you dream , you keep returning to that image . You will yourself to do it . From there you can go on to analyze particular details in a given dream or choose what you want to dream about . In the afternoon , I go through the notebooks with all my field notes in them and translate them into English . Then I sleep in the early evening and dream what I want to write . " When I wake up , I can work all night . Everything has arranged itself smoothly in my head , and I do n't need to rewrite . My regular writing is actually very dry and labored . " Carlos and his ally ( - ) 1%1 JUAN HAD TOLD CARLOS that allies were DO that resembled dripping pieces of cloth but could assume any shape . In a psycho-tropic vision , Carlos saw his ally standing in a field in the garb of a Mexican peon . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to join the sorcerer 's world . When the apprentice learns to see , the ally comes to wrestle with him . if the apprentice is n't ready , he can turn his back and defend himself by thinking about the things he likes to do as a man . if the apprentice does decide to grab the ally , the struggle whirls him through the air , and if he is victorious , he becomes one with the ally and thus acquires superhuman powers . " The ally is a force , a gloss . It 's visualized , becomes accessible , and then it comes after you . That 's the facticity of that particular gloss Up until now , I have n't been ready to confront it . " Los Angeles stops being Los Angeles On the other hand , I ca n't live like an Indian . I 'm left only with the possibility of embracing the ally . " " Why are you so frightened ? If you succeed , you 'll have superhuman powers . " " But what if I fail ? And after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ordinary people appear to you as phantoms . Don Juan still visits his family , but for him they 're all phantoms . The only real person for don Genaro is don Juan . Sorcerers are passionate , intense men ? that 's why they 're drawn to such knowledge . But after they 're one with the ally , they 're spun away into an unknown place . Yet they keep trying to go home , fully aware that they ca n't . It 's very tragic ; their control over their loneliness is superb . Don Juan makes his passage on earth so light , so exquisite , that sometimes my body ca n't contain it . " Lie pauses . " Don Genaro can never go hack to his farm in Ixtlan , and , if I succeed in this final step , I can never come back to the Los Angeles I know . Arid I love it here . But don Juan is n't sure what might happen to me , since I 'm the first European ever to do this . There 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remained a human being . In fact , I 'm going to talk to him tomorrow . " I N Journey to Ixtlan , don Juan and don Genaro instruct Castaneda in ally-wrestling . The two nimble old men make a pretty good comedy team . Don Juan tells Castaneda to stand in a particular way and then to leap forward and grab . " He 's got to kiss his medallion first , " don Genaro interjected . Don Juan , with feigned severity , said that I had no medallions . " What about his notebooks ? " don Genaro insisted . " He 's got to do something with his notebooks . He 's got to put them down somewhere before he jumps , or maybe he 'll use his notebooks to beat the ally . " " I 'll be damned ! " don . Juan said with seemingly genuine surprise . " 1 have never thought of that . I bet it 'll be the first time an ally is beaten down to the ground with notebooks . " WHAT 'S AHEAD FOR YOU , Carlos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end and gain total membership in don Juan 's knowledge . I know the ally is waiting for me ? he can comic at any minute and now I 'm ready for him . I 've just completed a book on the formation of perceptual glosses . I have no loose ends now , no attachments , and I 'm strong ? that 's essential for defeating the ally . Wrestling with the ally is the final step for me , and it 's very frightening . But the alternative is a crappy one ? remaining in the world of my father and becoming a professor . I can no longer be an integral part of that world . CARLOS FOLDS LP his brujo 's chairs and puts them in the back of his bus . After a four-hour conversation , he shows no trace of weariness . " I still find a lot of my feelings untenable , " he says . " But there 's no going back . The journey to the end of the world is right now for me , " I think how unfortunate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of our description of the world and into an inaccessible one . " Oh , he back , " he says reassuringly .
