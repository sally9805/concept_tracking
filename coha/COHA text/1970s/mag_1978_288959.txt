A blazing Borg and a controlled Navratilova take Wimbledon <P> After two weeks of rain and royalty , of upsets on Centre Court and strawberries and cream in the members ' enclosure , the All-England tennis championships at Wimbledon finally got down to the business at hand : deciding who are the world 's finest tennis players . For the first time since 1972 , the two top-seeded men and the two top-seeded women in the game survived to do battle on Centre Court for the singles titles . On successive days , Chris Evert and Martina Navratilova and Bjorn Borg and Jimmy Connors - great young tennis stars in fine form - treated Wimbledon to rousing games of king and queen of the mountain . When it was over , Navratilova and Borg stood alone at the top . <P> Borg 's smashing 6-2 , 6-2 , 6-3 win brought him his third straight Wimbledon title , a feat last achieved by Fred Perry in the mid-1930s . It also brought the score in the six-year Borg-Connors rivalry , which has produced some of the most thrilling tennis ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the stormy American . <P> And once again , as in their last two matches , at Boca Raton , Fla. , and Tokyo earlier this year , the younger Borg ( now 22 , vs. 25 for Connors ) was clearly superior . His metronomic groundstrokes raked the corners of the court , upsetting Connors ' rhythm and preventing him from battling back with the laser passing shots and pinpoint volleys that are his best strokes . But it was Borg 's serve that made this the quickest ( 107 min. ) and most definitive Wimbledon men 's final since 1974 , when Connors pasted Ken Rosewall in a straight-set win . <P> Borg scored five aces and 19 outright winners on his whistling serve ; Connors was able to break service but once in twelve games . With Connors rocked back on his heels by the Swede 's boomers , Borg , who normally takes root at the baseline and whittles away with topspin ground-strokes , moved to the net to volley Jimmy 's returns . Until recently , the sight of Borg at the net was as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Ilie Nastase . But Borg charged to the front court frequently and effectively in his semifinal with The Netherlands ' Tom Okker , and decided to continue against Connors in the duel he called " one of my best matches ever . " <P> The women 's final between Chris Evert , 23 , and Czech Defector Martina Navratilova , 21 , offered drama of a different sort . Evert was coming back from her first tennis vacation since her debut as a 16-year-old at Forest Hills in 1971 . She won the first of her two Wimbledon singles titles at 19 , and has ruled the game with icy consistency ever since . But sated and weary , she temporarily abandoned the sport this winter . While Chris went home to her parents , Martina came home to her talents . Mastering an emotional temperament and harnessing her formidable gifts to new-found concentration and a newly designed " lucky dress , " Navratilova reeled off a string of indoor victories . For the first time since injury blunted Billie Jean King 's game and motherhood interrupted Evonne Goola-gong Cawley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hegemony .
