An argument has long smoldered in Wall Street over the tight rules that restrict membership in the clubby New York Stock Exchange . Mutual funds , insurance companies and other institutional investors can not join . Naturally they are resentful because they 1 ) account for well over half the trading volume on the exchange , and 2 ) pay some $800 million a year in commissions to member brokers on their trading . The institutions have become all the more displeased because brokerage houses in recent years have started their own mutual funds and now have about 70 of them . The brokerages collect commissions when they buy and sell stocks for their own funds . <P> Last week Dreyfus Corp. , the independent mutual-fund giant , applied for membership on the New York Stock Exchange . The action was intended to force the exchange 's governors to make an embarrassing choice : either admit Dreyfus or explain why member brokers should be allowed to run their own mutual funds . Paradoxically , Dreyfus Chairman Howard Stein ( TIME cover , Aug. 24 ) is a strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " If the brokers are to be allowed to compete with the institutions , then the institutions must not work under a financial handicap . " <P> If the mutual funds do break into the exchange , brokers fear that they will lose so much in commissions that quite a few houses will be forced to fold . For their part , the mutual-fund men contend that there is more at stake than the row over commissions . They say that the brokers ' entry into the mutual-fund business raises grave questions of conflict of interest . One reason : brokers may be tempted to " churn " the portfolios of their own mutual funds-that is , buy and sell excessively in order to earn commissions . Last week 's move by Dreyfus is not so much aimed at compelling the exchange to allow mutual funds to go into the brokerage business , as forcing the brokerages out of the mutual-fund business . <P> If the exchange refuses Stein 's application-as it seems likely to do-it may well invite an antitrust suit , on grounds of perpetuating unfair competition . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both by the Congress and the new chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission , who is expected to be appointed this week .
