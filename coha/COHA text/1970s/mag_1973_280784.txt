" We are not going to stay in power indefinitely . We only want to leave the country structured so the people of Chile can have the government they deserve . " <P> So said Air Force General Gustavo Leigh Guzmn , a member of Chile 's four-man ruling junta , at a press conference last week . It was not true , Leigh insisted , that he and his fellow generals were fascists , as their enemies had charged . Instead , he claimed , the junta was merely taking temporary measures to rid the country of the Marxist disease spread by the late President Salvador Allende Gossens . The military 's goal was to achieve " reconstruction " and " normalcy . " Once these were reached , said Leigh , the generals would return to barracks . <P> Possibly yes , possibly no . But certainly not for some time . Last week the junta stepped up its campaign against Marxism into a virtual holy war aimed at destroying anyone and anything vaguely connected with Allende . Thousands of people were jailed without hearings . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shot by firing squads after summary courts-martial for hostile acts against the new government . Man hunts were still being conducted for some of Allende 's major political collaborators , and long-haired youths were still being subjected to instant haircuts . <P> Mass Prison . Reported TIME Correspondent Rudolph Rauch from Santiago : " It is clear that we are not seeing a caretaker government . The most optimistic person I have talked to does not expect the country to be ruled again by civilians before 1977 at the earliest . " <P> In pursuit of its concept of normalcy , the military herded 7,000 suspects into Santiago 's soccer stadium for lack of a better mass prison elsewhere . Among the prisoners were several Americans , including Adam Garrett-Schesch , 31 , a University of Wisconsin history researcher , and his wife Patricia , 30 , a sociologist . Released and allowed to leave Chile , the couple contended that between 400 and 500 captives had been shot during the time they were held in the stadium . <P> Correspondent Rauch , who was allowed to inspect the interior of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mass-execution sites . Some prisoners were lounging in the bleachers . But , Rauch noted , " there was not more than one-tenth of the people we had been told were in the stadium . When asked where the others were , the stadium commandant replied , ' Some prefer the sun , while others prefer the shade . Those you do not see prefer the shade . ' " <P> At Santiago 's General Cemetery where he awaited the cortege of Poet Pablo Neruda ( see following story ) , Rauch noticed on the wall of an adjacent morgue a list of 300 people whose bodies were to be claimed by relatives . <P> Next day the list was gone , along with a later list of 120 names , which had been tacked up and then hurriedly pulled down at army order . According to an official of the morgue , it normally handled about twelve corpses a week . <P> Street Fires .
