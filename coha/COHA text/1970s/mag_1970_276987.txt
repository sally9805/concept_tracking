In the beginning , there was total darkness . Then charts blinked blindingly on and off five screens as an electronic-music sound track filled the New York Hilton ballroom with Tarzanlike cries , boos and whistles . Next , harp music played while the screens flashed images of the sybaritic life-money , an island sunset , girls . Finally , a slender , gold-shirted young man with flowing sideburns mounted the podium . To belt out a rock paean to hedonism ? No , to denounce the Securities and Exchange Commission for not sufficiently analyzing the economic impact of its regulatory decisions . <P> The audience was not disappointed . It consisted of more than 2,100 brokers , bankers and other businessmen , who had paid $325 each last week ( all together nearly $700,000 ) to attend the third annual Institutional Investor conference , an affair that could have been called Gold Diggers of 1970 . They expected , with good reason , to be provided with both entertainment and provocative comments on the management of money . Those are the elements that the speaker , 28-year-old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fastest-growing businesses on Wall Street and a personal net worth of about $3,000,000 . <P> Kaplan 's conclaves , held in the U.S. and Europe , feature what he describes as " a bit of show biz " and big-name speakers who get fees as high as $3,000 . They discourse on trends and ideas in and out of the market that Kaplan thinks will interest investors . At last week 's three-day affair , Consumer Crusader Ralph Nader urged institutional investors to press corporate managements to do more about safety and pollution control . Mutual Fund Millionaire Bernard Cornfeld warned that the Viet Nam War and U.S. social turmoil were making American investments less attractive to Europeans , and Newscaster David Brinkley spoke about the inefficiency of Government bureaucracy . <P> Mini-Empire . A former economist at the American Stock Exchange , Kaplan has built a mini-empire based on the exchange of ideas . In 1967 he thought that the influential men who run investing institutions-mutual funds , pension funds , trusts-should have a magazine written specifically for them . With modest bankrolling from Gerald Bronfman ( of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Institutional Investor . " The Double Eye , " as I.I .. is dubbed , is now an ad-packed monthly that is sent free to 20,000 portfolio managers and big brokers . The magazine quickly became the foundation for a company , Institutional Investor Systems , that today also publishes Corporate Financing ( six issues a year ) , three business directories , and transcripts and tapes of business seminars . In addition , it organizes conferences for businessmen and bankers . Results for fiscal 1969 : a net profit of $213,000 on revenues of $ 1,777,000 . <P> Such a business could be staid . But Kaplan has taken aim at a growing audience-basically the younger , more aggressive , often fun-loving money managers . They appreciate pizazz as well as ideas . He gives them both . The Institutional Investor , for example , goes in for Pop art ; one cover , on the New York Stock Exchange specialist system , showed a cavalry and Indians scene . The magazine is edited by George J. W. Goodman , the " Adam Smith " who wrote The Money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year in salary , bonus and profits on stock options .
