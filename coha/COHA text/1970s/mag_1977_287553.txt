The FBI had a surprise for urban and suburban dwellers fending off muggers , sluggers and druggers when it announced that for the first time in four years , the U.S. crime rate has not increased . The number of violent crimes in 1976 actually declined by 5% . <P> Now for the bad news : <P> <P> It seems improbable that a brotherhood as violent as the Mafia is becoming still more savage . It also seems unlikely that teams of professional hit men armed with silencer-equipped .22-cal. automatic pistols are roaming the land , with at least 20 " executions " to their credit in the past two years . Finally , it seems unthinkable that the case of the .22 hits could be a direct challenge by the Mob to the U.S. Government . <P> But the FBI fears all this is true , with good reason . Two of the victims were FBI informants . Four others were potential prosecution witnesses . Two of the killings - five months apart - were committed with the same gun . Says an FBI agent : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a reason for doing that . They 're giving us a message . " <P> Mafia Hot Line . Detective fiction has it that the .22-cal. pistol with its tiny one-ounce slug is a gnat swatter , at its worst a woman 's weapon snatched from a purse to dispatch an errant lover . No self-respecting all-pro killer would carry one . The facts , however , are otherwise . The CIA has long preferred the .22 . The agency 's predecessor , the Office of Strategic Services , developed a silencer-equipped Hi-Standard .22-cal. automatic pistol during World War II . It turned out to be the only production-model handgun that can be effectively silenced , and it has been the favorite of spooks ever since . Now , says the FBI , the .22 has found new fans . <P> The Mob 's change in execution methods is exemplified by February 's killing of Mafia Consigliere Frank ( " Bomp " ) Bompensiero , 71 . Shortly before 8 p.m. on Feb. 10 , Bomp walked from his San Diego home to a nearby public telephone booth , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In his pocket was a notebook containing coded balance sheets of loan-shark usury payments and lists of coded phone numbers . The numbers turned out to be those of other public telephones scattered through California and Nevada . The phones constitute a West Coast Mafia hot-line system . <P> At designated hours on specified days , Bomp would call a San Francisco number to chat with a sidekick named Jimmy Fratianno ; at other times he would dial a Las Vegas booth for messages from Tony Spilotro , a Chicago gang heavyweight . He also received calls at the booth . A Mafia member for 40 years , Bomp was a consequential figure in the Mob hierarchy . He was also an informant for the FBI , the highest-placed Mafioso in that role . <P> Popping Noise . The FBI has no idea whom Bompensiero telephoned that night , but they know one of his callers fingered him for execution . The old man was an easy target . As he walked away from the phone booth toward his home , he was dropped by a .22-cal. slug that entered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a second shot near the right ear . No shots were heard . <P> <P> When the body was found , the notebook was missing .
