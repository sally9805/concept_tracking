txt Never mind that baseball 's Los Angeles Dodgers have won their National League divisional championship with ease and set an attendance record in the bargain . What bothers Walter O'Malley , the 74-year-old owner of the team , at the moment is a water hose . In his office overlooking Dodger Stadium , baseball 's reigning patriarch-jabs an accusatory finger through a thick bank of cigar smoke toward the hose the ground crew uses on the infield grass . " In a little while , " he says , his eyes narrowing , " some guy who makes $6 an hour will come out and hold that hose . I spent $600,000 on the most advanced irrigation system available , and the ground crew wo n't use it because holding that hose is more fun . That burns me . " Little escapes the penetrating gaze of Walter O'Malley , especially when it concerns wasted money qwq In regular-season home games this year , the Dodgers drew 3,347,845 fans , becoming the first U.S. professional team in any sport to exceed three million in a season 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the general secrecy , the Dodgers ' gross revenue for the year will probably be about $20 million , more than double that of the average major-league team . One team whose finances are known is the publicly held Baltimore Orioles . Last season , the Orioles had net income of $580,788 , on revenue of $7.2 million . Only the Cincinnati Reds team , however , is believed to approach the Dodgers in profitability . A study of the Reds ' finances was conducted last year by the Ralph Nader-supported Fight to Advance the Nation 's Sports , or FANS . The group says it picked the Reds because , unlike the Dodgers , they " epitomize the monopoly-gouging approach characteristic of many major professional sports teams . " The study put Cincinnati 's pretax profit at $6.7 million last year , on revenue of $13.8 million . The Reds drew 2.5 million fans in 1977 , when the Dodgers ' attendance was just under three million . Estimate " Too High " The Reds have termed the FANS estimates too high , and Peter O'Malley , Dodger president @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Reds " too high for anyone , " including , presumably , the Dodgers . Of course , ' baseball owners frequently have been accused of poor-mouthing on profits . There have been rumors of late that the Dodger franchise and related real-estate holdings will be sold to a major corporation for as much as $60 million because of Mr. O'Malley 's age and declining health and the specter of steep inheritance taxes . Peter O'Malley denies the reports . Meanwhile , the rich get richer . Having won their second straight division title , the Dodgers are competing in the National League playoffs that started last night . If they make it to the World Series , the Dodger president concedes , this will be their most profitable season , How do they do it ? Some explanations are easy : A consistently competitive team I only four times in 21 seasons in Los Angeles has it lost more games than it has won ) , excellent weather ( only nine rainouts at . home in that time ) , and a market of more than 10 million potential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point also to the business acumen of the O'Malleys . " They 're just godd businessmen , " says Bowie Kuhn. baseball commissioner . " They could make money on , widgets . " Golf Handicaps The elder O'Malley , long the key force behind the Dodgers and , many contend , the most powerful figure in baseball , dominates the show . He is a raconteur and a bit of a con man . Remarking that his golf handicap slipped from 18 to 33 after recent surgery , he winks and says , " That 's OK , I can win money at 33 . " O'Malley watchers like to tell of the spring he opened a new golf course at the Dodgers ' Vero Beach , Fla. , training site , although the sand traps had n't yet been put in . Why , they wondered , was the owner carefully noting the locations of golf partner James Mulvey 's drives ? The next spring , they found out : That 's where the sand traps were installed . Mr. O'Malley instilled strong management principles into the Dodger organization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " In the old days , " says Danny Goodman , the Dodgers ' /director of advertising , novelties and souvenirs , " the publicity guy handled everything . " Another key to success , Mr. O'Malley contends , is time . He and Calvin Griffith of Please Turn to Page 35 , Column I Perhaps the Dodgers ' greatest promotional tools , however , are the tonsils of yin Scully , whose voice is heard on the 22 radio stations in four states that carry Dodger broadcasts . Mr. Scully , considered by many to be the nation 's best baseball announcer , came with the team from Brooklyn and is given much of the credit for selling the game to local fans . He now limits his broadcasting to home games and a few road games , partly because he has a CBS broadcasting contract as well . The Dodgers broadcast all of their games on radio this year . but only 28 games , all of them on the road , were on local television . The O'Malleys believe that too much TV exposure reduces prospective attendance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revenue this season , including the team 's share of the national television contract , will be about $2.8 million . Low Prices for Fans Ticket prices at Dodger Stadium average $3.59. the fourth lowest in baseball and the lowest among the perennial powers I the Yankees ' average of $5.19 is the highest ) . The Dodgers ' general admission for adults has been 52 ever since the franchise was switched to Los Angeles . and the top-priced ticket has gone up only $1 , to the current 54.50 , in that 21-year period . These policies have built considerable fan loyalty . While only five other teams out of the 26 in the major leagues drew more than two million fans this year . the Dodgers have topped that mark in 14 of their 21 years here . The low ticket prices and merchandise giveaways aimed primarily at children help nurture the next generation of fans . " I ca n't imagine an economic reason for holding prices down , so I have to assume they had some loyalty to their fans , " Peter Gruenstein , executive director @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dodgers make up whatever they may lose on ticket prices in concessions . " They make as much in concessions as many teams make overall , " a baseball executive says . Each of the 3.3 million fans at the park this year is estimated to have spent nearly $2 on food and souvenirs . The average of 12,000 cars at each game yields $2 a car . While the ascendancy of flamboyant. star-struck Tommy Lasorda to the manager 's chair has turned the clubhouse into a celebrity hangout for such as Frank Sinatra and Don Rickles , Walter O'Malley sings a song for the little man . " That guy in the bleachers is the most important fan we have , " he says . " The celebrities will be the first to desert us if we start losing . " The Dodger family is a " fiction they like to perpetuate , " says one source who has frequent dealings with the team . " They are a business and like any other club , they act like a business . Players are assets . " A Salary Dispute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sosa last year . He announced he would seek an arbitration hearing on a salary dispute , and on the same day he was to formally apply for the hearing , he was placed on waivers , offering him for sale to other teams . Mr. Campanis de-rues that is why Mr. Sosa was cut adrift and now pitches for the Oakland A 's . " The club is often officious and overbearing with players . " contends Marvin Miller , executive director of the Major League Baseball Players Association . " It 's a throwback to the old attitude that this is our ball-club and these are our players . and if you want to play here , you do what we say . " If that 's true , most of the players do n't seem to mind . " Things are different than they used to be , " catcher Joe Ferguson says . " You have to think like a businessman and accept what they say about you . But the organization , on the whole , is very supportive . " The Dodgers are indeed very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to maintain an image for the team , " he says . " They have an extensive program to woo the media . They try to keep the Dodger image out front because that sells tickets . " The front office , however , has never pushed him in a direction he did n't want to go . he says . In the past 21 years of enormous financial success , the Dodgers ' image has been extensively revamped , announcer Vin Scully says . In the early days in Brooklyn . the Dodgers were " the Burns . " who were " always a step ahead of foreclosure . " Later , when the team became a financial and artistic success , they still " were always a dollar short , " he says . " always losing to the lordly Yankees . " and the bum image lingered . Famed hobo clown Emmett Kelly even performed at games But times have changed . " Look at this beautiful place . " Mr. Scully says , sweeping his hand across the panorama of Dodger Stadium , " Ai n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
