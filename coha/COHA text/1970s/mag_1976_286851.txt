Few places on earth could have been less auspicious to artists than New Mexico two centuries ago . The borderlands of what Cortes had fondly supposed to be the gold-stuffed kingdom of Cibola , New Mexico was a backward , poor , remote fief of Spain , all but forgotten in Madrid . The Franciscan friars , whose missions had supplied the chief form of local government in the colony , had been withdrawn . Most of the white community leadership came from a group of masochistically deranged Christian fakirs , the Penitent brotherhood , whose way of praising their redeemer was to imitate his Passion by flogging themselves with wire-tipped scourges . It was not , to put it mildly , a humanistic culture , but it was still capable of producing art , of a coarse and vivid sort . <P> Last month a large exhibition of it went on view at the Fine Arts Gallery of San Diego- " The Cross and the Sword , " organized by Art Historian Jean Stern , a specialist in the art of the American Southwest . The 170 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , provide a most suggestive picture of the culture of the place and period . The show is the main event of San Diego 's bicentennial-year celebration . <P> The religious art is mainly of two kinds : bultos or wooden sculptures , and retablos , paintings on adzed panels . They are invariably primitive . Folk carvers of devotional objects in Europe had a whole bag of tricks , derived from professional sculpture , to lend variety to their images . But the santos of New Mexico are almost always frontal ; they stare at you with the stiff , doleful air of prisoners not fully released from their original block of wood , and even a representation of the three-headed , one-bodied Holy Trinity ( see color page ) looks like a detail from a chain gang . This kind of rustic simplicity was partly dictated by the poor tools the carvers had at their disposal - sculpture was more a matter of whittling and hacking than of carving , since woodworking chisels were all but unknown . <P> Pieties and Terrors . Some artists - the professionals known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such man , who flourished between 1805 and 1845 , is called the " Chili Painter " for his habit of surrounding his figures with decorative borders of that fiery vegetable . But in general , whether Indian or Spanish , priests or laymen , the artists submerged their individuality in the demands of iconography . One does not look for subtlety of meaning in the santos . They are religious propaganda of the most basic sort : cult objects designed to hammer fundamental pieties and terrors into illiterate minds , heavily emphasizing suffering and violence .
