txt About $1 billion of the national budget savings that President Carter has ordered to keep next year 's Federal deficit under $30 billion has come out of the energy budget , according to Government and industry officials . When the Administration sends the budget to Congress on Monday , those officials said , it plans to propose spending $8.1 billion in the next fiscal year for the Department of Energy . That will be an 11 percent cut from the estimated $9.1 billion that the department is calculated to spend this year . The $8.1 billion sum was a compromise , the officials said , that was reached after a tempestuous fight between the department and the Office of Management and Budget in the White House that illuminated vast differences in priorities between the two . Balanced Budget Sought The Department of Energy , headed by James R. Schlesinger , was charged by the President in April 1977 with fighting the " moral equivalent of war " to resolve the energy crisis . Since then , the Office of Management and Budget has been given the task @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as to redeem a campaign pledge by Mr. Carter to bring the budget into balance . The budget figure does not include spending for the strategic petroleum rem serve , for which new funds are now expected to be requested . The reserve , which is running far behind schedule , will be financed by about $3 billion left over from the current budget , . the officials said . But the Department of Energy 's budget does include between $1.5 billion and $1.6 billion for research , development , and production of nuclear weapons . That sum , officials said , was intended to improve " deteriorating facilities " throughout the nation 's nuclear weapons complex . The money that has been squeezed out of the 1980 budget for the Department of Energy was said to be both $1 billion less than the department is spending in the current fiscal year and $1 billion less than the department requested this year for next year 's expenditures . The Department of Energy originally asked for $9.1 billion in appropriations for the fiscal year that begins next October , some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The spending request for the 1980 budget was set initially by the department at $8.2 billion . But the Office of Management and Budget , headed by James T. , slashed the appropriations request by 23 percent to $7 billion and the projected spending figure to $6.9 billion That prompted a strong letter of appeal from Mr. Schlesinger in December asking the budget office to restore $1.1 billion in apipropriations and $785 million in spending . Cut is Considered Significant Inquiries to industry and government officials disclosed that most of Mr. Schlesinger 's appeals were successful , bringing the figures to slightly over $8 billion each . But that is still a significant cut , considering that inflation has eaten away about 7 percent of the dollar 's value over the last year . In his December letter , Mr. Schlesinger said that the budget office and his department " appear to hold a divergent viewpoint with regard to how long the nation can wait to begin making use of those energy resources which provide an alternative to domestic and imported oil . " The department asked for $224 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ budget office sliced $92 million from that , and Mr. Schlesinger asked for $80 million to be put back . Synthetic Gas Priority Sought Similarly , the Energy Department wanted $234 million to speed commercial application of synthetic gas . The budget office cut that entirely . Mr. Schlesinger asked that $98 million be restored . In a third cut , the budget office pared a request for $130 million to help develop small hydroelectric projects to $14 million . Mr. Schlesinger asked that $38 million of that be put back . In the nuclear field , which has long been a point of contention between the Department of Energy and many members of the White House staff , the budget office cut almost in half a request for $456 million to manage nuclear wastes coming from defense programs . Mr. Schlesinger said : " I find this totally unacceptable " and urged that funding be restored to the level originally requested . In each case , the officials said , most of what Mr. Schlesinger asked for was restored .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
