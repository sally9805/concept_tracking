txt Nelson Algren , Chicago author in exile , has settled into his new home in Paterson , N. J. He is living in a $257-a-month apartment in a neighliorhood of two-family homes , a half-hour 's walk from downtown Paterson , according to a story in a New Jersey newspaper , the Bergen County Record . " I got the apartment from this rooming homes agency , " he said . " I went in and asked , ' Do you have an apartment ? ' Then I gave them the right answers to the two questions  --  you know , ' Are you married ? ' and ' Do you have a pet ? ' I said I was married and did n't have a pet . Those are the right answers . Since I 'm not married , I suppose I could always marry my pet if I wanted one . " Algren finds Paterson " a pleasant little country town . I have no plans beyond this . I like the climate . I like the moon coming up . I like the clothes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hill . I 'll just stay here and review books . " The latest joke In Washington is that Carl Albert , the diminutive speaker of the House , was with Wilbur Mills and Fanne Fox the night of the Tidal Basin episode ? he was hiding in the glove compartment . The joke is just another example of heightism , according to the New York Daily News , which contends that making fun of short people is the last refuge of the bigot . Short people react by trying to appear taller or if that is n't possible , making fun of their height . Sen. John Tower of Texas , who is " just under 5 feet 6 inches , " introduces himself with : " My name is Tower , but I do n't . " Among those most sensitive about height are romantic movie stars . And their fans are rabid in their protectiveness . A New York magazine writer said that when he implied Robert Redford was short he is about 5 feet 10 inches ) a woman wrote " As good looking as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him 6 feet tall . If he wanted to be 7 feet tall , I 'd walk on my knees . " For the average person , a shopping spree might consist of buying a couple of dresses , shoes to match , a versatile coat , and , to really splurge , a nice little scarf . For the Gabor sisters , Eva and Zsa Zsa , one recent shopping session consisted of more than $40,000 worth of furs , including sables , a white floor-length fox coat , a black rabbit poncho dyed to resemble ermine , and a multi-color fox fling . The sisters made their purchases at Bonwit Teller 's fur salon when they were in Chicago appearing in " Arsenic and Old Lace . " " They were very , very charming , " said Irwin Ware , who owns the salon . " On television they act kind of screwy , you know , and in person they are the same way . But since it 's not being put on for the public , it seems very cute . " Alistair Cooke , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to explain America to the British and to his fellow Americans , is worried that the United States has developed symptoms similar to those that killed ancient Rome . " I think I recognize here several of the symptoms of the decline of Rome : A mounting love of show of luxury ; a widening gap between the very rich and the very poor ; an obsession with sex ; freakishness in the arts . In the past decade America has demonstrated the Roman folly of exercising military might in places remote from the centers of power . There is , too , a general desire to live off the state . Yet the original institutions of this country still have great vitality ; the Republic can be kept , but only if we care to keep it . " Artist Salvador Dali always has had a penchant for the bizarre . Recently he held court at a series of Sunday night dinners at Trader Vic 's in New York where the guests were .. . ah , different . According to one observer , there was " a weird @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and limbless folk Dali favors for his models nowadays . One woman was dressed as an enormous red bird , another guest , Jeff Fenholt , who played the title role In " Jesus Christ Superstar , " announced he was composing music : " I am the source of God and I have the talent of the masters . " Deli himself did n't appear to be having that good a time . Sitting in a fan-backed wicker chair , he said : " I like money . I come to America every year , make money , then disappear to spend it in Europe . I am impotent . Mortals make embryos ; I make art . " It has not been an easy time for King Kong . The big ape has a featured role in Bette Midler 's new show , the Clams on a Half Shell Revue , which opened in New York Monday . But before the Divine Miss M. and Kong got to Broadway , they played Philly and there were a few problems . In the first act Bette is wishing for true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ midnight blue pile carpeting I and sporting a movable arm . She nestles in Kong 's hand singing " Lullaby of Broadway " to him . But in Philly Kong got caught in a light batten and crashed to the stage , leaving Bette stranded in his arm , which works rather like a Chicago Fire Department snorkel . At a New York preview the air conditioning blew Kong into the heating pipes , where he got stuck . As if this were n't enough , Kong  --  who is equipped to roll his eyes , open his mouth , and drool  --  short-circuited the entire act during one rehecrsal . Bette said of her experience with Kong : " I was sitting up there thinking I was about to die . My whole life flashed before my eyes . It was so boring . "
