All roads leading to Athens were plastered with billboards saying NAI ( yes ) in bold white against a blue background with the legend VOTE YES FOR DEMOCRACY . IT IS NOW IN YOUR HANDS . Having quelled last May 's naval revolt against his junta 's six-year rule and deposed exiled King Constantine , Greek Strongman George Papadopoulos offered his countrymen last Sunday a chance to vote-but not much of a choice . <P> In voting ochi ( no ) , Greeks could merely embarrass the regime by refusing Papadopoulos ' request for them to legitimize his rule . He vowed in a television address not to resign and " not to be overthrown by a vote of rejection . " Whether Greeks voted yes to accept a so-called republic and permit parliamentary elections next year or no to protest abolition of the monarchy , the outcome was the same-continued iron-fisted rule by Papadopoulos . Greeks could not abstain from voting , since by law they must either vote or risk going to jail . The referendum , in short , was a charade . <P> Expectedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vote . Former political leaders , who banded together in a group called the Committee for the Restoration of Legality in Greece , were barred from staging a rally in Omonia Square in Athens , while busloads of docile supporters were sent to many government nai demonstrations elsewhere . Ochi posters were nowhere to be seen . <P> Independent-minded and contentious , Greeks have not taken kindly to such cynicism . Said a veteran U.S. diplomat in Athens : " I have never seen them so frustrated , angered and united as they are on this plebiscite . " <P> Though he clearly wanted public endorsement for his proposed government , Papadopoulos appeared only once on TV . He took no other part in the campaign . He wanted to be " a good sport , " explained Information Minister Byron Stamatopoulos . " Since he has no opponents , it would not have been fair " to campaign too much . To which cynics replied that there was no reason for Papadopoulos to campaign any harder .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
