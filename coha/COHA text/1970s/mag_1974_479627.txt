AMONG LOVERS OF nonhuman organisms , I stand somewhat to the right of center . I would never go out of my way to run over a dog or step on a cat , nor would I torment birds in winter by setting out pieces of plastic bread . When I speak to plants I am invariably civil , though seldom genuinely warm . Still , I have avoided people who allow their cats to molest visitors or who send Christmas cards with the tag line , " And Foxie says , ' Me too ! ' " 1 was , then , rather surprised to discover that several of my acquaintances had a consuming interest in birds . Had they been straightforward with me , I could have written them off early , but the webs of interaction and affection had formed and I was stuck with them and their peculiar passion . At first , I teased them with gentle wit and ironic inquiry . But in time I developed genuine curiosity about why these vital , intelligent , and otherwise normal people would drive four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said to be feeding , or fly to the Yucatan on the off-chance of finding a Turquoisebrowed Motmot perched in the Mayan ruins . Many birders ? " Do n't call us birdwatchers " ? trace their fascination with avian life to early childhood and admit to a certain nonrational quality about the whole enterprise . Ben Feltner , a Houstonian who serves as a professional guide for individual and group birding tours , is typical when he says , " I just like to see what birds are doing . My earliest memories were of birds . Watching birds has been the one consuming thing of my life . It is almost a disease . " When pressed , however , most veteran birders can provide plausible justifications for their odd pursuit . Victor Emanuel , a prominent Texas birder , recalls " standing on the edge of the Grand Canyon and having a strong urge to jump , to involve myself with the canyon . Just at that moment , a Clark 's Nutcracker jumped out of its nest and flew into the canyon . Howcould anyone not envy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are strikingly beautiful ? not just peacocks and parrots and cardinals but hundreds of species that good binoculars can transform from little gray blobs into stunning , sharply delineated patterns of yellow and red and blue and black . Others are intrinsically interesting to watch , evidence perhaps that God not only exists but likes amusement parks . Girding also offers an opportunity to relate to the environment at a level difficult for most city-dwellers . A good birder notices what kind of bushes or trees are in an area , whether the water is fresh or brackish , how fast the wind is blowing , and what the weather is going to be the next day . But for a growing number of intensely active enthusiasts , freedom , aesthetics . and environment run a poor second to sport . It has been the sport-birders who have most resisted the term " birdwatcher . " Ben Feltner explains that " the term has bad connotations . When you think of birdwatching , you think of little old ladies oohing and aahing over a Vermilion Flycatcher . I do n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are doing . " What they are doing does , in fact , share a number of the enduring features of the more established sports . To those of a predatory bent , birding offers all the pleasures of hunting ? rising early , wading through swamps , sitting in bogs for long periods , and fending off the attacks of insects and reptiles ? without the disadvantages of being restricted by a bag limit on a small number of species or the stigma attached to blood sport . Like skiing or scuba diving or canoeing , it can be grueling and sometimes dangerous ; like golf , it can be played on a variety of courses in a knockabout or highly disciplined manner . It can be done individually or in teams . And like the crown jewel of sports . ( I mean baseball , of course ) , it offers boundless possibilities for keeping records . 88 The great bird count HE BEST-KNOWN EVENT in competitive bird1,1 ing is the annual Christmas Count , in which teams of birders all over America enumerate all the species they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Although the Christmas Counts ( which in 1900 involved 26 persons , and in 1973 over 15,000 , in more than 1,000 different teams ) operate under the Audubon Society , the society has tended in recent years to deemphasize the sporting aspects of birding in favor of broader ecological concerns . Today , the more hot-blooded competitors have flocked to the five-year-old American Birding Association , headquartered in Austin , Texas . In sport birding , as encouraged by the ABA , one is judged by the size and quality of one 's lists . Virtually all birders keep a " life list " of all the species they have ever seen . The best list in the world belongs to Stuart Keith of the American Museum of Natural History in New York City , who has birded all the major areas of the world and seen over 5,000 of the approximately 8,000 known species . Obviously , a list of this magnitude is possible only for the idle rich or those whose jobs involve extensive travel . Less cosmopolitan birders concentrate more on the American Ornithological Union ( AOU @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and assorted islands ) and regard 600 as a big-league list , or on individual states : a mark of 80 percent is required to merit a reputation for having thoroughly birded a given state . Because most people prefer games that end before they do , life lists do not fully satisfy the competitive drive of many birders . For them the ABA has encouraged other types of contests . Perhaps the most exciting is the Big Day , in which an individual or party tries to see or hear as many birds as possible in a calendar day . For a successful Big Day , a group must cover a wide range of habitats , arriving at each at the optimum time of day . Dr. James Tucker , founder and executive director of the ABA , and the leader of a party that set the current American record of 229 species , explains that " it takes years to build up a good route and a precise schedule . On the day we set the record April 28 , 1973 , we started out at 3:45 A.M. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it turned out to be the only one we saw all day . From there we went to some woods east of town for night birds , moved north to Lake Houston , then down to the mud flats at Galveston and along the coast to Rockport , picking up birds we had spotted the week before . We had a flat tire in Rockport , and we asked the attendant if he could plug a tire while it was still on . He said he could , put the plug in , sawed it off , and we got away in less thanfive minutes . From Rockport we went on to Corpus Christi , south through the King Ranch , where we got some desert birds , then finally wound up in the Rio Grande Valley where we picked up several Mexican birds , and at 9:30 that night we ended with the barn owl . We had driven 551 miles in eighteen hours of solid , nonstop birding . We even did all our eating in the car while we were driving . It takes that kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Even the most fanatical birders seldom attempt more than one or two of the rigorous Big Day runs a year , but Tucker , whose indefatigability is legend among his colleagues , has devised an even more killing form of competition : " A marathon is a number of Big Days back to back . I did them for several years in a row , but the last one in 1971 cured me . On five successive days we birded the Valley , the Rockport area , Houston , Austin , and finally wound up in Big Bend National Park in far West Texas , where we backpacked into the mountains . That night , after five days of all-out birding with no more than two or three hours ' sleep a night , I was totally exhausted . Then , at 2:00 A.m. , one of the other two guys had a kidney-stone attack . I hiked down the mountain with a flashlight and walked four miles to the nearest telephone and called a ranger . He and I walked back up and carried the guy down on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we drove 100 miles to the nearest hospital , and I drove on home to Austin , another 500 miles . It was the most grueling , exhausting experience I have ever had . That cured me . " One suspects , however , Tucker has experienced not a cure but a temporary remission ; in the next breath he revealed plans for an even more demanding exploit . Though he swore me to secrecy , I am permitted to reveal that " it would be great ! It would be unprecedented ! " TUCKER 'S BIG DAY notwithstanding , the big-CI gest birding story of 1973 was the race between Kenn Kaufman and Floyd Murdoch to beat the American Big Year record of 626 species , set by Ted Parker in 1971 . Parker himself had asserted that one could probably see at least 665 species in one year in the AOU checklist area . Members of the birding fraternity all over the country avidly followed the Kaufman-Murdoch contest , not only because of the intrinsic interest in seeing a record broken , but also because of the striking differences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short-haired college instructor from Tennessee , with ample resources to finance a Big Year run . Kaufman is a bearded , longhaired Kansas high-school dropout with no money . While Murdoch drove and flew about the country in comparative comfort , Kaufman hitchhiked 80,000 miles and kept his total expenses for the year under $1,000 , which he raised by borrowing , cashing in life insurance , working briefly as a fruit picker , and selling blood plasma . He gained basic nourishment by eating Friskies and other pet foods ? " People laugh at that , but it 's like laughing at Washington 's troops going barefoot in the snow " and sped himself along by drinking deeply of the bottomless cups of coffee available at twenty-four-hour restaurants . He was mugged , jailed for hitchhiking , and , while birding with Murdoch , trapped in a fierce storm in the Tortugas . Kaufman slept outdoors in sub-zero weather in Alaska , protecting himself from the cold by crawling in holes in the rocks and pulling his pack in on top of himself like a trap-door spider . Finally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he was swept off a jetty by a huge wave and came dangerously close to drowning . Because of recent changes in the AOU checklist and slight differences in the areas allowable under AOU and ABA rules , the contest ended in perhaps as satisfying a denouement as possible . According to the ABA list , Murdoch was the winner with 670 species to Kaufman 's 666 , but the AOU area includes Baja California , where Kaufman found five species to run his AOU total to 671 . Both Murdoch and Kaufman can , therefore , claim with some legitimacy to be the new American champion . Although both men approached their Big Year in the spirit of " anything worth doing is worth doing to excess , " they admit they were pretty well burned out by October but kept going primarily because of the vicarious enjoyment others were getting from their struggle . Neither seems interested in repeating the feat ; Murdoch flatly states he will never work on a big list again . Still , he notes that Peter Alden 's single-year record of over 2,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he were interested in another Big Year . As part of its attempt to gain recognition for birding as a legitimate sport , the ABA has established rules for the various types of competition . The basic rule is that , to be counted , a bird must be " wild and unrestrained " ; one can not pad one 's list by making a tour through the birdhouse at the local zoo . Other rules govern territory and the conduct of specific types of competition . For example , a bird seen on the Mexican side of the Rio Grande can not be counted unless it flies across into U.S. territory while being watched . A Big Day team should contain no more than six members , who must ride in a single vehicle and remain within conversational distance of one another . Such rules , of course , are virtually impossible to enforce . " This is a real problem , " Tucker admits . " There is no way to be absolutely sure . We have to rely on a kind of fraternal agreement that people will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person claims he has seen rare birds but can never show them to anybody else , or if he can not demonstrate his expertise when in the company of people of known quality , he gets a reputation pretty fast for not really having seen the birds he claims . " Ben Feltner agreed : " There is no way to certify birding records , but you earn a reputation pretty soon . Either you are doing it or you are not doing it , and people seem to know . " This uncertainty vexes Noel Pettingell , a Houston postal worker who ranks as one of the purists of the pure , but it has not discouraged him . Pettingell is a man obsessed with records of all sorts , a man whose ultimate desire is to see " Girding " ensconced between " Billiards " and " Bobsledding " in the Guinness Book of World Records . He is the unofficial statistician for the ABA and publishes an occasional summary of birding records called The Pettingell Report . He keeps track not only of new marks in the major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ photographed in North America ( 650 ) , most species seen in the smallest area in a single day ( 112 , sighted in 100 square feet ) , and most species seen from , as distinguished from in , one 's own backyard ( 92 ) . Pettingell admits he is a compulsive lister , but he defends his records with philosophical seriousness . " Just as bowlers and golfers use their scorecards as a measure of ability in their respective sports , " he said , " having one 's list totals published gives a birder a sense of individual satisfaction , importance , and accomplishment as a competitor in a unique sporting activity that he or she may be unable to achieve in any other aspect of his or her life . " Giving the bird D ESPITE ITS VITALITY , the ABA and its philosophy are not without detractors . Among them is Dr. Sidney Gauthreaux , an ornithologist in Clemson University 's Department of Zoology . " I love birds for the mystery , " he said . " I am trying to gain a basic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through birds . I started off as a lister , but I gave it up when I got more concerned with finding things to add to my list than with finding answers to questions about birds . I resent people who make lists of how many birds they have seen between the office and the barbershop or how many they have seen on a wire . I actually knew a guy with a wire list . Before long , he will probably have a list called Birds Hovering Near Wires . ' " Resentment toward listers is perhaps nowhere stronger than in England , where they are known as twitchers for their habit of " twitching off " to see a bird . According to James Wolstencroft , a student who spent the first half of 1974 birding in America before entering Cambridge in the fall , most twitchers are " young people from London who wear their hair tied back in hippie headbands and walk around in bare feet . There is great antipathy between the pro- and antitwitehing factions . Some traditionalists would n't go twenty miles to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twitchers . The typical British birdwatcher , unlike the ABA people , would never publish in a magazine that he belongs to the 600 Club . We are just not on to that kind of thing . Some people think that if you even know your life list , you are not really a birdwatcher but more of a stamp collector or train spotter , or something like that . " Wolstencroft , who classifies himself as a cross between the traditional birdwatcher and the twitcher , admires the zeal of the latter but concedes the traditionalists have a legitimate complaint . " Seeing a new bird is so important to these twitchers that they sometimes charge across fields and destroy them , so that in some places the farmers have signs up that say ' NO BIRD WATCHERS , ' BIRDWATCHERS NOT WELCOME , ' GO HOME . BIRDWATCHERS ' ? that sort of thing . And the wardens at the reserves hate them because some of them will do anything to see a bird , and that can become an ecological threat . Take the Swainson 's Warbler , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Every year it is driven out of its optimum territory by birders with tape recordings of the Swainson 's song . These people want to draw the bird out , but the birds hear all these other males who are singing so much and they move further hack into the swamp , which is not the best habitat for them . The optimum habitat in that region is held by tape recorders . " The division of birders into listers and nonlisters or traditionalists and twitchers is , of course , too simple . The lure of the list may lead some to slight aesthetics and ornithological science in favor of raw competition , but to become a competent lister one must accumulate an enormous amount of information about birds ? what kinds appear where and when ; how to find them when they are there ; how to recognize them at rest , in flight , or by their calls ; and how to distinguish them from birds whose only difference may be a slightly longer bill or a white eye ring or three tiny bars on the tail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in birds would go to the trouble to master such details simply for the sake of a game . In fact , a dedicated lister may have little interest in matching his list against that of anyone else . Arlie McKay , who is Noel Pettingell 's only Texas peer at keeping meticulous records and who has spent much of the last seventy-six years looking at birds , has shown a remarkable lack of concern for competition . " That is just not my hobby , " he explained . " My hobby is to keep a list for what has come to be known as the Cove area , the part of Chambers County west of the Trinity River . I commenced to keep records on September 5 , 1934 . Since then I have kept a daily record of every bird I have seen for forty years . " McKay means every bird , every day . At regular intervals , he has summarized his records and transferred them onto a 1938 election tabulation form that he converted for the purpose . The master list stops in 1970 because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had foreseen this and had picked up two of the poll lists , but " it takes a good bit of work to set one up , and I kept postponing it until it got to be too big a problem . Now my eyesight is so bad I probably never will fill it out . " But just in case , he still faithfully records every bird he sees . " I have to . If I did n't write it down , I might not remember when I saw it and I could n't fill it in on my big sheet . If you know why people collect stamps or things like that , why , you will understand . " EW SERIOUS BIRDERS are as concerned with competition as Jim Tucker and Noel Pettingel ! or as unconcerned with the bird life beyond walking distance from their homes as Arlie McKay , but they hold a great deal in common . They have no secret handshakes , yet their sense of fraternity is real enough . Few things seem to please them more than sharing a bird with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all over the world who are willing to serve as unpaid guides for visiting birders . A new bird in town quickly becomes the subject of extensive telephone conversation , complete with details on how to find it that are accurate to a degree astounding to the neophyte who imagined the birds themselves had only the roughest notion as to how they would spend their day . When birders meet , they say things like , " I think this is the first time I 've seen you since we got Ross 's Goose at the Anahuac Refuge . No , I take that back . It was when we saw the last of the Brown Pelicans off Galveston . " Among Texas birders , the surest sign that one has been fully accepted into the inner circles is the taking of a bird name . Not a joke name like the Bleary-eyed Bald Ego or the Garbled Nitwit , but the name of an actual bird , assigned because of some real or imagined connection with its owner . Ben Feltner , for example , is the Blue Jay because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hooded Warbler because of his slight size and high metabolism . Noel Pettingell 's repetitiveness has earned him the title of Whippoorwill . This practice was begun by Edgar Kincaid , an eccentric scholar who roosts in the basement of the University of Texas Press , where he has finally completed the thirteen-year task of updating and editing Harry Church Oberholzer 's 3.2-million-word manuscript for The Bird Life of Texas . Kincaid is a confirmed misanthrope who would prefer a world that resembled Aristophanes ' Cloud-cuckoo-land , a utopia of , by , and for the birds . In such a world , his choice for Secretary of Law and Order would undoubtedly be his own namesake , the Great Cassowary . " Humans have killed off birds by the millions , even billions , either for food or just by poisoning them . That is all so one-sided . The cassowary has three toes , and the middle one is long and sharp like a dagger . In Australia some of the natives try to keep the birds as pets , and sometimes , if they get too familiar , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharp claws and rip open their bellies , and their intestines just plop out on the ground . It still does n't even the score , but the cassowary at least gets back in a small way for the horrible crimes people have committed against birds . " Given his hostility to Homo sapiens , Kincaid 's decision to bestow a bird name on an acquaintance ranks as a great compliment . " Birds are the highest form of life , " he insisted . " They are the most alive . The normal temperature of a hummingbird or a swift is 108 . If it gets excited , it runs up to 109 or 110 . That 's really living . Also , birds are just the right distance away from people , biologically . Monkeys , or even dogs or cats , are too close to us humans , with all our Watergates and our monstrous crimes . And even though it is growing and all that . you ca n't really have any rapport with a plant . But birds are just right . " a FTER TAGGING @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apprentice birding in the Yucatan , I managed to convince my friends that my interest was sincere , and wangled an invitation to attend the annual meeting of the Texas Ornithological Society , in Beaumont . Finally , I would get a good long look at birders in their natural habitat . We gathered early in the morning at a local motel whose manager said he had seldom been host to a less raucous group of conventioneers . As we stood around squinting into the morning sun , I observed that most birders are not obsessed with style . In general ? there were , of course , notable exceptions ? their appearance ran to " sensible . " The women wore rubber boots , blue sneakers with green socks , brown oxfords with thin white socks , shapeless jeans , forgettable shirts , and caps or large straw hats . Hairstyles were plain , with a preference among older women for the shingled look that goes with the watch turned to the inside of the wrist . The men seemed to favor khaki trousers and plaid shirts or jump suits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jump suits , tan jump suits , all with pockets large enough to hold Roger Tory Peterson 's Field Guide to the Birds of Texas . Most wore caps , but left the bills flat rather than shape them the way a baseball player would . Still , they displayed an odd sort of athleticism . They were hardy men , built for the long haul . They did not walk with the smooth gait of men who played conventional sports as youths , but they looked as if they could walk forever . On the first two mornings , we visited swamps and mud flats in search of shorebirds . When the group split into two sections and one contingent piled straightway into the water , I fastened myself to Sidney Gauthreaux , who headed for higher ground with the observation that he regarded it a matter of skill to see what he could find without getting wet . Gauthreaux was an ideal companion . A natural teacher who takes time to explain things to the intelligently ignorant , he was not above turning aside from the path to avoid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people with too many bird-club patches on their clothes , " he cautioned , " especially when they wear them on their caps . " He also introduced me to the joys and ploys of birdmanship . At a crude level , birdmanship may amount to nothing more than wandering off from a group and claiming to have sighted a rare bird while the others looked at starlings and grackles . More sophisticated and gutsy birders sometimes make confident assertions unlikely to be challenged , such as distinguishing between the sounds of finches flying overhead at night or , at the sight of a flock of several virtually identical shorebirds , calling attention to ? the Dunlin about a third of the way from the front . " In the afternoon we went to Smith Woods , a Small patch of trees at High Island , about thirty-five miles east of Galveston . The TOS meetings had been timed to coincide with the spring migration , a six-week period during which millions of birds migrate from as far south as South America all the way to the Middle Atlantic states and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patches of greenery the birds see as they fly in from over the gulf ; though most fly farther inland , a small proportion ? perhaps one-tenth of 1 percent ? will stop there , making High Island an excellent hirding location . On days when the migrants have encountered rain or strong wind resistance offshore , a much higher percentage drop into the woodlands exhausted , to rest and bathe in several small ponds before continuing the journey north . Until they start to drop , the birds can not be seen flying overhead , even with the aid of binoculars , because they fly at heights in excess of a mile . Professor Gauthreaux , a leading expert on transgulf migration , has demonstrated that wind currents are a major factor in the distribution of small birds , and that they fly at such heights because that is where they find the wind currents that will take them where they want to go . " Over the eons that warblers have been migrating , " he observes , " they have been taking the path of least resistance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and have to fly more than 2,000 miles , why buck the wind ? " From time to time , Gauthreaux would peer into the sky with his binoculars , then single out a tiny dot plunging to earth like a black hailstone . " It 's a catbird , and it 's going to come in close to us . " A few moments later , the dot would become a bird , and , as it braked itself and landed in a nearby tree , the bird would become a catbird . I have finally learned to distinguish the silhouettes of a number of flying birds , but I seriously doubt I shall ever be able to determine the difference between the dot of a catbird and the dot of an Indigo Bunting at 3.000 feet . The final day was to have been the most . exciting and would , I was certain , serve as the central focus for my story . Victor Emanuel and Noel Pettingell had assembled a team whose other members were Fred Collins , Dan Hardy . and Elric McHenry , and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the high winds that met us at 5:30 Sunday morning made it clear we did not have a chance . We saw some fine birds , and Noel almost broke his one-day woodpecker record , but we fell fifty species short of the mark Tucker 's party had set . We played out the string , but , with the record out of reach , discipline broke down and a giddy exhaustion set in . As we headed back to Houston my companions turned from talking about what might have been to what yet may be . Some day , they reckoned . the major Christmas Counts would vie for the services of highly paid professionals , and perhaps a team that finished last in one year 's count could draft a Kenn Kaufman or a Floyd Murdoch to help them the next year . More militant birders would become angry when sportswriters called them by their given names instead of the White-winged Dove or The Common Potoo . Eventually , a special television channel would be dedicated solely to birding . " When someone reported a bird , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a tape would come up , presenting a life history of the bird , with all the details about previous sightings . By this time , a mobile crew would get to the site and interview people who had seen the bird . Then the bird itself would be shown live on the screen . " And , " Noel exulted , " we could set up a category of people who had seen the most species of birds on their TV screen without leaving their armchairs . Would n't that be tremendous ? "
