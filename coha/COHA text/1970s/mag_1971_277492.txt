Very Much Alive <P> Sir : Who said God is dead and the Catholic Church is archaic and unprogressive ? He and it are very much alive in every fiber of Dan and Phil Berrigan Jan. 25 - in their courageous mad struggle for some kind of human decency ! <P> ANNE T. PETRO <P> Northfield , Ohio <P> Sir : It is my feeling that the Berrigans are bogus on two counts . They claim to represent Christ , but in their insurrection they behave contrary to his teaching and example . They claim to be proponents of peace , but their conduct is riotous . They are hypocrites . <P> ROY A. DAVISON <P> Roeselare , Belgium <P> Sir : Hearty congratulations on a brilliant article on the Berrigans . Having been a member of the cast in the premiere presentation of Daniel 's The Trial of the Catonsville Nine at the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles , I was one of many actors who finally found a " prophet . " Daniel was still underground at the time of the presentation last summer , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was perhaps ridiculous , if not downright unbelievable . <P> PETER STRAUSS <P> Los Angeles <P> Sir : To call the Berrigans prophets is a tragic copout . No extraordinary seers or saints , they are simply men who put us all to shame by their very human example of realistic courage , imagination and faith . <P> With no new knowledge or visions , they act out what every Christian could and should bs doing . <P> ( MRS . ) CAROLYN L. WHITTLE <P> Newtonville , Mass . <P> Sir : Shall we again , once again kill our prophets-and leave it to our children to decorate their tombs ? <P> Let us , for once , just this once-hear me now-just this once , let us try decorating before we bury . <P> JOSEPH F.X . CONTE <P> Bergen , Norway <P> Sir : One day , not too far off , Philip Berrigan should be President of the United States . Here for once is a man who could be trusted with power , who has proved through his life that he has integrity of character and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your abysmal political mess , which makes millions of people unhappy and insecure . <P> And for good measure . Daniel Berrigan should be the next Pope . Amen . <P> ADDA RADUNZ <P> Vancouver , B.C. <P> Sir : " Christlike " - nuts ! Thirteen pieces of silver to the Berrigans and Sister Lizzie . <P> ( MRS . ) MILDRED TULLY <P> Park Ridge , Ill . <P> Sir : From your article on these curious priests , I got the impression that you doubt their ability to do violence . <P> As I remember the draft board assaults , these men and their accomplices did do violence . They terrorized the personnel , committed arson , tore up property , poured blood around , and generally acted like hoodlums and vandals . I hold that violence , like virginity and pregnancy , is not subject to degree . <P> G. MANNING MEACHAM <P> Chattanooga , Tenn . <P> Sir : It seems that when Good Pope John XXIII opened the windows of the Catholic Church to let in fresh air , some of its clergy jumped out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> RAYMOND M. ROBICHAUD <P> Laconia , N.H. <P> <P> Baser Appetites <P> Sir : Thank you for your article entitled " The Shame of the Prisons " Jan. 18.
