txt Hippies in ragged clothes sit by its side on bedrolls and backpacks or camp on its curves in dilapidated cars with the doors hanging open . The middle class drives by unstopping , sealed off in their Bodies by Fisher , their stereotape decks throbbing to the rising pulse of Ravel 's Bolero . Highway 1 from Morro Bay to Monterey . Its way is crooked , twining , twisted and narrow , a ribbon of highway with socioeconomic kinks and raggedly loose human ends , A road everybody drives once with weary arms and rarely has time to drive again . A road once a scenic spectacular of the touring class and now a " hippie highway , " full of casualties from the generation gap . The thumb at the end of the outstretched arm is the hallmark of the highway . It juts stiff-jointed into the northbound motorist 's line of vision first a hundred miles south , from the grass alongside the road where Santa Barbara abuts U.S. 101 , where in the midmorning sun a hitchhiker 's national convention seems about to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hall the open road ; their platform : a ride for every delegate . Their placards are hand scribbled cardboard signs , a forestof them , calling out destinations . Laconic explanations , to the point : " Frisco , " " S.F. , " " Big Sur , " or life stories : " I 'm in love and she 's in San Francisco . " Land collides It is not long out of Morro Bay before the land begins to exert its personality , shouldering out all other considerations . The land does n't meet the sea , it collides with it . It is a great brown and green and gray fogbound Brigadoon , tumbling down out of the mist , humpingand arching abruptly to the sea as if it ca n't wait to reach the water . And there it scatters whole little islands of rock onto the continental shelf . The sea pounds back violently , breaking against the land , spraying , protesting , eroding , gouging out strange forms in the sea cliffs . And on the edge of the humping land the highway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all a curious blend of beauty and violence . // *A middle-class drive through generation gap // Suddenly , at the curve , the hippie encampment . Ragged figures , waving signs in the windshields of the passing middle class , which slows , then speeds up and roars past . The signs say , " spare food ? " " Spare smokes ? " Alms asking at 40 m.p.h . Grapes of wrath on the slopes of Brigadoon . Ten miles up the highway , Becky sat by the row of mailboxes in Gorda and said , " You do n't wanta have nothing to do with ' at gang down the road . It 's good you did n't stop . They are a bad bunch . Two rapes down there the other day , and they set a fire that burned off all the mountains around here except this one . " City hippies ' Becky is a child of the highway . She got her elementary education in the one-room schoolhouse up from the highway and was bused the 40 miles south to Cambria for high school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by . Wants to go on to college next year . " Those people down the road , " she says , " they are just city hippies who do n't know what they are doing . They just sit there begging food and smokes . They do n't know how to camp or how to build a proper campfire . We had a forest ranger here before the force was cut back who taught them some things and sorts looked out for them , but now he 's goine and there they are . " Only other trouble we generally have are the arguments when members of the school board meets . They almost came to blows at the meeting last week . " Becky continued to sit and watch as the bodies-by-fisher set revved on by , past Big Sur into the spotless middle-class enclaves at Carmel and Monterey , the more comfortable miles , with the spotless shopping malls and clean-swept , tree-clustered inns . On they drive toward San Francisco far beyond the violent grandeur of Highway 1 , turning to nod as they pass , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Ft .
