this hour . She has been through a heavy strain and needs the rest . " " Lady of the house ! " snorted the irate Lavira . " Who 's that ? You do n't mean that conceited Janet with her queer Scotch lingo , do you ? Because if you do I 'd have you to know that no person like that can keep me out . I belong to the family ! " " Yes , madam , that may be so , but you see I have my orders , and I am not able to go beyond them . " " Why , you unspeakable outrageous fool ! The very idea of your daring to keep me out of this house ! I insist that you take my name up to Eden or whoever she has put in charge of the house . If you do n't do so I 'll push by you and go right upstairs to her room myself . I simply wo n't be treated this way , when I 've only come to be of service here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You go at once ! " " No , madam . I have been told not to disturb Miss Eden on any account . Perhaps you do not know , madam , that there has been a death in the household , which has made it very hard for everybody , and we are doing all we can to give Miss Eden a chance to rest . In fact her father , Mr. Thurston , asked me a few hours before he died to especially guard her from all intruders these first few days after he was gone , for he knew they would be more than hard for her . " " But this is ridiculous ! " spluttered the woman . " I shall appeal to the authorities ! " Then suddenly Mike stepped into the picture. " just what is it you wanted to appeal to the authorities for , madam ? I belong to the police force and I have been asked to look after the comfort of this house . Suppose you come with me and we can talk it over . " Mike was enveloped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ startled the woman that she fairly gasped . " Oh ! A policeman ! " she ejaculated . " Why , what has happened ? Are things in such bad shape here that they have to be guarded by a policeman ? " she questioned , yielding to the firm pressure on her arm and the authority of the law , as she backed down the steps and was propelled down the front walk and out to the street . " Why yes , madam , " Mike said in a well-guarded whisper . " Last night after they had all retired and the house was carefullylocked , somebody broke into the library and went through the late Mr. Thurston 's desk , and all his private papers ! " 4 The announcement was made solemnly and filled the woman with awe . ' " How  --  how perfectly terrible ! " she exclaimed . " Of courseI did n't know about that . No wonder they were all so upset . But you see I 'm one of the family , and came here to help . I ought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand of the law was still firmly upon her arm , and she did not go back . In fact the alarm that this big Mike had suddenly raised within her was on the increase . She felt she should learn more about this supposed robbery that the man said had been going on . She must find out if her son had been caught in any such mistaken escapade . It would not be beyond his powers to try something like that , she knew . And it was all right of course if he found such measures necessary to carry out his plans . He and she had hoped to be able to work quietly from inside the house as members of the family . But anything was all right if he could get away with it , and hitherto he had always got away with it . Still it was ratherp22frightening to think that there was a possibility that this time he might not get away with it . She looked up pleadingly to Mike 's stern face , with slippery unmotherly eyes . " I really ought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why I did n't come . " Mike looked down at her with his wise penetrating eyes . " What did you say your name was , madam ? " " Fane , " said Lavira eagerly . " I 'm Mrs. Lavira Fane . And I got word  --  that is , I had the notice of the death , and I started right away to come , for I knew the dear departed man would have expected me to be here at once . I took the first plane and came right out here as quick as I could . " " You say your name is Fane ? I see . " He took out his notebookand flipped over the leaves with one hand . " Pane . Yes , Fane . Have you any relatives in the city or near by , by the name of Fane ? " A quick wary look came into the woman 's eyes as she met the stern gaze of the big policeman . " Relatives ? Oh no , none by the name of Fane . That is , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Thurstons . You see my name is really Thurston . I was a widow with one son and I married a brother of the deceased , Mr. Thurston , so my name really is Thurston , and I certainly ought to go right back and be with Eden . It is my duty , you know . " But Mike McGregor walked steadily on , with his grasp still firm on the woman 's arm , and suddenly he looked down into her shrinking frightened eyes . " Your son 's name is Ellery ? " he asked , quite casually , and pierced her through with those eyes that did not flinch . " Why yes , " she simpered , trying to hide her astonishment ,  |p23you  used to know him when he was here before ? He was only a child then . I never heard him speak of you . He 'll be here in a day or two , I guess . He had some business mattersto settle up before he left the West , but he 'll be coming on soon . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calmly . " He must have arrived sometime yesterday , or perhaps earlier , but he is here now . " Lavira gave him a frightened glance , and he could see that her lip was trembling . " But how would you know that ? " she asked , trying toappear casual . " Where is he ? I want to see him at once ! " Mike paused beside a big red police car and opened the door . " Get in , " he said coldly , " I will take you to him . " Lavira turned toward the car and suddenly caught herbreath , stepped back a pace and looked the bright red car over . " But I ca n't get into that car , " she said haughtily . " Why not ? " asked Mike sharply . " But a bright red car like that ! It looks like a police car ! " " It is a police car . Get in ! " " But I ca n't ride in a car like that ! I never was in a police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ride in that . I would be ashamed all the rest of my life . I could n't get over it . " " People have been ashamed all their lives for less than that , " said the policeman grimly . " Get in ! " " Oh , no , no , no ! " said Lavira . " I simply could n't do that ! Tell me where you think my son is , and I 'll get a taxi and go there , but I ca n't go in a police car ! " " Sorry , " said Mike , " if you want to go to your son you 'll have to go with me in this car . This is my car , and I 'm taking you . Get in ! " There was that in Mike 's voice that made the woman knowp24she must obey . Slowly she turned and got in , forcibly assisted by Mike 's big insistent hand . " But , but , where am I going ? I ca n't do a thing like this without knowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the police station , madam , " said Mike . " Your son is there . You wanted to see him . That 's where he is . " " Oh ! " she gasped , " but what is he doing there ? " " He 's being questioned for breaking into the Thurston house last night and ransacking Mr. Thurston 's desk drawers . " " Oh , he did n't do that , " pleaded the mother . " I know he did n't . He would n't do a thing like that . Besides he was n't here last night . He was to come in on the afternoon train and meet me here . We had planned to come right on and take care of Eden . We knew she would be so lonesome ! " But McGregor rode on in silence , not even noticing by so much as the lift of an eyelash , the flow of words by his side , and the freely flowing tears which he told himself grimly were only crocodile tears . For McGregor knew his crooks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that Lavira was ushered into police headquarters , where she was greeted by the sight of her misguided son sitting in one corner of the room , in close confab with two stern-looking policemen . He sat there before his inquisitors filled with assurance , his one long wavy lock of hair hanging gaily over his handsome dejected face , like a banner , to which he occasionally gave a careless toss , but his mouth was grim and sullen as he tried to explain to the police how it came about that his fingerprints were on the window that had been jimmied open in the Thurston house , and what he was looking for in the Thurston desk drawers ; also how it was that he came to have several old cancelled checks in his pocketp25that bore Mr. Thurston 's signature , and what he had been planning to do with them . His excuse for the latter was that he wanted the checks for souvenirs of his beloved dead uncle did not seem to go down with the police , as they knew well by now that Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , back at the Thurston house , Eden lay in her own quiet room , getting a much-needed rest . All that day she was watched over by her faithful servitors , careful that nothing should disturb her . And then next morning , all too early for the careful plans ' to guard her , it was the telephone by her bed that roused her from her long refreshing sleep . Chapter Three1ELLO , Beautiful ! How are you ? " breezed a voice out of the past . " How are you fixed for the day ? Ready to run off for a few hours and have a jolly time ? I 'm here on leave for the day , and I want to make the most of it if it 's okay with you . " Eden was silent for a minute or two , blinking at the instrument in startled bewilderment , unable for an instant to identify the voice , it seemed so much more mature than when she last heard it . Then it came to her . He would be older of course than when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was it more ? " Oh ! " she exclaimed in amazement . " Why , it 's Caspar Carvel , is n't it ? But I thought you were away in the Philippinessomewhere , or even in Japan . How grand to knowp26you 're home . How did you get here without letting us know And where have you been all this time ? " " Oh , here and there , " said the laughing voice . " But you never wrote to us but once ! " reproached Eden , " Well , I know , I never was much of a correspondent , you know . Besides they kept us awfully busy in the army . I just did n't have time . But anyhow , I 'm here now , and I have t leave tonight . I 'm due up in New York to do some broad casting , and I ca n't tell when I can get back , so I thought I 'd call you up . How about it ? Can you give me the day , and perhaps part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nice dump for dinner and a dance ? Will you go ? You know it 's a long time since we went gadding together , old girl , and I do n't want to waste any time . Hurry up and say yes . I have n't got another nickel handy and I want to get this settled . I 'll come for you in three quarters of an hour . And make it snappy . Can you be ready in that time ? Wear somethingpretty smart . I may want to introduce you to a coupla the fellows if we happen to meet them . This all okay ? " Eden caught her breath . Could this really be Caspar Carvel ? He did n't sound in the least like her old friend and playmate . The handsome boy who had been her playmate in high school , and who had been almost daily running in and out of their house . She hesitated , and the voice on the other end of the wire grew impatient : " I say ! Are you there , Eden ! Did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I have n't got another nickel handy . " " But  --  are you really Caspar Carvel ? Somehow your voice sounds so different ! I did n't recognize it at first . You seem so grown-up ! " There was a little sad reproach in her tone . " Well , good night ! One does grow up , you know . And Ip27guess there 's no place to accomplish that quicker than in the army Do you mind ? " There was a sharp challenge to his tone now . Eden still hesitated . " Why , no , of course not , " she said , trying to speak naturally . " It 's quite to be expected of course . But somehow you startled ' Mc . I was n't expecting you . " " Well , are you coming with me ? Get a hustle on . I only have this day and I want to make the most of it . " " Why , Caspar , I want to see you of course , but I could n't go with you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What ? You mean go dancing ? You mean your dad would object to that ? But surely he does n't attempt to lord it over you the way he used to . You 're of age , are n't you ? Or almost . I should think you had a right to do what you want to now . But anyway , if you think he would kick up a row we could steal away to some place he would n't know about . Would he really make a fuss now ? It 's time you made a stand against such petty domineering . If you 're afraid of him I 'll tell him what I think of him . Just wait till I get out there . " Eden 's voice was choked with sudden tears . " My father is not here , Caspar . " " Well , then , what 's the matter ? He need n't know where you went . Where is he ? Will he be away all the evening ? " Eden took a deep breath and choked back the tears . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His funeral was day before yesterday . " There was deep sorrow in the girl 's voice , and Caspar 's gay tone suddenly hushed . " Oh ! " he said , aghast . " Oh , you do n't mean it ! You see I did n't know it . I ask your pardon for barging in this way . I 'm sorry ! Was he sick for long ? Somebody ought to have told me But I really have n't seen anybody from over this wayp28in a long time . I hope you 'll understand . Of course I do n't suppose you feel like making gay right away . I understand . Perhaps you 'd rather I did n't come over today . " " Oh , no , I 'd like to see you , " said Eden gravely . " I have been wondering what had become of you . Nobody seemed to know . " " Okay , I 'll be over for a little while . By-by ! " Eden dropped back on her pillows and lay there staring up at the ceiling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strangely different he seemed . Even after she had told him of her father 's death his voice was hard and unsympathetic . The words were all right , but he sounded as if he were in a world that was not hers . Of course that was what people were saying war did to the boys , though some that she knew had come home quite changed in another way , more reliable , more gentle and sometimes grave . Well , but this was n't fair to Caspar . Judging him before she had really seen him at all . It would be natural that one would change to some degree when taken out of a home environment and put among a lot of tough fellows . Although of course they were not all tough . Well , she would put such thoughts aside and try to wait until he came , and then perhapsshe would n't feel he was changed so much after all . But as she rose and went about the matter of dressing , the brief conversation over the telephone kept lingering in her mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so disrespectfully , suggesting that she get out from under his care . How terrible for him to speak that way ! Why , he used always to admire her father , to look up to him ! And her father had always been so nice and kind to Caspar . Had he forgotten all that ? Did n't he remember how her father had gone with him to see the man at the apartment house after he brokep29two of their windows in the basement , and paid for the windows , and then let Caspar pay him five cents a week out of his allowance until it was all paid for ? And Caspar had been so pleased , and had understood why dad did n't pay it himself , because it would n't be good for Caspar to get away without paying for his own carelessness . Caspar used to be such an understanding boy . Oh , he could n't have changed that way . He used to come to dad for help in things instead of going to his own father , because his own father simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a while . Well , anyway , she must n't judge Caspar until she saw him face to face , and talked with him , and found out whether he was really the fine upstanding boy he used to be in the days when she thought he was everything a young man should be . Of course she had been much upset that he had n't written to her as he had promised to do , but she had excused that because she knew Caspar hated to write letters . And gradually she had learned to forget the heartaches that had come at first after he went away , and told herself that she was too young to break her heart because a school boy had forgotten to write letters when he was off fighting battles . And so the days had gone by and the memory of Caspar had gently faded from her Thoughts . And now , suddenly , with the sound of his voice , the whole vision of his handsome vivacious face , his fine flashing eyes , his alluring smile came over her , and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resolutions that she was done with Caspar , she could n't help an excitementthrilling in her veins . Somehow it was great to have her old friend coming back just when she was sad and lonely over the loss of her dear father . She hurried in her dressing to be ready when he should arrive . If he had not much time she must be ready to see him at once , and of course she mustp30hurry down and tell Janet that he was coming and woul. likely stay to lunch . Then right into the midst of her thoughts the telephon rang again . " Hello Eden , this is Cappie again . I 'm sorry as the dickens , but I find I 'll not be able to come this morning . I 've just mct some old friends , and they are determined I shall go to lunch with them . One of them is my old buddie in the army , and he 's going back overseas tonight , so you see I 've simply got to stay with him and see him off . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm not to see you at all . Is that what you mean ? Well , I 'm sorry , but of course it 's all right . " " Oh , no , I did n't mean that , " said the young man amusedly . " You did n't think . I 'd come all this way down from New York just to see you , and then go off without seeing you , did you ? " " It sounded like that , " said Eden with dignity . " Well I always was a bungler when it came to talking . Of course I 'll be around as soon as he leaves . I have n't found out what train he takes yet , but I 'll be seeing you . How about early this evening ? " " But I thought you wanted to go dancing , " she said sweetly . " Do n't let me hinder you . " " Oh , see here now , that 's all off . Of course I would n't expect you to go out having fun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm not that crude . And I certainly do want to see you like the dickens . I 've been thinking about you all the way home . Yes , I 'm all kinds of sorry I had to meet up with this buddie of mine and be hindered in coming directly to you . But you see I kind of felt under obligation to him onp31account of things he did for me when I was wounded . But say , are you going to be in this evening ? " " Why yes , I think I probably shall . Yes , of course , come when it 's convenient to you . I 'll be very glad to see you . " But her tone was cool . " All righty , I 'll be there , and I 'm just crazy to see you . " So with a hasty " So long , " Caspar hung up and Eden went back to her precious letters . The last letters of Mrs. Thurston were written from a hospital . They were full of tender love for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And now Eden could read between the lines , and sense that her mother knew that her health was in danger , and that she might soon be taken away . There were only a few letters left now and her heart was longing to read them all and get to know this mother who had gone from her so long ago that she could not remember anything about her but a vague lovely face , and a gentle touch . Curiously enough the last three letters were filled with a kind of exultant joy in her love for her husband , and an overwhelminglonging that her little girl might grow up to have such a wonderful life as hers had been . And in one letter she said : I have been praying lately that our little Eden when she grows up may find as fine a man as you are , my beloved . I have been praying much about that , and hoping that as she grows up we may be able to teach her that she must take time to be sure about choosing a mate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face , or a man with wonderful manners , or social standing , or riches , or honor , or physical charm . She must wait and be sure before she joins her life with another life . I shall try with all my heart to make her understand what real love is , and that she must not hastilyp32fancy herself in love with somebody who may turn out to be utterly selfish and bring her nothing but sorrow . Oh , I pray that may never be for my little rosebud of a girl . A girl that has such a wonderful father as my beloved , should also have just such a wonderful husband . And now the letters brought a new note , a foreshadowing of change , as if the mother were trying to prepare her dear ones for her going . In the very last letter she said : And if it should be that I may have to leave our baby girl before it is time to make her understand how important it is that she should choose the right companion for life , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her most carefully , warn her , impress upon her that she must go cautiously , and not make too quick decisions . That she must not think of marrying anyone whom she does not love implicitly . And even then , she must not accept a love that is not from a man who is good and right and true . Eden sat for a long time , reading that letter over again , and looking off out of the window , thinking . And then the vision of the handsome boy who had been Caspar Carvel came to her questioningly . Suddenly she realized that when Caspar went away to war she had looked upon him as a man she would eventually fall in love with . Not that he had ever said a word of any such thing to her , or that she had ever put such a thought into logical form even in her own mind , but she had viewed him in her innocent thoughts as a young man who would someday be a friend of whom to be proud . That was how she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brief talk over the telephone , should there be any question in her mind of his suitability as her close friend ? She could n't quite tell , but the very form of his address had seemed crude and over/familiar . And yet that was absurd of course , for they had been very close friends as children , as students in high school , a merry , friendly companionship . Nothing sentimental about it . And he had n't even written her , just a gay little scrap of a letter , mostly jokes couched in army slang . Well , she would have to wait and see what he had become before she let him take even his old informality with her . She could be friendly , yes , but that was all till she knew him well . But having gone so far in the analysis of her old playmate , she had a definite feeling of sadness , a sense of loss . Somethingthat she had taken for granted was gone , something that had belonged to her , that had been of real value . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the letters that had touched her most and read them over again ; as if , were her mother alive , she might have gone to her for advice . What would her mother think of the present Caspar ? That would be something that she might always ask when she had any important question to decide . What would mother say ? It was almost like having come suddenly into the possession again of her own mother . Having read all those letters of hers , she knew pretty well what would be her advice , her decision about a great many questions of the day . And now as she got up from her chair and went and looked out the window at the beauty of the day , she was glad in her heart that Caspar had not come immediately as he had at first suggested , for now she would come to meet him with the wisdom of her dear mother 's judgment upon her . For she had to own to herself that the little talk she had had with her old friend had not reassured her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because she had been close to death , and a thought of the other world had made her morep34critical ? She could not be sure . Of course her heart was sore , and Caspar had revealed a great lack of respect for the father she loved . She had supposed he loved him also , and that failure to show any love had gone far toward opening her eyes to what he might have become . Certainly she could never be very friendly with one who , having once known what her father was , and benefited by much kindness from him , could speak disrespectfully of him , even though he did not know of his recent death . With a sigh she turned away from the window and went back to put her letters into safe keeping , where no prying eyes could ever bring them out and go through them . She did not yet know that someone in the night had tried to do that very thing to other drawers in her father 's desk . So she got out a lovely capacious writing desk of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that had been her mother 's , and carefully packed her letters within , locking it and stowing it away on a wide shelf in her own personal clothespress safely hidden behind a row of hat boxes . And just then she heard the doorbell . Could it be possible that Caspar had come so early ? But no , he had said he had to see that soldier friend of his off on a train . Well , perhaps he went on an earlier train than was first planned . Eden 's heart began to give anxious little uncertain flutters . Would she know just what to say ? How to act ? Had her mother 's letters made her self-conscious ? That was not good . She must have perfect poise and dignity if she were to use right judgment , and she must of course be friendly and kind as an old schoolmate would naturally be . She must be back exactly where they left off when he went away if she were to judge if he had changed , and if for better or for worse.  |p35And  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentle knock . " Miss Eden , " she said in a low voice , " Mr. McGregor is doon the stair . He says there are some important questions he must ask ye and would ye kindly coom doon the stair an ' let him have a few words wi ' ye ? " " McGregor ? " said Eden . " Oh , you mean Mike . About the burglar , I suppose . Why of course I 'll go right down . " So Eden went down to meet the big friendly policeman and the man he had brought along with him . They were sitting stiffly in the little reception room next to the front door , and just in front of the library , as Eden entered wondering , a bit startled by the stranger whom she had never seen before . EDEN looked with shy surprise at the stranger who hadcome with Mike . He did n't look like a policeman . He was dressed in an ordinary business suit . He was young and good-looking , a gentleman , that was entirely obvious even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Thurston . He 's interested in this case of the young man who entered your house last night . He wants to ask you some questions . He 's got a right to ask ' em . He 's a federal agent as well as the lawyer representing your bank , and he 's here at your Mr. Worden 's request to check things over for us . " Eden gave the young man another startled glance . Itp36sounded rather frightening . Federal agent ! Lawyer ! Surely she did n't know anything that a federal agent would want to question her about . But another good look at the clean-cut face , the steady dependable , trustworthy eyes , reassured her . " Yes ? " she answered , watching his eyes keenly , trying to still the frightened beating of her heart . He did n't look dangerous . Then the young man smiled . " Thank you . I 'm sorry to have disturbed you , but it is necessary for me to learn some facts from the head of this house , and I understand you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her a quick glance that sized up her youth quite accurately . Eden answered with a grave smile , and a nod of assent . She hoped her lips were not trembling , so she held to the smile rather determinedly , to keep them steady . " Very well , then can you tell me just who this person is that calls himself Ellery Fane ? Is he related to you ? " " No , he is not , " she said quickly . " He was the son of my uncle 's second wife by her first husband . I know my uncle , my father 's brother , never knew of the boy when he married Mrs. Fane . But he was too kind-hearted to turn the boy out , and soon after that my uncle died . Then my father tried to be kind to Ellery , but he was rather awful . He forged some checks in father 's bank , when father tried to give him a good job . He was a torment as long as he stayed here , and finally he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is the first time I have seen them since Ellery was sixteen . Father took me away with him on a long business trip . When we came back they were gone . I think that is about all I know . " " Thank you , " said the young man , looking up from thep37quick shorthand notes he was taking . " And now , what about last night ? " " I was sitting in the library going over some letters of my mother 's that father had left for me to read , and I looked up and saw Ellery standing by the door . I do n't know how he got in , or when , he just stood there and called me cousin , ' and began to talk to me . He thought I was going over businesspapers and offered to help me . I told him I did n't want any help from him . He said he and his mother were coming to live with me and take care of me , and that he was going to teach me how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl . He was very insulting to my wonderful father . Then the servants appeared , and when the butler said he had sent for the police , Ellery slid out into the hall , got his hat and coat , and vanished . I think that is about all I know . " " Thank you , " said the man . " And now , Mr. McGregor , where is the butler , and the serving-woman , that you said had more to tell ? " " Right here , sir , " responded Tabor , entering immediately , with Janet like a shadow just behind him . Janet slid quietly in and Tabor stood at attention near the door . Tabor told of the night 's invasion , and his calling for the police . He told why Ellery had been at once suspected , and how his fingerprints , taken after he was caught , had correspondedwith those on the library window that had been jimmied open . Eden listened in wonder as the story unfolded , and then as Janet arose stiffly in response to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrival , and Mike 's carrying her away protesting in his police car , she leaned forward and listened amazed . Oh , what had been going on about her while she was asleep !  |p38How  wonderfully her guardians had protected her ! Bright tears flashed into her eyes . But suddenly the stranger turned to her again and asked several direct questions . Just what had been the actions of this Mrs. Fane during her first stay in town that had made Eden dislike her , and how had the matter terminated ? Eden told briefly of her unpleasant and insistent attempts to get a foothold in the house . Then he asked if she knew whether her father had a financial agreement with Mrs. Fane that made her leave ? " Oh , no , I think not ! " she said , very sure of her facts now . " Father did n't believe in bribes . That would have been bribing , would n't it ? No , he simply made me pack up in a hurry one night and we went off to Europe , leaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , father 's friend you know , who has my affairs in charge . And of course Tabor and Janet knew how to get in touch with us . But they would never have told . They were our own family , you know , " and she cast a grateful little flash of a smile at the two old retainersthat was not lost on the lawyer . " Yes , of course , " agreed Mr. Lorrimer , with a quick glance taking in the looks that passed between Eden and her servants , and appreciating the beauty of the sentiment between them all , realizing that on the surface , at least , there was nothing suspicious here . " And now , " said Lorrimer , settling back , his pencil and notebook in hand ready for any item that needed jotting down , " Miss Thurston , I wonder if you can tell me about business matters ? Was there anything valuable in that desk besides what we know about ? Have you a list of what it contained ? " Eden was thoughtful for an instant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think perhaps there was a list . I 'll get it . It 's up in my room in my desk . Father gave it to me after he was first hurt , but I was so worried about him that I 'm afraid I did n't give much heed to it at the time . " " Of course , " said Lorrimer sympathetically . " Couldna I get it for ye , Miss Eden ? " asked Janet , as Eden turned to hurry away . " No thank you , Janet . You would n't know where to find it . I wo n't be long , " and Eden hurried upstairs , while Mike and Tabor conversed in low tones about the way the room had been found that morning , and Janet stood with folded hands and waited . The young lawyer poised his pencil over the notes he had already taken , and seemed to be summing them up and pondering . But Eden was back in a moment with her hands full of neatly folded papers which she handed over to the lawyer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " These are some properties owned by the estate . He kept most of his important papers in the bank , of course . But these are a few securities he was going to explain to me about sellingthem , and so on . " The lawyer took them bunch by bunch , looked over the headings , glanced at them all and noted down something about each one . " I 'll just have these checked over with the list we have at the bank , " he explained to Eden . " That way we can tell if anything has been tampered with , or if there is anything missing . " " Oh , yes , " said Eden , " but I do n't think my father left anythingdown here that would matter . He usually put valuables in the bank . " The lawyer looked at her thoughtfully and then said :  | " It wo n't do any harm to make sure of course . Your father was n't able to get down to his library and make any changes in the contents of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something have been forgotten ? " It came to Eden as she listened that this young man was keen , and did n't take anything for granted . But she answered , 4 still thoughtfully : " Of course it is possible , but I do n't think it likely . Dad sent me downstairs twice to get special papers for him , and had me seal them in envelopes and send them to Mr. Worden at the bank at once . " " Yes ? Well , now I wonder if I could look at that desk , and examine the room that was broken into ? " So they went a solemn little procession into the library , a room literally lined with books . " I wonder , " said the lawyer after he had gone through the drawers and noted down the contents carefully , " whether there is any possibility that there might be a secret compartmentin this desk ? Do you know , Miss Thurston ? Such a place does not usually manifest its presence for a casual glance like this . " " Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying somethinglong ago about a secret compartment but he would n't likely have left anything valuable there , would he ? Or I should think he would have spoken of it . Tabor , did you ever hear about that ? Did you know of a secret drawer ? " " Yes , Miss Eden , I 'm sure there was . I remember he spoke to me about it once when he put some papers away in it . I 'm not just sure where it was but I think in behind some drawer . " " It 's worth looking for , anyway , " said Lorrimer . " Could it be possible that if there is one , that that Fane boy knew of it ? " " Oh , no , sir . I do n't think he would be likely to , " saidp41Tabor . " He was not allowed in this room . I had my orders when he was about . " Then Janet spoke up . " Do n't ye be too sure ! " she said heatedly . " Thet lad was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ locked-up tae keep him oot . I foond him in here once meself , and he was always fussin ' aroond wi ' locks an ' ketches . If there was a secret drawer he 'd find it ! " The lawyer looked at her sharply , and then walked over to the desk , tapping expertly in different parts of the desk , listening for hollow sounds . " Here ! " he said , " let 's try this side , behind this first drawer . Pull it out will you , Tabor . Look ! That drawer is not long enough for the whole depth of the desk . That 's where it would be . Behind the end of the drawer perhaps . These compartmentsare very cleverly hidden . Have you a flashlight , Mike ? " " Yes sir , here ! " and a fine clear light pierced the dark recess behind the drawer . " Yes ! Here ! " said the lawyer . " Pull out the next drawer . The compartment must be behind both of them , or perhaps even three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and at last came to the hidden spring that released the little high narrow door , and showed a generous space , with just a few scattering papers , none of special value , but all of them mussed and looking as if they had been hastily stuffed back for a hurried departure . " " Yes , " said the lawyer thoughtfully . " And here is a thought , perhaps . This place is not in the careful order that seems to have been maintained throughout the rest of the desk , or the room . If we only could be sure what was originally kept inp42this compartment we might be able to check up . Perhaps Mr. Worden may be able to give us some light on this when he gets back . I 'm looking for him to be home tonight or perhapssooner . I 'll ask him at once . By the way , let me feel back into that compartment . I have a hunch that there is still something more in there . I did n't reach all the way to the bottom , did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I thought I did . But there did n't seem to be anything down there . It was all smooth . It almost seemed like it had been varnished . " The lawyer was down on his knees again beside the desk , turning on the flashlight , and examining every inch of the way most carefully . Then his hand went down into the compartmentagain and searched around . He seemed to be lingeringlonger than was necessary just to make sure that there was nothing further there . It almost seemed as if he were struggling with something , and then he reached out one hand . " Get me a screw driver , " he said from under the desk . Tabor gravely produced one and laid it in the reaching hand , and the rest of them stood watching , wondering if he had found anything . A moment more the lawyer worked away out of sight , and then drew back and brought forth a white box , just the length of the lower part of the compartment . Then he rose , dusted off his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desk , the white box still in his hands . " There ! " he said triumphantly . " The box is covered with satin paper and feels like a smooth varnished surface . That 's what fooled us . Could there possibly have been other such boxes in there ? " He looked speculatively at Eden , but her eyes were full of wonder . " I do n't know , " she said , shaking her head . " I do n't remem/ber daddy ever saying anything to me about it . Is n't there some writing on that box ? It looks like it . Yes ! See ! " The lawyer handed her the box and she turned it over and read . For Eden . Your grandmother 's pearls . " Oh , " she said . " And that is my mother 's handwriting ! She must have put this here a long time ago , and then perhaps it was forgotten . " " I mind , " said Janet . " I mind weel when she writ thet , an ' towed it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd thought it was tuk to the bank this lang agone ! Is the pearls in the bit box yet ? " " Open it , will you , Miss Thurston ? This is something we must understand if we 're to go searching for a possible thief . " Eden took the box in trembling hands , untied the white ribbon with which it was bound , and opened the box cautiously . The little audience watched her and the box breathlessly . There was tissue paper folded neatly on the top , and then soft pink cotton , and more tissue paper . And at last she brought to light a double string of fine lovely pearls with a delicate clasp set with tiny diamonds . " Oh ! " said Eden with great awe upon her , and then suddenlythe tears rolled down her face , and she could scarcely hold the box for trembling . The young man leaned over and lifting her hands set them down on the desk , box and all , and Janet stepped up with a delicate handkerchief for Eden . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spite of her shaken emotions . " I 'm sorry I had to be such a baby , " she said , half giggling , " but I 'd just been reading some of my mother 's letters , in this same handwriting , and it sort of broke me up . It was asp44if she had suddenly stepped into this room and given ins these pearls , that must have been her mother 's . " " They were , that , " said Janet in an undertone . " She 'd often spoken tae me of thim , an ' once she showed thim tae me . They is rare pearls . " " It 's quite understandable that you should be broken up a finding them , Miss Thurston , " said the lawyer . " I 'm sorry I had to be the cause , but I 'm glad for your sake that we found them . And now I do n't want to bother you any longer thanis necessary.If you 'll just answer a few more questions we'llbe done . Do you have any idea whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this drawer , and what they were ? Would there be a list anywhere ? " " No , " said Eden , " I would n't know . Perhaps Janet would , and of course the rest might be in the bank if there were other things . " " Yes , " said Janet decidedly . " There was ither bits . A diamondbracelet , a lovely pin wi ' rubies , an ' some rings my leddy couldna wear ony mair since she got so thin they kept slipping off . " " You 're sure of that ? " asked the lawyer , and wrote down carefully every little item Janet could remember . " Of course these may be in the bank . I 'll check that over when Mr. Worden gets back . These things may have been the booty the young man was after . Do you know whether he knew about them ? Could he have known of the secret drawer ? " " I couldna answer thet , " said Janet reverting to her native tongue , " boot I dootna he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him in a room , he 'd get tae the bootum ov it in no time , an ' things would be missin ' and naeboody to accoont fer thim. "  |p45The  lawyer looked up at Mike . " Better get Hiley on the phone at once . Tell him to search the boy before he gets a chance to make away with anything . Search the old lady , too . He may have managed to handsomething over to her . Here 's the list . Tell him to make a thorough job of it , before he gets a chance to hide anything . " Eden listened in wonder . " Did Mrs. Fane know of the existence of this jewelry ? " asked Lorrimer . " I do n't know , " said Eden , and he turned toward Janet . " She might have known , " said the old nurse , " although Mrs. Thurston was thet ill after she coom thet she seldom wore jewels . Still this Fane woman was thet much of a snoop diet somehoo she 'd smell oot a thing an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The lawyer nodded , showing that he was getting a pretty good idea of the Fane woman 's character , and that of her boy also . Eden was sitting by the desk with the fine old pearls drippingthrough her fingers , and the young man as he looked up could not but think how fitting such jewels were to go around a lovely throat like this young girl 's . He gave her an admiring glance and an apologetic smile . " I hope you 'll forgive me , " he said , as he got up to take his departure . " This really was necessary , and I should n't wonder if these pearls would help a lot in solving our problems . It 's been nice to have you and your servants co-operate so well . I thank you . " " Oh , I 'm glad if we helped any , and I 'm grateful to you for finding the pearls , " said Eden . " Perhaps I never would have known about them if this had n't happened . " She smiledp46into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes were . " Well , I 'm glad we could find them , and I 'll find out from Mr. Worden at once how much he knows of the contents of this secret drawer . You know it just may be that this little box fitted so tightly into the bottom of the compartment that it escaped notice when the other things were taken out to go to the bank . " " Yes , of course , " said Eden . " I wish I knew just what those things were , the rest of the valuables . Somehow I never took much interest in them while father was alive , and while I was in college . I just thought of them as some old family relics . But I guess I ought to go down to the bank and look the rest over . Should I do it right away ? " " Do n't worry yourself now . If Mr. Worden has n't returned yet I think I 'll call him on the telephone . This is important , to get hold of the facts in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get any more information I 'll call you . " And so with a smile and a quick friendly clasp of the hand he went away with Mike , and the household settled down to what they hoped was going to be peace and quietness . Eden , standing at the window , watching the young lawyer walk down to the street , thought how very kind his voice was , and how restfully dependable he seemed . Of course she did n't know him at all , but he seemed very nice , and she felt almost comfortable knowing that he was working to protect her interests . Then Janet suddenly appeared on the scene . " Coom ye oat an ' heve yer loonch ! " she commanded . " Ye hed niver a bite o ' breakfast , an ' verra little dinner the night before . We didna want ye to blow awa ' wi ' the first little breath of air . "  | " Oh , " laughed Eden , " I did n't realize I had n't had my breakfast . I was just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't it awful that anybody tried to break in ? Do you ally think it was Ellery , Janet ? " " Think ! " sniffed Janet . " I shud say there 's na doobt aboot t . Little snake in the grass ! I only wish he would be put where e couldna be botherin ' the likes of ye ony mair . An ' tae think of thet old sneak of a mither of his coomin ' aroond sayin ' she was goin ' tae be yer chaperone ! I sure would like tae see her bashed in the face the way Mike talks aboot doin ' tae soom of the criminals . " Eden laughed a merry little ripple of a relieved sigh . " What did she say , Janet ? Did she talk to you ? " " Sure she did , an ' I give her gude-an ' - plenty back agin . Her wi ' her sham tears , and her pretenses ! But noo , coom ye out tae yer loonch . It 's already settin ' on the table , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gets cold . Coom noo an ' I 'll tell ye the rest whilst ye eat . " So Eden went to her lunch and heard the full tale of Lavira Fane 's attempt to get into the house earlier in the day . " And where do you think she went ? " asked Eden , with still a bit of trouble on her brow . " Will she try to come back here tonight do you suppose and plead that she has n't any place to sleep ? " " Na , she 'll nae do thet . Mike said he would see thet she was safely hoosed . " " You  --  do n't mean they 've arrested her , do you , Janet ? " Janet gave a significant shrug to her shoulders . " I canna say what they 've doon wi ' her , but I 'm certain they 'd niver let her run at large . They 've places tae keep people they do n't troost , ye ken . Perfec'ly respectable places , thet is , so tae speak , where they can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there ever was a wumman needed an eye kep ' on her , that Pane wumman 's the one . " " Well , I should n't like to be the cause of her going to jail , " said Eden with a troubled look . " Why not , ef it 's the only place ither folks is safe from her ? But do n't ye fret , dear cheeld . Mike 's a discernin ' mon ef there iver was wan , an ' he can be troosted . An ' besides all this , do n't ye know the law has ways of findin ' oot aboot folks ? He 's loikely , as he says , ' got a line ' on her an ' her crooked son , by this toime . An ' ye see the matter is not in yer wee hands . It 's the law has it the noo , an ' ye ca n't do onythin ' aboot it . " " But maybe I ought to telephone ; alike to get them to promise to go back West where they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Would n't dad have wanted me to do that ? " " No , my leddy , he would niver want thet . He was allus fer joostice . A good business mon is allus fer joostice . And what right would ye have tae send them crooked folk back tae steal frae ither folk ? No , me leddy-gurril , ye 've naethin ' more tae do wi ' it . Just rest yer heart , my lamb . An ' ef ye wanttae talk wi ' onyboody mair aboot the matter , go call yer feyther 's friend , Mr. Worden . Belikes he knows all aboot it by now . Thet yoong lawyer-mon seemed mighty fine an ' oop-coomin ' , He wo n't let the grass grow onder his feet . He 'll get the right kind of advice , an ' stan ' by it . Jest ye rest . " So Eden ate her delicate lunch . " A wee drap o ' soup , " to quote Janet 's description of it , " a cooppla crispy bits o ' toost , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cool little slice o ' pineopple ice , an ' a shred o ' angel cake . Do n't that soond gude , my lamb ? " So Eden began to plan what she would tell Mr. Wordenp49when she called him up . Would he be at the bank now ? And would that Mr. Lorrimer have talked with him yet ? Somehowshe felt that that young man would have a right , just view of things . He would n't be hard on people unless it were necessary , for the safety of others . She would wait a little before calling . Mr. Worden usually went out to lunch at one o'clock . Perhaps she would be able to catch him a little before one . A glance at her watch told her that there was a good half hour yet before she should try to speak with him . Then her thoughts reverted to Caspar . How fortunate that be had changed his plans . If he had come this morning it would certainly have complicated things . Caspar would have been impatient . Would have wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his unpleasant memories of the trouble Ellery had made her father , and would probably have advocated vengeance on the Fanes to the limit . She was glad he was not there . And as for keeping it quiet , keeping Caspar in ignorance of what was going on , that would hardly have been possible . Not with police and lawyers coming to question her , especially when he was wanting to see her without any hindrances to talking . Then she began to look forward to the evening . Would the troubles be settled by that time ? Or would some more policemencome barging in and want more interviews ? She hoped not . Up in her own quiet room again she found it impossible to rest . She tried to call Mr. Worden , but found he had not returned from his business trip , and would probably not be back until the next day some time . There had been a wire from him saying so , and there seemed to be nobody in the bank just then who could take his place . She hung up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her father were only here ! How strange that all this should have to come just after he had left her ! And he had tried so hard to make everything plain and straight in her little world for her , so there would be no perplexities . Just then the telephone rang again and it was Mr. Lorrimci " Is that you , Miss Thurston ? I 'm Lorrimer , your lawyer . They told me you had just called for Mr. Worden so you know he has not yet returned , and that I have not been able to talk with him except briefly on the telephone , just as 1a was catching another train . But I did learn that he knew ( t the secret compartment in the desk , and that there had been articles left there for you , things of your mother 's , meant foi you . They were to be taken to the bank , after you had gone over them , and selected what you wished to keep here . HI told me where to find the list of these things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them are in our vault . Of course we can not check definitely until Mr. Worden returns , but I have been comparing notes with the police headquarters , and so far they have discovered a handsome jeweled pin fastened in the coat of the young man , under the sleeve lining . He claims that his girl gave it to him when he went away to war . But so far we can find no record of his having been accepted in either the army or navy , and his mother 's stories and his do not agree . We are holding them for further questioning , and to give them a more thorough searching . The woman is wearing a very handsome bracelet on her upper arm under a heavy sleeve . It might be the diamond bracelet but she claims it is rhinestones , and that you gave it to her . " " No ! " said Eden . " I never gave her anything . " " I have not seen it yet , " went on Lorrimer . " We will have it examined of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gotten possession of it if the young man stole it during thep51night we have not yet figured out , but it might have been done . The list names some unmounted jewels , three emeralds , a ruby , and four sapphires , one a star sapphire . They seem to have been a part of your grandmother 's dowry . We have tried to find them in the bank , but they are not there . They are things that can be easily hidden in clothing . I suppose there will have to be a trial , I am not sure . But be assured we will do our best to keep you out of this whole matter , so please do not worry . Eden turned away from the telephone at last with a degree of peace in her heart . At least she was assured that her affairs were in safe hands , and she could rest on that . And after allwhat were jewels ? She could live without them . She had been happy before she knew of their existence . Of course she would like to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why should she make herself miserable over their loss ? She found herself exceedingly weary of the whole matter . So , telling Janet she was going to take a nap , she went up to her room , and curling up on her bed fell into a deep sleep . CASPAR CARVEL turned up before dinner after all . He hadbeen used to barging into their house whenever he liked to a meal , when he was a lad , and he figured that times had n't changed even if there had been a war . Eden was in the big living room curled up in a chair , reading a book she had found among some mail that had come to her father since his death . She had unwrapped it , and satp52down to find out what it was , when the door opened and Caspar walked in , just as if it were yesterday that he went away . " Hello , Lovely ! " he said , " my buddie took an earlier train than he had expected . He went up to New York to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I figured perhaps you 'd be het ( anyway , so I came . Think they 'll have dinner enough for mc too , or will I have to take you out to a restaurant ? " He fin ished with his well-known grin , and suddenly it did seem only yesterday that he had gone away . Eden looked up smiling , trying to put a note of gaiety into her voice , for surely that was what he , a returned soldier , deserved . He must have seen plenty of hardship and sorrow and horror ; and was just trying to put it all out of his thoughts , as of course he ought to do if he was to return to living . " Come in , " she said brightly , holding out her hand to greet him . " Of course there 'll be enough dinner for you . Did you ever get turned away hungry from this house ? " " No , " he responded heartily , " I never did ! " and he grasped the hand she held out , possessively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawn her close within his arms and kissed her most thoroughly on either cheek , her eyes , and then her mouth , as if he had all the rights in the world , as if she had been his always . He did not seem to notice that her lips did not respond to his in the kiss . He was the master of the situation and was entirely satisfied with the way he was conducting the scene . But Eden gasped , and struggled back away from him . " Caspar ! Do n't ! Please do n't ! " and she turned her head away from his attempted repetition of the kiss . . " Why , what 's the matter , Beautiful ? Are n't you glad to seep53me ? Do n't tell me you do n't like to be kissed . Every girl likesthat . And I have a reputation for being good at it . " His possessivehands reached out to draw her close again , but Edenin quick alarm backed off definitely from him and drew her -- self to her full height . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But  --  but Baby , do n't be stagy ! All the girls kiss the army boys , and all the army boys kiss the girls . It 's the custom , you know . It 's a part of patriotism . Why , they all kissed us when we went away , and of course now we 're back we kiss them , and they like it . " " Oh , " said Eden coldly , retiring from his near vicinity . " Was this supposed to be an army regulation ? A sort of mass salute ? Well , you see , I 'm not like the rest . I do not like it . Wo n't you sit down and be yourself , Caspar ? Where have you been and what have you been doing ? " " Oh , for gosh 's sake , Eden , do I have to recite my exploits to you ? Wait till next week and hear me over the radio . That 'll be enough . And now suppose we talk about you . You certainly have n't wasted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have really known you if I had met you in New York , say . You 're quite sophisticated , too . You 're not a dowdy little kid the way you used to be . You 're gorgeous . You really are more than pretty . I never dreamed you 'd get to be so goodlooking . Of course I missed you a lot when I first went away , but they kept us so darned busy out there I did n't have much time to think about you , and then in between we used to have a lotta fun . The girls everywhere we went had dances for us . I 've learned to dance you know , and I 'm pretty swell at it , they tell me . You and I will have to try it the next time I come back . How long do you have to stay cooped up here before you can go out again and get around among ' em ? I'dp54like to take you up to New York and show you around . See life , you know . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've been to New York , you know , quite a good many times , " she said . " I used to go up with father every time he had business up there , and we always had wonderful times together . " " Oh , yes , I suppose you did , " said Caspar contemptuously . " Symphony concerts , and lectures and stuffy things like that . But I mean see real life . I 'm crazy to take you to night clubs and shows . " " Oh , " she reminded him with dignity , " night clubs are not at all my style . I would n't care for them . " " Oh , but you do n't know . You 've never been out and seen real life . You do n't know what you 're missing . Wait till I get you to a few places I know , you 'll be crazy about it . Do n't be stuffy , Eden . " " Thank you , " said Eden in a really cold voice now , " I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not want to see it . 1 like real things . " " Aw , ye gods ! If I ever saw such puritanical notions . Anybodywould think you were an old woman in your dotage . Be your age and have a good time . I thought of course you'dget over those silly notions when you got away from your puritanical father . " Well , I have n't , Caspar , " she said with flashing eyes . " I d rather not talk any more about it . I certainly do n't think youhave improved when you talk like that . You always used to be respectful to my father . " " Oh , sure , he was a good guy , and all that . But he 's gonenow and it ca n't hurt him any if you have a little good time . " " That is n't my idea of a good time , " said Eden quietly . " Suppose you tell me some of your experiences abroad . Whatp55countries were you in ? Italy ? Oh , you saw the Forum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been fascinated by Rome . And were you in Switzerland at all ? Tell me about it . " " Oh , that ! " said the young man contemptuously . " Mountainsof course , and wonderful sunsets , and castles , and all like that . But I 'm not keen on scenery , and I was glad to get back to city life . I enjoyed Paris most . " He rattled off into a description of a few gay gatherings and told some jokes he thought were funny , that Eden did n't appreciate . She was glad when Tabor came and announced dinner and they could go out to the table . Caspar was talking a lively stream of reminiscence as he drew back Eden 's chair for her , and then sat down , but Eden waited quietly till he came to the end of a sentence and then she said shyly , " Caspar , you used to ask the blessing when we were children . Will you ask it now ? " Caspar grinned , looked at her as if she were joking , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't believe I remember any of those little old prayers , " he said . " You get away from all that sort of thing when you go to war , you know . " But Eden did not smile . She quietly bowed her head and said quite simply as she had been taught to do in childhood : " Lord , we thank Thee for this food , and we ask Thy blessing upon us tonight , Amen . " The two servants stood at their places for serving with bowed heads , just as Caspar rememberedthey did whenever he came over to dinner , only it was usually Mr. Thurston who asked the blessing in recent years . Nevertheless , there was something impressive in the whole little ceremony , something distinctly admirable and quaint in the young girl who had taken her place in life even as she had been trained to do . The annoyed young soldierp56bowed his head reluctantly . Maybe it was n't so ridiculous as the world would think it was . It was rather sweet in a way , and Eden was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must have a mint of money . People with money could get away with oddities . He had never thought of money very much before . But getting back from war and seeing all this quiet elegance made him feel that it would n't be bad to have a part in a life like this . He must take care not to antagonize his old friend . And of course it would be easy to train Eden , and get her away from her religious fancies when he had her under his control . He had always been able to influence her , he flattered himself . Then the excellent dinner was served , further strengthening his faith in money and its powers . Caspar roused himself to be agreeable , and fall in with her " prejudices " as he called them . Janet from her humble position as servant was in and out , bringing dishes , and messages to Tabor from the cook ; and Caspar chatted on , asking questions about their old school friends , exhibiting a wider knowledge of some of their moves than even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while he was away . " Cassie Howard got married , and then got herself divorced , did n't she ? " " Oh , " said Eden thoughtfully , " did she ? I did n't know . 1 never knew Cassie very well , you know . " " Oh , " well , you did n't lose much , I guess . You see her first husband was in my regiment , and he had all kinds of tales to tell me , including some pretty rotten facts about the fellow she married next . You know he was a bomber , and was killed in a crash . Nobody knows what Cassie will do next . She 's pretty thick now with a married man . Rich , he is , too , and not much reputation . "  | " Oh , " said Eden with a shiver . " What terrible things are happening ! " " Well , " said Caspar with a careless shrug , " that 's war for you . When you see people getting killed on every side you think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Why not have a good time while we 're at it ? ' It really has that effect on you a lot . " Eden gave him a troubled searching look . " I know people it has not affected in that way , " she said shyly . " Then they were softies , I 'll bet ! " said the young soldier . " No , " said Eden , " they were n't softies . One was a man with all kinds of wonderful citations to his credit . Another had completed a long list of missions , and wore a silver star and a medal for special bravery . He told me himself that the whole thing gave him a different view of life and he felt life was more serious than he had ever thought . " Caspar 's lips went up in a sneer , and for a moment he forgot that he had planned to agree with her . " Not me ! " he said , shaking his head . " You 'll find all that talk some of those would-be-heroes give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with some of their home folks , so they are workingit for all they are worth . I say they are softies when they talk that way . I say live like a sport and die like a hero . That 's all there is to it . " Eden looked at him aghast . " Why Caspar ! You talk like a heathen . Did n't you join the church when I did ? You believe in God and Christian standards , do n't you ? " " Oh yes , I joined church . But it 's all a lot of popycock . Kid stuff , you know . Nobody believes that line today . We 've wised up . Science has taught us a lot . We 've worked out a better linep58of behavior today , more fitted to the times . We 've left the da ' of self-sacrifice behind , and have come to the time when it ' every man for himself , and the best man wins the race . Hov else would you think they would have got us fellows to go out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I tell you times havt changed , Edie , and you 'd better get wise to it or you 'll be good and left behind . It 's time for you to get busy and have some fun before you get old You 've got a good complexion and a preu face , and if you 'll just drop your traditions , put on some makeupand get into things , we could team up and have a great life . How about it , girl . I 'm for it if you are ! " He had almost finished his dessert now , and was about to ash if he might have another piece of pie , as he would have done in the days that were gone . But Eden was not eating hers . Sh ( had scarcely taken a bite . She was watching her erstwhile playmate in consternation . And as he finished his extraordinaryproposal she stiffened in a kind of fury . " Stop ! " she said . " Do n't speak another word like that . If you feel that way you are no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the past . You are trampling on God ! I am ashamed of you . God who has brought you through the war unscathed . " " Not on yer life He did n't , " said Caspar with a sneer . " 1 brought myself through . What did God have to do with it ? If I had n't been courageous and gone out to kill , and not to be killed , if I had n't studied out ways to find easy-street when I was sent on a mission , and let the other fellow take the raps , do you think I 'd have been here today ? How about all those others that got killed ? What did God do for them ? " " Stop ! " said Eden rising excitedly . " You shall not talk that way about God in this house . If my father were here he would put you out for that , and I will not hear another word . Gop59away ! I do n't want ever to see you again , not unless you find out how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Get clown on your knees and tell God you are ashamed and sorry . I do n't see how I can ever forget what you have said , or count you my friend . I think you are awful ! " Eden was very beautiful as she stood there in her righteous anger and flashed her lovely eyes at her former friend . And Caspar was suddenly realizing what a fool he had been to let her see what he felt so early in the game . He rose with a wistful look toward his empty pie plate , and realized that he must placate this angry girl or his plans for the evening would he all upset . So he put on for him . " Aw , Eden , forget it ! I did n't mean all that stuff of course . I just want you to see you 're getting hayseeds in your hair , and it is n't done today . Your father did n't realize he was making you an old woman before your time by feeding you such antediluvian ideas as he did . Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was young , but he was sick and getting old , and he did n't see how the modern successes were growing away from all those fool ideas . Of course those things are very becoming in a lady if she does not carry them too far . Eden darling , forget what I said . I love you Eden , ca n't you see that ? And I want you to be just perfect . Darling ! " The young man came quickly near to her and letting his arm steal about her softly , put his clean-shaven cheek close to hers in a loving embrace , with intent to kiss her in a regular way that she would not forget . They were standing in the hall doorway now , and Eden , startled , furious , gasping , struggled away from him , even as she brought her right hand about in a quick swing and dealt him a ringing slap across his amorous mouth , followed byp60another stinging blow across his eyes . Then turning she flew across the hall and up the stairs as if on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the young soldier below her who was bent in pain and struggling to overcome the effect of the blinding blows she had dealt him . " Go away ! " she called , " and never come back again ! " Then she went into her room , shut the door sharply and turned the key in the lock . Both Janet and Tabor were in the offing , having heard it all of course , though discreetly in the background . Now Tabor came forward with the young man 's cap and coat in his hands : " You 'd best be going ! " he advised in his most severe and unfriendly tone , and helped Caspar on with his coat , handed him his hat , and opened the front door for him . So Caspar Carvel staggered blindly down the steps , pausing a moment at the walk , with his hand over his eyes , to recover his poise and self-assurance , and then vanished down the street and around the corner . Upstairs Eden in her quiet room threw herself on her bed weeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was utterly unworthy and had gone out of her life forever . In an interval as her sobs subsided Eden heard Janet 's gentle step , and then a soft tap on the door . She was still a minute , and then as the tap was repeated she quieted her sobs and got back her voice : " Yes ? " she said . " Who is it ? " " It 's juist old Janet , my leddy . I merely wanted to enquire of you would want the perlice sent for again . " " The police ? " said Eden , opening the door and presenting an astonished face . " Come in , Janet . What do you mean ? " " Wull , " said Janet as Eden let her in , " I thought as ye hadp61throwed out two young gentlemen , mebbe ye was expectin ' a third yet , the night ? " Then suddenly Eden went off into a peal of laughter . BUT tears and laughter did not entirely banish the trouble from Eden 's thoughts . She kept going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really mean all those terrible things ? And how had she answered him ? Was it right to send him away like that never to return ? But of course it was enough to raise her righteous wrath , just the way he had spoken of her father . Her wonderful father ! Even if Mr. Thurston had been old-fashioned , which he was n't in the least , Caspar had no right , just after death had taken her father away , to come into the home where he had always been welcomed and bring him into scorn before his own daughter . She was right to feel it was outrageous . She was right to rebuke him for that . But when he not only did that , but brought her father 's God into contempt also , what could she do but strike ? Send him away ? And now there came to her memory of other days . Why ! Caspar had been as earnest as any of the others in their young people 's meeting which they all attended . He even made good speeches , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be so proud of him for he had a way with him when he was president of their society , and said so many good things , so fitting to the subject . Was it possible that he had so utterly changed ? It almost seemed to her that he must have beenp62drinking or he never would have talked like that , though the Caspar of old never drank . Had he learned to do that too , as well as to despise holy things ? Not that Eden herself had ever been particularly spiritual , but she had been regular in her church attendance , conforming always to the lines laid down by their church , and the requests of their nice old pastor , being most active in all the activities of the church . But now it suddenly occurred to her that there was something more than mere church activity required to meet a situation in which God Himself had been challenged , and somehow she felt she did n't have it . At least she did n't know how to answer one who talked as Caspar had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if anybody ever talked like that again in her presence . She just could n't stand it . There must be an answer to such blasphemies , or her father , her good wise father , would never have believed . It was n't thinkable that such triflers as Caspar could actually dare to flout the tenets of the Christian religion . Oh , she had of course heard of unbelief before , but she had always thought of unbelievers as low-down vicious people who had no culture or education . So carefully her father had guarded her that she had been sent to schools that did not spend their time in breaking down respectable religious beliefs that had carried generations of good people along in a placid faith and trust . So now Eden was bewildered that her old playmate who had been brought up in what she had always thought was a respectable way had gone back on basic doctrines and beliefs . Somewhere she would have to find a way to answer this if he ever came back to discuss the matter with her  --  or if anybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should come her way . Probablyher father knew ways to answer such things , and bring unbelievers to see the right , but she could n't recall that he hadp63ever given her proofs to store in her mind . Yet she was sure beyond the shadow of a doubt that her father had believed in God , and had gone to Heaven , trusting in the blood of Christ . She was sure he was expecting to go straight to God in Heaven , when he said good-by to her , and that her dear mother would be there also . She knew from her mother 's letters that her father and mother had often talked these things over and agreed , and were expecting to be together for all eternity in the presence of God . That was enough for her . She believed it because they did . But that was not enough to help her tell other people about it . She had to know why wise Christian ministers and saints believed these things . It had never troubled her before . It was the accepted belief of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But now a new group had come to her knowledge . Not just low-down heathen in far foreign lands , nor even gangsters who had never wanted to be good , but a group of whom Caspar , at present , was a representative  --  a group of young fellows , who , before they went to war , worked in churches , made speeches and prayed in meetings . And now that they had come back from facing death they had come to the belief that there was no God , no salvation , no right ; that it was all a line of talk . She had n't talked with others who said so , but Caspar seemed to take it for granted that she knew that all who were not softies felt that way about religion now , and she had to know . She had to know for sure how to prove that God was still God , and could save , and Heaven was real , or else she could not go on even for herself . And how else could she help others to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever help Caspar , suppose he ever came back again after the way she had treated him ? There must be a way to find out why reasonable people believed all that.  |p64She  decided finally that she would go to church next Sunday and see if anything was said that would bring her light on the problem . And if she could n't get anything out of church she would go to the minister and ask him questions . It was not that her own faith in God was shaken . She believed in her father 's God too much to be troubled on her own account , but now that the question had been brought up she felt she must understand it . It was doubtless true that her father had talked about such things long ago , when she was very young , and had merely supposed that she had understood it , and so said nothing more . Just as a teacher would not be continually harping on the alphabet after one had learned to read . So thinking it out Eden went back to the book she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to her father since his death , evidently ordered by him from the publisher . And now she noticed for the first time the subject of this book , whose perusal Caspar 's entrance had interrupted ; it was religious . Ah , perhaps this was just what she was looking for . Perhaps this would give proofs and arguments that there was a God , arguments that she could use if she ever had to talk again with Caspar . Eagerly she began to read and was amazed at the simplicity of the wording , and the startling truths that were set down as facts . For the first time in her life , although she had gone to Sunday School since she was a little child , and to church every Sunday  --  sometimes twice or three times a day  --  she began to take it in that God considered everyone a sinner . Of course she had heard about sinners , but she had never realized that people like her father classed in such a category . For the first time she took in the great thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a dead spiritual nature . That all ofp65Adam 's children had inherited a tendency to sin , and that Satan was using that sinful tendency of mankind to turn men , even Christians , against the Son , Jesus Christ . And where he failed to turn them actually against Christ , he was engaged in trying to make it appear that he was doing Christ 's work , or more subtle still , trying to make the world believe there was no devil and no sin . Eden read on , fascinated , because the book was written most simply and originally , yet it touched on themes she had never before heard discussed , or if she had , she had never taken any notice of them . There was " original sin " that seemed to belong to everybody . She had never thought of herself as a sinner . She had always tried to do right , to please her father and mother , and do the things that were expected of her , yet here was this strange book saying " All have sinned and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , as if this not only was meant for gangsters and low-down people , but as if it might have some kind of meaning for good right-living people . And another phrase , " Ye must be born again . " But surely that did not mean church members ! Strange ! What was this doctrine , anyway ? Why did her father send for this book ? Or was it just sent to him to advertise it ? Yet she could n't lay it down , and kept on reading till little by little she began to wonder if all this could be true . What was being " born again , " anyway ? There had been a Sunday School lesson long ago in her childhood about a man who came to Jesus and wanted to know how to be saved , and He had told him that he must be born again . But she had always supposed that that man had been a very wicked person , so wicked that Jesus saw he had just to begin all over again . And was n't he wealthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She had never thought of this advice as applyingp66to good right-minded people . She could n't help feeling a little outraged that anyone should think she herself  --  well , at least her father , anyway  --  needed to be born again . Perhaps this was some sort of heretical book that she ought not to bother with . Yet because it had been sent to her father she felt she must know more about it . Besides , the book itself was intriguing . It seemed to speak to her very soul , to make her suspect things in her heart that she did not know were there , that she had never dreamed were objectionable to God . So she went on reading , until suddenly Janet knocked at the door . " Are ye asleep , Miss Eden ? I 'm sorry to disturb ye , but a mon downstairs seems tae think he ought tae see ye richt away . It 's that lawyer mon from the bank , and he says there 's something important ye ought to know at oncet . Could ye coom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ye lang . " " Why , of course , Janet . No , I was n't asleep . I was just reading one of daddy 's books . " Eden jumped up , her finger in the page where she had been reading , and hurried down the stairs . The young man was standing in the hall , glancing at his watch . " I hope I have n't disturbed you , Miss Thurston . Mr. Worden has telephoned again and he wanted me to get in touch with you and tell you what has been discovered so far . " " Oh , you have n't disturbed me , " said Eden pleasantly . " I was only reading . Come into the living room and sit down . Of course I 'm anxious to know if there are any new developments . " " Well , yes , there are , " said the young man . " They 've found some more jewels sewed quite neatly in the lining of the youngp67man 's coat . Also several concealed in the woman 's hat , and even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cleverly concealed that they were not discovered at first , and so have just come to light . Of course the woman claims that you gave them to her , but in view of the fact that you knew nothing about some of the other things she said you gave her , we felt you should see them at once . Also most of these things answer to the description of the articles in the bank list as from that secret compartment . Now , will you look at them ? See , I have put them out here on the piano so they wo n't confuse us . Here 's the diamond bracelet . Do you remember ever seeing it before ? " Eden shook her head . " I 'm not sure , " she said . " I dimly remember sitting on my mother 's lap and putting my hand on something on her wrist , and saying ' Pitty , pitty . ' At least there is a story in the family to that effect , and I 've heard it so much that it may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been the bracelet . I do n't know . " " It were ! " announced Janet arriving quietly in the room . " Ye was settin ' on yer mother 's lap , an ' playin ' wi ' her bracelet , an ' they was one o ' the verra first words ye spoke . ' Pitty , pitty . ' An ' yer feyther was that pleased ! An ' thet 's the verra bracelet . I mind it well . " So they went down the line of jewels . Some Eden vaguely remembered having seen before , others she knew nothing about , but all of them were familiar to Janet who had often helped Eden 's mother put her treasures away carefully . " Well , that 's about the crop so far . All single jewels in the list are found , except a few rubies , and they may turn up in the possession of the two crooks . We are going to search them again carefully . But they have enough on them already top68definitely put them in jail . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ checked on their movements out West , and find that the boy had once before escaped from confinement there , where he was being held for trial for forgery and complicity in robbery . I 'm afraid they are really hardened criminals . " Eden shivered a little and looked distressed . " Oh , why do people want to be like that ? " she said . " I never did like them , nor enjoy having them around , but why do you suppose they choose to be that way ? Were they born so ? " " Well , yes , I suppose they were . That is , they were born with a sinful nature , " said the young man thoughtfully , " the same kind of nature we all have of course , only some of us choose to sin in more respectable ways , " he smiled disarmingly . " People do n't have to be crooks unless they choose to be . We do n't have to follow every evil thought that comes to us . They know the things they plan to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They take a chance that they can get away with it . This time they did n't get away with it . " Eden looked at the young man with interested eyes . " That sounds a little like something I was reading just now in this book that was sent to my father . " " Why , yes , I suppose it must . I was just noticing the book in your hand . I 've heard of it and often wanted to read it . As soon as I get settled into real living since army days I want to do some reading . Just now I have n't time , but from what I 've heard about that you 'll find it a great book . Do n't you ? " " Oh , I have n't read but a few pages yet . I was just lookingit over and it seemed quite new and strange to me . If it had n't been sent to father 's address I would n't have known whether to trust it or not , but I rather think he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a different kind of book when I first opened it , and then I got interested . Butp69perhaps you would know of a book I could get to answer someone who does n't believe in God any more . Is there such a book ? Surely there must be somewhere . There are so many good people and so many fine churches . " The young man looked at her with quick surprise and a gentle pity . " Oh , yes , there are books , plenty of them . Of course the Bible is the crowning book . But did your friend ever believe in God ? " Eden cast him a puzzled look . " Why , I suppose he did , " she said as if she were trying to think back to the past . " He joined the church at the same time I did . Are n't all church members supposed to believe in God ? " " Yes , " said the young man sorrowfully , " supposed to believe . But they do not always do it . Sometimes they do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just accepting a general belief that is popular among their friends . Jesus Christ means nothing at all to them . I know a lot of ex-Christians like that myself , some of them were never taught , or had never been introduced to the Lord Jesus . Of course that is the best proof that there is a God , if you know Jesus Christ . When one really knows Him he can never doubt again . Do you mind my asking if you know Him ? " " Oh , " said Eden with distinct trouble in her eyes , " I do n't know . I  --  supposed I was all right . I never really heard anybodyput it that way . I did n't know it was possible to know the Lord till you got to Heaven . How could you know Him on this earth ? " And it was just at that moment that Tabor , who had answered a ring on the telephone , came in to say : " Beg pardon , sir , but there is a call for you on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about to catch a train . " " Oh , will you excuse me a moment , Miss Thurston ? " said the young man , and hurried to the telephone in the hall . Eden stood pondering what he had been saying , amazed that a young man of his age and standing should be so earnestly interested in religious matters . Perhaps he would be able to help her perplexities . Then he hung up the receiver and returned to her : " I am sorry to interrupt our conversation just at this point , but this message was urgent and I must go at once . May I talk to you again sometime about it ? " " Oh , yes , " said Eden . " I want to know very much what you were going to say . " " Very well then , I 'll be seeing you later . Soon , I hope . Good night ! " and he was gone , leaving a great wonder in her heart and an intense admiration for a man who could speak in this assured way of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her book , and somehow it became more alive and real than before she had had that talk with the lawyer . ANET , what d'ye think ? Will that impertinent boy Cappiecome back again , or are we rid of him fer good ? " " Weel , Tabor , I dootna he 'll coom back soom toime , if not richt at oncet . But he was pretty weel astonished at the way my leddy treated him . I canna blame her , fer he was juist awfoo ' talkin ' thet wy about the master an ' the master notp71dead a week yet , an ' him allus sae kind tae the lad ' fore he wint awa ' tae war . He showed no tender feelin 's at all , either fer my leddy , ner him . An ' as fer his Maker , It cowes a ' , hoo he could lift oop his head an ' speak like thet . Do ye nae think he 'd been drinkin ' , Tabor ? " " No , " said the old serving man , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did n't smell it on his breath when I he'ped him on with his topcoat . Besides , it 's not likely he would come here with that on his breath , knowin ' how the family feels about young men drinkin ' ! " " Weel , he kens juist the same hoo they feel aboot God , an ' yet he spoke oot like a regular heathen . " " Yes , I know , but that 's the way a lot o ' the kids are talkin ' now . They learn that in school . They think it 's smart . My niece 's boy was talkin ' some like thet the last week end when I was home , an ' he 's only a high-school kid . He said the teachers okayed talk like that . That is he said some of the teachers talked that way right in class . Though when I narrowedit down , he owned up there was only one teacher of the whole lot talked that way , and laughed at the Bible . " " Dear me ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tae ? Nae vvunner the master dreaded tae leave his wee bairnie alane in a worl ' like this . I hoop thet Carver lad stays in the army . We dinna want him around here , mooch as I useta loike him when he was a slip of a lad . But he niver was a match fer oor young leddy . I 'm certain bein ' in the war hasna improved him ony , though I will say there are some as is quite fine an ' different since they coom back . " " Yes , " agreed Tabor , " I reckon it has improved some , made ' em more thoughtful-like an ' considerate . That young lawyer seems a nice sort . Where does he come in ? I do n't seem to remember him around here before the war . "  | " Nae . He wasna . Marnie the oopstairs maid says she heard he 's the soon o ' an ole frind o ' Meester Woorden . He was stoody'in ' law afore he enlisted , an ' whin he goat back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intae the firm . " " So ! That 's the way of it ! Well , he 's some man . I 'd like to see our young lady get a man like that . " " Weel , he do seem loike a braw laddie . But it 'll be the way the Lord pions , " said Janet with a sigh , as if she were a little dubious how that would turn out , and would fain get her own hands on the planning . But over in her own room Eden was deep in her book , and as she read farther and farther she kept recalling the words of the young lawyer , and was more and more impressed by what he had said , wishing he were here now so that she might ask him a few questions . Strange it was how a young stranger had been able to impress thoughts upon her just when she was exercised about these things . How very different he was from Caspar . It somehow seemed more and more as if Caspar had n't really grown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grown undesirably . And a few blocks away in a small pleasant room on the tenth floor of a modest apartment house young Lorrimer was preparing for rest after a long hard day . He was reading his Bible , jotting down a few notes in his small diary , thinking of the sweet girl who had asked him such unexpected questions , looking up a book he thought she might like to see , and at last kneeling to pray for her , his heart more deeply stirred for her than perhaps it had ever been stirred for any other person . And that was strange , because he scarcely knew her at all , and from what he knew of her station in life , and her fortune , she was n't at all a girl on whom he would have felt he could fasten his interest.  |p73He  puzzled over that idea for a moment as he prayed , and then he said to himself , " Of course not , but that need not hinder my interest in her salvation , and I do n't believe she quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dear Father ! " Those were strange days that followed . Eden spent much time in her room reading the wonderful book that she had found , growing more and more filled with interest in it . But often she was interrupted by the coming of old friends . Three sweet old ladies who used to know her mother , and who , though they had not kept much in touch with Eden since she had grown up , felt a duty toward her for old friendship'ssake . They all talked of the old days , and fairly purred over her state of loneliness , and wished she would come and see them . It was all a little hard to bear . Then there were a few older men , intimate friends of her father 's . These she knew better because they had been often at the house when he was living and she liked them and was glad to see them . But through it all she was thinking now and then of the book she had been reading , and wondering if these people knew the doctrines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everybody knew . There were other callers in the afternoons , girls she knew well , some coming shyly in , some boisterously , because they hated the idea of death , and did n't exactly know what to say , especially because Eden had always been so devoted to her father , and they felt she must be now in the depths of despair without him . They spoke of having seen Caspar , wondered if he were still in town , or had gone back to New York . Some of them had hoped perhaps Eden would be out , and so the day of calling on her might be postponed . Eden was such a reserved girl , and seldom reacted as they would have done . They were sure she would not burst into tears and weepp74hysterically , or would never be giddy nor gay . But they felt uncomfortable . Of course they were sorry for her , but they did not feel they knew her well enough to be sure how she would meet them . Of course they were relieved when they found she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she had met with a hopeless disaster , no mark of shock on her lovely face . A few of her old boy friends came in the evening , in groups of two or three . They made a good deal of noise and rollickedII quite a little to cover up their embarrassment , but Eden understood . They had been good friends of her father too . Some of them had been in the bank . She knew that they mourned for her father who had always been so kind to them , and she was smiling and pleasant with them , trying to act as she knew her father would wish her to do , and make them feel comfortable . She appreciated their coming , and knew it had been hard for them . Then there were two or three of the older fellows from the bank who came , singly ; most of them had something pleasant to tell her about what her father had done for them , some pleasant remembrance of him while they had been working under him . Each time when it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lovely warm feeling that she had been with her father for a little while . It was so beautiful to hear them praise him , and show that they so fully realized his worth . It spread a healing balm over the sore wounds that her former friend Caspar had so thoughtlessly caused . It was four days later that Mr. Worden , her father 's confidentand friend , returned . He came at once to see her . After she had had a talk with him she felt greatly strengthened to go on in the way that her father had planned for her , and not at all apprehensive concerning the Fanes . Mr Worden assured herp75he would look after them . Their trial was to come off in a few days now and he personally would talk with them both and see if he could n't knock some sense into them . It was while they were talking together , however , and she was just feeling so happy and comforted that the telephone rang and Mr. Worden was wanted at once . It was young Lorrimer talking , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eden , who had followed to the hall to give a message to Janet , could not help hearing a little , and so she stood with wide-open eyes , and a frightened expression on her face , her hands clasped over her heart . " Oh , " she said as Mr. Worden hung up the receiver and turned toward her , " something more has happened at the police station , has n't it ? I heard the word escape . ' Tell me , please , what it is . You need n't be afraid . I do n't get frightened , you know . But I like to understand thoroughly and then I wo n't make so many mistakes . " Her old friend smiled . " I know , Eden . You would n't be your father 's own daughter if you were n't like that of course . But this is nothing that need worry you anyway . It only concerns the police . It is entirely out of your hands . " " But who has escaped ? " insisted Eden . " Ellery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , " admitted the man , " and they have n't quite figured out how it happened . They thought they had them safely guarded . But they 'll soon be caught of course , and then we 'll see that there are no more pranks played on the law . " Then the telephone rang again and this time it was Mike . " Miss Eden , could I speak with Tabor a moment ? Some/body seems to be using the kitchen telephone and this is urgent . " Tabor was on the spot at once . " Tabor speaking , Mike . What ? You do n't say . Right-o . Mike , I 'll check on the cellar , and the garage and the outside shed . Yes , there might have been some old coats and other things that were used by the gardener . Do you think they would dare come here again ? " " Shure . They 'd think that was the last place we would look for them . Where else could they go in a hurry ? No hideouts around here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She got around her keeper by pretending to be very sick . She asked to have her son sent for . Thought she was dying . Two guards brought the guy over , and she had another bad spell with her heart , almost died . Manda , our guard-woman , went for water quick , and when she got back they were gone . How they managed to get out is a mystery . They musta had this all planned before they began this show . Better check on your place right away . Put Janet wise too . And take it easy ; they 're smooth . They are n't new at this job . Better keep yer gun handy , but watch out how you use it . I 'm sending two of my men over . They are on their way now . So long ! " Tabor did not wait to convey the intelligence . He vanished toward the kitchen . But Eden and her caller had heard enough to understand . " Oh ! " said Eden . " How terrible daddy would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing like this to go through ! " " Well , it 's a mercy he did n't know . It would have distressed him of course , but we 'll take care of you and your interests , child ! " " Of course ! I know , " said Eden smiling . " Only it seems sop77awful that two people we have known , no matter how disagreeablewe thought them , should turn out to do things like this . Do you know , Uncle Worden , I never realized what sin was before , nor how much of it there could be all about us when we did n't see it ourselves . " " Yes , that is certainly true , " said the man thoughtfully . " But you , kitten , ought not to have to think about sin . It will never touch you . You are not a sinner . " " Oh , but I am , Uncle Worden , and I 've just found it out ! " exclaimed Eden . " I found a book of daddy 's , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reading it . I think it is a theological hook . Father was interested in such things , you know , and I 've been very much interested in it myself . I find that the Bible says that we have all sinned and come short of the glory of God , and that nobody is able , in themselves , to please a just and righteous God . That Jesus Christ was the only one who never sinned . Of course in a way I knew that from Sunday School when I was a child , but I never realized it before . But the thing I ca n't understand is why people when they get old enough to understand should deliberately choose to be sinners instead of wanting to follow God , and be saved . Why , for instance , should Mrs. Fane start out to do what she must know is wrong , instead of teaching her boy to do right and doing right herself ? " " Well , " said Mr. Worden , somewhat perplexed and very much embarrassed over her questions , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father was always one who could study up deep problems like that and find the answers , but I always had to be content with just following out the line the church has marked out for us . That seemed easiest and best . But maybe this Mrs. Fane did this because she loved her son and wanted to save hirn . Or maybe he and she both wantedp78things they could n't afford to buy and so they took the dis honest way to get them . That must be the explanation . How ever , do n't you think maybe we ought to call up and see if there is anything more we can do to help find these people ? We certainly do n't want them hiding around this house all night . I would n't think of allowing you to stay here under any such circumstances . There ! There goes the phone again . Perhaps that 's my man Lorrimer again . Shall I answer ? " It was Lorrimer . He had been to police headquarters and had a bit of news . It seemed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his dinner . It was dull , and not very effectual as a weapon , but he had managed to pry up a stone from the corner of his cell , and worked away carefully and cautiously until it had assumed alarming sharpness . That was n't the first knife that Ellery had practiced the same act upon , and he had developed some skill in the art . Ellery was still missing and so was the knife , but one of the guards left behind unconscious on the floor in front of the empty cell had a deep slash scientifically placed which testified to the ugliness of the knife , and now that the guard was being brought back to consciousness he would more than likely be able to add details to the story of the escape . But in the meantime , just before the incident took place , the prison authorities had discovered another jewel sewn cleverly into the lining of the prisoner 's coat , which had , of course , been taken from him . Naturally the young man had fled without his coat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authorities . But the peculiar thing about it was that this jewel was not one listed among the Thurston lists . It seemed to be a rare diamond , probably guarded carefully , and possibly stolen from some other person , unless Mr. Worden could remember , or find some record of such a stone.  |p79Eden  as she listened began to feel that she was living in a wicked fairy tale . And then Mr. Worden came in with troubled face . " Tabor has been hurt , " he said and his voice was much troubled , for he had known Tabor for many years and knew how they all regarded him . " They are bringing him in . They found him lying unconscious in front of the tool house with a knife in his back . Eden , can you telephone for the doctor quickly while I bring a mattress down for him to be laid on ? I 'm afraid this is serious . " Eden flew to the telephone and fortunately got the doctor , who promised to come at once . Eden found she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had put Tabor down . He was lying on his side on the mattress , and the knife , the crude prison knife , was still sticking in his back , a stream of blood making a crimson stream down his immaculate white linen coat . " That 's a prison dinner knife , " said Mike , who had helped to carry Tabor in . " That settles it . He must have been hidden in the tool house . " Eden 's eyes were wide with horror . To think that all this could happen in their quiet home , and just after her father had gone ! She felt unnerved . But quick as a flash she saw something she could do that took her mind off herself and her fright . She slipped down on the floor beside the mattress where Tabor lay and took his still hand in hers , just quietly , and was there when a moment later the doctor arrived and knelt to feel the pulse , and listen to the heart . While this was going on Janet was n't missed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked , " Where is Janet ? Tell her I need her , " and then they looked around and could n't find Janet , who had always been on hand in any special crisis.  | " Where did she go ? " they asked , and Eden answered quickly , " Oh , I think she went out the back door . She would think she could find the Fanes . Janet was always like that . " It was Mike who slipped out the back door at once and gave a command to look her up , and then was back in the house again doing everything he could find to do devotedly . Meantime Janet had gone out to the little conservatory behind the garage , for that was where some old garments hung that the gardener had been told he might give to a poor family who needed them . It was only a few days ago they were put there , and Janet remembered it , so armed with her flashlight Janet went that way . If the Fanes had come back to the house to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would seek shelter , so reasoned Janet . And though she sighted several policemen near the house , she did not tell them of her suspicions , but marched boldly around the end of the garage and stepping quietly on the grass to drown the sound of her footsteps , she arrived in the doorway and silently turned on her flashlight from the enveloping shelter of her ever-present apron , and plunged it into the darkness of the little greenhouse , centering its light full on the hook where she had hung the garments . Her first object was to find out if they were still there or had been used as a disguise . Janet had a very good mind for reasoning , helped out by the many detective stories she had read in her leisure hours . Janet did not yet know what had happened to Tabor or unquestionably she would have been back in the house helpingto bring Tabor back to consciousness . But not knowing , she was here , engineering another dramatic scene for herself . So she stood in the doorway , looking into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she let the tinyp81pencil of light focus on the hook by the opposite door , the garments appeared to be hanging there just as she had left them a few days ago She was about to turn away and try some other possible hideout , when it seemed to her in the wavering light that she saw or heard a slight movement over by those shadowy garments . Janet was a courageous woman , and afraid of nothing , even the uncanny , but the idea of movement over in that corner sent a thrill up her sturdy old backbone , and her everalertmind leaped to the thought of what she could do all by herself , if it should prove that one of the Fanes was hiding there . She should have brought a policeman with her of course , but stuff and nonsense ! He would only have laughed at her notions , and no real policeman would stand for a woman 's ideas of course , so she swiftly searched in her mind for a way to catch whoever was there , if they were there , before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should get away she would never hear the last of it from Mike for not telling him what she was going to do . But of course she must make sure , so she turned the flashlight full upon the hanging garments which even now showed a slight movement , as if someone or something were alive inside the clothes . Then the bright pencil of light played full upon the place , and there she saw as plain as day , a pair of feet , peepingout from a fold in the long old coat . It took only an instant to recognize a crouching figure , flattened behind those worn old garments , a bony hand clutching the coat across . The rest of the figure was hidden behind the dark green skirt that hung behind the coat . That would be Lavira Fane . Janet was sure of it at once . But how to catch her , that was the question , and there was no time to waste . Down beside Janet 's feet lay a coil of hose , already attached ,  |p82and  at her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the water supply . Could she do it ? She had used it before at times when the gardener had been sick or away , and had asked her to water some special plants . But this , this was something different . She knew she was being watched by a desperate woman , and there was no time to spare . But Janet was not one to hesitate when she had a job to do , she did it . Quick as a flash she stooped and silently caught up the nozzle of the hose , even while her other hand sought the wheel and gave it a twirl . With relief she heard the quick rush of water , and gave her swift attention to the flashlight , directing its rays straight at a pair of desperate eyes now peering out , relieved to see the swift stream plunge straight toward its goal . She turned the full force of water toward the gasping prisoner as the woman flung the disguising clothes aside and tried to get away . But Janet had the water turned on in full force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ground , as she groveled and struggled to get her breath and get away from that terrific force . But now suddenly a great light burst over the place . Someone , perhaps a policeman , had heard the rushing water , and turned on the searchlight from the back porch . Then Janet 's achievement was revealed , and two policemen came rushing to her assistance . They lifted the dripping Lavira to her feet , making her fast with handcuffs as they did so , and now she was screaming anathemas to the men , and declaring they had no right to touch her , that she was a relative of the family and sent out there to get some garments that were to be given away . " Anything around here we can put over her to carry her away , Janet ? " one of the men asked Janet , wondering how they were to get this dripping woman back to jail.  | " There 's an old robe from the master 's car back of you in he garage , " said Janet crisply . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a moment with a heavy old blanket , and ! icy wrapped Lavira in it , and compelled her to the police car . " Get you back to the house , Jan , " called one of the policemien , as they propelled the reluctant prisoner toward the street where their car waited . " We 'll look after this party . You done your work well , an ' now you 'll be needed in the house . Old Tabor was pretty bad hurt . " " Tabor ! Not Tabor ? " ejaculated Janet aghast , and sped with all her might back to the house . THE result of the doctor 's examination of Tabor it wasfound that he had been struck on the head and suffered a concussion in addition to the stab from the knife . At last he had been restored to consciousness , and was resting quietly , watched over by the doctor and a hastily summonednurse . Janet , after a quick consultation with Eden , and afterward with the cook and the chambermaid , hastily transformedthe servant 's dining room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the table and most of the chairs vanished as if by magic , a comfortable iron bed from an upstairs servant 's bedroom was brought down , and in no time Tabor was tenderly transferred to the other bed , where he promptly fell asleep . " Bless his heart , he 'll sleep comfortable now , " meditated Janet , speaking half to Eden , half to the cook who stoodp84near brushing the tears away . " He wouldna have been hap , , in the big dining room . He would juist have got richt oop soon as he kenned whar he was an ' whisked awa ' tae 111 , ain room . Thet 's Tabor . He would niver presoom . But here , he 'd feel at hame , an ' not thenk he was presoomin ' or puttin ' aebody oot . He weel kens we would juist as soon eat in the kitchen . He 'll be mair tae hame here . " Eden smiled . " Yes , that 's right , Janet . But he 'll have to be watched even here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to serve dinne . There never was anybody like Tabor . " " Yes , that 's right ! " agreed the staff of servants , the docto included . A little later the house began to settle down to quietness . Then the telephone rang , and Mike informed Eden who answeredit , that Lavira Fane was safely secure where there could be no further menace from her , and that a posse of men were out after her son , following every clue possible , but as yet they had found no trace of him . Then young Lorrimer arrived in company with Mr. Worden , who said he had arranged with Lorrimer to stay in the house all night and keep him informed if there was any change in Tabor 's condition , as he himself had to be with his wife who was ill and needed him , and he was worried not to have a responsible person at hand whom Eden could call upon in necessity . " Oh , that wo n't be necessary , " protested Eden . " It 's awfully nice of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afraid . " " No , of course you 're not afraid , " said the young lawyer , " but I want to stay . I shall feel easier in my mind if I can be at hand for possible service , even if you do n't think you need me . And I wo n't be any trouble at all . I 'll just dropp85down on that leather couch in the library , or anywhere else you suggest . I 'm used to sleeping in a chair if occasion demands , so do n't worry about me . " " Oh , that is nice of you , and I 'm very glad to have you here , " said Eden with a sudden welcoming smile that left no question . It was while they were still sitting in the living room talking with Mr. Worden that Janet arrived with a goodly tray . Crackers and cookies , and even a few sandwiches , and tea . For in any stress of circumstances Janet considered tea a panaceafor all ills , and could n't bear to let an occasion go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ message from Mike . They thought they had a clue that led to the woods north of the town . There were woods all about the town of Glencarroll , so it was quite a proposition to hunt a fugitive in an area like that . Mike said they were getting bloodhounds , using some of the young man 's clothes that had been in possession of the police department . They felt reasonably sure by this method they might find him . Unless of course he had been able to get away on a train , or hitchhike a ride . Although the highways were being watched at every cross road , and cars stopped and searched . Eden caught her breath . " Oh , this all seems so dreadful . How father would have hated to have things like this happen . " " Yes , " said her father 's friend , " I certainly wish it could have been prevented , or at least that we could have kept the knowledge of it from you . " " Oh , but you could n't ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fane walked into the library where I was going through some letters father had told me to read , and beganp86to say that he and his mother were coming to take care of me , and that he would help me go through all the papers of the estate , and get better investments ! He said he was a financial expert ! " " The insufferable egotist . It sounds like some of the stuff he got off when he was a mere boy in the bank , carrying on his forgery schemes . Well , child , I guess we are fortunate that this has all come out in the open now , instead of having It smolder along out of sight . The whole trouble is that Ellery Fane did manage to get a good deal of information about your father 's estate while he was with us , and he has nevci forgotten that there might be a rich mine for himself if he could only manage to get an entrance here . Well , I 'm sorry , but I do hope the fellow will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I 'll be over early in the morning , Eden , and Lorrimer will let me know sooner than that if anything more happens meanwhile . " When Mr. Worden and the policemen were gone , and while Janet was fixing a comfortable couch with blankets and pillowsfor the lawyer to sleep on , Eden lingered for a moment to speak to him . " You know we have plenty of comfortable sleeping rooms upstairs where you could rest better than in the library , " she said , with a troubled look . " It does n't seem right for you to have to sleep on the couch when you are so kind as to stay here . " " Oh , no , " he said , " I really prefer to be down here tonight . I want to see if anything more goes on , and also I want to check up on Tabor every little while . I 've talked with the doctor and the nurse , and I want to make sure that there are no mistakes made . " " You are very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what youp87are doing tonight . And also I want very much to ask you a question about something you said the other day . You saidit was possible to know the Lord Jesus Christ , now while we are living on this earth . Is n't that what you said ? " " Yes , I did , " said the young man with a sudden eager light in his eyes . " Are you interested in that ? I 'm so glad . I 've been praying that you would be . " " You have ? " exclaimed Eden eagerly . " Well , I felt as if somehow somebody was helping me , and it must have been your prayers . Thank you . But now , would you please tell me how I can get to know Christ ? I 've been to church all my life , and Sunday School , but I ca n't remember ever to have heard that question discussed . Perhaps it was my fault . Maybe I just was n't listening , or perhaps I was thinking of something else , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recall anybody telling me I could know Christ . Maybe my father just took it for granted I understood , for I 'm sure he must have known Him . " " I 'm sure he did , " said the young man solemnly with a lovely smile in his eyes , " from all I 've heard about him , and I 'm sure that he is happy to be with Him now today . I 'll be glad to tell you about it . " " Will it take long ? " asked Eden anxiously , " because I do n't want to keep you up late tonight and I can wait until some more convenient time . " " No , " said the young man , " it need n't take long , and there is no time like the present . Come sit down here by the fire and I 'll try to make it brief and clear . " Eden dropped into a low chair covered with faded blue velvet , and the firelight played over her lovely hair spinning some of it into threads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her soft cheeks . In her simple dark blue dress thatp88hung in graceful lines about her , she seemed just a lover child , yet there was in her face a mature eagerness that spurred the young man to do his best to make plain the won derful truths of eternity for her . He sat down on the other side of the fire where he could watch her , and with a quiet prayer that the Holy Spirit would guide him he began . " To begin with , " he said in a quiet voice , " I think ye ) , told me that you believed in Christ . Does that mean that you accepted Him as your own personal Saviour ? " Eden looked up shyly , perplexedly . " I do n't know , " she said . " Does it ? This book I have been reading , and perhaps only half understanding , has made me feel that I am a terrible sinner , and I never thought I was before . I thought if I just kept the Commandments , and lived as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasing to Him , and would of course belong in Heaven . But this book speaks as if everybody was a sinner , as if there were nothing pleasing to God in anybody , and it talks about Adam 's sin . I 've always heard about Adam 's sin but it never seemed to me it had anything to do with me , and now it seems to have . I am afraid I just do n't understand it at all . I am terribly confused . " " Yes ? But it is very simple after all . When God made Adam and Eve and put them in a perfect surrounding H gave them only one commandment or law : they must not eat of the tree in the midst of the garden . It was their testing . to show whether they would be willing to obey God , and choose His way . He told them if they did not obey they would bring death into the world on themselves and all their chit dren . And that first man and woman broke God 's law , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sin , so that everyone born of Adam entered the world withp89a sinful nature , a nature that wanted to please itself rather than God . That was how death came into the world through Adam . " But God loved the world , and so He made a way to be saved . He Himself , in the person of His Son Jesus Christ , came down to earth , and took a human body , and though He had no sin Himself , He took on Himself the sin of the whole world , that anyone who would believe on Him and accept what He had done for them might be saved , and be free from sin before the just God , who must keep His word , for He had said : The soul that sinneth it shall die . ' So He took the death penalty for all who would believe , and thus accept Him as Saviour . And then God raised Him from the dead as proof that He was satisfied with the atonement Christ 's blood had made . God reckons that all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when He died on the cross , and they may fully share life in His resurrection , even now in these bodies . The condition to enjoying the fulness of His life and power is that we are willing to reckon ourselves dead with Christ , saying with Paul , I am crucified with Christ ; neverthelessI live ; yet not I , but Christ liveth in me : and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God , who , loved me , and gave Himself for me . ' In that way , although we still have that sinful Adam nature which continually wants to do evil , we have also a stronger nature that is Christ 's own . As we yield to that His Holy Spirit makes us hate sin , and gives us the power to please Christ . " He looked into the sweet earnest eyes of the girl as she cagerly drank in his words , and the voice of his heart became a prayer , as he went on to speak . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather crudely told , but believe me it is true . When we have more time per/haps you will let me tell you how I came to experience the , truths in my own life , and to know that they are true , .1 .. little by little I went on to study God 's Word , and yield myscl I to Him in prayer . " God will talk with you through prayer you know , and through the reading of His Book , and you will get to knon , Him so that you will trust your life utterly to Him , and 1 willing to die to self and the desires of the flesh . That might sound like a dismal life . It would be to unbelievers , but you go on to know Him you find out that the joy of knowin : : Christ and being one with Him far outweighs any sacrific I have found it the happiest life that can be lived . Just go to Him and tell Him you accept what He has done and rest on that . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know you have had a hard day , and you ought to get some rest . ' Just then Janet appeared in the doorway . " Yer bed is riddy , Meester Lorrimer , an ' I 'm certain ye'n riddy for it . " So with a bright smile the young man turned to the girl : " Good night , " he said , giving Eden a quick handclasp . " We 'll talk again about this if you like , and  --  I 'll be praying , for you . " " Oh , thank you , " said Eden with a lovely smile . " You do n't know how you 've helped me . I think I understand , a little at least . And I do want to know Him . I really do ! " " Thank the Lord for that ! " he said fervently , and Eden went away to her rest with a warm feeling around her heartAs she lay down to rest she went over all that the young man had told her , and somehow the book she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world , and sin was in her , that is , the tendency to sin , but there was a cure for it . Christ Himself would live in her and guide her . That would bep91wonderful ! Why did nobody tell her that before ? When she understood it all she would be able to tell other people who did not know about it yet . This must be the resurrection-life that the book spoke of . It said a crucified Christian had a right to it because Christ rose from the dead . A resurrection life ! She went to sleep on that . Word about the robbery and the excitement began to get around and newspaper reporters arrived and wanted to be told everything , but Mr. Worden and Lorrimer and Mike had strictly forbidden them all to give out any information . They were just to answer , " I have nothing to say , " and refuse to let anyone talk with Eden unless it was some well-known friend she could trust . And even then they were to say nothing about the excitement . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . So Janet put the morning newspaper away out of sight , and Eden did n't think to ask for it . She came down to breakfast quite rested and ready to begin a new day . She knew there would be duties to perform . She had an appointment with Mr. Worden and the lawyer to sign some papers about the estate , and that would likely occupy a good part of the morning . Soon after breakfast two or three of her girl friends called up and said they were coming to see her right after lunch . They had just come home from extended summer vacations , and were quite eager and excited over the news they had read in the papers . Was n't it awful for her to have to go through a thing like that ? Was she much frightened ? They were most determined to get an answer even over the telephone . But Eden managed very well . " Oh yes , we had a little excitement , " she said , " but it'sp92about over now , and I believe the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'll be delighted to see you girls . " That was all , and then she turned to greet the lawyer who had arrived ahead of Mr. Worden , having refused to stay to breakfast , as he said he had some matters to attend to before he met Mr. Worden . So the two young people had a few minutes together before the conference began . The young man looked into Eden 's beautiful dark eyes and at once saw the cloud of anxiety in them . " What is it you are troubled about ? Has something happened ? " he asked in a low confidential tone . Eden flashed a quick look at him , and smiled shyly . " Why , no , nothing exactly happened , " she said hesitantly . " Some of my girl friends called up and are coming to see me this afternoon , and they are so excited about our robbery that I just know I 'm going to have a terrible time answering them . They tried to get me to talking over the telephone but I put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dreadful to refuse to tell them everything , and I do n't want to talk about it . " The young man smiled sympathetically . " No , of course not , " he said . " But I suggest you put it all in the hands of your Heavenly Guide . Just tell Him about it as you have told me , and ask Him to take over , and show you what to say and how to courteously avoid answers . I think you 'll find your worries will vanish . " " Oh , could I do that ? About just little worries like that ! Would n't He mind if I troubled Him about such trifles ? " " Of course He would not mind . Remember He has loved you and taken over your life , and shared with you His own resurrection life , and He has promised to take over everything , if you let Him live your life for you . Do n't you knowp93the verse Casting all your care upon Him for He careth for you ' ? " " Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her cheeks flushing sweetly , " why , that is wonderful ! How grand life is going to be now if I can always do that . " " You most assuredly can , " said Lorrimer , " only remember that old nature is still in you , and your enemy Satan will try to stir it up to persuade you that it is n't true . " Then the doorbell rang and Janet let in Mr. Worden and their quiet time together was over for the present But before Lorrimer went away she said in a low tone as he took his hat to leave : " Thank you so very much . You have helped me a great deal . " " I 'm glad , " he said , giving her another smile like a ray of sunshine . So Eden went into her afternoon with new strength and comfort , feeling that she had not only found a real Saviour who could give her victory over self , but she had also found a new earthly friend in her lawyer . He was somebody she would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conference with Mr. Worden was brief and friendly . She learned that Ellery Fane had not as yet been found , but that his mother had been safely placed where she could not do any harm . Court would be in session in a few days , and meantime she had been taken to the near-by county seat and taken care of until the trial . They had been looking into her case and found that both she and her son were wanted for fraudulent acts in the far West , so there was no need for further worry about any trouble from them . At least unless Ellery should turn up again , which was not likely . The telephone rang as the lawyer went back to the library to get a paper Mr. Worden wanted , and Eden went herselfp94to answer it , for Janet was busy . When she returned Lorrimer was standing in the hall waiting for Mr. Worden to answer some question of Tabor 's . Eden had come back with her face shining . " This is wonderful , " she said . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see me right away while all this excitement is so new . They would just talk and talk about it , and I did n't know how to keep them from asking questions that I 've been told not to answer . And now they have called it off themselves . They have been asked to help out getting ready for some servicemen 's party tonight , and they have to spend the whole afternoon making favors . So now by the time they do come perhaps a lot of my perplexities will be straightened out , and I wo n't find it hard to answer their questions . Besides , they will have forgotten a lot of it and wo n't be so interested by that time . " The young man 's eyes shone . " That 's it , " he said " You 'll be surprised . I 've had many experiences like that . Some of my friends when I told them about it have laughed and said it was my imagination , but you 'll find it does n't work out to be imagination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own , even in little things . " " Do you mean nothing ever happens against your wishes and prayers ? " asked Eden almost breathlessly . " Oh , no , but I mean that when you leave it all to Him He works it out marvelously . I do n't mean it always comes the way you have planned it , or want it even , but that if it does n't you know it will work out in the end to be even better than what you wanted , if you are patient and rest in Him . The condition of course is that you leave it all to Him and rest . You know His wish for you is that you shall becomep95like the Lord Jesus . Whatever hinders that , He does not allow . " " I see , " said Eden slowly , trying to think it out . " But that is almost unbelievable . It is like living a charmed life . " " Yes , is n't it ? But it is true . It is the kind of life He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " When he was gone Eden spent much time thinking over what he had said , and went shyly up to her room to pray . She had never before felt shy in approaching God , but now it seemed she had really just been introduced to Him , and was so filled with wonder and gratitude that her natural selfassuranceseemed to desert her . By and by Janet came up to tell her that the doctor had come and that he found Tabor 's condition much improved . The wound was not deep , and was doing nicely . Tabor had roused to ask once what had happened and why he was in the servant 's dining room , and then dozed off again . The doctor had said the concussion was clearing up . He hoped it would not be a long siege for him . Eden asked if she might go to him , and the doctor said yes , if he waked again , and seemed to want to see her . So toward evening when he woke and was being given nourishment , she went and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand in the old faithful one that had served her so many years , . since she was a mere baby . At her touch old Tabor opened his eyes , and smiled , perhapsthinking he might have died and this was an angel come to meet him . But when he saw her , comprehension dawned in his glance , and he smiled again , and pressed her soft fingers respectfully . " Miss Eden ! " he said , " my lady ! " and smiled again , and closed his eyes sinking away to sleep with an expression of content on his old lips.  |p96Then  Eden went up to her room again , this time to pray for Tabor . Just after dinner a neighboring woman came in for a few minutes , and brought some lovely flowers and Eden felt she should see her for a few minutes , so she came down to the little reception room near the door and thanked the woman for the flowers . " But , my dear , " purred the neighbor , " I was so horrified when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right after the sorrow of your father 's death , too . It was cruel ! Now is n't there something we could do to cheer you up ? Would n't you like to come over to our house to stay a few days until the excitement is over ? It will be quite convenient , really , and it must be so horrid to have policemen coming and going all the time . I 've seen them come in , you know . " " Oh , thank you ! That would n't be at all necessary , " she said quietly . " The policemen do n't bother me . It just seems pleasant to think they have been protecting us at night . And most of them have been friends of mine since I was a little girl . They used to direct traffic when I was on the way to kindergarten , you know , and always took my hand and led me across the street , so I know them all quite well . And besides , of course , I could n't be away anywhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could n't think of leaving for anything just now . " " But my dear ! You do n't mean to tell me that serving man is still here ? Why did n't you have him sent to the hospital at once ? That would have been the natural thing to do Surely he is well enough to be moved now ! Would you like me to call for an ambulance and arrange about his being moved ? " " Oh , no , Mrs. Mattox , " said Eden in horror . " Why ! Taborp97is a part of our family . He has been with us since I was born . I would n't think of letting him be taken away . It would grieve him terribly . He has cared for us for years , and he is very dear to me and was to my father . He is being cared for quite as well as if he were in the hospital . We have a nurse , and Janet and the other servants are much attached to him . They are all anxious to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feels he is getting on very well , and I know he 'll be happier here than anywhere else . " " Oh , but my dear , do n't be silly ! He 's only a servant . He would be very well cared for in the hospital , you know . That 's what hospitals are for . And it must be so very gloomy to have someone so ill in the house . You have to keep so still , and it must react on you . You 're looking pale , my dear . I 'm sure your father would want us all to take better care of you than to let you harbor an old worn-out servant in your home , when you must be having a hard enough time without anything more . " Eden sat up with more than her usual dignity and lifted her pretty chin . " Thank you , Mrs. Mattox , but I could n't think of having Tabor taken away , and my household arrangements are very comfortably settled . We have a good doctor you know , our old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel any responsibilityabout me . I am quite well taken care of , and I should feel very unhappy to have Tabor away . " " But that is just sentiment , my dear child ! Do n't be silly . " Eden looked up with a smile of dignity : " Sentiment is what we feel for the people who are near and dear to us , is n't it ? But it really does n't matter what you call it , Tabor stays here in his home , or what has been his home ever since I was born . But it certainly was kind of you top98bring these lovely flowers to me , Mrs. Mattox . They are beautiful . " " Well , I 'm glad you like them , " said the lady stiffly . " But I do wish you would come over , my dear . It would n't be like going out . Of course I know you do n't feel like being gay with your father just gone , but this would be just our family , and my niece , Rilla @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and you certainly would have things to talk over in common . It would be better than being all alone with just servants . " " Thank you , Mrs. Mattox , " said Eden , relieved that the lady had arisen as if about to leave . " You are most kind , but I 'm sure you will excuse me . I really do n't feel like going anywhere just now . I prefer to be at home for the present . " The woman studied her quiet poise for an instant before she finally left and when she got back to her home she remarked to her husband , " Poor child ! She seems utterly crushed . She is just determined to sit down in the dust and be gloomy . Imagine a young girl being willing to stay at home with just servants ! " But it was with a sigh of relief Eden went upstairs to pray for Tabor and his swift recovery . THE next day some of Eden 's girl friends barged inwithout warning , and Eden took them to the living room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was and he need not be disturbed by their chatter.  |p99But  at the doorway Celia Thaxter paused and looked across at the great vase of flowers on the table under the opposite window . " Oh ! Funeral flowers ! " she exclaimed with a shudder . " Have they kept all this time ? Why on earth do n't you throw them out ? I just hate the thought of flowers in connection with a funeral , do n't you ? I think it would be so much better if they could completely break down that idea of sendingflowers to a funeral . I always appreciate it when the death notices have the request No flowers please . ' Flowers seem so out of place when one is in trouble , do n't you think ? " Eden gave Celia a wondering look , and caught her breath . How could she talk that way ? " Why no , " she said brightly , " I think flowers are the most wonderful conveyors of sympathy , and I 'm always grateful for them . But Celia , those are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mattox my neighbor brought over to me last night . Are n't they lovely ? Come in , wo n't you ? Take that chair over by the desk , Celia . It 's my favorite chair . " " No thanks , " said Celia shivering a trifle . " I 'll sit right here by the door . Was n't this the room you had the funeral in ? I thought so . Why do n't we go into the library ? I always loved that room . " " I 'm sorry , " said Eden coolly , " but it 's right across from the servants ' dining room where we had to take Tabor when he was brought in , and I 'm afraid our talking might annoy him . He 's still in a very critical state . " " Tabor ! " exclaimed the visitor . " You do n't mean to tell me you kept him here ? After he was stabbed ? He was stabbed , was n't he ? How perfectly dreadful ! Why Eden , who suggested that ? The doctor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a servant , is n't he ? The very idea of your keeping himp100in the living part of your house where your friends have to come . Hospitals are for such cases ! That 's what we give all those fairs and teas for , to get money to have free beds for the poor . You could have even paid his way yourself if you felt all that obligation to a mere servant . " " I preferred to have Tabor here , " said Eden haughtily . " This is his home and he has been our faithful friend through the years . Would you like a cushion , Celia ? That chair is rather deep . " " No thanks ! I 'll make out . But you certainly are keeping up your old college character of being queer ! The idea ! A servant having all the attention a member of the family would have ! " " Tabor is a member of the family , " said Eden definitely . " But who takes care of him ? Not you , I hope . I should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the servants to look after him , and I should n't suppose they would be willing to do it anyway . " " Any one of our servants would be entirely willing to go out of their way and work overtime if they could help Tabor . They all honor and love him greatly . But of course we have a nurse . " " A nurse ? Oh ! That 's different of course , but it must make a lot more work for the other servants . Who pays for the nurse ? " " Celia , for heaven 's sake , mind your own business , ca n't you ? " protested Mary Carter . " I am minding my business . I think it 's our business to protect Eden from imposition ! " But Eden did not answer . Instead she turned toward the other girls . " Is your aunt any better , Carolyn ? " she asked  | " Oh , I guess so , " said Carolyn Craton indifferently . " She does n't whine around quite so much . I certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bother other people with it . It is n't our fault she has asthma . My dad has kept us all poor sending her around from one doctor to another and I do n't think it 's fair to the rest of us . " Eden turned to Mary Carter : " Has your brother come home yet from the Philippines ? " she asked brightly . " Not yet . He stopped on the way to visit his fiancee . They 're going to be married at Christmas . Just think of it . We 're all going out there to the wedding . I think it is horrid . Spoils Christmas for me all right . In fact I 'm not even sure I 'm going . There are seven parties here at home and I 'm invited to every one of them . Can you beat that , girls ? And what they want to have their old wedding at Christmas for I do n't understand . They 're just cutting themselves out of a whole holiday every year . They ca n't celebrate a wedding and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I may decide to take the midnight train home after the wedding and get back in time for three of the parties , anyway . Though if I do that I 'll miss out on the western trip dad was going to stake us all to . I am not sure what I 'm going to do . " Then the whole group began to advise Mary , one said come home , and one said take the western trip . " Oh , but you 'd better come home , Mary . You do n't know who 's going to be here , perhaps Caspar Carvel ! Imagine that ! His buddie in the army wrote my cousin Catharine about it . They say he 's perfectly striking looking , and he looks swell in his uniform . I think it 's horrid they are going to have to give up their uniforms when they are dischargedp102from service , do n't you ? They look so much handsomer in them than in civilian clothes . " They chattered on in the old way about their boy and girl friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eden caught her breath and began to look troubled . Was Caspar coming back to make her trouble ? Till suddenly she remembered her new life , and that this was something more she could trust to her Guide . A quick prayer in her heart " Please take over , Lord ! " and her brightness returned . " I suppose you know all about Caspar , of course , Eden , " said the fourth girl . " You always did . But I imagine you 'll have some competition from now on . They say he 's much improved , and simply stunningly handsome . Looks swell in his uniform and all that , and is perfectly spiffy in his manner . They say the army has done him all kinds of good . Taken away that goody-goody attitude he had . He is n't a sissy any more . He used to be such a lily , but he 's all over that . I can testify that he can swear in a regular way now , just like the toughest guy in the camp . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a thing like war has either one effect or the other on those who take part in it . " They looked at her in astonishment . The girl who had told this had expected to horrify little quiet Eden , but here she was taking it as if she expected something like this . The others were looking curiously at Eden . " You and Caspar used to be awfully good friends , did n't you ? " asked Celia meditatively . " You used to be pretty thick , I remember . " Eden looked up and smiled quietly . " When we were children , " she said . " You know he lived the second house below us . But I have n't known much about him lately . "  | " Oh , but surely you 've been writing to him and he to you , every mail that crossed the ocean in his direction . Now do n't try to deny that , for nobody here will believe it . " This from Celia again . " No , " said Eden quietly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was almost amusement on her face . " We have n't been corresponding at all . I think he wrote a letter when he first went over and then he got interested in other things . You know our acquaintance was a mere schoolmate affair , and never meant anything to either of us . But I really have n't been writing to any soldiers during this war . Father has been rather ill you know , and I was with him all the time . I helped him with business letters and a lot of routine work , and had no time for personal letters at all . And even if I had n't been more than usually busy I 'm not sure that I would have been interested in writing to Caspar . As we grew up I think we rather grew away from each other . We did n't always see things in the same way . " " Oh , but that 's too bad , Eden , " said Mary Carter . " You always looked so swell together . You made a stunninglookingcouple and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometime as soon as Cappie got home from service . It really is a shame to break that up . Such a swell-looking couple ! " Eden laughed amusedly . " That 's scarcely a reason for selecting a life companion , is it ? " she asked with a grim little twinkle about her mouth . " But you 'll have to change the pattern of your imaginings . There is not the slightest possibility that this one will ever happen . " " But Eden , you 'll come to our little party , wo n't you ? " pleaded Carolyn . " It really would n't be complete without you ,  |p104and  will just spoil it for us all . You are n't such a stickler for convention . It 's to be a very quiet affair , strictly for the service boys , and no one would think it out of good form for you to come with us and help . Even people who are closer to a family death than you are would think it is all right . Anything you do for the servicemen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is patriotic besides , you understand , and that is even greater than a religious reason , is n't it ? " " Is it ? " asked Eden lifting her delicate eyebrows . " Why ? " " Oh , mercy ! Eden , you do n't mean you do n't believe in being patriotic , do you ? " " Oh no , " said Eden . " Of course it is right to be patriotic , but it rather amused me to hear it compared in that way , putting it ahead of religion . " " But do n't you , Eden ? Do n't you think patriotism is the greatest thing on earth ? I think patriotism is religion . It is religion made practical . It is religion being lived . Do n't you see , Eden ? " said Mary Carter . " Well , I suppose it ought to be , but it seems to me that a lot of the things some people call patriotism is just doing what everybody else is trying to do ; only everyone is doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I do n't think you ought to talk that way . See how everybody is sending Christmas boxes to soldiers . Do n't you think that is religion , Eden Thurston ? " said Carolyn . " Why , no , not exactly , " said Eden . " It 's doing a kind act to give the people they love and a few others a pleasant taste of home , but that is not exactly what I call religion . In a way it 's the outcome of religion . But real religion is trying to make other people understand what a wonderful God we have , and how He died to save us , and how He wants us to live , our self lives surrendered to Him . Dying with Him to sin , sop105that we might have a right to His risen life . I 've been interested in studying that . But of course I believe in sending Christmas boxes and all that . Say , Florence , did your sister get home from Italy ? She was a WAC , was n't she ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got married before she came , so she has a home of her own now and we do n't see her much any more . But say , I think it 's going to be very exciting , having all these servicemen home to our Christmas party . You 'll come , wo n't you , Eden ? There 's no real reason why you should n't , is there ? Nobody will think it queer . Your father was always one to want to help every good work . " " I 'm not sure I can , " said Eden . " I 'll see how our invalid is by that time . " " But surely you would n't stay away because of a mere servant , would you ? " " That depends on how he is , " said Eden smiling . " But say , girls , I have a box of the most delicious chocolates here , the best I 've been able to get all summer . Do n't you want some ? Wait ! I 'll get the box . " Eden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of candy which one of her friends had sent in to her . And so with delicious bits of confection they sat and talked , and now they turned to the present-day news . " Say , girls , " said Florence Holmes , " there are some perfectlyspiffy men coming back , and they 're not all of them married either . There 's a young minister over at the First Avenue church . They say he 's very eloquent , and he has stacks of good stories about the war . It seems he was a chap-lain . " " Oh , a chaplain ! " sneered Celia . " I could n't be bothered to go out gunning for him . It would bore me to death . Religionagain . Eden , you 'd better turn your talents toward him . He might just fit in with your ideas . "  | " Sorry , " smiled Eden , " I 'm afraid I do n't want anybody I have to go out gunning for . That would n't be my idea of a good start in life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go out and drag them in , " said Carolyn . " She has them all provided for her . Look at the new lawyer her old guardian has just taken over . Girls , have you seen him ? He 's stunningly good-looking , and they say he 's not only handsome but awfully clever . I give you fair notice , Eden , I 'm going out for that Mr. Lorrimer , and you need n't say that he belongs to you for I wo n't take no for an answer . My dad says that he 's the brightest man he 's seen in an age , and he 'll make his mark in the world before long and do n't you forget it . Here 's where I give notice that I 've picked him out . " " I 'll bet Eden has n't even seen the gentleman , " said Mary Carter . " She has n't entered the warpath yet . Give her a couple of years more and she 'll wake up and take notice . " " It will be too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eligible ones will be married by that time . She 'll have to take up with some divorced guy , or a widower with seven children . " Eden was smiling at their jokes , and trying to keep back her indignation at some of the things they said , but she kept her poise , and said very little . " Have you met this Lorrimer fellow yet ? " asked Mary Carter , looking her straight in the eye , and hoping to make her change color , but Eden kept on smiling . " Oh , yes , " she said quite casually . " He 's very pleasant . " " Is he married yet ? Or engaged ? " asked Carolyn eagerly . " Why no , I do n't think so . But of course I did n't ask him , " she finished amusedly . " Well , I do n't think you were very clever if you could n't find out in one interview , " said Celia . " Me , I always knowp107at once . They bear the stamp right on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; widower . A really smart girl can tell . " " Why bother ? " asked Eden amusedly . " Eventually you 'll find out if you 're interested . And after all young men are n't the only interest in life . What are you all aiming to be ? Businesswomen , artists , writers , poets , doctors or lawyers ? " The girls groaned in chorus . " What do you think we are ? " they said . " We 're out for a good time . The war has been bad enough while it lasted , though at least it was exciting , and you never knew whom or what you would meet next . But as for settling down into a businesswoman or a doctor or a lawyer , I 'm not interested . It would bore me to extinction , " said Mary . " What are you going to be , Eden ? " " I 'm not sure yet , " said Eden thoughtfully . " I think I 'm going to wait until God shows me what He is planning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an awkward silence , the room filled with embarrassment . " Oh , heavens ! " said Celia . " Girls , do you know what time it is ? If we do n't go this minute we 'll be late for that train the two marines are coming on . Want to go with us , Eden ? " Eden smiled . " No thank you , I believe not , " she said . " I promised to help Janet for a few minutes , and I thought I would sit with Tabor for a little while if he is awake . Come and see me again , girls , and thank you for all the pleasant gossip . I find I was rather behind the times with some of it . " " Well , you 're a dear , anyway , " said Mary Carter , " even if you are terribly puritanical . " " Well , I guess it takes all kinds of people to make up ap108world , " said Carolyn . " But say , Eden , why ca n't you  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little so nobody 's formal ideas will be shocked  --  have a little party and somehow manage to get hold of that young lawyer Mr. Worden has with him . Invite us all , so we can meet him ? I 've really quite A crush on him . I could go for him in a big way . " Eden smiled gently . " I 'm sorry , Carolyn , " she said pleasantly , " but I really could n't do anything like that . Not now anyway . But I 'll be glad to introduce you if I happen to be around when you meet him . Of course I 've met him on business . " " Oh , my goodness , Eden , how do you manage to be so calm and collected about everything ? Do n't you ever get a crush on anybody ? " Eden really laughed then . " Why , perhaps I did when I was a kid , " she said . " I just do n't remember . But after all , " she laughed , " I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , and I suppose I 'm growing up . " " Oh , " laughed Celia , " I hope it 's not that bad . Be your age , girl , and do n't let a few troubles get you down . If you do you 'll get old before your time , and life is n't so awfully gay that you can afford to pass up a good-looking young man . " Celia went over to the mirror , fluffed up her hair , got out her compact and touched up her lips and complexion . Then she turned back with even a more insolent expression on her face than before . On the whole Eden was glad when the crowd left , and she could draw a long breath and relax a little . Then she hurried back to see how Tabor was , and found that he was better , was lying there quite comfortably , with somewhat of the old expression on his face . That was a relief , though he was stillp109very weak . He had lost a good deal of blood from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But his concussion was clearing up nicely , and they had pretty well calmed his mind about lying in the servants ' dining room and being waited on , when he had always for so many years waited on other people . But his eyes lighted happily when he saw Eden . " So sorry ! " he murmured . " Make  --  so  --  much  --  trouble ! " " Oh , " laughed Eden happily , " that 's all right , Tabor . We 're glad to have a chance to get it back on you a little for all the years you 've waited on us , and I 'm quite sure I 've made you a lot of trouble ever since I was born . So I 'll be happy if I , or we , can do a little something for you . You 've been wonderful to us all these years , Tabor , and wonderful to my dear father . I 'm so glad you are feeling a little better . We hope you will soon be well again . But meantime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helper , and everything will soon be all right again . " Tabor smiled . " Meh lady , you have  --  always  --  been  --  a dear child ! I am honored , " and the look he gave her was a heartening cheer to her lonely young heart . The next day Tabor was so much better that the doctor let Mike come to talk with him a few moments and ask him a few questions . Ellery was being searched for most carefully , and the authorities were anxious to talk with Tabor to see what his testimony would be . " It was Ellery Fane all right , " said Tabor , rousing at the question , and speaking slowly . " I only caught one full glimpse of his face . Then  --  it all  --  went dark  --  and that sharp pain in my back ! But it was Ellery , and I heard him say he was going to  --  kill me ! " The doctor was standing by , and signed top110Mike that was enough , so Mike said , " Okay , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling better . So long ! " and the session ended . But the search went on , extending over even wider territory as time went on . Then old friends began more and more to run in to see Eden . Girls she had known all her life . Some brought real joy and comfort and some were unpleasant developments of the modern times . There were only a few that Eden really enjoyed . But much of her time was taken up helping to make the hours pass pleasantly for the old servant . She discovered that Tabor liked to have her read to him . He even asked for a chapter in the Bible Sunday morning and thanked her gratefully when she had finished . And then one day after consultation with the doctor , she took her little radio down beside Tabor 's bed and turned on a Christian song service , and the light in his old eyes showed that he fairly felt he was in Heaven . It was while this was going on one afternoon that Mrs. Rollin Sturtevant came to call , just a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father she meant it to be , for she had been away on a trip when he died . But she sat in the little reception room by the front door and waited all of five minutes while Eden was finding the right station for Tabor to listen to . Then Eden hurried up the hall and came in to welcome her infrequent caller . " Oh , my dear , did I interrupt you in something ? " she asked as she arose to greet Eden . " Oh , no , " said Eden smiling . " I was just finding the right station on the radio for Tabor to listen to the music . He 's very fond of the hymn-singing hour . " " Hymns ! How terrible ! I should think that would be sop111gruesome ! Are n't you afraid you 'll make him morbid ? And he ought to have some consideration for you , asking for that sort of thing . You ca n't help hearing it all over the house . " " Oh , but we love it , all of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't see how anybody would become morbid with hymns . Wo n't you sit over here , Mrs. Sturtevant ? This chair is much more comfortable than the one in which you were sitting . You 've been on a trip , have n't you ? I suppose you had a lovely time . " " Oh , yes , well enough , though we had to spend so much time waiting for trains even when we had reservations . They just would n't let us get on our train sometimes , because they had so many of those service boys to take . I declare I do n't see why they had to favor them so much . After all , the war is over and they are getting home , are n't they ? They ought to be glad to have to wait a little when they know that . They do n't own the earth do they , even if they did go off to fight . And of course you know those boys wanted to go ? Most of them would have been broken-hearted if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little honest work . But really , Eden , I was ashamed that I had to be away at the time of your father 's funeral . And I did n't know of it until it was too late even to wire flowers . " " Oh , do n't think of that , Mrs. Sturtevant . It was perfectly understandable of course when you were away , and especially at this time , with a war just over . But I do n't think we ought to begrudge anything to those wonderful boys . And I know they were crazy to get home , and their people were so glad to have them coming . " " Well , " said the caller , " from what I 've seen of them they 're the most ill-mannered set . They think they can do simply anything just because they wear a uniform . But all I can sayp112is I 'm heartily glad I never had any sons to send out to war . " " Yes . It must have been pretty hard for the mothers to let them go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoughtfully , feeling sorry also for any sons that might have belonged to this woman . " Well , I suppose some of them felt that way , " begrudged the woman , " but after all they might have died if they had stayed at home . Some do , you know , without even the glory of medals and ribbons and all that . However , I 'm glad this war craze is supposed to be over , and I hope now we 'll b ( able to get a few of the necessities of life . Why , I tried to get some hemstitched linen sheets at the store yesterday , where I 've always bought them , and do you know , I could n't get a single sheet anywhere , not even a cotton one . At last I went to a very exclusive shop in one of our best suburbs and found some cotton ones and said I 'd take two dozen , and do you know what the salesperson told me ? She said they were not allowed to sell but one pair to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me and she bought a pair too and gave them to me , so I got four . But imagine it ! I really do n't believe inwar , do you ? " Eden smiled . " I guess nobody believes in war except the people who want to conquer the world , do they ? But I 'm glad it 's over of course . " " Yes , of course you are . Did you have a young sweetheart in the war , my dear ? I feel it must have been so hard for the dear girls who had to say good-by and not know whether the boys were ever coming back . It must have been worse for the girls , and young things that got married in a hurry . Did you have a sweetheart over there ? " Eden 's eyes fairly twinkled.  | " No , " she said laughing a sweet little ripple of a laugh , " I had lots of old friends and schoolmates of course , but no sweethearts . I have n't ever had time yet to think about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said the honeyed reproving voice of the caller . " Well , be thankful you did n't . The world 's all before you now and you can take your time to pick and choose . Now , I really must be getting home . I have an appointment with a new dressmaker . Such a pity we ca n't get our old stand-bys . My old dressmaker who always made all repairs and adjustmentshas gone into defense work , and is getting some fabulous slim every week . I declare I think it 's a crime the wages they paid during the war . But they 'll soon find out that wo n't keep up , and then they 'll go whining around for jobs , and nobody will want them back . Well , good-by , and do run over , dear , when you get lonely and want cheering up . I 'll be glad to take you over and entertain you . Call me up sometime and let me know when you can come . " " Thank you , " said Eden coolly , " but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't get lonely much , only of course I miss my father . Good-by and thank you for coming . " When the door closed on the voluble woman at last Janet emerged from the shadows of the hall with pitying eyes . " Ye poor lamb ! " she said gently . " Oh , Janet , " said Eden throwing her arms around the kind old nurse , putting her head down on the sympathetic shoulder . " Oh , Janet , how many more of these will there be ? Will every woman on this street think she has to call on me ? This one was terrible . She did n't believe in anything , except what was for herself . " " Yes , my lamb . Thur 's a ' molly like thet ! " said Janet soothingly . " Noo , come awa ' tae the lib'ry an ' have a bite tae eat ,  |p114an  ' a wee drap o ' tay . I 've made soom hot scones ! An ' the  --  ye ken say good night tae Tabor . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her tea and scones and then went and read Tabor his good night psalm , and left him with a smile of peace on his old lips . Eden was very happy that night as she went to her room to read for a little while , and just before nine o'clock there came a telephone call for her from Lorrimer . " Good evening , " he said . " This is your lawyer . Do you remember him ? I 've been away to Chicago on business for the bank , or I should have called before , but how are you fixed for tomorrow evening ? Are any guests coming ? " " Not that I know of , " said Eden , thinking of Mrs. Sturtevant , and sincerely hoping there would be no more such callers . " Well , there is going to be a meeting in town tomorrow evening and a very great Bible teacher is going to speak . I thought of you at once when I heard of it . I wondered if you would care to go with me to hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Eden . " How wonderful ! " After she had hung up the receiver she went down the hall to Janet 's room . " Janet , I 'm going out tomorrow evening to a wonderful Bible meeting , with Mr. Lorrimer . So if anybody calls up and tells you they are coming to see me tomorrow night you can tell them I shall not be at home . " " Thet will be wonner'fu ' ! " declared Janet . " I 'm glad he asked ye . I ken he 's a gude mon . " So both Eden and Janet slept well that night.  |p115THE  next day went on very happily in pleasant routine , with Tabor hourly showing improvement , and the doctor well pleased with the result of his treatment . Eden went through the day much cheered in heart , able to put aside the neat loneliness that so often surged over her as she remembered that her dear father was gone from her . About five o'clock in the afternoon there came a telephone call from Caspar Carvel , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She wished she had asked Janet to answer the telephone . Janet would have settled him . And yet she realized that after all it was her question to settle . " Yes ? " she answered in a cool impersonal voice , not at all as if she joyfully recognized him . " Hello , Beautiful ! " he addressed her , as of old , and waited an instant for a friendly sign , but Eden gave no friendly sign . " Yes ? " she said questioningly . " Is this Caspar ? " There was an instant 's silence and then the young man tried again . " Yes , Eden . I want to come and see you this evening . " " That will be impossible , " she answered with finality . " I have an engagement for the evening . " " Well , then let me come now . I want to apologize for what I did the other night . I 've got some time off , unexpectedly . I find I 'm not satisfied until I make it right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " There was a note of pleading in his voice . " Let me come over to dinner and we can talk while we are eating . I ca n't be satisfied until I have made it right with you . "  |p116Eden  was still a moment and then said gravely : " I 'm afraid you ca n't do that by any talking , Caspar . You dishonored my father , and you spoke with contempt of my God . Those are not little things to be lightly forgiven . " There was silence for a moment , what seemed almost like astonished silence , then the young man spoke again , almost humbly this time . " I realize that I spoke carelessly , Eden , and I ought not to have done it . You know I 've been away from home in a wild environment and I just got into the habit of speaking care lessly the way the others do . I want to talk it over and make you understand that I did n't mean any harm . Let me come over to dinner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is quite impossible , Caspar . I 'm going to be away for dinner and will probably be out late tonight . Besides , it 's time you understood that you can not dishonor a man who has always been your friend , and blaspheme the God in whom I believe , and then expect to make everything right by a little talk . " " Well , ca n't you call off your other engagement and give me the evening ? " " No , " said Eden with finality , " not even if I wanted to , which I do not . " " Oh , say now , kid ! That 's not like you ! " " No ? " said Eden . " Well , neither was blasphemy and irreverencelike what you used to be when you were a boy . But you 'll have to excuse me now . I must go . " " Aw , Eden ! Old friend ! Do n't be like that ! Well , say , then , if I ca n't come tonight how about tomorrow night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I go back to camp , or I 'll just about go to the dogs , and you 'll be responsible . You do n't want that do you , Lovely ? "  | " I do n't believe that I would be in the least responsible , " said Eden coldly . " But if it will do you any good you may come over tomorrow evening about nine o'clock for half an hour . I really ca n't spare any more time . Good night ! " and Eden hung up on the astonished young egotist . But after she had hung up she was troubled . Why did this have to happen on this day that had been so happy ? And had she done right to let him come at all ? Yet it had seemed rather awful , too , to refuse to let him apologize . Well , she had at least put it off until tomorrow night , but she dreaded to have it to look forward to . She wished she might have this one evening free from worry . Then she remembered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Could she leave this also to her new Lord ? So when she went up to her room to get ready for the evening she knelt by her bed and said softly : " Dear Lord , here is something again that I do n't know how to manage , and ca n't do anything about . Wo n't You please take over , and help me to trust it utterly to You ? Show me just what to say and do . " Then she arose with a lighter heart and went about dressing . She was a bit puzzled for a moment what she should wear . Her father had never liked the idea of wearing mourning for the Christian dead . She had no black dresses that were suitable for the occasion , anyway . So she settled on a simple suit of very dark green wool , and a little felt hat with dark plumes to match , that curled about the brim , and softly touched her hair . There was nothing noticeable about her costume , yet she was looking very beautiful , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she came down the stairs . That look in his eyes made her feel as if he , too , were glad to be going out with her . Made her feel just happy and relieved . And ap118sudden thought that her father would have approved of this evening 's plan warmed her heart , and helped her to forget Caspar Carvel and his intended call . The young lawyer had brought his own car to take this : little new lady out . It was n't an expensive make , but it was a good reliable car , and Eden was never critical of cars . Tabor had always been their driver when she and her father went out , or when she went out alone , and she had heard little discussion of makes and models of cars . Her education had not been along such lines . To tell the truth , even if the car had been of a very inferior make Eden would have been inclined to admire it because it was owned by Lorrimer , although she had no idea whatever that her mind was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to which they went was a very large one , located in a popular part of the city , and the crowd which was already gathering when they arrived gave promise of being a capacity audience . They found a seat near the front . Eden looked around on the audience in amazement . There were a great many young people present , both young men and girls , and many of the men were still in service uniform . Somehow she had not expected to see any young people . She had n't realized that young people were interested in religious things . And there was another surprising fact : there were also a great many distinguished-looking men present , of all ages . Some of the men she had met , with her father . Three of these latter were on the platform , and seemed to be going to take a part in the service . Her escort presently pointed out the principal speaker of the evening , about whom he had been telling her on their drive down to the city . He was a fine , distinguished-looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognized that at once . There was a twinkle in his eyes when he looked up and smiled at someone that showed he had a real sense of humor . Eden studied him while the people were coming in , and while her escort was talking with a man who sat in front of them , and evidently knew the lawyer well . But aside from the few elderly men who had been her father 's friends , she knew scarcely anyone in the audience . Then when the choir of young people marched in and filled the gallery behind the platform , she studied them . They looked like interesting boys and girls , most of them very young looking , with here and there a serviceman or girl . The organist was a distinguished musician , and it was a joy to hear him play , but Eden was surprised to notice that in place of the usual formal church music there was much mingling of church hymns and even a gospel song or two . It was then that Eden began to realize that this was a different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't just a formal church service , it was more like a gathering of people who really loved God , and loved one another . It was a sort of heavenly fellowship gathering ; she could imagine that Heaven would be something like this . Suddenly she looked up at Lorrimer and saw that he was watching her , and their eyes met in a lovely smile , as if he had understood her thoughts . She drew in a quick breath of delight . She had never known a fellowship like this , and found herself wishing that her father could be there too . Then came the thought that perhaps he was able to look down and see her there and if that was possible she knew he would be glad of her presence there . The music was very fine , but with no emphasis on its brilliancy . The solos made the words a sermon , and the prayerp120was tender and moving . Then the speaker was introduced , and from the first word Eden was thrilled . " They tell us the war is over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still in a war with sin . We have been in a gay and happy mood , getting ready to lay down our implements of warfare , and beat our swords into plowshares and our spears into pruning hooks , ' get rid of rationing , buy all the beefsteak and gas we want , and have a good time . We go to church on Sunday , and sit back contented in what we choose to believe is an atmo. phere of peace , and we like to try and think that there will never be a war again . " But the Christian church is in a warfare today , only on warfare is in the spirit realm , not in the natural . Not agains , i flesh and blood . The Christian has been delivered from the natural realm , delivered from self : good self , bad self , religions self , and all the other kinds of self . He has been brought into another sphere , and it is in that sphere he must live and wage his warfare . We must combine our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And one of the first things we need to realize is that we can not make a single move without orders from on high . " We are fighting one of the battles in the great war against the enemy , and we are a spectacle not only for the world to see , but also for the angels . They are watching us there on the ramparts of Heaven , and Christian warfare , in order to be effective , must be fought from a Heavenly standpoint , and not from the earthly or carnal standpoint . That being the ca , e we can not use carnal weapons and devices , such as human organizations and businesslike schemes the world would use . If we do we 're neglecting the spiritual , and losing the power that is of God . There must be spiritual warfare on spiritualp121ground with spiritual weapons , or else we are defeated at the start . " We are here as a church to take the prey out of the hands of the evil one , that sinners may be saved , saints @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our Lord Jesus Christ in glory and power . " The very moment Christians get to warring with one another the church is divided , and we are defeated . The very moment Christians get into a state of judging or criticizing one another with bitterness and unforgiveness toward one another , they are not only defeated in their own lives , but other people are defeated by their influence , and the devil is well pleased . He knows very well that if he can get the church of God to warring with one another they will not war against him . That is why so many prayers by Christians who are judging and criticizing one another are not answered , and why so many lose the sweet experiences God wants them to have . " God wants you to go after sinners , to be loving and patient with saints , and if you are sharp and censorious you will only drive them away from God instead of winning them . God wants you to show by your life that He has done something in your life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and given you His own life and His own patience and grace . There are worldly Christians who have no power in their lives . But when you walk with God , and His Holy Spirit has His way with you every step of the way , then He will give you power and answer your prayers . Before you go out to battle get down upon your knees and ask God to show you yourselves . Then examine your weapons . Be sure they are not carnal weapons . " Long ago when Babylon had sinned and the Lord was going to destroy it , He raised up the spirit of the Medes top122destroy it for Him , and He told them to get ready their weapons , to be sure there was no rust upon them , to sharpen them to work effectually : Make bright the arrows ; gather the shields , ' He said , because it is the vengeance of the Lord , the vengeance of His temple . ' " And today when God calls His saved ones to battle against Satan and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole armour of God . ' But today it is not material weapons we have to sharpen and make bright and ready , but the spiritual armour . Among those are mentioned the sword of the Spirit , which is the Word of God . ' And above all prayer . ' Then go forth and prove that spiritual weapons are mighty to the pulling down of strongholds . And remember that not only men and devils are watching you , but angels are watching also , and rejoicing over your victories . " When the service was out Eden was introduced to a number of the young people and she promised to come to some of thei other meetings . Her eyes were shining with new pleasure as they finally said good night and started away . They stopped on the way for ice cream in a quiet little place where there was opportunity to talk . " Well , how did you like the speaker ? " asked the young man , watching Eden earnestly . " Oh , so much ! " she said . " It seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoughts and worries and knew just how to answer them . He really told me how to get ready foi something I very much dread , and now I 'll go home and make my arrows bright for what is ahead tomorrow night . " " Oh , " said Lorrimer , thinking what a quick young mind , and what a willing heart this was , " are you having a battle on tomorrow night ? " " I 'm afraid so , " sighed Eden . " Oh , it 's nothing I suppose , but it rather frightens me to think that I may not say the rightp123thing . He said the sword of the Spirit was the Word of God , and I 'm afraid I do n't know that Word as well as I should to use it as a weapon . " " I see , " said the young man appreciatively . " Of course that is the advantage of Spirit-guided study of the Bible . But if you are Spirit-led He will show you what to say . " " But , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think I could be guided definitely ? " " You certainly can , definitely , " said the young man earnestly . " You have given yourself into His keeping . You can trust Him utterly . I know for I have tried it . You tried it too , just the other day . If you can trust Him with little trifles , can you not trust Him with the great things of life ? If you can not , then He is not a Saviour . He has promised if you died with Him , you can have that resurrection life that He brought you when He rose from the dead . " Eden looked up into his eyes and a great joy came into her face . " Oh , " she said . " Yes , I can trust Him . Thank you . " They went out to the car then , and did not talk any more about it till he took her home . Then just as he said good night he added in a low tone : " And I 'll be praying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her prayers might be crude and very new before the great God , even if He did love her , but his prayers would reach to the throne . He was used to praying for things and getting them . Janet came hurrying from the telephone to meet her . " It was that little r-r-rat on the wire , " she said , " him as was here before . He wanted tae ken , was ye hame yet , an ' whan did I expict ye . I said I dinna ken yer business , an ' he said , ' Tell her I 'll be there bright an ' early t'morra night . ' " " Yes , " sighed Eden uncertainly , " he 's coming again , Janet.  |p124I  had to say yes . He said he wanted to apologize . But you need n't worry . I 'm not going anywhere with him . " " He 's nae fit fer ye tae wipe yer pretty feet on , " said Janet fiercely . " That 's all right , Janet . I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have to be courteous even if he was n't . I have to accept his apology . But there I stop . " " Boot he 'll try his verra best tae get in wi ' ye agin , an ' be the same of frind . He has a way wi ' him . He 'll make ye feel he 's better than he is . He 'll tell ye it 's yer dooty tae be his frind . " " No , Janet , he 'll not do that . Not this time . I think I 've learned my lesson . I know what he is . I must see him tomorrow night , but after this he 's just a boy I used to know when we were children . That 's all ! " Janet looked after her sorrowfully as she started up the stairs and brushed a glittering tear away from her eyes , as Eden threw her a lovely smile . " Weel , Oim sure I hoop yer richt ! " she said with a doubtful sigh , and turned away quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in much the same way he hadalways done in the years gone by , much as if the housewere his own old home and he had a right there . As if therewere nothing special due for the privilege of coming . Onewould never have known from the quality of his regular oldtimegrin that he had come to apologize for anything . Andp125Eden , whose quick eyes had noted this at once , felt her former anger rising , because she could not seem to forget the insolent words he had spoken . But she had spent time on her knees , with her Bible open before her , and had definitely put the matter in her new Master 's hands . She felt assured that He would make it plain how she was to deal with this . " Hi , there , Beautiful ! " he began . " At last my perseverance is rewarded by your worthy presence ! You certainly have taken on an air of discipline and distance . What 's the little old idea , anyway , Lovely ? " Eden did not respond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went quietly , sweetly about the duties of a hostess , utterly ignoring his question . " Good evening ! " she said coolly as if it were a stranger she was greeting . " Wo n't you sit down ? " She motioned toward a straight chair and went herself toward another at a little distance . Caspar stood surveying her , a mask of puzzlement on his brow . So , she really must have been angry at what he had said on his last visit . But he slid down on the chair she had indicated and turned to her a puzzled grieved expression as if he did not understand . " But what 's the little old idea , Ede , " he complained . " Why the frigidity ? " " I beg your pardon , Caspar . I understood you came here to make apology for your remarks the last time you were here . " " Oh , that ! Why Baby ! You 're not mad yet , are you ? You knew I did n't mean what I said . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Eden quietly , with sweet dignity . " Aw , now , Baby ! Do n't get that way ! You ought to know me better than that . You know I 'm awfully fond of you . Ip126would n't hurt you for the world . I just took it for granted that you had grown up to the times , and would understand . Why , excuse me , Baby , but you do n't seem to have changed at all . 1 suppose your father 's sickness has kept you cooped up away from the world . You do n't seem to know times have changed . " " I certainly realize that you have changed , " said Eden , still speaking quietly , and with gentle dignity . " Hi , there , Eden , " said the young man , " wake up and be yourself . You certainly ca n't think you 're being attractive carrying on a line like that . " " I was not trying to be attractive , " she said , " but I am wondering if this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put on another act of hurt dignity . " Apology ? Oh ! Why yes , sure I said I would apologize if that is what you want . I sure want to make it right between us old friends , and come here the way I used to do . I shall be mustering out pretty soon , and I want to get things on a friendly plane again . Sure ! " and he suddenly sprang to his feet and putting his hand on his stomach made a low abject bow . " So , I most humbly apologize . " Eden watched him a moment as he slowly raised his head and gave her an assured smile as if he felt he had done a good job of apology . Then she said gravely : " Sit down , Caspar , and listen to me . You have n't made an apology at all . You do n't even think you have done anything to apologize for . You are not sorry for what you said , you know you are not . And as for things being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can never be . " " But what did I do , tell me , kiddo ! I really do n't under-stand . " But Eden looked steadily at him . " Yes , you understand , Caspar . You spoke of my father in anp127outrageous way , and you spoke of my God in a terrible way . " " Oh , well , kid , I supposed of course you 'd understand I was n't saying anything dreadful about your father . He was just an old man , rather behind the times of course , but nothing to his discredit . You see I did n't really intend any discourtesy to him . And as for the other matter , Eden , you do n't really mean to tell me you still believe in all that sentiment about God . Why simply nobody believes that any more . " " I do ! " said Eden firmly . " And I resent any word said against my God and my Christ . You see I know Him . He is not only my Saviour , but He is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you will have to apologize if you want to be my friend . " " Great day ! " said the affected youth , " is it that bad with you ? Why , you 're crazy , Eden . " " You 're worse than crazy , Caspar . I 'm very much afraid you are lost . The Bible says : For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness ; but unto us which are saved it is the power of God . ' " The young man stared . " Who put you up to saying a thing like that ? " he asked with a sneer . " That 's terrific ! " " Nobody put me up to saying anything . I asked God to show me what to say to you , and this is the verse He directed my attention to . Of course I had read it before , but I felt you ought to know it was there , and that God understands all about you . " Caspar stared again , and then with an impatient gesture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were also superstitious as well as behind the times , but do n't let 's talk any more about this . We 'll never agree , I can see that . Perhaps when you have lived a little longer and been out in the real world awhilep128you 'll change your ideas . However , I can stand it , if you 'll just keep it to yourself . You 'll get over this fad of course , and I 'll do my best to help you . Let 's change the subject . How would you like me to tell you about some of my thrilling experiences ? As a rule I do n't care to talk them over with these newsmongers that come around us vets , but you are different . You 've known me all my life and you 'll under-stand . " Eden sat looking at him gravely . " Very well , " she said . " Go on . " Almost sullenly , but very pompously he began his story . It was a thrilling story , there was no mistake about that , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ omit to mention his own courageous part in glowing terms , so glowing that Eden found herself constantly wondering if he were telling the whole truth , and whether some few of the great acts of prowess and courage should not be ascribed to the credit of some of the others of his regiment , but she put the thought aside and listened , watching her old friend , and studying his handsome , weak face , noting for the first time the arrogance of his chin , the shiftiness of his glance . Did his eyes always look so sort of sly , his mouth have that crafty twist , even when he smiled , or had he acquired that during his absence in service ? But at last he seemed to come to the end of his tale . He looked at her proudly ready to receive her praise . This really was what he had come for the first time he called on her . He wanted her flattery , her exclamations of wonder and delight in his bravery , and she had not once interrupted him . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found he was looking into an extended silence , and that instead of praising his courage she was merely watching him sadly , studying him , as one would look with troubledp129gaze at something that used to be of value , but had somehow become ruined . At last , just as he was growing very uneasy and most impatient she spoke : " And do you mean to tell me , Caspar , that you went through all that terror and awfulness , without once calling on God , or wanting His help ? " " Help ! " screamed Caspar scornfully . " Why should I want help ? I had to be my own help . I was trained , was n't I , to fly and to shoot , and to work all the tricks we were supposed to work on the enemy . It was up to me , not God . I did n't need any help but myself , and why should I cry out to a God I did n't believe in ? When I first went into the army I was thrown with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't believe in God . They said it was sissy to believe in such things . When you went into danger you were up against danger yourself , and had to make your own way out of it . To tell you the truth if I had called on anybody for help I would more likely have called on the devil for help than God . If there was a God who could have helped me , why did He let me get into such awful straits , I ask you ? " " Perhaps to show you how much you needed Him . Perhaps to make you turn to Him . You once chose God to be your Guide and helper . " " Oh , well , I got over all that nonsense long ago . " " You mean you are serving the devil now ? " asked Eden . " Perhaps , " he answered with a grin , " but forget it . The war is over and I 've got a good line on a successful job for myself where I can get rich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'd promise to quit preaching you and I could have a swell life , going out among ' em and making up for all the dull life you 've lived so far . You 'd be surprised how happy I could make you if you 'd just give up this line and get a bitp130gay . Of course not just now , so soon after a funeral in the family . But by the time I 'm out of the army and back home and well into my job , I want you to be ready when I call . " Eden did not smile . She only looked at him sadly . " No , Caspar , " she said solemnly , " I have no desire for a life like that . And I could never marry you , knowing how you feel about my Lord and the things of life that are the most precious to me . And anyway , Caspar , there is more to marriage than just having a swell time . I do not love you and have no desire to marry you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faith I used to think you had , and I shall pray for you that God will sometime draw you back to Him . But that is all . You and I do not belong together any more , even as friends , since you have turned away from all that I hold most dear . " A thunder cloud settled down over the weak , handsome face , and made him look more than ever like a frustrated naughty boy . At last he spoke : " What does this mean , Eden ? Is there some other guy you 've been going around with since I went away ? Somebody you think you are engaged to ? Because if there is I 'll kill him . I swear I will . I 've always considered that you belonged to me , and always would , and you ca n't cheat me out of my rights . I wo n't stand for it . " Eden 's face suddenly froze into haughtiness . " That is no way for you to talk to me , Caspar , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you in any way , and you know it . Our friendship was only a childish one ; we were just playmates , even when I thought you were a good man . And now that you so evidently are serving the devil I do n't feel that I care to see you again . It would not be even pleasant any more . " " You mean that you are engaged to some one else ? Somep131sissy of a guy who did n't have the nerve to go to war ? Who is he ? I 'll go out and find him and make him understand you belong to me . What 's his name ? I demand to know it . " Eden was very quiet and steady as she answered . " I am not engaged to anybody , Caspar , and I have not been running around with anybody . I have n't had time . But I see no reason why it should be anything to you if I did . And now I think we have talked enough , and I wish you would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become . Good-by ! " Eden turned to go out of the room , but Caspar hurried to intercept her before she reached the door . " Aw , ferget it , Ede . Do n't go off that way again . This is ridiculous ! You never useta be like this ! " " Neither did you , Caspar . You have gone back on all that means life to me , and I ca n't be friends with you any more . Good-by , " and Eden went and stood by the front door to bow him out . The young man stood miserable with downcast eyes , which he lifted only to look her over , the slim charming figure , the lovely eyes that had so often smiled at him , the pretty hands , clasped so determinedly as he had so often seen them for some mutual scheme of theirs as children , and Caspar was wondering how he came to forget how swell she was , and why he had n't been writing to her all these months . That would have fixed her as his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get all these antique religious ideas . " Eden ! " he pleaded , " at least you 'll kiss me good-by ! " and he made as if to come nearer . But Eden backed away . " No ! " she cried . " Please go away ! " And then a stern old Scotch voice was heard behind them : Janet coming as fast as her feet could carry her in spite of arthritis that troubled her now and then.  | " Did ye call me , my leddy ? I 'm coomin ' . " " Yes , Janet , " said Eden sweetly . " Please open the door for Mr. Carvel . He has to leave ! " and Eden vanished up the stairs , leaving Caspar Carvel to make his dejected way out of the house , evicted for the second time from the place where he had supposed he would always be welcome . Then Eden went up to her room and flung herself down on her knees with her face in the pillow , and cried to her new Lord . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leading . I let my own anger rise , and I said angry things that were in my heart instead of following Thy Spirit . Oh , forgive me ! I should have said something that would make him understand how wonderful You are , and I did n't in the least convince him , I 'm sure . Oh , Lord , please take over , and somehow bring him to a place where he will understand . " Just then her telephone rang , and much distraught , with tears on her cheeks , Eden jumped up and answered it . " Yes ? " she said , struggling to steady her perturbed voice . And then she recognized Caspar 's voice . " Oh ! " she said . " Oh ! " remembering she must follow the leading from above . " Eden , " almost humbly , " I 'm sorry I made you angry again . I really did n't mean to , and I apologize . But I want to ask you to promise me one thing : Promise me that you will never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away . I might change again and get to be what you want , but it would n't be fair to me to string me along for years thinking I was doing it for you , and then have you stand me up after-ward . " Eden was very still for a minute for she could feel her anger rising , but here was where she must hand herself over to herp133Guide . A moment more and her voice was steady , clear , and she knew just what to say : " Caspar , there is just one thing I 'll promise you , and I will not promise anything else . I promise to pray for you that you may somehow get to know God . Good night . " Then she hung up , and Caspar , angry and chastened in spirit , went on his devious way back to the world which had led him away from the path where he had started . And Eden went back to her prayers , and wondered if a prayer uttered from an angry heart could ever help to bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he had ever been in the right way at all , and whether perhaps her beloved father had seen this . Perhaps that had been one of the reasons why he planned trips to take her away from this boy 's companionship . She saw now what Caspar had become , as she might have seen before if she had not been so interested in having the good times with him which he seemed always able to plan . She saw it now , and was thankful that God had made it plain to her before she was led into a return of the friendship which might have been a real danger to her . For now as she thought things over calmly , perhaps with the enlightenment of the inward Guide , she realized that she had been looking forward greatly to the return of her old-time playmate . Now she knew that he could never be her old-time friend again . Even if he should change as he suggested , she had lost the sense that he was fine and wonderful , which she had when he went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sore to look the fact in the face and see that she had no old friend to cherish . He was gone out of her life and could never come back . She would pray for him , yes , but she would leave him in God 's hands . It would perhaps not be a prayer of much faith , for Caspar hadp134proved to her tonight more than ever that there was not much there to build any hope upon , and it would be only God who could ever make anything of Caspar Carvel . Perhaps He could . Of course He could , for He was all powerful , but she was sure no words of hers ever could . When she lay down to rest that night somehow a great burden rolled away from her , and she began to wonder if she had been carrying her disappointment in her old friend about , as a burden on her heart . At least it was now gone . She had laid him definitely in God 's hands . As she dropped away to sleep some pleasant words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look in his eyes as he spoke them gave her a happy thought to drive other worries away . Life was changing for her . It was inevitable that it should change when her dear father was taken away , but she had not been prepared to have the very foundations of her childhood swept away from under her . New friends , new experiences ! Frightening occurrences . Mr. Warden was still at hand , and his pleasant new lawyer . That was nice . Janet was still there , bless her , and Tabor was getting well , thank the Lord for that ! And she had a new Lord . She could go on from there and live out her life as God would plan . She need not be afraid , even of Ellery Fane and his silly scheming mother . And so she slept.  |p135AND  the next day there arrived in Glencarroll three sistersfrom California , cousins of Eden 's mother . Three women of the world who were neither old nor young , just enough older than Eden to assume to advise her , just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ semi-companionsfor a girl alone in the world , just well enough off financially to realize what it would mean to them to have a young girl , financially independent , and generously inclined , under their care and patronage . They went at once to the Glencarroll Hotel , and called up on the telephone to make their presence known , probably hoping to be at once welcome to the hospitable Thurston home . Eden had never known them intimately . There had been occasional letters back and forth during her father 's lifetime , and once Eden had spent three days at their home in California , but she did not feel that they would be an asset to her life at this time , and so when they called up and expressed their sympathy in her recent sorrow , she thanked them , and explained that Tabor , their old servant , had been very ill , and it just was n't convenient at present for her to ask anyone to visit them , but she would run over and see them within a couple of hours and find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat down and thought over what the coming of these unwanted relatives was going to mean to her . It was obvious that she should not invite them to visit her at present , not with Tabor sick and so much for the servants to do . Besides she was in no mood for takingp136them around to see the sights , as she knew they would wish to go . Here was a situation that would have to be trusted in the hands of the Lord . So she dressed very soberly and went to the hotel . The cousins were most effusive , and said they had come to get her and take her home with them . They had talked it all over and decided that would be best for her , to get away from all sorrowful surroundings , where she would be more or less bound to live a quiet life for sometime , here among her father 's friends . So they had dropped everything and come after her , before she had had time to make any other plans . They were very voluble , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off , until they had placed before her all their plans for showing her a pleasant winter , and making a permanent home for her in their company . Eden hoped that her telltale face did not make too plain how she would not like to accept their invitation , and how she would hate to live with them . But she kept a smile and waited until they had laid before her their whole plan , and then she pleasantly undertook to answer . " It is very sweet of you to try to make nice plans for me , " she said with one of her loveliest smiles , " and I do appreciate your kindness . I remember your pretty home in that sunny land , and I know you would do your best to make me happy . I thank you from my heart for being so kind . But it would be quite impossible for me to leave here at present . There are business matters that I must settle , and there are plans that I have made which must be carried out . Also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Father left in my hands . I could not possibly go away anywhere now . " " But my dear , you have been through so much . Yourp137father 's sickness and death must have been very hard on you , and I should think friends and obligations could wait while you have a time of resting and getting back your normal vivacity . You have a right to get away and get new poise after a shock like death . " Eden shook her head and smiled . " My father 's death was not a shock , " she said sweetly . " He talked it all over with me months ago , and prepared me for all the changes that would have to come . Of course it was a great sorrow to have to lose him , but I understood , and he and I together planned out what I should do , and how my time was to be occupied . Besides that I have many friends here whom I enjoy , and who mean much to me . I love my home , and our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for me to stay . I am afraid I would be very homesick away from here , especially just now . Though I certainly do thank you for your very kind thought of me . I am only sorry that I am not in a position just now to ask you to come right home for a few days while you are in this vicinity . But you see we had a most unpleasant happening . A burglar broke into the house and tried to steal some of father 's valuable papers , just the day of his funeral , and our good old butler went out to try and catch him , and got stabbed in the back . He has been very critically ill in the house ever since it happened , and that has somewhat disorganized our household , so that it would not be very convenient for us to try and have guests at present . That is the reason I came over at once , to explain , and to suggest that if you were to be in the vicinity later , say in a couple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might arrange to spend a few days with me then . I am quite sure Tabor will be well by that time . At least the doctor says he is reasonably sure . Could you arrangep138your plans for that ? You were so kind to invite me when I was in California that I would certainly like to return the favor . " " Oh , my dear ! That 's sweet of you to plan so far ahead , " said Elspeth , the oldest of the three sisters . " But my dear , I ca n't see any sense in delaying our visit that way . Surely you do n't have to keep a sick servant in the house at the expense of your visiting guests . Could n't you send him to the hospital ? He could certainly be better cared for there than in your home , and then we could come right over and be with you for a while until we could persuade you to return with us . " " Yes , " said Clarine , the next sister , " that would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give up taking you back with us , Eden . We have quite made up our minds , have n't we girls ? And you know the Haldanes do not easily change their minds when once they are made up . So Eden , wo n't you go to the telephone and call an ambulance and have that old butler taken to the hospital at once ? Then we can come over and have a really good visit . I can understand how hard it would be to have a sick servant with company , but surely you can get another butler , and if necessary we girls can help until you secure one . Nerissa is awfully good at getting up dainty lunches and even serving them on occasion . Are n't you , Nerissa ? " Thus appealed to , Nerissa , the third and youngest sister smiled and assured Eden she would be glad to do anything to help out . " So Eden , you see , the best you can do is to get your servant out of the way , and we can go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't unpack yet . There is a telephone right over on the right of the desk . Go and get it off your mind , dear , while we wait . "  |p139Eden  sat up very straight and looked at her would-be guests with surprise . " I 'm sorry , " she said quietly . " You do n't understand . Our servant is much too sick to be moved yet , and we could n't think of sending him away . He has been a part of our family for years . And it would not be at all convenient for me to have guests at present . I am sure you will understand . If you can plan to come later I shall be glad to arrange it if it is possible . And now , have you pleasant rooms at the hotel ? I know they are crowded everywhere , but I suppose you must have secured reservations . " " Well , no , we did n't , " said Elspeth . " We were counting on you , naturally , and we really were hoping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suitcase and start right back with us . " " Well , that is out of the question , and it is equally impossible for me to have guests at present . It will probably be a couple of months before my plans would allow me to send for you , but if you are to be here later there would be some very delightful concerts on then . I know you are fond of music . And there are lectures always . " " Oh , lectures ! " laughed Nerissa . " Imagine it ! Is that your idea of a good time , Eden ? It is n't mine . I want to see some night life . Of course New York is the place for that . Why not come up with us for a little while and go the rounds ? " " Thank you no , " said Eden gravely . " I never cared for that sort of thing you know , and certainly not now . " " Oh , you poor little thing . You must n't be tied to a somber style @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll need to go out and have good times . We 'll see to that when we get you under our thumbs , " said Clarine shaking a warning finger atp140her and tossing her head with a motion that set the floral earrings in her ears jingling . Eden was beginning to lose her temper now in a hopeless kind of daze , and she took a deep breath and sailed in , makingher statements very clearly : " I am sorry to disappoint you , but you might as well understand that all this is quite impossible . I am staying right here in my home and carrying out the plans my father and I made for my life . I do not wish to go away anywhere at present . I do appreciate your trying to help me , but I do not want help now . So , since I am rather busy at present and find it hard to get away from the house long at a time , or often , suppose you be my guests here at the hotel for lunch , and then you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . That is the way it will have to be for the present at least . " So finally the three sisters , much surprised that the gentle Eden had so asserted herself and could be so firm , succumbed , and let Eden take them into the hotel dining room for lunch , and then in rather dignified high dudgeon , they took themselvesoff to New York . Eden , tired out from the experience of the morning went back home wondering . What in the world had happened that all the unpleasant people she knew had to turn up and torment her , right here at home when she was going through so much else ? Well , there was probably some good reason why it all had to be . Perhaps her friend the lawyer would have some theory wherewith to explain it . When Eden went into the house she found Mr. Worden there pacing back and forth in the hall , looking at his watch . " Oh , my dear , I 'm so glad you have come . I very much want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this matter of the robbery . I want to keep you out of the trialp141if possible , and I think perhaps this may help , but it should reach the judge at once . Suppose you just sit down and read it over carefully and see if I have made the statement just as it happened . When they had finished with the paper Mr. Worden folded it carefully and put it in his brief case . " Thank you , my dear . I 'll get this into the right hands at once . And now , I wonder how you would like a ride out into the country this afternoon ? My lawyer and I have to go out to draw up and witness a will for an old man who is not likely to live long , and wants to get his affairs in shape . My wife wants to go too if she can get out of an engagement she made for a committee meeting . So I thought if you would go along that would be some one for Lorrimer to talk to . I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be real folks for a change and sit in the back seat and luxuriate . Would you enjoy that , or am I barging in on some other more attractive plan of yours for spending the afternoon ? " " Oh , that will be wonderful ! " said Eden , the light in her eyes and the flush on her cheeks showing how much the suggestionpleased her . " You do n't know how I long to get away from the telephone for a little while . Someone is always coming in on me and wanting to stay with me , or something like that . I 've just got away from three cousins from California who are trying to insist on my going back with them to live . " Mr. Worden laughed . " Yes , " he said , " I understood from Janet that you were in the hands of those three ' harpies ' as your father used to call them . I was afraid you would n't get away from them in time for me to get this paper off in the mail . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I must be hurrying along . We 'll be stopping for you at half past two . Will that be all right ? And mean/time if any more unwanteds ' turn up just deny yourself to them firmly and stay hidden till Janet calls you . Good-by . " Eden danced up the stairs with almost real happiness in her eyes  --  and found Janet waiting for her , anxiety on her brow . " An ' didna ye see them coosins ? " she asked . " Wull they be coomin ' here the nicht ? Whut room would ye lak me tae prepare ? " " They are not coming , " said Eden . " I told them it would n't be convenient now while Tabor is sick . I said they might come back in a couple of months if they happened to be in this region then . I took them to lunch at the hotel , and saw them off to New York on the noon train . Do you think that was awful of me ? Besides , what they wanted to do was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and branch , and have me stay with them permanently , and let them steer me through life . Imagine that , Janet ! Would n't that have been terrible ? " " It would indeed , my lambkin . Boot I 'm thinkin ' they had a wee bit of an eye toward your siller , my sweet . They kenned ye was generous , I 'm thinkin ' , and they intended to get out of ye onythin ' they wanted . Oh , of I were tae see thim coomin ' in the door I 'd tell thim nae , they couldna enter . Ye did weel tae hie thim awa ' tae Noo York . They dinna belang in this hoose , thet 's certain . " " No , they do not , " said Eden , " but it seemed ungracious in me after they had invited me to their home four years ago . Of course father would n't let me stay but two days . I know he never liked them . And now I 'm so glad they are not here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And they do n't like anything I like . They want to be going , going , going all the time , and seeing notable people . I 'm sure they would have tried to put me up to inviting several parties if theyp143had stayed . Oh , why are such people tormenting me now when daddy is gone ? " " It 's because they are canny an ' wanttae share yer fortune , " said wise Janet , hurrying about to put away Eden 's coat and hat . " But Janet , " protested Eden , " there you go spoiling me again . " How will I ever get tidy habits if you go around waiting on me , and picking up after me ? " " Oh , ye cheeld ! Ye air thet sweet an ' gude naethin ' can spoil ye . " " There you go , flattering me , Janet . I 'm sure daddy never allowed you to flatter me . " " Not whin ye were a wee bairnie , boot ye air growed , the noo , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she canna wait on her nurslin ' ? Gang awa ' ter yer bed , my wee girlie , an ' take yersel ' a bit of rest afore the car cames fer ye . Yell be nane the worse fer it . " " Lie down , Janet ? Why , I 'm not tired , and I 'm going to have a lovely restful afternoon , riding in the country . It seems wonderful after escaping what I did . Now find me a clean blouse , Janet dear . I promised to be ready by half past two , and it 's ten minutes after , now . " So Eden was soon dressed and down at the door when the Worden car drew up . Lorrimer was driving and looked happy to put her in the seat beside himself . Janet stood behind the lace curtain and watched them drive away , well pleased to see her nursling beside a young man she need not disapprove . It had been hard for her when Caspar Carvel came back from war . She never had approved of him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like him , though he was always most kind to him . So into the beautiful blue of the autumn afternoon theyp144went , the soft green feathers of her hat making a frame about Eden 's lovely face , and the pleasure in her eyes softening the lines of recent sorrow that had been so marked when Lorrimer first saw her . " She is very lovely , " he said to himself , " and you must go carefully , lad . She is wealthy , you know , and you are a young man only beginning your fortune . You must n't allow yourself to get too interested in her . But I certainly am glad she is along with us today . " That was what he thought as he settled himself for the long ride and the privilege of enjoying it with this unusually lovely girl . Meantime in a far hideout Ellery Pane , in borrowed garments , skulked in an unsavory den and conversed sullenly with former pals , trying to plan how to contact his erstwhile prison abode and find out if his mother had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was discovered that another member of their gang was expected in a couple of days , en route to Mexico , and it would be easy to send out a feeler through him . So Ellery spent time working out in code an innocent telegram to his mother that purported to be from her grandchild , one named Tilly Brandeis , age nine years , begging her to come home in time for her birthday party and to bring her a string of red beads . This with a silly sentence about her curling red hair , innocently conveyed the fact that Ellery still retained one ruby of the booty he had hidden under a patch of adhesive tape over a self-inflicted wound , in his hair , that showed enough blood to imitate the real thing . But of course the message was one that nobody but Lavira Fane could possibly translate . It seemed to be from an innocent little girl who wanted a beloved relative home for her birthday party . And sop145it was finally showed to Lavira , who wept over it profusely . But she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not entirely without funds , and it gave her a clue where to find ' him if she could manage to get out . The matron watched her while she read it , and saw a look of such satisfactionsettle over the sharp face , that she took the telegram away with her and gave it to the chief of police who somehow read something into it , or tried to , and began the frantic search again for the missing thief , Ellery . It was well that Eden could not know anything about this or the wonderful peace and placidity of the day might have been clouded for her . She was anxious only to forget the awfulness of that night when Ellery Fane walked back into her life and did his best to stay there . It was now just like a bad dream that she only remembered when she sat by Tabor 's bed and watched the gentle , patient look in his eyes . Poor Tabor had taken the hard part of this from her and now he was getting his joy out of it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for him to have that dear child sitting by his side for an hour or two a day and reading to him out of the Bible . Tabor had always been of a discreet turn of mind , and religiously inclined , but he had never been able to get very much out of his personal reading of the Bible . Now , however , when Eden read it he began to understand the love of the great God for him , that He had cared enough even for a poor servant to die for him . To take all his sin and mistakes upon Himself and pay the price in His own blood for them . All that had been in the Bible all the time , he supposed , as he thought about the matter , only he had never been able to understand it before until that sweet girl-voice had brought the words to the understanding of his very soul . So Tabor thought about it after she had gone out , and was glad she hadp146taken the afternoon off , and gone driving in such nice com @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afternoon Caspar Carvel found himself in a very annoying position . He had come down to the shore with a buddie from overseas who had expected to find his family spending the week end in their summer cottage . When they got there they found that ya chance invitation had taken them up the coast a few miles for a cocktail party . It was while his friend was hunting his parents that Caspar Carvel was at a loss what to do with himself . His friend had gone up the street to a neighbor 's cottage , somebody who lived at the shore all the year around , and had left Caspar in his parents ' pleasant cottage living room . There was a desk well stocked with stationery , pens and ink . He might write a letter , but he laughed aloud at the idea . Whom would he write to ? Eden ? She would n't read it . She would either return it unopened , or else she would tear it up and never answer it . And anyway , what could he say to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kid her along the way he had always done , but she would n't like it . No , he would n't write a letter . Or say , he might write to that little number he danced with at the night club last night . He did n't know a thing about her of course except that she smiled at him even before he had looked her over , and she accepted his invitation to dance without hesitation . She was n't even a hostess in a canteen either . Just a common little girl who was out for a good time . He had asked her name and she said " Cutie Cordell " and she borrowed his pencil and wrote it down with her address and telephone number . Showed what she was . He had n't been so much attracted either , but what difference did it make ? One girl might bep147as good as another to have a good time with , and after all when she had gone to all that trouble to write out her address it would be too bad to disappoint her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of handsome letter paper and began to write . Dear little Sugar Plum : You see I ca n't forget you , and so now that I have a few minutes to wait for a train I am taking this opportunity to write you a letter . You are a cute little number , and I do n't wonder that is your name , Cutie ! It just fits you . I just want to tell you that I enjoyed my dance with you . You were super ! And I hope you come around the next time I drop into your town . I want to sec your pretty eyes . They are like two stars . I shall not forget the sweet kiss you gave me , and I shall be back for another before long . Do n't forget me , Cutie , and I 'll remember you . Yours for remembering , CappicCaspar put his letter in an envelope , sealed it , and selecting a stamp from a little open stamp box on the desk affixed it to the envelope . Then he sat back and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that had nagged him ever since he had been driven away from Eden 's presence . Of course he knew it was his own fault , and yet he told himself it was the only way to bring that silly girl to understand that she was all out of date , and had to give up her father 's queer old ideas and get some new ones , learn what modern people and science had found out about the stuffy old religion that she had been brought up to respect . Of course he could never marry her while she held such fussy ideas . He could n't be happy with her . But he had learned to know since he had seen her again that there was no onep148anywhere who came up to her in beauty and utter dearness , and he remembered how sweet she had been sometimes . Suddenlythat inward urge made him reach forward and take another sheet of the heavily embossed paper , and start to writeagain . Dear Eden : I am still thinking of you , though I know if you are thinking of me it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why I had to be so disagreeable to you , but I just could n't help it . I felt you must somehow be made to wake up and get wise to the modern way of thinking . But I might have gone a little slower , and not have antagonized you quite so much . For I am convinced that it wo n't be long before you find out that I am right , and then I am certain you will change your ideas and we shall be okay as chums and pals again , and perhaps something still closer . He read over what he had written and decided it sounded very well , and was a good line to go on , sort of sympathetic and loving , and would show her he had n't given her up for all her hard refusals . He frowned at the paper and decided to write a few more lines . I do n't know when I shall be coming back  --  perhaps soon , because I have almost enough points to rate being discharged . And it occurs to me that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notice my rank and decorations . I have some you might as an old pal of mine be proud to see . But of course there is always the possibility that I may be picked off in one of these last trips , so if that 's my fate , do n't worry about me . When you 're dead you 're dead , and that 's all there is to it . I wo n't have to worry any longer about how an old friend treated me . But I 'm no pessimist , I do n't expect to pass out yet . I 'm too young , and there 's too much left for me to live for . But if I do I guess I 'll stand as good a chance as the next guy , sop149do n't worry your pretty head praying for me . I 'm not worth it . Besides I do n't believe in it any more , remember . So long , and I 'll be seeing you again soon . CappieHis friend was returning , coming up the steps . He scribbled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , stamped and sealed it , and rose to go out with his friend , feeling most virtuous because he had written two letters . If one did n't " take , " perhaps the other would . The way he felt just now it did n't seem to matter much which one . So at the next post box the two letters started on their way together . T HE day seemed to glow more gloriously for Eden as they drove farther away from the home town , and penetrated into little by-roads where she had not often gone . They passed pleasant farmhouses back from the road with plenty of trees about them , that suited so well their surroundings , fairly glowingin autumn colors . Nice smug villages with neat wellpaintedhouses , and children playing on the street or in the yards . The woman 's clubhouse , unpretentious , but well cared for , two or three little churches of different denominations , and then more woods , a modest mountain or two grading down to lovely green hills and more little villages . And at last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dying man was waiting for them . The banker and lawyer got out and went into the house , leaving Eden with Mrs. Worden . They sat in the comfortablep150car and talked quietly , feeling somehow the shadow of death that was hovering over that house . Mrs. Worden spoke of the old man 's wife who had died a couple of years before , and his married daughter who had several children , and his two sons who were both still across the seas . And then they gradually got to talking of people they both knew well in Glencarroll . It was n't a particularly enlivening conversation , and Eden was glad when at last the two men came back and got into the car , their business completed . The sun was getting ready for a grand display of flaming sky as they started on their way again , and delicate tintings flashed into vivid colorings as the sun slipped down lower and lower behind the lovely wooded hills . The sky above glowed deeper and dashed into crimson and turquoise and purple and gold , with beauty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catch their breath with delight in its loveliness . And the older people , too , took their pleasure in it , though more quietly . It had been planned that they should journey on to a smaller city on the fringe of the mountains to a rather famous inn to take dinner , and they all felt that the day was having a rare ending as far as setting was concerned . But it was in this time with that glowing , vivid sky above them that Eden and Lance Lorrimer had their opportunity for quiet talk . It seemed that Eden had so many questions , and the young lawyer was the only one she felt could really answer them , because her shyness with him had been broken down by former talks , and because he understood the new life she was striving to enter . The sound of their going drowned their quiet voices , so that they did not feel that they had an audience , and Lancep151Lorrimer studied the girl 's sweet face , and rejoiced to see the devout look of earnestness in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the themes about which she had planned to ask him , but suddenly he turned to her and asked , " Well , how did you come out ? Were you helped through the hard time you were anticipating ? " She turned a bright face toward him , that nevertheless was touched by a shadow of perplexity . " Oh , yes , I was helped . I was able to really speak out the truth of what I felt was so . But  --  " " But what ? " he asked interestedly . " There are no buts where God is concerned you know . Not if you are fully leavingit to Him . " " Yes , I know , " said Eden slowly , " but afterward I wondered , was I really leaving it all to God , or was I putting in my own oar , what I thought was righteous anger at somebody ? I 'm afraid I was n't gentle enough . He had spoken out against God , and I could n't just let it go , could I ? But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Sometimes , " said Lorrimer , trying to follow her difficult utterance . " You could n't just keep still and seem to agree against your Lord . " " I know , " said Eden , " but still it was hard not to be angry at him . I think I was pretty severe , and afterward I felt that perhaps there had been too much of myself and my own personalindignation . But it was a help to know you were pray-ing . " " It was a joy to me to have the privilege , " said the young man almost reverently . It was sweet low talk , and their earnest young faces made a picture of interest to the two older people who sat behind them.  |p152Then  suddenly they reached the inn , and the quiet time was over , the lovely day gone , into a blending of purple and gold below a dome of delicate rose and green , with a single star glinting out like a diamond on a lovely fabric . They had a delicious dinner , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eden to be away from all the thoughts that had troubled her since her father had been taken from her . But what would she have said if she could have known that another element was to come into her life on the morrow ? Oh , it was just an old college friend , Vesta Nevin , and her brother Niles Nevin , who boarded the southbound train from Boston that evening , and laid their plans for an outing that was to include a trip to Washington , and places still farther south , Florida perhaps . " I 'll tell you what I 'd like to do , Niles , if it wo n't upset any of your plans , " said Vesta as they settled back to wait while their berths were being made up . " I 'd like to run down a few hours to Glencarroll and see my friend Eden . It 's not so far below New York , at least it 's between Philadelphia and New York somewhere , and we could take an early train down from New York and stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see me , for we were very close friends in college you know , and she 's just lost her father . I 'd like to be sympathetic enough to stop off and see her and find out what she is going to do now . You met her , too , do n't you remember , once at a college prom or something ? She 's a darling , and pretty as a picture , or was . How about it ? Can you humor me ? " " Why sure , Vesta , if you want to . I could hang around and do something while you were chattering , " he smiled derisively . " Yes , I do remember some pretty little girl you especially emphasized when you introduced your gang . Was n't she ap153lot younger than you ? As I remember her she seemed a mere child . " " She was n't , " said Vesta . " She was one of the brightest girls in college , and only three months younger than I was . I hope you do n't feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pass , " grinned the brother , settling back against the cushion and looking at his pretty sister admiringly . " Of course we 'll arrange to stop off and see her if you like . This trip is your birthday present , you know . A pity if you ca n't have one stop off to please you . " " But Niles , I want you to go along to the house . I like to show off my distinguished big brother . I wo n't enjoy it one little minute if I think you are sighing around somewhere getting impatient . " " Oh , I 'll go along of course and do the honors , be polite and all that . But say , is n't this the girl that had such a distinguishedfather , wrote books or something ? " " Yes , wrote books and gave lectures too , and was a rich banker , besides . I do n't see how she stands it to have him gone . She was so devoted to him . " " Oh , heavens ! Then I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sob stuff and you know how I detest that , " said the young man , looking annoyed . " I do n't think you will , " said the sister . " Eden was n't the sobbing kind . She was always sweet and self-controlled , and you 'll like her , I know . She 's traveled a great deal , and she can talk well . " " Oh , I suppose you 'd think so if you like her . But well , all right , let 's take in Glencarroll in our tour . It 's better to have it come at the beginning this way , and then feel free . All right . In the morning I 'll get hold of some timetables andp154see how trains are . It 's a pity we have n't got our new cat It would be so much easier to take in these side trips that arc sure to appear as we go on . But cheer up . It wo n't be long before I can get that new car , and then we 'll take another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter was settled very happily and they soon went to their rest . But quite early the next morning Niles Nevin , consulting with the porter , got hold of necessary timetables , and mapped out a workable schedule for a stop-over at Glen carroll . " We 'd better send a wire or telephone , announcing our approach , " said the young man while they were in the dining car eating a hearty breakfast . " Oh , I 'd much rather walk in on her and surprise her , " said Vesta . " If we announce our coming she would think she had to get ready for us , invite us to stay over or something elaborate , and I 'd just enjoy surprising her . She loves sur-prises . " " But you do n't even know she is at home , and if she is n't we could save ourselves a trip and would n't have to bother going out of our way . " But Vesta shook her head . " Sorry , brother , that this is such a bore to you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see where she lives . She 's told me so much about her home , and I want to see it even if she is n't there . " " Well , of course if you feel that way , then that 's what we 'll do . " So about the middle of the morning a taxi drew up at the Thurston home , and the two young people got out and went in . It was Janet of course who came to the door , as Tabor wasp155not yet able to sit up , and when she said she would call her young lady , Vesta burst forth with an eager : " You 're Janet , are n't you ? Eden has told me so much about you , I was sure it was you . " Janet melted at once into cordiality and looked sharply at the visitor 's pretty face . " Yes , I 'm Janet , an ' yersel ' must be Miss Vesta , my leddy 's co-lidge roommate . I 've seen yer likeness . She 's thet fond o ' yer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tae see ye . Coom in an ' I 'll ca ' her . " " And Janet , this is my brother Niles . We 're on our way to Florida and we stopped off just to see Eden ! " Suddenly Eden abovestairs heard the beloved voice of her old friend and hurried down to greet her . It was a glad reunion , for Eden had been very fond of her former roommate , and she had not seen her for more than a year . For the first few minutes the time was occupied with questions and answers , accounting for what each had been doing , and the handsome brother sat by and watched the lovely stranger . For once he thoroughly agreed with his sister 's judgment of the right girl for a friend for her . As a rule he had some fault to find with all her girl friends , but this girl seemed not only really beautiful , but she seemed exceedingly intelligent , a good conversationalist with a good sense of humor . Even though she had just been through a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a relief , for he had counted on this visit being quite sad , full of sob stuff . But the recent death of Eden 's father had only been mentioned casually , and his sister 's words of sympathy had been received with a gentle smile . " Yes , I knew you would understand and sympathize withp156me , " Eden had said tenderly . " I was sure you would under stand how hard it had been for me . But you know , Vesta , we had such a beautiful time the last few weeks together . Dad talked with me about his going , and tried to make ii plain just what I would have to meet , and so even yet , though I miss him so terribly , I still feel that I am just on a journey and have to go on until the time comes to meet him again . He made it seem that way . And now , tell me where you have been all this time , and what you have been doing since you left college . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ journeys and interests , and there was hardly a chance for the brother to get a word in edgewise , until he suddenly broke in upon their chatter . " Vesta , are you still determined to take that twelve-thirty train ? Because if so we 've barely time to get to the station before it comes . " " Oh , but you must n't , " protested Eden . " We have n't half caught up on old times yet . You 'll have to stay here to lunch of course . If I know Janet she 's got some kind of a lunch ready . It may not be up to our usual style because our butler has had an accident and has been very sick . He 's better now and we hope will soon be up and taking his part in the householdregime , but in the meantime we 're taking whatever can be gotten together in a hurry . Do you mind ? Yes , here 's Janet . They 're ready for us . And surely there are other trains . After all this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Please ! " The young man smiled at the eager light in the girl 's lovely eyes , and then his own eyes sought his sister 's face . " We could take the later train , Vesta , " he said leniently , to let her know he was not being bored as he had expected . " All right , " said the sister , " we 'll wait for the afternoonp157train , provided you 'll consider going with us to Florida . Will you ? " A shadow of gravity came over Eden 's bright face . " Oh ! That would be lovely of course , but I really could n't think of going away anywhere just now . Perhaps sometime later , but I 'm not sure . " Then they began to tease her , to present every possible argument to induce her to go with them , but she was firm . " I really could n't think of leaving home while Tabor is so sick . " " But is n't he just a servant ? Ca n't you trust the other servantsand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think that 's absurd to let a servant interfere with your own plans and happiness . " " You do n't understand , Vesta , " said Eden earnestly . " Tabor is one of us . He has been with my father since my father and mother were married . Before I was born he was here , and we all love him very much . And now that he is getting better he likes me to read to him , and sing for him sometimes . No , I could not go anywhere at present . But I wish you would promise to stop here on your way back . 1 think we could have some nice times together . " " Well , perhaps we will . But better still , why not come down to us for a while after your servant gets well enough to leave ? " Eden gave a swift review of her unconsidered near-future , hesitated and smiled . " Well , that sounds pleasant . I 'll think about it and see how things turn out . I ca n't really promise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just what plans I can make . " " Oh , now , now , " said the young man , " that does n't sound very hopeful . You have n't any other servants who are coming down with something and have to be nursed , have you ? Orp158you have n't got a young man in the offing somewhere who has a hold on you ? " Eden laughed and shook her head . " No , I hope not , but there are several matters I have to look after , and I 'm not sure how long they may take . But I 'll really think about it and see if it can be managed . " Afterward , when the pleasant guests had left on the afternoontrain , and Eden was alone , she sat and thought about it a few minutes , and tried to be frank with herself . She decided that the truth was , she just did n't want to go away anywhere , even in delightful company . She wanted to stay here , and go on getting acquainted with this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " You have n't a young man in the offing somewhere who has a hold on you ? " and her face grew sober . Was it possible that Lance Lorrimer was getting too interesting ? Ought she perhaps to go away and put a stop to any such interest before it got a hold on her ? She did n't know a thing about the young lawyer except that he was a Christian . He might be engaged , or even married for all she knew , and she simply must not allow herself to let her thoughts dwell too interestedly on him . At least not now . Not till she knew more about him . And of course he was n't interested in her except to help her . They certainly had a right to a bit of pleasant friendship on that score . But the thought lingered with her , and she had to own that she liked him a lot . She really had n't thought about him before in the light of a possible close companion , and she must n't either . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reminded her that she must go carefully . But on the way to the city to take the evening train forp159Florida , with maybe a stop-over in Washington , the Nevin brother and sister were discussing the recent visit . " Well , she 's some girl , I grant you . I do n't wonder you raved so over her when you came back from college . I thought you were crazy , you know , you talked so much about her , and to tell you the truth I did n't see stopping over there today to see a colorless little girl like that , even if her father was famous , and she did have a private income of her own , as you saw fit to emphasize again and again . But now I 've seen her I do n't wonder in the least . I certainly hope she gets loose from that doddering old servant of hers pretty soon and that we can coax her down to Florida with us . I could go for her in a big way . She 's some girl , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inheritance or not . What 's money when you find the right girl ? I believe I 've found her , thanks to my sister . Now Vesta , are you satisfied ? " Vesta smiled . " I knew you would like her , Niles . That 's why I was so insistent about going . I certainly spent time on you when I was in college trying to get you two together . I could n't think of any more ideal relative to have as a sister than Eden . " " Well , did n't I always tell you you had good taste , my lady-sister ? " " Oh , do n't be silly . I 'm just happy to think you liked her . The only trouble is I 'm afraid you 'll find some dizzy blonde down in Florida and fall for her even harder than for Eden . " Niles gave her a grin that acknowledged he knew his own weaknesses . " Okay , " he said . " I know I 've fallen for a good many , but not so hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better . However , you know I 'm growing older . The time has got to come when one reaches a maturity . He does get a little sensep160and realize that he must settle down for keeps . However if you object to my present admiration , I presume I can find someone else to rave over , until we get home at least . " " Oh , stop acting like a fool , Niles , and talk sense . I 'm terriblyglad you liked Eden , and perhaps we 'll get a chance to see more of her this winter . In the meantime , when and where are we going to stop in Washington ? Or shall we go straight on to Florida where we have reservations ? " So they drifted into talk about other matters . But when Vesta went to her rest that night in a dinky little rooming house in Washington , which was the only respectable place they could find , she lay for sometime turning over the thin little pillow and exulting in the fact that Niles had really admired her beloved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had n't been she would have had many more charges against her than she had , for so far she had pretty well got away with them . A few days in jail now and then , and some old pal with the hope of gain thereby , would turn up to swear an alibi for her , or testify to some utterly false statement . And it was a help that in addition to her cleverness she could on occasion be most humble , although some people described that humility as " meaching . " But she could if necessarydeceive even a matron of a suburban prison . So for the first few days of her re-confinement in the Glencarrollprison she was quiet , subdued , almost humble in herp161manner , biding her time . Saying to the matron that she really was grateful that she had been caught , for she simply dreaded to be out alone with the authorities against her . She told the matron she never had been smart to get away with things , that she had been brought up to be a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deceive , and she readily perceivedthat if one once got suspected of anything it was hopeless . Especially in her present position , here far away from her home and friends how could she hope to get help ? No one knew her any more , and no one was ready to help . Not even that little snob of an Eden Thurston would lift her hand to help her , though she was at least distantly related . So she was a most docile prisoner , and the matron , accustomed-though she was to judging tough characters , began to feel sorry for her , a poor old woman , whose son was really the only sinner of course , for now he had deserted her and left her to shift for herself . She even considered the possibility of suggesting to the authorities that someone might get in touch with the parents of the child who had sent the pitiful appeal to her for a string of red beads . Perhaps someone , if he knew , might shed light on her case , and produce some relatives to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guards was so sad and dejected and quite willing to resign herself to perpetual servitude . Lavira played this role so well that she was often allowed to come to the kitchen with the matron and help her with the cooking , glad to be of service in her despondent state . That was how it seemed . And so days passed by and the matron was kind to the poor woman , and gave her a privilege now and then , and some bit of extra fruit with her meals , and often called her to help her in the kitchen , which she did quite willingly though most shyly , looking almost fright/ened whenever the outside door opened near her , and turning that quick furtive look almost as if to run away and hide . And strange to say that matron really began to trust Lavira . Still , she was a good conscientious matron , and knew the rules of her institution , knew what was expected of her , and took no chances . She had been a matron too long in such places not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at dark , they were baking hot johnnycakeas a special treat . The grocery boy came in with his late Saturday night delivery order , just as the matron was taking out a hot pan of corn bread . Then the telephone rang . The matron dropped the hot pan on the top of the stove and went to unfasten the door for the groceries . The telephone rang persistently . It was against the rule for her to send a prisoner to the telephone , and the grocery boy was waiting to have the order signed and his basket emptied . The matron looked wildly from the waiting boy to the telephone , and then despairingly to her burning corn bread in the oven . But Lavira was there with all her senses alert , and stepped toward the oven . " Do n't you worry , I 'll take the rest of the pans out , " she said , stooping with a holder and lifting out the next pan , setting it on the top of the stove . So the matron signed the grocery boy 's paper , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be her director calling her . It was only a step or two to the phone in the corridor , and the communicationwas sharp and direct . " Yes sir ! Right away sir ! " she answered in a businesslike tone . But when she turned back to her stove the oven door was still wide open , a smell of scorched baking in the air , the grocery boy was gone , the back door was wide open and Lavira was nowhere to be seen !  |p163The  corn bread had to go on burning  --  discouraged a trifle by the open oven door , and the cold air rushing in from the outside  --  while the matron dashed wildly out of the door into the darkness calling after the grocery boy to know if he had seen the woman disappear . But the sound of the delivery car rattling down the lane showed her how hopeless that was , and there seemed to be no sign of any dark figures in the alley . The matron rushed back to the telephone and gave . the alarm to her chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been caught with the same prisoner disappearing for the second time . Lavira had been very quick . She knew how to slither into the shadows , and this time she had been preparing her mind for just such an opportunity as had come with that combination of circumstances , the burning food about to be served , the grocery boy , and the telephone . She had dropped the second pan like a flash and dashed out the open door and down the back steps , taking only time to snatch the old gray blanket from the seat of the delivery car , as she slid across to take shelter around the corner of a garage with its door wide open . It took but a second to fling the old blanket about her and over her head as she hurried along , out of the alley and down another street and another , avoiding pedestrians . as much as possible , and dashing on toward a country road she had often sighted when it had been possible for her to look out a window . It was strange what cleverness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at stake .. The matron worked fast . She got the whole force on the job at once , and then she went back to get those trays ready for the hungry prisoners , and take out the rest of the corn bread before it was burned to a crisp . As the whole force was on the job she had no doubt but the fugitive would soon bep164found . She simply could n't have got far away . But she knew , too , that her own time of reckoning would come . Oh , what a fool she had been ! To trust that sly woman ! Of course she was not glad to stay . She must have been watching every moment for a chance to get away . She with her son at large , and both of them now free to carry on their machinations . She recalled suddenly that some of the police force thought that the message from the child asking for red beads might have been a communication from the son , and now she was convinced it was , for she recalled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to her , so furtive . The matron was in sore trouble now lest she was going to lose her own job . It had been an easy one in a way , and one that she could not afford to lose . And so for the second time Mike came to the Thurston home with his crew and got permission to look around the house for any possible hiding place . A few minutes later Mr. Worden was notified and promptly sent his right-hand man , Lance Lorrimer , over to spend the evening with Eden and keep her from finding out about what had occurred , or at least keep her from worrying if it became necessary to tell her . Eden had been with Tabor , reading a bit of the news and his evening chapter to him , and she came to meet her guest with a shining face , aglow from Tabor 's daily thanks for her kindness . It seemed a happy time . And now to have Mr. Lorrimer come and settle down as if he were going to stay awhile made her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his two hands as he greeted her , and held them for just a second as if he too were glad , and smiled , deep into her eyes . " Do you mind my coming just to see you ? " he asked , almost shyly.  | " Oh , did you do that really , just to see me ? How wonderful , I ca n't think of anything nicer you could do to please me , " she said , with that ripple of welcoming joy in her voice that sounded so genuine . " And you wo n't hurry right off somewhere in a few minutes , this time , will you ? You 're always so busy , and a lot of stupid other people always have so very much time to stay and bore me . " He smiled . " Why , I thought you had a lot of wonderful friends , " he said , studying her face wistfully . " They said some came down from New York , old friends . " Eden laughed . " Now , where did you get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kitchen maids ? " He laughed . " Why , if I remember rightly it came to Mr. Worden through Mike , who , I think , did get it from your own kitchen perhaps . I do n't know that I would exactly call it gossip ! " " Why no , of course not , " she laughed . " Well , it was pleasant seeing them , but that was all . That has nothing to do with my being glad to see you . You see , there is one difference . You talk about real things and they talk about frills and nonsense . Yet of course they are very nice people and I like them a lot . But there is another thing , too , you understand about Tabor , and are in sympathy with him , and all my other friends keep commiserating me for having him in the house while he is getting well . They think I ought to send him to a hospital or a nursing home or something ! Only a servant ! ' they say with a sneer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what he 's always been to all of us . But you have seemed to understand . Even Mr. Worden understands a little I think ,  |p166for  he has never suggested that I send Tabor away . Of course I would n't even if he had . " " Yes , " said Lorrimer with a light in his eyes . " I understand , and I think your feeling in the matter is beautiful . And I am sure that from what little I have known of your wonderful father , he would have understood , too . Perhaps he knows now , and is pleased . " " Oh , I 'm so glad to hear you say so , " she said eagerly . " I was almost sure you understood . " " Thank you for understanding me so well , " smiled the young man . " And by the way , how is Tabor tonight ? " " Oh , he is getting well rapidly now , the doctor says , and he seems so happy . The doctor says it has made a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very lonely and despairing if he had been taken away . He knows he is getting old , and I 'm afraid he has been feeling that his time of usefulness is almost past . I could n't have stood it to have him go away , and I know he is being cared for as well as he could possibly be in a hospital . We have a wonderful nurse and doctor , and it is n't as if we needed any equipment that we could not easily procure . " " I am so glad you feel that way , " said Lorrimer . " Do you know it was that in you that first made me feel you were different from other girls . You were more kindly and thoughtful , more loyal to those who were devoted to you . " Eden 's face glowed with this bit of praise . " It is good to hear you say that , " she admitted shyly , " because so many have talked another way , and almost made me hate them , only I knew they did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to the door , with her deprecating air that she had to interrupt : " Miss Eden , " she said , " sorry to interrupt , but Tabor wasp167wantin ' tae know if that was Mr. Lorrimer in here , and if so , might he be seem ' him for a wee while . He 'll not keep him ower lang . " " Why yes , of course , " said Eden . " Mr. Lorrimer , you asked about Tabor and now he wants to see you . Do you mind ? " " Of course , " said the young man , springing up . " You 'll excuse me for a few minutes , Eden ? " " Of course , " she said , and started to go with him , then stepped back as she saw Janet wanted to speak to her . " That 's all right , " said Lorrimer , " I know the way to Tabor 's room , " and he hurried down the hall . " Yell be needin ' a tray in a wee while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anything special yell be wantin ' ? " " Oh , I 'll leave that to you , Janet . Your trays are always grand ! But , Janet , was n't there somebody else in to see Tabor ? I thought I heard another voice . Had I better go and see ? Tabor must n't have too much company at once . " " It 's joost Mike drapped in fer a chat . Tabor 's all richt ! Better let thim have their talk , Miss Eden . " Eden gave a quick suspicious look at Janet . She was well acquainted with her tone of voice whenever Janet was trying to evade a question , so she spoke quickly : " Has something happened , Janet ? What is Mike here for ? He ought not to worry Tabor . The doctor said we must keep him quiet . " " Tabor 's all richt ! " said Janet quickly , an anxious smile in her eyes . " I must go and see , " said Eden , and in spite of Janet 's earnest " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk alane , " she hurried out into the hall and down to the far door where Tabor lay . She appeared just in time to hear Mike say : " I think she oughtta be told , Mr. Lorrimer . She 's a sensiblep168lady , and she 'll be much safer if she knows all . She should stay in the house which will be well guarded until we can locate the old un . No tellin ' what that bird might not try if she 's desperate , an ' I think she is . Of course we 'll put a strong guard around the place tonight . " Then there was Eden standing in the door , and facing Mike . " Yes ? What is it , Mike , that I ought to be told ? You tell me . I wo n't mind what it is . I know you folks will take care of me . " " Yes , my lady , " put in Tabor 's voice most earnestly , with all the quaver gone , and a look as if he were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You must n't go out of the house until Mike says it 's safe , Miss Eden ! And that 's straight ! You need n't get worried . " " Of course , Tabor , " said Eden quickly , " I 'll do what I 'm told , but I 'm not worried . Now what is it all about , Mike ? " She looked directly at the embarrassed policeman , who had n't an idea she had been within hearing while he was talking . " Why , beggin ' yer pardon , Miss , it 's joist that the old un played her cards well with our matron , and she 's got out again , an ' we do n't know but she might come this way . We 're not lettin ' you out of our sight till we 're sure where she is . " " Oh ! " said Eden , looking startled , and then regaining her composure , " but she wo n't come this way again . At least I do n't think so . She wo n't take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that , " said Mike gruffly . " She knows there was does hangin ' in that there tool shed . She might take a chance to see if they is there yet . Ya see she has only prison does , and knows they might be noticed . She has got only what she had on when she got away , the matron 's apron , an ' her own dress . We know what to watch for , unless she can get a change . She did take the blanket off the grocery boy'sp169delivery truck . She might wrap that around her , but she 'd likely take any chance to get those does she hid behind the last time . " " Well , maybe , " said Eden , looking thoughtfully at Mike . " But really I think we ought not to stand here in Tabor 's room . talking . The doctor said I was to be very careful that he did n't get excited . " " The doctor knows we 're here , Miss Eden , " explained Mike . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said we might come . " " Oh , " said Eden , looking from one to another of the men . " That 's all right then , I suppose . Have you asked your ques-tions ? " " Yes , Miss Thurston , we found out all we need to know about the one that stabbed Tabor , and he saw the old un take refuge in the tool house the last time . He tried to stop her . That was how Tabor got hurt . " " All right , " said Eden cheerfully . " I 'm sorry you had to be dragged into this , but I think we ought to get right out and let Tabor go to sleep . It 's past his sleeping time now , is n't it , nurse ? " to the nurse who had entered with a worried look , and nodded in answer to Eden 's question . " Well , then , we 'll say good night and go . Tabor , you need n't worry about me . I 'll do just what Mike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and if I have to go out anywhereI 'll take somebody with me , but I wo n't go until Mike says I can . And now Tabor , you and I will remember that verse we read tonight , The angel of the Lord encampeth round about them that fear Him and delivereth them . ' Just test on that , Tabor , " and Eden gave the old servant 's hand a little pat , and a smile , and led the others away . They all came out following her as if they had been attend/ing some kind of religious service , and even the policeman walked more softly , spoke in a lower tone to Lorrimer , and kept his anxious gaze downward . Lorrimer and Mike lingered by the side doorway for a minute or two while Mike outlined the plan of defense , and noted down one or two directions which seemed important . Then Lorrimer came back to Eden in the living room . " Too bad we had to have that interruption in our pleasant evening , " said the young man as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his face than when he had left the room a few minutes before . " It 's all right , " said Eden quietly , with a faint smile , " somehowI 've felt all along that we were not through with this business yet . I 'm not surprised at anything . But I certainly am glad that you were here . " " So am I , " said the young man with a tender smile . " But you certainly are a brave girl . Most young women I know would be terribly upset by finding all this out . They told me not to let you know what was going on . They sent for me to make sure I would understand in case we heard shots , or footsteps walking around the house , and it does n't seem to worry you at all . " " Well , why should I be worried with so many good friends to guard me ? I realize of course that Mrs. Fane is an unscrupulouswoman , and rather desperate , and would n't stop at anything if she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coward . Perhaps I 'm wrong , but she would n't do anything wild like shooting somebody , or kidnaping , unless she was very sure she could get away with it . I think her role is to act like a wealthy woman who was doing a kindly deed . At least that is the way she made her approach here when she arrived "  | " Yes , " said Lorrimer thoughtfully , " that may be the way she makes her approach , innocent and kindly , but I would n't be too sure she is n't familiar with the ways of guns and the like . So please just act as if you knew she was the worst criminal living . That will make it easier for the rest of us . " " Oh , I will , " said Eden earnestly . " It is wonderful to be taken care of again . But I 'm not afraid , truly . " " " Well , of course it is grand to have courage , but remember we are taking no chances on just courage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart feel all warm and happy , and her face grew bright with a grateful smile of her own . " Now , " he said as he drew up two chairs in front of the fire , " where is that poem you promised last week you would read to me ? I 've been looking forward to hearing it ever since . " " I 'll get it , " said Eden turning to the bookcase between the windows and selecting a bright volume , with leaves that looked as if they had had much use . She turned to the old lovely words : Where the quiet-colored end of evening smilesMiles and miles , On the solitary pastures where our sheepHalf-asleepTinkle homeward through the twilight , stray or stop As they cropWas the sight once of a city great and gay ( So they say ) , Of our country 's very capital , it 's princeAges sinceHeld his court in , gathered councils , wielding farPeace or war.  |p172And  so they were off to a pleasant enjoyment and discussionof Browning . When she had finished the reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had read the poem long ago , " he said , " but you have made it live again , and painted the picture of that colored evening as I never conceived it before . And , too , it gives such a broad outlook on the world , going on through the centuries , doing all the things we are doing today , building cities , enjoyinggay times , living , sinning , fighting , loving as we do now , and dying . It makes the world seem so small after all , to think how many years it has been going on and yet our thoughts and impulses are much the same . Still the old Adam cropping up and bringing on wars . " " They had wars in Bible times , did n't they ? Does God like war ? If not , why does He allow it ? " " No , God does n't like war , but He uses it sometimes to punish His people who are sinning . He allows it to serve His own purposes . He sometimes sent different nations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had sinned against Him . He sent the Medes against Babylon to destroy it . He sent word to them to get their weapons ready . Make bright the arrows . ' You know that means to sharpen them , get them ready for use . And gather the shields together . ' They had to have bright arrows , not rusty ones that would do no good when they hit the mark . " " But how would that apply to us ? " asked Eden , puzzled . " That is , Christians . Does He want them to fight too ? " " Yes , He has told us that we are all in a warfare , not against flesh and blood , but against principalities , and powers , against the rulers of the darkness of this world . ' And He has told us to put on the whole armour of God . ' And the weaponp173we are to use is the sword of the Spirit which is the Word of God . I have always thought that that must be like the bright arrows that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use . And it has seemed to me that we should be very diligent about keeping that sword polished and ready , those arrows of God , His own Words , bright and flashing as they speed to reach the enemy . And of course the enemy is not just people who do n't agree with us , a mistake some make that causes awful trouble . The enemy is the devil who blinds and confuses people as to what is the real truth . That is why we ought to be often studying God 's Word , so that it will be on the very tips of our tongues , ready to be used at a time of need . And the Spirit will always tell us when that time has come , so that we shall not be wasting its bright flashing at an unseemly time . There will be times when the foe presses hard when a few of those bright arrows flashing through the air may bring great victory . " " That is wonderful . I 've never heard anybody bring out those thoughts before . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on my tongue , might be that , do you mean ? might speed the truth and make futile the darts of the enemy ? And with the shield of my faith in God I shall not be hurt ? " " That 's right . You have the idea . I think you had it before I spoke , for that verse you left with Tabor tonight was verily a bright arrow against the fear of worry and trouble . You know many verses like that . God will teach you when to use them . And now , how about a bit of music , some of your sweet hymns . Would n't they help Tabor to trust and not worry , and you and me , too , perhaps ? First you play some of those sweet hymns your father used to love , and then maybe we could sing :  |p174Be  not dismayed whate'er betide , God will take care of you ; Beneath His wings of love abide , God will take care of you . For answer Eden sat down at the piano and began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to love , and with which she was sure Tabor was most familiar . Lorrimer sat in the big chair near by , just in the shadow , and watched her admiringly . Eden 's face was full of feeling , for she was going back in spirit to the evenings when her dear father had sat listening , sometimes chiming in with his sweet tenor that had once been so strong and thrilling . And now after a few minutes her fingers went softly into the gospel song they both knew and their voices mingled in the tender words , " God will take care of you . " As the last note died softly away they looked up , and there stood Janet with her tray . Hot scones , tiny sponge cakes , hot chocolate topped by whipped cream . " Mr. Tabor sent ye worrud , thank ye baith fer the singin ' , an ' tae tell ye it were juist like Heaven tae hear ye . " Their faces lighted up . " We hoped he would like it , " said Eden . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " They lingered over the delicious repast , making a gala supper of the simple fare , and when Janet came back and saw that Lorrimer was about to leave , she said : " We 'll be all richt , dinna fear . Mike 's stayin ' the night hisself . " Lance Lorrimer took Eden 's hands for a brief clasp , pressingher fingers warmly , smiling into her eyes . " Good night , dear lady ! We 'll be praying ! " he said , and Janet , bless her heart , smiled to herself at the words she thought she heard with her deaf ears.  |p175FOR  several days the careful guarding of Eden went on , though they did n't say much about it to the girl herself . Mr. Worden had warned them all not to frighten Eden . But Eden was not frightened and she made them all understand that so thoroughly that even Janet realized it . Though she always insisted on going out with her whenever Eden felt she ought to go anywhere . And the police had an organized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth , they had discovered that the garments behind which Lavira had hidden in the toolroom on her first escape were gone this time , though no one had discoveredthat until the second day . The police did n't tell Eden , but they had a little something more to go on to broadcast her description than at first . And presently they discovered that a person of Mrs. Fane 's description and clad in a worn old cloak and a long green skirt and brown veil had been reported hitchhiking along a road two hundred miles to the west of Glencarroll . Another day or two brought word from watching police who had been on the alert since Lavira Fane 's disappearance from the jail , that such a woman had been picked up by a kindly farmer-couple and carried on fifty miles farther . Then silence for two days , and the report of a woman arrested for stealing garments in a store in the northwest . For by this time Lavira 's prison picture had been sent about . It was considered an important case , as there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valuable jewels which had been found on them . But there was no doubt **25;1915;TOOLONG reminded me , and I got out my mouth-harp and put in a little practice whiles I was reading the ground . But after a minute Tracker give a grunt and says , " It 's a little early in the day for whatever that is you 're doing . You do n't want to draw flies , do you ? " So I left off , willing to oblige in any way , just so 's I could stay a prentice . When we got to the sheriff 's office , the crowd was spillingout the door which must of meant they was forming a posse all right , and for pay , and because I 'd had to waste time sneaking Jigger back into the stable without Mr. Clendennon catching me and handing me a pitchfork or some busted harness , I had to get back at the end of the line , Tracker being halfway through the door already . But I was close enough to hear it all when Mr. Bastion stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gray mustache trimmed out of his mouth and his flat ranch hat on level and his big gold watch-chain with a nugget hanging on it gleaming out through the door at me and the rest of the lunkheads ready to chase his gold for him . We did n't get to see him too often , him being rich and busy and just as likely to be in Denver or San Franciscoas here where his mine was located at , but you did n't have no trouble remembering what he looked like in the meantime . He 'd been put together with no expensesspared . " You all know me , I think , " he says . ( Which was not only a safe bet but helped swell up Mayor Packwood even more whiles he steadied Mr. Bastion 's chair and scowled around to make sure nobody did n't dare accuse a bonafied millionaire of being unknown . ) " And I know most of you , " Mr. Bastion says . ( Which give the mayor and Lathropboth a chance to turn their mouth down a little asp21much as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't offer this rich man a few more mayors and bankers to look at . ) " And if I do n't know you , it 's because I do n't want to and can afford not to . " ( Which set up a little muttering chuckle amongst the crowd like they 'd sure admire to be able to say that very thing theirselves someday but did n't expect to . ) Mr. Bastion lifted the sides of his pearl-gray coat that hung down to his knees and showed his empty sides . " I do n't carry a gun because I 've got something stronger , " he says . " It shoots straighter , faster , further , louder , and a hell of a lot oftener than iron . " ( Which he did n't have to tell nobody what that was : gold , enough to own a ranch , his own railroad , and a fine hole in the ground to dig more out of if he felt like it . ) " Well , you know what 's happened , " he says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it , and I want it back . " ( Which was a pretty good guess for a description of Lud and Sooger , all right , as far as it went , but how did Mr. Bastion come to know what they did in their spare time ? ) " I do n't want them back much , I want it , " he says , like he was handing out shoot-to-kill licenses to one and all . " A dollar a day for posseying , two days ' free rations , and a bottle of the second-best whiskey between every two men for the end of the day , whether it takes that long or not , " he says , and this time the muttering was a little more dubious , that not being a whole lot of whiskey , I guess , by some standards , and the pay no more than what they 'd of got for wrangling or punching cows or turning grass upsidedown . But then he says , " And two thousand in cash for him or them that brings back the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crow about , and they commencedshoving forward to get at the sheriffs desk , and Mr. Bastion clumb down off the chair before he got trompled. )  |p22Raising  his voice over most of the racket , Lathrop says , And to that reward the First Bank of Sheepshank will add the sum of  --  " ( you could tell it pained him to have to mention maybe giving something away ) "  --  of fif  --  " ( he backed off and took another breath ) "  --  of thirty-five dollarsto whoever brings back the bullion . All of it . " He added on the last part quick , maybe to keep the mothmillersfrom holding a protest meeting in his wallet . I did n't much like being so far back in line where I might get left off and forgot , so I started squeezing along the side , saying , " Is Tracker Byrd here ? Message for Tracker Byrd , " which was n't no lie and enough to keep me feeling halfway decent whiles I passed up Studs Olsen and Sam Pollard and a couple other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me but were going to have to keep on their own toes from now on because this was Life , maybe not Every Man for Hisself , but at least I was n't going to be against myself if I could help it . I 'm a democrat , but not when I 'm waiting in line . I caught up with Tracker , who still had two ahead of him , and he looked at me like I 'd been tracking up clear ground . " What message you got for me , boy ? " he says . " Nothing much , " I says , getting wedged in good beside him and paying no mind to Ed Stalky who was right behind and frowning at me like he meant to raise hell any second . " Just  --  just I 'm here . " Tracker had his stetson pushed way back now , and he looked weary and wary , maybe ready to quit before he got started , and I remembered what he said through the crack of his door . " It may not be sundown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ payday . " He slitted his eyes . " If I was n't so thirsty , I 'd be making tracks flat on my back , " he says . And pretty soon there was nobody ahead of us , and Ip23seen Sheriff Spitzer setting behind a sheet of paper , glancingfrom Tracker to me , so before anybody could jump in and make my mistakes for me , I says , " I 'm Eli from over at the livery stable , and I can ride as good as any man in town , and this here 's Tracker Byrd , so you can just throw your troubles away . " Tracker opened his mouth , but Spitzer says , " I threw my troubles away years ago , boy . I just did n't throw them far enough . What you doing out in broad daylight , Tracker ? " " Teaching myself a lesson , " Tracker says . " How old are you , boy ? " Spitzer says to me . " Seventeen , and I 'm a prentice tracker to Tracker Byrd , and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and you can start sacking up that two thousand dollars cause we 'll be calling for it shortly , " I says , trying to act confident without spilling any on the floor . I 'd never done no bragging before and was n't sure how to do it right . " Lord Almighty , " Tracker says . Sheriff Spitzer give me a good look-over and says , " No gun , thank God . " " I do n't need no gun , " I says . " I aim to be a tracker . " He switched over to Tracker Byrd , and they stared at each other a few seconds . Then Spitzer says , " Remember : that whiskey do n't get passed out till the end of a day 's riding . If you want to lay down behind a bush someplace , you 'll have to do it dry . " He hesitated , then says , " So you decided to do something besides talk . " " Seems like you 're doing all the talking , " Tracker says . From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get our butt off the floor here . Is this a posse or ai n't it ? " The sheriff looked Tracker over some more and says , " Well , you might 's well come along . And your little dog too . In case we get shot at , the more targets we got , thep24safer . " He raised his voice at the whole bunch . " Food 'll be parsed out over at the general store , get saddled up , do n't take all day . " He scratched on the paper with a steel pen and says , " All right , Tracker , you 're on . Let 's see if you can do a better job locating bank-busters than you done on them fly-buttons this morning . " Ed Stalky commenced guffawing , but he quit when Tracker turned and give him a cold look . Whenever he done that , he did n't seem like no old man but something still and deadly and a poor sort to mess with . Then Tracker says to the sheriff very quiet and nice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Looking uncomfortable like his joke had gone a little sour on him , the sheriff tipped his chin at me and says , " Last name ? " " Well , I do n't exactly have one , " I says , feeling mortified amongst all them others listening . " Just what exactly do you have besides a high opinion of yourself ? " Spitzer says . " You can put down Clendennon if you 've got to have something , " I says , though I hated to take that on me : it made me feel like that stable up the road owned me  --  where I was going to have to go in about ten seconds and pry Mr. Clendennon loose of a horse to use on the posse . The sheriff scratched it down without no more fuss , and when I squoze out onto the boardwalk with Tracker , I could see he 'd begun having doubts about my company because he gawped everyplace , left , right , up , down , and around , except at me , so I says , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a nuisance . All 's I want to do is look and learn . " " I wish you 'd do your looking quieter , " he says , but not sounding mean about it.  | " Mr. Clendennon , " I says , " it 's the chance of a life-time . " " Maybe yours , but it 's none of mine , " he says . " Now get that body brush going on Bay Boy , I think I got Bill Millerson talked into hiring him a whole week and I want his barrel looking nice and shiny , and while you 're at it , give Mr. Sippi a tail-combing because Mr. Bastion might hire a railroad detective , and they do n't  --  " " I got powerful talents in me , and they 're never going to get no exercise if I ca n't learn , " I says . " I got to have a horse . " Mr. Clendennon had a layer of sweat all over his face from finding $2.95 in coins on his roof and from the land-office business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boys who wanted to get paid a dollar a day for chasing two thousand dollars worth of hope , and he was actually helping me saddle and cinch up Armbruster , an old paint , which was one of the three mounts we had left besides Jigger . He scowled at me serious . " That 's all just burro milk about Tracker Byrd . Nobody ever seen him do nothing but track down that cheap pop-skull over at the saloon . When he could scrounge it . Besides , I need you . Look at the business we got . " " But the business is the posse , " I says . " It 'll be gone directly . There wo n't be nothing here but horseflies in fifteen minutes . " " No , " he says , which was his favorite argument . " Grubstake me then , " I says . " I 'll be making a dollar a day , and you can have all of it , and if I get some of the reward , you can have half of that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A dollar a day , and half the reward ? " he says like ap26man who 'd just caught a whiff of perfume and had n't located the lady that went with it yet . I still had that 11  --  in my pocket but figured it would n't make no difference , him feeling so flush , so I kept aholt of it and just stood there hoping . " Well , all right , " he says , and then before I could start whooping , you can have Jigger . If nobody hires her first . " And nobody did , of course , with her coughing about every minute and looking like she 'd just had bad news . So all I had to do now was figure out how to keep up with a posse without being able to gallop or canter at all or even trot more than fifty yards at a stretch.  |p27BUT  MY JOY was too good to waste , and the day was a better gold than Mr. Bastion 's kind . I had Jigger out on the road again in five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since she 'd been getting most of her exercise chawinghay and coughing and taking a morning kick at me . I seen Tracker up ahead , trailing along behind what I counted to be eleven posse members , all headed west toward the Crockville fork where I could see the sheriff already turned around and waiting for us to bunch up . Tracker was looking at the ground , the way he done coming into town before , and I reckoned he was learning these other hoofprints the way he learnt mine , and I tried to do likewise but was too fired up to make out nothing but scuffles . Quite a few who 'd been in line at the office had n't showed up , and when I looked back , I could n't see nobody else coming , so it seemed like we was going to narrow down to the thirstiest , the foolishest , or in my case maybe the happiest . Next to Spitzer there was Sam Pollard whop28wanted to grow up to be a sheriff but did n't realize he was already growed up and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had n't liked what was going on in the sheriffsoffice and did n't look like he 'd changed his mind out here , and Bill Millerson who sure enough was on Bay Boy and must of galloped up the back path , and Tracy Watkins with his derby on tight and his butt too far back in the saddle looking like he wished he was back at the bank counting change with his celluloid cuff-protectors on , and old Sidney Burl who 'd ride anywhere anybody else was going just for the company , and Studs Olsen , scowling at me for probably being too dang young for all this since he had me beat by three months ( we was racing to be twenty-one years old someday , and he was scairt I might pass him by ) , and Willy Steels , the extra barber , who did n't have nothing better to do , and John " Sideview " Davis who I had once seen ( I used the underneath of the Mercury 's swinging doors for a spyhole ) drink ten straight shots of bar whiskey in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting a spur hooked under the rail before he could get the last glass set back down and thereby laying hisself out in the same position as the naked lady in the painting over the mirror , and Smitty the cook from over at the Sullivans ' ranch that always had burns all over his hands like he 'd just as leave cook hisself as anything else , and Patricia Ferris 's older brother Charley who did n't have one-fourth what she had up front or out behind or between the ears neither , and Deputy Morse who had a gunnysack of what looked to be whiskey bottles tied onto his saddlehorn , and Tracker , and me . And there , coming cross-country in half a hurry from the gully-and-boulder country up southwest was Lud and Sooger , big and bold as you please , their face washed and their hat on straight and no gunpowder burns noticeablep29and , unless my eyes deceived me , not riding the same horses I 'd seen them on at daybreak . They joined the clump of us and started talking to Deputy Morse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and told about the robbery , and Lud and Sooger acted like they did n't know nothing about it . " Where you been , Lud ? " the sheriff says , not looking any too pleased they 'd come along . " Prospecting gopher holes ? " " Hunting pronghorn , " Lud says nice and easy . He was leaner and longer and a little darker and less jumpier than Sooger who never left off moving his hands hither and yon , always touching hisself and his belongings to make sure they had n't flew off in the last couple seconds . " Seen two or three men , maybe riding hard ? " the sheriffsays . " No , " Lud says , and Sooger shook his head . They had rifle butts sticking out of saddle-scabbards , but I had a feeling the pronghorns had n't had no difficulty this morning . Spitzer looked all around from face to face , counting noses , and then flattened his mouth down like he 'd just as leave do this by hisself , but raised his hand all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I hereby deputizeall present for the purposes of search-and-seizure in the County of Larimer connection with robbery of First Bank of Sheepshank till further notice by the authority given me by said county now listen here : they got at least three hours ' start on us . They headed this way and must of gone either west or south , be damned if I know which in dusty weather like this . So we might 's well split in two here . Them that feels like rimrocking can go west , and them that feels like going to Crockville can go south . " Everybody started muttering it over , but when I seenp30Tracker walk his horse alongside the west fork about twenty yards , staring down like he 'd lost something , then cross over to the south fork and circle back , I joined up with him and tried to check what he was checking but did n't see nothing much except eighteen kind of pebbles and the usual spread of weeds and enough dusty clay per square yard to make a hundred-foot-tall dust devil any windy day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peeved , and he says , " ' Less our fearless trackers here got a better idea . " Some was saying West and some was saying South like they was choosing up sides for a game of kick-the-lardpail , and Tracker says very soft , " I reckon it do n't make no difference which way we go . " And I give him a close look to see if he 'd got it figured out already which did n't seem possible , but who was I to say ? In a big loud voice Lud says , " I 'm for Candy Kate 's , and to hell with scratching gravel . Let 's go south to Crockville . " A half a dozen others give a yip at that , and Sooger says , " Was n't none of my money in that bank . " Keeping reined in and for some reason starting to watch Tracker 's face like he seen something there , the sheriff says , " Well , old-timer , it 's west or south or maybe split-the-difference . What 'll it be ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't sposed to know nothing and had n't been asked , but before I could stop , I says , " West . " Tracker give me one of them tight little smiles again and says , " I believe I 'll try west for a spell . " Already sounding like he was half in charge , Lud says ,  | " Well , Deputy Morse has got the snake water , and Morse is heading for Crockville , right ? " " That 's right , " Morse says like he did n't much care one way or the other . The bunch that split off was everybody but me and Tracker and Sheriff Spitzer and Sam Pollard , who was trying to do everything Spitzer done including spitting on time . " Come on , even it out a little , " the sheriff says . " I 'll need another gun going this way . " Sooger give Tracy Watkins 's horse a slap on the croup , and he jolted forward and come trotting around to the back of our westbound clump with the butt of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lud says , " I 'll bet them desperadoes is up on the second floor at Candy Kate 's already , and we 'll have to search it good and proper . " All right , suit your own selves , boys , " the sheriff says . " And no use fighting over the reward . All 's we got to do is keep up like this , and we 'll stretch this posse out for two thousand days and all get rich . " But his sperits sounded low . " You 're in charge of that end , Morse , whichever end that might happen to be . " " Yes , sir , " Deputy Morse says . " Spose we could manage one jug of that dust-cutter ? " Tracker says kind of apologetic . " Just to start the cook fire ? " Spitzer went riding over to Morse 's gunnysack and yanked out two bottles and stuffed them into his own saddlebag without dismounting , and with Lud and Soogerwhooping it up like a couple of chute roosters , the bigger group went dusting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the long slope that turned more and more broke-up and steep ahead and finally purple and jagged way in the distance . Then we started along slow without no orders , not saying nothing , and fell into a kind of natural order withouteven figuring it out : after a hundred yards , Tracker was first in line and the sheriff was second , having fell back by a neck and going alongside the road instead of on it , and I was third , no matter how hard Sam tried to nose me out and bump me out of place , and Tracy brung up the rear because you could see he was half a mind to head back for town except he was afraid what Lathrop would do to him for not being out here trying to save the bank that $35 reward . Talking ahead at the sheriff , Sam says , " We was right , was n't we ? We picked the right road , did n't we ? " soundingall fluxed up and worried . " Hush , boy , and you might learn something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own share of road-reading , and then with a brand-new funny note of respeck in his voice , he says to Tracker , " Pretty clear , ai n't it ? " Without lifting his head , Tracker says , " Sheriff , we 're sliding the groove . " " Three of them , right ? " Spitzer says , not sounding too sure . Tracker nodded , then let his head turn half-backwards following a stretch of sign in a harder patch of deepbrownclay where a puddle had dried off , and I paid specialmind to it as it come past me , seeing the cleaner , sharper hoof-cuts here and there . When he was all the way by it hisself , Tracker turned in a quick circle and come riding through that patch at a canter , scaring Tracy 's nervous little chestnut filly out amongst the loose rock that was commencing to crop up around us . Thenp33Tracker come back again , slow as ever , looking at his own prints . " How much worth of gold ? " Tracker says , looking puzzled . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he says as respeckful as he might to a judge , " Thirty thousand , about . " Tracker went along quiet for a minute , seeming to calculate , then says , " Eighty , maybe eighty-five pound . " He shook his head . " This here meat-and-potatoes dirt ai n't too good , but it ai n't that bad . " He frowned and went moving along again . No wind . Not a cloud . And Jigger had mostly quit coughing and was doing what I wanted her to do , long as I was being reasonable about it , and I felt like I was getting some kind of lesson all right , but could n't figure out what it was . I knew who we was chasing  --  or two out of three anyways  --  but I could n't see how they 'd come to be turned back on us and now headed for Crockville with a load of bar business and bad news . And I knew Tracker was seeing things I could n't see , so the first chance I got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slow , how to open my eyes up . So far , all 's I 'd learnt was that getting a lesson was n't the same as turning smart . After a couple miles Tracker stopped and just set there thinking , hauling one leg up crossways on his saddle , and we all stopped and milled around , sweating , and finally the sheriff says , " Where do you think they 're headed ? " Tracker aimed his chin up slope toward the mountains . " Slow country , " he says . And Sam says , " How 's come you let all the others go south when you knew it was west , sheriff ? " " I 'll give you a little rule of the thumb to go by , boy , "  |p34S|pitzer  says . " You 'll get to know a few gents like Lud and Sooger Worley and Ed Stalky and Bill Millerson someday , and every time they want to do something  --  or want you to do something  --  just go do the opposite , and you 'll keep your teeth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , sir , " Sam says . " I understand . " " Oh , you do , do you ? " the sheriff says . " Well , if you understand so much , maybe you can tell me why you 're going to wipe your chin off now . " Sam wiped his mouth on his sleeve and says , " I do n't know . " " That 's exactly right , " the sheriff says . " Are we going to take some time off to eat soon ? " Tracy says . " I did n't have time for breakfast , and my wife usually  --  " " The jerky 's in my saddlebag , " Spitzer says . " Help yourself . " " Oh . " Tracy shifted his rear-end around in the dish of his saddle . " I believe I 'll wait a while . " Spitzer nodded at Tracy and Sam like they was just about what he 'd expected , then glanced at me . " Any questionsor complaints ? " he says . " No , sir , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mare 's offhinderhoof for thrush if you do n't want her going lame by next week . And I 'd like to ask Tracker if he thinks we 're in a hurry . " I was worried about Jigger 's lungs and did n't know what in the wide world I 'd do if I had to try galloping her . " No big hurry , " Tracker says , looking down at the road like he was glancing over last month 's newspaper . " Some reason , these boys did n't calculate on being trailed . Or did n't care . But they 're long-hauling now . We 're going to be camping out . "  |p35Tracy  groaned , but turned it into a throaty little hack and fanned hisself with his derby . " Gon na earn your dollar there , boy , " the sheriff says , and when we started moving , he checked Tracker from behind , probably seeing what I seen : a round-shouldered , raggedy-shirted , scuffed-up , gray-haired man with a bashed hat and a horse even Jigger could race , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might possibly have some notion what you 're looking at , Tracker . " Which was my opinion too . " Confound it , " Tracy says , low and hard from behind me , which was probably the class of swearing they allow in them teller 's cages where they do n't have no elbow room . But I was worried now for fear Tracker might of missed something , because we was aiming further and further out of what seemed like ought to be our way . Yet I kept my eyes on the baked ground , figuring sooner or later it 'd begin making sense the way the first page of McGuffey 's Eclectic Reader finally done after I 'd near wore it through , running my finger under the lines and puzzling out the mess you could make with the alphabet . We went on all afternoon up into boulder country and camped near a stream about as wide as a horse trough , me getting worrieder and worrieder because Lud and Soogercould n't in no manner nor by no means have went this far and got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tracker was making a big mistake , how could I be learninganything but how to do it wrong ? There was n't no road now , just open country , so if you let your eye wander off a second to watch a bee or glance up to make sure the sun had n't started backing up , you could lose your signp36completely . If Tracker had n't been riding point , we 'd of lost them sure . Whiles the others sat down , leaning back against their saddle with their boots off , I took my mouth-harp up the crick a ways out of respeck for human ears . But before I was out of ear-shot , I heard Sam say , " How 's come we ca n't have no fire ? We could shield it good . " Sounding like a tired old school teacher , the sheriff says , " If smoke gets on that up-country breeze , it 'll head right for where they 're probably at . Wait for dark , the breeze 'll set down , you 'll get your goddamn beans . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had just tried to deposit a bunch of brass in the drawer where the greenbacksgo . I followed the crick a ways , then branched off to where we 'd left off the trail , and I was standing there looking at them little dents and scrapes in the dirt that was n't explainingnothing to me but my ignorance and blowing a few quiet notes now and then and beginning to see less and less as it turned dusk , when Tracker come up behind me and says , " Leave them signs alone , boy . They wo n't get up and walk off in the night . " " I 'm trying to figure out how they done it , " I says , not thinking beforehand , which is the best time to . " How who done what ? " Tracker says . I looked around at the boulders and stumps and dry brush , trying to change the subject , then looked up and over at the mostly clear sky where all the color and stray clouds and light was getting hauled westward , then scowled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " It ai n't going to rain , " Tracker says . " How can you tell that ? " I says.  | " Take a deep breath through your mouth , " he says . " That 's if you can keep that contraption out of it long enough . " Meaning my mouth-harp which I stuck away and then done like he said . The air tasted like the kind you steer clear of downwind of a grass fire but without the smoke . " Now hold your hand about two inches off and blow at it , " he says . " Slow . " I done so . " Feel any damp ? " he says . I rubbed my fingers together , and the calluses was still as dry and hard as old harness . " No , " I says . " Then it ai n't going to rain , " he says . I 'd half expected he was funning me , like when you say to somebody Open your mouth and close your eyes , and then the big surprise turns out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worse , but this seemed like a genuine piece of information , so I says , " I thank you kindly . " Even though it was getting too low-shadowed and scattery-lightedto see much , he touched one of the hoofprints we was following with the toe of his boot and traced a line under it and took a dab at it , same as somebody might show you some flowers they was trying to grow but had their doubts about . " Something funny going on , " he says . I held still , thinking maybe he 'd got onto it and was going to turn back and round up Lud and Sooger , but he did n't say nothing else , just give a shake like he was getting the flies off his withers , then started back toward the others . We was all setting up against our saddle now , with the small , dry-willow campfire guttering down to nothing in front of us and our stomach full of Colorado blackberries ,  |p38which  is what they call navy beans back where they have enough sense not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and thick as coffee . Tracker pulled one stick out of the coals and dunked the smoky end in the dust till it quit and then says , " They 're going to smell that up slope if they should happen to have such a thing as a nose . " " I had to feed my loyal and brave deputies something besides hope , did n't I ? " Spitzer says , scrouched back flat with his ankles crossed and his hands folded on his belly that showed even when it was n't hanging . " Besides , not everybody 's got a nose like you , Tracker . I heard you was second cousin to a bloodhound . " Sounding like he had took no offense , Tracker says , " I would n't put it past my kinfolk , sheriff . I know for a fact they been out in the woods with bloodhounds . Without no chaperone . " " How old are you , Mr. Byrd ? " Tracy says like he was set to fill out a blank for life insurance . " I had it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Tracker says . " Are Indians issued regular birth certificates ? " Tracy says . " Not as a general rule , " Tracker says , staying mild about it . " Saves keeping track when they get kilt . " " Tracy , why do n't you go count your pennies someplace ? " the sheriff says , giving Tracker half a shrug for an apology . He set up and yanked one of the whiskey bottles out of his saddlebag and says , " Tracker , got any suggestions how to pass out this medicine donated by the Cherry Mining Company , Incorporated ? " " The sooner gone , the less to quarrel over , " Tracker says . " Good idea , " the sheriff says , uncorking . " I 'll be bar/dog , and I rule two-for-one in favor of them with gray hair . " He took a long slug and handed it over to Tracker who took an even longer slug and passed it back . " It wo n't stop up your nose , will it ? " " That ai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give it a second pull and then taking his own again . " Save some for me , " Sam says . Spitzer took the bottle back and give it to Sam , then had to wrench it off him when he tried to slug too long , and while Sam was leaning forward to cough , the sheriff give it to Tracy . Cleaning off the neck with a little half-size wipes as white as a bedsheet , Tracy says , " Against the night air , " like his wife or Lathrop might be spying . " What 've you got against it ? " I says , while he tipped it up for a quick one . " How about you , boy ? " the sheriff says , holding the bottle over at me . " Reckon I 'll do without , " I says . The sheriff checked the label by the flickering red light and says , " Whoo ! What do they make this out of ? " Sam had slowed down his coughing , and before Tracker took his turn , he toasted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a peaceful smile and says , " Bumblebees , sheriff . Bumblebees . And they all know their way home to the hive . " He tilted it up like a bugler playing his music backwards . Sam had went to sleep after trying to drink up the crick , and Tracy had put a little distance betwixt him and us before rolling up in his bedroll and tilting his derby against the glow from the firecoals , and a slanderous tongue might say the sheriff had passed out since he donep40it in the middle of what was sposed to be a sentence , but Tracker was still laying there , taking his ease with about three inches left in the bottom of the second bottle ( they 'd decided it was no use saving it for a rainy day since the clouds did n't look any too promising ) , and I went on explainingmyself to him like I 'd been doing for about ten minutes . " So I always admired you because everybody kept saying what a good tracker you was , and you did n't even seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I says . " Who 's ever going to say , My , oh my , what a good hay-shaker that Eli is ' ? No matter what kind of a way your name come up  --  for fighting or drinking or being ornery , no matter what  --  they 'd always say , Yeah , but I hear tell he 's a real trail-nose , he 's big medicine on the hunt . ' And it seemed like to me , all 's a man had to do was be topnotch at something , and it made up for everything else . You was my example . " " I 'll try to bear up under that load , son , " Tracker says , sounding sleepy and slurry . He did n't say nothing else , so I tried a little " Old MacDonald " on my mouth-harp , keeping the noise down best I could . " Ai n't you spreading your talent a little thin with that thing ? " Tracker says like he was more woke up than he 'd care to be . " Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shifted his legs and put in some more work on the bottle . " Well , I do n't have a real firm opinion on it yet , but I 'm working on one , " he says . " That 's my ten-hole Gebruder Ludwig-Richter Prairie Queen Harmonica , " I says . He yawned . " Sounds like a heap of responsibility . " " I 'm learning myself two or three tunes off of thep41player-piano over at the Mercury , " I says . " But I keep getting them mixed up . " " I figured something was wrong , " he says . " Playing helps me think . " He took a deep sigh , and I heard the bottle clink and roll off behind somewheres . " And just what do you think about when you get settled down to it good ? " he says . Even though he did n't sound too interested , I says , " The Future . " He groaned and rolled over , and the sheriff give a groan like an echo and then commenced snorting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MacDonald " around it , but he left off too quick and fell asleep again . I did n't much like that song anyway because the part they keep repeating reminded me of " Eli , Eli , oh ! " and made me wonder what kind of animal I was and where I fitted in this big barnyard . What I 'd told Tracker had n't been the whole honest truth . I was n't exactly thinking of the Future but the night-time , though sometimes they got mixed up together . Since I 'd started riding Mr. Clendennon 's horses in the night , I 'd been different . Something strange had been growing in my mind . I was n't scairt of it because I knew it was part me , yet it was part horse too , a real daisy-cutter , what they call a long horse because it can go a long , long ways and not lose no speed and breathe just as easy , not some ridge-runner stallion neither that wants to fight everything it sees or else own it , but something as dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remainders of the fire . And where it was going to take me if I ever made so bold as to get on its back , I did n't know . A nighthawk come swooping and zigzagging over , though I could n't see him , giving his sharp , short cry whiles he caught his fill of bugs and whatever else wasp42flying up there , and I tried making a cry like that on my mouth-harp , but it did n't work right , so I left off for fear of waking everybody up mad at me . And then I give up and laid back , and though somemight call it turning in , I did n't do that . I went out into that good night just like I was riding or flying.  |p43AND  I DO N'T KNOW WHY they call them nightmares neither , but whoever made that one up was right and must of been someone like me , because that 's what mine turned into  --  a horse with too many hooves going under it and getting louder . And the very second I jerked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But there was Tracker crouched on the ground with his ear jammed flat against the dirt , and Spitzer had commencedfloundering awake , and when I turned sideways and done like Tracker with my own ear , I heard it again , further off than it 'd been in my dream , but the same deep rumbling like a bunch of hearts going too fast to keep separate track of . I seen the sheriff knock his own hat off shoving his ear against the ground , and after a few seconds he says , " It 's too many to be the bank boys , ai n't it ? " " And the wrong direction , " Tracker says . He did n't look worried , but he took out his sixgun and checked it over , and the sheriff done the same , and about that timep44Sam woke up and fought a draw in a rassling match with his blanket , and when he seen Spitzer had his gun out , he took a dive for hisn . II " Do n't sprain nothing important , " Spitzer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saddle and started flashinglooks in five or six directions , and then the sheriff had to tilt Sam 's muzzle away from where it was pointing at his leg . " Anything I 'm sposed to do ? " I says to Tracker , benefittingby Sam 's bad example and not having no gun to get in trouble with anyway . " Well , you can make some coffee , " Tracker says . " If that ai n't beneath all that talent of yours . " " How do you make coffee ? " I says . The hoofbeats wasII loud enough to hear without using the ground now , and Spitzer and Sam had stood up to face back southeast where it was coming from . " First , you get the fire going and boil some water , I believe , " Tracker says . " But do n't ask me past that becausemine 's no good . Make up your own kind . " So I broke up some sticks and had just managed to blow the last few coals back to life when Mr. Bastion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lud and Sooger rode up toward us like they 'd come a long ways , lathered and dusty and all needing a good work-over with a sweatscraperas bad as their horses . I went on building up the fire , since that was what Tracker told me and I did n't have nothing better to do . " Well , I 'm glad we found you gents , " Mr. Bastion says . Spitzer and Tracker had both put their guns away , and Spitzer had showed Sam how to get hisn back in his holster , and Tracy had woke up in time to keep banker 's hours in the middle of the commotion , looking like hep45was ashamed the way his dark-blue suit pants had snuck up on him in the night . " If we 'd known you was looking , we 'd of run up a flag , " Spitzer says . " What 's the matter , Mr. Bastion ? " " The robbers have been traced down south of Crockville , two of them , and got themselves shot in a fight with the sheriff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , talkingfirm and big-voiced and calm-seeming , but the sweat was streaking down his face and did n't match . " The reward'salready been spoke for , so you might as well head for home . " Spitzer was standing dead still , looking puzzled . " Who were they ? " From the back , Lud says , " Who knows ? Just dead meat now . " Mr. Bastion says , " Well , the important thing is  --  " " You got your gold back ? " the sheriff says . " The important thing is you do n't have to keep the posse going , " Mr. Bastion says . " You can all head for Sheepshank and collect your wages . " I had the fire all blowed and fanned up now , so I took the frying pan , which was n't too handy to use but least did n't have no Colorado blackberries gummed in the bottomlike the deeper pan , and went over and dipped up some crick water . Shifting and looking around from Deputy Morse to Tracker and off at some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sure was nice of you to come all the way out here just to put us easy . Did you say you got your gold back ? " Doing a little tree-inspecting hisself , Mr. Bastion says , " I believe some of it has been recovered . " " All the way out here just to save maybe four dollarsp46wages , " Spitzer says like he was memorizing a good one . " What do you mean by that , Spitzer ? " Mr. Bastion says , using a quiet , hard , quartz-cracking kind of voice . " Nothing , " the sheriff says , not even bothering to act innocent . Mr. Bastion made a great show of getting down off his high horse , a lovely , sleek , apron-faced bay gelding , maybe a little too cow-hocked to be entirely proud of , and he says , " These men volunteered to ride all the way from Crockville just to keep you from going on a wild goose chase . " The sheriff looked like he begged leave to doubt it but did n't say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Sooger hanging off in the back , being as they was n't exactly known for their charitable deeds except maybe now and then putting critters out of their misery which they had happened to put in their misery in the first place . " I 'd think you 'd be grateful , " Mr. Bastion says . And the first thing you want to do if you 're making coffee is not spill half the water out before you get the pan set on the fire right and have to go back and get some more . " Guess maybe you wanted to catch them two robbers yourself , sheriff , " Lud says . " Thousand dollars a head , " Sooger says , chuckling . " Gone like the winter snow . " " Plus seventeen-fifty each , " Tracy says . " What happened to the other robber ? " I says , and then come to notice I was attracting a good deal of attention . " What other robber ? " Mr. Bastion says very solemn . " What makes you think there was three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smile measuring about an inch-and-ahalfby one-sixteenth.  | " Two , " Mr. Bastion says . " Two of them got themselves shot down in Crockville . " " What makes you think there was three ? " Sooger says , showing how quick he could pick up on what his brother showed him . They was all looking at me now and waiting , and I did n't want to tell no lies , not even if I had to , so I let out part of it and says , " I seen them . " Sort of half to hisself , Lud says , " He sleeps up over the livery stable . " Rubbing his hands together and talking brisk , Mr. Bastionsays , " Two or three  --  it does n't matter . The important thing is the gold . " " Which you got back , " the sheriff says . " That 's my business , Spitzer , " Mr. Bastion says . " If I 'm satisfied , why are n't you ? " Lud come up close to me where I was tending the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else did you see , boy ? " " Well , I was kind of sleepy , " I says . " Of course you was , " Lud says . " Maybe you was n't even awake , " Sooger says , coming up too . Tracker had just set there the whole time , and now he was looking at me kind of narrow , and the sheriff walked over and says , " You saw the men leaving the bank ? After the explosion ? " " Yes , sir , " I says . " Why did n't you say so before ? " the sheriff says . " Well , I did n't want to spoil none of the fun , " I says . " What fun ? " Mr. Bastion says , which just goes to showyou what too much gold does . I felt myself blushing and glanced at Tracker , not want/ing to talk about being a prentice at the moment . It gets kind of complicated , " I says . " Luckily it 's all settled now , " Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidently thinking two dead men as being excused from harm , and he had a point there . And the second thing you do n't want to do if you 're making coffee is get your hand in the water when it 's commencing to boil , and I straightened up and yells , " Dag drat it ! " loud enough to blow a straw hat through a barn door . Sam got a laugh out of it , but Mr. Bastion stayed solemn . " Let 's all get on home and tend to business , " he says . " If they headed down to Crockville , the two of them , how 's come we been following signs of three of them out this way ? " the sheriff says , slow and reasonable . Lud tipped his nose at Tracker . " You been listening to old Tracker Byrd ? " he says . " No wonder you 're lost . " " I can do a little cutting for sign myself , " the sheriff says . " Three . This way . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selves , " Sooger says . Using his big business voice , Mr. Bastion says , " I 'm disbanding this posse and ordering it back to Sheepshank , Mr. Spitzer . " I seen the sheriff thinking it over for a few seconds , maybe wanting to ask how Mr. Bastion come to be elected mayor and marshal and prosecutor and what-all overnight and probably already knowing the answer , and so finally he just says , " Aw , come on , have some grub . It 's no good , but at least there ai n't much of it . " And the third thing you do n't want to do is spill all the coffee grinds in at once instead of eking them out little by little so 's you can figure how strong you want it.  | " We 've already eaten , " Mr. Bastion says after looking over what was going on in the only two pans we had . Tracy had saddled his horse , all eager to get back to civilization where you could keep track of people with numbers instead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy he 'd probably of give me change for a dollar if I 'd had one . As soon as the sheriff shrugged and begun cinching up , Sam done so too . But Tracker just kept setting there , enjoying the morning and not seeming to pay much mind to all this unexpected company , so I did n't do nothing either . When Mr. Bastion seen we was n't rolling up our blanketsand breaking camp , he come over and stood next to Tracker 's sprawled-out boots and says , " Are you drunk , sir ? " " Not so 's you 'd notice , " Tracker says . " More 's the pity . " " Then stand up when you 're addressing me , " Mr. Bastionsays . Tracker straightened his legs out more or less but did n't stand up . " I was n't addressing nobody , " he says . " Well , what 's the matter with you then ? " Mr. Bastion says . " Depends on who 's asking , " Tracker says . " I got enough the matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a move on , " Mr. Bastion says , including me with a little sweep of his eyes . " We 're in no hurry , " Tracker says . " I 'm learning this young man to be a tracker , so I thought maybe we 'd do a little pirooting around out here for a spell . " " There ai n't nothing to find , " Sooger says , but Lud hushed him . " Just for practice , " Tracker says calm and offhand . " If we ca n't find nothing better , we 'll backtrack ourself. "  | " I 'm ordering you back to town , " Mr. Bastion says . " Both of you . " Tracker did n't move . " I did n't know that mining companyof yours stretched all the way out here , " he says . " You wo n't get your pay for posseying , " Mr. Bastion says . The sheriff and Sam and Tracy had mounted up , but Tracker did n't look at them . He studied his thick , blunt brown fingernails and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little prospecting while we 're at it and strike it dumb-lucky rich like you . " " Where 's your pick and shovel ? " Lud says . " Some needs an anchor and banjo and some does n't , " Tracker says . All of a sudden Mr. Bastion seemed to make up his mind he 'd done enough talking , and he swung up into his saddle and rode off set-faced , and the rest of them swung around to catch up , kicking a cloud of dust for us to enjoy , which must of meant there had n't been no dewfall to speak of . And one of the other things you do n't want to do to coffee is try covering up your mistakes with sugar because it turns out most people like the taste of coffee and it do n't need to be candied over like you 'd expect . It had turned kind of thick in the pan and mahogany-colored , and Tracker dipped some out in a tin cup , muttering to hisself and still mad at Mr. Bastion and making up things he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He cooled it off a little by blowing at it , then took a good sip with his eyes looking off at the tail end of the posse that was n't a posse no more , and then he give a gasp and took a clutch at his chest and swallered two or three times and commenced staring at me.  | " I 'm sorry , " I says , feeling worried . " I never made none before , and you told me  --  " " Well , it may not be coffee , but it sure as hell 's something , " he says , perking up and flush in the face and taking another sip . " Son , you could spread this out and cut it up in squares and show that Bastion a thing or two about making money . " " I thank you kindly , " I says . " And now I 'm going to show him a thing or two about giving people orders he had n't no right to , " he says , all of a sudden jumping up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was all the posse 'd left behind . " Atiniehi-nina ! " he yells in a scrawky , wild voice . " Atini-ehi-nina ! " It done to me what the coffee done to him , and I must of been gaping because he simmered down when he seen the look on my face . " I was just telling that damn Bastion I was a bird , " he says . " I only say it when I need reminding myself . " He did n't say what kind of bird , but I come to find out it must of been one with good eyes.  |p52WE  GOT UP into slopier country by midday , still taking our sweet time , by ourself now and not worried about whose opinion was this or that or what Sam or Tracy was going to complain about next , but just the sheer pleasure of watching Tracker work , and I was beginning to get some of the idea what he was doing . Most of the time , the trail was so clear even I could of followed it , but when it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stand of grass  --  Tracker 'd always stop and take a good sight along the way it was going , sometimes dismounting and crouching to look along the grass-tops and tilting his head or walking halfway around it to get the sun behind him , and I invariably done likewise . Then he 'd point to the shade and the line of changed color in the slightly bent grass heads or here and there the scuffed twigs on the brush , not even broke but bent enough to notice , and he never said much but expected me to know what he meant , and I guess I did mostly . He snuffed the air about every minute , and I tried itp53too but did n't get nothing but a nose-whistle out of it . " What 're we trying to smell ? " I says . " Whatever they got to offer , " he says . Maybe he was checking for camp smoke , but I did n't have enough hound in me for it . And then he found the first horse apples since before our camp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them the way he 'd done the day before when we was still posseying : he dismounted and went over and stepped on one slow and deliberate , taking his foot off of it halfway through to check the results , which was about what you might expect , but he seemed fretted and disappointed . Anybody 's worked around a stable much as me has stepped on them things many a time , and it ai n't too much trouble to tell old ones from new ones . But Tracker says , " Yesterday " like he 'd expected somethingbetter . " See the cracks ? " " And no flies , " I says . I had already done my homework on horse apples though mostly with a pitchfork and straw . He nodded and says , " And no flies on you neither , boy , " and give me a small smile , which was about the third one I 'd earned . We rode another quarter mile and come to the big scene : we was on a patchy dry-grass slope near the start of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and this was the first time there 'd been much in the way of scuffling and circling among the tracks . The horses had muddled around in a circle the size of a front parlor , like the riders had parleyed and maybe had trouble making up their mind . But three sets of tracks headed out of the mess , aiming south now toward the gully . Tracker rode along beside the southbound tracks ap54ways , leaning way over the side of his horse , then come back looking amused like he admired what he seen . " Well , boy , " he says . " Spose you tell me what we 're inspectinghere . " I dismounted and walked around a while , trying not to step on nothing important , and got down on my hunkers and considered and spit and tipped my hat back and walked along the southbound tracks and come back to the westbound ones we 'd been following and felt squirmy because he was watching me . " Ai n't you going to play that mouth-harp ? " he says . " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's still the three of them , one wearing shoes , one wearing brand-new slippers , and one wearing wore-out boots . It 's the slippers that puzzle me . Who 'd want to bring a horse up in this kind of country hoofed with slippers , new or not ? Does n't make sense , even though it 's a damn good clear-footed horse that 'd just as leave jump anything it can see over as walk around it . But now they 're all three headed for Crockville , and it just do n't  --  " I had to shut myself off , not because he was chuckling at me but because I come near to mentioning Lud and Sooger and did n't want to . Tracker shook his head at me . " You 'll do , " he says . " For a starter , anyways . Now take another look . " He was glancing all around the country like he 'd lost interest in the signs , and I went back over everything again but not finding nothing new but a chipped tooth in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a pebble that had found its way in amongst the Colorado blackberries last night . Finally Tracker says , " All right , you tried . Now just listen to me : I wish we 'd come this much further last night . I suspicioned all day yesterday we was following more horses than men . " He commenced staring at sloped/up table rock about fifty yards west of us . " Come on over here a minute . " He swung off his horse and started leading him toward the rock , and I done the same . " But they did n't come this way , " I says . We was on a stretch of scrabbly hardpan short of the slab of rock , and when I looked back , not even us and our horses walking careless was making enough sign to follow . All of a sudden Tracker stopped about halfway and says , " Son , I got a bad habit of getting into trouble , and I got a feeling I 'm about to get in some more . You sure you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest of them fearless Sheepshankers ? " " I 'm your prentice , " I says , not telling him I probably could n't catch up with a ox wagon on Jigger , though she 'd cut down on her coughing a good deal and seemed willing to chaw on any brush or buffalo grass she had a chance to . " Let me put it to you serious , " he says . " All right , you 're chasing some bank robbers . What had you figured on doing when you caught up with them ? " " Why , I do n't know , " I says , shamed to admit I 'd been thinking more about improving myself and cutting for sign than anything else . It was a beautiful day , and the sun made every crack , stick , grassblade , weed-stalk , and rock-edge , near and far , look like it was fit to bust , just for the sheer pleasure of being itself and not shaped like nothing else nor colored the same nor standing or laying the same way . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Take them into custody , I reckon . " " Where 's that at ? " Tracker says . " Where 's that custody located at ? " I tried to be patient with him . " I mean back to Sheepshankso 's they can get a fair trial for bank-busting. "  | " What if they do n't happen to feel like doing that and tell you to go stick yourself up the nearest gulch ? " he says , studying my face up close now like he was looking for sign on it . So I played along and tried to imagine something for him , even though I knew Lud and Sooger was miles away and no particular trouble . " Well , I can tie them up and drag them , " I says , picturing it and already knowing it did n't sound too good . " Long as there was n't too many for one rope . " " Reckon they 'd just hold still while you done that tying up ? " Tracker says . " You mean I got to hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , you can do that part . You got the gun . " " I thank you kindly , " he says , doing a good job imitatingmy voice . I went along a little further with it , trying to imagine what it 'd be like . " But they 'd know we 'd figured out who they was and where they was at . We 'd have them dead to rights . " " Eli , Eli , " he says , shaking his head and , far as I could recall , remembering my name for the first time and making me feel good . " If a bullet goes in one side of your head , " he said , " it do n't matter if it can find its way out the other side or not . Its mere presence in your head 's confusing . Keeps you from thinking straight . " I was n't following him any too good now , since I had n't calculated on being shot at . " Why 'd they want to go shootingjust over a little money ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money , ai n't you ? " he says . But I had him there . " No , I ai n't , " I says . " I 'm doing it for practice . And fun . " Tracker started walking his horse toward that sloping slab of rock again . " You start having fun with otherp57people , you better be sure they do n't turn out funnier than you , " he says . But I could tell he was going to let me tag along with him which was all I cared about , and when we come to the place where the hardpan left off and the rock started  --  where there was a twisty old pine tree not much taller'n us that looked like it had n't made up its mind whether to grow up , down , or sideways but had tried them all and did n't like none of them much and had just decided to hang on now and shove out a few needles and take it easy and think it over and the hell with it  --  Tracker knelt down by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Put your foot down there . Full weight . " So I braced one boot on the hardpan and lunged against the rock with the other a couple times without scraping , half-expecting to see my footprint sunk into stone , but there was n't no trace of anything . " What do you see ? " Tracker says . I looked again to make sure , then knelt even closer than him and looked some more and says , " Nothing , " expecting to be wrong and made a fool of but not minding because that 's what you have to do if you mean to work yourself up into being somebody different and not no dignified penny-stacker . " Now come on over here , " Tracker says and moved off closer to the pine tree where the rock had a different color and , come to notice , dusty-looking little dead moss ow something , thin and no-account , unless you was searchingfor it apurpose . " Do it again here , " Tracker says . And I give it my footprint treatment , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't no sign of anything . " Now what do you see ? " he says.  | " Still nothing , " I says , beginning to wonder was he all right in the head or getting too far from the whiskey . " Come on back here , " he says and went back to the place I 'd stepped on first , least what seemed like the place because there was n't no mark on it . He knelt again and started blowing on the bare rock from up close like he was cooling his soup . He done that three times . And he did n't have to tell me to look : there was six or seven lighter , scratchier places on the stone , close together , that had n't been there before . Then he went to the second place by the pine tree and pointed where I 'd tried to make a footprint ( I do n't think I could of located it myself ) and says , " Blow . " I done like he said , and a lot of little-bitty flecks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and after I 'd blew five or six times , there was a fair outline of my bootsole . He stood me off a couple paces , which made the print even clearer , and says , " All rock 's got a skin on it , even when it looks bare as a schoolmarm 's  --  well , even when it looks clean . A horse ca n't put its foot on nothing without making a disturbance and neither can a man . Just take a look around now . " I swept my eyes all around in a hurry for fear we 'd been snuck up on , but could n't see nothing but more ribrock and grass and bare patches sloping up a foothill before the serious mountains commenced . " How much rock do you see ? " Tracker says . " Considerable , " I says . " How long do you reckon them slabs and boulders and outcroppers been laying there ? " he says . " Quite a spell , I spose . " " And how often do you spose they get stepped on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'd care to name ? " he says . Since us and our horses was the only ones in sight and it being likely nobody else was going to pass by this way today or even tomorrow or next week , and since they could n't step on every rock even if they did come through , and since bear and deer and mountain sheep kept mostly to their little trails , and since there was n't no grazing nearby , I says , " Most likely once every ten or twenty year . " He nodded like that was n't a bad guess , but says , " Or most likely never . But when it does happen , it 's a commotionto that stone or rock . Takes it a long while to grow its skin back . In the long run , rain helps because rain 's got dust in it . But in the short run , rain helps make everythingeven more clear . Now if you know what to look for , it 's as easy to track across bare rock as across mud or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time cussing . " I followed every word and kept my eye on everything he pointed at and knelt down when he knelt and was having a grand time shoveling all this information into my long tom where I 'd be washing it down for gold for many a year , but then I remembered Lud and Sooger riding off somewhere happy as blackbirds on a new heap of manure and the horse tracks leading down toward the gully and the gold off someplace or other , and here was me and Tracker looking at a slab of rock for the fun of it . It did n't make me feel guilty : the real trouble was he was still wrong . He still had n't caught on to the trick , whatever it was , and I hated to think of Lud and Sooger or anybody tricking him because that meant they could trick me too which I do n't enjoy . So I says , " The horses went that way , south towardp60Crockville , " Crockville , " pointing in case he 'd forgot . " What 're we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the edge where the long slab come up at a low slant out of the hardpan , tilting his head like it was too heavy for him , his eyes squinty , then hunkereddown all of a sudden and took his hat off and fanned hisself with it . " I do n't know what you 're doing , " he says , " but I 'm tracking . " And he left off fanning his face and commenced fanning the slab next to him , comingso close the brim of his stetson almost brushed it . Out of nothing a bootprint showed up , looking to be about half the size of mine , but I got big feet . He pointed up the slab where it turned into boulders and more hardpan and broken ground . " That 's where one went , " he says . " Then who made them other hoofprints ? " I says . " Horses , " he says . " It7s customary . But they was three that knowed their way home without nobody on them . One man come this way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strange kind of pride but had n't capped it off yet , so I says , " What happened to the other two robbers ? " Tracker looked way back downhill east toward Sheepshankwhich we could n't see and says , " I reckon somewherethey found a good hard place to get off and then hunted up something else to ride on . Or had it stashed . " I let out a cackle spite of myself and done a little heelto-toe , making Jigger shy off a ways . " I knew you 'd figure it out , " I says . " Without me even telling you . " " Without telling me what ? " he says , looking worried at me . But I did n't want to let it out about Lud and Sooger and did n't even want to think about them at a time like this ,  |p61so  I says , We got the third one afoot , by God ! Let 's get going . " He shook his head . " Hold your water , " he says . " Somebodywent to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as much trouble catching up , or we might catch the trouble instead of whoever 's making it . " He led his horse up the slab of rock , and I followed . " Nice and easy now , " he says , commencing to fan the tracks now and then with his stetson . We spent two hours travelling about a quarter mile , and what slowed us down was how Tracker kept scouting all around at the ridges hanging above us and going zigzageven when the sign did n't and not looking at the ground more'n half the time but scanning every which way , mostly up ahead . He stopped by the biggest boulder yet  --  twice as tall as us and big enough around as a house  --  and leant on it in the shade and smeared the dust around on his forehead with his red flowery-patterned wipes and says , " Still not too late to go back to stabling , boy . I expect you could find your way . East and south is the same as downhill . " " Nothing back there for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watching him take a slug out of his canteen which smelt like Mr. Bastion 's whiskey , whiles I drank out of mine which smelt like plain crick water . " It 's likely to get more dangerous , " he says , but soundinglike he enjoyed it . " If it 's so dangerous for me , why ai n't it for you ? " I says . " I 'm just a natural-born knothead , " he says . " I had a job once , but come to find out I was one of them peoplep62goes through life looking for a place to set down  --  unless I get my curiosity going . And when I 'm tracking , I get curious . " It seemed like a painful confession , but I says , " I 'm curious all the time , even shaking hay . " " So I notice , " he says , nodding at me like I was a mortal burden to him and me both , but then smiling a little to take the edge off of it . " Curiosity ai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they tell you . But I expect someday you and me 'll find out what it done to the cat . " " What was that ? " I says . He took a deep breath and scouted around some more , pulling his hat brim down to shade his eyes . " Maybe we better ask this here cat we 're following , " he says , getting set to move again . " Where 'd all these boulders come from ? " I says , giving ours a slap in the side like you might an old safe horse . " And what 're they good for ? " All of a sudden he looked madder'n hell and stared straight at me dead serious . " Do n't talk like that , " he says . " They come from inside the mountains or out of the guts of the earth or they fell out of the damned sky , who knows , same as you , where did you come from and what the hell are you good for ? " " That 's what I 'm trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ milky . " Well , try harder , " he says . " What the hell do you think you 're standing on ? " " Dirt ? " I says , it being the easiest guess . " Some people call it that , " he says , coming off the boil a little . " But this here 's Injun country we 're in , and you better pay it some mind . This here 's Arapaho land , and you better do some thinking like them or you wo n't find nothing up here but a bellyful of flint . "  | " Yes , sir , " I says . " But I do n't even know how to think like my own self , let alone them . " He took out his canteen again after he 'd already strapped it back on his horse and put down another slug for emphasis . " You got to pay your respecks to everything , " he says . " Everything . " I was n't sure how he meant it , but I says , " How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardly ever been outside of Sheepshank except for night-riding . And I did n't meet no Injuns . " Since he was looking milder , I added on , " Besides , everybody says you was a better tracker than them even . " " I could show you three Arapahoes within ten mile of here that could trail anything that touches the ground once a day and half the things that do n't , " he says . " You show them a goddamn hoofprint , they 'll tell you the color of the horse and where its grand-daddy 's buried . " " I 'd sure admire to meet them , " I says . He looked me over hard , like he was making sure I meant that , which I did . Then he says , " Well , they 'll make up their own mind about that . Maybe if you stick to this here foolishness , I 'll take you up to Aniqu village and let you see how things is sposed to get done . " " Was you ever an Injun full time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep leathery like that under his shirt too . He started leading his horse away from the boulder , and I followed , and he says , " I been most things and I been most places , but never nothing or nowhere for long . Let that be a sorry lesson to you . " " For instance , how would an Injun do what we 're trying to do ? " I says . We was standing at the mouth of a wide draw full of them boulders , and it seemed to get higher-sided and narrower as it went up , with no way ofp64telling whether it was blind or not , but the sign he kept fanning led that way . " In the first place , he would n't be doing it except for good pay or to count coup but if he did , he would n't go clumping up any draw like this without asking permissionfirst , " he says . " Bound to been a fight here once and people killed , and he 'd know who they was . " " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " I says . " You got something better to do ? " " But I do n't know nobody who got kilt here , " I says , looking around and feeling like I was being spied on by dead Injuns and worried about all the rough corners we could n't see past and wondering if I should take up anotherline of work . " Then try the ha-anake-i , " he says . " Plenty of rocks laying around waiting to be treated proper . " " Am I sposed to pray to rocks ? " I says . " You want to be a good tracker someday ? " " Yes , sir , " I says . " Well , then you might 's well get started , " he says . " Rocks 'll tell you a whole lot more about cutting for sign than them Sunday-Go-to-Hells you probably been listening to . " I had n't done much of that , though Mrs. Clendennon had set me up for it many a time and had considerable to say about blasphemery . " You really want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shuffling along amongst the boulders slower than ever , though I seen a fifty-foot clearing up ahead . " Sure , " he says . " Do I have to get down on my knees ? " " Suit yourself , " he says . So I kept on walking a little behind him so 's he couldn'tp65see the look on my face in case I could n't straighten it all the way out . " Rocks , " I says , " I 'd be much obliged if you 'd let us go up this draw safe and sound and find the third robber and the gold and make me a good tracker . " I left off , hesitating , and says , " Do rocks want an Amen on there ? " " Most of them do n't want nothing in particular , " he says . We come out into the mostly level clearing , and in the middle of it was a crooked stump , bent over and partway burnt but still sound , and Tracker let his reins trail so 's his horse could nibble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here and there , and I done likewise . Then he walked over to the stump , which was about as tall as him , and struck his ear up against it and clapped his hand over his free ear and stood there listening . I did n't know whether this was more Injun doings or what , so I waited , not wanting to listen to the other side of the stump out of respeck in case it happened to be his particular listening post or something , though I did n't know if I was sposed to take my hat off . I waited a couple minutes , getting the lay of the land . A magpie hauled its long tail feathers from one jut of rock to another off south of us , raising a little fuss , but I could n't hear nothing else . When I could n't stand it no longer , I says , " What you listening to ? " But Tracker did n't move a fleck or answer . Now all I could hear was Jigger wheezing behind me and yanking at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afraid he 'd gone loco yet sure he knew something I did n't know , and I do n't know what made me say it , but maybe he 'd got me thinking aboutp66ghosts and sperits right out in plain daylight . " Can trees talk ? " I says , and waited some more and says , " What do you hear ? " He turned halfway on me , looking riled . " You , for the sweet sake of the Boy Jesus ! You ! " he says in a shouting whisper . " Hush up ! " Then he begun acting even stranger : our horses had wandered off a little ways , looking for something to munch at that was n't all burrs , and Tracker took a couple steps toward them , then stopped and glanced back at a good-sized boulder that was even closer , but then went stock still and just stared down at the ground where there was n't no trace of a sign I could notice . I got beside him and looked too , taking my lessons as they come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " What 're we doing ? " " We 're looking at the goddamn ground is what we 're doing , " he says , flat and tense and quiet . So I focused sharp and still did n't see nothing . Giving up , I says , " What do we see ? " " Nothing , but do n't tell nobody , " he says . And I felt a good bit better , since I had n't been making some fool mistake . Then suddenly talking faster , Tracker pointed at the dirt and says , " You see them two small gray stones there , one tipped up sideways and the other flat ? " " Yes , sir , " I says . " You see that groove in that little patch of sand just past them ? " he says . " Yes , sir , " I says , frowning because it did n't look like no kind of sign to me . " Injuns been here ? " " Do n't rush me , " he says , raising his arm out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where I 'm point-ing ? "  | " Yes , sir , " I says , but there was n't nothing there but down-slope haze and heat shimmer . " What am I doing with my eyes ? " he says . I ducked a little to see under his hat brim and says , " You 're looking someplace else . " " Now what am I doing ? " he says . I got back a step to give him room and begun to feel awful uneasy about him , but I played along and says , " You 're pointing north and looking east . " Without turning his eyes my way , he says , " What do you figure is going on , boy ? " " Well , it beats me to the dinner table , " I says . " You want to know what I learnt while I was examiningthis chunk of God 's third-day leftovers ? " he says . " Yes , sir . " " I learnt we need a bath , and I learnt there 's somebody up near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left of  --  damn you , do n't look , " he says , catching me turning my head to locate what he was talking about . " No , sir , " I says , freezing up. "  --  keeping a close eye on us and trying to figure out do we know something he do n't . " I strained my eyes so far into the corners , I could n't see nothing but brows and lashes , yet still could n't see the right place . " Do we ? " I says . Without no warning Tracker commenced running for the nearest boulder but could n't go faster'n a trot , so I kept up pretty good , saying , " What 's going on ? " " Do n't talk , " he says . " Run . " " Where we going ? " I says . " Cover , " he says . " What kind ? " I says . " You 're about to get shot at , you idjit , " he says , sprawlingflat next to the dished-in side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that hanging valley for sure when there come a sharp , loud cough and a whanging ricochet off of the rock next to me . I could n't see no smoke nor place the sound which seemed to come from both sides of the wash and overhead and behind and before all at once . " How do you tell which way a shot 's coming from ? " I says . " Keep standing there and you can line it up between your eyes , " Tracker says . " Get down , you calf-brained slewfoot ! " " Well , why did n't you say so , " I says , getting down on all fours about the time another bullet chipped off a piece of rock alongside of my head . Our horses was milling around on the other edge of the clearing , not liking the noise any but not going far because we 'd trailed our reins . Another shot kicked up a puff of gritty dust a foot away from where I was bracing myself with my left hand , and I took a good look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd remember one next time . " It do n't look much like a footprint , does it , " I says . " It do n't feel like one neither , " Tracker says , and he give a shrill whistle that like to put my ear out , but his horse only pricked its ears and held still a second and did n't come . " Ah , hell , maybe it 's just as good this way . If he shoots my horse , I 'll have to go kill him for it , and I might hurt myself . " " What 's he shooting at us for ? " I says . Tracker give me a disgusted look . " Well , it just might be thirty thousand dollars , " he says . " You think he 's got the gold with him ? " I says . While he checked the chambers of his sixgun , still laying flat , Tracker says , " Eli , how many people youp69know of wears a size six shoe , stands about five foot five , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " None , " I says . " Me neither , " he says . " Then chances are the gold 's up in that little hanging valley right now . With a carbine propped on it , aimed at us . " " Well , why do n't we tell him we do n't want his dang gold ? " I says . " Why do n't we tell him we 're just practicing up tracking ? " " Go on up and tell him , " Tracker says , clicking his gun shut and looking at it on both sides like it was a piece of trash he 'd picked up someplace and did n't know whether to keep it or throw it back . " This wo n't be no more use than a tack-hammer if he stays out in rifle-range and circles , which is what I 'd do if I was him . " " Well , if I was him , I 'd quit shooting at folks and go think up something better to do , " I says . " In that case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Tracker says . Meanwhile , having the time to pass for a change , I got out my harmonica and blew a couple notes , keeping an eye on Tracker so 's not to give offense , but he seemed too busy peeking out up the draw to notice . I played a little " Buffalo Gals , " which was another one on the Mercury 's player-piano and which I 'd only partly got the hang of , but it seemed too lively to suit , so I switched over to " Old MacDonald " as usual which I can at least get past the first verse of . But Tracker says , " Keep an eye peeled that side comingdown along the rim closer to flank us , and you see anything that do n't look like rock or gravel , let out a yip . And keep your nose low and pulled in . " Which is hard to do if you want to see around the edgep70of a rock , but I tried , bracing myself about a foot off of the ground and gradually slipping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I was just about to get my left eye sharpened on the raggedy rim-line that stretched above and past us , when the tight cough and whang come again and my mouth-harp busted to smithers in my left hand . I 'd always wanted to know what the inside of one looked like , but I had n't figured on finding out like this . I let out half a howl and commenced scooping up the pieces  --  little slivers of wood and a twisted chunk of tin and what looked like a comb with brass teeth  --  but right in the midst of it , Tracker come rolling over at me and yanked me backwards , jabbering , and the noise went cough-whang again , and he got shot in the left forearm about four inches below the elbow . He laid there in the shade and shelter having swearing practice while I helped him tie his red wipes around it to stanch the blood . " Least it 's dark blood , " he says , rubbing some between his fingers . " So it 's coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pinching up his lips and nose all together and letting that bank robber have blue hell and me a dose of the same for not having more sense than go junk-collecting under fire . " I 'm sorry , sir , " I says , stowing the pieces of mouthharpaway so 's he 'd forget about them . He kept clinching his fingers and letting go and twistinghis elbow a little , then says , " I do n't think it broke nothing . " " Would you like me to take your gun and go get your horse  --  mine ca n't climb good enough or I 'd use my own  --  and take after that gent and take him into  --  " I was going to say custody but did n't want to get asked where it was at "  --  and bring him back here ? "  |p71He  looked at me dead still for a few seconds , then says , " What I 'd like you to do is  --  " he stopped to think it over . " I 'd like you to  --  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then shoved it down tight against the dirt and listenedhard . " He 's riding . Fast . Just one . The other way . " Tracker struggled to his knees , and I helped him up , but he had to bend over his arm for a while and squeeze on it before he could walk . We better get going while we can . He had another horse stashed up there . " We moved out in the clear , slow and wary at first , but no more shots come at us , and when we was mounted up , I says , " Can you make it to Crockville by yourself ? They must have a doe . I could get up on the ridge and find his trail and see if I could follow him like you showed me and maybe he 'll dump off the gold someplace , and I could  --  " But Tracker was already moving off downhill and turningsouth , and he says , " Come on , forget that kind of talk , boy . I just been shot for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want you to get started on that too early . Being bushwhacked once a day 's plenty . Do n't go striking for more . Besides , I need some whiskey to scare this lead out of me , and I do n't want to faint someplace along the way . I need you to ride herd on me . " I helped him get the cap off of his near-dry canteen and watched while he chattered down what was left , and then we moved out . " Well , everybody else is heading for Crockville , " I says . " Must be something nice about it . " He did n't say nothing but just kept his horse walking , meanwhile twisting his head all around now and then like he had a stiff neck , but I could n't tell whether he was in pain or figuring out some new way to cut for sign , high and low.  |p72As  LONG AS WE WAS GOING DOWNHILL , Jigger didn'thave no trouble trotting along as fast as Tracker 's black gelding , Spud , which was n't exactly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level late in the afternoon , Jigger begun to hold up and take her time and fall back and was n't nothing I could do about it . " Ca n't you get that pecker neck to move ? " Tracker says , his temper being on the warm side , what with the pain and running dry on whiskey and afraid maybe he 'd look a fool for getting ambushed . I did n't want to spur Jigger with her still coughing once in a while , so I says , " I ca n't risk having her lay down on me . " " A sow can go faster than that , " he says . " What 're you doing riding a sick horse anyways ? " Instead of pointing out his horse 's bog spavin and what looked to be windpuffs above the near hind fetlock , I says ,  | " I 'll try riding a sow if you 'd like to round one up for me , and I did n't have no choice of mounts , sir , and how does it feel to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so 's he 'd have something else to talk about for a half mile , figuring if he stayed mad , he would n't faint . He slowed down till we was riding side by side , and he looked me over close with sweat dripping down off of his chin . " It feels like a kick in the crutch , boy , if you really want to know , " he says . " Only , all over . And may I remind you that bullet was aimed at a goddamn fool did n't know no better than crawl out in the open with a gunsightsquare on his head which I come to believe is full of last year 's lard if anything . " But I did n't take no offense . " I 'm sorry , sir , " I says . " I guess I just was n't scairt enough . " " You 're too dumb to be scairt , " he says . " It takes brains to be scairt . " But he could n't say nothing much to me that Mr. Clendennon and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since I could tell what people was yelling at me . " Then I reckon I 'll just die young , " I says , smiling at him to cheer things up a bit . " Saves trouble . " He puzzled over me half a minute and took a couple extra breaths , then seemed to give up on arguing and just looked down at the sign them three horses had left , as familiar now as any marks could be . We 'd run into them again when we 'd backtracked and shortcutted , aiming for Crockville . " At least they 're walking too , " Tracker says . " Nobody on their back and probably nothing in their belly . " As long as he 'd turned mild , I figured I could ask an embarrassing question . " Sir , if you should happen to pass out by accident , what would you like me to do first ? "  | " You just keep that nanny goat moving and do n't worry about me , " he says . " I 'm too goddamn thirsty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going , me feeling shamed but bound I 'd do better if I happened to get a next time at it . After a couple more miles the tracks turned onto a road and begun to get mixed up with others , which did n't bother Tracker none but made me start blurring up : Ili there 'd been wagon wheels of four or five different sizes and a couple people afoot and half a dozen other horses . And when he seen me scowling and blinking , Tracker turned up a half-smile for the first time since he 'd been shot . " It 's just like listening to somebody in a crowd , " he says . You pick out the voice you want and just skip over the rest . Takes a little practice . " He had n't fell off yet , but there 'd been a time or two he 'd looked like he 'd just as soon . Then , when we was going through a stretch of sagebrush and across a dry crick bed , what looked like it had been a herd of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and though they 'd already reached town or gone past it , they 'd left nothing but these little scuffy deep-toed tracks all over the other sign . Tracker took one look and says , " Course , sometimes the crowd starts shouting and you ca n't hear yourself think . " Crockville looked bigger than I 'd reckoned on , twice as big as Sheepshank , with two general stores and two saloonsand a two-story bank and two kind of church ( least they had crosses up top ) and four or five extra streets and even some trees and a real post office with a sign on it ,  |p75not  just a couple barrels with a plank across in the corner of the stage station , and a hotel with ten windows , and I 'd of been impressed and maybe confused if I had n't been so worried . " Know how to find a doctor ? " I says . " I can ask some-body . " " You mind yourself , boy , " he says , dismounting in front of the Wagon Tongue Saloon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shook off my hand . " See if you can smell out some hay and water for these thoroughbreds here . You got any money ? " " I got eleven cents , " I says . " But what about your arm ? " " I know a bar-dog in here 'll do it cheaper and pass out free nose-paint to boot , " he says , looking almost cheerful . He scrabbled around in his pants pocket and come out with a greasy-looking silver dollar and handed it over like he was glad to lighten his load . " And get something to eat over at Fanny 's while you 're at it . You must be gutshrunkafter that jerky and beans . " But I did n't want to take it . " Maybe I can find a livery stable and do chores for it , " I says . " Take it ! " he says , looking riled and dizzy both . " I got another one . " So I took it , but says , " I ca n't pay you back yet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , " Tracker says , going through the swinging door , good side first . I led Jigger and Spud across the road , worried but not knowing what else to do , half-scairt of getting lost in a fresh town this size , and there was a hardware store next to Fanny 's selling all kind of horse-tack in the window  --  mane combs and dandy brushes and hackamores andp76hobbles and pommel pads and such  --  and I figured they 'd know where I could scout me up some hay . And I decided right then and there I was n't going to keep practicing up for my funeral , which I intended to postpone a good fifty years , nor pulling long faces nor trying to play mother hen to an old man that did n't want nothing of the kind . I might not of been a tracker yet , but I was sure nosey and that 's a good start . So I threw all the sheep tracks out of my head till it looked smooth and clear as far as my mind 's eye could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hardware store , set to start all over . The clerk had been snuggled up to a lady customer on her side of the counter , but she broke away and commencedresticking her hatpins , and the clerk shoved his sleeve-garters up higher and located his toothpick where he 'd left it next to the hinge on the counter flap and frowned at me like I had n't no business bringing him some business . They was n't selling no feed that I could see , but there was some standing-at-stud notices tacked up on a post which I glanced over while the young lady got herself straightened up for company . " What can I do you out of , kid ? " the clerk says . And the question come right out of my mouth like there had n't been another thought in there . " What kind of harmonicas you got ? " I says . " Finest , sweetest mouth-harps in the world , " the clerk says , showing off for the lady . " Sometimes when I come to work in the morning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theirselves . " I give the stud notices a quick check-through , then come over to the counter . " Mind if I look ? " I says.  | " No harm in looking , " he says , sounding fool-cheery and talking more at the lady than me . But look out : once you see it , you ca n't do without it . You ca n't live without it . She turned off , blushing , and give a peach-peeler a couple of cranks , and I says , " Do n't I know it . " I hauled out the remainders of my mouth-harp and laid them on the counter . " Take a look at that . " " What is it ? " he says , brushing some of the hair out of his eyes and bending down . " That 's my Gebruder Ludwig-Richter Prairie Queen Harmonica that got shot , " I says . " Well , it 's shot all right , " he says . " I reckon I need a new one , " I says . " I hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boxes out of a drawer and laid them down in front of me like they was bird 's eggs and opened their lids my way . " That 's our finest Hohner Grand Auditorium Mouth Harp , " he says , touching the smaller left-hand one . " Sixteenholes , nickel-plated , guaranteed to raise goosebumpson the tenderest flesh or the most callused heart . " He looked off at the lady to see how he was doing . But I could hardly take my eye off them two beautiful visions laying in front of me , all shiny and new and jammed full of music . He shoved the right-hand one forward a half-inch . And this is our Viennese Brunnbauer Concert Mouth Harp with fancy animal covers , the most powerful instrument of its size , " he says . As many holes as people got pearly teeth to smile with . " And he tried out his own smile on the lady . But I did n't have no time to see was she giving him one back . I felt like I was sposed to feel in church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organ busted and commenced shooting dust on Mrs. Clendennon'scrinoline skirt . I had never dreamt there was a mouth-harp like the second one . " How much ? " I says , having to talk around my adam 's apple which had come halfway up for a visit . " Fifty-five cents for the one , and a dollar twenty-five for the other , " he says . I rearranged the chunks of the busted one so the bent parts was mostly underneath . " I do n't reckon you 'd trade me in nothing , " I says . He give a quiet , shy smile like he was going to pretend he had n't heard nothing that foolish spoke out loud . I did n't mind leaving my own stomach empty , but I could n't let Jigger and Spud go hungry for a mouth-harp , and besides , I did n't have but $1.11 anyway , and oh , God , why had n't I clumb around on Mr. Clendennon 's roof before him ? But all the while my mind was jumbling with money , there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Can you direct me to the livery stable , please ? Do you know how much their hay fetches these days ? " He started to point and answer , but my spring felt all wound up , and I kept right on going . " I see there 's a Miz Cherry Bastion with two stallions at stud . Is that the gold-mine Bastions ? I thought they lived over on a ranch near Sheepshank . " " Who the hell are you when you 're at home ? " the clerk says . " I 'm the man that 's going to buy one of them harmonicasfrom you before you close up , " I says . " What 've you got to do with the Bastions ? " he says . In a whiny , pinch-nosed voice the lady says , " Mrs. Bastionand Miz Cherry do n't like those crude outdoor placesp79like a ranch . They like living in town where they can show off . " " I would n't mind standing at stud for Cherry Bastion myself , " the clerk says , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You go right ahead and do that , " she says , starting for the front door , but not so fast the clerk could n't catch up and hold on . " Well , I been doing a little work for Mr. Bastion up in the mountains , " I says . " But I thought he lived over in  --  " " He does , " the clerk says . " This is just where he stables his womenfolk . " He fell to whispering at the lady , but she kept scowling at him and then scowling at me , and finally to get shut of me he says , " Biggest house in town . North up the alley past the oak tree . " I figured I 'd been told all I was likely to hear , so I left them to their business and hurried out and led Jigger and Spud around back and along the alley amongst the mashed-in tomato cans and bottlenecks ( which is the hardest part of a bottle to bust unless you work at it like Tracker done back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and green acorns , and there was two houses  --  one bigger'nthe other  --  with stables and kitchen gardens , twostorywhite frame houses with four chimbleys apiece and the big one with a side drive that had white pillars and a roof over it , the like of which I never seen before . Between the stables two men  --  one my age and the other maybe fifty  --  was stripped to the waist and choppingkindling and disenjoying theirselves at it to judge by the look on their face . Between the stables and the houses was a pair of full-up horse troughs , each with its own pump , and hay sticking out of doors , and it looked so good I had a mind to eat and drink it myself . When I stopped to watch , they both kept glancing atp80me but did n't say nothing right off . They went on whappingaway at a heap of two-foot split quarters of pine which they had n't done half of yet and sweating and going at it hit-and-miss . The older one took a swing at a chunk he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pieces flying end over end so 's they both had to duck , and the younger one turned on me like it was my fault and says , " What do you want ? " " Either of these places got any chores they want did ? " I says . " Nothing for you , " he says . " Do you happen to know what they 're asking for hay and oats at the livery stable ? " I says . " These have n't had nothing worth mentioning for a day and a half . " " Forkful of hay and a can of oats : two bits , " the older one says , leaning on his ax handle like he 'd just as leave not pick it up again for a spell . And that 's what I 'd been scairt of : the price was the same as Mr. Clendennon , and that meant I 'd only have 61  --  left over and could n't buy nothing but the Hohner Grand Auditorium Mouth Harp even if I went without dinner , and I 'd have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somebody else probably bought it anyway . So I took a deep breath ( not being of a business mind ) and says , " If you 'll feed and water my two horses  --  and I see enough hay strowed around the yard there going to waste to feed one  --  and give me fourteen cents to boot , I 'll chop the rest of that kindling for you and do any other chores you got to spare . " They both stood there thinking it over , and I seen the older one glance back at the sun which was commencing to lower and turn red , and the younger one snuck a look at the backs of the houses to see was anyone looking.  |p81Then  they looked at each other , still not talking . Finally the older one says , " I 'd just as soon be out on a dirt farm as doing this , " sounding disgusted . But the younger one stared at me and says , " Who 're you ? " " I 'm Eli from over in Sheepshank , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what there is of it . " " Least we do n't let no banks get blowed up around here , " the young one says . The older one took a quick swing at another chunk of wood and hit it cockeyed and just missed his foot with the ax blade . " I 'll give him a dime if you 'll give him four cents , " he says . The younger one paused , sucking on his lip , then says , " Well , let 's see if he can do it first . " I 'd always swung a mean ax if I do say so as should n't , and when I took off my shirt and laid into it , they did n't say nothing else but just stood back and left me to the job of making little ones out of big ones ( which was how Mr. Clendennon always tried to joke it ) . After a minute , the older man led Jigger and Spud behind the Bastions ' stable where they could n't be seen from the house and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bucket of water , while the kid scuffed off into the neighbor 's stable like he did n't want to watch his four cents being chopped up , but I did n't pay no attention , being in a mortal hurry to get finished before the hardware store closed up . And I tried to imagine being that clerk with two beautiful harmonicaslaying there in the drawer , just aching to be played on , and he could n't think of nothing better to do than mooning and sniffing around that lady . It did n't make sense to me then , but I come to a better understandingin about forty-five minutes when I met Miz Cherry Bastion.  |p82I  HEARD HER before I seen her , and from fifty foot off , yelling through a screen door , she did n't make too good an impression . It happened like this : I 'd made a pretty fair dent in the heap of pine quarters , and the older man who was called Matt had hunkered down nearby , not so much to watch as pass the time of day telling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other one ) always got stuck with these back-busters when they was both only sposed to be horse grooms , him for the Bastions and Shorty for the Quirts ( who was half as rich and twice as ornery ) and on and on about how he was sposed to be inside right that minute polishing up the Columbus phaeton for some big doings as if I was keeping him from it with all this commotion . And then her voice come zipping out through the yard and passed by on its way to the edge of town and points east and north , and we froze stiff for a second , thinking itp83was aimed at us . It was n't what you could call screeching and it was n't like words neither because there was n't no room left between . But then some broken glass got mixed up in it and another voice for a little while , being quieter and reasonable , before she re-commenced scaring the horses and cleaning the crows out of the oak tree . I 'd listened to plenty of one-sided arguments in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's being said to get the generalidea . " Who 's that in there painting for war ? " I says . Matt sprung to life , picked up the other ax , dug a dime out of his pocket and handed it over . " Here , " he says . " If she comes out , you 're working for Shorty , not me . " And he begun butchering a hunk of pine and acting busy . Shorty started to come out too , but Matt waved him back , and I went to chopping again . " Miz Cherry 's mad at her beau , " Matt says . " I 'd say she was , " I says , listening to another string of ear-punchers from the back of the house . " Which is like saying the rain usually falls down instead of up around here , " Matt says . " He was sposed to do something or other and did n't do it right . That 's how she gets . " I set up another quarter of pine . " She sounds real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the word for it , " Matt says . " She 's a genuine bangtail . " I hit that chunk of wood , and the back porch door slammed right after like an echo , and there she come down the steps wearing a high-necked , puffy-sleeved , pale-blue shirtwaist and a buckskin riding skirt and planted herself in the yard , snapping looks hither and yonder , sometimes at us , like she 'd just been took off the stove and had to settle down . Her hair was yellowish-red like a light sorrel that 's just been renched off and rubbed ,  |p84and  she either had paint on her face or was still flushed up . She was carrying a short braided riding crop and swatting herself in the leg with it like she wanted to hit something but did n't have nothing else within reach . I 'm not too good at saying what girls look like , but I 'd been working hard at learning how to use my eyes , and they sure come in handy right then . I 've heard people and places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what she was : I gawped so hard , they begun to hurt me . She was middle-sized and straight-backed and slim-faced , and I ca n't begin to tell you what Nature had went and done between her throat latch and her gaskins . I said before , I had give up tomcatting in Sheepshank , but it was mainly because I did n't have no inspiration . Why go to all the trouble to take a bath and change your shirt if all you 're going to see when you 're all dressed up like a sore toe is the likes of Alma Spiggett or Bess Murphry picking their ear with a piece of slate chalk or scratching their impetigo ? But what the mere sight of Miz Cherry Bastion done to me ( and no doubt other innocent bystanders too ) was a caution . She made me feel naked from about forty foot off which I was anyway far as the waist . She took a couple steps toward us , seemed to stare some more , then says , " You ! " Matt give a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Who , me ? " he says . " I was just chopping the  --  " " No , you , " she says . And there was n't nobody left but me because Shorty had ducked back into the neighbor 's stable and she could n't see Jigger and Spud who was n't eligible anyway . " Yes , ma'am ? " I says , feeling like it was the riskiest thing I ever said.  | " Come here , " she says . I left go of the ax and took my shirt along , not knowing whether it 'd be rude to skin into it in front of her but needing it sort of for protection , and I crossed the yard like I was on a split plank over a crick , and I says , " Yes , ma'am ? " again , since I 'd already practiced that one . " Are you working for the Quirts ? " she says , quick , clear , and snappy but full of power and more-to-come like circus music just warming up . I heard Matt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to save us both lying . " In a manner of speaking , ma'am , " I says . Then she glanced over her shoulder at the streaky kitchen window and says , " What 's your name ? " like she was talking as much to somebody in there as to me . She was near enough to touch ( though I could n't of done it even if I 'd been so bold , since I felt like I 'd left my hands someplace else ) , and she was upwind of me , thank God , because I not only got the benefit of her scent , which I wo n't bother to try describing since there ai n't no such words , but it kept me from giving her a noseful of what I 'd managed to round up in the way of smells that week . " Eli , " I says . " Eli what ? " she says . And there I was again . " Well , Clendennon , I guess , " I says . " Do n't you know your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the words come out a little sharp and school-teacherish , but I heard a whole wild and woolly , lavender-sachet and cambric-andlaceworld laying behind it , and it like to turn my head inside out . I begun to stammer , and she says , " How old are you ? " " Well , far as I know , I 'm  --  "  | " I expect you 're too young , " she says . " You look like you ought to be turned loose and thrown back . " " I ai n't too young to get my hopes up , " I says , amazed by me being able to talk out loud at all , let alone like that . " I already been turned loose , but nobody 's throwed me back yet . " She hesitated , like she was testing what I said for how much sass was in it , then started tal ing again , aiming most of it at the porch door . " Wou d you like to be my escort at a dance tonight ? " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meant if it was something to do with her . " That 'd be a great honor , ma'am , " I sa s . " Can you drive a phaeton all right ? " she says . " I can drive anything on wheels and ride anything on legs , " I says , not letting my modesty be a hinder to me at a time like this when I meant to make an impression if I died trying , which all of a sudden seemed like a pretty fair possibility because through the lace curtain of one of the kitchen windows I seen Sooger Worley staring at me probably thinking the slanty sunlight hid him good enough . But I did n't let on . " And you do n't happen to be too busy to show up on time ? " she says , aiming it over her shoulder again . " No , ma'am , " I says . " And quit calling me ma'am , " she says . I did n't have no idea how old she was , but she was older than me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's what I was taught how to call a lady , " I says . " Call me Miss Cherry , " she says . " Matt , did you polish that phaeton yet ? " " Uh  --  mostly , " he says . " I want it shiny and I want it up under the portecochereat eight o'clock sharp and him in it , hear ? "  | " Yes , Miz Cherry . " Then she give me a long , lingery look all the way up and down , including my shirt which had sort of trailed back in the dust by then , with her hazel eyes testy and restless and calculating like I seen many a man do when he was trying to best Mr. Clendennon over a horse ( which was a mighty poor way to improve yourself ) , even the ones that could n't tell a calf-kneed horse from one that was camped out . So it did n't necessarily mean she was smart , but I was n't thinking like that anyway : I did n't have her brains no more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , wicked and happy and full of ginger , and spun around and stomped up the porch and let the spring door slam after her . I started back towards the kindling , feeling weak in the shanks , and Matt says , " Goddamn it , " I guess meaningthings in general . " She likes people to hop to it , do n't she , " I says . " She do n't know what she likes , " Matt says . And whiles I was crossing a muddy place by the horsetroughs , I looked down out of force of my newest habit , namely reading hoofprints , and there amongst the layers of overlapping sign was one I knew by heart : it was the off forefoot of the boot-shoed member of that trio I 'd been looking at , with Tracker 's help , for most of two days . I knelt and touched it , but in that kind of ground it was too clear to miss , even showing the sand crack on the inside buttress that I had n't seen but three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was mostly too hard or too dusty . Shorty come out of the other stable and says , " Did I hear that straight ? " He looked like he was having trouble holding his mouth shut , and maybe I was too . I pulled myself to/gether and spent three minutes polishing off the last of the pine quarters and got my shirt on and says , " Four cents , please . " " You did n't stack it yet , " Shorty says . " I did n't say nothing about stacking , " I says , keeping my hand out and getting my hat on and feeling full of contrary ideas . He grudged out the pennies one at a time , I think mostly because I was about a foot taller than him and Matt was watch'ng , and whiles I untied Jigger and Spud , I says , " What kind of dancing do they do at them dances ? " " Do n't you know how to dance , boy ? " Shorty says , sounding hopeful . But I could tell I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have no time to soak it up from anybody now , so I trotted off down the alley toward the hardware store , wondering what I 'd do for brains if it was shut and I could n't get me that mouth-harp to help me think because I was going to have to figure out some way to ask Tracker if he 'd mind me going dancing with the beautiful young lady that had shot him.  |p89THE  CLERK was just pulling down the CLOSED shade inside the front window , but I beat him to the door before he could latch it . " We 're closed , kid , " he says . But I 'd squoze by him by then , aiming for the counter and getting my money out and not taking No for an answer , since I did n't want to wait till morning because there might not even be a morning the way things was going . He followed me with his hair mussed and his bowtie gone and the lady probably waiting for him back of a curtain that looked like it 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wished him well at it but felt too much in a hurry to pry . I laid out Tracker 's silver dollar and Mr. Lathrop 's dime and penny and Matt 's dime and Shorty 's four cents worth , and I says , " I want that Viennese Brunnbauer Concert Mouth Harp , please . " He took a look at the curtain , then seemed to decide it 'd be more trouble to throw me out than sell me something ( and it would of ) , so he went behind the counter , slid the drawer out , scooped up my entire estate , and handed me the box which I checked over , hefted , and sneaked a look into to be sure it was the right one . Then I let him hustle me out onto the boardwalk and slam the door after . The best time to own something is before you can believe it 's yourn . I inspected that box all over and read the fancy print and admired the cardboard hinge in the back and smelt it , then looked for a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way . Crockville was commencing to stir around a little betwixt afternoon and evening , though the hogs had n't got up yet out of the mud they 'd been laying in alongside the road , and I did n't see no sign of Tracker across the way , so he was probably still getting hisself fixed up . Traps and surreys and marketwagons went plodding and squeaking by in both directions , and the dogs had come out of the afternoon shade to see what was new , including me , and I got settled on the edge of the boardwalk with my shoulder up against a hitching-post . And then I lifted that lid back . Who 'd want to bother eating when he could hold in his own two hands a 32-hole harmonica with two horses and some green grass hand-painted on each nickel-plated cover , a black and a buckskin facing each other and neighing ( their mane and tail both needed a good combing , and they was both too long in the barrel , but the artist had to get them on there the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I raised it up and blew what they call middle-C , just by itself , which you got to stick your tongue out partway for , and it near made me cry ( which I 'd left off doing five years previous when Alma Spiggett caught me doing it after arithmetic and worked me into a jump-rope song that went " Eli , Eli , cry-baby , run . Six times three don'tp91make twenty-one . " ) . And then I just set there a while , hearing the note in my head and admiring whoever 'd thought up how to make one of these things . How did those boys over in Vienna  --  which is mountain country too , they say  --  think up the idea in the first place ? I can imagine somebody dreaming about making music come out of a little box you can almost hide in your hands , but I ca n't imagine somebody putting it together . It seemed like a fearful wonder that all 's you had to do to make some kind of music was just breathe  --  in or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hard or soft , it did n't matter but for how loud you felt like being or how sweet and far off . I blew a few more notes here and there ( I like that part too because you ca n't make no mistakes yet , and there 's no such a thing as a bum note ) , and by then I had most things figured out about Miz Cherry Bastion except why . There was n't no why 's or whereas 's about Lud and Sooger , just her . And maybe Mr. Bastion . So I started ripping out the first patch of " Buffalo Gals " just to try and get some more blood pumped into my head , messing up the notes the least I 'd ever done and feeling the song buzz me in the ears and take over my whole body till I had to stand up and stomp on it a little , doing a dance I 'd made up myself a year back , up in my hayloft when it was too snowy to ride out . It did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I was n't even missing too many notes , spite of the jouncing I give the boardwalk . A couple little kids commenced laughing at me , but I pretended like they was just enjoying theirselvesso 's I could go on doing likewise . And then , just as I was giving my special little twisty backwards kick ( which I 'd learnt in many a horse stall ) , leaning one hand up against the store-front and playing my mouth/harp one-handed , I felt my heel catch and heard somethingrip and almost tripped myself butt over bucket . I landed safe , but the man standing behind me was big and red-faced and unhappy-looking and had a tin star on his shirt and was rubbing at . a place on his thigh where his dressy , cream-colored pants had got smudged and ripped a little . There was more of him , all the way around , than Sheriff Spitzer even , and the kids all shut up to hear what kind of fun was going to happen now . " I kindly beg your pardon , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He took his time inspecting me and then inspecting his pants . " Practicing what ? " he says . I 'd already stuck my harmonica in my shirt pocket , first thing , not wanting to have it confiscated the way people done over the years with my slingshot , my **29;1942;TOOLONG glass , my willow whistle , my two-blade pocket knife , the first half of a copy of Bertha M. Clay 's Only One Sin that I found tore off behind the hotel but never found the other half of which must of had the sin in it , and other belongings ( including a young snow snake ) they could n't stand me having . I says , " Well , I 'm going to a dance tonight , and I thought  --  " " I do n't know you , " he says , like that had been a serious mistake on my part not to come calling sooner , and he give me another look-over . " I 'm Eli from the livery stable over at Sheepshank , " I says . " Sheepshank ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his mouth . " Sheepshank ? " he says , seeming to enjoy the secondmouthful a little more . " We had to kill a couple of boys from over there yesterday . " " Who was they ? " I says , that question having been nagging at me because it could n't of been the right ones.  | " Why , what 's that to you ? " he says , shooing the kids off a ways where they stood gawping out of kicking range . " I thought maybe I might know who they was , " I says . He fingered the ripped place . " How would a kid like you happen to know bank robbers ? " he says , slow and heavy . " Well , we been tracking them up in the mountains , only one of them shot Tracker Byrd in the  --  " " Who ? " he says , like he might of heard the name before . " Me and Tracker Byrd , " I says . He was scowling and squinting and moving in too close and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a saddle pad coming . " What would you say you was doing around here , boy ? " he says kind of sour . " Nothing much , " I says , looking over at the Wagon Tongue Saloon and wishing Tracker 'd come . " Nothing much , " he says like he was memorizing it . " That sounds like a fair description . " " I 'm just waiting , " I says . Coming too close again and making me turn my shoulder to clear the way , he says , " But what was you aiming to do around here after you was through waiting is what I 'd like to know . You do n't want the sand packing up on the windy side of you , do you ? " " No , sir , " I says , it being the only thing I could think up . " Son , you are too big and too dumb and too damn smart to last long around here , so why do n't you just commence picking up them big feet and laying them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ register on the naked eye no more , " he says . " And then you can tell the boys back home you kicked Sheriff Arthur Bledsoe in his new pantsp94and ripped them and did n't even get kilt while you was at it . I seen Tracker coming out of the saloon with a couple of old-timers holding him up on each side , and I says , " How can I be too dumb and too smart both ? " He leant in close again . " Well , if you was smart enough for this town , you 'd know how to act dumb enough to keep from getting in trouble , but you ai n't , you do n't , and you will , " he says . " So get moving . " The old-timers made Tracker set down on the edge of the other boardwalk , and he did n't look like he was feelingtoo good . " In that case , would you mind telling Miz Cherry Bastion I ca n't be her excort to the dance tonight ? " I says . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " You watch your mouth , boy , " he says . " Where 'd the likes of you meet Miz Cherry ? " I backed off a few steps , acting respectful , and unhitchedJigger and Spud and begun crossing the road with them . " You just tell her for me , " I says . " I would n't want her to get all fussed and worried and cross . " " Now wait a minute , " he says , following me and soundinglike maybe he 'd been around her angry side before . " Let 's go have a little talk with her . " " I just now had a little talk with her , " I says . " I do n't want to wear out my welcome . You tell her you told me to head north . " " Wait , " he says in the middle of the road . But by that time I 'd got the horses hitched in front of the saloon and could see Tracker was feeling poorly . His face was dappled gray , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together . " Did the barkeep get the bullet out all right ? " I says . " Yes , " he says between his teeth.  | " Let 's us take a little walk over to the Bastions ' , " SheriffBledsoe says . " I do n't like being lied to . " He 'd come up behind , and he was giving Tracker a full-length lookover . " Are you Tracker Byrd ? " " That 's right , " Tracker says . He had his arms crossed , and through the bloody tear in his shirtsleeve I seen what looked like a thick piece of sheet wrapped around . " Well , you do n't exactly look like hell with the hide off to me , " Sheriff Bledsoe says . Tracker give him an impatient glance . " Deliver all goods in the rear , " he says . Sheriff Bledsoe blinked a couple times and squinted like he was sighting along what Tracker 'd said like a pool cue , trying to figure out if it was straight or not . And then in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of whiskey poured over it , Sheriff Spitzer with his hat on crooked and his badge off says , " You hot on the trail , old wet-nose ? " He was about ten yards off , spraddling along the boardwalk toward us , with Sam Pollardbehind him , looking sober and scairt . He was talking to Tracker , but Tracker hardly looked up , only bent down further over his crossed arms , aiming his chin at his knees . " I 'm on something all right , but it ai n't hot , " Tracker says . Spitzer stopped dead then and spread his arms and got a big amazed look on his face , drinking in the sight of Sheriff Bledsoe . " And he 's got the short arm of the law with him , by God , " he says . " Come to throw all us Sheepshankboys in jail for getting roostered ? " Acting dignified for a change , which was n't too hard considering the competition , Sheriff Bledsoe says , " I 'm glad to see you took your badge off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told you , and there wo n't be no trouble . "  |p96Still  using his loud voice , Spitzer says , " What I want to know is , what does gold smell like ? " He come closer and leant over Tracker who was setting crouched . " What does it smell like , Tracker ? " " Like any other dirt , " Tracker says . " Ca n't you smell it around here ? " Spitzer says , making some of the chickens move off further down the street and bringing more kids arunning for the show . The doorway of the Wagon Tongue was chockful of men ready to duck for cover any minute , and Sam had backed off , looking scairter yet . " Do n't Crockville smell just like the gold of Cherry Mine ? " Sheriff Bledsoe come up on the boardwalk looking as broad as tall , and he says , " You get yourself roostered , Spitzer , you 'll have to go where the rest of the roosters go at night . You 're no sheriff here . " Turning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seat of his pants and half-yells over his shoulder , " I 'm wearing my badge where it belongs ' cause the only time I can enforce the law is when I 'm looking the other way . " He 'd held his voice down some this time , but Sheriff Bledsoe did n't seem to like it no better . " We already got two corpuses from Sheepshank all set to put to bed with a shovel , " he says . " And we do n't need no more at the mo-ment . " I seen a young man about two doors down holding a carbine aimed at the boardwalk and wearing a badge , and things was n't looking too promising , so I says , " Come on , Tracker , let 's go . " But Sheriff Bledsoe bent down and put his hand under Tracker 's chin and tilted it up . " Listen , breed , " he says . " We do n't like no drunk breeds around here packingp97guns . You just go track yourself north , and do n't let me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Tracker stood up so fast he almost hit Sheriff Bledsoe on the way up , then stepped back a ways while his face turned coppery-colored again . " I ai n't drunk , " Tracker says . " I wish Sheepshank would export something besides jugheads , " Sheriff Bledsoe says , and the boys in the Wagon Tongue doorway got a cackle out of it . " Well , it beats dynamite and a crock of bullshit like you , " Tracker says , which did n't seem likely to soothe things down none . Rising his voice in a snappy kind of bellow , Sheriff Bledsoe says , " Cash ! " He waited till the young man stepped out in full view with his carbine ready , then says , " Let 's us take Mr. Spitzer and Mr. Byrd down to the clink for a good night 's sleep and some free coffee . " Spitzer took a big look backwards and forwards and says , " I 'm wearing a badge . " " Cash ! " Sheriff Bledsoe says , making a go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forth from Tracker to Spitzer . " Start walking , gents . I 'm just saving you from worse trouble . The way you been messing and mouthing , I 'm scairt some of our good citizens might get up a midnightparty for you . " With his hand set to draw , Spitzer says , " I had n't planned on doing any hog-butchering here , but I 'd be glad to . " Sheriff Bledsoe walked up to him almost nose to nose . " Think I 'm afraid of a grunt like you ? " he says . " I 'll put that little parlor gun right up there with your badge . " And he took Spitzer 's sixgun right out of his holster for him , a thing I would n't of tried to do if Spitzer 'd been offp98eating dinner someplace and his gunbelt hanging here on a hook , let alone standing right there , even with a carbinein back of him . " Take him in slow , " Sheriff Bledsoe says to Cash , then turned to look at Sam Pollard who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a while . " Who 're you ? " he says . " Sam Pollard , " Sam says , like he remembered just in time . Sheriff Bledsoe give him a tap in the shirt with his forefinger . You go out and sleep on the prairie someplacebetween here and Sheepshank , " he says . " Amongst the good old prickly pear . " " Yes , sir , " Sam says , starting across the road . I touched Tracker on the good elbow and says , " Come on , let 's go . " " Get away from my gun hand , " he says . Deputy Cash had got Spitzer turned around and walking , and Sheriff Bledsoe come toward us , giving all the loose boards a work-out . " You 're going to follow right along , breed , " he says . " Injun file . " " No , sir , I do n't believe I will , " Tracker says . " I 'm too sober to do a fool thing like that . " " I judge who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " In a calm , steady voice , not looking sick no more , Tracker says , " You just keep doing what you 're doing , sheriff , and you 're going to learn something . You may think you seen some pawing for turmoil in your short life , but you just wait a minute . " Half the boys cleared out of the Wagon Tongue doorwaythen , and the other half went to the inside edges where they could use one eye . " Do n't go scaring me too bad there , breed , " Sheriff Bledsoe says . " I got a weakness for buck nuns . "  | " I 'm not trying to scare nobody , " Tracker says , soundinglazy and reasonable . " But I 'm too old to get jailed just for fun . " At the same time , he sounded sure as death . I seen death in his face when I looked then , not just hisn but anybody else 's who 'd care to join him . I think Sheriff Bledsoe seen it too , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boom out of his voice . " You 're going to do what I tell you , " he says . " You told me to do two things , " Tracker says . " And I believe I 'll take the first . There 's my horse . I was ready to get on it a minute ago before you started this hoosegow talk . " The sheriff done a little more wavering , not taking his eyes off Tracker 's dark set face , probably trying to decide if he 'd like to take a chance on getting a hole in his belly ( which might interfere with holding his groceries up out of his lap ) or risking a few hoots from the kids in the street and the boys in the saloon who all had their ears strung up so tight you could hear them singing like telegraftwires . " Well , maybe you did sober up a little , " Sheriff Bledsoe says , then give a half-turn , a hitch , and a swagger and says offhand , " Go on , git , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stiff across his belt , Tracker flipped Spud 's hitch loose and mounted up , his face going pale again . I started to get up on Jigger , but Sheriff Bledsoe says , " You there , Mr. Mouth-harp , you stay . " " But I 'm with him , " I says . " Looks to me you 'd both be a damsite better off on your own , " Sheriff Bledsoe says . " We 're going to have us a little chat with Miz Cherry Bastion . " " Tracker ? " I says , meaning to sound like I needed advicebad.  |p100He  shook his head at me , which I took to mean he did n't want me to get him in no gunfight if I could help it , and aimed Spud up the road . " Will you be all right ? " I says . Sounding pretty fair but not full strength , Tracker says over his shoulder , " I 'll meet you where you last played me one of them damn tunes . " And he started off north . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my arm now , and he says , " All right , Mr. Pants Kicker . Dancing Boy . " He let me take Jigger along as we started across the road . " All right , Mr. Liar . Miz Cherry 's beau . That lie 's going to last you about a hundred and fifty yards . "  |p101MATT  HAD HAULED the phaeton halfway out of the stable door and was putting the finishing swipes on it when we got there , and Sheriff Bledsoe says , " Is Miz Cherry home ? " " Yes , sir , " Matt says , giving hisself a rub on the back of the neck with the rag . ( I 've tried buggy polish myself since , and it does cut down on the sweat , but it 's the wrong color ' less you 're Tracker 's shade or darker . ) " Go on and listen , " Matt says . " It 's free . " So me and Sheriff Bledsoe stood there and listened for a spell . Her voice was still coming out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 'd taken some of the steam off the top now and was n't up to full whistle . I could n't hear nothing crashing nor slamming neither . But the sheriff did n't look too encouraged , and he says , " Reckon she 'd mind being interrupted ? " " I do n't know , " Matt says , perking up his interest . " I never seen anybody do it . " " You know anything about this younker here ? " the sheriff says , giving my shirt an extra twist.  |p102He  helped chop kindling this afternoon , " Matt says , and I could see him commencing to worry about that dime and his job . You know anything about him going to the dance tonight ? " the sheriff says . With her ? " Matt flicked a glance at me , not knowing what kind of trouble I 'd scraped up for us all before supper , and he says , " I do n't know , sir . You 'll have to ask Miz Cherry . " The sheriff give a grunt and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea . But her voice was muffled up for a little while , and it was long enough for him to get us started that way and up the steps to rap on the door . He took his hat off and elbowed me into remembering to do likewise , and I got myself braced for a second look at her , not knowing if it got harder to do as you went along , or easier . He did n't have to rap twice : there she was , still filling that pale-blue shirtwaist fit to bust and looking like she might catch on fire any minute . The screen did n't cut down the heat much , but I was glad for it anyway . " Well , what do you want ? " she says to the sheriff like he 'd already been there ten times that day to pick up the trash . " Good evening , Miz Cherry , " he says , ducking his head sideways and grinning . " This  --  uh , young gent says he 's been asked to go to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a crazy apology , still grinning . " With you . " " That 's right , " she says loud and clear . " Any objec-tions ? " " No , no , " the sheriff says , backing off and holding his hat over his belly . " Just a little fracas over at the Wagon Tongue and I wanted to make sure  --  "  | " Well , take your little fracas the hell on out of here , " she says , warming up some . " And quit interfering with my  --  " Then it was her turn to get stuck . She looked at me like she did n't know what to call me neither . The sheriff says , " I would n't dream of interfering with  --  " " You ! " she says , aiming it full force at me now , and everything about her was either curved or pointed or both . " Go wash up ! " " Yes , ma'am , " I says , backing off . " Miz Cherry , " before she could tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's a nice day for it anyway , " the sheriff says . His hands kept going around his hatbrim like it was them church beads the Catholics use to count prayers with . ( I could never figure out why they wanted to keep track unless they was only allowed just so many apiece . ) " Nice day for what ? " she says . He took a deep breath and give up . " Hell , I do n't know , " he says and turned around and caught up with me at the horse trough where I was deciding how to take a bath without shaming myself or if I should mount up and try to catch Tracker before dark . But Jigger was so slow and it was coming on for dark so fast , I was scairt of losing his trail and losing out on the dance both . I could n't make up my mind . " Just what in the hell did you say to me , Sheriff Puddle-gut Bledsoe ? " she says . Keeping his voice down , the sheriff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scattering around all the trouble they feel like and expect others to come running and picking up . " " What did you say ? " she says , heading up toward full volume again.  |p104The  sheriff turned around at her and grinned some more and tipped his hat and ducked his head and says out of the corner of his mouth at me , " I want you out of town by midnight , boy . Go on out and give the coyotes a treat someplace . " And he turned and headed for the alley under the oak tree like he had n't heard her . After a few seconds I seen the upper half of her ( which was the best part so far ) disappear from behind the screen , and I figured I 'd better get something settled with Matt who 'd re-commenced wiping the front spokes of the phaeton . " Do I stink ? " I says . He looked surprised . " How should I know ? " he says . And of course he was in the same fix as me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old straw and having enough manure on his boots to fix up the garden with . " How much daylight 's left ? " I says . He looked over his shoulder at the west sky and says , " About an hour . Why ? " It was going to be a good moon but not till a couple hours after sunset , and that probably give me just enough time to lose Tracker 's trail , and even chancing it and riding all night ( which Jigger probably could n't do ) straight for where he told me , it seemed likely I would n't find Tracker till mid-day tomorrow : he 'd try to rest up someplace down on the flat , get his strength back , if he did n't just pass out first . I could n't be much help unless I was to steal a horse and take off right now , and I did n't want to give Sheriff Bledsoe something to hang me for . I could n't help Tracker with my neck busted and my tongue sticking out . I stuck my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear-looking . " You got any soap ? " I says.  | " Saddle soap , " he says . But that would n't do me no good . And it was n't no use skinning off my clothes and renching myself as well as I could because I 'd just have to put them same whiffy clothes back on and the same time running the risk of having Miz Cherry catch me in the raw and get mad and mortify us both . So I done the only sensible thing and took off my hat and boots and belt and harmonica and clumb into the trough and laid down in it with my clothes on . Matt looked at me like I 'd just tried to eat hay and get between the shafts of the phaeton to be harnessed up . Some people got no imagination . " Well , if there 's no soap , is there anything that smells good ? " I says . " Got some Star-Crescent Liniment , " he says , gaping at me . " But it 's sort of scaldy . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I says , laying back and thrashing around a little . " Can you spare some ? " He went in the stable without saying nothing and come right out with two bottles , one green and one brown . He unstoppered the brown one and held it over so 's I could smell it , and it cleared out my nose and shook the back of my head like Mrs. Clendennon 's smelling salts that they 'd used on me once when me and a horse parted companytoo sudden . After I snorted it out , I says , " A little of that goes a long ways . No more'n a shot . " Matt poured in a dollop , and I stirred it around with my legs , enjoying the feel of the water and wishing the trough was bigger so 's I could turn myself loose . Because he was wrinkling his nose , I says , " Is it too strong ? I do n't want to be a plain nuisance . " " Well , I got this other stuff , " he says , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This time the smell did n't so much go up my nose asp106down my throat , sort of like arnica . " Least it 's different , " I says . " Maybe it 'll counterdict that other . " So Matt put in a dollop of that , and I stirred around some more to keep it from bunching up in one place , feeling sure of one thing : I was n't going to smell dirty . " What was that ? " I says . " Sheep-dip , " Matt says , watching me close to see how I was getting along . " You 're sposed to use a lot more'n that . " He still had the bottle unstoppered , looking hopeful , so I says , " That 's enough . I 'm just one sheep , not a whole flock . " I laid there stewing and paddling my hands a while , glad it did n't burn or nothing . As soon as Matt seen I was n't going to scald , he started rubbing the phaeton again . " I ought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he says , keeping his voice down . " What ? " I says , my ears switching around at him . " She was married over in Kansas but did n't like it none , and she pretends like it never happened , so if you hear somebody calling her a different name than Bastion , look out . Get ready to duck . " " Married ! " I says , feeling awestruck . " She do n't look old enough . " " She do n't look like a lot of things , " Matt says . " The best way to get along with her is pretend like everything'sjust fine and she 's right and you never meant no such a thing by what you just said . " " What did I just say ? " I says . " I mean , she likes to find fault , " Matt says . " Well , let her find it , " I says . " Anybody looks like her , they 're bound to have something wrong . Same as a horse . Maybe she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say something , but he just went on polishing . And I wantedp107to ask him if three of his horses had come wandering in on their lonesomes the day before and Miz Cherry on a fourth today , but I did n't like to pry , so I says , " Does she like the harmonica ? " " Ask me , she do n't like nothing a man likes , " Matt says . " Except maybe shooting and yelling . " I clumb out of the trough so 's I could commence wringingmyself out and drying off . " Then how 's come she wants me to dance with her ? " Matt looked at me like that was the dumbest question he 'd heard in a month and a half of suffering . " She do n't want that , " he says . " There just happens to be something else she do n't want worse is all . " " I do n't understand , " I says . " Then you 're off to a good start , " he says . Whiles I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little and found three more hoofprints I reckonized , then over by the stable doorway two more where somebody 'd emptied a bucket , and they added up to all three of the ones we 'd trailed , three different kind of horseshoes and different-shaped soles and frogs and heels , so there was n't no need to hunt through the stalls . I borried a mane comb and tried to get the snarls out of myself and out of my mind at the same time , but nothing would come exactly straight . When it was past seven o'clock and I was half dried off and most of the liniment and sheep-dip had vapored away ( or else I 'd got too used to the smell to notice ) and Matt had et a plate of beans with molasses poured on them and two biscuits which a woman he said was Miz Cherry 's ma handed him out the back door ( nobody seemed to recollect I had n't eaten nothing and I was shamed to say anything , not being hired help ) and whiles I was over under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as food anytime , the fun commencedin earnest . It started with Mr. Bastion riding up under the covered porch in a hurry and jumping off of his lathered bay gelding and clomping up the steps and through the side door already hollering something , and then whiles Matt run to take care of the horse , Sooger come busting out the back door , ducking low through the shadows that was heaping up on the east side of everything , and tore straight into the stable without seeing me or even lookingmy way . In a minute he come riding out the door on the same little bald-faced , sock-footed mare he 'd been on in the posse and cantered it around into the alley and galloped off as soon as he hit the straightaway . Then in another half a minute Miz Cherry come out the back door too , in less of a hurry , wearing a dark-red dress now about the color of the last sunlight , and she scouted around the yard , ignoring Matt who was hustling by and finally seeing me under the oak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Come here ! " I was barefooted , having hung my socks on the pumphandleto dry , and I thought of stopping to put them on , but they was sure to be damp , and I 'd have to struggle to get my boots on in front of her and look even crazier than barefoot , so I just went her way as I was , hoping for the best but knowing I was n't going to get it when I see her face up closer . " Did you see somebody come out the back door just now ? " she says . Matt was standing right there to ask , but she was asking me instead , and I knew Sooger 'd been telling her about me , and I got set to hide out best I could without lying . " Yes , Miz Cherry , " I says.  | " Did you see who it was ? " she says . " I think so , " I says . She waited for a few seconds , then says louder , " Well , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says . " Unless I was mistook , which has been known to happen . " She give me a quick going-over with her eyes , checking each part of my face like she was about to send me off to school . " How did you come to be in my yard this afternoon ? " she says . But I was ready for that one , even with her standing there distracting me something terrible . " Well , we had a bank robbery over in Sheepshank yesterday , and some of the posse I was on come down here , and I needed some feed for my horse , so I  --  " " I did n't do nothing wrong , " Matt says over by the horse-trough where he was trying to get Mr. Bastion 's horse interested in some liniment and sheep-dip flavored water . " You shut up and mind your business and get that horse rubbed off , " she says . Matt led it toward the stable , and she says to me , " Are you alone ? " " Not at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my feet which take up too much room frontways and sideways . She opened her lovely red mouth , red as her name , and started to bark at me , then stopped short before she even made a noise and says , " I mean , do you know someone named Tracker Byrd ? " Which was a sore subject because I thought of him then , with the night coming on fast , slumped on his horse or maybe slumped on the ground someplace with only his pain for company , and I did n't know if I 'd done anything right . " Yes , I do , " I says.  | " And he 's not with you ? " she says , peering close . " He was with the posse , but he went off by hisself , " I says . " He likes to be alone . " I could see her think of three or four other questions but not how to ask them right , and then she clamped shut for a spell to get everything lined up better . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bullion stolen from the bank yesterday . Is that right ? " " Yes , Miz Cherry , " I says , hoping I did n't look too embarrassed . " Do you think you could identify any of those men ? " she says . " Well , I might , " I says , making it sound doubtful , which it surely was . She seemed to think that over a bit and not mind it , and she let half a smile turn one corner of her mouth , which like to keel me over . She looked me up and down and shook her head . " Do n't you have any other clothes ? " she says . And I could tell she 'd finally changed the subject and I felt like I 'd just made it across a river on horseback . " Well , I got some others back home , but they 're no good either , " I says . " And do you go barefoot for the pleasure of it ? " she says . And I was about to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which could n't of been too noticeableanyway since she was n't no more'n five or six foot off and had n't said nothing , but just then , with a voice loud enough to seize up the gears of a rock-crusher , Mr. Bastionyells from the kitchen , " Cherry Bastion , I want you in here in one minute ! " She did n't pay him no mind but kept looking me over , sort of amused , the way you might look at a skewbald coltp111that did n't belong to you but was going to be somebody else 's problem . She says , " If you have n't dined already , would you care to join us in a cold collation before the dance ? " " I 've never et none of that , " I says . " But I 'd be glad to try . " " Very well , " she says . " Come with me . " " I have to get my socks and boots , " I says , starting for the trough . " There 's no need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real gleamer that did n't need much sunlight on it to look as white as the snow on a mountain . " God damn it ! " Mr. Bastion yells . " I want you in here immediately ! " So I was stuck halfway to the trough , not knowing which way to jump . " Are you sure it 's all right ? " I says . " Your father might not want me to  --  " " Oh , that 's just his silly way of showing his affection , " she says , giving a light laugh . Which was the first time I 'd heard her do that , and it sure give a harmonica a run for its money for sweetness . I decided to put on my socks and boots ( since I could n't be sure we 'd be eating in the kitchen but maybe some other room where I would n't look respectable barefoot ) , and it was just about as much trouble as I 'd figured . I had to wrench , kick , and finally sort of hop my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as stuffing sausage , but I got them on all right and up the back stairs in time to keep Miz Cherry from starting to yell , which she looked like she had a mind to . I brung my hat along to show I 'd learnt enough mannersto take it off , and she let me into the kitchen where there was a nickel-plated No. 8 Family Sunshine range big as a player-piano and a chopping block and an indoorp112pump and a hardwood sink and enough empty plates with flowers on them stacked up on shelves to feed half of Sheepshank off of and heaps of strange-looking vegetables , even purple ones , and wine bottles with labels as fancy as on my harmonica box and ladles and crocks and butcher knives , more'n I could keep track of . But there was a little lady in a long gray dress , wearing a frilly apron and her hair in a bun on crooked , and first I thought it must be a maid or a cook or whatever they have in big houses because Miz Cherry says to her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " But I wanted to meet your young man , " the lady says , smiling at me soft and dainty and kind of moony , with white powder dusted all over her face like she 'd had the itch . In a snappy voice Miz Cherry says , " He 's not my  --  " but then shut herself off and says , " Where 's Father ? " " I believe he 's having some brandy at the sideboard , " the lady says . Then to me , " How tall are you ? " " I do n't know , it keeps changing , " I says . " You 're a good-looking young man , " the lady says . " I am ? " I says . Miz Cherry 's voice went down a few notes and turned edge-wise . " Mother , now I want you to shut your little mouth and go upstairs and shut your little door , then shut your little eyes , and you 'll see just how nice everythingcan be . " From a room or two up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll give you ten seconds ! " " But it would n't be polite for me to leave our guest , " Mother Bastion says soft and calm . " How do you do ? " she says to me , holding out her hand knuckles first and fingers hanging down . But before I could take aholt of them and give them ap113kiss ( like I was bound and determined to do the way I seen a young man in a story-book picture doing it to an old queen just like he enjoyed it ) Miz Cherry says to her , " Get upstairs ! " " My name 's Eli , " I says , trying to keep things pleasant . " I 'm very pleased to meet you , Mr. Eli , " Mother Bastionsays . " Go on back where you belong , " Miz Cherry says louder and give her a little push . " I only wish I could , " Mother Bastion says . I took Miz Cherry 's elbow , which was my first touch of her and would n't ordinarily been easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time I laid a hand on an unbroke horse , and I steered her at the only door . She come along a few steps , then shook free , and says , " Do n't you dare paw at me , and what in God 's name have you got on you ? You smell like liniment . " " Well , it ai n't all liniment , " I says , glad to get her away from her maw before she done something shameful . People that have their own maws ( which I never ) do n't seem to know what to do with them . So to perk things up and change the subject I says , " My , oh my , Miz Cherry , you look a sight ! What kind of a dress do they call that ? " We was standing halfway into the next room where a big dining-room table shinier than a banker 's pants was gleaming at us with a carved edge like a pie-crust and claw feet heavier-looking than mine , and I seen Mr. Bastion setting at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , staring our way . Miz Cherry backed up into the kitchen again all of a sudden , gaping me up and down and touching my sleeve . " You 're soaked , " she says almost in a whisper and soundinga lot better that way . Then her face cracked up into a smile , then a snort and a giggle , and she hauled me for/ward into the next room , looking almost happy , before I could explain about the horse-trough . It was the prettiest room I ever saw but solemn-looking too with a thick carpet covered with dark flowery curlicuesthat made me wish I 'd left my boots off and a whole bunch of glass dangling over the table that looked like it was busted but had candles stuck in it so must of been there apurpose , and Mr. Bastion setting there looking dusty and tired and mad and disgusted and glancing from Miz Cherry to me like he could n't decide which of us to start on first , so he had a slug of brandy instead , and Miz Cherry says , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dance this evening . Eli Clendennon , my father . " I was set to shake or bow or whatever seemed mannerly , but he quit looking at me and just stared at Miz Cherry . " Here , you sit down here , Eli , " she says , hauling one of the high-backed chairs out a ways , but I knew that was n't right , so I hauled one out for her and waited till she 'd slid in , then hit her in the back of the knees with it just like I 'd been doing it all my life . I did n't know whether it 'd be polite to tell Mr. Bastion I 'd been on his posse in case he did n't recollect , so I just kept still and set down and had a look at the cold collationwhich seemed mighty like ham and cole slaw and applesauce and piccalilli and gingersnaps to me . " You must excuse Mr. Clendennon 's wetness , " Miz Cherry says ( which was nice of her because I hated to call attention to it myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accident . " " It was n't no accident , " I says . Mr. Bastion finally wrenched his eyes off of Miz Cherry ( which I did n't blame him for , even his own daughter ) and stared at me kind of tired and says , " Well , I wonder ifp115Mr . Clendennon would mind going out and falling into it again , whatever it was . I 'd like to talk to you alone . " I started to get up , but Miz Cherry held me down with one finger on my arm and says , " Oh , I thought we might all spend a little while getting better acquainted . I know you always like to have a few words with my beaux . " I 'd thought I was an excort , not no beau , and I felt like I 'd ought to ask the difference , so 's I would n't be too much of a blunder . But Mr. Bastion says , " I 've already had a few words with Mr.  --  ah , with this gentleman early this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes to show you rich men may be fools about some things , but they keep their eyes open . " Well , well , " Miz Cherry says . " What were you doing way up there ? " ( Meaning him not me . ) " I thought you usually took the valley road from Sheepshank . " That cold collation was just laying there helpless in front of us , and we even had china plates and hardware , but I did n't like to dive in by myself . The ham had been sliced so thin , they 'd almost missed it , but there was a good heap of it and some potato salad too , out past the cole slaw dish where I had n't seen it right off . " I had n't intended to do any riding at all , " Mr. Bastion says , " in spite of the fact I 'd had seventy-nine pounds of gold bullion stolen from me . " " I heard about that terrible outrage , " Miz Cherry says . " But then I had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yesterday evening , " Mr. Bastion says , lookingkind of sick to his stomach and pouring hisself a double-dollop of brandy . " I did n't know you knew Clem , Cherry . " " Clem ? " she says . " Clem who ? " and leant forward atp116me and says , " Wo n't you help yourself to the ham and whatever else you 'd like , Mr. Clendennon ? We 're very informal here . " " I sure will , " I says , spearing some of that ham with a fork and sliding a clutch of cole slaw over the edge of the bowl so 's it would n't drip too much and trying to leave some of the watermelon rind in the piccalilli ( which I had n't had but once before at Mrs. Clendennon 's ma 's funeral and had took a fancy to ) , and I had just got my mouth full without spilling nothing or letting it leak out the sides when Mr. Bastion raised his voice and deepened it like he done at the speech for the posse . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in front of this  --  in front of your beau ? " he says . " You just talk any time you please , " she says , smiling . " Very well , " he says . " I mean Clem Spanier my powder man who I regret to say was damn fool enough to give you that dynamite you wheedled him out of . " Mother Bastion come shuffling in from the kitchen carrying a deep-dish pie made out of something red , which could of been raspberry or rhubarb or cherry , and she set it down next to the ham and commenced rearranging the bowls and plates and humming a waltz and lifting her eyebrows like she was thinking about bobbing up on her toes on the count of three . Mr. Bastion only looked at her once , then stared off sideways at the mirror over the sideboard like he preferredlooking at hisself . I knew you was supposed to compliment the cook , but Mother Bastion did n't seem like the right one to try it on , and besides my mouth was full up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behave yourself ? " Miz Cherry says , not mean-sounding but sweet.  |p117Still  running over his points in the mirror like he might like to buy hisself someday but then again maybe not , Mr. Bastion says , " Do n't talk to your mother that way , and what did you happen to want with dynamite ? " " You 're mistaken , " Miz Cherry says , not the least bit flustered . " I have no dynamite in my possession whatsoever , and Mother will you please quit messing with everything . You 'll embarrass our guest . " I 'd cleared out half my mouth by that time ( and mighty fine it was too ) , so I says , " Oh , no , you go right ahead and mess with anything you want . Do n't mind me . " " Thank you , " Mother Bastion says to me . " Is there anything else you 'd like ? " But she 'd already moved the potato salad so 's I would n't have to stretch for it . " Who could ask for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Mr. Bastion says , switching around to concentrate on Miz Cherry again . " A very good question . What in the wide world is it you think you do n't have already ? Running wild is one thing . Understandable , I suppose . God knows I never wanted to be tame myself , but  --  " " Me neither , " I says . " How big a piece of pie would you like ? " Mother Bastionsays , running a knife down the middle of it and tipping the crust a little so 's I could see it was cherry . " Well , if you can stop just short of a hog 's share , that 'll be fine , " I says . " I like young men with appetites , " Mother Bastion says , slicing away and sliding the knife along the edge of the dish . " I 've been saving up , " I says . Raising his voice , Mr. Bastion says , " Did you know two bank robbers were killed last night ? Two . Shot dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what they call the Wages of Sin , " Miz Cherry says , turning pink in the forehead . " And some say there was three in on it , " Mr. Bastion says , giving me a glance . " That 's right , " I says , trying to keep up my end of it . I 'd never had no practice at dinner-table conversation , and it was hard to tell what was too much or too little , just like with pie , which Mother Bastion now plunked me down a slab of right on top of my ham and cole slaw and making them hard to see , let alone get at . " If a person is in need of money , even a lot of money , there 's such a thing as asking for it , " Mr. Bastion says . " There 's such a thing as getting turned down too , " I says . Miz Cherry give a nervous laugh , half at me and half at her pa , a kind I had n't heard her use yet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of worldly wisdom . " " I thank you kindly , " I says , glad I was between mouthfulswhich is another problem with talking at the table , whether it 's a cold collation or just beans : you 're half the time getting caught chawing and either have to gulp or just set there looking like the mumps . From back at the kitchen door Mother Bastion says , " Ask and ye shall have , seek and ye shall find , knock and it shall be opened unto thee . ' " Which sounded like a nice place to live but was n't no house I 'd been to . " Oh , be quiet , Hattie , " Mr. Bastion says , but she shut the door on him . He poured out another brandy , which was all he 'd et so far , and kept aholt of the bottleneck so 's it would n't stray off . " Gets more like an asylum every time I come over here . " I seen that drove Miz Cherry 's sperit right up through the top of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You damned hypocrite , you ! " she says , raising half out of her chair . " You coupon-clipping , note-switching , bank-skinning , land-grabbing , claim jumping , backdating , nickel-plugging , cold-deck widow-maker you ! Where do you get off criticizing anybody ? " The ham tasted all right with cherry juice on it anyway , so I was none the worse . Sounding calm , Mr. Bastion says , " You just show me that dynamite , and I 'll eat my wallet . " " That is n't all you 'll eat before I 'm through , " she says . But had n't either of them et nothing yet , nor even so much as loaded their plate . " Your mother used to have a tongue like that too , " he says . " Till you cut it out for her , " Miz Cherry says . " Well , you 're not going to do it to me . " " I want my gold , " he says . " You never wanted anything else , " she says , louder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " I says to cool things off and because the piccalilli wasrunning a little short of it by now . " I think I 'll go have a look around upstairs , " Mr. Bastionsays . " Maybe do some prospecting . " " Go right ahead , " Miz Cherry says , working up to full pitch . " You never found anything else you liked up there , and you wo n't tonight either . Mr. Clendennon and I are going to enjoy ourselves at the barn dance . " He looked from me to her and her to me , nodding , and says , " Go on , make a fool of yourself . Why should I care ? The day 's long past when you could shame me . And the same goes for your damned mother . Nowadays people just look and say , Well , that 's her again all right . ' " " You should n't talk that way about Mother Bastion , " I says.  |p120He  turned his sour-looking eyes on me and says , " Well , if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a prize too ? " I says . " I 've seen many a cub and poltroon and ninny and sack of oats and pailful of calf-slobber sit there where you 're sitting , pretending to be interested in my daughter for her own sake instead of her expectations , " he says . " But you 're the first one to tell me how to talk about my wife . " " Maybe they just never thought of it , " I says . And he flung his brandy glass at the mirror over the sideboard and hit it first try , busting them both , and he shoved his chair back so hard , it tipped over halfway into the front parlor , and all the while , Miz Cherry set there looking pleased with herself . I did n't have no time to worry should I stand up if he stood up because he was out of the room and stomping up the stairs out of sight , and in a minute we could hear him scaling things around upstairs and banging and rummaging and thumping from room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her ease and says , " Would you please bring the phaeton into the porte-cocherenow ? That is , if you 've had enough to eat . " Which I had n't but did n't want to say so . " Yes , Miz Cherry , " I says , getting up and scooting my chair back in place and heading for the kitchen door , then remembering to come back and wipe my mouth and chin off with the cloth napkin.  |p121BY  THE TIME I 'd hitched the black star-and-stripe mare to the phaeton ( she was one of the Big Three , wearingplain slippers , and Matt was mad at me and would n't help because he thought I 'd told on him over the kindling , which I had n't , to take his job off of him ) and drove it up under the covered porch , Mr. Bastion had commencedthrowing things out the upstairs windows on the lawn . The light was n't too good , so it was hard to tell what some of them was , especially after they 'd took a bounce off of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or come to pieces , but they was mostly furniture and boxes and clothes and other truck , and any other time I 'd of stopped to watch ( you do n't get to see a whole floor of a big house cleaned out like that any too often , and when was I ever going to see a harmonium sail twenty-five foot and land on its handle again ? ) , but Miz Cherry was waiting in a patch of lamp-glow from indoors up on the steps . She 'd picked a good spot to wait : the covered porch kept anything from lighting on her.  |p122To  judge by her face , nothing had went on at supper and nothing was going on now . It might 's well of been her father 's favorite way of working up an appetite or some kind of game they played on summer evenings so 's the hired help would have something to do in the morning : picking up and straightening up and carting things back upstairs and mending and patching windows and sweepingup crockery . She had some kind of rusty-colored gauze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I felt my throat go shut at the mere sight of it . There 's some women you could start out in their petticoat ( I do n't mean no offense , but just sposing ) or even less , and no matter what you draped over them or wrapped around or stuck on their head , even if you kept it up till there was nothing but a heap of laundry taller'n them and you could n't see nothing but silk and feathers , they 'd still look purely dreadful through it all . Men too , and I 'm one of them and should know but do n't much care . But there 's a few women , no matter how far back you start , modesty or not , and no matter what you flung over their shoulder or tied on , no matter what it felt like or what color  --  dishrags or dusters or antimacassars or doilies crocheted crooked  --  and no matter what kind of trash you set on their head or if you dyed them blue and poured slops over them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're going to get better-looking each time because each time you 're surprised at how there 's something different about them you never noticed . Women like that can make a tomcat out of a dead man or even Mr. Lathrop . And they 're a wonder and a terror and a caution and a snare and a blessing and a delusion and they are both sides of a sermon , the harp music and the sinner 's roast , and there ai n't much you can do aboutp123them but stand back and let them happen . Miz Cherry was the first one I ever seen and the worst . When I pulled up by the first step , I set the brake ( and a good thing too because the mare did n't like the sight nor the sound of what looked to be a wire flower-stand with a little trellis on top , full of some kind of green creepers , sailing upside down into the grass and sticking there before it keeled over ) and climbed up and tipped my hat and says , " Miz Cherry , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ box , only better . " And that 's another thing about those kind of women : if you never in your life said nothing bold nor flowery nor foolish nor worth blushingover , you 'll do it in front of them . Or wish you did . Or dream you did . I could of bit my tongue if I had n't halfswalleredit . She did n't say nothing , and up close , even in the flickeringlight , she looked a little sick of it all  --  not me ( I did n't count that much ) but the commotion maybe . Mother Bastion slipped out the door in back of her and peered at both of us like she wanted to be sure we 'd washed our face , and Miz Cherry caught sight of her and says , " Go lock yourself in the kitchen . " Looking at me , Mother Bastion says , " I ca n't help it . " " That was a wonderful supper , " I says . " I 'm sorry I could n't clean off my plate . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Miz Cherry says , " Mother ! Git ! " and stomped her foot like she was shooing a cat . Backing up through the door and pulling it shut , Mother Bastion says , " I never finished finishing school . " " Oh , God , " Miz Cherry says . " Let 's get out of here . " Which was fine with me , so I helped her up into thephaeton ( Matt had lit both the side lamps , and they wasp124gleaming away ) and clumb up after and flicked the reins and was glad we had a hard top on it to help shed the dew and the furniture . As we moved down the drive , she leant out her side and let go full blast with that voice of hers that could peel green peaches from a hundred yards . " Why do n't you burn it down , damn you ! " she yells . Mr. Bastion showed up in one of the front windows upstairs , and it looked like he had his vest off and his collar sprung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd already started going again , blotting him out , and she yells , " Then you can set up a riffle-box and wash the ashes because that 's the only way you 're going to find any gold ! " Then she set back in the cushions and looked pleased with herself . I 'd always thought living with the Clendennons ( or maybe sleeping in the loft only counted about hall ) had been a painful substitute for having my own family to argue with , but I was getting less and less sure as time went grunting by . What I could n't understand was where all this fighting come from , and it was n't just the Bastionsbut lots of others I 'd seen and heard too . They all seemed so tetchy , all chalked up and set to break , and I could n't figure out why they did n't all just light off by theirselves and leave each other alone . Why would anybodywant to live in a house where you felt like you had to walk outdoors and five hundred yards off in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy and humming a tune and taking the jolts in the road , which I could n't miss too good in the dark , spite of having a sharp eye for night-riding , because four hooves and four wheels and a strange road and the glimpses I could get of her face , andp125now and then her ankles , added up to too blame much information . And when we come out onto the main street , the ruts was so bad , I had to give us a jouncing if I wanted to keep moving at all . It was a first-rate phaeton with crucible steel springs and all the hickory ironed fulllength , but she finally had to give up just setting there ladylike and hang on to one of the fenders . " It 's not a race , you know , " she says kind of snappy . I slowed down much as I could . " I just wanted to getthere and get started , " I says . " What do they do first ? " " First what ? " she says . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or drink first or have a speech or what ? " I says , feeling excited . " You might as well pull in here , " she says , pointing at some room among buckboards , buggies , and hitched horses alongside a big square white meeting hall past the bank and the hotel with people chatting around the doorway and a fast stringy " Chicken Reel " coming from inside and the sound of thumping feet . " For goodness ' sakes , have n't you ever been to a dance before ? " I hated to say no , so instead I dropped off the parking weight on the end of its rope and helped her down and kept busy and smiling and did n't have to lie or tell the truth either . A lot of them people around the door looked surprised to see us , which surprised me right back since I did n't know none of them . They gawped and pointed and whispered and pulled back and chuckled , but Miz Cherry did n't say hello to nobody . She stuck her chin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to give me a case of quinsy , and I took off my hat outdoors so 's I would n't forget indoors , and we sailed right in like we 'd been doing it every night for a month , and I tell you , boys , if my feet was touching the floor , the news was n't getting through to my head.  |p126It  looked like the grandest place ever nailed up : there was a little raised platform at one end , chock-full of fiddlers and one with a silver-inlaid concertina , and a clump of people around a punch bowl and a string of old ladies setting against one wall under the coal-oil lamps and a square of mostly younger people out on the floor gyrating and bobbing and weaving and hooking arms a few at a time , and I had never felt more scairt and happy in my life , and then a man next to me says , " Twenty cents , please . " He was a pickle-faced , straw-haired man wearing blue silk suspenders ( which you would of had to tie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around over his head like I had n't heard and tried to concentrate on the fine music and the good smell of sweat ( except for Miz Cherry ) and not think about my empty pockets . " Twenty cents , please , " he says almost as loud as the old-timer doing the half-yelling , half-singing up on the platform amongst the fiddlers . Miz Cherry was n't paying no attention but glancing thither and yon , and I think we seen Lud and Sooger about the same time over near the punch bowl , both staringour way and talking and both with their hair greased down and clean-shaved which the boys at the barber shop must of earned their money the hard way . " I can probably pay you tomorrow , " I says to the twenty-cents man . " If I can find some chores . " But even whiles I said it , I felt deep under my lungs ( I do n't feel things in my heart much , like other people say they do , but where I catch my breath ) I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Byrd , so I felt shamed at lying and was about to take it back . But Miz Cherry suddenly seemed to figure out what was going on , and she fished into a little purse like a redp127sock with drawstrings and pulled out two-bits and give it to the man and walked off without waiting for her nickel , but I could n't let her do anything like that : I held out my hand till the man grudged it into my palm , then caught up with her over in a corner where she was untying the gauze around her hair . " You forgot your change , Miz Cherry , " I says , holding it out , but her eyes was sneaking off sideways looking at Sooger , and she did n't seem to hear me . Well , I could n't drop it down the front of her dress ( meaning no disrespect , but that area had been drawing my eye so much , I felt like something ought to go down that beautiful way inbetween what I ca n't begin to tell you about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in my pocket for later . The band started sawing away at something I did n't reckonize , and the dancers busted out of formation and commenced moving in couples or leaving the floor , and after sneaking a final look at Sooger ( who was scowling at us both now ) she turned on me with that bright , **27;1973;TOOLONG smile and held her arms up . I knew enough to toss my hat on a chair , but after that I was stuck . " Do you want me to do what they 're doing ? " I says , trying to get the hang of how their feet was moving out on the floor . " Wo n't take but a minute . It do n't look no harder'n hop-scotch . " Her smile shrunk up a little , but she kept it on . " Do n't you know how to dance ? " she says . " I do n't know , " I says . " I never tried . " " Great God , " she says , looking genuinely flustered for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She kept her back turned so 's Sooger could n't see her face and says , " But everybody knows how to dance , " still keeping her voice down . " I learn fast , " I says . I held out my arms halfway , butp128they did n't match up with hers , and I snuck a look at the couples out on the floor . " I 'll do it just right if you give me a minute . " But I seen she was about to give up on me and maybe go off to Sooger and get in trouble and never see me again nor leave me touch her arm nor be her excort anywhere nor show me her eyes up close ( they was a different color every time I looked , so do n't ask me what ) nor smell her nor sit at her dinner table nor even probably groom her horses for her , and I felt desperate strange like the music was coming through solid rock and me with my ear stuck to the ground trying to guess where it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I says , " That Lud and Sooger  --  stay away from them , please , Miz Cherry . They 're doomed . Tracker Byrd 's going to find them sure . And you too . But I 'll tell him you did n't mean to shoot him . And I only saw them at the bank , not you . Not for sure . And if somebody went and shot two innocent men , there 's going to be some hanging around here , and I sure would n't want it to be you . " I had poured it all out in a rush like water flung out of a bucket , but when I left off so 's she could say something , I seen there was no change in her face but the color : she was white as her maw and did n't even blink . So I says , " After all , you did n't do nothing but steal your daddy 's gold , did you ? And it runs in the family , do n't it ? " But I still was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a dance neither . Instead , she turned around and crooked her finger at Sooger , which was the last thing I 'd reckonedon . Lud come right along with him , and they cut across the edge of the dance floor , bumping a few people out of the way , and Sooger made a racket because he 'd left his spursp129on , which you ai n't sposed to do indoors unless there 's sawdust down . Soon as they was close enough , Miz Cherry says , " All right , I was wrong , I believe you . " Then to Lud , " Go get Bledsoe . " " Yes , Miz Cherry , " Lud says , not even glancing my way . " Hurry , " she says , and whiles he headed back for the punch bowl where I seen the sheriff helping hisself to a ladleful , she says to Sooger , " I lost my temper , but I do n't usually lose my wits too . " He took her by the arm , which I did n't like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he says , " It 'll be a pleasure making up . " She jerked loose and says , " Leave me alone . Tend to business . " " Leave her alone , " I says . He faced me square , like he was glad to have something to do he thought he understood . " You just stand still and keep quiet , boy , and maybe you 'll stay alive long enough to comb your hair tomorrow . " He did n't have his gun on , so I did n't worry about him much , but I worried about everything else . " Miz Cherry , I did n't mean no harm , " I says . " I wo n't tell . I just wanted to warn you . " She studied my face a few seconds , then shook her head . " It was too far away , " she says . " I did n't recognize you . I thought it was two old men , and I  --  " " Do n't feel bad , " I says . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think he 'd bear no grudge . It 's just he ca n't stand to be throwed off the track is all . " " I do n't want to talk to him , " she says to Sooger . " Get him out of here . " " Yes , ma'am , " he says , grinning.  | " She do n't like to be called ma'am , " I says . " Why do n't you just come along with me and Lud and the sheriff , " he says . " Like to have a talk with you . " " No thanks , " I says , looking at his spurs . " How 's come you 're wearing them can-openers indoors ? You 'll drowned out the music if you start dancing . " He put his hands on his skinny hips . " Maybe you 'd like to take them offen me , " he says . " You just unbuckle that little strap on the side there , " I says . I seen Lud and the sheriff coming and could n't think of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sins to speak of . Sooger seen them too , and because help was on its way , I guess he decided to take a swing at me . I leant back just far enough to let him miss , and he done a fancy dancestepwhen the rowels on his spurs , first one and then the other , near scooped out from under him as he staggered . Then he come back for more , his face rosy and his hair hanging down in front , and he did n't have no business trying to fist-fight with nobody , not even Tracy Watkins or Mother Bastion . It 's just like night-blindness : some can see in the dark and some ca n't . And some can fistfightand some ca n't . And Sooger belonged to the bunch that could n't lick jam . He might just as well of tried playingthe bull fiddle as hit somebody . He could move his fists around sort of like you 're sposed to , but he did n't know where they belonged . So we done this little dance whiles everybody come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing the shufflingoff , and the music quit , and various lunkheads commencedyelping at us , and out of the corner of my eye I seen Lud and Miz Cherry each chattering away into one of Sheriff Bledsoe 's ears . Sooger tried to feint with his near-fist , then swang his off-fist around like a corral gate , and when I ducked , he up-ended hisself good and proper this time , using both rowels on the floorboards at once , and landed on the back of his neck with a clunk and laid hisself out . Which is the best way to fight because I never had to touch him and get my harmonica fingers broke . And that 's how I come to find out all about the inside of the Crockville Jail because that 's where Sheriff Bledsoe took me before I could get in another word with Miz Cherry or find out whether I could dance.  |p132THE  SHERIFF bum's-rushed me about thirty yards down the road and banged the door open and hustled me past Deputy Cash and up the stairs into a dim corridor with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clanked the door shut , all the time paying no mind to anything I told him or asked him or explained in my respectfullest voice , and he finally says , " I 'll be right back , " and went thumping downstairs again where I heard a couple more doors slam . And then I finally had time to sort it all out , including my last sight of Miz Cherry which consisted of her back turned and looking the other way . She was just as beautifulbeing contrary , but she did n't have to write it down on a billy dew to say she wanted shut of me . I was n't heart-broke ( I could feel it beating away inside ) but more like wind-broke . I felt like Jigger must of felt trying to cough that hay dust loose , and I set down on the floor ( which was the only place to ) in the gloom and the stink and recollected how I 'd learnt about dancing from Isabelp133Wyatt and Charlie Skinner who used to practice behind the Mercury Saloon sometimes when no one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going and I was trying to get my mouth-harp to sound and feel like them and the music together . But there 'd never been no chance for me to try it  --  official and with a real girl  --  till tonight , and my high-flying , puffed-up , very first stretch of courting had slid me right through that dance hall and into jail like I was a sheep in a chute . It was discouraging . So I got out my mouth-harp , which the sheriff had n't thought to take off me , and tried to remember some of the music them fiddlers had been sawing up , and right away I felt better . I was whole-skinned , was n't I ? And I still had plenty of years to ride through , did n't I ? And how was I ever going to find out what it was like being in jail if I did n't try it ? And maybe a good strong dose of Miz Cherry was like a dipper full of Dr. Hammond 's Tar Expectorant and would clean me out in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more about the robbery and the gold than anybody else ? From the cell across the way , a scratchy voice says , " Welcome to the Crockville Clink , boy . But the first rule is Rest in Peace . " I reckonized Sheriff Spitzer and made out the hump of him laying on the floor . " Are you all right , sheriff ? " I says . " Well , I may be by tomorrow , " he says , hawking and spitting . " Is that how long people stay in here ? " I says . " I ca n't do that . I got to go find Tracker Byrd . " " Give him my regards , " he says . I thought it over some more and says , " But I have n't done nothing wrong , not even getting drunk . "  |p134S|pitzer  took a deep raspy breath . " We all should of stayed in Sheepshank and let that gold run away by itselfand been polite and kept the wool out of our teeth because I 'll tell you something , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sudden so 's I could barely hear it . " I do n't know what 's happening to you , but I ai n't just in drunk trouble here . They 're looking for one more candidate . Better watch your step . " " Candidate for what ? " I says . " I ai n't running for nothing . " Spitzer started to say something , but shut hisself up . We both heard the scuffling up the stairs , and in a few seconds I made out Lud standing inbetween the cells and smelt the bitter-sweet booze wafting down from him . " Well , ai n't this pleasant , " Lud says , letting go a belch . " A real heart-warmer . " " Got a drink on you , Lud ? " Spitzer says . " No , but I got a couple in me , " Lud says , commencing to chuckle . " That do you any good ? " " I spose we could tap your gut , " Spitzer says . " Watch your lip , mister , " Lud says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bars , and you ai n't no sheriff now . Any trouble , and you 'll be playing checkers with your nose for six months . If something worse do n't happen sooner . " Sounding cold sober , Spitzer says , " I pick my trouble very careful , Lud . I might just pick you . " I 'd been doing a little mouth-harping just to keep occupied , and now Lud spun around and says , " What the hell are you making that racket for ? " " Practice makes perfect , " I says , but truth to tell , I was n't getting the full hang of that thirty-two-holer which seemed like enough territory to rent out . " You ever tried playing one of them things at the other end ? " Lud says.  | " What other end ? " I says . " Yours , " he says . " Hard enough to do it up here , " I says , pulling back a little further from the bars , because Lud come up close now , with part of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tonight , " he says , quieter . " In front of his girl . Which you was trying to horn in on . A green-horn like you . " " I was Miz Cherry 's excort , " I says . " By request . " His voice turned even meaner . " And what are you now ? " And I do n't know what made me do it , but I 'd been hearing an awful lot of yelling and taking an awful lot of messing around , and something inside me just got sick of it . I 'm a pretty fair yeller myself if I 've a mind to , so without even raising up I hollers , " I 'm Tracker Byrd 's prentice learning how to play the mouth-harp what the hell are you ? " The stone walls give my voice an even bigger send-off than I 'd expected . Lud jerked backwards , and I seen Spitzer make a grab at him through the bars but missed , and the same time heavier feet come clumping up the steps , and Sheriff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll start busting heads . " He unlocked my cell door and hauled me up and out by the shirt , which was his favorite handle and says , " How 's your recollections , boy ? " I did n't know what he was talking about , but I says , " Pretty good , I guess . " " Well , I got a little improver set up for you , " he says , shoving Lud out of the way and commencing to haul me down the steps . " If you 'll just tell me where we 're going , I 'd be glad to oblige , " I says . " I do n't need all this help all the time . " He swang us around the newel post and out a side door into the dark between buildings . " You need more help than you think , " he says . We was in an alley now , and the only light come from the backsides of stores or rooming houses or whatever , and he led me past a couple of sheds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good patch of moonlight where it was shining through a rickety back staircase  --  a full moon , lighter than the lightest sorrel , and there , hitched to a low rail with the moonlight skimming along his near shoulder was Bay Boy , having hisself a drink in a horse-trough full of shadows . I knew him without looking twice because I was used to how he looked at night , sneaking him out the back of the stable and walking him till I was sure Mr. Clendennonwould n't hear no hooves pounding , used to the look of him moon-shiny or not , and it looked like bad news for Bill Millerson who 'd rented him : the saddle was gone . This only took up a couple seconds , and then Sheriff Bledsoe hustled me through a half-open back door into a low white room with two candles burning in wall-sticks and what looked like two long tin-lined wash tables with three-inch sides on them and drain holes down at the ends , and there was somebody laid out on each one with wrinkled sheets slung over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be the heads . " Take a deep breath , boy , " he says . I took a shallow one instead , but there was nothing too bad in it . " You know where you are ? " he says . I heard Lud snigger behind me , and I says , " I would n't be surprised . " The sheriff peeled the sheets down past the faces and the naked necks , and it was Bill Millerson and Ed Stalky , not earning no dollar a day at the moment for posseyingp137or nothing else and no fun at Candy Kate 's . Ed looked all cleaned up and better'n usual , but Bill Millerson looked like he 'd lost an argument with a Vibrating Hitch Cultivator . Mr. Clendennon was going to have a long wait for his money . The sheriff says , " Well ? " " They was both in our posse , " I says . " Ed Stalky and Bill Millerson . " " Anything else ? " he says . I had n't seen nobody dead before except animals , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " They 're doing pretty fair so far , " I says . " When 's the services ? " " We do n't have services for bank robbers , boy , " the sheriff says . " These here are the two you seen up in Sheepshank , ai n't they ? " " No , sir , " I says . " Tell you what I 'll do , " the sheriff says . " I wo n't ask for no more'n one . Do n't matter which . Just take your pick , and you 'll be on your way home tomorrow with a Mexicancigar stuck in your face . " I tried to think hard and fast , which ai n't my specialty . " Well , they sure look awful familiar , " I says . " Course they do , " the sheriff says , relaxing his grip on my collar and giving me a chance to start pulling my shirttail loose in front , pretending I was scratching and thinking . " They was always in some kind of trouble , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him and Sooger . The sheriff give me a little shake , and I had one front shirttail all the way out . Lud could n't see it , being behind me , and I says , " Well , it happened just before dawn . " " And I bet that rising sun just happened to shine right on their face , did n't it , " the sheriff says . " You got to understand , boy , we are talking about a two-thousand-dol/lar reward . " He said the numbers like they come out of a hymn book . For that , I 'd turn a boy like you inside out , tie him in a knot , and sell him for saddlebags . " I acted puzzled and fidgety and worried , which was n't too hard to , meanwhile tugging out my other front shirttail , and I says , " What bothers me most is what 're Ed and Bill 's brothers going to do when they hear about this ? " You tell them they better stay in Sheepshank if they want to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's right , " the sheriff says . Now all 's I need is your name on a piece of paper down at the bottom and I 'll write what goes on top and Lud can witness , and everybody'llbe as happy as a fly on new-laid cow-plop . What say , boy ? " I pretended to get an itch under my belt in back and tugged up most of my shirttail there whiles I was at it . " Being dead do n't look as bad as I thought , " I says , taking a last look at Ed and Bill . You would n't like it none , " the sheriff says . " Now come on back and sign the paper or we 're going to have to move these boys over to make room for you . " " We 'll learn you how to dance the Denver cakewalk , " Lud says . On the end of a rope . " A skinny little dark-complected man in a black coat too big for him come through an inside door and says , Is everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Hummel , I 'm busy , " the sheriffsays . " This happens to be my undertaking parlor , " the man says . " If you do n't mind . " " Then go on undertake yourself someplace , " the sheriff says . Stiffening hisself up like he was practicing , the under/taker says , " I am also acting in my capacity as deputy coroner . You ca n't order me around . " " You do n't have no more capacity than a shot-glass , " the sheriff says . " Git ! " " What 's going on here ? " the undertaker says . " I said you could look at these corpuses , not molest them or bring in strangers . " The sheriff gentled down a little , taking a couple extra breaths , and I got my shirttail all the way out , front and back . " You want to go on doing business with the city and county ? " the sheriff says . " I do n't do business , " the undertaker says . " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those granite wax mining candles you 're letting spill all over my good floor ? " Like he was tired of wasting his hard-earned belly-fat on all this useless bother , the sheriff says , " Lud , will you please show this professional man how to pick out one of his own goddamn boxes up in front ? " " Be a pleasure , " Lud says , latching on to the undertaker'scoat ( the way the sheriff was clutching my shirt ) and heading for the inside door . I waited till Lud had got the show started so 's the sheriffwas watching to see how was he going to get the undertakerpast the door jamb with his arms flailing like that ( probably one of the finer points of being sheriff , such as which place on a man hurts the most the quickest for the least waste motion or how do you make somebody leave go of a lamppost ) , and then I done a great deal in a hurry , which was all the time I had for it . First , I set right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been poleaxed , the same time flinging my arms up stiff overhead , feeling my har/monica crunch a little in my hip pocket when my butt hit the boards , but having no spare time to fret , and my sleeves peeled inside-out like the skin off of a catfish only a thousand times slicker , including the loose cuffs , and second , I rolled under Bill Millerson 's corpus table and lit out for the door , keeping as low as a coyote and hoping to be half as smart . And I was all the way through and digging my toes into the alley before the gun went off  --  whether the sheriff'sor Lud 's , I did n't know  --  and kicked up a handful of shale twenty foot past me , and then I was around the corner of a shed and out of their sight for a few seconds , and I cut back slantways across the alley and was glad Bay Boy 'd been hitched tight because I went ducking right under his nose and into his trough and laid out full length , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a record . He only reared his head twice , and his reins held , even when he shifted and give them a yank , and I laid there with the water slopping over my bare chest and breathed as soft as I could through my mouth whiles Lud and Sheriff Bledsoe come pumping around the shed , telling each other which way I 'd went and crunching and paddlefootingpast . Doors commenced opening and slamming and opening and slamming and other people yelling What 's up ? and Goddamn it ! the way they do whenever a ruckus gets going . Bay Boy 's hinching around and scufflingwas n't no different from what he 'd of been doing anyway without me getting soaked under his muzzle , so I guess nobody took notice . I reached up and slipped his two half-hitches loose ( somebody 'd meant him to stay put ) and at the same time give him a good smell of my hand and arm , which I hoped still had some of me on them besides liniment and sheep/dip and Miz Cherry , and he seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then I started whispering to him , just like I done back at the stables in Sheepshank , telling him what we was going to do and what we was going to see and how good it was going to feel to run in the dark , and he drunk it all in : I could see the outlines of his ears twitching around at me and only now and then jerking halfway toward the scrambling and yelping and windows being flung up , down the alley toward the jail . When I tugged the reins , he come in a little closer over me , and I knew he reckonized me now because he let me set up in the trough right beside his neck , with him blocking whatever dim view there might be from where the commotion was still going on , and I clenched onto his mane . on his off-side with both hands in case he took a mind to start moving quicker'n I could , and then I got up in a crouch with my boots full of water and got his reins in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see if he 'd stand still for it , having to grope sidewayswith my ankle like a dog taking a leak , and he only shifted backwards a step or two , lifting me right out of the trough . I hauled hard with both hands till I slid all the way onto his back , still laying flat and mostly on the off-side , and after a couple of skittery paces , he just naturallystarted walking up the alley away from the jail like he had n't quite made out what I wanted to do yet but figured he 'd take a stroll whiles he found out . We went in and out of the shadows and past the undertaker 's , about five seconds in all , before I heard somebody chiyukking behind us , and then I squoze up to normal riding position except still laying forward over his mane , and give him a double kick in the flanks , and off we went , me praying neither of us would get shot ( I counted three gunshots right off but some might of been doubles ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it smells the edge of town . I headed us straight down the alley and through somebody'sorchard and over a crick the color of that silverinlaidconcertina way back at the dance that was probably still going on without me and then into the sagebrush at a good canter , which I reckoned was better'n most behind me could do , even with the moon out , and I was right : I turned back and seen the shapes of two riders get as far as the orchard , then haul up short and loose off a shot in the general direction of Cheyenne . But they did n't seem to come no further . After I 'd rid about five minutes , I stopped and listened hard as I could and dismounted and used my ear on the ground too , but none of them was risking their horses ' ankle in a prairie-dog hole . I did n't hear no thumping but my own blood , no fiddle music and no feet stomping to it , no earthquakes near nor far , not so much as a weasel introducing hisself to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someplace to get her own way , which did n't look much like my way now.  |p143AFTER  THAT , I arched me and Bay Boy around like a rain-bow , slow and gradual , till we was headed back for town cross-country ( I 'd of skipped roads even if I 'd found any ) , aiming to hit it as close to the Bastions ' house as I could , and I only missed by a hundred yards , which would n't win no prize but was n't bad for night-steering if I do say so as should n't . I had to be sure Jigger was took care of till I could get her back to Mr. Clendennon who 'd be charging me by the day against my grubstake and probably against my whole Future , including Bay Boy too , most likely , since Mr. Clendennon would n't let Bill Millerson get in the way of business just by dying off . I could n't take Jigger along because she was too weak-winded for where I had to go , yet I did n't want to just leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Crockville had n't been serving up a very steady supply of Tender Mercies and Providences . Besides , I needed her saddle . The night air had dried me off some , but I could n't tellp144which was sweat now and which was trough-water , but they both had me shaking by the time I come to the Bastions ' stable where there was a lamp hung outside the door , probably to light the phaeton home , but nothing shining out of Matt 's cubbyhole off the tack room when I stuck my head past the edge . The good part was Jigger 's saddle hanging on a nail by the door . But the worst part was Jigger was n't hitched where she 'd been , and I stood there , holding Bay Boy still , staring at the empty shadow that should of been Jigger and wondering if I 'd been horse-thieved and knowing that 's what Sheriff Bledsoe was going to be saying  --  or more likely yelling  --  about me , even though Bay Boy was something like my own , me being Mr. Clendennon 's employeeunless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to turning away , to leaving it go at that , but then I seen the kitchen light on and the back door open and something hulky sticking out of it . At first I thought Mr. Bastion had begun on the downstairs ( he was finished cleaning out the upstairs , it seemed like , because nothing else was flying out the windows ) and now was trying to shove something off the porch and down the steps but got stuck . I 'd of reckonized Jigger sooner if she had n't been hangingout of an unusual place like that where nobody 'd expect to see a horse 's behind , but soon as I got adjusted to the idea , there was no mistaking that willow tail of hers : she was halfway in Mother Bastion 's kitchen , which was right friendly of her or somebody but a vexer for me . I hitched Bay Boy to the trough where I 'd had my first bath of the day ( it smelled like somebody 'd pumped in fresh water ) and took a running sneak up to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it hadp145been known to do , having to zigzag amongst the wreckagefrom upstairs . Through the lacy window I could see Mother Bastion feeding Jigger some kind of vegetables ( I know corn , peas , carrots , and rhubarb by sight , and I had a pretty good idea about pumpkins and an even better idea about watermelon rind if it 's cut up and pickled , but this was n't none of them ) , and I could of just stayed out of it then , knowing Jigger was in good hands , even if being taught bad manners . But something made me go up the steps alongside Jigger , patting her flank and chucking at her so 's she 'd know it was me , and squoze in edgewise through what was left of the doorway and says , " Is everythingall right , ma'am ? " I did n't have no hat left to tip and no shirt to my back and must of looked a sight , but Mother Bastion never even blinked . " I always believe in being kind to strangers , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and purple . " He 's been just as good as he can be . " Well , you could n't blame her making a mistake like that since Jigger had n't brought her female half indoorsto be looked over , so I says , " She 's a mare , Mother Bastion . " " That 's all right , " she says , taking more purple and white slices out of a colander and shaking the water off of them . " Name of Jigger , " I says . Mother Bastion nodded like that was just fine . " Jigger , " she says . " Would it be too much trouble to look after her a day or two ? " I says . " I got to go up in the mountains , and she 's not fit . " " Everybody has fits up there , " she says . " Gold fits . "  | " Yes , ma'am , " I says . " It 's been known to happen down here too . " Jigger was munching away like it was Christmas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be glad to look after her . You run along . All you young people : always running . " " Well , at least we ai n't all running in the same direction , " I says . " Yes , that 's a blessing , " she says , commencing to pump a panful of water . " You did n't like the dance either , did you . " That took me back a ways , but I managed to say , " Not too much , ma'am . " " I did n't like it , and I was n't even there , " she says . " Are you in need of a shirt ? " I could n't very well say no since I was standing in plain sight , but I heard some charity ; n her voice , and it made me feel squirmy . " I got another one back in Sheepshank , " I says . " This ought to do , " she says , setting the pan down for Jigger and rummaging amongst a heap of what I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She pulled out a gent 's white dress shirt with a long stiff front and no collar on it and the back wide open that you was sposed to tie together with drawstrings . " He threw down mostly formal wear . Or else the other shirts are still out in the grass somewhere . " " I could n't take that , ma'am , " I says . " It must of cost two dollars . " " I insist , " she says . " Hold out your arms . " I done so , and she skinned me into it and turned me around and tied me up like an apron , making me feel like a fool but warmer.  | " We ca n't have you catching cold , " she says . " And I had a pair of cuff-links here somewhere . Found them in the washtub once . " She pulled open a drawer under the cupboardsand started clawing through . " Never mind , ma'am , " I says . " I can just roll them up a little . " I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going too far . " I 'll get the shirt back just as soon as I can . Mrs. Clendennon might wash it for me , maybe . " " And I want you to take some food along too , " she says . " Wherever you 're going . " She kept on hunting in the drawer , rummaging things left and right and taking out shoestrings and buttons . " And if you have to answer a call of nature , we have indoor facilities . " But I did n't want to take up any more time or break something I 'd never tried before or run into Mr. Bastion in the hall . " I done a whole day 's posseying free of charge for Mr. Bastion , so you tell him I hope that makes up for the shirt , " I says , digging in my pants pocket and locatingthe nickel . " And this here 's Miz Cherry 's change from the dance , and you tell her I owe her twenty cents when she comes home . " She did n't pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the drawer . " Here they are ! " she says , soundingglad . Then right after , her voice sunk , and she says , " Oh . I forgot they were that kind . " And she let them plunk down on the table like they was hot . " I do n't like having that kind of trash in the house . " They was a pair of horseshoes and looked like gold to me . " I 'll do just fine rolling them up instead , " I says , showing her how to fold the cuffs up tight . " And that reminds me , " she says , digging in another drawer and hauling out a little lace-edged lady 's wipes folded around something . " I 'd like you to do me a favor . "  | " Yes , ma'am , " I says . " I want you to get rid of these  --  " she hunted for a word but could n't locate it "  --  things for me . " She set it on the table and unfolded the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , stamped and shiny , about half the size of a harmonica . " Cherry brought these home yesterday , and I told her she should never play with that dreadful , dirty stuff . So if you would n't mind just taking them along  --  " I tried to reckon what Tracker would want me to do : if we had these , we 'd know what the rest looked like , and they was part of what we 'd been hunting for , and they was evidence for me to take back and show up Tracy Watkins with in front of Mr. Lathrop , and maybe I was going to earn some of the reward after all , and that made these here half-belong to Mr. Clendennon by right of grubstake , and I was in a total tempted fluster . " You sure you can spare them , ma'am ? " I says . " That is , if you would n't mind handling them , " she says . " They give me the postules on my neck . " So I wrapped them back up in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could change my mind . " I wish you 'd take the cuff-links too , " she says , looking at them with her mouth pulled back like she 'd just seen a mess . " They 're all he ever got out of the other one . " " The other one what ? " I says . " The other mine , " she says . " If only they 'd both been empty . " " Whereabouts is it at ? " I says , feeling like a cheat on Tracker who was having to do everything the long way around . " Oh , up in the mountains somewhere , " she says , which was n't going to save any too much sign-cutting . But then she says , " Up along Dudley Creek , I believe . It belongs top149Cherry now , and that 's a shame and a lesson to her , and she never got enough of either shames or lessons . Or anything else , it seems like . " She was looking so unhappy and short and skinny inside her long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but did n't know what was respectful enough , so I finally just says , " I would n't trust both halves of Jigger in the house , ma'am . She 's wind-broke , but not house-broke . " Mother Bastion passed out some more vegetables , and Jigger chomped away . " She 's been a perfect lady so far , " she says . " A lesson to us all . " " Is Mr. Bastion all right ? " I says , half-expecting him to come banging in any minute . " Maybe you should give this gold to him . " " The problem is not getting it , " she says real slow like she was explaining something to a child , which I hope she was n't . " It 's getting rid of it . And do n't worry about Mr. Bastion . He 's gone . He 's gone looking for it again . " She give me a plate with ham and bread on it , and I slabbed up a sandwich , not asking for the piccalilli since I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sandwich neither which I stuck inside my shirt , having to reach around back to do it . It hung down front like a little potgutbut was safe anyways . " Well , good-bye , ma'am , " I says . " I 'll be back for Jigger in a day or two , and keep track how much I owe you for feed , and I 'm very much obliged to you . " Then I kissed her on the cheek before she could duck , not doing it very good because I had n't kissed nobody since Angie Springford let me do it if I 'd show her how to cure girth galls . Then I slipped past Jigger and down the steps , and Mother Bastion says , " Now you put all those things back where they belong . They belong underground . Like all of us.  |p150Before  anything else could go wrong , I slung Jigger 's saddle blanket and saddle on Bay Boy , cinched up , climbed on , and aimed him back out of town the quickest way , using the full moon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slow country . The moon had a long ways to go that night across the mountains , and so did I.p151THE FIRST THING you want to do night-riding is not fall asleep because your horse gets confused and heads for home , if he 's got one , or just wanders off into the first grass and starts having a cold collation . But I was n't about to fall asleep , being too busy trying to use my brainpanwhich most of the time felt like it was full of dishwater . And the second thing is make up your mind where you 're headed so 's you can be thinking about the lay of the land before you get to it , going over it in your mind 's eye ahead of time because you ai n't going to get much out of your real eyeballs except tears from strainingthem . And I had made up my mind after a few false starts and fancy notions : I was going to do exactly what Tracker told me  --  head for the place he 'd been shot  --  only I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I figured to make it by dawn instead of wasting the night going slow down on the level , trying to make sure I did n't pass him by in the dark , asleep or passed out . That way , if he had n't made it to that boulder we 'd hid behind ,  |p152I  could backtrack downhill by daylight and have a better chance of seeing him . And the third thing is hard to describe because it 's why most people are no good at night-riding , even them that wants to be , and if it was easy to tell about , nobody 'd need telling , they 'd just know without trying . It 's like this : as soon as you 're not riding on the flat , you have to think two ways ( not both at once , but one after the other ) . You have to feel with your eyes and your ears and your whole body , reaching ahead about thirty foot ( unless you 're fool enough to try galloping on broken ground where you 'd have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the rest of the world but that thirty-foot stretch and never looking at nothing straight but beside it . Somehow , we all got a blind-spot straight on , but if you think you 're looking at something and want to see it as good as you can in the dark , you 've got to shift left or right of it , and it 'll sharpen as much as it 's going to . Anyway , you do that about half a minute or less , and then you switch to the opposite , because if you do n't you 'll get yourself gullied or blind-drawed or worse . And the opposite means thinking about the whole shape of everything for about five hundred yards left , right , and ahead  --  more , if you can do it  --  so 's you can pick and choose the general way you 're headed by tossing the skyline , whatever else you can make out , and everything you can recollect if you 've been that way before into that brainpan and stewing it . You do that for about thirty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do each one right , and if you try shifting back and forth as fast as you can blink or fidget or if you only do one and not the other , you 'll get stuck in a hurry , even on the mooniest night , or your horse will bust a leg or show you how to eat gravel.  |p153If  you 're going downhill , you 've got to think like water ( stopping short of clifts , though ) . But now , heading up , I had to think like a goat or least make up the difference between a goat and what Bay Boy come by natural . He was strong and did n't spook easy : nighttime makes some horses just want to stand still and wait till the sun shows up again , and some act like they got blinders on or even blindfolds and would n't shy if they was about to get cowcatcheredby the Denver and Pacific Railroad . But Bay Boy loved to cover ground , any kind , and he treated night like it was just some more weather . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but when you 're on crumby rock and not sure whether you already come to that split stump where you have to veer left a little for fear of missing the dry crick bed that takes you up to the first ridge that looks like the only one but ai n't and you ca n't see more'n about fifteen foot and the coyotes are commencing to yip , you 're liable to forget how to act sensible . And if you 're thinking about a beautiful girl half the time when you 're sposed to be remembering whether it was the rim of this gulch that had looked like a slider to keep clear of or the next one and whether that squawk you just heard off to the right and overhead in the pitch dark of a rock slab where the moon could n't reach was something with four feet , two feet , or wings and whether you 're hearing the wrong kind of echoes from the hooves  --  too deep and too empty-sounding for where you reckonedyou 'd got to  --  and if that beautiful girl keeps snappingat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her up , you 're bound to make your way in rough country mostly by luck , which is what I finally done when I come out onto a clear , half-grassy stretch with a crick running along one side of it where me and Tracker had stopped forp154water on the way down . I had n't expected to be there for another hour , and I 'd been remembering some parts of the trail in the wrong place or had skipped over them in the dark unbeknownst and still had n't lost myself , which worried me because I did n't want to run my luck thin before I needed it worse . It was an uphill piece of hardscrabble , mostly clear , with a few silvery-looking bushes and some low rocks stark and bleachy in the moonlight , and I thought to myself , Well , here 's one place I ca n't get lost or in trouble for about seventy-five yards , and whiles I let Bay Boy drink about half the crick water he wanted , I was already thinking ahead to some switchbacking we was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boy for a rim-rocker and a stayer and a gentleman , I wished I could turn him into a burro for about an hour . And then I seen a horse rear up from behind a boulder upstream , about where the clear stretch went jumbly and darker . At first I was scairt at seeing anything move , though a bear or any other night-critter will move off if it 's got a chance to , and then I was glad when I seen it was a horse and gladder yet when I seen nobody was riding it , and then I was disappointed when I seen it was n't Tracker 's ( too herring-gutted and long in the barrel ) , and then I was scairt all over again when I seen how it was acting . There was n't no wind and probably nothing much to smell , but the strange horse seemed like it 'd just been mortally insulted up the nose and commenced snorting and whiffling and tossing its head and shaking it . ( I always liked to say he or she with a horse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call this one an it till I had more to go on . ) Bay Boy jerked his mouth out of the crick and stared , ears forward , stock still , and I done likewise . The horsep155come closer now , zigging down the slope and zagging back , and the more I could see of it , the less I liked . It was n't doing nothing the way horses usually like to do , even when they 're feeling snorty , but acted like it was champing at something I could n't see or else had commencedfighting with Bay Boy from fifty yards off , more like a bull than any horse I ever seen . Every now and then it 'd stop and rear and strike out with its front hooves . It was either a dappled gray or the moon was tricking it out , and it was coming closer all the time , working its way down the edge of the crick but shifting its ground and kicking at bushes . By that time I 'd decided it was a genuine wassup , an outlaw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its territory and meant to find out whose skull was the hardest and whose front teeth could peel the most horsehide . But then I seen it was worse than a wassup and worse off too : its mane was at least twice as long as any I 'd ever seen , from groomed show horse to mustang that did n't know a comb from a tomahawk , and its tail was so long it drug on the ground . I 'd heard tell of horses that 'd been drove crazy from getting to like purple loco or some kind of rattleweed , but I 'd never seen one before  --  they usually kilt theirselves fighting or just plain starved to death on locoweed which they 'd chomp on even if there was good grass right next to it  --  and right now I was getting a whole lot better look than I wanted to . It was coming closer , only about twenty yards off , and Bay Boy still had n't made up his mind what kind of fellow bonehead this was , but I could feel his withers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before he decided which way to vote . There was n't no fences to jump nor gates to swing shut nor help to yell for ( unless you count up in the sky , butp156the moon and stars did n't look interested ) , and I did n't have no gun . I could of bailed off like a coward and let it and Bay Boy have it out , but I did n't fancy having my horse wounded or kilt or maybe run off someplace a mile away in the night , and I figured maybe Bay Boy needed me as much as me him right now , to make him sheer off and run when he might not feel like it . I 'd heard that a locoed horse did n't have much wind , though this one had plenty to spare for blowing out its nose and its hooves moved quick as I could follow wheneverit lashed out at the air . It reared up high about ten yards off and slashed half a dozen times with each one , and I seen it did n't have no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them after running off . At least a plain hoof was better than iron , and it moved its hocks with a funny kind of jerk , almost like stringhalting , which I hoped meant it could n't run too good . Ever since it 'd popped into sight , I 'd held Bay Boy in short , not wanting him to do nothing I did n't know about ahead of time , but now when this rattlehead come even closer and I seen the lather on it and the foam gleaming all around its mouth and the sticky tears under its eyes and down beside what looked to be a white blaze , like it was moon-blind on top of everything else , I give a hard kick with both heels and hung on . The rattlehead was just rearing up again , and Bay Boy took off like he meant to hunt up the source of the crick , getting a double clop in the buttocks ( it felt like ) from them front hooves to send him on his way , and I was glad to see he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing with the likes of that beast with me for referee and water boy and maybe undertaker and maybe even fellow corpus . We had them seventy-five yards to gallop , and evenp157that would of been foolish ordinarily , what with the busted rocks and maybe potholes or stray stumps , some too small to see quick and all of them ankle-busters . The rattlehead turned and galloped after , whinnying and half-screaming like it was being branded and keeping up with us , and when we come to the end of the clear ground where any more galloping was n't just foolish but deadly , it was only ten yards behind and going strong . Bay Boy had always been light in the mouth , even the first time I rode him , and I did n't want to insult him now by yanking his bit like he was the worst dead-mouthed old stable-owl in the county , and he 'd of probably done what I wanted just with neck-reining , but because both our lives might of been hanging on this next move , I felt like I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not like rating him down from a dead run to a walk and then turning him , but near as possible getting him to meet hisself coming back without losing speed . He spun back so tight , he almost flung me off into the Great Unknown ( which looked like somebody 'd been practicingmaking tombstones for five or six hundred years , though I did n't have time to admire the view , what there was of it ) , and come back down the slope pretty near in his own tracks . I do n't know what the rattlehead was used to in the way of chasing , but it did n't seem likely it 'd seen that one before , and it kept going into the rougher ground where the shade of the thirty-foot-high draw we was in made it like going out of a lit room into a dark one , and judging by the ten different kind of noises its hooves made whiles it was getting straightened around and after us again , I 'd say it had n't found no red carpet on the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a canter all the way down the lip of the crick to where we 'd started , and it was n't till I'dp158turned him again ( gentler this time ) that I had a clear look at what the rattlehead was dreaming up now . It 'd lamed itself in its off-hinder , not bad , but enough so 's it could n't keep up with the likes of Bay Boy on the flat , which was very cool comfort at the moment since I did n't dare ride out of this seventy-five yard box where nothing was flat except my feet and where I had enough room , maybe , to keep me and Bay Boy from being bit or stomped . If I 'd tried slow trail-riding up slope or down , the rattlehead would of had us both kilt , probably getting crippled itself whiles it was at it ( Bay Boy was no sweetpea ) , but that would n't do us no good all slashed up . The rattlehead had decided it was King and Queen of the Wild Horses , and it stood in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high to straighten its throat like a coyote and commenced making more different kind of racket than I 'd ever heard out of a horse before . It went through the whole barnyard , including the cats and turkeys and then threw in the coyotes for good measure , maybe just because it 'd been getting jealous of them up here through the long nights whiles it chewed on rattleweed and dreamt whatever rattleheads dream ( I 'd hate to imagine what it is , because even a sane horse has nightmares , and all you have to do is ask somebody who 's slept amongst them , or right overhead , all his life ) . Me and Bay Boy sat out the performance , and I would n't of minded if it 'd wanted to sing all night , just as long as it left us go our way sooner or later . But it was too calm to last ( maybe calm ai n't right because Bay Boy 's withers was trembling again and his ears kept switching and if I 'd had any hackles they 'd of rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much groundp159our way but more like it was laying out a challenge or marking off a line we was n't sposed to cross . Well , I was n't going to do nothing I did n't have to do , and it seemed like Bay Boy had the same opinion , and I 'd been concentrating so hard , my mind seemed to wander off for a few seconds like you might get up and stretch if you been setting too long , and the next thing I knew , the rattlehead was coming straight at us , not as fast as it 'd run uphill but only favoring its off-hinder a little . Going downhill at a gallop feels fine , I guess , even if you 're loco , but I was holding Bay Boy down in the corner by the crick , and behind us there was n't nothing but trouble , nothing but walking country that had n't been smoothed out none by the moonlight , and the first thing you want to keep in mind when you 're galloping downhill is how much room you got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't thinking of nothing but us , and it did n't slow down or flounce or sidestep or nothing sensible when it come close . I kicked Bay Boy a couple of good ones , and he was off again , straight up the edge of the crick , and when I looked back , head low and tilted sideways , I seen the rattlehead trying to set down and rear up at the same time and skidding right into the crick and up against the rocks on the other bank , glancing off and scrambling to keep from rolling over . It did n't tip all the way , but had four hooves off of the ground there for a while and must of took a good soaking , which it probably needed , before floundering upright and out onto dry land again . I stopped at the top of the clearing and set there , waiting to see what was going to happen now . It limped a few paces , shinier than ever and dripping crick water and moonlight and its head hanging till the long manep160touched the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away like a snow-horse the boys at the Mercury made out in the road late one winter and hitched to a post . Its off-hinder was even lamer , and it must of popped something else too because it did n't seem to have no spunk left and would have to go back and fill up on more locoweed before it could start making our life miserable again . I watched half a minute while it decided it did n't much care for walking on three legs , and then I took a big chance and got us going again , leaving open ground where I could out-dodge it till one of us three died of old age and getting the hump of land between us quick . Maybe out of sight and smell would be out of its mind , and that 's exactly where I wanted to be : completely forgot . I walked Bay Boy fast as I dared amongst all-sized rocks where the ground was washed and tilty and you could n't tell where nothing was next , faster than he wanted to go because he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And I tried hard as I could to think both near and far , one at a time , but now I was having to think and worry backwards too , with my ears straining to catch the rattlehead maybe trying to follow us . Finally Bay Boy turned stubborn where a boulder had stuck up against an overhang near the head of the draw , just as I was about to get us climbed out of what seemed like the most troublesome territory , and instead of kickinghim on , I reined him in the rest of the way and held still to listen . We was near enough to the boulder for me to lean up against it without dismounting , and I done so , pressing my ear tight , partly to cool off and partly thinkingit might be what Tracker would of showed me how top161do , though I did n't know how he could give me advice when he was n't even there . And I heard the clopping coming loud and plain , right through the rock  --  three clops and a short one , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rattlehead was looking for more commotion and had us in a place where I could n't make Bay Boy run , maybe not even walk . When I took my ear off of the rock , I only had to wait about fifteen seconds before I could hear the same sound coming through the air , closer and uglier . The rattlehead was n't bothering to think like me or worry about near or far and probably all it had in its mind 's eye  --  if that was n't moon-blind too  --  was me and Bay Boy 's skulls which it wanted to see the insides of . It took some persuading to get Bay Boy moving again , but he finally begun picking his way up the dark slope , hating every step because he could n't see no better than I could . It was like wading across a lake , only the lake was over your head , and whenever I looked down , all 's I could make out was the front of Mr. Bastion 's fried shirt I was wearing . Maybe the rattlehead had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it had closed up the gap between us , and seemed like it 'd be able to bite Bay Boy or me in the rump in about a minute , whichever it happened to fancy . I tried to speed up Bay Boy 's walk , but he was doing the foolhardy best he could , not knowing no more than me whether there was going to be something under his shoes when he plopped them down or not . My head come out into full moonlight before his , and I was looking along the halfway level stretch about a mile east of where I was sposed to be going , and when Bay Boy got his nose up into it and could see what was what , hep162perked and turned as lively as a barn-sour colt getting his first smell of open meadow . It seemed so bright out compared to what we just blinded our way through , for a minute I could n't understand how anybody 'd have trouble riding at night , and I almost kicked Bay Boy into a run and kilt us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hard to notice . We 'd only made about twenty yards when the rattleheadcome stumbling and limping up into the moonshine after us , its nose almost touching the ground like a hound dog running a scent . It caught sight of us and yanked its head up high and let out another neckful of noises that would of been more at home in a chicken coop but sounded scarier than anything natural . Then it made a dash at us , front feet dishing out to the sides and its offhindermaking it drag and skate and half set down . If it 'd had a man on its back ( and the only worse place to be I could think of was in front ) they would n't of been keeping company long . I wheeled Bay Boy around to face it , feeling like I 'd ought to be getting used to this foolery pretty soon if it did n't rain . There was n't no crick now with us for bait , just a mean drop-off that led back down to where we come from if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and no stretch clear enough for a run , so when the rattlehead reared up to use its front hooves , I was n't as quick off the mark in digging Bay Boy past , and if it had n't been lamed and throwed off balance it 'd of busted something instead of just creasing me a bad one on the thigh , rippingmy jeans , and glancing off of Bay Boy 's near flank . It must of been like taking a hard prod from my heel because Bay Boy leapt up three and a half gaits for about five seconds before he realized he did n't like trying to run in all this rubble , and by that time he 'd took us against ap163low rock-face not much taller'n me but too tall to get over . I did n't know which way to turn nor whether . I did n't want Bay Boy to get buffaloed over that drop-off , and I did n't want him to stand and fight and get hurt and maybe throw me and bust my neck , and a whole set of miserable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sermon where the sinners get tweezed , peeled , and roasted . I did n't believe what happened next , and still do n't , and do n't expect nobody else to neither . Whiles I got Bay Boy turned to face the next run at us , a man in what looked to be a white fur robe with some kind of short horns on his head come jumping off that low rock-face , making worse noises than the rattlehead , and he passed us by , running , his face whiter than my shirt , whiter than the moon in back of us , carrying a club a foot and a half long with feathers hanging on it , and not going directlyat the rattlehead but taking a cut-off angle , and when he was close enough , he swang that club with his whole arm and body and cracked the horse behind the ear and knocked it down to its knees , then hit it again before it could scream or bite and laid it out flat.  |p164I  SET THERE on Bay Boy , not knowing if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and not having no idea what I was looking at , especially when the man in the white robe flung his head back and let out the best imitationof a coyote I 'd ever heard , including the rattlehead and Mort Parker 's old bitch who used to sing along with the real thing whenever the pack come close enough to town . The top layer of my blood was commencing to freeze over , and it did n't warm up any when I heard an answeringyippity howl ( coyotes take their time getting up to the high notes like they was thinking over how sweet it was going to be when they finally hit the roof ) . It come from further along the ridge , and for a few seconds , I seen another man in a robe against the skyline before he crouched sideways out of sight . If they had n't both had horns instead of ears and a tail , I 'd of thought they was part coyote . The one standing over the rattlehead ( who hadn'tp165moved no more after the second clubbing ) took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I got set to start dodgingagain . A club was n't no worse than two hooves and a mouthful of teeth , and I 'd been scairt for such a long stretch I could n't improve on it now . My heart would n't go no faster than it was already going , and I could n't breathe any less nor sweat more . " Inu-na-ina , " the coyote man says , which did n't get us no further along towards daylight . " Ba-ni . " He give hisselfa tap in the chest with the club-head . " Na-wat . " " I thank you kindly , " I says , sounding squeaky unless my ears had shut off . " I was just passing through . " He pointed west with the club , which was the direction I 'd been hoping to go before the rattlehead had caught up again , and he says something too fast and thick for me to get aholt of . But when he commenced walking that way and looking back at me , I knew he wanted me to come along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was being helped or captured or something else I could n't think up . Yet at the same time , it did n't matter much . I could n't walk Bay Boy away from a man who could run like that , if he was a mind to use that club again . I twitched the rein and went along . And in the middle of all my calculating , I turned my head back for last looks at the rattlehead who was getting a little rest for a change and did n't have to worry about where its next rattleweed was coming from . Maybe it still had some seed in its belly , and it 'd sprout up next spring and grow another patch of trouble for some other poor fool that did n't know no better than eat everything in front of him , like the cougars and coyotes and crows and buzzards was probably going to do when they got a sight or a whiff of dead horse tomorrow . I had n't meant it no harm , and it had n't known what it meant , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead at the end of . All 's I could hope was this coyote man did n't mean no harm either and did know what he meant because he was n't going to get much help from me . At the moment I felt like the biggest waste of time since the last speech by Mayor Packwood when he told us all about the future of Sheepshank and could n't think up nothing interesting to happen in it . He seemed to let Bay Boy set the pace , which was fine with me , and we moved along steady and slow , keeping well away from the drop-off . I did n't see the other coyote man ( if that 's who it 'd been ) nor hear nothing else , which was fine with me too , since I felt like I could use a week or two of laying back in the hayloft and practicing my mouth-harp and not having to learn nothing harder . The coyote man walked stiff-legged and silent like he was wearing snowshoes which seemed like a pretty good way to walk at night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was ever fool enough to try anything like this again . But when I seen we was headed for the very place where Tracker and my other mouth-harp had got shot , I turned scairt again , wondering if they 'd caught Tracker too or whether him being part Injun would help or if we 'd stumbled on one of them sacred battle or burial grounds Tracker 'd told me about and was going to get our comeuppancefor it . Figuring I had nothing to lose but my hair and my horse , I says , " Do you happen to know Tracker Byrd ? " The coyote man turned his chalky face back at me ( and I hope to tell you it did n't look like nothing human in that light ) and says , " Ba-ni . " He might of been smiling or snarling , but there was no way to tell . " Hatani-ina-danena , " he says.  |p167Which  left us back where we 'd started from . We rounded what was either a half a slide of boulders or part of a dry crick bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the confusion , feeling dumb and wore out and disgusted ) and there up ahead was the clearing with the crooked stump in the middle of it and the big boulder on the far side where we 'd done our crouching . It looked different by moonlight , but even with my brains gone lame in all four feet I could reckonize it . And around on the far side of the boulder where it was overhung ( which was why I had n't seen it glowing sooner ) somebody had lit a small campfire . I followed the coyote man straight for it without dismounting , giving the stump Tracker 'd used as a listening post a touch for luck on the way by , and by the time I 'd rounded the boulder he was already talking seventeento-the-dozento the man sprawled out on an ashy-looking bedroll with his hat off and his arms clenched in like he was cold . It was Tracker , his face near as chalky as the coyote man 's who , I seen now , was wearing paint . I clumb down off of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over to make sure he was all right . He left off talking to the coyote man and glanced me over the same as I was doing to him , and he says , " If you ai n't the biggest clump-head I ever seen with the naked eye . How did you get up here ? " I had n't expected no question like that . " Why , I rode , " I says . " At night ? " he says . " Well , I 'd of done it by day if there 'd been one , " I says . I could tell he thought he was being sassed , so I says , " How 's your arm ? Are you all right ? " " I 'll be all right if I do n't get worse , " he says , which sounded more sassy than me.  | " I 'd of come sooner , but I had to go to supper and a dance and jail , and I had to find something fit to ride , and then I run into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard all about that part , " Tracker says . " Where 'd you learn to night-ride ? " " I learnt myself , " I says . " I did n't have the way up figured out exactly because we only come down it that once , and the way down ai n't necessarily the best way up . He poked a little stick in his fire . " I 'm much obliged to you for telling me , " he says . But I was getting good at calculating when he did n't mean what he said . " I do n't mean to tell you your trade , " I says . " If I had a trade , I 'd be able to do trade with it , " he says . " So if you think I 've got a trade , you just leave your blankets and beads and busted mirrors and copper wire and whiskey jugs out there by the post . And if you do n't mind , you can just leave out all but the jugs . " He was n't sounding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes kept shifting past me like he did n't have no faith in the dark . I did n't know how to help or do nothing else neither , but I says , " Would you like a ham sandwich ? " He shook his head whiles I was trying to get my hand around through the slot in back to get at it , and he says , " What in the living hell have you got on ? " " Well , it 's a long story , " I says . " I borried it off of Mr. Bastion , sort of . " I got the sandwich out all right , but it looked pretty disorganized . " I think I must of sweated on it a little . " " Salt pork and coffee and combs and needles and thread and smallpox and bigpox and best of all , whiskey , " he says.  | " I do n't have no whiskey , " I says . " I never thought of it . " " That beats not thinking of nothing else , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . He did n't have that sick-sober greenery around his gills like I 'd watched old Hanley Meadows work hisself up to one morning after Mr. Clendennon had rented him a horsestallone night for half-price because he probably would n't eat much hay or oats . Tracker had more of a fever-and-chills look . The coyote man let out another string of Injun talk , and Tracker nodded along with it like he was hearing the latest bad news from back home . " Are they fixing to do something bad ? " I says , keeping my voice down and respeckful . " They 're going to doctor me , " Tracker says . " Is that why they 're all dressed up ? " Tracker give me a bright , watery-eyed look . " These are my people , " he says . " Inu-na-ina , the Arapaho . They 're mostly down on the plains , but this along here 's old huntingterritory , and this is what lookouts 're sposed to wear . I asked a couple to go keep an eye out for you or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd make it this soon . Maybe you ai n't hopeless after all . " It was the nicest thing he 'd ever said about me , and I felt swole up and happy , partly because he was talking clearer and sharper . " I thank you kindly , " I says . " This one 's called Na-wat , Left Hand , " Tracker says . " He 'll be a chief someday . " Left Hand smiled till his paint crinkled . " Ehiha-sinichi-nit , " he says , raising his knobby club that had the business-end covered with what looked to be stretched gut . Tracker managed a weak little twitchy smile . " That'sp170my name , " he says . " My real name . Means He Is Turninginto a Bird , ' and it ai n't far wrong tonight . " " How they going to doctor you ? " I says . " You 'll see . " But all I seen when I looked around was the darkness being cut here and there by moonlight , a little campfire , an Injun dressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wounded man commencing to talk funny again . I could just barely remember what I was doing up here . What was I prenticing for ? " A pint of whiskey for a buffalo robe , " Tracker says , raising his voice like he was drumming up business . " Robe worth five dollars in St. Louis . How 's that for a bargain ? A pint of piss-cutter 's got six cents of alcohol in it , so a forty-gallon cask of goddamn alcohol thinned to whiskey 'd fetch six thousand dollars in trade , and done so many a time right out there at that stump , boy . " I was standing there holding the ham sandwich and not knowing what to do with it or me . " You want me to go back down to town and get some whiskey ? " I says , not liking the idea for fear I 'd get jailed again and wind up next door to Bill Millerson 's corpus or , worse , run into Miz Cherry and not know what to say , but willing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at me again . " Did you have some dinner with that locoed horse on the way up ? " he says . " I 'm not thirsty , I 'm mad . Run me out of town ? I 'll show them bastards how to run before I 'm finished . Do n't talk to me about whiskey . " He left off to give his lips a couple of smacks like he 'd just had a shot to clear his throat . " Bi-gushish , " Left Hand says , pointing at the moon , then letting his finger sink down past it to the craggy horizon southwest of us . " I know , I know , hai-nawa , " Tracker says . " They 've gotp171to do their medicine-making when the time 's right . But forget the whiskey . I do n't need it , now or never . I spent most of my life twenty miles from whiskey and twenty foot from paydirt and never no closer than twenty inches from a good-looking woman , and what I say is the hell with it . Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one hand . " Now give me that sandwich . I need my strength back . " I was excited and wore out and did n't dare set down or I 'd fall asleep and miss everything , yet there was n't nothing for me to do standing up but start knee-buckling . So I finally set a ways off near the horses , not wanting to soak up Tracker 's fire when he needed it and keeping out of the way in case the medicine commenced flying . Then , spite of myself , I begun to lose track of what was going on , blinking and jerking awake and sagging off again . I 'd forgot my bedroll back at the Bastions ' stable , and my saddle was n't much of a bed without it , and I could n't use Bay Boy 's blanket for fear it would n't dry out by morning ( which did n't seem like too far off ) , so I just made do with me and the ground and nothing much inbetweenbut chunks of stone . But even they can seem friendly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no harder to set on than my mouth-harp nor that gold in my pocket ( I was keeping my own lookoutthe best way I knew ) , and they all had some reason for being there , even if it was only for me to leave my mark on them , so 's somebody coming along someday readingsign could say , This here 's where one of them slept . See where his saddle scratched ? See them little stones knocked out of their craters ? And there 's where his boots was setting with nobody in them . " Left Hand had built a second fire out in the clearing , but the boulder was between me and it , and I did n't knowp172if I was sposed to pry or not . And whiles I was trying to decide , I fell asleep three or four times . Once I seen him sail past Tracker 's little fire which was guttering out , letting his white buffalo robe puff out on both sides , with Tracker laying dead still on his back either watching or asleep . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the palms chalked white flapping together sometimes like a moth trying to catch a flicker of firelight and missing , and then he was gone back around the boulder , and I was too tuckered to follow even with my mind 's eye which felt like it had sand in it just like my other two . Twenty miles from whiskey , Tracker 'd said , but I knew what he really meant . It was the same as saying twenty miles from home which he 'd never had a one of , just like me , except if you count his shack with that crushed-glass garden shining around it . And I seen it in my sleep then or one of the times I was falling in that direction : nothing but a plain shack to lay down in and wake up none the wiser , without no skirts or petticoats or baby-soppers hanging outside , only long johns with a button off of the seat , and no flowers in a can but the tiny little kind that grows out of leftovers . And then somebody pulled down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was flapping his hands over me like he done to Tracker and wailing high and deep in his throat , and I was n't scairt at all but just laid there and listened.  |p173I  WOKE UP , arms and legs flailing in broad daylight , thinking the bank had blew up again , but it was only Tracker trying to knock the sand out of a frying pan by hitting it on a rock . He had his color back and was even using his hurt arm whiles he tended the fire , but the sheet bandage was gone , and it looked to be wrapped up in some kind of raggedy gray roots smeared over with something like a pastern poultice . He nodded at me , actinghalfway in a hurry , and soon as I got my neck straightened out and the sleep out of my head ( I rememberedsomebody singing , long and wavery in the dark , and it give me the chills to recollect ) , I went over to help . " Where 'd you get that horse at ? " he says . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Does Bill know you 've got it or can I expect the sheriff up here after us any minute now ? " " That 's Bay Boy , and he belongs to Mr. Clendennon , and Bill Millerson and Ed Stalky got shot for bank robbersin Crockville , " I says . " I seen them laid out . " Tracker held still with the skillet dangling . " Them twop174never held up no bank , " he says . " Ed Stalky could n't even hold up his pants half the time . Was it that sheriff done it ? " " Seemed like it , " I says . Tracker shook his head . " If he keeps running a town like that , I 'm going to take my trade elsewhere . " " You want me to make the coffee ? " I says . " If we had any , I 'd be glad to turn you loose on it , " he says . " If I had some of that brew , I would n't need to climb around this damn mountain : I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so whatever the Injun medicine had amounted to , it had n't been too big a dose . I looked around the boulder into the clearing but did n't see no trace of the coyote man . Tracker seen me doing it , and he says , " Left Hand went off before dawn . " He flicked a half a smile and hesitated like he did n't know if he should say the rest . " He told me I should give you a name . " " Me ? " I says . " I got one . " " Well , take two , they 're small , " he says . " Besides , I mean a real name . " I kept still then , turning shy , and when he seen I was n't going to say nothing else , he says , " We decided on Ata-hata-hina-na . " " I thank you kindly , " I says , trying to learn it straight off but not making it . " Say it over . " Tracker said it five times , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " I says , feeling scairt to find out it might be something bad or funny or too true . " Oh , something like He-Wants-to-Win , ' I guess , " Tracker says . I thought it over , and it felt fine . " Can I still be Eli too ? " I says.  | " I reckon you can be anything you want , " he says , rummagingsome jerky out of his saddlebags . " Eli Ata-hata-hina-na , " I says , trying it on for size . " It sure takes up a lot of room . " We had to go roundabouts to get up to the little hangingvalley , which is like a gully that 's been lopped off short by something washing across its path , and Tracker found the trail without using his hat on it or even dismounting . " See where the mica 's shining in that slab ? " he says . " Boot scratches . " We both set there for a spell looking down at the boulderwe 'd hid behind and the clearing beyond it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ai n't going to give both with a thumb-buster . " " Maybe they was n't aiming to kill but just to scare us off , " I says , hoping I was right . I had n't told Tracker about Miz Cherry yet and did n't know how to go about it , him being so mad about his arm and getting kicked out of town and tying the two together like the same person had did both . But he did n't pay no attention to the idea . " Come on , let 's cut for sign , " he says . And just watching him go to work got me all sparked up again , even though I figured I already knew what we was looking for . After a little ways up slope , Tracker dismounted to get a good look at some sign in a patch of grass , and leaning over his shoulder whiles he squatted and bent some stems back and forth between his fingers , I tried to forget about Miz Cherry so 's I could get on with my prenticing.  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , sir . " " I was n't altogether level with you last couple of days , " he says , not looking at me but the grass . " There was lots more things I could of told you about all this , but I did n't know you too good and seemed like we run short of time . I ca n't tell it all because some of it 's ways of feeling and guessing , and you just have to break in them boots yourself . No man can do it for you . " He touched the grass again . " Now , it 's been a whole twenty-four hours since our little friend passed through here . The sign 's just about gone , and by this afternoon , I 'd of had to hunt hard for this . " He showed how small clumps of the grass was weak at the bottom , even though they 'd all straightened up and you could n't see no trail with your eye . " A man walking through grass stomps it down forwards , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stomp it down at all unless he 's in too big a hurry to care . " We walked the fifty yards up to a washy-looking razorback , and Tracker pointed to a couple of clear footprints at the edge of a dry claypool . " See the toes digging ? " he says . " See that little slip there where it ai n't slippery nor steep ? See how short the stride is ? Now , spose you throw your bucket in that and see what you come up with . " " Somebody carrying something heavy , " I says . " Right the first try , " he says . " Give the boy a stick of spruce gum . " He squinted along the edge where there was four or five shelves stepping down into a gully full of scrub and more boulders , and then he pointed . " There , " he says . I seen the dried horse apples too , just as he said it , in the shade of a bush where she must of had the fourth horse tied up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Crockville.  |p177We  led our horses down to the place and along where the hoofprints started away . " Well , least this horse got a rider on it now , not like them others , " he says . " Yes , sir , " I says . " So I notice . " He give a scowl at me and honked his nose sideways into a dead bush . " And just what does my prentice happen to notice without me telling him ? " he says . I hunkered down and took a good look at the prints . " The toes go deeper than the rest , instead of it all laying even , " I says . " And how fast was he going ? " he says after a long pause . " Lope or a gallop , " I says . Tracker stood there for a spell , staring at me , and then he says , " I told you that right after I got shot . I told you how fast he was going . " " Yes , sir , " I says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all go in a single line and kicking up scarfs ahead and throwing splays of dirt back . " He kept staring at me , so I says , " Besides , these here prints are further apart than I am tall , so it 's got to be doing something faster'n just walking . " He kept quiet for another spell , then mounted his horse , and I done likewise , feeling uneasy like he was mad at me . " And you really want to be a tracker ? " he says after we 'd started following the prints . " Yes , sir . " " Well , I can see you 're inclined to it , " he says , shaking his head and smiling with the near-half of his mouth . " But there 's nothing much in it but hard work . It never did nothing for me but give me a backache and something to brag about , and you get tired of both of them after about fifty years . "  | " I can get a backache shaking hay , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Then your rewards 'll be few and far between , " he says . And it felt painful to say it , but I had to know what he thought about my weakness that had always felt like some kind of sin to me . " I just like to find things out , " I says . " You and me both , " he says , acting cheered up . " So let 's us go and do it . " After about a half hour of slow going because we had to pick our way across a slope that looked like it 'd been cut into for a road and then give up as a bad job , we trailed the horse to the edge of another gully that was more like a growed-up ravine with a crick at low-water cutting down it . Tracker stopped there at the rim and looked all around . " Whenever you 're not hurrying and you get a good long view like this , just take a little time to soak it in , " he says . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you might save yourself a lot of messing around . Even if you never been here before , you can tell how it 's sposed to look . If a man 's been through a place  --  on foot or horseback , it do n't matter  --  he ai n't going to leave it like he found it . He ca n't help breaking something or knocking something out of line or turning something over or scratching something or losing something or scaring birds or maybe only bendingsomething . And sometimes it 's easier to see them things far off than up close , so just take yourself a good look now because I seen it right off , and if I can see it , so can you . " I scanned over every rock and along the crick on bothp179sides and squinted near and far and tried to make certain sure I was n't missing nothing easy . " Hurry up , " he says . " It 's the last sign we 're likely to get for a while . " I stared around a minute more , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place where the horse went over the bank into the crick and did n't come up the other side . " He grunted and scowled a little . " Mind if I ask how 's come you happened to notice that ? " I pointed along the near edge . " Well , the lip 's straight every place but there , " I says . " It did n't look right . " He sighed and kept looking down into the gulch and did n't say nothing . " What all did I miss ? " I says . " Oh , nothing much , " he says . That made me feel good , so I says , " How 's come we wo n't be getting any more sign ? " " It 's going to rain in about ten minutes , " he says . " Did n't you know that too ? " " No , sir , " I says . " How do you tell a thing like that ? " " Well , I do n't want to burden you with no extra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he says . " That 's all right , " I says . " I can take it . " He give me a narrow look , then says , " See them clouds northwest like a heap of dishrags ? When they show up there , they do n't just stay there . " " I thank you kindly , " I says . He started down the slope and says , " So let 's go water these poor dumb beasts whiles we can do it in comfort . " I followed him . " That horse sure do n't act like it wants to get to Crockville very bad , " I says , trying to figure out what Miz Cherry 'd been up to . " It 's sure taking a long way around . "  | " Maybe he 's got something else to do first , " Tracker says . " Whatever it is , I expect it 'll be revealed in the fullness of time , long as the sun do n't go off the boil or the ocean come back in here to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I says . " The ocean used to be in here a while back , " he says . " What would any ocean want around here ? " I says . " Look at how dry it is . Why , an ocean would n't last five minutes in here but it 'd be sucking dust . " We was down on the level now , and Tracker led the way to the crick , going slow . " I 'm telling you what I know , " he says . " Ai n't that what you wanted ? " " Yes , sir , " I says . " Respeck your elders , " he says . " I do , but I do n't want to make no lifetime job of it , " I says . " I turned prentice so 's I 'd get to be an elder my own self . " " Well , do n't go rushing Nature too fast or she 'll turn around and hook you , " he says . Whiles our horses took a drink , we looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through loose gravel down into the crick . It was easy to see up close , but there was n't nothing on the opposite bank far as we could see upstream nor down . It was only about a foot deep , so she 'd gone wading one way or the other to hide her tracks . Looking at the sky commencing to gloom over , Tracker says , " It may not turn out a real goose-drowner , but it might try . " He dismounted and hung his hat on his saddlehorn . " You might 's well take off that casino shirt and have a free shower bath . It 'll be warmer than the crick . " He started peeling off his raggedy blue denim shirt with the sleeve tore and bloody and the stringy-root poultice looking almost black now.  |p181I  did n't tell him I 'd had two baths yesterday , one apurpose , but just clumb down and untied the apron strings of Mr. Bastion 's shirt and got set for another . It rained enough in ten minutes to last most clouds an hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even when we begun to steam off like the horses . Whiles he was wiping off his saddle with his hat , I says , " What exactly do you spose I 'm aiming to win ? " " How should I know ? " he says . " Well , you and that Left Hand called me He Wants to Win , " I says . " You must of had something in mind . " He did n't mount up but just stood looking both ways along the crick . " Listen , names do n't have to make much sense . Red Shirt do n't have to go around wearing a red shirt all the time , and Crazy Horse was n't crazy , though he had to earn that name from his grandfather to get out of being called Curly all his life . A yellow hide like you would n't understand . " " Who 's a yellow hide ? " I says . " That 's what Arapahoes call whites , " he says . " Same as you 'd say redskin . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hat , but it was too soaked to do much good , so he swung up into his saddle . " And I expect you 'll know what you want to win after you start winning a few things and find out you do n't like them much . " Right then , I was looking at both sides of that Atahata-hina-naand taking a bite at it like Tracy Watkins checking a two-bit piece and feeling uncomfortable . Tracker says , " Well , we got our choice of blind trails , upstream or down . What 'll it be ? " " I do n't spose this here 's Dudley Crick , is it ? " I says . He looked at me puzzled . " That 's right , " he says . " You been up here before ? "  | " No , sir , " I says . " I just heard about it . Which way do you think 's most likely ? " He twisted his hat back in shape and wrang it out some at the same time , then stuck it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't go to ground if it 's got another choice , " he says . " Besides , this is a cold trail now , and if he did any doubling back and bushwhacking , he found out he was n't being followed . Least , not close . No , this is an upstreamer . This is the kind of critter that 'll climb anythinghandy , even if it trees itself and got nothing left but its claws . And right now he 's got a mess of gold on his hands and knows someplace to hide it till it cools down , and that 's where he 's headed , so let 's go up and say hello . " I followed along the firm lip of the crick , feeling a load of admiration for Tracker who 'd worked it all out without me telling him nothing for shortcuts . We 'd gone up the gully about half an hour when Tracker reined in and pointed at a kind of scuffling little trench up our side of the bank . " Maybe , " he says . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a deer coming from upstream a ways . " He started along again , leaning out sideways now and not missing nothing underfoot . After a couple minutes , he says , " There , " and stopped and waited till I 'd come alongside . He was pointing at half a hoofprint with a calked heel like the one we 'd been trailing . It had rainwater in it but had n't melted yet . He grinned for a couple seconds , using both sides of his mouth which he did n't ordinarily do , like he 'd give hisself just about that long to be proud , and no more . We went along about another fifteen minutes whiles the crick turned steeper and begun showing white waterp183and the sides of the gully shortened up , and I says , " If you was going to do some hard-rock mining around here , where would you look first ? " Without turning around , he says , " Well , I 'll tell you . In the first place , I would n't do it at all because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the second place , I would n't do it here because it do n't look like the right kind of rock to me , but in the third place , if I had to do it here , I 'd start rebuilding that flume up there so 's I would n't have to chop and plank too much timber . " I had n't been looking ahead but underfoot , and now as soon as I craned over his shoulder I seen what was left of an old trestle still holding part of a trough a foot and a half wide with one end stuck under a short fall in the crick but broke down and rotted off and the other end going out of sight down over the near side of the gully where it shallowed almost even with the crick bed . Tracker set there looking at it , and then he says , " You know , I got an idea . " " Before we go any further , there 's something I got to tell you , " I says . He went on like he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bank robbers knew where there was an old mine , and he  --  " " Now , wait a minute , " I says . " First thing you got to understand is Miz Cherry probably did n't mean it . I think she was just shooting to scare us off . " " What the hell 're you talking about ? " he says . " Miz Cherry Bastion , " I says . " She owns this mine here wherever that flume goes . " " Why , I have n't seen her since Sam Wiley laid her over his knee for stealing apples and she tried to stick him with an Arkansas toothpick , " he says . " Well , Mr. Bastion give her this mine when it didn'tp184pan out and he struck it over at Cherry Mine , but she 's all right at heart , " I says . " Just ornery . So please do n't go shooting her or nothing . " He looked at me a long time out from under his hatbrimthat was shrinking crooked . " What in the red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So I told him about finding the three riderless horses in her stable and about Mr. Bastion raising cain at the cold collation and about Mother Bastion , and then I showed him the gold ingots that had got bent a little but was probably still worth money . He shook his head after I 'd finished up and says , " Why did n't you tell me sooner ? What 's the matter with you ? " " Well , we come here directly anyway , did n't we ? " I says . " And how am I sposed to learn tracking if I do n't get to see you do it ? " Then I told him about Lud and Sooger , and he says , " Jesus W. Christ , boy , I 'm trying to figure out why you do things , but it 's about as much good as barking at a knot . You could of got us kilt . Why did n't you say nothing ? " " I was scairt you might never be out tracking again so 's I could watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he says . " I might never . " He clicked his tongue at Spud and walked him careful up to the flume , then turned along it over the razorback into the next gully . I followed and says , " I 'm sorry . " " Never mind , " he says over his shoulder . " We 're still kicking . And as long as we 're here , we might 's well see if there 's any gold laying around looking for a home . " The trestles of the flume  --  what was left of them  --  was only holding it about five foot off the ground , and whoever 'd built it had used boulders whenever they was in line with where he was aiming the water . It was dryp185now , of course , and bleached out and the nails rusted and sprung , but a lot of it was still holding up all right . Up ahead I could see where it led over some kind of drop-off . All of a sudden for no reason , Tracker stopped dead still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? " When he did n't answer , I checked it down to a whisper . " What 're you doing now ? " He give me a sour glance and says , " If you see me falling off my horse and blood pouring out of my mouth , chances are I 'm getting kilt . Till that happy hour , would you mind hushing up ? " We set there silent for a minute . Then he dismounted and stuck his ear to the ground , and before I could get off and listen too , he says , " Do n't make sense . Sounds like somebody 's having a gunfight , only it 's underground . "  |p186WE  STAYED OFF of our horses , and when I seen Tracker being extra careful where he put his bootsoles , I done so too . It was like we was afraid of waking somethingup underneath of us , the same as you 'd tiptoe on a roof if you was sneaking in or out at night . Whiles we was fifty foot away from the drop-off , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Bay Boy to a bush before going on in a crouch now and pretty soon on all fours , and just as we come to the rim , Tracker took his hat off like he was ready to pay his respecks to the view , whatever it might be . I did n't have no hat left to take off , but I give my hair a finger-combing just to get in the habit . Then I joined him in taking a nice long look at a new piece of territory ( the way he 'd said you 're sposed to if you 're cutting for sign ) , but there was n't no trouble finding traces of people . They 'd not only passed through but stayed awhile and left a mess . The trestle and trough of the flume went down about a thirty-yard slope ( most of the timbers leaning out of line but only a few missing ) top187a contraption about seven foot tall like a shed with part of the planks missing , and off to the left and past it was a couple of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campfire and two saddles setting on the ground . Off to the right but leading back into the same slope we was laying on was a square mine entrance shored up with timbers , tall enough for a man to walk into if he ducked first . Over the top you could still make out a sign with most of the paint wore off saying Busted Dudley Mine , and out past the bedrolls a newer-looking sign drove on a stake that was harder to read because it was half-slanted away like it was aimed down the dry wash at anybody coming up the regular way saying No Trespassing , SurvivorsWill Be Prosecuted . And the two horses hitched to the last cross-brace of the trestle and looking like they 'd just as soon sleep off this mining business was Lud 's and Sooger 's that they 'd had on the posse , but nobody was in sight . Just then a deep , muffled kind of grunt come out of the mine entrance , not as loud or hard as a splosion , not rumbling but giving a little cough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the rim , smiling , and rolled over on his back and stuck his good arm under his head and crossed his legs like he meant to stay a while . Whispering , I says , " Well , there they are . " I knew Tracker 'd reckonized the horses too since he had an eye like a swapper . " Last evening they was down in Crockvilleand Miz Cherry too , so they must of left the gold up here by itself , and all we 'd had to do was just come by and scoop it up . " Tracker did n't say nothing but just looked at the sky and smiled which was an unusual expression on his face . " What do you spose we should do ? " I says . " We 're doing it right now , " he says , turning aside top188spit some dust and plucking a dead grass-stem to chaw on . It felt funny to of come this far and then not do nothing but lay on our back and memorize clouds . " What 's that exactly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something . " It 's called waiting , " he says . " What for ? " I says . He give me a scowly look but not mad at me yet . " If you 've got something better to do , go do it . Go back to the crick and practice that mouth-harp . " " Ca n't we just walk down to the mine and  --  " But I did n't get much further than that , remembering what he 'd told me about taking people into custody , and now that it was Lud and Sooger on the end of it , I seen what he meant . " You want to get shot for trespassing ? " he says . " No , sir . " " Ever seen a cat by a mouse hole ? " he says . " Yes , sir . " And I had . After a while , you think they been froze to death . " Ever seen a cat go into a mouse hole ? " he says . " No , sir . " " How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over , feeling stupid . " Well , it ai n't big enough for one thing , " I says . " How much room do you think there is in a hard-rock mine for a gunfight ? " he says . " I did n't aim on having no gunfight , " I says . " I do n't even have a gun . " " Was you thinking of asking them out to supper ? " he says . " No , sir . " " Then why do n't you just wait till they come out free ofp189charge on their own two feet ? " he says , handing me a piece of jerky out of his shirt pocket . " Here , play a tune on that , it 's quieter . " So we just laid there a long while , chawing and not talking , and I crawled back for the canteen ( jerky takes a good deal of persuading , and you get dried out with it after a bit , not to mention sick of it ) and generally took a rest which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let alone afternoon . And the longer I laid there , the less reason I could think up for being there at all . I 'd had about as much lesson as I was going to get in tracking ( unless something I could n't think up decided to happen ) , and though I did n't like the idea of Lud and Sooger having that gold ( if that 's where it was ) , I did n't much want Mr. Bastion getting it back neither . I did n't even crave the two bent pieces in my pocket , and if Miz Cherry 'd been there now , I 'd of give them back to her and good riddance if I could of figured how to do it without talking to her or having her see me . In fact I felt like I wanted shut of it all altogether but did n't know how to tell Tracker who acted like he 'd go on waiting by this mouse hole till the turkey vultures begun to get interested in him . We 'd heard a few more of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and finally I says , " What do you spose they 're doing ? " " You had everything else all figured out , " he says . " I expected you 'd have that figured out too . You ever heard any blasting with powder or dynamite ? " " No , sir , " I says . " Except for the bank blowing up . " " Well , then you still have n't , " he says . " That 's a shotgun , unless I got my ears on crooked this morning . " I thought it over a minute . " You mean they 're huntingbirds down a mine hole ? " I says.
