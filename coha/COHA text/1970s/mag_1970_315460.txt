Two weeks ago , Kevin Patrick Moran , 22 , an honors student at the University of California , Santa Barbara , was killed by a bullet as he attempted to put out a fire at the beleaguered Isla Vista branch of Bank of America ( TIME , April 27 ) . It was widely reported that he had been shot by a sniper , while he and other moderate students dealt directly with the attacking radicals . <P> Last week Santa Barbara County Sheriff James Webster reported a different version : as his men began moving into the area around the bank to disperse the students , one cop 's rifle went off accidentally , the bullet ricocheted off the ground and may have killed Moran . To dispel any whitewash charges , Webster promised a televised inquest into the death .
