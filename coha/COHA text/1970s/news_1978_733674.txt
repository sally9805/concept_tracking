txt The Kremlin is using sharper and more defensive language to try to protect its own positions as it faces worsening relations with the United States to the west and China to the east . Yet it gives no sign of recognizing Washington warnings that , unless it changes its ways , the immediate outlook for d  --  tente is even bleaker . Two major human rights trials , expected here this month , can only lead to greater U.S. criticisms of Moscow than the barrage of the last few days , it is believed here . And the latest bugging episode at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow , which has led to an official protest and considerable concern at how far embassy security might have been breached , has served to worsen the Soviet image still further . Until now , strategic arms talks have set the overall mood for d  --  tente with the U.S. , but now U.S. anger at Soviet policies in Af *Please turn to Page 34 From page 1 Brezhnev talks tough but d  --  tente still lives rica , on human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on strategic arms . The Soviets still say they very much want a strategic arms treaty . Special correspondent Eric Bourne reports from Vienna that Soviet President Leonid Brezhnev evidently welcomed the coincidence of his recent Prague visit with the NATO summit in order to give Washington a signal that he still is intent on d  --  tente regardless of upsets , however acrimonious , elsewhere . The Soviet line now is , as Foreign . Minister Andrei Gromyko told Soviet viewers in an hour-long television interview late May 30 , that President Carter is not defending the talks strongly enough against American critics . Mr. Carter was not " creating a favorable atmosphere for the talks , " Mr. Gromyko said , but there was no mention of any Soviet changes in Africa or on human rights . Mr. Gromyko also said in Washington that the President 's information on Zaire was simply incorrect ? a charge the administration quickly disputed . In a carefully orchestrated press campaign in recent days , the Kremlin has : 1 . Repeatedly denied it or Havana had anything to do with the rebel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force for Zaire as " collective colonialism . " 2 . Accused the U.S. and NATO of deliberately trying to blame Moscow and Havana while knowing , so Moscow says , that this was wrong . 3 . Leveled charges of " hypocrysy " and " falsity " ( Pravda June 4 ) against Washington for making mere " formal curtsies " to the UN General Assembly session on disarmament while plotting a big NATO arms boost in Washington . 4 . Told its own people that U.S. public opinion polls show that most Americans want disarmament and strategic arms limits . 5 . Asked who in Washington opposes more detente . By saying the " Washington Line " on NATO arms is a serious threat to d  --  tente , " Pravda June 4 seemed to be blaming Mr. Carter , though it stopped short of actually saying so . The previous day Pravda had used the device of reprinting an article from the main Havana newspaper " Granma " to suggest that " elements of some standing " in Washington supported joint action with China that " seriously " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that China was joining in what Pravda June 3 called an " unholy alliance " with NATO and with South Africa by sending Foreign Minister Huang Hua to Zaire . In public at least , the Soviets blandly insist that Washington is to blame for all the troubles of recent weeks . Grim mood on rights tin human ngnts , me mooa nere is grim . Dissidents who have waited for years to be let out of the country have seen a lengthy crackdown instead . The trial of Nobel Peace Prize winner Anatoly Shcharansky , a dissident leader , is due later this month . U.S. Jewish opinion has made it the biggest case now dividing Moscow and Washington ? and President Carter himself has publicly defended Shcharansky , a Jewsih computer expert , against Soviet press chargeg of spying . The mere fact of a trial will provoke demonstrations and an outcry in Washington , it is predicted . A close associate of Alexander Solzhenitsyn .

But it is always , possible that Moscow will ignore Mr. Caiter and " throw the book " at both men . The bugging of the U.S. Embassy in Moscow was revealed at a particularly embarrassing time for the Soviets . Bugging of embassies is considered routine for both sides . Efforts are thought to go on virtually all the time . But the latest disclosure came in a week when both sides had engaged in public name-calling on a variety of issues . And the spectacular nature of the reports added to the drama of the event . The U.S. State Department was forced to speak out when the Moscow correspondent of the Los Angeles Times learned of the listening device in the chimney of the Embassy 's south wing . Further revelations of an underground tunnel leading to a listening post in an adjoining Soviet apartment house , and of Americans crawling into the post and surprising a Russian there , added to the effect .
