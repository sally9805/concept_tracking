The frustrating feeling shared by many Americans that their incomes are going up but their spending power is slipping got some additional statistical support last week . Take-home pay rose briskly in August , the Labor Department reported , and the average production worker with three dependents pocketed precisely $182.49 , up 5.1% from a year ago . But inflation has made a mockery of the increase , and in fact Mr. Average is 2.5% poorer than he was last year and near ly 4.5% poorer than in 1972 . Back then , his take-home pay of $121.68 was worth $96.80 in 1967 dollars . In those terms , the buying power of the pay he pocketed in August 1978 was only $92.45 . <P> The pay erosion has set back consumer confidence . A poll taken this summer by the Conference Board shows that 23% of U.S. families surveyed feel their living standard fell during the past year , forcing a clampdown on buying . Only 20% reported an increase in their standard of living , vs. 31% last spring . The latest consumer price index offered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to an annual rate of 7.4% , vs. a yearly rate of 11.4% in June and 62% in July . Food prices , which had been falling earlier in the summer , picked up slightly in August , but it was mainly increases in other areas that sent the index up . The Carter Administration has finally settled on a forecast of 8% inflation for all this year , and most economists tend to agree with that pessimistic view .
