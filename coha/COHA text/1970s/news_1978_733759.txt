txt President Carter tweaked the Russian bear by blocking sale of an advanced computer to the Soviet news agency ? but United States leverage over the Soviets has narrowed sharply in recent years . Leaders in the U.S.S.R. are keenly interested in American computers , oil field equipment , tiny integrated circuits , and aerospace technology . But in many areas once dominated by the U.S. , the Soviets can obtain advanced technology from other Western nations , or have progressed rapidly on their own . The White House , responding to hardened U.S.-Soviet relations , also ordered that future sales of oil equipment and technology to the Russians be monitored by the National Security Council . The toughened stance , quickly praised by such administration critics as Sen. Henry Jackson ( D ) of Washington and Sen. Robert Dole ( R ) of Kansas , , also drew some complaints . " It wo n't do anything to make the Soviets change their own internal system , " observed one expert on East-West trade . " We tried this sort of thing in the 1950s and 1960s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The White House was under obvious pressure to take some action in the wake of the dissident trials in the Soviet Union , as well as the fining of two U.S. newsmen in Moscow on charges of slander . White House press secretary Jody Powell steered reporters away from calling some of the moves strictly anti-Soviet . Inclusion of oil equipment on a special list of commodities needing White House approval " gives greater flexibility " to the President , Mr. Powell noted . That was the main purpose of the latest action , rather than " to encourage confrontation , " he said . A moderating influence on White House response has been a desire to avoid " cutting off our nose " in an attempt to respond to Soviet actions , administration sources say . // From page 1 U.S. leverage Mr. Powell noted that even though some actions appear to hurt the Soviet Union ? and do . little to the U.S. ? in the short run , the longterm impact could be just as serious on the U.S. as on the U.S.S.R. This is particularly true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year and a half . U.S. firms have contracted for more than $500 million in new oil equipment for the Soviets . This includes a $144 million deal with Dresser Industries of Dallas for a plant to make high-quality oil-drilling bits . The Dresser contract could be blocked under the get-tough stance by the White House . But it may well go through . Mr. Powell indicates no final decision has been made . The primary reason for eventual approval , if it comes about , would be that increased Soviet oil production would add to total world supplies . That could help to head off a worldwide petroleum squeeze predicted for the mid-1980s in a study last year by the Central Intelligence Agency . Even if that CIA study'is too gloomy , as critics contend , oil analysts observe that plentiful Soviet oil sloshing through the pipelines of Europe will help to moderate the prices demanded by the oil cartel centered in the Middle East . The computer sale , involving a powerful Sperry Univac model that the Soviets said would have been used by the Tass news agency in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggests that the $6.8 million computer was more sophisticated than Tass really needed . Trade experts note that obtaining such an advanced U.S. computer would have been technologically useful to the Soviets , who are running about 10 years behind America in this field . Europe and Japan have nothing to offer that matches the Univac . Fifteen years ago , analysts note , there was a mammoth list of high-technology items that the U.S. could withhold from the Soviets , but the list has shortened substantially as America 's lead in many fields has narrowed . Even so , a get-tough stance will hurt the Soviet Union , a specialist says , " even though you 'll see the Soviets publicly deny that it has any impact . " America 's largest trade with the U.S.S.R. actually lies outside the field of technology and centers on America 's bountiful fields of corn , wheat . and soybeans . While U.S. exports of manufactured goods in the first four months of this year totaled $129 million , trade in agricultural commodities was a whopping $750 million .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
