txt Every weekday morning George ( Jug ) Shoaf rises early , eats breakfast , and leaves for work like any other California commuter . But he does n't commute with a car , a train , a bus , a bicycle , a truck , or a motorcycle , and he does n't jog . He flies a Bellanca Citabria between the San Jose and Oakland Airports , a free and easy distance of about 40 miles as the Citabria flies A Bellanca Citabria is a small private plane and Mr. Shoaf is one of hundreds of Californians who fly their own planes on a daily or semidaily commute basis in a state that leads the nation in total airplane traffic , commercial and noncommercial . Of the top 10 traffic-producing airports in the United States , 4 are in California Of the top 20 airports , 9 are scattered about in California from San Diego to Eureka . And only a small percent of the total takeoffs and landings are by scheduled airlines . The majority is private use . " I fly strictly for convenience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who operates Flightways Sport Aviation . " Maybe at rush hours on Friday evenings I gain a little time over a car , but I fly because it 's less strain than driving . " Unlike most private-airplane commuters , Mr. Shoaf has the advantage of flying from one airport to another across San Francisco Bay for his job . Other airplane commuters may have short bus or car rides added to each end of their commutes , but they still gain time where they would otherwise be slowed by freeway traffic or distances too long to drive daily . The use of private planes for commuting has grown because of California 's good weather , the state 's long north-to-south distances , the population growth , and the subsequent growth of airports . // *Commuters in sky : Californians ' hop ' // There are a staggering 800 airports in he state ranging from dirt strips in rural areas to the sprawling Van Nuys Airport , , k here 850 private planes rent space and make it the No. 1 noncommercial airport in the United States Weekday pace picks up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in northern California , said there are very few commuters anywhere who use their planes for trips of less than 100 miles " But there is almost as much weekly traffic now as there is on the weekend , " he said Most commuters are businessmen with flexible hours  --  real-estate developers , builders , electricians , a few farmers  --  who own their own , companies , and utilize planes for business purposes and the resulting tax advantages . At Van Nuys Airport two insurance companies have offices at the airport . Both make extensive use of private planes . Also at Van Nuys , a hospital supply salesman uses his plane almost daily . At the Palo Alto Airport near San Francisco a businessman selling his own healthfood juicer uses his plane three or four times a week . Foursome in a pool In Los Angeles County a telephone company executive formed a " plane pool " that flies four men from Claremont ' - to Santa Monica every day . Normally the trip would be an hour and 15 minutes on the freeway . By plane it 's 40 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The rest is on the ground going to and from airports at either end . Mr. Shoaf 's Bellanca Citabria is a two-engine plane capable of 125 m.p.h. and designed for acrobatics . " Maybe 30 days out of the year the weather will force me to drive , " he said . Mr. Shoaf has been flying for about three years and says he pays about $125 a year in taxes and registration fees on the plane . He says the American-made plane averages about 15 miles to the gallon in flight . Sky crowding denied Like most pilots enamored with flying , Mr. Shoaf says , " Frankly , the most dangerous part of the trip is driving the car to the airport . I 'll bet I do n't see three or four planes in the 40-mile trip . All this talk about the crowded skies is just not true . " If it is n't crowded in the sky , it does get a little crowded on the ground . Robert T. Dougherty , an aviation consultant for the state , said that in addition to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are 177 heliports and 10 seaplane ports " And two state colleges maintain fields , " he added . What this means , aside from a lot of airports , is a kind of soaring bureacracy for private-plane owners , not only in California but around the nation . Taxes weigh heavily on California planes , to the tune of nearly $4 million a year in county and city levies in addition to fuel taxes , weight taxes , federal taxes , plus a thorough annual inspection by federal authorities . " With the economic squeeze , a lot of private owners are staying on the ground , " said Mr. Dougherty . Small firms watched " One of our big problems , " said Mr. Scott , manager of Buchanan Field , " is watching and regulating the conduct of small airplane companies and distributors . Some people are n't able to run an airplane business successfully and we have to ferret out those not able to maintain financial stability . " The longest California commute on record has to be State Assemblyman David C. Pierson 's daily trek by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his home in Inglewood in southern California to his office in the State Capitol in Sacramento . The round trip costs only $6 more than the $30 a day he is allowed for expenses , and he insists that the trip takes no longer than driving from the San Fernando Valley to downtown Los Angeles in rush hour  --  1 hour and 40 minutes .
