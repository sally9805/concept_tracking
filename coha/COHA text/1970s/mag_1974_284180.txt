THE PRESIDENCY <P> We are passing through the longest and bitterest political struggle that our nation has had in 100 years . Families have been split , old friendships shattered , careers ruined , public men disgraced , and great quantities of hate pumped into the American system . <P> And yet beneath it all , something special endures , some sense of common purpose held by Republicans and Democrats , liberals and conservatives , ins and outs , accused and accusers .

But last week there was a quiet interlude in Washington that reminded us that we are , after all , going the same way . <P> It began as a somber occasion-the memorial service for Columnist Stewart Alsop , a civilized man who succumbed to leukemia after waging an inspiring fight with his will , his wit and his body ( see THE PRESS ) . <P> The White House men walked across Lafayette Park to St. John 's Church , the small , stately structure that has welcomed Presidents and their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a Nixon speechwriter , his wife , and Richard Moore , presidential friend and assistant , were there .

" They all rose and sang with remarkable force a 19th century hymn : " I fear no foe , with thee at hand to bless ; / Ills have no weight , and tears no bitterness . " The church was not really sad just then-the significance of the moment to the men and women there went beyond grief . Hate died . As the service ended , there seemed to be almost a conscious effort by adversaries to seek each other out and say a kind word .
