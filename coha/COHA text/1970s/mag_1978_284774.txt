Jessie Small sits in the front seat of his Chevy pickup truck chomping on an unlit Roi-Tan cigar and directing his three combines as they complete the cutting of a wheatfield about 15 miles outside the town of Circle , Mont . Jessie seldom bothers to light his cigars ; mostly he just chews on them , discarding the soggy end , piece by piece , until there 's nothing left . The radio linking him with his combines crackles : " Which way do we go ? I ca n't find the new area ? " <P> It is well after sunset . Some blue remains in the darkened Western sky . Jessie can see only the lights of his combines , as one by one they disappear over a hill . " Follow that star , " drawls Jessie over the radio . The combines , like tanks on night maneuvers , head west , following Venus , which is low and bright in the sky . " We 've got it ! " Gary Coleman , driver of the lead combine yells back . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a rich wave of uncut field . <P> During the harvest on the Great Plains , it is not unusual to cut at night . A few days ' delay in cutting ready wheat makes little difference to the wheat ; it is the weather that can be the problem . Summer storms often send huge hailstones , smashing car windshields , denting tin roofs , flattening wheatfields . They are so common that once a farmer 's wheat is ready , he wants it harvested . And tonight is a whole lot better than tomorrow . <P> In daylight the combines of Jessie Small 's command look like green and yellow robots roaming through the wheat . When they start rolling down the length of a 60-acre section , it seems as if they will just keep right on going . Never stopping . Never turning aside . A 24-ft. - wide reel spins languidly in front of each combine , like a big lawnmower in slow motion , nudging the pale stalks of wheat gently into the path of unseen cutting blades . <P> From the driver 's seat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 19,000-lb. , 150-h.p . John Deere 7700 combine , even run at half throttle . The engines hiss and suck . The cutting blades click like a madwoman 's knitting needles . In this age , when transistors perform wondrous deeds with assistance from only a few volts of electricity , the combine , despite its air conditioner , turbo engine and two-way radio , is a functioning monument to 19th century mechanical ingenuity . It is a jumble of rubber belts propelling multisized wheels that turn gears , pull pulleys and rotate augers . The object of all this clever instrumentation is not only the cutting of wheat , which the combine does admirably by snipping it off a few inches from the ground , but the threshing of wheat . As the great machines inch their way across the field , a cloud of chaff blows back behind them . Only the cleanly hulled grain remains . <P> These days , few individual farmers can afford to own their own combines . The price is edging up to $50,000 . Besides , in wheat country , combines are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farmers turn to combine cutters , also jeeringly known as " wheaties , " who hire themselves out , along with their families and their combines . Small is a custom cutter , one of several thousand men who begin their summer combine run in mid-May , cutting down in Texas , and then follow the rhythm of the ripening wheat up through Oklahoma , Nebraska , Kansas , the Dakotas and Montana .
