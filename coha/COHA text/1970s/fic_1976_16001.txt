TRAVIS BICKLE TRAVIS BICKLE , aged twenty-six , lean , hard , the consummate loner . On the surface he appears good-looking , even handsome ; he has a quiet steady look and a disarming smile which flashes from nowhere , lighting up his whole face . But behind that smile , around his dark eyes , in his gaunt cheeks , one can see the ominous strains caused by a life of private fear , emptiness and loneliness . He seems to have wandered in from a land where it is always cold , a country where the inhabitants seldom speak . The head moves , the expression changes , but the eyes remain ever-fixed , unblinking , piercing empty space . TRAVIS is now drifting in and out of the New York City night life , a dark shadow among darker shadows . Not noticed , with no reason to be noticed , TRAVIS is one with his surroundings . He wears rider jeans , cowboy boots , a plaid western shirt and a worn beige Army jacket with a patch reading King Kong Company , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : sick sex , repressed sex , lonely sex , but sex none the less . He is a raw male force , driving forward ; towards what , one can not tell . Then one looks closer and sees the inevitable . The clock spring can not be wound continually tighter . As the earth moves towards the sun , TRAVIS BICKLE moves towards violence . TRAVIS GETS A JOB Film opens on exterior of Manhattan cab garage . Weather-beaten sign above driveway reads , Taxi Enter Here . Yellow cabs scuttle in and out . It is winter , snow is piled on the kerbs , the wind is howling .

We cut in to ongoing conversation between the middle-aged PERSONNEL OFFICER and a young man standing in front of his desk . The young man is TRAVIS BICKLE . He wears his jeans , boots and Army jacket . He takes a drag of his unfiltered cigarette . The PERSONNEL OFFICER is exhausted : he arrives at work  --  4  --  exhausted .

( Credits appear over scenes from Manhattan nightlife . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rainy , slick , wet , miserable night in Manhattan 's theatre district . Cabs and umbrellas are congested everywhere ; well-dressed pedestrians are pushing , running , waving down taxis . The high-class theatre patrons crowding out of the midtown shows are shocked to find that the same rain that falls on the poor and common is also falling on them . The unremitting sounds of honking and shouting play against the dull pitter-patter of rain . The glare of yellow , red and green lights reflects off the pavements and autos . When it rains , the boss of the City is the taxi-driver  --  so goes the cabbies ' maxim , proved true by this particular night 's activity . Only the taxis seem to rise above the situation : they glide effortlessly through the rain and traffic , picking up whom they choose , spurning whom they choose , going where they please . Further uptown , the crowds are neither so frantic nor so glittering . The rain also falls on the street burns and the aged poor . Junkies still stand around on rainy street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taxis service them too .

The credits end . ) Section Details WE MEET TRAVIS WE MEET TRAVIS Travis 's yellow taxi pulls up in the foreground . On left rear door are lettered the words Dependable Taxi Service . We are somewhere in the upper fifties on Fifth Avenue . The rain has not let up . An elderly woman climbs in the right rear door , crushing her umbrella . TRAVIS waits a moment , then pulls away from the kerb with a start . Later , we see Travis 's taxi speeding down the rain-slicked avenue . The action is periodically accompanied by TRAVIS 's narration . He is reading from a haphazard personal diary . &nbsp; TRAVIS ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thank God for the rain which has helped wash the garbage and trash off the sidewalks .

Some of the writing is in pencil , some in ink . The handwriting is jagged . Camera continues to pan , examining Travis 's apartment . It is unusual , to say the least . A ratty old mattress is thrown against one wall . The floor is littered with old newspapers , worn and unfolded street maps and pornography . The pornography is of the sort that looks cheap but costs $10 a throw  --  black and white photos of naked women tied and gagged with black leather straps and clotheslines .

The theatre , a blaze of cheap Day-Glo reds and yellows , is an offence to the clear , crisp morning air . The permanent lettering reads , Adam Theater. 16 mm Sound Features . Underneath , today 's features are hand-lettered : Six-Day Cruise and Beaver Dam . TRAVIS stops at the box office , purchases a ticket , and walks in . ) ( Porno theatre . Inside the porno theatre , TRAVIS stands in the aisle for a moment . He turns round , walking back towards the concession stand .

Section Details WE MEET BETSY WE MEET BETSY Exterior of Charles Palantine campaign headquarters . The headquarters of the New Yorkers for Charles Palantine for President Committee , located at the corner of 58th Street and Broadway , are festooned in traditional red , white and blue banners , ribbons and signs . One large sign proclaims Palantine . Another sign reads Register for New York Primary , July 20 . The smiling middle-aged face of Charles Palantine keeps watch over the bustling pedestrians . It is late afternoon . Inside headquarters , a variety of young workers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The room is pierced with the sound of ringing phones . Seen from a distance  --  the only way TRAVIS can see them  --  these are America 's chosen youth : healthy , energetic , well-groomed , attractive , all recruited from the bucolic fields of Massachusetts and Connecticut . The camera favours BETSY , about twenty-five , an extremely attractive woman sitting at the reception desk between two phones and several stacks of papers . Her attractions , however , are more than skin deep . Beneath that Cover Girl facial there is a keen , though highly specialized , sensibility : her eyes scan every man who passes her desk as her mind computes his desirability : political , intellectual , sexual , emotional , material . Simple pose and status do not impress her ; she seeks out the extraordinary qualities in men . She is , in other words , a star-fucker of the highest order . BETSY , putting down the phone , calls TOM , a lanky , amiable and modishly long-haired campaign worker , over to her desk . &nbsp; BETSYTom . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  12  --  qualities which interest BETSY . He gets nowhere with BETSY  --  yet he keeps trying . Just another of those routine office flirtations which pass the hours and free the fantasies . ) &nbsp; BETSYTom , come here a moment . ( He walks over . ) I think this canvas report is about ready to go out . Check it out with Andy , and if he okays it , have a copy made for the campaign headquarters in every county . ( Pause . ) And do n't forget to add the new photo releases . &nbsp; TOMThe senator 's White Paper is almost ready , Bets . Should we wait for that ? &nbsp; BETSYAndy usually just sends those to the national media . The local press does n't know what to do with a position paper until UPI and AP tell them anyway . &nbsp; TOMI think we should try to get maximum coverage for this new mandatory welfare programme . Push the issue . &nbsp; BETSY ( As if instructing a child ) First push the man , then the issue . Senator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intelligent , interesting , fascinating man . &nbsp; TOMYou forgot sexy . &nbsp; BETSYNo , I did n't forget sexy . &nbsp; TOMJust did n't get around to it , huh ? &nbsp; BETSYOh , Tom , please . &nbsp; TOMWell , for Christsakes , you sound like you 're selling . . .

Not the news , not the issues , the man . If Walter Cronkite told people to eat soap , they 'd do it . We are selling cars , goddamn it . ( BETSY 's attention is being distracted by something she sees across the street . She puts on her glasses and looks out across the street again . ) &nbsp; TOMWell , if Cronkite 's so great , why do n't we run him instead ? &nbsp; BETSYThat 's the last . The finish . Period . Some people can learn . Some people ca n't . And you wonder why we never get serious  --  &nbsp; TOMSure we could run him .

The one that 's been sitting there . &nbsp; TOMHow long has he been there ? &nbsp; BETSYI do n't know  --  but it feels like a long time . ( TRAVIS 's cold , piercing eyes stare out from his cab , parked across the street from the Palantine headquarters . He is like a lone wolf watching the warm camp fires of civilization from a distance . A thin red dot glows from his cigarette . TOM exchanges TRAVIS 's gaze . ) &nbsp; TOM ( Determined ) Well , I 'll go out and ask him . ( As TOM walks towards the front door , BETSY 's eyes alternate between him and the position where TRAVIS sits . TOM strides out the front door and walks briskly out of the Palantine headquarters , across the street towards Travis 's taxi . TRAVIS spots TOM walking towards him and quickly starts up his cab , then squeals off in a burst of billowing exhaust . TOM watches the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) &nbsp; pp. 14-26 FURTHER THOUGHTS FURTHER THOUGHTS Inside Travis 's apartment . TRAVIS lies on his mattress , staring at the ceiling . He is fully clothed and appears deep in thought . Near his mattress rest several medications : a large bottle of vitamin pills , two smaller bottles of pills , a bottle of peach-flavoured brandy . &nbsp; TRAVIS ( Voice over ) All my life needed was a sense of direction , a sense of someplace to go . I do not believe one should devote his life to morbid self-attention , but should become a person like other people . ( Another day . Late afternoon . Travis 's taxi is driving down Broadway with the Off Duty sign on . Tracking shot down Broadway . Camera stops at Palantine campaign headquarters . A few workers remain in the office . Betsy 's desk is vacant . ) ( Fifth Avenue . The same afternoon . Camera tracks with crowded mass of Manhattanites as they ooze through the sidewalks towards their various destinations . Individuals are indiscernible : it is simply a congested mass . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Broadway . She was wearing a yellow dress , answering the phone at her desk . ( Suddenly : out of the congested human mass , in slowing motion , appears the slender figure of BETSY , in a stylish yellow dress . The crowd parts like the Red Sea , and there she is : walking all alone , untouched by the crowd , suspended in space and time . ) She appeared like an angel out of this open sewer . Out of this filthy mass . She is alone : they can not touch her . ( Inside Travis 's apartment . TRAVIS is at the table , writing in his diary . Close-up : his stubby pencil rests on the word her . ) Section Details SMALL TALK IN A GREASY SPOON SMALL TALK IN A GREASY SPOON It is 3.30 in the morning in a bacon-shaped all-night West Side restaurant . The thick smell hangs in the air  --  fried grease , smoke , sweat , regurgitated wine .  --  15  --  Whatever does n't flush away in New York at night turns up in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grill . A junkie shuffles from one side of the door to another . Slouched over the small four-person formica tables are several well-dressed blacks ( too well-dressed for this time and place ) , a cluster of street people and a lost old coot who hangs on to his cup of coffee as if it were his last possession . The restaurant , brightly lit , perfectly conveys the image of urban plasticity  --  without the slightest hint of an accompanying cleanliness . Toward the rear of the restaurant sit three cabbies : WIZARD , a worn man of about fifty , DOUGH-BOY , younger family man , CHARLIE T , fortyish , black . WIZARD is telling DOUGH-BOY a story . CHARLIE T , his elbows propped against the table top , is not listening . He stares silently down at a plate of cold scrambled eggs and a Racing Forum . His eyes may not be open . &nbsp; WIZARDFirst she did her make-up . You know , I hate it when they do that . I mean she does the whole works , the mascara , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . &nbsp; DOUGH-BOYNot rouge . Blush-On , they call it . &nbsp; WIZARDThe kind with a brush ? ( TRAVIS appears at the door . He has to push aside the junkie in order to enter , without making physical contact  --  something TRAVIS would not relish . He may be repulsed with these people and this place , but he is too much a part of this to let his feelings rise to the surface . WIZARD gives TRAVIS a perfunctory wave . ) &nbsp; WIZARDTravis . &nbsp; TRAVISHey Wizard . ( TRAVIS straddles a seat at the table . DOUGH-BOY gives TRAVIS something between a wink and an eye-twitch and says : ) &nbsp; DOUGH-BOYYeah , that 's Blush-On . My wife uses it . &nbsp; WIZARD ( Ironic ) Ask Travis . He 's the ladies ' man . ( TRAVIS shrugs and motions for a cup of coffee . ) Well , whatever the fuck it is , she used it . And then the spray perfume .

But it was pretty obvious what she was doing .

TRAVIS indicates he knows DOUGH-BOY . ) &nbsp; DOUGH-BOYYeah . We went to Harvard together . ( Laughs . ) &nbsp; WIZARDWe call him Dough-Boy cause he likes the dollars . He 'll chase a buck straight into Jersey . &nbsp; DOUGH-BOYLook who 's talking ? ( Gestures around table . ) Who else would stay up all night to catch the morning rush hour ?

( TRAVIS 's eyes turn towards the restaurant 's other patrons . There are three street people sitting at a table . One guy , stoned , stares straight ahead . A raggedly attractive girl rests her head on the shoulder of the other , a heavily bearded young man with a headband . They kiss and tease each other , momentarily lost in their separate world . TRAVIS watches the hippie couple closely , his feelings sharply divided between cultural contempt and morose jealousy . Why should these people enjoy the love and intimacy that has always eluded him ? He must enjoy these schizoid emotions , because his eyes dwell on the couple . ) &nbsp; DOUGH-BOY ( Out of shot , changing the subject ) You run all over town , do n't you , Travis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Mau Mau land , that 's what it is .

You need one ? &nbsp; TRAVISNah . ( Pause . ) I suppose not .

Lotsa shit around . &nbsp; WIZARDThe cops and company raise hell if they find out .

I first noticed when  --  &nbsp; TOMIs he Italian ? &nbsp; BETSYNo , why ? &nbsp; TOMYou sure he 's not Italian ? &nbsp; BETSYHe 's black , OK ? &nbsp; TOMWell , if he had been Italian , they could have been shot off . Sometimes the mob does that to teach guys a lesson . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &nbsp; BETSYAs I said , he is n't Italian . Besides , I thought they just killed them . &nbsp; TOMDo n't be nave . They ca n't kill everybody . They have different punishments for different things . Like , if they kill a stool pigeon , they leave a canary on the body . It 's symbolic . &nbsp; BETSYWhy do n't they leave a pigeon instead of a canary ? &nbsp; TOMI do n't know . Maybe they do n't leave a canary . Do n't be technical . What I 'm saying is if this news-stand guy 's Italian and his fingers are gone , maybe he 's a thief . &nbsp; BETSYFirst , he 's not Italian . Second , he 's not a thief . I noticed the fingers when he was getting my change  --  the right change . Two of his fingers are missing . Just stubs . Like they were blown away . I was putting my change in my purse when I saw him get out a cigarette . I could n't help watching . I was dying to see how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , right ? &nbsp; BETSYNo , stupid . With the stubs . That 's the whole point . &nbsp; TOMI know that guy . His hand looks like a paw . An old black guy , the news-stand at  --   --  20  --  &nbsp; BETSYNo , this is young  --  well , I 'm never sure how old black people are  --  but , anyway , he is n't old . That 's for sure . &nbsp; TOMShow me how he did that again . ( Across the street from the headquarters . TRAVIS is striding briskly across Broadway towards the Palantine headquarters . He is dressed the best we have seen him : his trousers ( not jeans ) are pressed , his boots shined , his hair combed . Under his Army jacket he wears a freshly laundered shirt and Ivy League tie . He drops his cigarette , steps on it and walks in . Watching TRAVIS enter Palantine 's headquarters , we are again surprised to realize that TRAVIS is really quite attractive . His deformities are psychological , not physical . He believes he is cursed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the office , and heads towards Betsy 's desk . TOM walks over to greet him , but TRAVIS ignores him . ) &nbsp; TRAVIS ( At Betsy 's desk ) I want to volunteer . ( As the camera examines TRAVIS 's face more closely , one can see the hollowness wrought by lack of sleep and an insufficient diet . ) &nbsp; TOM ( Interrupting ) If you 'll come this way . ( TRAVIS elbows TOM off . ) &nbsp; TRAVIS ( To BETSY ) No . I want to volunteer to you . &nbsp; TOM ( Under his voice ) Bets . ( BETSY waves TOM off with a short gesture , indicating everything is OK . He walks away . ) &nbsp; BETSY ( Curious ) And why is that ? ( TRAVIS is on his best behaviour . He smiles slightly . ) &nbsp; TRAVISBecause you are the most beautiful woman I have ever seen . ( BETSY is momentarily taken back , but pleased . TRAVIS 's presence has a definite sexual charge . He has those star qualities BETSY looks for : she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stands before her . And then , too , there is that disarming smile . He is , as BETSY would say , fascinating . ) &nbsp; BETSY ( Smiling ) Is that so ? ( Pause . ) But what do you think of Charles Palantine ? &nbsp; TRAVIS ( His mind elsewhere ) Who , Ma'am ?  --  21  --  &nbsp; BETSYCharles Palantine . The man you want to volunteer to help elect President . &nbsp; TRAVISOh , I think he 's a wonderful man . Make a great , great President . &nbsp; BETSYYou want to canvass ? &nbsp; TRAVISYes , Ma'am . ( BETSY is interviewing TRAVIS , but she is also teasing him a little , leading him on in a gentle feminine way . ) &nbsp; BETSYHow do you feel about Senator Palantine 's stand on welfare ? ( This takes TRAVIS back a bit . He obviously does n't have the slightest idea what Palantine 's stand on welfare is ; in fact , he does n't have any ideas about politics whatsoever . TRAVIS thinks a moment , then improvises an answer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's right . People should work for a living . I do . Every day . I like to work . Get those old coots off welfare and make ' em work for a change . ( BETSY does a subtle double-take : this is n't exactly Palantine 's position on welfare . She remains intrigued by TRAVIS . ) &nbsp; BETSYWell , that 's not exactly what the Senator has proposed . You might not want to canvass , but there is plenty of other work we need done : office work , filing , poster hanging . &nbsp; TRAVISI 'm a good worker , Betsy Ma'am , a real good worker . &nbsp; BETSY ( Gesturing ) If you talk to Tom , he 'll assign you to something . &nbsp; TRAVISIf you do n't mind , Ma'am , I 'd rather work for you . &nbsp; BETSYWell , we 're all working tonight . &nbsp; TRAVISWell , Betsy Ma'am , I drive a taxi at night . &nbsp; BETSYWell , then , what is it you exactly want to do ? &nbsp; TRAVIS ( Bolstering courage ) If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mighty pleased if you 'd go out and have some coffee and pie with me . ( BETSY does n't quite know what to make of TRAVIS . She is curious , intrigued , tantalized . Like a moth , she draws closer to the flame . ) &nbsp; BETSYWhy ? &nbsp; TRAVISWell , Betsy Ma'am , I drive by this place here in my taxi many times a day . And I watch you sitting here at this big long desk with these telephones , and I say to myself ,  --  22  --  that 's a lonely girl . She needs a friend . And I 'm gon na be her friend . ( Smiles . ) ( TRAVIS rarely smiles , but when he does his whole face glows . It is as if he is able to tap an inner reserve of charm unknown even to himself . BETSY is completely disarmed . ) &nbsp; BETSYI do n't know . . . &nbsp; TRAVISIt 's just to the corner , Ma'am . In broad daytime . Nothing can happen . I 'll be there to protect you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All right . I 'm taking a break at four o'clock . If you 're here then we 'll go to the corner and have some coffee and pie . &nbsp; TRAVISOh , I appreciate that , Betsy Ma'am . I 'll be here at four o'clock exactly . ( Pause . ) And . . . ah . . . Betsy . . . &nbsp; BETSYYes ? &nbsp; TRAVISMy name is Travis . &nbsp; BETSYThank you , Travis . ( TRAVIS nods , turns and exits . TOM , who has been watching this interchange with a pseudostandoffish ( actually jealous ) air , steps over to BETSY . His manner demands some sort of explanation of what she was doing . BETSY simply shrugs  --  it 's really none of his business . ) &nbsp; BETSYI 'm just going to find out what the cabbies are thinking . Section Details COFFEE-SHOP RENDEZVOUS COFFEE-SHOP RENDEZVOUS TRAVIS is pacing back and forth on Broadway just beyond the Palantine headquarters . He checks his watch . &nbsp; TRAVIS ( Voice over ) April 26 , 1972 . Four o'clock p.m . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . ( TRAVIS and BETSY are sitting in a booth of a small New York coffee shop . They have both been served coffee ; TRAVIS is nervously turning his cup around in his hands . The waitress brings their orders : apple pie for TRAVIS , fruit compote for BETSY . ) I had black coffee and apple pie with a slice of melted yellow cheese . I think that was a good selection . Betsy had coffee and a fruit salad dish . She could have had anything she wanted . ( BETSY 's conversation interrupts TRAVIS. )  --  23  --  &nbsp; BETSYWe 've signed up 15,000 Palantine volunteers in New York so far . The organizational problems are becoming just staggering . &nbsp; TRAVISI know what you mean . I 've got the same problems . I just ca n't get things organized . Little things , I mean . Like my room , my possessions . I should get one of those signs that says , One of These Days I 'm Gon na Get Organezizied. ( TRAVIS contorts his mouth to match his mispronunciation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grin . The very sight of it makes one 's heart pound .  --  24  --  BETSY can not help but be caught up in TRAVIS 's grin . TRAVIS 's contagious , quicksilver moods cause her to say : ) &nbsp; BETSY ( Laughing ) Travis , I never ever met anybody like you before . &nbsp; TRAVISI can believe that . &nbsp; BETSYWhere do you live ? &nbsp; TRAVIS ( Evasive ) Oh , uptown . You know . Some joint . It ai n't much . &nbsp; BETSYSo why did you decide to drive a taxi at night ? &nbsp; TRAVISI had a regular job for a while , days . You know , doin ' this , doin ' that . But I did n't have anything to do at night . I got kinda lonely , you know , just wanderin ' around . So I decided to work nights . It ai n't good to be alone , you know . &nbsp; BETSYAfter this job , I 'm looking forward to being alone for a while . &nbsp; TRAVISYeah , well . . . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people . You meet lots a ' people . It 's good for you . &nbsp; BETSYWhat kind of people ? &nbsp; TRAVISJust people people , you know . Just people . ( Pause . ) Had a dead man once . &nbsp; BETSYReally ? &nbsp; TRAVISHe 'd been shot . I did n't know that . He just crawled into the back seat , said West 45th Street and conked out . &nbsp; BETSYWhat did you do ? &nbsp; TRAVISI shut the meter off , for one thing . I knew I was n't going to get paid . Then I dropped him off at the cop shop . They took him . &nbsp; BETSYThat 's really something . &nbsp; TRAVISOh , you see lots of freaky stuff in a cab . Especially when the moon 's out . &nbsp; BETSYThe moon ? &nbsp; TRAVISThe full moon . One night I had three or four weirdos in a row and I looked up and , sure enough , there it was  --  the full moon . ( BETSY laughs . ) Oh , yeah . People will do anything in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ People too cheap to rent a hotel room , people scoring dope , people shooting up , people who want  --  25  --  to embarrass you . ( A bitterness emerges . ) It 's like you 're not even there , not even a person . Nobody knows you . ( BETSY cuts TRAVIS 's bitterness short . ) &nbsp; BETSYCom'on , Travis . It 's not that bad . I take lots of taxis . &nbsp; TRAVISI know . I could have picked you up . &nbsp; BETSYHuh ? &nbsp; TRAVISLate one night . About three . At the Plaza . &nbsp; BETSYThree in the morning ? I do n't think so . I have to go to bed early . I work days . It must have been somebody else . &nbsp; TRAVISNo . It was you . You had some manila folders and a pink bag from Saks . ( BETSY , realizing TRAVIS remembers her precisely , scrambles for a polite rationale for her behaviour . ) &nbsp; BETSYYou 're right ! Now I remember ! It was after the Western regional planners were in town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was completely bushed . It was unbelievable . &nbsp; TRAVISIf it was n't for a drunk I would have picked you up . He wanted to go to the DMZ . &nbsp; BETSYThe DMZ ? &nbsp; TRAVISSouth Bronx . The worst . I tried to ditch him , but he was already in the cab , so I had to take him . That 's the law . Otherwise I would have picked you up . &nbsp; BETSYThat would have been quite a coincidence . &nbsp; TRAVISYou 'd be surprised how often you see the same people , get the same fare . People have patterns . They do more or less the same things every day . I can tell . &nbsp; BETSYWell , I do n't go to the Plaza every night . &nbsp; TRAVISI did n't mean you . But just ordinary people . A guy I know  --  Dough-Boy  --  met his wife that way . They got to talking . She said she usually caught the bus so he started picking her up at the bus stop , taking her home with the flag up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fares must be interesting . See any stars , politicians , deliver any babies yet ? &nbsp; TRAVIS ( Embarrassed ) Well , no . . . not really . . . had some famous people in the cab . . . ( Remembering ) I got this guy who makes lasers . Not regular lasers , not the big kind . Little lasers , pocket-sized , small enough to clip to your belt  --  26  --  like a transistor radio , like a gun , you know . Like a ray gun . Zap . &nbsp; BETSY ( Laughs ) What hours do you work ? &nbsp; TRAVISI work a single , which means there 's no replacement  --  no second man on the cab . Six to six , sometimes eight . Seventy-two hours a week . &nbsp; BETSY ( Amazed ) You mean you work seventy-two hours a week ? &nbsp; TRAVISSometimes seventy-six or eighty . Sometimes I squeeze a few more hours in the morning . Eighty miles a day , a hundred miles a night . &nbsp; BETSYYou must be rich . &nbsp; TRAVIS ( Big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what you remind me of ? &nbsp; TRAVISWhat ? &nbsp; BETSYThat song by Kris Kristofferson , where it says he 's a prophet and a pusher , partly truth , partly fiction , a walking contradiction . ( Smiles . ) &nbsp; TRAVIS ( Uneasy ) I 'm no pusher , Betsy . Honest . I never have pushed . &nbsp; BETSYI did n't mean that , Travis . Just the part about the contradiction . &nbsp; TRAVIS ( More at ease ) Oh . Who was that again ? &nbsp; BETSYThe singer ? &nbsp; TRAVISYeah . I do n't follow music too much . &nbsp; BETSY ( Slowly ) Kris Kristofferson . ( TRAVIS looks at BETSY intently and they exchange smiles. ) pp. 1-13 &nbsp; pp. 27-43 INCIDENT IN A RECORD SHOP INCIDENT IN A RECORD SHOP TRAVIS is walking confusedly around Sam Goody 's at midday , obviously unable to locate what he desires . He is lost among the hip , young intellectual types that populate the store . He watches the stylish , attractive female assistant , unable to come right out and request what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , walks over and asks if he needs any help . TRAVIS inaudibly says a name to her , although the name is obviously Kristofferson 's . The sales girl digs out Kristofferson 's Silver-Tongued Devil album for him .  --  27  --  TRAVIS says something else to the sales girl and she goes off to gift-wrap the album . TRAVIS emerges from the record store , the brightly gift-wrapped album proudly tucked under his arm . Section Details A NIGHT BEHIND THE WHEEL A NIGHT BEHIND THE WHEEL A lengthy point-of-view-shot from TRAVIS 's vantage-point behind the wheel . We see the city as TRAVIS sees it . The front windscreen is a little dirty , the lit-up meter juts up at the lower right screen . The intercom crackles with static and messages . The lights turn green ; we take off with a start . A short first gear  --  quick shift  --  a long second gear . The cab eases to the right of the street , checking out prospective fares . Our eyes scan the long line of pedestrians . The regulars  --  bums , junkies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean nothing now . They only blend into the sidewalks and lighted storefronts . Our eyes now concentrate on those that step away from the kerb  --  is that man hailing a cab or scratching his head ? In the next block there are perhaps three , four fares  --  quick gas-up through this yellow light  --  brake sharply  --  check the action . The first : tourists , nickel tippers  --  let the next guy pick them up . Let the second go also , the third  --  there 's a live fare : a middle-aged local woman , short fare to the East Side , good tip . We pull over to the kerb , waiting for her to get in . It is a long wait  --  a black streetwalker crosses in front of the cab . We focus on ( as TRAVIS would ) a young couple embracing in the distance . As we travel , we hear TRAVIS 's random thoughts about selecting fares and tips . &nbsp; TRAVIS ( Voice over ) You work at night , you get an instinct . You can smell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trouble makers . Quarter is good tip for Manhattan . Queens is better , Brooklyn the best . Go for the guy with suitcases . The rich are the worst tippers , Hooks are lousy . Spooks are OK , but they do n't live on Park Avenue , after all . ( The meter is activated : $0.60 registers . Tick , tick , tick . A quick glance shows the woman is now seated . She says softly , 192 East 89 . We take off with another jolt . Cross back up 9th Avenue , then cut through the park .  --  28  --  We 're zooming up 9th Avenue ; how many green lights can we string together ? Somebody steps out to hail the cab , but quickly steps back again . The meter is up to $0.90 . It 'll be a $1.40 fare . Now through the park and we 're almost there . Check the numbers  --  134 - 140 . End of the block . The fare comes to $1.40 . Check back mirror  --  she 's getting out two bills . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either 0.25 or 0.35 . The tip comes back : 35c ; a good tip . Good lady . We take off again with a jolt . This is TRAVIS 's world : dark side streets , garish glaring main streets , quick glances , quicker evaluations  --  a dozen instantaneous decisions a minute . Are these people , are these objects ? Travis 's taxi speeds down a darkened street . TRAVIS lets off a fare and pulls into line at the Plaza . ) &nbsp; TRAVIS ( Voice over ) I called Betsy again at her office , and she said maybe we could go to a movie together after she gets off work tomorrow . That 's my day off . At first she hesitated , but I called her again and she agreed . ( Pause . ) Betsy . Betsy what ? I forgot to ask her last name again . Damn . I 've got to remember stuff like that . ( TRAVIS 's thoughts are with BETSY as three men enter Travis 's cab . He activates the meter and pulls off . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( TRAVIS checks the mirror . Scanning across the back seat , he recognizes the middle passenger . It is CHARLES PALANTINE , candidate for President . He must have left the hotel shortly after BETSY . TOM , seated on the jump seat , checks his watch and speaks deferentially to PALANTINE . ) &nbsp; TOMIt 's 12.30 now . You 'll have fifteen minutes before the actual luncheon begins . ( PALANTINE nods as his ASSISTANT picks up the thread of an earlier conversation . ) &nbsp; ASSISTANTI do n't think we have to worry about anybody here committing themselves until things start coming in from California . ( TRAVIS puts out his cigarette. )  --  29  --  &nbsp; TRAVIS ( Interrupting ) Say , are n't you Charles Palantine , the candidate ? &nbsp; PALANTINE ( Only mildly irritated ) Yes , I am . &nbsp; TRAVISWell , I 'm one of your biggest supporters , I tell everybody that comes in this cab that they should vote for you . &nbsp; PALANTINE ( Pleased ; glances to check Travis 's licence ) Why , thank you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sir . Everybody I know is going to vote for you . ( A pause . ) I was going to put one of your stickers on my taxi but the company said it was against their policy . &nbsp; PALANTINE ( Pleasant ) I 'll tell you , Travis , I 've learned more about this country sitting in taxi-cabs than in the boardroom of General Motors . &nbsp; TOM ( Joking ) And in some other places too . . . ( PALANTINE , his ASSISTANT and TOM all laugh . PALANTINE , quickly reassuming his canditorial mien , speaks to TRAVIS . ) &nbsp; PALANTINETravis , what single thing would you want the next President of this country to do most ? &nbsp; TRAVISI do n't know , sir . I do n't follow political issues much . &nbsp; PALANTINEThere must be something . . . &nbsp; TRAVIS ( Thinks ) Well , he should clean up this city here . It 's full of filth and scum ; scum , and filth . It 's like an open sewer . Sometimes I can hardly take it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get headaches that just stay and never go away . We need a President that would clean up this whole mess . Flush it out . ( PALANTINE is not a Hubert Humphrey-type professional bullshitter , and TRAVIS 's intense reply stops him dead in his tracks . He is forced to fall back on a stock answer , but he tries to give it some meaning . ) &nbsp; PALANTINE ( After a pause ) I know what you mean , Travis , and it 's not going to be easy . We 're going to have to make some radical changes . &nbsp; TRAVIS ( Turning the wheel ) Damn straight . ( Travis 's taxi pulls up in front of the Barclay Hotel . PALANTINE and TOM get out of the cab . The ASSISTANT stays in the back seat a moment to pay TRAVIS .  --  30  --  PALANTINE looks in front window of cab momentarily and nods goodbye to TRAVIS . ) &nbsp; PALANTINENice talking to you , Travis . &nbsp; TRAVIS ( Calling back ) Thank you , sir . You 're a good man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and assistants walk up carpet to the hotel . Close-up of PALANTINE as he stops , turns back and watches Travis 's departing taxi . PALANTINE turns back and ascends the hotel steps with his assistants . ) Section Details DATE NIGHT DATE NIGHT Manhattan street . Early evening . TRAVIS , dressed up to the eyeballs , walks brightly down the sidewalk . His face is freshly shaved , his hair combed , his tie straightened . He pauses in a store window to check his appearance . Under his arm he carries the gift-wrapped Kristofferson record album . Outside Palantine headquarters BETSY , smartly dressed , waves goodbye to another campaign worker and walks out the door to greet TRAVIS . A short while later , TRAVIS and BETSY are walking down Broadway towards Times Square . BETSY does not let their bodies touch as they walk although TRAVIS contemplates edging closer to her . BETSY has opened the package and is admiring the record  --  or , rather , TRAVIS 's sentiment behind giving it . TRAVIS looks round with pride : this is a moment to savour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BETSYYou did n't have to spend your money  --  &nbsp; TRAVIS ( Interrupting ) Hell , what else can I do with it all ? ( BETSY notices that the seal on the record has not been broken . ) &nbsp; BETSYTravis , you have n't even played the record ? &nbsp; TRAVIS ( Evasive ) Yeah , well my stereo player is broke . But I 'm sure the record is OK . &nbsp; BETSYYour stereo broke ? God , I could hardly stand that . I live on music .  --  31  --  &nbsp; TRAVISI do n't follow music much . I 'd like to though . ( Second thought ) Honest . &nbsp; BETSY ( Pointing to album ) So you have n't heard this record yet ? &nbsp; TRAVISNo . ( Sly smile ) I thought maybe you could play it for me on your player . ( BETSY 's face backtracks a bit . Maybe she was wrong to go out with this fellow she does n't know . She makes a polite laugh . Later . TRAVIS and BETSY are in Times Square , turning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the album under his arm . They approach the garish marquee of a large midtown porno theatre advertising The Swedish Marriage Manual . The box office is flanked on both sides by glass cages filled with explicit publicity stills . Offending portions have been blocked out with black tape . TRAVIS steps over to the window and buys two $5 tickets . BETSY , befuddled , watches him . She does n't know what to say . TRAVIS returns with the tickets . BETSY still has not fully comprehended what is happening . ) &nbsp; BETSYWhat are you doing ? &nbsp; TRAVIS ( Innocent ) I bought a couple of tickets . &nbsp; BETSYBut this is a porno movie . &nbsp; TRAVISNo , these are the kind that couples go to . They 're not like the other movies . All kinds of couples go . Honest . I 've seen them . ( TRAVIS seems confused . He is so much a part of his own world , he fails to comprehend another 's world . Compared to the movies he sees , this is respectable . But then there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much less admit : that he really wants to get this pure white girl into that dark porno theatre . He makes an awkward gesture to escort BETSY into the theatre . BETSY looks at the tickets , at the theatre , at TRAVIS . She mentally shakes her head and walks toward the turnstile . She thinks to herself : What the hell . What can happen ? She 's always been curious about these pictures anyway , and  --  like all women , no matter how intelligent  --  she 's been raised not to offend her date . A perverse logic which applies even more in offsetting circumstances like these .  --  32  --  Inside the theatre . TRAVIS escorts BETSY to an empty centre row . TRAVIS was right . Couples do go to films like this . There are at least six or seven other men with their bewigged dates . TRAVIS settles into his familiar porno theatre slouch . BETSY looks curiously from side to side . On screen , a conservatively dressed middle-aged woman is speaking in Swedish about the importance of a healthy sex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then , without warning , there is a direct cut to a couple copulating on a sterile table-like bed . TRAVIS watches intently . The colour , however , is slowly draining from BETSY 's cheeks . One thought fills her mind : What am I doing here ? ) &nbsp; TRAVIS ( To himself ) Damn . &nbsp; BETSYWhat 's wrong ? &nbsp; TRAVISI forgot to get the Coca-Cola . ( That does it . BETSY just looks at him for a moment , then gets up and starts to leave . TRAVIS , confused , hustles after her . He follows her out of the theatre . ) ( On the sidewalk TRAVIS catches up with her . ) &nbsp; TRAVISWhere are you going ? &nbsp; BETSYI 'm leaving . &nbsp; TRAVISWhat do you mean ? ( BETSY looks at TRAVIS , trying to understand him . ) &nbsp; BETSYThese are not the kind of movies I go to . &nbsp; TRAVISWell , I do n't follow movies too much . . . &nbsp; BETSYYou mean these are the only kind of movies you go to ? ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &nbsp; TRAVISThis is sort of high class . . . &nbsp; BETSYI mean porno movies . &nbsp; TRAVIS ( Hesitant ) Well . . . mostly . . . &nbsp; BETSYMy God ! &nbsp; TRAVISWe can go to another movie if you like , I do n't care . I got money . There 's plenty . . . ( TRAVIS gestures toward the long row of 42nd Street marquees , but is interrupted by BETSY . ) &nbsp; BETSYIf you just wanted to fuck , why did n't you just come right out and say it ? ( TRAVIS is flabbergasted by BETSY 's blunt language . His arm  --  33  --  still gestures toward the marquees , his lips continue to move , but words do not come out . Unable to respond to BETSY 's question , TRAVIS picks up where he left off . ) &nbsp; TRAVISThere 's plenty of movies around here . I have n't seen any of them , but I 'm sure they 're good . &nbsp; BETSYNo , Travis . You 're a sweet guy and all that , but I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TRAVIS ( Interrupting ) You mean you do n't want to go to a movie ? ( Pause . ) There 's plenty of movies around here . &nbsp; BETSYNo , I do n't feel so good . We 're just two very different kinds of people , that 's all .  --  34  --  &nbsp; TRAVIS ( Puzzled ) Huh ? &nbsp; BETSYIt 's very simple . You go your way , I 'll go mine . Thanks anyway , Travis . &nbsp; TRAVISBut . . . Betsy . . . &nbsp; BETSYI 'm getting a taxi . ( She walks to the kerb . ) &nbsp; TRAVIS ( Following her . ) But your record ? &nbsp; BETSYKeep it . &nbsp; TRAVISCan I call you ? ( BETSY looks for a cab . ) ( Tender ) Please , Betsy , I bought it for you . ( BETSY looks at his sad , sweet face and relents a bit . ) &nbsp; BETSYAll right , I 'll accept the record . ( BETSY accepts the record , but quickly turns and hails a taxi . ) Taxi ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to no one in particular . ) &nbsp; TRAVISBut I got a taxi . ( BETSY gives instructions to cab driver , looks briefly back at TRAVIS , then straight ahead . Taxi speeds off . TRAVIS looks around helplessly : a cluster of pedestrians on the crowded street has stopped to watch the argument . TRAVIS looks back at the woman in the porno theatre box office , who has also been following the argument . ) Section Details PHONE CALLS AND FLOWERS PHONE CALLS AND FLOWERS Inside Travis 's apartment . TRAVIS is writing at the table . There are some new items on the table : his giant econo-size bottle of vitamins , a giant econo-size bottle of aspirins , a pint of apricot brandy , a partial loaf of cheap white bread . On the wall behind the table hand two more items : a gag sign reading One of These Days I 'm Gon na Get Organezizied and an orange-and-black bumper sticker for Charles Palantine . &nbsp; TRAVIS ( Voice over ) May 8 , 1972 . My life has taken another turn again . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of notebook : TRAVIS is no longer sitting at desk . The pencil rests on the open notebook . Later that day : TRAVIS has pulled his straight-backed chair  --  35  --  around and is watching his small portable TV , which rests on the upright melon crate . A cereal bowl partially filled with milk rests in his lap . TRAVIS pours a couple of shots of the apricot brandy into the bowl , dips folded chunks of white bread into the mixture , and eats them . He is watching an early evening news programme . There is the sound of the TV in the background . CHARLES PALANTINE is being interviewed somewhere on the campaign trail. ) . . . one day indistinguishable from the next , a long continuous chain , then suddenly  --  there is a change . ( BETSY is walking down a midtown street when TRAVIS suddenly appears before her . He has been waiting . TRAVIS tries to make conversation but she does n't listen . She motions for him to go away and keeps on walking . TRAVIS , protesting , follows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speaks intensely into a wall pay-phone . ) I tried to call her several times . ( We hear TRAVIS 's voice on the phone : ) You feeling better ? You said you did n't feel so good . . . But after the first call , she would no longer come to the phone . ( TRAVIS holds the receiver in his hand . The other party has hung up . ) ( Tracking shot across interior lower wall of Travis 's apartment . Against the stark wall there is a row of wilted and dying floral arrangements . Each one of the four or five bouquets is progressively more wilted than the one closer to the door . They have been returned . ) I also sent flowers with no luck . I should not dwell on such things , but set them behind me . The smell of the flowers only made me sicker . The headaches got worse .

TRAVIS reluctantly picks it up and stuffs it into his jacket pocket as he gets out of the cab . He gathers up his time report and heads towards book-in table . A short while later , TRAVIS is walking down the sidewalk near the taxi garage . His hands are in his jacket pockets , obscuring the slight bulge on his left side .

( CHARLIE T cocks his imaginary gun again , fires and chuckles . WIZARD and TRAVIS nod goodbye , pay the cashier and exit . TRAVIS follows WIZARD out on to the sidewalk . TRAVIS follows WIZARD as he walks towards his cab . He has something on his mind , something he wants to talk to WIZARD about . ) &nbsp; TRAVIS ( As they walk ) Hey Wiz . &nbsp; WIZARDYeah ? ( WIZARD leans back against his cab . TRAVIS is about to speak when he spots a group of black and Puerto Rican street punks , aged between twelve and fifteen , jiving down the sidewalk towards him . One tosses a spray-paint can around his back , basketball style . Another mocks as if he 's going to scratch a key along one of the cabs . WIZARD has no visible reaction . A flash of controlled anger crosses TRAVIS 's face . He stares at the boy with the poised key . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Deli . We are reminded with a jolt that the killer lies just beneath TRAVIS 's surface . The black punk must instinctively realize this too , because he makes a cocky show of putting the key back into his pocket and be-bopping around TRAVIS and WIZARD . The young mean-streeters continue down the street and TRAVIS turns back to WIZARD . Across the street , in the background , a junkie huddles in a doorway . ) &nbsp; TRAVIS ( Hesitant ) Wiz ? &nbsp; WIZARDYeah ? &nbsp; TRAVISLook ah , we never talked much , you and me . . . &nbsp; WIZARDYeah ? &nbsp; TRAVISI wanted to ask you something , on account you 've been around so long .  --  55  --  &nbsp; WIZARDShoot .

I guess that 's the way I want it . You see , that must be what I am.  --  56  --  ( A police car stops across the street . Two patrolmen get out and roust the junkie from his doorway . ) Look , a person does a certain thing and that 's all there is to it . It becomes what he is . Why fight it ? What do you know ? How long you been a hack , a couple months ? You 're like a peg and you get dropped into a slot and you got to squirm and wiggle around a while until you fit in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dumbest thing I ever heard , Wizard . &nbsp; WIZARDWhat do you expect , Bertrand Russell ?

It 's lonely , it 's rough at first . But you fit in . You got no choice . &nbsp; TRAVISYeah . Sorry , Wizard ? &nbsp; WIZARDDo n't worry , Killer . You 'll be all right . ( Pauses . ) I seen enough to know . &nbsp; TRAVISThanks . ( WIZARD gives TRAVIS a short wave implying , chin up , old boy , and walks around to the driver 's side of his cab . He drives off , leaving the street to its natural inhabitants. ) pp. 27-43 &nbsp; pp. 57-69 A NEW FACE IN THE CROWD A NEW FACE IN THE CROWD Outside , at the Charles Palantine Rally . Day . A rally platform in a supermarket parking lot somewhere in Queens is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowd of about five hundred strong mills about , waiting for the rally to begin . Piped pop-country music plays over the loudspeaker system . A cadre of secret service men , with their distinctive metallic grey suits , sun glasses and football physiques , stands out in the crowd . On the platform are seated an assortment of local politicos as well as some Palantine workers and advisers . TOM is silently reading something of the podium , and BETSY stands on the platform steps talking to another worker . TOM looks up and to his left for a moment , then returns to what he was reading . Then he returns his gaze to the upper left , watching something very closely . After a moment he walks over to the steps where BETSY is standing .  --  57  --  &nbsp; TOMBetsy , come over here a moment . &nbsp; BETSYWhat is it ? I 'm busy . &nbsp; TOM ( Insistent ) Just follow me . ( BETSY excuses herself and walks across the platform with TOM . As they stand to the rear of the platform , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the side of his mouth . ) &nbsp; TOMLook there . ( Her eyes follow his . ) No , over further  --  get your glasses  --  yes , over there . Is n't that little guy the same guy that was bugging you around the office about a month ago ? ( BETSY , putting on her glasses , looks closely . She tries not to make her stare too obvious . ) &nbsp; BETSYNo , I do n't think so . ( A pause . ) That 's someone else . &nbsp; TOMNow look more closely . Look around the eyes and chin . See ? See there ? ( Camera closes in on TRAVIS standing in the crowd : he has shaved his head to a short stubble . There he is : brush-cut , wearing a giant grin and a large Palantine ' 72 button . Although it is a pleasant sunny day , TRAVIS is wearing a bulky bulged-out Army jacket . TRAVIS looks warily from side to side and vanishes in the crowd . ) ( A short while later , TRAVIS walks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the crowd . The SECRET SERVICE MAN  --  in sun glasses , grey suit , ever-roving eyes  --  is immediately indentifiable . Whenever TRAVIS confronts a symbol of authority , he becomes like a young boy . This time is no exception , although one suspects there is a plan hatching beneath the boyish exterior . The SECRET SERVICE MAN , for his part , is about as talkative as the Sphinx . ) &nbsp; TRAVISAre you a Secret Service Man ? &nbsp; SECRET SERVICE MAN ( Indifferently ) Why do you ask ? &nbsp; TRAVISI 've seen a lot of suspicious-looking people around here today . ( SECRET SERVICE MAN glances at TRAVIS momentarily. )  --  58  --  &nbsp; SECRET SERVICE MANWho ? &nbsp; TRAVISOh , lots . I do n't know where they all are now . There used to be one standing over there . ( Points . ) ( SECRET SERVICE MAN 's gaze follows TRAVIS 's finger for a second , then returns to TRAVIS . ) Is it hard to get to be a Secret Service Man ? &nbsp; SECRET SERVICE MANWhy ? &nbsp; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm very observant . &nbsp; SECRET SERVICE MANOh ? &nbsp; TRAVISI was in the Army too . ( A pause . ) And I 'm good with crowds . ( The SECRET SERVICE MAN is starting to get interested in TRAVIS : he definitely ranks as a suspicious character . ) &nbsp; SECRET SERVICE MANIs that so ? &nbsp; TRAVISWhat kind of guns do you guys use ? .38s ? ( The SECRET SERVICE MAN decides it 's time to get some more information on TRAVIS : ) &nbsp; SECRET SERVICE MANLook , um , if you give me your name and address , we 'll send you the information on how to apply . &nbsp; TRAVISYou would , huh ? &nbsp; SECRET SERVICE MAN ( Taking out notepad ) Sure . &nbsp; TRAVISMy name is Henry Krinkle  --  that 's with a K.

We 'll send you all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot . ( The SECRET SERVICE MAN motions to a secret service photographer to catch a picture of TRAVIS . TRAVIS notices this , and quickly slips away into the crowd . ) ( TRAVIS sits at his desk in his apartment , writing . He wears jeans , western shirt and empty holster . ) &nbsp; TRAVIS ( Voice over ) June 11 . Eight rallies in six more days . The time is coming .  --  59  --  A REMEMBERED FACE Night . Travis 's taxi picks up a fare in the midtown area and heads downtown . Lower East Side . TRAVIS lets off fare on B Street and cuts across towards Tompkins Square . TRAVIS turns the corner when skreetch ! he suddenly hits the brakes , causing the cab to rock back and forth . He has almost hit a young girl recklessly crossing the street . She thumps her hand on the taxi hood to regain her balance and stares in shock through the front window . Close-up of girl 's face . TRAVIS recognizes her face : it 's IRIS , the girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks at TRAVIS sharply then turns and continues walking . TRAVIS 's eyes follow her and she rejoins a girlfriend . They are both dressed as hippie hookers : sloppy clothes , boots , jeans , floppy hats . And the old come-hither walk is ummistakable . TRAVIS follows IRIS and her girlfriend slowly as they walk down the sidewalk . TRAVIS 's point of view : He examines them from bottom to top  --  boots , legs , thighs , breasts , faces , hats . As TRAVIS rolls astride the girls , he notices the familiar fringe of a suede jacket standing in the shadows . The girls look towards the shadowed figure , smile , acknowledge some unheard comment , and continue on . IRIS looks back uneasily at Travis 's taxi and continues on . On the corner stand two well-to-do college students , somewhat out of place in this environment , but making every attempt to groove on it . They are high on something or other . The girls spot the college students and walk over to them . They exchange some small talk and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is obviously a pick-up . TRAVIS must negotiate a turn around the corner if he is to continue following the girls and their collegiate johns . This is not so easy , since the traffic is heavy . As TRAVIS slows down to make the turn , he notices another hippie hooker who had been watching him watching IRIS and her girlfriend . She walks over to the taxi , leans in the open left front window and gives TRAVIS the come-on disguised as an innocent question :  --  60  --  &nbsp; HIPPIE HOOKER ( Close-up ) Hey , cabbie ! You comin ' or goin ' ? ( TRAVIS quickly turns his face away from her in a combination of shock , embarrassment and revulsion . He is the child caught with his hand in the cookie jar . The very presence of this crassly , openly sexual human being frightens and sickens him . He takes off with a screech . His taxi shoots down the block . ) Section Details CAMPAIGN PROMISES CAMPAIGN PROMISES A hot June day . Travis 's taxi , the Off Duty sign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . White cops , secret service men and reporters punctuate the otherwise black crowds walking to and fro in the background . CHARLES PALANTINE 's voice can be heard coming from a distant loudspeaker system . It is a political rally . TRAVIS sits behind the wheel , coldly staring at something in the distance . His hair , of course , is still clipped short and he wears mirror-reflecting sunglasses . Even though a drop of sweat is working its way down his cheek , TRAVIS wears his Army jacket with the bulge on the left side  --  the .38 Smith and Wesson bulge . A block away , PALANTINE stands on a platform outside his uptown campaign headquarters . On the platform sit an array of black dignitaries . Near by we recognize the SECRET SERVICE MAN who TRAVIS spoke to at the earlier rally : he scans the crowd anxiously . PALANTINE is speaking animatedly . He is an excellent speaker and captures the attention . He drives hard towards his arguments , crashes down on his points . His strained voice rings with sincerity and anger . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in rolled-up shirtsleeves and sweat pours down his face . &nbsp; PALANTINEThe time has come to put an end to the things that divide us : racism , poverty , war  --  and to those persons who seek to divide us . Never have I seen such a group of high officials from the President to Senate leaders to Cabinet members . . . ( Cut to TRAVIS : no expression . PALANTINE 's words are barely distinguishable from a block away . ) ( In distance. ) . . . pit black against white , young against old , sew anger , disunity and suspicion  --  and all in the name of the good of  --  61  --  the country . Well , their game is over . ( Applause . ) All their names are over . Now is the time to stand up against such foolishness , propaganda and demagoguery .

These shots have no direct relationship to the narration . ) &nbsp; TRAVIS ( Voice over , reading ) Dear Father and Mother , June is the month , I remember , which brings not only your wedding anniversary , but also Father 's Day and Mother 's birthday . I 'm sorry I ca n't remember the exact dates , but I hope this card will take care of all of them . I 'm sorry I again can not send you my address like I promised to last year , but the sensitive nature of my work for the Army demands utmost secrecy . I know you will understand . I am healthy and well and making lots of money . I have been going with a girl for several months and I know you would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Betsy , but I can tell you no more than that  --  ( As TRAVIS reads third paragraph , a POLICEMAN is seen walking from behind Travis 's taxi to his window . The POLICEMAN 's voice comes during a pause in the narration . Live sound resumes . ) &nbsp; POLICEMAN ( Standing near window ) Hey , cabbie , you ca n't park here . &nbsp; TRAVIS ( Penitent ) Sorry , officer . &nbsp; POLICEMANYou waiting for a fare ? ( POLICEMAN leans his head in window , inspecting the cab . As he does , TRAVIS slides his right hand into the left side of his jacket , ready to draw his revolver . ) &nbsp; TRAVISNo , officer .  --  62  --  &nbsp; POLICEMANAll right , move it . ( TRAVIS starts up his taxi and drives off . Live sound again ceases as TRAVIS resumes reading letter as taxi drives away . As TRAVIS reads final paragraph , scene cuts to inside his apartment where TRAVIS sits at his table . ) &nbsp; TRAVIS ( Voice over , resuming reading ) I hope this card @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I hope no one has died . Do n't worry about me . One day there will be a knock on the door and it will be me . Love , Travis. ( TRAVIS , at his desk , examines the card upon which he has just written this letter . Close-up cover of card . It is a 25 wedding anniversary card with a four-color embossed cover . The design could only be described as kitsch . A cartoon Mr and Mrs All-America stand before an outdoor barbecuing grill , clicking salt and pepper shakers in a toast . Sentiment reads : HAPPY ANNIVERSARY To a Couple Who Have Found the Perfect Combination For Marriage . . . The card opens to read : LOVE ! Underneath the word Love ! begins Travis 's short message to his parents , a message which extends to the back cover of the card . ) Section Details SWEET IRIS SWEET IRIS Night on the Lower East Side . TRAVIS sits parked in the dark shadows of a side street . The lone wolf waits . TRAVIS watches the slum goddesses as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . TRAVIS 's point of view : some of the young street girls are arrogant , almost aggressive , others are more insecure and inexperienced . A black man charges down the sidewalk across the street from  --  63  --  TRAVIS . He walks at a fast , maniacal clip , looking only at the sidewalk in front of him . Out of his mouth comes a continuous stream of invective : **128;0;TOOLONG ass . . . and so on . He is out of control . Nobody seems to notice or care . TRAVIS takes a swig of peach brandy and continues his stake-out . Finally , TRAVIS spies the object of his search : IRIS walks down the sidewalk with her girlfriend . IRIS wears her large blue sunglasses . TRAVIS checks to see if his .38 is in place ( it is ) , opens the door and exits from the cab . Flipping up the collar of his Army jacket , TRAVIS slouches over and walks towards IRIS . He sidles up next to her and walks beside her : TRAVIS always looks most suspicious when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Hello . &nbsp; IRISYou looking for some action ? &nbsp; TRAVISWell . . . I guess so . &nbsp; IRIS ( Eyeing him ) All right . ( A pause . ) You see that guy over there ? ( Nods . ) His name is Sport . Go talk to him . I 'll wait here . ( TRAVIS 's eyes follow IRIS 's nod until they reach SPORT , standing in a doorway in his lime-green jacket . TRAVIS walks towards him . SPORT , a thirtyish white greaser , has the affectations of a black pimp . His hips are jiving , his fingers softly snapping . He sings to himself , Going to the chapel , gon na get married . . . His complexion is sallow ; his eyes cold and venal . He could only seem romantic to a confused under-aged runaway . ) &nbsp; TRAVISYour name Sport ? ( SPORT immediately takes TRAVIS for an undercover cop . He extends his crossed wrists as if to be handcuffed . ) &nbsp; SPORTHere , officer , take me in . I 'm clean . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Jersey , that 's all . Honest , officer . &nbsp; TRAVISYour name Sport ? &nbsp; SPORTAnything you say , officer . &nbsp; TRAVISI 'm no cop .

He turns back towards SPORT . ) &nbsp; TRAVISI 'm no cop . &nbsp; SPORTWell , if you are , it 's entrapment already . &nbsp; TRAVISI 'm hip . &nbsp; SPORTFunny , you do n't look hip . ( Laughs . ) ( TRAVIS walks back to IRIS . She motions for TRAVIS to follow her and he does . They turn the corner and walk about a block @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and TRAVIS follows her . At the top of the dark stairs IRIS and TRAVIS enter a dimly lit hallway . On either side are doors with apartment numbers . IRIS turns towards the first door , No. 2 . ) &nbsp; IRISThis is my room .  --  65  --  ( At the far end of the darkened corridor sits a huge OLD MAN . His face is obscured by shadow . TRAVIS is about to enter the room when the OLD MAN speaks up : ) &nbsp; OLD MANHey cowboy !

( TRAVIS hesitates a moment , uncertain what to do . The OLD MAN reaches in Travis 's jacket and pulls out the .38 Special . ) This ai n't Dodge City , cowboy . You do n't need no piece . ( Glances at watch . ) I 'm keepin ' time . ( TRAVIS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's room : although dimly lit , the room is brightly decorated . There is an orange shag carpet , deep brown walls and an old red velvet sofa . On the walls are posters of Mick Jagger , Bob Dylan and Peter Fonda . A Neil Young album is playing on a small phonograph . This is where IRIS lives : it bears the individual touch of a young girl . IRIS lights a cigarette , takes a single puff and places it in an ashtray on the bedstand . &nbsp; TRAVISWhy you hang around with them greasers ? &nbsp; IRISA girl needs protection . &nbsp; TRAVISYeah . From the likes of them . &nbsp; IRIS ( Shrugs ) It 's your time , mister . Fifteen minutes ai n't long . ( Gestures to cigarette . ) That cigarette burns out , your time is up .

Travis 's cab is parked near a neighbourhood Bickford 's . TRAVIS and IRIS are having a late breakfast at a middle-class East Side coffee shop . It is about 1.30 p.m . IRIS is dressed more sensibly , wearing jeans and a maroon sweater . Her face is freshly washed and her hair combed out . Seen this way , IRIS looks no different than any other young girl in the big city . Other patrons of the coffee shop most likely assume she is having lunch with her big brother . They are both having an all-American breakfast : ham and eggs , large glasses of orange juice , coffee . Outside her environment , IRIS seems the more pathetic . She seems unsure , nervous , unable to hold a subject for more than thirty seconds . Her gestures are too broad , her voice too mannered . We sympathize with TRAVIS 's paternal response : this girl is in trouble . &nbsp; IRIS . . . and after that Sport and I just started hanging out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ removes her large blue-tinted sunglasses and fishes through her bag for another pair. )  --  70  --  &nbsp; IRISI got so many sunglasses .

Others would notice the breasts , the asses , the faces , but not TRAVIS : he notices the girl 's hand that rubs the hair on her boyfriend 's neck , the hand that hangs lightly on his shoulder , the nuzzling kiss in the ear . ) Loneliness has followed me all my life .

Anyone scanning the crowd would immediately light upon TRAVIS and think , There is an asssassin. TRAVIS pulls the vial of red pills from his pocket and swallows a couple .

It is early evening . A pudgy middle-aged white PRIVATE COP walks up to SPORT . The two men laugh , slap each other on the back and  --  79  --  exchange a soul shake .
