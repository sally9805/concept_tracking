THE TALK OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment FROM a colleague who has logged many , many miles in the air : I do n't know what to make of this . It has just come to rm , attention that Northern Illinois University , in DeKalb , has been given some scratch by the National Endowment for the Humanities for an In-Flight Humanities Project , and that the money is being spent to " test the feasibility of a ' humanities channel ' on the in-flight entertainment systems of the nation 's air transports . " The in-flight entertainment systems I am most familiar with are the liquor , the movies , the magazines , the pretty stewardesses , and the travelogues of garrulous pilots and co-pilots . That 's a lot of entertainment  --  sometimes too much  --  right there . But what the people in Washington and DeKalb arc thinking about is the canned music and comedy one can hear if one uses the headsets that most big airlines now provide . The In-Flight Humanities Project wants to add a " humanities channel . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or nine channels now available belongs to the humanities ( though some things , of course , are a lot more human than others ) . Nevertheless , Uncle Sam , who wants our minds and spirits to soar along with our bodies , thinks we need more , and what he seems to be after is some highbrow and middlebrow talk about Serious Matters ( one-hour programs , three twenty-minute segments ) to " suit the listening environment of the airline cabin . " I have never thought of myself as invading a " listening environment " when I have made my way along the narrow , crowded aisle to the smoking-permitted section  --  often an arduous journey , not lightened by the glares of disapproval that smokers get nowadays . Whenever I can , which is most of the rime , I take along enough reading to last the flight . To me , the modern , quiet , smooth-riding jet is a splendid " reading environment " and  --  if I get a window seat  --  in good weather , and sometimes excitingly in bad , a fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the Northern Illinois people are looking into  --  along with " Books and Authors , " " How Humanists Work , " and " Confrontations " ? is " Heartlands of America . " I never knew there was more than one , and on a clear day , flying over DeKalb and territory nearby , I would just as soon look at it as hear about it , though l suppose I could , to my profit , do both , just as I could tune in on " How Humanists Work " and keep my eye on a humanistic stewardess working in the aisle . ) It 's possible that the In-Flight Humanities Project may be a good thing . If it succeeds in the air , it may come to earth in buses and taxis and go underground to the subways , where there are no stewardesses , and where headsets bringing us the wit and wisdom of Max Lerner and Norman Cousins might be welcome substitutes for the earplugs we keep forgetting to buy . ? ? Chanel SINCE nothing pleases us more than a chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we lost no time in accepting an invitation from Christie 's , the London-based auction house , to attend the sale of what the firm described as " the persona collection " of Mlle. Gabrielle Chanel , the celebrated couturiere , who died in 1971 , at the age of eighty-seven . The collection , consisting of about forty suits and dresses and forty-four pieces of costume jewelry designed by , and in many cases worn by , Chanel between 1954 and 1971 , together with some three dozen accessories such as handbags and scarves , was assembled and owned by Mme. Lilian Grumbach , an enterprising Frenchwoman who started work for Chanel as her press representative and went on to become her closest colleague during the last fourteen years of her life . To make a proper occasion of the final salute to the most famous and perhaps the most influential costumer of this century , Christie 's took what was for it the unusual step of holding the sale on a Saturday evening ( when Londoners have normally fled to the country ) and , furthermore , preceding it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six o'clock . When we arrived , shortly thereafter , the scene outside Christie 's was rather like that at a movie premiere : newspaper photographers and television and radio crews were milling about at the entrance while limousines and taxis deposited guests , many in evening dress . " Pretty nobby lot for a sale of secondhand clothes , " a television sound man said as a steady stream of mink coats passed by . Moving into the foyer , we noticed among the early arrivals who were ascending the staircase to the reception , on the second floor , representatives of practically all the important fashion houses except the House of Chanel , which took a very dim view of the auction ( " It 's making money from love , " a company spokesman said ) ; the Dowager Duchess of Argyll , slender and smiling in a black satin dress and pearls ; the Ambassador of Saudi Arabia ; Baroness David de Rothschild ; and the dazzling Marchioness of Linlithgow . They were soon joined by scores and scores of other guests , speaking , it seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Far Eastern tongues , and dressed in infinite variety , who ranged from two middle-aged women in mock-Chanel outfits to a quartet of pint-sized male punk rockers , one in a paratrooper 's formfitting uniform , another in a sharp black suit and a wide gold sash adorned with what looked like Boy Scout merit badges , and all with the hair . By the time we had made our way through the ever-increasing crowd on the staircase and reached the reception , the room was so densely packed that we could barely inch our way inside , much less reach the bar where Venire Clicquot was being served . ( The fashion lovers , we learned later , polished off some twenty-three dozen bottles . ) " I heard that three hundred invitations to this elegant rummage sale were stolen and sold at hotels like theatre tickets , " a blond young man said , trying to hold his glass above the tumult . Nearby , a bespectacled older man in a dinner jacket took a firm grip on the arm of the woman with him . " This has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaving , " he said , and they started elbowing their way out . After absorbing a share of elbowing , we reached the so-called Main Room  --  also on the second floor  --  where the sale was to be conducted , and found that most of the guests with reserved seats had managed to get to them . Practically every inch of standing room was occupied , much of it by dozens of British , American , German , Italian , and French journalists and television crews . Amid the pandemonium ( the reason for which , it turned out , was that Christie 's had arranged seating for almost four hundred guests and standing room for about two hundred and fifty , and more than twice that many people had shown up ) , the firm 's public-relations director , Mr. John Herbert , and his staff had somehow been able to seat not only the guests in the Main Room but also guests with reserved seats in the West Room , where the proceedings would he carried by closed-circuit television , and to rope off an aisle through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At a quarter past seven , only fifteen minutes behind schedule , the chairman of Christie 's , Mr. J. A. Floyd , mounted the rostrum , and the sale , stage-managed by Mr. Michael Broadbent , the director who had organized the event , and who was resplendent in a velvet dinner jacket , got under way . The costume jewelry was sold first . As each item was displayed , it was described , first in French and then in English , by Princesse Jeanne-Marie de Broglie , Christie 's representative in Paris . The bidding on Lot 1 , a brooch set with three large and five smaller simulated emeralds , started at a hundred pounds and proceeded briskly to four hundred and fifty pounds , where it was knocked down to a London antique dealer . Then the prices began to go up . Lot 2 , a lozenge-shaped brooch , brought five hundred and fifty pounds . Lot 5 , an oval filigree brooch , which was said to be Chanel 's favorite piece of junk jewelry , brought a thousand pounds . Lot 8 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pearls , brought sixteen hundred pounds . That lot fetched the highest price of any of the jewelry , and was bought , as Lots 2 and 5 had also been , by a London dealer acting for a firm of Swiss jewellers named Xoilan . Altogether , they spent more than anybody else at the sale  --  an even seven thousand pounds . Other pieces  --  bangles , bar brooches , Byzantine crosses , necklaces  --  went for prices that greatly exceeded Christie 's expectations and served to keep the chairman 's face wreathed in smiles . The sets of fake pearls for which Chanel was famous ( the catalogue quoted Diem ; " With a black sweater and ten rows of pearls , Chanel revolutionized fashion " ) were snapped up for between a hundred and forty and three hundred and fifty pounds each . A pair of gilt-metal earrings went for a hundred and forty pounds ; they and the pearls that went for that figure fetched the lowest prices of any of the jewelry , which wound up bringing in a total of ? 21,420 . Maintaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sale of the wardrobe , with the modelling  --  all the suits and dresses were shown by professional mannequins  --  of the first item , a beige tweed suit hound with braid and bright-pink silk . One of Chanel 's favorite suits and a classic example of her design and tailoring , this was known to all prospective buyers as a key piece in the collection . Even so , when the bidding opened at a thousand pounds there were several well-mannered gasps in the audience . The bidding continued at a gallop , the Oslo Museum leading the way and finally claiming the suit for twenty-four hundred pounds . This was the top price of the evening ( the lowest was twenty-five pounds , for a pair of slingback shoes ) , but even the least fancied suits and dresses brought no less than five hundred pounds . The Smithsonian Institution paid a thousand pounds for a pink-and-pale-blue checked tweed suit and four hundred pounds for a quilted jersey handbag . To Christie 's surprise and disappointment , New York 's Metropolitan Museum was not represented at the sale , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addition to the Smithsonian representative . The one who made the biggest splash was a bidder apparently identified as the Jupiter Corporation , of San Francisco , which paid fifteen hundred pounds for a white silk chiffon evening dress ( the last dress that Chanel made for herself ) and eighteen hundred pounds for a brown velvet suit with a floral print . The most spirited bidding and much of the buying of the wardrobe were done by British museums , the Victoria and Albert among them , although there were many private buyers  --  including Baroness David de Rothschild , who bought seven hundred pounds ' worth of costume jewelry and paid fifteen hundred pounds for a little black dress . Aside from the accessories , the sale " Actually , Harold 's crazy about nae  --  he just does n't act out . " ? came to an end with the offering of Chanel 's so-called overalls ( they looked more like a smart sports outfit ) , made of white raised pique and , like everything else she designed , smashing to look at and efficient to wear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ member of a television crew perched on a platform near the ceiling ( " The highest bid of the evening , " the chairman said , making a little joke ) ? and the overalls went , at length , to the Bath Museum for six hundred pounds . The grand total for the evening , when it was reckoned later , came to ? 68,655 -- a result that would no doubt have given much satisfaction to Mlle. Chanel , for it rather nicely demonstrated her two favorite maxims : " Old clothes are old friends " and " Chanel never goes out of date . " Of to China RCOURI HAY , who is the celebrity ? columnist for the National Enquirer and the star and producer of his own celebrity-interview show on Channel C , a local cable-television station , said over the telephone the other day , " I am going to China . I will he there over the holidays . It 's going to be very interesting , because , let 's face it , China has turned around . My God , I think they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm going with Zandra Rhodes . You know who Zandra Rhodes is ? Well , she 's in fashion . We ca n't seem to escape it this week . j Zandra is taking her sketchbook , because they have promised to open up some museums fur us . I 'm sure her next collection will have a Chinese influence . I am taking summer clothes and winter clothes . I mean , we 're going to hot China and cold China . I am taking jeans , of course , long underwear , L. L. Bean hoots , my new Ralph Lauren baseball jacket lined with nutria . It 's in red poplin . I 'm not expecting any trouMe in China . I mean , they are embracing capitalism . I am going to dress in red , white , and blue  --  I do n't want people to think I am Russian , or something . That should he fun . I am hoping the hotels will he great , We 're not allowed to tip , but it was suggested to us that we take little trinkets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Empire State Building attached to them . That should be fun . We 've also been told not to take any ties or suits . Absolutely no tics . Interesting . For me to go away on a vacation , I have to go to extremes to avoid gossip . I mean , I ca n't just go to Europe , or something like that . That 's why I am going to China quick . With their new capitalist thinking , and our recognizing them , and all that , soon it might be like going to the Coast . I have been practicing with my chopsticks , though secretly I am hoping the food will be lousy , so that I can lose a few pounds . That 's what I would like while I 'm there . A diet free of gossip and calories . We 're leaving from San Francisco and stopping off in Manila to attend a dinner given by Mme , Marcos . Then to Hong Kong , which is a pretty normal place . I think it 's so interesting how you get to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Hong Kong . That sounds interesting . When we get to China , one of the places we arc going to is Sian . Sian is such a marvellous idea . I mean , this is so unseen by white eyes . Seven months ago , I went to Cuba , but I had to go by way of Mexico . When you go to these strange Communist countries , you have to go to another country first . On the way back , I had to charter a plane to the Bahamas . The pilot could n't speak English . Later , I found out we almost crashed . He could n't read the map . But how many people charter a plane from Cuba ? " Up Here NEAR the summit of Ferris Hill in Inwood , the highest natural point on Manhattan Island , in one of a very few private homes in the area , resides the most active member of the Washington Heights Historical Society , Mr. Edward McGuinness . Mr. McGuinness , who is a thirty-threeyear-old schoolteacher and a longtime resident of Washington Heights-Inwood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was founded for the express purpose of lobbying for landmark preservation ; in 1967 , after the organization achieved its goal on behalf of the Hamilton Grange , at Convent Avenue and 143rd Street , many members dropped out , leaving Mr. McGuinness to carry on with only about a dozen others . On his own , Mr. McGuinness has since led seasonal tours of local parks and anecdotal tours of local historical and cultural sites , and this year be was planning a Christmas Eve walk to Clement Clarke Moore 's grave , in the Trinity Church Cemetery on West 155th Street , where Moore 's poem " A Visit from St. Nicholas " ( " ' T was the night before Christmas " ) was to he recited . We met with Mr. McGuinness at his home , where he keeps his collection of local historical artifacts and bookshy his account , the largest private collection of its kind . The McGuinness home is a simple two-story brick house that was built in 1927 . Mr. McGuinness ushered us into an upstairs study , which he told us was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and there we sat surrounded by a teeming library of hooks on the subject of northern Manhattan . Mr. McGuinness wore a mustard-colored crew-neck sweater over a crispcollared tan shirt , brown tweed trousers , and smoky-gray-framed glasses , and as he spoke , quietly , puffing on a pipe , while resting comfortably in a stuffed armchair , we could sense his great enthusiasm for his native neighborhood and its history . " There really has n't been much interest in the society , to he frank with you , " Mr. McGuinness told us straightaway . " We do n't have a community that really cares about landmarks . We 're not the Village or Brooklyn Heights . But I 'll tell you  --  I can go to Rockland County , it 's attractive , or the Hudson Valley , it 's attractive , but a stone 's throw from my hack porch is Inwood Hill Park , which has more varieties of trees than Central Park , and it 's great to ramble in any time of the year . It 's quiet . The most noticeable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You could be anywhere . But ? How can I say it ? Two people hear the same symphonic music  --  one is thrilled by the gusto and fervor of the music , the other is lulled to sleep . When a neighborhood loses that diversity , it dies . And we 're losing it . For the most part , what we 've got now is a working-class community whose members have always believed that they were one kind among themselves . We need to pull in some leaven to make the rest rise . " Mr. McGuinness explained that , historically , the Heights-Inwood area has suffered from a false sense of isolation . JANUARY 1 1 9 7 9 " After the old trolley barn was moved up from Fiftieth Street between Eighth and Ninth Avenues to the Kingshridge depot , at what is now Two Hundred and Eighteenth Street and Broadway , hack in the eighteen-nineties , the German farmers moved away , and the Irish families that moved up here thought they were in heaven , " he said . " It was an area adjacent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in these Irish families began to think of themselves as beinl , better off than their relatives in the Bronx , and wanted nothing to do with the clown-town Irish they 'd left behind , either . 011 , no , not up here ' was the standard attitude . And nine Catholic churches ultimately went up in this area . So , you see , people around here were led to believe that they lived in a kind of safe preserve , all alone . " Mr. McGuinness added that a similar situation had existed in Indian times , when the peaceful Algonquian Indians isolated themselves in the woods of Inwood Hill Park , but that , while they were safely hidden there from the belligerent Canarsee Indians downtown , they were tragically blind to the Mohawk Indians canoeing down the Hudson River , weapons poised . Mr. McGuinness showed us a pas-sage in a hook that dealt with this In-dian era of Inwood history , and he cheerfully pulled out several other vol-LIMPS for us to see . Some of the titles were " Washington Heights - Its Eventful Past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it " the standard Bible " ) ; " High-ways and Byways on the North End , " by Arthur G. Swiftt ; and " The Green Meadow of Minnie 's Land " ( Minnie 's Land was the historical nickname of Inwood 1 , by Arthur Abbott . Then , having stacked the books neat to a number of privately pub-lished hooks and church documents , Mr. McGuin-ness removed several boxes and folders from a crowd-ed closet , and some small-er boxes and bound pa-pers from a davenport nesa to his armchair . All the containers were carefully wrapped and catalogued . The collection of local historical artifacts includ-ed an envelope marked " William H. Bonney as a Kid " and holding da-guerreotypes of Billy the Kid , whose family once owned a house at 159th Street and Amsterdam Avenue ; tiny wire-framed glasses and a leather-bound prayer book that had belonged to Margaret Corbin , the first woman to receive an Army pension , as a result of wounds she received during the fighting on Washington Heights , in November of 1776 ; a uniform button from the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Hessian mercenaries of the 17th Foot Regiment , who fought for the British in the War of Independence ; a series of plastic-sheathed photographs following , step by step , the construction of High Bridge , which now stands like a ruin over the Harlem River ; and a packet of clippings about the Washington Heights Historical Society 's part in obtaining landmark status for the Hamilton Grange . We particularly admired an old postcard of an amusement park on the east bank of Fort George Hill , which is now the site of George Washington High School . Mr. McGuinness suggested that he take us on a brief tour of the Heights , so we both bundled op and started down a very long and steep series of steps leading from a side street called Park Terrace East to Broadway , where we waited for a southbound M-100 bus . " See that over there ? " Mr. McGuinness said , pointing to a sturdy-looking arch over the driveway to jack Gallo 's Auto Body , at 216th Street . " That grand , noble granite arch was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shook his head , and his expression grew grim . " I mean , come on , " lie said . The M-100 bus took us down Broadway , which turned out to he the dividing line between the attractive and the unsuccessful sides of Washington Heights-Inwood . All the way from 215th Street to 155th Street , we noticed that west of Broadway , which is outlined by Isham , Inwood Hill , and Fort Tryon Parks , the neighborhood seemed unusually tranquil , while east of Broadway the apartment buildings began to look the worse for wear , and the commercial frontage was a sad patchwork of popular franchise outlets , fading neighborhood service shops , and bars . We passed the Dyckman House , at 204th Street  --  a small brick-andfieldstone house built by descendants of the early Dutch settlers of the area  --  which now appeared to be a roosting spot for Inwood 's senior citizens ; climbed slowly up a long incline to 181st Street , where the R.K.O. Coliseum movie theatre stands ; rolled by Reverend Ike 's United Church , which was once the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past the Audubon Terrace complex and into the Hundred and Forties , where Broadway grew increasingly populated . Here we passed some streets where the buildings had broken windows and useless mailboxes , and some where Mr. McGuinness pointed out rows of freshly painted and properly maintained brownstones . " You see , I never found myself isolated , having grown up in the Heights-Inwood area , " Mr. McGuinness said as we got off the bus and began walking east toward the Hamilton Grange . " When I was around junior-highschool age , I 'd get a group of friends together and we 'd go off to try to find a spot we 'd heard about in class  --  like , we heard mention of a Battle of Pell 's Point , in the Bronx . I guessed it was near a Pelham Bay station I 'd heard of in the Bronx , so we went up to Van Cortlandt Park and over the old Boston &; Westchester tracks , where the Major Deegan Expressway is now , and into the Woodlawn area . We really got lost . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took us toward Yankee Stadium , and from there we found our way back . The only thing I discovered that day was that there is a north , south , east , and west in New York City ; that night , my father and I studied the maps together . I 've never forgotten that . It 's why I am still hoping that a historical society might stir up new interest in finding the paths going hack . I mean , look at this area  --  what a shot in the arm it was for the whole community when the Hamilton Grange was made a landmark . I remember one time when I took a group down around here we saw a couple of young kids on a Hundred and Fifty-sixth Street ripping the chrome off a car , or something , and I called out to ask one of them whether he realized that on that very street Samuel Morse sent the first telegraph message over to New Jersey . ' You mean the first telegraph message was sent from my block ? ' the kid asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , ' You see , this ai n't no slum up here . ' " Mr. McGuinness smiled broadly . " That was a landmark day , " he said .
