txt Phyllis Schlafly glared down from her seat in the public gallery of the U.S. Senate . Across the aisle from Mrs. Schiafly sat Marvella Bayh , giving encouraging glances to her husband , U.S. Sen. Birch Bayh ( D ) of Indiana , who was leading a tense floor fight down below . The issue : a proposal by U.S. Sen. Jake Garn ( R ) of Utah to permit any of the 35 States that have ratified the Equal Rights Amendment ( ERA ) to rescind their previous approvals . The Garn proposal was defeated , narrowly , 54 to 44 , in a closely watched Senate vote Wednesday , clearing the way for virtually certain Senate extension of the ERA ratification deadline . That vote will come Friday . The House already has approved a three-year , three-month extension of the ratification deadline for the ERA . The Garn proposal would have , in effect , attacked the ERA on procedural grounds .

Opponents of the ERA extension have charged that supporters are trying to change the rules in the middle of the game . " No amount of rhetoric can disguise the fact that we 're abandoning procedure by allowing an extension , " Senator Garn said .

" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the ratification process is like finding yourself in the ninth inning and deciding you do n't like the score in the third or fourth inning , so you want to go back and take the runs off the scoreboard . " ERA opponents have pointed out that a congressional extension of deadline has never been voted for any amendment . To date four states ? Nebraska , Tennessee , Idaho , and Kentucky ? have voted to rescindtheir earlier approvals of the ERA . Until the actual vote , the Garn amendment was considered a close call , and it drew 98 of the 100 senators into the chamber . A few known ERA supporters , like Sen. Frank Church ( D ) of Idaho and Sen. Henry Jackson ( D ) of Washington , voted with Senator Garn , apparently for procedural reasons . The two women in the Senate , both Democrats , split their votes on the issue . Muriel Humphrey of Minnesota , who is completing the term of her late husband , voted against the Garn amendment .
