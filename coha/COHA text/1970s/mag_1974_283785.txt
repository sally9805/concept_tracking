TUESDAY THE RABBI SAW RED by HARRY KEMELMAN 276 pages . Field . $6.95 . <P> Friday the rabbi slept late , Saturday he went hungry , Sunday he stayed home , and Monday he took off ( for Israel ) . On Tuesday , in this popular mystery series , Rabbi David Small is back with his congregation in the Massachusetts town of Barnard 's Crossing . A colleague who is also going to Israel recommends Small as his replacement teacher of a course in Jewish philosophy at a nearby college . He begins his academic side career with customary zeal . When a bomb goes off in the dean 's office , apparently killing a faculty member , the police first arrest student radicals , then a dissident Jewish professor . Using his Talmudic method of looking at a problem from every conceivable angle , Rabbi Small finds a different murderer with a surefire motive : sexual jealousy . <P> Kemelman 's mysteries are unpretentious models of their kind . He writes orderly , ungimmicked plots , creates cleanly drawn characters and scrupulously avoids explicit sex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the busy , stable life of a Conservative Jew . The rabbi 's liturgical calendar , the duties and derelictions of his flock , their relations with the town 's Roman Catholics-represented by Chief Lanigan and Father Ahern-are all taken with wry , judicious seriousness . There are few such solid series around . Chesterton and Father Brown would bless Kemelman and his rabbi . <P> Martha Duffy
