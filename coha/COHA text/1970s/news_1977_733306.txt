txt Letters Letters Panama and Suez : A U.S. Double Standard To the Editor : The proposed canal treaty between the United States and Panama is not in the best interests of all parties concerned but does away with a glaring hypocrisy in United States foreign policy . I refer to our conflicting attitudes toward the Suez and Panama Canals during the past two decades . In a real sense , Suez was and is strategically to maritime Europe what the Panama Canal is to the United States . Both canals are keys to mediterranean seas . We encouraged the British to leave the Suez Canal zone . While we protested Nasser 's nationalization of the canal on July 26 , 1956 , we nevertheless prevented Great Britain and France from restoring international control of the waterway by their military actions of Oct. 31 to Nov. 6 . We then not only accepted the principle of Egyptian ownership and management but refrained from military threats or actions for nearly eight years while the canal remained closed to international traffic because of the Egyptian-Israeli conflict . This is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best interests of maritime Europe , the United Stittes'or the world . It did not . But a higher principle of American foreign policy had been enunciated . The principle , upheld by Republican and Democratic Administrations alike , was that unilateral European control was outmoded , that ultimately the West and the entire international community would have to work out a modus vivendi with Egypt if the canal was to be opened for international shipping . The principle of American foreign policy that has been applied to Suez must apply also to Panama . It is to the credit of President Carter that he has taken the initiative in eliminating the double standard which held that control of the Suez Canal belonged to its riparian state but that the Panama Canal could not . Anglo-America and the Caribbean can become a cohesive geopolitical unit only if the United States finds a new political and social accommodation with the nations to the south . Our need and ability to exercise power within the region to protect our strategic interests remains a geopolitical fact . But direct application of this power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that are acceptable to all parties concerned . otherwise our strategic interests will be undermined . T ; Panama Canal treaty is a major step forward in the forging of such a cohesive region . ( Prof. ) SAUL B. COHEN Dir. , Graduate School of Geography Clark University ? Worcester , Mass. , Oct. 5 , 1977 Of Trains . Buses and Federal Subsidies Bakke : A Panel 's Failure of Nerve ' To the Editor : A letter from J. Kevin Murphy , president of Trailways , published . in the Oct : 4 Times criticizes a Times editorial for not bothering to determine the facts in the case of reduced funding for Amtrak . Mr. Murphy , in his zeal for promotion of buses , has not bothered to determine all of the facts relating to Amtrak 's needs . I will not take the space to refute all of his claims , but here are a few facts Mr. Murphy overlooked . The $71 billion interstate highway network is a subsidy for buses ( and the trucking industry ) . Almost 20 percent of this huge outlay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buses and trucks . All of the world 's industrialized countries have ( and are improving and extending ) passenger rail systems far superior to ours , Buses are not as energy-efficient as trains in the studies I have seen . Further , electrified trains would not require oil . Lastly , the public has shown a preference for trains over buses . In the Northeast corridor , the airplane is losing passengers to . the train . Mr. Murphy says the taxpayers could save a billion dollars if Amtrak were eliminated . I wonder if he is also concerned over the $1.8 billion boondoggle called the Ten-Ton waterway , ? or the $600 million sop to the maritime industry so oil can be carried in U.S. ships , or the $41 billion now projected to finish the interstate highway system .

Wargo , apparently unable to rebut my soft-energy-path arguments on their merits , is now bringing to your columns ( letter Sept. 30 ) the personal attack he began in the August issue of Nuclear Industry , a magazine published by the Atomic Industrial Forum , Inc . I am glad to note Mr. Wargo 's agreement that soft technologies are a good idea and should be phased in gradually as I proposed ; to confirm the credit due to many other analysts whose concepts I have synthesized into a new one ( as a sort of midwife , if Mr. Wargo prefers the term to " father " ) ; to suggest that it is Mr. Wargo and his colleagues , not I , who have " fomented " a controversy by publishing slanderous criticisms devoid of technical merit , and to mention , as he failed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Atomic Industrial Forum . AMORY B. LOVINS Washington , Oct. 2 , 1977 To the Editor : Attorney Alfred Fitt , quoted in The Editorial Notebook of Sept. 12 ( " In ' Fact , There Is No New Wrong " ) , seems so intent on dismissing Allan Bakke as a suitable challenger to the University of California 's special admissions program at the Davis School of Medicine that he neglects the glaring failure of nerve exhibited by the majority admissions committee there . If that body could find , as Fitt tells us , 36 white applicants with lower grades than Bakke 's to whom it wished to offer entering places , then presumably it looked beyond grades to the several other essential characteristics in a prospective physician . It might even be said that it made a point of doing so , for whites . But why not for blacks , or browns , or Asians ? Why did a committee believe it could choose its white students within broad , ' socially responsible parameters and yet never extend itself to the needs of the minority applicant group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is there not some way in which race- , related characteristics can be accounted it , the evaluation of all applicants ? I find it curious that the California Supreme Court found it neces- ? sary to instruct the committee , and its counterparts elsewhere , on how to proceed . Whatever else their effects have been , programs such as Davis 's have enabled hundreds of minority students to gain admission to medical schools . More significantly , they are succeeding in , the demanding curriculums there and as a group constitute the best possible argument , for enhanced admissions criteria . The U.S. Supreme Court now has the opportunity to give directions to committees throughout the land who have it in their charge to admit our future physicians . May they do so , after Bakke , fairly and confidently . PETER C. STORANDT - Associate Director of Admissions Oberlin College ' Oberlin , Ohio , Sept. 30 , 1977 Eskimos and the Bowhead Whale : Questions of Survival To the Editor : We were saddened that The Times 's editorial of Oct. 1 dismissed as one of the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ban on their subsistence hunting of the bowhead whale . The ban was voted by the International Whaling Commission without consultation with the Eskimos . To the Eskimos the outcome of the debate will determine whether they will survive as a people . They fear that the commission will not stop until it has destroyed their culture and reduced their self-reliant villages to welfare ghettos . Eskimos object to the ban because the commission does not have jurisdiction over Eskimo subsistence whaling and because the ban violates constitutional guarantees protecting Eskimo culture and society from unwarranted Federal intrusion . The Eskimos do not claim the right to exterminate the bowhead . Such a proposition would be unthinkable to them , since it is the basis of their life and identity . They point out , however , that there is no scientific justification for the ban . The consensus is that the bowhead population is stabilized or has been increasing since the end pf commercial whaling more than 50 years ago . The current Eskimo harvest is below historic limits , and over the last . three years the average harvest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against an average of 33 whales harvested during the prior three-year period . Eskimo whaling communities can be expected to resist Federal enforcement of the commission 's unlawful ban , just as millions of Americans would resist a Presidential order closing churches and synagogues on the pretext of con- , serving energy . Responsible government officials predict that enforcement may require military occupation of-the villages . Eskimo leaders are seeking by lawful means to avoid a hopeless armed confrontation with the Federal Government . Unless the Carter Administration commits itself now to Eskimo human rights and the rule of law , it may find itself entrapped in a policy of violence against native Americans unknown in our nation since the , Indian wars . If regulation of Eskimo hunting is required , the United States has unquestioned authority under the Marine Mammal Protection Act and the Endangered Species Act to protect both the whales and the Eskimos . These domestic laws afford the Eskimos due process ; the International Whaling Commission does not . All Americans should object to any efforts by the commission and among extremists in the environmental movement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on American Indian Affairs New York , Oct. 5 , 1977 . To the Editor : Your Oct. 1 editorial " Tale of the Bowhead " asks the question , " .. . why not accept the one-season ban and seek a modest and defensible quota next year ? " From the point of view of the bowhead whale , this may be ' a most attractive proposal . But from the point of view of certain Alaskan peoples in remote Arctic areas who depend upon the limited hunting of the The Times welcomes letters from readers .

These Alaskans ( who incidentally prefer the name " Inuit " to the name you use , " Eskimo " ) are willing to accept a " modest and defensible quota . " And it is true , as your writer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that modern technol- . ogy has increased dramatically the annual take of this endangered species of whale . But is a total freeze the best answer ? Many think not , once they are given a balanced picture of the problem : It is as if one were to propose that because there are occasional instances of misuse in the public welfare system , the whole system be shut down for a year for redesign ? regardless of the hardship visited upon most welfare recipients . North Americans , especially in the " lower 48 , " are famous for their pendulum shifts in public attitudes , from great generosity to total rejection in one great leap . But the Inuit of our northern state deserve better . However reluctantly , the U.S. . Government should file an objection to the International Whaling Commission's. decision ; and thus not be forced to deny hungry Inuit peoples in a harsh environment what may , be their only food resource for part of the year ahead .
