By comparison with the great influenza epidemics , the plague that hit Minnesota recently was a trivial affair . One hundred and twenty-five people were stricken with nausea and diarrhea after eating in a local restaurant . No one died in the outbreak , but about 50 were sufficiently sick to consult physicians , eleven were afflicted seriously enough to require hospitalization , and many were bedridden for one or more days . Normally , such an outbreak , which was traced to Salmonella bacteria , receives little attention from health authorities . <P> But researchers from the Center for Dis ease Control in Atlanta and the Minnesota Department of Health studied this one to get an idea of its economic impact . They found that it was expensive indeed . Those who went to the hospital spent $2,965 . The restaurant owner lost an estimated $5,000 worth of business as a result , and the investigation cost $2,355 . The biggest loss was in wages of those who missed work : $18,413 , which pushed the cost of even this mini-epidemic to $28,733.     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
