What ails U.S. Catholicism ? Attendance at Mass , private prayer , contributions and most other measures of members ' commitment have been skidding for years . One common explanation : the changes in the church since the start of the Second Vatican Council in 1962 , including putting the Mass into the vernacular and allowing meat eating on Friday , have confused and alienated the Catholic community . <P> A major sociological study issued last week , however , claims that such liberalizing measures are in fact highly popular . Instead , the study puts the blame for the U.S. church 's decline squarely on Pope Paul 's 1968 encyclical against " artificial " birth control . Disillusion over the encyclical , in fact , may have cost the American church more than $1 billion a year in contributions . That contention is part of a book by Andrew M. Greeley , William C. McCready and Kathleen McCourt : Catholic Schools in a Declining Church ( Sheed &; Ward , 483 pages ; $15 ) . In it Father Greeley , 48 , a sociologist and acidulous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " a shattering blow " to the loyalty of U.S. Catholics . He predicts that future scholars will adjudge it " one of the worst mistakes in the history of Catholic Christianity . " <P> The book is based on mid-1974 interviews with a national sample of 927 Catholic adults conducted by a team from the University of Chicago 's National Opinion Research Center . The center conducted a similar survey in 1963 , and some of the changes in Catholic attitudes it found over the decade were previously reported ( TIME , Jan. 13 , 1975 ) . While the link between attitudes toward the Pope 's encyclical and church decline is the book 's most sensational finding , much of the new survey-as in 1963-deals with parochial schools . <P> Radical Solutions . Despite a recent high school upturn , the total enrollment in parochial schools is well below that of 1963 . Though many people assume that the reason is rising tuitions , the Chicago study found the major problem to be that schools simply are not available . The book accuses bishops of a major miscalculation in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the suburbs . Not only does Catholic sentiment and support for parochial schools remain nearly universal but , the survey indicates , Catholics would be willing to give some $1.8 billion more a year to expand their school system . The survey also finds that in a period of church decline the schools have become more important for developing committed adult Catholics than they were in 1963 . <P> Greeley has already briefed officials at the Vatican and the U.S. Catholic Conference on his findings , and he does not hesitate to propose radical solutions . It would be extraordinary but possible for the Pope to " repeal " the birth control encyclical , and Greeley thinks it must be done to halt U.S. church " deterioration . " As for the schools , he expects further dwindling of enrollment unless the bishops let the laity take control of fund raising and administration . Says Greeley : " If I were a bishop and I saw this data , I 'd call a panic meeting . " Archbishop Joseph L. Bernardin , head of the U.S. bishops ' conference , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth , " he replied to inquiries about the book , " is not determined by sociological data or analyses . "
