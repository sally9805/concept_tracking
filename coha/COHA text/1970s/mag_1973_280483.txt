The flood damaged only one major work of art beyond repair : Cimabue 's Crucifix ( Church of Santa Croce ) . <P> Major works damaged but now successfully restored include : <P> Two Crucifixions by Fra Angelico , one in the Church of San Niccolo del Ceppo and the other in the Museum of San Marco ; <P> Domenico Ghirlandaio : Adoration of the Shepherds ( Church of Santa Trinit ) ; <P> Taddeo Gaddi : fresco , the Last Supper ( Museum of Santa Croce ) ; <P> Alessandro Allori : Christ Lowered from the Cross ( Museum of Santa Croce ) . <P> Among works still awaiting restoration are the Sacrifice of Isaac by Allori ( Church of San Niccol Oltrarno ) , Bronzino 's Christ Descending into Limbo ( Museum of Santa Croce ) , and Ghiberti 's and Pisano 's bronze doors from the Florence Baptistry-which restorers may have to coat with a transparent synthetic resin , now under research in Italy , to protect them from worse damage by air pollution .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
