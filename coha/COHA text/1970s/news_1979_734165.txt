txt When newsmen were called into the office of President Kennedy on a March evening in 1962 to be told he was nom inating Byron R. White to the Supreme Court , few of them could have suspected that he would one day become their judicial nemesis . Yet this former Kennedy deputy attorney general has written a series of majority opinions for the high court over the past seven years that has thrown the American press sharply on the defensive , both legally and psychologically . The " White court , " as the court of Chief Justice Warren E. Burger has been referred to in press freedom cases , has steadily chipped away at legal immunities which journalists had presumed to enjoy under the Constitution 's First Amendment in protecting their confidential news sources , their notes and files , and ? now ? their very thought processes . The court 's " strict constructionism " toward press rights is summed up by four far-reaching decisions written by Associate Justice White , joined by four or five of his fellow jurists : ? Journalists ' thoughts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state of mind " are thrown open to judicial inquiry in libel trials by a ruling April 18 requiring CBS television producer Barry Lando to answer such questions // From page 1 White court ' shrinks freedom of the press in a libel suit brought by retired Army Lt. Col. Anthony Herbert over a 1973 " 60 Minutes " program . ? Reporters ' notes , files , tapes , photographs , and other working materials are made vulnerable to surprise search-warrant raids on newsrooms by police seeking information on crimes , under a decision last June upholding such a raid on the Stanford University newspaper . ? Newsmen are compelled to testify to grand juries about information from confidential news sources , in two 1972 decisions involving reporters Earl Caldwell , then of the New York Times , and Paul Branzburg of the Louisville Courier-Journal . In other rulings not written by Justice White , the court has effectively voided a state 's reporter-protection law by allowing a reporter to be jailed for refusing to disclose in court information obtained in confidence ( the case of M. A. Farber of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declined to review ) , and denied the press any greater access to government information than for the general public ( a case last June involving jail tours ) . Thrust of decisions The thrust of these decisions , according to the jurists who have rendered them , is to bring the legal immunities of journalists within the nation 's justice system into closer balance with those of other Americans . " The rules , " as Associate Justice White writes in the Herbert-Lando opinion , " are applicable to the press and to other defendants alike . " But this narrow interpretation of the special position accorded to the press by the Constitution is vigorously challenged within the federal judiciary itself . The federal appeals court whose decision was overturned by the Supreme Court this week , for example , claimed that authorizing judicial examination of newsmen 's mental framework would leave journalists " chilled in the very process of thought . " Do these judicial rulings have such a " chilling " effect on the flow of news ? News media groups and civil libertarians have long claimed so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be happening . Papers ' censored itself ' One newspaper , the Sacramento ( California ) Bee , recently confided to its readers that it had " censored itself " by deciding against publishing a story which was obtained " from confidential sources and concerned a matter of substantial public interest , " because it could have led to the jailing of the reporter . Others in the business privately suspect many similar , unpublicized cases of self-censoring . The dispute over reporters ' rights is often dismissed as private courtroom jousting between judges and journalists , holding little interest for the rest of Americans . But this may be changing . The Supreme Court 's approval of police raids of newsrooms has unleashed so heavy an outpouring of opposition from members of Congress who need not have taken a side ? some of Congress 's most liberal members , staunch conservatives such as Sen. Robert J. Dole ( R ) of Kansas and Rep. Philip M. Crane ( R ) of Illinois , and the Carter White House ? that Congress is expected to enact a law overruling it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
