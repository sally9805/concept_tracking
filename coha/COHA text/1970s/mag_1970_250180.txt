would anyone become a college president ? The job requires a peerless fund raiser , diplomat , orator and cop - a man who can tame romantic radicals , soothe rival professors , work ungodly hours and somehow prove his own scholarly prowess . <P> In recent years , student revolts have broken many a college president and kept numerous campuses headless across the country . Even so , a whole new generation of willing masochists has lately taken over many of the nation 's top campuses , including Bryn Mawr , Cornell , Hunter , Mount Holyoke , Penn State and Swarthmore . Among the brightest presidential faces : <P> UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA . Martin Meyerson , 47 , was the Harvard-trained head of Berkeley 's College of Environmental Design in 1965 when he became acting chancellor after Edward Strong was eased out during the Free Speech Movement . Meyerson quickly proved that he could deal with both angry students and upset professors . A year later , he became president of the State University of New York at Buffalo , where he drew on his planning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from an obsolete city campus to a new 1,200-acre suburban site , a plan now blocked by a dispute over the hiring of minority construction workers . Meyerson also streamlined Buffalo into eight faculties , each with its own provost and budget . With rare aplomb , he charmed campus radicals while pioneering the now widely used tactic of getting courts to enjoin seizers of campus buildings . Meyerson 's diplomatic tal ents fit Pennsylvania 's needs precisely . Despite its Ivy League aura , the 230-year-old university is crammed into a downtown Philadelphia campus , where the new president will have to reconcile both student rebels and resentful blacks in the surrounding ghetto . <P> MICHIGAN STATE . Clifton R. Wharton Jr. , 43 , is the first Ne gro to head a major American university that is predominantly white . He is less interested in his significance as a black " first " than in enlarging Michigan State University 's commitment to his consuming interest - combatting poverty and pro moting agricultural growth at home and in underdeveloped countries . An economist long associated with the Rockefeller-backed Agricultural Development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ student-faculty screening committee and elected by the trustees over two other nominees , including Michigan 's ex-Governor G. Mennen Williams . Ironically , Wharton 's main problem at the giant East Lansing campus ( 40,000 students ) may be with black militants , who suspect his Establishment background . A graduate of Harvard , Wharton is a director of the Equitable Life Assurance Society and the son of a former U.S. Ambassador to Norway . His pedigree spells authentic black power - but not to the militants . <P>
