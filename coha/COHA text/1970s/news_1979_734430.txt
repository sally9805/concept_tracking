The mayor , who is due to release the first budget of her administration Nov. 14 , has pressed her department heads in recent weeks to comply with the 10 per cent budget cuts she ordered in August . But inflation and millions of dollars in rollover costs  --  those for which there were insufficient funds in the 1979 budget  --  will force a slight increase over the $1.35 billion budget of 1979 if the mayor grants pay raises , as she has promised , to the city 's more than 40,000 workers . Although administration officials refused to comment Friday on the probability of an increase in one of the city 's tax levies in 1980 , the budget growth virtually will guarantee some form of tax increase .

There are 10 other taxes , such as the levies on hotel rooms and cigarets , that could be raised . A KEY FACTOR In the final form the budget and any tax increase might take will be the size of the cost-of-living raises the mayor grants to city workers . City Hall sources said Friday that no final determination has been made on the size of the increases .
