txt The Board of Education is considering the possibility of using about $25-million in unspent salaries and strike Tienshies to rehire 2,000 laid-off teachers to help reduce class sizes and improve school conIditiOns . This was disclosed as talks aimed . at ; ending the week-long city teachers ' strike recessed yesterday afternoon because of the Jewish holy day of Yom Kippur . The $25-million would represent salaries not paid to teachers for the time they are on strike , plus a matching amount they will lose under the penalties of the state 's Taylor Law . The law prohibiting strikes by public employes provides , among other . things , that employes who strike lose two days ' pay for each day they are out , with the employer keeping the penalties as well as salary savings . Pact . Reported Near As the contract talks between the , bOard and the United Federation of Teachers recessed until tonight , officials on both sides said that an , agreement was near but not concluded . Albert Shanker , president of the teachers ' union , who observed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreement was reached when the negotiations resumed , it would be too late for teachers to return to their school posts tomorrow morning at their regular time . But he said that teachers might , if the union members had ratified the agreement , go back " some time " tomorrow . This could enable schools to open Wednesday at their normal time for both teachers and pupils . Most Teachers Out The strike , which started the day after the fall term began , has kept virtually all of the city 's 55,000 teachers and 1.1 million pupils out of school since Tuesday . The union said the walkout had been sparked by poor school conditions , particularly excessively large classes , that the teachers had encountered on opening day . But the larger issue was the // inability to reach agreement on . a new contract that would reconcile the board 's insistence on greater teacher productivity ; with the union 's reluctance to yield benefits and conditions won in previous contracts . " We are near a conclusion , closer than we ever were , " Mr. Shanker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hotel Plaza were halted because of Yom Kippur . The decision to . call a recess was made by the I board . " We are moving intently and hopefully toward a conclusion , " ; said Dr. Robert J. Christen , the vice president of the Board of Education and its chief negotiator . The two negotiators spoke to reporters at a joint news ! conference . Fast Vote Planned Mr. Shanker said that the ' union had scheduled a series ; of meetings so that a proposed contract could be quickly put ; to the union 's executive board. , delegate assembly and general ! membership . The meetings , starting at 9 P.M. , will be held in the Felt-Forum of Madison ; Square Garden . ' Officials on both sides cau- : tioned that it was still possible that some new obstacle to an agreement might arise , as has happened frequently during ! . the last week when earlier settlements seemed imminent . According to officials on both sides , the new . school contract being discussed would prob . ably contain the following : 41The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three , as was the length of the previous contract , which expired last Monday night . ' IThe controversial $43-mil.lion that was put into the board 's budget for possible sal , ary wage increases for teachers  --  and then frozen by recent city controls  --  will he allotted to teachers in line with some ? formula still to be worked out . ? There has been confusion all week over the status of the $43-million , and the thought . now is that the money should be allotted for its original purpose , even if the city decides to freeze it . ( ITeachers in a majority of  --  the elementary and junior high ; schools  --  those with so-called Title I designations because they enroll large numbers of poor pupils  --  would relinquish 1two 45-minute preparation or free periods each week . These ! teachers would still have one more " prep " than do teachers , in non-Title I schools . 9All elementary and junior I high schools would end instruc ' tion 45 minutes early two days each week . Teachers would use this time for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pupils present , there would ' be no need to have other teachers cover their classes , as is the practice now when prep periods fall within the regular ' instructional day . The cutback in prep time and the two early school closings. negotiators said , were tantamount to $48-million in economies and teaching time that could he used to reduce class sizes . The use of the money saved in unspent teachers ' salaries and penalties  --  estimated earlier at about $10-million for each , strike day but scaled down ves. terday to somewhat over half that figure  --  would he used to rehire some of the 4,500 recent ' ly laid-off instructional employes . ? No decision on this has as yet been made , but hoard ne. gotiators said that this was a very " live " possibility  --  one . undoubtedly , that would soften the resentment of the striking ' teachers at losing pay and the penalties . One major objection to the . use of " saved " money to rehire. teachers is that this money is ! a one-time proposition . Because : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who think the board should . use half the money this year to : rehire only about 1,000 teach- ! ers and to reserve the other half to retain the same teachers next year . After the last school strike : in 1968 , teachers were able to ! recover their lost pay by work-1 ing after-school make-up sessions for pupils . School officials , later acknowledged that these programs were ineffective and ' poorly attended by pupils . Ne. -j gotiators said that no serious ; consideration was being given ! this time to the idea of make-1 up programs . The proposal to cut two prep periods from teachers and to ! schedule two others in the time ! period that would he cut from : the school day were contained : in a report Issued late Friday : by a panel of three fact finders ; appointed by the State 's Public ! Employment Relations Board . Although the fact finders , : concluded their participation ! with the announcement of their ! report , Harold Newman , chief : of conciliation for the state : board , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressure for a settlement before 2:30 P.M. tomorrow has come from State Supreme Court Justice Irving H. Saypol , who on Friday found Mr. Shanker and other union leaders in " wilful violation " of a court order to call off the strike . The union officials are scheduled to appear tomorrow before Justice Saypol for sentencing . They can receive jail terms of up to 30 days and fines of up to $ ' 250 . But the judge also said that he would at that time direct the city 's five District Attorneys to undertake separate criminal proceedings against those violating the no-strike law . These proceedings could involve penalties of up to a year in jail . The union 's 75-member executive board will meet at Medison Square Garden 's Felt Forum , at 0 P.M. tonight , either tol ratify a prospective agreement : or to reaffirm the strike . The 1,300-member U.F.T. del-1 egate assembly , along with I chapter chairmen from each of the city 's 950 schools , will fol- ! low the executive board into : the Felt Forum for a meeting at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Felt Forum will ' remain open through the night ; and until 11 A.M. Tuesday morning for a ratification vote ! by the entire union member- ! ship .
