SOME WHERE DOWN THE TUNNEL of the Nixon years , teased by hints of peace , we stopped thinking much about the Bomb , about rockets and warheads and ICBMs , about credible deterrence and balance of terror and the ultimate holocaust . I propose to think about them only a little now , but what has become of the men and women whose lives such matters occupy ? What are the makers of bombs doing today , at the fin. of our siecle , when accords are signed and bans are published and the SALT talks grind on ? Do they work now for the fruits of detente , or do they brood over other , darker inventions to plague us ? Can a young scientist of good character and native birth still find opportunity at Los Alamos or has the Atomic City shriven itself and closed up shop ? What 's new in the workshop of the apocalypse ? Is anybody home ? Well , to begin with , Los Alamos is thriving , an open city now if not an open laboratory , a : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory ( LASL ) , including more than 1,200 with ad7anced scientific degrees . Los Alamos is thirtyive miles north and west of Santa Fe , New dexico , over good roads that follow the Rio ; rande Valley and then cross the river and the lusty valley and wind up canyon walls onto the ' ajarito Plateau , behind which the Jemez Mounains , the collapsed rim of an ancient and enornous volcano , rise to an altitude of more than 0,000 feet . Los Alamos itself is 7,300 feet igh , an altitude that , at the very least , diseourges strong drink . The Atomic Energy Commis-ion opened the Los Alamos gates in 1957 and onverted the secret city into an ordinary town , ven though the majority of its citizens , whose ork is the defense of the free world , feared Dor-to-door salesmen and unsafe streets and irious , possibly hostile , tourists and voted to aep it closed . Their fears proved unfounded ; le worst Los Alamos has experienced in the ay of visitors was a delegation of peacefulsouls that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anniversary of the Hiroshima bombing , and held a quiet rally and planted a cherry tree . In the dark of the night , someone in town dug up the tree and dragged it away , but the people at the lab were shocked by that desecration and replaced the tree with one of their own . And the first burglar ever apprehended in Los Alamos turned out to be a ringer , a former security man . The lab itself has long since been moved from its wartime location on Los Alamos Mesa next to Ashley Pond ( a small body of water that preserves the memory of Ashley Pond , who founded the Ranch School for Boys that originally occupied the mesa ) to newer quarters on South Mesa , across a deep and narrow canyon spanned by a single sturdy bridge , and has spread out to new areas as distant as twenty miles away . It is no longer the only weapons laboratory ; the AEC supports six national laboratories , including Brookhaven on Long Island and Livermore in California , over the hills from Berkeley . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , keen for glory , more hawkish than Los Alamos , as hawkish as Edward Teller , the Hungarian-born " father of the H-bomb , " whose living memorial it is . " You have to understand the deep Hungarian fear of the Russians to understand Teller , " a Brookhaven scientist visiting Los Alamos told me one lunch hour in the dim recesses of the Los Alamos Inn . Teller , said the Brookhaven man , rewards his boys with peaceful projects only when they 've done their weapons work well . Swords and plowshares L OS ALAMOS IS STILL the premier weapons L laboratory . Its present director , Dr. Harold Agnew , a physicist who worked for Enrico Fermi at the University of Chicago and who was one of the men who accompanied the Fat Man bomb to Hiroshima , told me : " All of the Army weapons except for the Lance rocket warhead were developed here , all of the Air Force weapons that are presently deployed were developed here , all of the missile warheads deployed in Europe were developed here . The submarine weapons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ missile warhead will be developed here . " Los Alamos has developed the warheads for most of the weapons systems that burden and protect us , huge bombs that can melt entire cities , modest cannon shells that can stop a tank attack or take out a bridge or two , demolition devices a man can carry in a suitcase , multiple warheads that a clever rocket " bus " can independently target from out in near-space , single bombs that can be dialed for different yields as the coffee grinder at the A &P; can be dialed for different grinds . The scientists at Los Alamos have done their Faustian work in the name of the balance of terror ( a balance that some advanced strategists are beginning to doubt ) but designing weapons is not what they would prefer to do , so they say , and who is so uncharitable as to disbelieve them ? As they tell it , they would prefer to do basic research , which sometimes leads to weapons but which is , of itself , morally neutral ( if anything men do is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the technology born of that research for the betterment of mankind . To a modest extent , they do . Weapons money accounts for about 68 percent of LASL 's annual budget of about $120 million , " but , as Harold Agnew points out , " the weapons money has always been the seed money for the new ideas , the basic research . " Some money also comes to * Though he promised me detailed budget figures , LASL 's alternate financial management officer , Rolf Peterson , never delivered , pleading the burden of other work . My figures are therefore approximate . LASL for specific , nondefense-related projects , as it had better , because lacking special funding , such projects must limp along on a few hundred thousand dollars a year at best . Los Alamos is today , as it has always been , a weapons laboratory first of all . Still , its other projects are intriguing , and the men who run them are intriguing , and they ' say much about the organization and operation of the lab . Among those projects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better transmission wire , and the Great Solenoid . All three projects have to do with the energy crisis ? Los Alamos is working hard to solve the energy crisis -- and all three represent research underway in LASL 's Q Division , which is specifically concerned with energy and which was only assembled , from bits and pieces of projects spread all over the laboratory , in February 1973 . Q Division is headed by Ed Hammel , Jr. , a physical chemist out of Darmouth and Princeton who worked on plutonium development during the war . Hammel and his people are working primarily on conserving the energy we already have , producing , transmitting , and using it more efficiently . Right now , for example , it 's hard for power companies to store large amounts of electricity ; even the best methods are only about 60 percent efficient . One alternative is supersized storage batteries that might be 70 percent efficient ? " Run Chicago on batteries a few hours a day , " Hammel says wryly . Another is solenoids of massive inductance that would store electricity in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea , in turn , is a spinoff from research conducted at LASL into controlled thermonuclear fusion . Both projects are based on the remarkable effect known as superconduction , an effect that becomes possible in conductors when they are cooled to near absolute zero , - 459 degrees Fahrenheit . At such low temperatures , most metals and some organic materials lose all resistance to the passage of electricity ; a current started in a loop of superconducting wire will , theoretically , continue to circulate forever . Thus the experimental solenoid , once charged with electricity sufficient to support its powerful magnetic field , could be effectively closed off , short-circuited , and left to stew in its own juices until a city needed them again . Cryogenics , the science of extremely low temperatures , got its start at Los Alamos way back in World War II . In those days , when everyone else was toiling night and day to build a fission bomb , Teller was off tinkering with the notion of a thermonuclear one , and Los Alamos was looking into cryogenics for the simple reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasonable size that uses hydrogen , you are probably going to have to liquefy or freeze the hydrogen , and hydrogen freezes at - 427 degrees 58 Fahrenheit . So LASL has worked with cryogenics for many years , and batteries or solenoids to run American cities are only the latest green fruits to swell on that tree . EARER TO PRACTICAL APPLICATION is anIN other cryogenic development : superconducting transmission lines , better wires . These would have obvious advantages : they can carry larger loads , they can carry direct current without resistance , and they require , for direct current , only two wires instead of three . They would be exotic , to say the least : underground pipeline systems with refrigeration units spaced every five miles pumping supercooled helium through the jackets around the wires . But they would cost less than other high-voltage underground systems and they would save electricity . Los Alamos is not only developing the new systems ; it has also shaved years off their projected delivery date . " Sometimes , " says Ed Hammel , " we can significantly speed up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transmission was n't supposed to be in sight before 1990 " ? that was the power industry 's estimate , based on its own commitment to research ? " but we expect now to have an experimental station in New York City , at Consolidated Edison 's Astoria station , within three years . " Putting an experimental station on line with a real power company means that other power companies can see and believe the results , whatever they prove to be . If the Con Ed installation works , we can expect superconducting transmission systems to spring up around the nation soon after ? which means that the biggest power lines will be going underground . Underground power lines do n't necessarily warm an environmentalist 's heart , since the technology of tunneling is crude and expensive , and the alternative , ditch and fill , terribly disfigures the land . Los Alamos has been working on that problem , too , having fallen into it almost accidentally , on a coffee break . LASL worked for many years on a program galled Rover , a program to design @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ astronauts far into deep space . Dne of the ways to test the system 's new fuel elements was to put them into a bell jar , exhaust : he air from the jar , and pass an electric current hrough them , which caused them to glow white ind hot as the filament in a light bulb . John Rowley , who is now in charge of the sole-drilling project , which is under the Q Diviion and is called Subterrene , tells the story veil . " A couple of these units were working in laboratory area while we were sitting around laving a coffee break , chewing over the Rover . roblem , and I think it was Eugene Robinson , ne of the fellows in the chemistry group ? he'sdead now ? who said , ' Gee , you know , that looks hot enough to melt rock . ' We went out and got some rocks and made up some of these things in slightly different form , and by God it worked . Then for a while it was , Can you make a hole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different type of rock . Hard rocks , usually , though it turns out that making holes in soft rocks ? in soil or rubble , for example ? is much more difficult . And that 's how the program got started . " R OWLEY HAS A LABORATORY full of holes ; an-other hole , neatly framed in Plexiglas , sits on the conference table in Harold Agnew 's office . Subterrene is one of the more successful LASL programs , modest in cost and highly visible , a gadget that fulfills every little Leonardo 's dream and is practical as well . What a Subterrene can do is drill holes with its superhot " penetrator " in almost any kind of rock or soil and line them with their own " glass " pipes . The holes can be drilled vertically or horizontally or at any angle between , more practically and at less cost than most conventional holes , because the Subterrene turns the material that fills the hole into lava , which can then be extracted in several different forms , depending on the client 's requirements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as rock wool ? and it makes its own pipe . " Steel pipe , " says Rowley , " is very expensive and very difficult these days even to get . " Rowley has drilled holes in stone walls , in granite and basalt , in dirt , even in sand ; they are round and smooth as ceramic sewer pipes and somewhat more reduced . The horizontal holes require no ditching or bracing even when they are drilled through loose soil , because the soil around the hole , melted and cooled , is loose no longer . Nor do they require expensive surface restoration , because the surface is n't disturbed . Another kind of precision-made tunnel , and a marker of the changes taking place at Los Alamos , is the meson factory , a new linear accelerator of unique design that is just now being brought on line , a 858 million commitment to LASL 's future as a major scientific laboratory regardless of what happens to its weapons work . The meson factory 's energies are modest by comparison with the largest accelerators in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But the meson factory produces a beam of higher intensity ? of greater numbers of particles ? than any other accelerator in the world . In plain electrical terms , its amperage is high . " This facility is enormous , " says its director , a fifty-six-year-old physicist named Louis Rosen . " It is capable of exploring aspects of nature not heretofore explored . It will help bridge the gap between low-energy and high-energy physics . It 's also enormous in its practical applications . " One of those practical applications ? one presumably not lost on Congress ? is the capability to study some aspects of weapons development that have been studied in the past only through atmospheric and underground weapons testing . If and when the SALT talks yield a total test ban , the meson factory will help weapons scientists continue their work . Another practical application , which has received more publicity than all the others combined , is the use of the meson factory to treat cancer . Its treatment method is unique . The meson factory 's proton beam can be made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far greater than have ever been available before . Negative pions of known energy can be aimed precisely into a tumor , and , unlike every other type of radiation used for cancer treatment , they will deposit most of their dose of sterilizing radiation in the tumor , not in the healthy tissue at the entrance and the exit of the beam . They " select " the tumor because they give up most of their energy at the end of their travels , when they come to rest . not , as with other particles , more or less uniformly along the way . So they provide ' a. low entrance dose , a high tumor dose , and little or no exit dose . The tumor dose itself is the result of miniature , invisible nuclear explosions , and it is three times more effective than X rays at killing cancer cells . Rosen has already been flooded with letters , calls , and telegrams from cancer patients and their relatives , but the radiation-therapy facility is n't finished yet , and preclinical experiments will have to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may then justify itself from this operation alone . It will also be manufacturing large cp , autities of radioisotopes using the spent proton beam at the end of the line , a minor but important additional benefit to medicine . Moreover , even though the meson factory will be controlled by LASL , it is a national and even an international facility , available to any and all qualified scientists for research use . The Soviets and even the Red Chinese have already dropped in , and the image of citizens of the two leading Communist nations visiting Los Alamos , the best-kept secret of World War II , is compelling , although , as one scientist told me , " They do n't exactly wander around the place . " long-term solutions to the energy crisis that comes in a rather nice form without a large contamination problem . " Laser fusion is a program that grew out of weapons research . Scientists at the AEC laboratories are attempting to develop thermonuclear weapons that require no " dirty " fission reactions to trigger fusion ; lasers could supply the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miniaturized to bomb size remains to be seen . But the point is that if swords are being beaten into plowshares at Los Alamos , plowshares are also being beaten back into swords : weapons work still occupies far more energy and uses far more funds at Los Alamos than peaceful projects or basic research , and there is every reason to believe it will continue to . Yet there have been no really epochal breakthroughs in nuclear weaponry since the hydrogen bomb was developed and successfully reduced in size from the twenty-one-ton monstrosity set off at Eniwetok in 1952 to the modest poundage of a small rocket warhead today . So the question is , Where does all the money go ? Deadly statistics S OME OF IT GOES into designing replacements and improvements for existing warheads . Some of it goes into designing new systems , such as the Trident . But some of it goes into developing new kinds of weapons , and to put those efforts in perspective it 's useful to look at an informal , non-numerical inventory of our present weaponry that came to light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Applications of the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy held in April 1973 , under the chairmanship of Missouri Sen. Stuart Symington . Because the transcript of the hearings has not yet been published in full , and because of security deletions from its text , the inventory must be somewhat random , but it still offers a fair idea of our armaments . We have , witnesses testified , 1,050 ICBMs , located primarily in the Midwest . We have several thousand warheads deliverable from nuclear submarines . We have 397 B-52 bombers and sixty-six FB-111 fighter-bombers , and the B-52s are capable of carrying twenty-four bombs or missiles , although they usually carry fewer . The B-52 bombs include a new one , designated the B-61 , that has " a maximum yield of a few hundred kilotons " * and three other , lesser yields that can be selected in preference to the maximum yield by turning a dial . Our bombers sometimes carry , instead of bombs , numbers of a new nuclear missile , the SRAM , capable of Mach 4 speeds and maneuverable in flight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' " Compared with the Hiroshima bomb 's 20 kilotons. rives , and the bombers , have recently been subjected to varying degrees of limitation under the provisions of the Moscow accords . As yet uncontrolled are tactical weapons ? weapons intended to be used against opposing armies and navies , not against population centers . Among tactical weapons , we have several thousand warheads in the form of ground-toair and ground-to-ground rockets ? the Honest John , the Pershing , the Sergeant , the Lance . We have enough six- and eight-inch atomic cannon shells to feed 360 U.S. six-inch cannon , 324 NATO six-inch cannon , and 326 U.S. and NATO eight-inch cannon , and we are developing new , better-safeguarded plutonium shells for these cannon that will replace the present shells , which are ten and twenty years old , at a cost of some $900 million , less the recoverable cost ( some $375 million ) of the enriched uranium in the existing shells . We have , in addition , a glide bomb guided by a television camera in its nose , the Walleye , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ADMs ) , one that can be carried by one man , the other by vehicle . ADMs can gouge large craters in the ground ? to close a mountain pass to invading armies , for example , or force an advancing line of troops or tanks to funnel itself through an ADM-created narrows where it would be more vulnerable to other kinds of tactical nuclear weapons . We have air defense antiaircraft missiles ; we have torpedoes , depth bombs , and rockets for antisubmarine warfare , all of them with nuclear warheads . Yet despite the obvious extent of all this armament , we are somewhat less formidably armed today than we were a few years ago . According to Gen. Edward B. Giller of the United States Air Force , who testified at the hearing for the AEC , " the number of tactical weapons has been drifting down slowly . The number of air and missile defense systems has decreased quite dramatically from the mid-1960s and haE been replaced by an increase in the strategic system . The increase in strategic warheads i ! essentially the product @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war heads mounted on the same missile ; warhead ! smaller than the original and capable of being independently targeted , which makes them dif ficult to track ? MIRV stands for multiple in dependently targetable reentry vehicle . Th. maximum we have ever had in the United State was in 1965 . " Giller said our total megatonnag is also down : " In 1963 , we had tens of that : sands of megatons in stockpile . Since 197 ( we 've had several thousand megatons . This i mainly because we retired the big blockbuster from the Strategic Air Command aircraft , an the MIRVs carry smaller warheads than thei predecessors . " So the trend in weapons development in th past decade has been away from huge weapons and away from tactical weapons . Since the early 1960s , we have developed multiple warheads and long-distance submarine missile systems ; at the same time , through SALT , we have been working with the Soviet Union to bring our strategic systems under mutual limitation . And in so doing we have acted on the assumption , consciously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tactical nuclear war ; that once an opponent begins using tactical nuclear weapons , it can be only a matter of time before someone escalates to strategic nuclear weapons , and since both sides know that a strategic nuclear war is unwinnable , " it must follow that no one will attempt to fight a tactical nuclear war . 9- , HERE ARE INFLUENTIAL weapons men at Los I Alamos , and nuclear strategists in universities and at the Pentagon , who disagree with that argument . The weapons research budget at Los Alamos has been decreasing of late ? it has stayed much the same in dollars , but inflation has leached away some of its purchasing power a trend that presumably reflects the defense establishment 's satisfaction with the status quo . Yet LASL director Harold Agnew reported to the Military Applications Subcommittee that a " small but very elite group " of LASL people is ' working very aggressively " to influence the Department of Defense to consider funding development of a new kind of tactical weapon , ) . neutron-emitting antipersonnel weapon that , vould kill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weapon , one of limited effect and ) recise application , is what weapons people at , os Alamos are thinking about these days . I talked to one of those people , a thirty-sixrear-old Oklahoman named Charles Cremer. vith an M.S. in nuclear engineering from the Jniversity of Oklahoma , who joined LASL in 960 , has been in weapons development ever ince , and has now become , in the words of a , ASL press release , " one of the foremost weapris designers in the United States . " Cremer is roup leader for thermonuclear weapons deign in the Theoretical Design Division at Los Limnos . Three times during our interview he rought the conversation back to the same sub.ct : the possibility of designing weapons that re extremely limited in their effects . " There 's certainly a lot of effort going on , " e said , for example , " to see if we can design , isterns in which we achieve a military objective nd keep the rest of the effects confined as much 5 possible to that area . There are many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forces are capable , even if twoirds of them were lost , of the assured destruction nearly 50 percent of the Soviet population and any 80 percent of its industrial capacity . from a 100-kiloton ground-burst weapon and a few-kiloton airburst weapon . There 's as much difference between these two scenarios as there is between conventional weapons and a one-kiloton nuclear weapon . I venture to say that some very dramatic developments will take place over the next ten years of new types of capabilities for doing specific jobs . " In other words , Cremer and his associates are working to supply the U.S. Army with the explosive force , or the destructive radiation , of nuclear weapons without the unwanted side effects of nuclear weapons , without strategic damage . They are working to make weapons that the military can point to to prove that nuclear war , tactical nuclear war , is thinkable ( something , to be fair , that the Soviets are said to have believed from the beginning , although they have never put their beliefs into practice ) . They are working , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pined for , what the Navy enjoys , what the Air Force monopolizes : they are working to give the Army the bomb as a field option by putting the genie back in the bottle and using the bottle to hit the enemy over the head . Cremer argues that we have committed ourselves to a posture of either-or ? either total war or none at all . That posture , he says , is likely to become outmoded in the world of tomorrow when more and more countries have the bomb ( and more and more countries , as John McPhee has demonstrated in his recent , brilliant series in The New Yorker , are achieving the capability of making plutonium bombs ) , " We 've talked a lot about strategic systems , " says Cremer , " but there is another issue that concerns us ? with a true standoff as far as strategic exchanges are concerned , will any of the countries of the future want to try to engage us or one another at lower levels , and if they do , should n't we be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Cremer 's summing-up point is so extraordinary in its implications that I quote him at length : You 'd like to think that the world is going to be a very peaceful one in the years to come , and I think if we keep our heads about us it indeed will be . But I personally do n't believe we have reached a position where we can just forget about our defense posture . There are certainly some new challenges coming up in the future , and perhaps one of the key issues is the question of low-yield nuclear weapons and nuclear weapons of a type that are not really associated with massive destruction . And the decision may well not rest with this country as to whether those types of capabilities are an issue in hand or not . It may not even rest in twenty years with the Soviet Union and the United States . One thing I 'm very confident of , and that is , in the years ahead , the sharp break between the 63 so-called conventional warhead and the so-called nuclear warhead , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking , is going to get fuzzier and fuzzier and fuzzier , not only in terms of just yield , but also of what are the associated effects with these types of weapons . And so once again , one is going to come back to the fundamental question , which is , Can we develop a world in which we have no need for weapons ? You 've got to remember that even if the strategic standoff is complete , the room for adventuresome conventional forces could still be a serious threat . And a whole spectrum in between . What Cremer is conjuring up here is the possibility that conventional war may again become thinkable because of a complete strategic standoff , a standoff made official in the SALT talks . He is also describing the inevitable result of a technological bias that favors accuracy and elegance over sheer size . Having thoroughly explored one end of the weapons spectrum , the behemoth end , and found it wanting , we are now exploring the other end , and learning to make fine discriminations in size and effect . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cramer ominously concludes . Needless to say , the development of a new level , or several new levels , of nuclear weaponry is a vast development , one that could keep Los Alamos gainfully employed for a long time to come , working on a full spectrum that begins up there in the megatons and ends , where ? Nuclear handguns ? Plutonium bullets ? God forbid . The trouble with these new levels is that they return us , without due deliberation , to the belief that prevailed among military men before Hiroshima that nuclear weapons are no more than conventional weapons writ large . Even if you limit them , even if you control the effects from them that spill " off the battlefield , " the fact remains that they are not like conventional weapons in one crucialregard : however small they can be made , they can also be , and have been , made incredibly , lethally large , while still remaining portable enough to deliver . They are open-ended , and the use of one must very probably lead to the use of another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not so good . The sons of bitches just wo n't stop coming . " " Let 's try a bigger bomb . " But the argument for developing the new weapons is the same today as it was when the hawks fought Oppenheimer over the development of the H-bomb : if we do n't do it , someone else will . I asked all the mien I talked to at Los Alamos , weapons men and men working with peaceful applications , how they felt about the weapons work they were doing or had done . They all drew on traditional justifications for their answers , nor were any of them entirely comfortable with the question . They said that nuclear weapons had bought the world time for negotiation , though one of them , Norris Bradbury , an appealing , vigorous man who is the only living former director of the laboratory , remarked that he was " surprised it 's gone on so long . " They mentioned the Cold War , the balance of terror , the necessity to continue research in case the other side cheats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we surprised the world in 1945 . One young weapons designer , Charles F. Keller , a Ph.D . astrophysicist from Indiana University , said he wondered why the churches in Los Alamos do n't discuss the moral issues of weapons-making . He had , he said , raised the question in his own church , and the people he talked to there said they would n't dare hold such discussions because the subject was too volatile . In 1973 . But if they want to know , these intelligent , sensitive , and not at all dogmatic men , what their society thinks of their work , they need look no farther than their budgets . " The United States , " says Fred Ribe , " will have invested anywhere from $2 billion to $4 billion in the fusion program by the time we sew up the scientific problems in 1980 . And if that really confirms the feasibility of this energy source which will take care of mankind 's energy needs forever , it 's a terribly cheap investment . " By contrast , the United States spent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bombs , one to test , two to drop on Hiroshima and Nagasaki . and one to begin our huge stockpile , and we have spent uncounted billions since . Billion that make our investment in peaceful applica Lions look small , but perhaps that appearance i ! deceptive . I met no one at Los Alamos who wa ' a rabid cold warrior any longer , no one , Creme : included , who was enthusiastic for anythini more doomsday-like than the use of small weap ons for small purposes . In the almost catatoni world of nuclear weapons , that may be some thing like progress .
