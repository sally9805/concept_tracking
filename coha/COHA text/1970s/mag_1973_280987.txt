When Roy C. Satchell , 44 , quit as president of the Jos . Schlitz Brewing Co. after only six weeks on the job earlier this year , he explained : " I wanted to leave my mark , but the company was just too big , and I could n't do what I wanted . " Satchell , the second nonfamily president that Schlitz has ever had , also said : " When things do n't go the way I want , I go . " Over the years , he has gone from job to job-at Sinclair Oil , at Schlitz ( twice ) and at a construction-equipment business that he started . Next month Satchell will leave the Harvard Business School , where he has been an instructor for one semester , in order to plunge back into beer . He has been named chairman , president and chief executive of Theodore Hamm Co. , a 109-year-old St. Paul brewer . <P> Hamm has gone through five presidents in seven years . As much of the fiercely competitive U.S. beer market has been taken over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breweries , has fallen into the red . In the past two years , it has lost $3.7 million while annual sales have remained flat at about $140 million . Recently , Heublein , Inc. , which acquired Hamm for $63 million in 1965 , unloaded the company for a mere $6,000,000 to a group - i-  of Midwest beer distributors called Brewer 's Unlimited , Inc . The new owners called on Satchell to reorganize the company . He will say only that Hamm will be " less ambitious in terms of the market it serves . " About his own role , he is more emphatic . " I told them I wanted to do things my way , and they offered me a free hand . If they do n't give me the necessary freedom , it 's going to cost them a lot to get rid of me. "
