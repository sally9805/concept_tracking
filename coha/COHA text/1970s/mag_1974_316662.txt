Speeding without lights down a street near the White House at 2 o'clock one morning last week , the 1973 Lincoln Continental bore five people toward the Jefferson Memorial . Among them was an odd couple : an intoxicated , aging man with a badly scratched face and bloody nose and a hysterical , curvaceous woman . When police halted the car , the woman leaped out and jumped into the nearby Tidal Basin , a 10-ft. - deep estuary of the Potomac River . The man stumbled out after her , just before an officer dragged her to safety . When the police refused to let him drive her home , the man shouted : " I 'm a Congressman , and I 'll have you demoted . " <P> There were no arrests , but the tawdry scandal quickly became the talk of Washington , damaging a distinguished career and formerly impeccable reputation . The man was readily identified as Wilbur Daigh Mills , 65 , the 18-term Democrat from Arkansas who , as chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee , is one of Congress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be Mrs. Annabella Battistella , 38 , a bosomy stripper who used to style herself " Fanne Foxe , the Argentine Firecracker . " Now that the firecracker has exploded in Mills ' face , he just might lose his seat in Congress and along with it the chairmanship of what is widely regarded as one of the two or three most powerful House committees ; his successor as chairman would be Liberal Democrat Al Ullman of Oregon . <P> According to friends , Fanne formerly performed at the Silver Slipper , a sleazy Washington nightclub shoehorned between a pornographic bookstore and a pornographic theater . On the club 's window are photos of scantily clad women in provocative poses and a sign promising AN EXTRAVAGANZA OF BEAUTIFUL , CURVACEOUS GIRLS . Inside , dancers shake to the heavy beat of music thundering from amplifiers and strip to their G strings , as B-girls cadge $2.75 drinks from male customers . <P> Soon after she met Mills at the Silver Slipper in July 1973 , Fanne gave up her $500-a-week job and now has no visible means of support . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an apartment in Fanne 's luxury building , the Crystal Towers in Arlington , Va . According to club employees , Mills , usually with Fanne , visited the Silver Slipper about twice a month , where they sat at a small table near an emergency fire exit . Sometimes he ordered magnums of champagne for Fanne and drinks for the house , rarely less than $100 worth in a single evening and on one memorable occasion , it is said , $ 1,700 worth-paid for in cash . <P> Employees recalled that Mills and Fanne ended one evening with a loud quarrel when she decided that he was paying too much attention to a stripper named Vegas Vixen . Last week the women at the club seemed jittery about their notoriety . " Everybody 's nervous - we 're not supposed to talk : about it , " Natasha , a brunette with deep cleavage , whispered into a customer 's ear . <P> As the stories of the Congressman and Fanne swept Washington , Mills holed up in his apartment . At first his spokesman insisted that Mills had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skepticism on Capitol Hill . By Thursday , a still-cloistered Mills reluctantly issued a three-page statement admitting that he had been in the car after all , but claiming that the incident had been entirely innocent .
