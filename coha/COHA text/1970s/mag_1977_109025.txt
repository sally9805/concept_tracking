MIDWEST // The biggest news in the Southeastern Conference was not Tennessee 's upset of Kentucky . Far more significant was the miraculous escape of three Wildcats  --  Rick Robey , Larry Johnson and Dwane Casey  --  from an automobile crash . On the way to catch a flight to Auburn , Casey 's car skidded on an icy street , rolled down a 40-foot embankment and through a wooden fence . The car was totaled . None of the players was badly hurt , though , and Casey 's life may have been saved by Robey . As the car began to flip , Robey grabbed Casey , the driver , and yanked him to the floor .

Parkinson scored the first basket in the extra period to spur Purdue . Michigan geared up for this week 's showdown with Purdue by romping past Michigan State 83-70 in a game in which 51 personal fouls were called . // 1 . MICHIGAN ( 10-1 ) 2 . ALABAMA ( 14-0 ) 3 . TENNESSEE ( 12-2 ) // WEST // " My pet peeve is when home fans start leaving the Ute Arena before the game is over , especially when we are behind and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Guard Jeff Jonas . " I call it the Parking Lot Syndrome . " Noting that fans were exiting with 1:12 left and the Utes trailing Colorado State 61-54 , Jonas came up with a cure for the syndrome .

Oregon ended Washington 's 10-game winning streak 72-68 in overtime before losing to State 49-45 . Oregon State dumped the Cougars 61-58 and lost to Washington 90-76. // Against high-scoring Nevada-Las Vegas , North Arizona 's defense proved to be as leaky as the hull of a grounded oil tanker .

NEV. - LAS VEGAS ( 14-1 ) 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's John Kuester is a low-scoring guard who seldom fires away . Playing at Wake Forest , though , Kuester went on what was for him a scoring rampage , pumping in two jumpers in the waning moments to give the Tar Heels a 77-75 Atlantic Coast Conference victory . His accuracy was invaluable , for Carolina , which began the week with the best shooting percentage in the country ( .577 ) , shot only .448 . Further help came from Tommy LaGarde ( 22 points ) , Phil Ford ( 20 ) and freshman Mike O'Koren ( 14 rebounds ) .
