Harold Brown last week shared his thoughts on defense policy with TIME Correspondent Bruce Nelan . Excerpts : <P> <P> ON THE PENTAGON BUDGET . There are issues that need to be looked at-military pay and retirement programs , training programs , the rapid movement of the military from post to post , the creep upward into higher salary levels , the duplication between ourselves and our NATO allies on different systems . In every case where we are getting less for our money than we should be , there are historical , bureaucratic , political reasons for it . That 's the way democracy works . But it means that it 's hard to get these things out of the budget . <P> ON THE SOVIET ARMS BUILDUP . I suspect that bureaucratic , historical and service drives exist there too . It may be that those drives are creating this build-up . I think we should in every case look for possibilities for improving our own security by arms limitation discussions and agreements . But I think it would be a mistake for us to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NATO allies should pull up our socks and see whether by more efficient approaches , we can increase our own conventional strength . <P> ON STRATEGIC ARMS LIMITATION TALKS . The biggest achievement so far is the limitation of anti-ballistic missiles , and I would hate to see that jeopardized . We should work hard to get a second agreement . We should not feel under the pressure that if we do n't give in on some things by October when the 1972 SALT I treaty expires the world will come to an end or even that negotiations will . The talks have been snagged for months on how to deal with two new weapons : the U.S. cruise missile and the Soviet Backfire bomber . I would be willing to consider limiting cruise missiles under certain circumstances , but it depends on what you get for it and how the other side is limited . From what I read and see , the Backfire was not originally intended as a strategic arm against the U.S. The question for us is : Can it be used for strategic purposes ? <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain advantages-you can raise its readiness , which is a visible sign , and it can be recalled while a missile , once fired , can not . On the other hand , there are air defenses that make its attrition rate high , and it is vulnerable on the ground . Its big advantage is that it provides a different kind of penetration so that it complicates the other side 's problems . The question is : How much can you afford to pay for that , as compared with the other ways you could spend the funds ? <P> ON NUCLEAR WAR . Limited strategic war is almost impossible . Anyone who contemplates one is fooling himself if he thinks the chances are not overwhelming that it would become an all-out urban and industrial attack . <P> ON THE DEFENSE JOB . I have tried to retain a rational and analytical approach to things . That does not preclude full consideration of the nonquantifiable-the human , individual and political aspects of any problem .                @ @ @ @ @
