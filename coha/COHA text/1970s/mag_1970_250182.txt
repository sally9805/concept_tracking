When the results of the experiment were first reported last June , many scientists were outspokenly skeptical . University of Maryland Physicist Joseph Weber announced that after more than ten years of effort , he had finally detected the waves that transmit gravitational energy across space . These gravity waves had been postulated by Einstein 's General Theory of Relativity in 1916 but never before observed . Last week Weber converted many of the doubters . Over the last six months , he told the American Physical Society , he had recorded 200 distinct bursts of gravitational radiation from far out in space . <P> When Weber first detected gravity waves , he was unable to determine where they came from . Now , using his identical devices at College Park , Md. , and the Argonne National Laboratory outside Chicago ( TIME , June 20 ) , he seems to have closed in on the source . Roughly two-thirds of the waves were noted when the instruments were pointed toward the center of the Milky Way . Furthermore , the detectors picked up the waves even when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the galactic core . That phenomenon seemed to be still another verification of their existence : Einsteinian physics says that gravitational energy , unlike radio or light waves , should be able to pass through the most dense celestial bodies . <P> Unknown Processes . Physicists are hard pressed to account for the energy needed to generate even one of the outbursts recorded by Weber . They calculate that a wave could be produced by the equivalent of a hydrogen-bomb-like explosion in which twice the mass of the sun was converted entirely into energy . But at the rate that Weber 's gravity waves are occurring , so great a conversion of mass into energy would have long since consumed all of the hundred billion stars in the Milky Way galaxy . <P> One possible source of gravitational waves is the death of an ancient , massive star after its nuclear fires have burned out . No longer supported by its own radiant energy , it collapses violently , its density and gravitation becoming so great that it crushes itself out of existence . For all practical purposes , according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in space . But to produce waves on the scale observed by Weber , some 200 such stars would have to collapse every year in the Milky Way : scientists believe that the actual rate is only about one per year . Weber is equally puzzled . But the waves are there , he insists , " and the theorists will resolve the problem eventually . "
