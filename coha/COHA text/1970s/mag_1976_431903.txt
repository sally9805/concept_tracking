 | FOOD ADDITIVES : HOW SAFE IS SAFE ? LAST year , a food company , one of the world 's largest , stopped using a solvent known as trichloroethylene ( TCE ) in decaffeinating coffee . The minute traces of the chemical left in the coffee constituted , technically , a " food additive . " ( Additives are common , found in virtually every food we eat that does n't come from our own garden . ) At a cost of millions of dollars , the company converted to use of another chemical ? one that has not been tested in the same way as TCE ; it is not known if it is even as safe . Why ? A preliminary report on TCE by the National Cancer Institute had indicated that it caused cancer in the mice tested , when the dosage was large enough . Translated to the human diet , the dose could be achieved only by drinking about 50 million cups of the decaffeinated coffee a day , for 70 years . But , faced with alarmed consumers , the company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DES ) . In 1975 , for the second time , the Senate voted to ban its use as a growth stimulant in beef cattle . Some years ago , substantial doses of DES were prescribed by doctors to prevent miscarriage in pregnant women ; years later , in at least 125 cases , daughters of those women developed cancer of the vagina or cervix . Thus , DES is suspected of being a human carcinogen . As used by cattle feeders , however , DES is either added to the feed or implanted in a slow-release form in the ear of an animal . Residues in the beef , after the slaughtering , are minute . So small , in fact , that Thomas H. Jokes , a medical biochemist at the University of California , Berkeley , calculates that they pose a cancer risk fur less than one female among all those  | born in the United States every 133 years . ( This is lower than the cancer potential that women are exposed to from their own body 's estrogen , or from estrogens that occur naturally in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the benefits of using DES in beef cattle . Without DES or a substitute , the conversion of feed to lean meat is reduced by about to percent ? raising the cost of beef by some $10 a year per family . And to maintain U.S. beef production at its present level without DES or a substitute would require about five million additional tons of corn annually . Clause of Controversy . The specter of government banning hangs over every food additive , because of the 47-word Delaney Clause , included in the Food Additives Amendment passed in 1958 ? named for its author , Rep. James J. Delaney , of New York . Today it is one of the most controversial laws on our books . It specifies : " No additive shall be deemed to be safe if it is found to induce cancer when ingested by man or animal , or if it is found , after tests which are appropriate for the evaluation of the safety of food additives , to induce cancer in man or animal . " No one can quarrel with the aim . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consider to be testing requirements that go far beyond anything needed to establish reasonable safety , most foods cost more to make , and more to buy , than they otherwise would . One effect of the Delaney Clause , its opponents say , is that beneficial additives are prevented from being used ? as when cyclamates , a sugar substitute , were taken off the Food and Drug Administration 's approved food-additive list in 1969 . One result was the removal of many foods from the diets of millions of diabetics . The cost of the ban to the food industry was an estimated $115 million . Moreover , in direct response , saccharin prices increased . ( Needless to say , it 's the consumer who usually pays the , bill in the end . ) Ironically , subsequent studies have shown that cyclamates in the amounts used in food have no harmful effect ? yet they still remain off the FDA-approved list . Complex Combinations . Food additives include everything from cyclamates to many of the ancient spices sought by explorers like Marco Polo . They are used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life , safety or nutritional quality of the food to which they ' are added . Today , the American diet contains some 3000 such additives ? though just 30 of them account for 8o percent of the to pounds or so the average person consumes yearly . They constitute less than one percent of the total diet , yet perform a host of vital functions . " Food additives such as anti-oxidants in canned vegetables and fruits slow down chemical deterioration , " says Elizabeth M. Whelan , public-health specialist and co-author of Panic in the Pantry . " Such natural foods as rye , wheat 118  | ' and sweet potatoes could cause serious health problems if not treated with preservatives . Further , the addition to foods of vitamins C and D and iodide has all but eliminated scurvy , rickets and goiter . The addition of nitrites to meat and fish during the curing process has been responsible for control of botulism . " Butylated hydroxyanisole ( BHA ) , for example , is widely used to retard spoilage in peanut , corn and bakery products . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shelf life of one year ; without it , only four months . BHA thus allows longer production runs , less waste , and lower costs to the consumer . There is even evidence associating use of BHA with a significant drop in stomach cancer . Critics say that food additives are chemicals , therefore unnatural and dangerous . " Actually , " responds Whelan , " we know more about those chemicals than we do about the chemistry of food itself . Food additives have survived rigid testing procedures not applied to the great majority of natural products . " Food itself is simply a complex combination of chemicals , many of them never identified . A potato , for example , contains some 150 different chemicals , including solanine , oxalic acid , arsenic , tannins and nitrates . Solanine in particular can be highly toxic . Says Whelan , " The average American , consuming 119 pounds of potatoes a year , ingests 9700 milligrams of solanine ? enough to kill a horse , if taken in a single dose . " Some so-called " health foods " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theFDA as a food additive ( and now removed from the tea ) because it causes can . cer in animals . Even spinach contains high levels of nitrates , which can become nitrites . These are currently under investigation for their role in the formation of carcinogens because they are used in curing ham , bacon , hot dogs . In fact , if the Delaney Clause were applied to all foods , instead of just to additives , it would probably ban half of the world 's food supply . Commensurate Risks . The FDA has reported on certain ingredients it banned because they induced cancer in laboratory animals , and because sufficient proof of safety in humans was lacking : ? Cyclamate ? A 12-ounce bottle of diet soda may have contained from one-quarter to one gram of sodium cyclamate . To get an amount comparable to that which caused effects in mice and rats , an adult would have to drink from 138 to 552 such bottles per day . ? Oil of Calamus ? a flavoring additive . To get an amount comparable to that which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drink 250 quarts of vermouth per day . ? Safrole ? a flavoring used in root beer . A person would have to drink 613 bottles ( 12-ounce ) of the soft drink , or eat 220 pounds of hard candy flavored with it , per day , to get an amount comparable H9  | to that which caused effects in rats . Such extrapolations seem absurd . But the Delaney Clause bans food additives , no matter how minute , which might cause cancer in animals or man ? no matter how large the known benefits to human health or well-being , and no matter how small the risk potential . " I think animal studies are indispensable as a way to estimate relative risks . But , I can not agree that we should discard a flavor or a color on account of any risk , no matter how slight , " says Nobel Prize-winning geneticist Prof. Joshua Lederberg . " There simply is no way to assure that the risk of any substance or process is really zero . The reasonable question to ask is whether the benefits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risk to health . " Safe Dose ? Scientists are in sharp disagreement on just what constitutes a proper test where cancer is concerned . The nub of the disagreement is whether or not there is a threshold level below which a substance can not cause cancer . " Sola dosis facit venenum " has for centuries been the rule of toxicology . " Only the dose makes a poison . " Even arsenic can not be classed categorically as a poison , for in small quantities it is used as a therapeutic agent . Curare , the deadly poison of certain South American Indians , has found a role in medicine as a muscle relaxant , and digitalis , the heart stimulant , has saved thousands more lives than it ever threatened in its natural form as the poisonous plant foxglove . Naturally occurring poisons have always existed in our foods ? as well as in our water , air and body tissues . Cyanide is found in apricot jam , arsenic in shrimp , methyl alcohol in wine . But in such infinitesimal quantities that only recently have new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Delaney Clause was passed , 50 parts per million was considered the practical equivalent of zero . Then scientists became able to measure in parts per billion . ( One part per billion is the equivalent of one inch in i6,000 miles , or one minute in 2000 years . ) Today , scientists can measure in parts per trillion . Unfortunately , there has been no comparable increase in our ability to determine at just what level a potential toxin ( or an additive ) becomes a danger . Even the most toxic chemical , toxicologists state , has a safe dose , a level of exposure at which it produces no effect because the body isolates , excretes or changes it into a non-toxic form . Only when the level exceeds the body 's capacity for defense will effects occur . But does the chemical have a cumulative effect ? Certain chemicals are stored unchanged in the system , and may build up to a toxic level . Also to be considered : because of subtle differences in metabolism , the chemical may be poisonous in humans though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is on such points that interpreta-120 1976 FOOD ADDITIVES : HOW SAFE IS SAFE ?  | tions of the Delaney Clause become hopelessly snarled . Tests on animals are generally used to determine whether or not a substance is carcinogenic . But dose levels in such testing are so high that some experts question if the results are truly applicable to humans . They maintain that ? as with poisons ? there is a level beneath which even the most potent carcinogen poses no threat . Other experts say that even the smallest amount has its effect and , to the susceptible person , the minutest quantity may be lethal . " Perhaps there is a threshold level below which we can be sure a carcinogen will have no effect , " says biochemist John Cooper of the National Cancer Institute . " But I do n't know how to establish it ? not for a diversified population including babies , pregnant women , sick elderly men and healthy young adults . " Illusory Goal . And so the argument continues to rage . For , as it stands , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that of absolute safety . " Nothing can be absolutely free of risk , " says Harvard biochemist William W. Lowrance , author of Acceptable Risk : Science and the Determination of Safety . " One ca n't think of anything that is n't , under some circumstances , able to cause harm , ' Should the Delaney Clause , then be retained , modified , or repealed ' If it were dropped , many expert , contend , the public would he just a. , well protected by other existing law ? specifically , the Food Additives Amendment of 1958 to the earlier Food , Drug , and Cosmetic Act . Sev eral attempts at modification have failed . Given the emotional feelings that surround the subject of cancer , the Delaney Clause has become some thing of a sacred cow . Still , insisting on an unachievable and illusory goal , it sets an unreasonable stand and of safety for additives ? one that we demand for no other food prod ucts , practices or services . Certainly the public must be pro tected . But the Delaney Clause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and capa bilities of 1976 . A new version could require that each fio I additive be examined on an individual basis , weighing benefits against potential risks . It could provide for the comparison of man made additives with natural ones having an equal potential for toxicity , in order to establish some points of reference on nature 's own scale . Then perhaps we would be able to combine safety with reason . @#
