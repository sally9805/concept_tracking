Enrique Ponce , a construction laborer from El Puente , Calif. , and Michael Ward , a resident physician at the University of California Hospital in Los Angeles , exemplify two reasons that a federal program to guarantee loans to needy students is in deep trouble . Ponce borrowed $1,500 from a trade school that offered to teach him to become a TV repairman , but dropped out after two weeks because he found the courses too difficult . The school by then had already sold the loan to a credit union , which is now trying to collect the $1,500 from the Government . Dr. Ward and his wife Cheryl , a lawyer , declared themselves bankrupt at the start of their careers and thus unable to repay $32,000 in student loans , so the Government was stuck with that bill too . <P> Neither experience is uncommon . Under the Federally Insured Student Loan ( FISL ) program , the Government since 1965 has directly guaranteed repayment of almost $4 billion in loans made to students by banks or other lenders-often schools themselves . All students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Students are charged no more than 7% annual interest ; the Government pays as much as 3% more to make the interest rate competitive with that of other kinds of loans . Repayment begins nine months after a student 's graduation . <P> Default Rate . In addition , the Government has reinsured student loans of about $4.9 billion guaranteed by 25 states , the District of Columbia and one private nonprofit agency ; Washington reimburses the states for 80% of any money they lose paying off defaulted loans . To date , the Government has lost nearly $400 million on the two programs ; states have apparently lost almost $47 million more . And the losses are mounting ; this year the default rate on student loans guaranteed by Washington is running at a startling 19% . <P> Why ? According to testimony taken by the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations , about half of last year 's losses involved specialized or technical schools , most of them privately owned and operated for profit . Such schools have burgeoned since FISL began , in large part because the Office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Welfare , which administers FISL , has allowed many of them to lend to their students directly . Although many of these " proprietary " schools do a valuable job of educating , others victimize both their students and the Government . In too many cases , a high-pressure salesman working on a commission basis recruits students from low-income backgrounds by offering career-improving courses to be financed by federally guaranteed loans . Many of the students quickly drop out , but the school neglects to inform anyone that they have left . The dropouts , of course , do not feel obliged to pay for an education they never received , so the Government is left to pay the school or an institution that has bought the loan . " It 's a field day for foxes , " says Richard Gibbons of the Federal Trade Commission . Last year the default rate on student loans made by privately owned schools was a shocking 46.3%.
