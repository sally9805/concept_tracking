Loss for inflation fighters <P> While Jimmy Carter was waging his diplomatic offensive in Europe , his home front troops continued to lose ground last week in the campaign against inflation . Barry Bosworth , chief of the Council on Wage and Price Stability , repeated that inflation will not be slowed until pay increases in major union settlements decline to 7% , from 10% in recent contracts . But 13 railway unions were busy wrapping up a much richer pact . <P> Four of the unions , covering 340,000 of the nation 's 496,000 railway workers , signed a " memo of understanding " for a threeyear , 35% increase in wages and cost of living allowances . John Sytsma , president of the Locomotive Engineers , declared that his members had shown " admirable restraint " because they had originally asked for a 45% raise . Said Sytsma : " It 's not quite fair to make labor the whipping boy for inflation . " <P> Once again , Administration officials tried to say that this labor settlement would be an " exception , " because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ management 's offers were already on the table . In fact , the talks had been going on for ten months before the Wage and Price Council began to preach moderation . Bosworth , speaking with a refreshing candor that may start getting him into trouble , said the Administration had " fumbled , " adding , " This negotiation is one that got away from us . " <P> There can be no such excuses or explanations for the other pace-setting labor negotiation of 1978 , covering 570,000 postal workers . Those talks should come to a climax this week , and Bosworth 's jaw-boners have been in on them from the start . The unions demand a 14% increase in the first year of a two-year contract , well above the 5.5% that the Administration has recommended for federal employees . Postal workers already earn an average of $8 an hour , vs. $5.51 for private nonfarm workers , and they enjoy a " no layoff ' clause that the Postal Service wants to modify but the union seems determined to preserve . <P> Some 4,000 postal workers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1970 , demonstrated noisily in front of Postal Service headquarters in Washington . Waving placards reading NO CONTRACT , NO WORK , they threatened to defy federal law and walk out if a settlement is not reached by the deadline this Thursday . <P> Carter 's inflation fighters can not afford another grossly inflationary settlement , after having lost earlier this year on the mine workers and then the railway men . If postal workers do , in fact , win a fat raise , it would not only lead to higher postage rates , but leave no hope of holding the line on the Teamsters , the Auto Workers , the Electrical Workers and Building and Construction Trades unions next year . <P> One top Administration official concedes that the White House does not have real links or leverage with labor . Says he : " We have much better lines to businessmen . They seem more willing to talk and to act , up to a certain point . Labor is more suspicious and thinks that we 're antilabor . We 're trying to improve our ties to labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
