Slowly but surely , Turkey , which already has about 40% of Cyprus , seems determined to nibble away at the remaining 60% . With no real opposition from the outgunned Greek Cypriot National Guard , Turkish forces last week advanced their lines another twelve miles to the southwest , taking command of Morphou Bay , the main exit point for the island 's copper production . <P> The Turkish general staff , indeed , seemed independent even of Premier Blent Ecevit 's civilian government , adamantly vetoing any suggestion from Ankara that Greek refugees be allowed to return home until a permanent political solution had been worked out . " It is not because we want to impose anything on the Prime Minister , " said a high-ranking military man . " But we are the people responsible for the lives of Turkish soldiers and Turkish Cypriots . We can not take the risk . " <P> The Turks ' hard-lining stand was bolstered by the discovery of a mass grave at the village of Maratha in eastern Cyprus , with 84 crumbling corpses ; the village @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kemal Mustafa described it , Greek gunmen entered Maratha Aug. 14 , herded away elderly men , women and children and shot them . The number of victims was confirmed by Swedish United Nations officers . Greek authorities rather unconvincingly said that the corpses might be Greek Cypriots instead of Turkish-a suggestion that the Turks angrily denounced as an " added insult to our grief . " Later , the Greeks countered with charges that the Turks had also committed atrocities ; they brought forth a Greek building contractor , Andreas Stylianouv , who said that he had survived the massacre of 30 Greek prisoners of war , also on Aug. 14 . <P> Unfortunately , both sides may be right , but the mutual anger only delays an end to the island 's continuing misery . <P> Cypriot Greek and Turkish leaders last week agreed to exchange 4,500 prisoners as well as lists of missing persons . But in Geneva , where Greece and Turkey had been holding broader talks before last month 's renewed Turkish offensive , there was no sign of a resumption of discussions . The Greeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forthcoming . <P> The Greeks , in fact , would just as soon transfer the talks to New York , where they feel that they will have support when the U.N . General Assembly begins its session on Sept. 23 . Greece and Britain , as co-guarantors with Turkey of Cyprus ' independence , claim somewhat extravagantly that a solution actually rests not with either Turkey or <P> Greece but with the U.S. Both Athens and London-the first publicly , the second privately-believe that Washington has been laggard in using its persuasive abilities . Says a high British official : <P> " There is only one power that can move the Turks-the U.S. "
