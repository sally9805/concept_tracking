ON OSCAR HAMMERSTEIN II . Oscar taught me that a song should be like a little one-act play , with an exposition , a development and a conclusion ; at the end of the song the character should have moved to a different position from where he was emotionally at the beginning . This was how Hammerstein and Dick Rodgers revolutionized the American theater . I mean , God knows every opera composer dating back to Monteverdi knew about development , but it was never used in the musical theater . <P> ON COLE PORTER . He wrote a valid but entirely different kind of song , in which you take a particular idea and play with it and develop it in terms of cleverness , wit , intellectual or romantic intensity . Essentially , Porter 's songs restate ideas over and over again ; he was just better at it than the others of his period . <P> <P> ON LORENZ HART . Most people think that Hart is one of the two or three best lyric writers this country has ever known . I find him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the music properly . When he is just futzing around with words , he does n't even do it neatly . He misaccents words . One example is in Pal Joey , the line in Take Him : " I know a movie executive/ Who 's twice as bright . " It 's a good joke , but you do n't misaccent a word if you want to write a good lyric . Technically it 's deficient and to my ear unprofessional . <P> ON RHYMING . Clever rhyming is easy . To rhyme orange is no trick at all . Anybody can do it . You can say <P> an orange , or a porringer . <P> Hammerstein said that the really difficult word to rhyme is a word like day , because the possibilities are so enormous . One of the things I 've learned is that the way to get a laugh in a song is not through the cleverness of the rhyme but by what you 're saying . The biggest laugh in Forum is the line in the warriors ' song : " I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not mine , it 's Plautus ' . <P> ON LYRICS AND POETRY . Poetry exists in its conciseness , how much is packed into it ; it 's important to be able to read and reread it at your own speed . Lyrics exist in time , second to second to second . Therefore lyrics always have to be underwritten . You can not expect an audience to catch more than the ear is able to catch at the tempo and richness of the music . The perfect example of this is Oh , What a Beautiful Morniri , the first part of which I 'd be embarrassed to put down on paper . I mean , you just do n't put down <P> Oh , what a beautiful mornin ' <P> , Oh , what a beautiful day . . . <P> <P> It 's just ridiculous . What Oscar knew was that there was music to go with it . The minute that Dick Rodgers ' music is added , the whole song has an emotional weight . I really think that Oklahoma ! ran seven years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
