More on the test-tube birth <P> After the birth of the world 's first test-tube baby in Britain last July 25 , little Louise Brown 's scientific godfathers , Gynecologist Patrick Steptoe and Physiologist Robert Edwards , were sharply criticized by some American colleagues for failing to reveal all the details of their pioneering work . Last week Steptoe put the critics to rest . At a meeting in San Francisco of the American Fertility Society , the British researcher delivered an hour-long lecture on the birth of Baby Brown and other hitherto unpublicized facets of the British pair 's research . The talk had a dramatic effect . Rising to their feet , the 1,200 doctors and biomedical specialists gave Steptoe a rousing ovation . Said Society President Dr. S. Jan Behrman : " We now know what he did . No one can say that he fudged it . " <P> In his presentation , Steptoe revealed that he and Edwards had made 32 attempts between November 1977 and August 1978 to implant embryos conceived in a laboratory dish into a mother 's womb . Four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the birth of healthy children-Louise Brown and , on Jan. 14 in Scotland , Alastair Montgomery . Both were premature , Steptoe said , but now are " flourishing , normal babies . " <P> The other two pregnancies were ended by spontaneous abortions . One occurred as late as the 20th week of pregnancy , apparently as a result of an accidental rupture of the membranes surrounding the infant . The baby boy was normal but not yet mature enough to live outside the womb . He died two hours later . The other abortion took place at eleven weeks because of a fatal chromosomal , or genetic , abnormality in the fetus . <P> Steptoe believes the premature births of the two living children and the loss of the other two babies are not related to the method of conception . He notes that the mothers were under tremendous stress and that the chromosomal imbalance occurs in naturally conceived pregnancies as well . Hence , while he acknowledges that test-tube fertilization needs further refining , he says that " the method is no longer experimental . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctors have thus far been stalled in undertaking similar research under what amounts to a five-year-old federal moratorium on such experiments with human eggs and sperm . But soon the researchers may be allowed to get back to work . An ethics advisory board appointed by HEW Secretary Joseph Califano has tentatively agreed that the ban should be lifted and proposed guidelines for the work . The board will take a formal vote on its recommendations next month . -
