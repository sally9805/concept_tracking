DEAR SIRS : Joseph A. Ruskay refers to the Rev. Billy Graham as a sort of " unofficial chaplain " to the White House family " New Muzzle for Churchmen , " The Nation , Oct. 2 . Chaplains generally are apologists and stool pigeons for the military.I As a veteran ; so it seemed to me during World War II . I prefer to think of Billy Graham as a Rasputin of the White House , an ersatz Christian giving aid and comfort to an ersatz Quaker . , . . John C. Rogers government in shreds Los , Angeles , Calif . DEAR SIRS : At the height of the ITT scandal , the Adminisi tration ordered the shredding of all pertinent memoranda . A news item in the Los Angeles Times has just revealed that the Administration also directed the shredding of relevant documents when the Watergate scandal broke : At this very moment , one might conclude , the Administration is probably shredding data connected with the wheat-forRussia scandal . This later , ongoing hanky-panky will henceforth be known as " The Shredded Wheat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pa . DEAR Sins : I am fed up with the public , opinion pollsters , those seers of the computer who grant us their ex cathedra revelations nearly every day now . A fine situation for a democracy : one-millionth or two-millionths of the population speak for the whole ! Common rumor is raised to respectability ; idle speculation becomes scientific truth . . . . If he were alive today , John Stuart Mill would be driven to desperation ; Henry David Thoreau would be nauseated . ? . . Then there is the implied ad populorum morality of the polls ( e.g. , 55 per cent approve bombing , therefore it is right ) . If pollthink is already here , can 1984 be far behind ? J.

DEAR SIRS : Grateful as I am for the reporting of Robert Sherrill , I must say that I regret the German parentheses scattered through his article on the Watergate affair The Nation , Sept. 25 , the implications of which seem to me utterly loose and irresponsible . If the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is something specifically and exclusively Germanic or Fascist about their activities , then Mr. Sherrill should say so plainly . Your indulgence of such cheap and oppressive insinuations ( as if in imitation of the Nixon Administration ) is disappointing . Wendell Berry Mexico 's need Euclid , Ohio DEAR SIRS : The most meaningful section of Jim Hougan 's essay on Mexico 's counter-culture The Nation , Sept. 25 is his implicit demonstration that the long accepted " eco-nomic miracle of Mexico " is a vanished fantasy , one , really , that never existed except as a fantasy . I had pursued this contention throughout the regime of Diaz Ordaz , and The Nation published a number of my articles on that subject . At that , time they must have appeared somewhat far out because of the continuous impressive national economic growth statistics . But the intrinsic fact of life was ( Continued on page 373 ) EDITORIALS CAMPAIGN ' 72 ' This Lawless Administration ' The Washington Post apologizes for resorting to the word " rancid " ? which it rarely uses except when dealing with environmental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Department of Dirty Tricks . " These now extend well beyond the Watergate case and involve such " tricks " as forged letters leaked to the press , general surveillance of Democratic candidates , attempts to disrupt meetings and similar gang-style antics . ? Consider these developments : ( 1 ) Alfred C. BaldWin III , former FBI agent and key witness in the Watergate case , is induced to tell his story to two investigative reporters for the Los Angeles Times : Jack Nelson and Ronald J. Ostrow . The Times paid him nothing ; he simply decided to talk . His attorneys then , urged the , Times not to run the story , but only after Earl Silbert , Chief Assistant to the U.S. Attorney in Washington , D.C. ? the man in charge of the Watergate case  --  had phoned them to say that Baldwin might be cited for contempt , or the government might revoke his immunity if the interview were published . The Times decided to go ahead . ( 2 ) Then a " gag order " was obtained from chief U.S. District @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case to himself as  --  under the rules  --  the judge best qualified to handle it . The sweeping order ; since modified , was issued a day after Silbert had filed motion papers agreeing to a week-old request for such an order by attorneys for E. Howard Hunt , Jr. , a former White House aide and one of the defendants in the case . Silbert filed these papers on the same day he learned of the Times interview from Baldwin 's attorneys . By clear inference , the order was aimed at the suppression of the interview , and the Times , a strong Republican paper , so denounced it in a stinging editorial . ( 3 ) Asked to make " a clean breast " of the facts surrounding the Watergate case , the President told reporters that the FBI had assigned 133 agents to the case , purSued 1,800 leads , and conducted 1,500 interviews ( note those round figures ) . What more could be asked ? Why , the Alger Hiss investigation was " basically a Sunday school exercise " by comparison . True , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what they can find out or also trying to decide what others might find out , given the chance ? The fact is , as Rep. Wright Patman has said , that the President is " totally responsible " for what the committee to re-elect him has done and is doing . As to the FBI under Gray , one of its limousines was used in New York , Weeks after John Mitchell had resigned , to chauffeur Martha Mitchell to a series of campaign meetings . Even Gray concedes the action was " improper . " Also slightly rancid . Does any of this disturb the electorate ? George Gallup . says , " No , not much . " Perhaps an outsider 's view might help voters see what is involved . Henry Fairlie , conservative Washington , correspondent for the Tory Spectator , . offers some pertinent comments : I am among those . . . who believe that Richard Nixon is the chieftain of , a lawless Administration , and that its lawlessness will significantly increase during a second term in which hope of re-election is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other ? day by day , as it seems  --  are not unconnected incidents . This lawless Administration is bound to behave scapdalpusly , it is of its nature , it is how it is made . . . . The simple truth IS that the Republican Party as it exists today under the leadership of Richard Nixon believes that there is no form of political power which it is not entitled to purchase , and it believes that all ' political power can be purchased ; in fact , that everyone has his price . In this belief it is utterly cynical . . . . From the ITT case . . . to the ever more complicated revelations surrounding the bugging of the Democratic Party 's headquarters , the present Administration is carrying the exercise of corruption to a level of lawlessness which is intolerable . It is bad enough that it should have , and that it should intend to spend $45 million on the reelection of the President alone ; but the manner of the spending , as it is revealed from day'to day , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may begin to wonder what such an Administration , having bought its way lawlessly to power , might then consider itself entitled to do during a second term in which power was virtually unchecked . But ' a large section of the electorate apparently does not agree . Why ? In quest of an answer I visited a friend who ' is a big wheel in a Wall Street firm that does a huge business as a wholesaler of stocks and securities . As computers whirred and squads of young swingers answered jangling phones , and hurried here and there with bits of paper in a miniature Stock Exchange setting , I was given " the view from the Street . " Nixon , it seems , has " fixed " the election by playing auctioneer for the major interest groups , , labor , industrial ; financial , agricultural , religious , ethnic ( only the blacks are excjuded ) . The President is proving himself to be a fine Political Salesman : he has sold i Boeing airliners , to the Chinese and wheat to the Russians and has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world . European and American banks are eager to finance such transactions ; the credit of the Russians is good , they have a lot of oil and gas . In brief , American and European capitalists have finally grasped the cardinal fact that communism is one means by which " backward " nations can , in , the giant step of one generation , become splendid purchasers of Western-made products . Since their peoples want what ours want or already have , the Soviets are not only willing but compelled to enter the auction on a huge scale . A , majority of the electorate would vote , therefore , for the Salesman not because they like him or trust him or because they approve of Watergate or like all of his domestic deals , but because his present policies promise to pay off handsbmely . No doubt they will , but who will be the chief beneficiaries ? Similar sentiments are reflected ' in the October newsletter sent out by . Harris , Upham &; Co. which assures the firm 's clients that " corruption is as American as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recently , to get " uptight about . " Such a version of Campaign ' 72 represents not " mood " analysis but market analysis . The Salesman has analyzed the market and is telling his client constituents that he has found some hungry customers . The old " anti-Communist rhetoric is filed for the season ; now we are all , proprietors of the world 's biggest supermarket , stocked with goodies gaudily packaged . If the electorate sees itself that way , then it would seem that Senator McGovern was somewhat off the mark when he charged the Administration with " corruption . " The charge would seem to fit the clients as well as it does the salesman . But is n't the price a bit steep ? Forget the price tag ; some " prices " can not be measured in dollars and cents . When politics has been reduced to a crude commodity exchange , accompanied by threats and retaliations against the opposition , what then is the effect on the values  --  such intangibles as anticipations , shared assumptions , traditional goals and aspirations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " equal protection " ? which alone hold a society together . Such values can not be purchased or traded on the market ; if destroyed they can not be restored . The public interest is not necessarily synonymous With a majority 's conception of its economic iself-interest at a particular moment in time . " Security " can not be ' achieved by building high-rise fortresses ; if the values which alone , in the last analysis , hold a society together , finally disintegrate , then every citizen 's security is threat-t ened . To say this is not to " moralize " ? a dirty word these days . It is merely to remind voters of their real self-interest , which is perceived so sharply and vividly by Henry Fairlie , the friendly British observer . George Meany 's whip cracking is not cowing the affiliates of AFL-CIO as it might have done in years past . Thanks to the spirited leadership of Herrick Roth ( see comments on p. 357 ) , long a thorn in Meany 's side , the membership of the Colorado Labor Council @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a local federal district judge has denied Meany 's petition to place the council in trusteeship . In California , where labor is more united behind McGovern than elsewhere , the State Federation elected to take the position that Meany 's " neutrality " did not preclude it from denouncing Nixon . Here , too , Meany has attempted to crack down . ' The federation has countered by calling a special session of the Committee of Political Action for October 19 at which Meany 's ukase will be reviewed . The Massachusetts State c ' Labor Council has overwhelmingly approved a resolution calling for the defeat of Nixon and the virus of insubordination is spreading . Eleven state councils have now protested in one way or another and expressed support for McGovern . Large sections of labor are annoyed not only by the farce of Meany 's " neutrality " but also by his arrogance and sycophancy . Meany and his wife attended the Columbus Day banquet in Washington sponsored by some Italian-American organizations at which Mr. Nixon presented the sponsors ' " man-of-the-year " award to Peter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ North - America . Fosco was eligible in that he is of Italian-American background , but it is difficult to detect , in his long career in the labor movement , the precise civic virtues which incited the admiration of the sponsoring organizations . After mentioning Meany and Fosco by name , the President went on to say that when he has a difficult decision to make , such as the decisions to bomb North Viet- ) nam and mine its harbors , it is nice to have labor leaders around who will pick up the phone and say , " We will give you support . " To pursue the semblance of Meany 's " neutrality , " Mrs. Meany was the member of the family photographed with the President , and her husband 's presence was played down in the press . Meany 's decision to support Nixon will have a continuing impact long after the election . Not only has he cast himself in the Quisling-like role of Nixon 's " labor front " but he has consolidated the opposition to his leadership , which is now beginning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MCWILLIAMS The Perils of Disowriment Men and women who serve in line organizations , if properly treated , are inclined to be loyal in turn . Since loyalty begets loyalty , they can be relied on to " clam up " when trouble brews and stand by their bosses and the organization . The ITT scandal is an example . After some initial wavering , the lady lobbyist backed ' up her bosses and , with the aid of its.shredding machine , ITT weathered the storm fairly well . But each such narrow escape exacts a price . Underlings , , even those not given to thinking overtime , begin to think . By now , great numbers of them have tumbled to the fact that on occasions of organizational embarrassment , or worse , they may be left holding the bag . When things go wrong , in business and in government , hanging the blame on some minor employee is a practice as old as bureaucracy itself . The ultimate safeguard of the subordinate  --  even of a very high subordinate  --  is to " talk . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way of getting back at the organization which , as the prospective victim sees it , has ratted on him . A prime case is that of Gen. John D. Lavelle , accused of parrying on a private war against unauthorized targets in North Vietnam . The White House had approved " protective-reaction " strikes in North Vietnam . The often advertised " unarmed reconnaissance airplanes " were flying over the-terrain , selecting future targets , and accompanied by well-armed fighter-bombers . If any aircraft encountered surface-to-air fire , it and all the other fighter-bombers were authorized to return the fire . That , of course , was a fine way to locate North Vietnamese air defenses while staying within instructions , but it was n't enough for Lavelle . He planned , and his pilots carried out , general bombing missions against more tempting targets , using bombs as large as 1,000 pounds . Many Air Force people of various grades were involved in the flights and in filing false mission reports . An intelligence specialist , grade of sergeant , home town Cedar Rapids , Iowa , was assigned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a letter to Iowa Sen .. Harold Hughes telling him what was up . Hughes sent a copy to Gen. John Ryan , Air Force Chief of Staff . General Ryan realized immediately that th &; fat was in the file and dispatched his inspector , general to Saigon . In the ensuing investigation , General Lavelle , according to Sen. John C. Stennis , chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee , was less than candid . He could hardly have been expected to be frank in the situation in which he found himself . He testified that he had not ? directly ordered the falsification of any specific reports and , taken literally , that was probably true , although some of his subodinates contradicted him . A four-stpr general can make his wants known elliptically and everybody down the line will give him what he wants . By the same token , the Joint Chiefs of Staff did not order Lavelle in so many words to bomb beyond the formal directives ; but it strains credulity to suppose that an officer , - however zealous , would on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , embark on such a venture . When he saw that he was cast in the role of the scapegoat , Lavelle wrote a long letter to Senator Stennis , insisting that he had been encouraged by the Joint Chiefs and by Defense Secretary Melvin Laird to do what he did . This leaves hanging the crucial question : did Laird and the Joint Chiefs so encourage Lavelle on the orders , or at the suggestion , of the President ; or did ' the Joint Chiefs and Laird take it on themselves to disobey those orders ? Either the American people were deceived by their President , or the President was deceived by his military advisers . ' Then there is the case of Alfred C. Baldwin III , recounted by Jack Nelson of the Los Angeles Times . According to his story , Baldwin was cast of , for the role o the patsy in the Watergate bugging case . He says that an attorney for the Committee for the Re-election of the President told him , " You 're not to say anything . Your position ' is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Not so long ago You were a " Communist " if you even whispered that the Constitution contained an amendment to which a witness could resort in refusing to incriminate himself before an investigating body . Now respectable Republicans find the amendment handy . Baldwin , however , elected to talk , . and thus the committee ? CREEP , as they call it in Washington  --  finds itself over a barrel . And , there , are others , such as John and Martha Mitchell , particularly the latter , who might in their memoirs tell all they know about Watergate . That could include even Richard Nixon . Development ? ? ? For Whom ? As the head of the World Bank , Robert S. McNamara knows what he is talking about when he publicizes the " direct and constant relationship between the incidence of violence and the economic status of the countries afflicted . " He said that in 1966 , and , the news is even worse today . Addressing the board of governors of the World Bank Group on September 25 , McNamara reported on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and endihg next ' June 30 , and the prospects for the fiscal years 1974-78 . The latter are extremely dubious . The developed countries were to increase their assistance to 0.7 per cent of their GNPs by 1975 . The actual figure will be half of that-0.37 per cent . The poorer countries ? those with per capita GNPs of less than $200 , will be penalized the most . Hundreds of millions . of individuals within these countries , McNamara tells us , will for a whole decade " be able to detect , virtually no improvement whatever in their desperately low standards of living . " That is because their countries will not be able to reach anything like the 6 per cent annual growth in GNP which is needed before the condition of the poor can be appre- , ciably improved without assistance from outside . Projected to the end of the century  --  only a single generation away  --  the people of the developing countries will be enjoying per capita incomes , in 1972 dollars , of more than $8,000 a year ( not , overmuch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while the masses of the poor , who by that time will total some 2.25 billion , will be subsisting on less than $200 per capita , and 800 million of these will be existing on a semi Or actual starvation income of less than $100 . But this still understates the magnitude of the problem . The development that has occurred has not touched about 40 per cent of the people in " developing " countries . The situation is much like that of the United States in the early part of the Great Depression . President Hoover took steps to improve the lot of the great corporations , hoping that their regained prosperity would percolate down to the jobless . It did n't , and Roosevelt , Harry Hopkins and the other New Dealers provided direct help for those at the bottom of the economic pyramid . That worked , at least until Wdrld War II restored general prosperity . Even in the poorest developing countries , there are classes  --  the rich or well-off , and the poor . Bangladesh , to take an especially horrible example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but a substantial part of the relief supplies are appearing for sale in India . A senior Western diplomat in Dacca is quoted in The New York Times ( October 4 ) : " I say categorically that there are so many officials on the take . . . that I doubt that this government is going ' to last very long . " McNamara is trying to work out " income redistribution " in countries that borrow from the World Bank . He may be heading for a collision with the governments of some of the developing countries , and he acknowledges that each government must make its own decisions in respect to internal inequities . But the Bank has the money and the power to make decisions on where to lend , and on what conditions . Nothing is more important in the international arena than the outcome of McNamara 's efforts . And what Americans should be watching above all is hoW much ' support he gets from the next administration and its foreign policy makers . Standing Up to Meany Santa Fe George Meany may well be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months , ever since the Democratic National Convention , a collision had been ' approaching between the crusty president of the AFL-CIO and his state council in Colorado . In late September their difference of opinion reeled into court . Here is what has happened : Mr. Meany stomped home from the Democratic convention in Miami Beach , vowing he could n't support its ' Presidential nominee . Within a week he had called together the , national AFL-CIO Executive Council and rammed it , into a neutral corner in the coming campaign . It was the first time in the history of the AFL-CIO that it had abandoned a Democratic Presidential candidate. , The national and international affiliates of the AFLCIO were free to endorse whom they pleased . But not the state and local councils of , the parent , AFL-CIO . The edict went out : no endorsements and no working ' for a Presidential candidate . The Colorado Labor Council ( CLC ) flatly and flagrantly defied the Meany edict . Its political committee met on August 7 and voted 41 to 0 to endorse Senator McGovern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demanded that the CLC rescind the endorsement and fall back in line  --  or iface disciplinary action . The council 's executive board , unawed , met and reiterated the endorsement , 27 to 1 . Not only that , but it fired off a letter to Mr. Meany charging this his edict was " arbitrary , capricious , in excess of your authority and flagrantly offends the basic policies of the AFL-CIO . " Mr. Meany , now furious , dispatched a handpicked three-man " fact-finding " team to Denver . It met all day with the Colorado insurrectionists , in what Colorado labor officials said was no hearing but an inquisitiOn . The team returned to Washington and told Meany what he wanted to hear , that the CLC was guilty of violating AFL-CIO rules . Meany promptly dismissed the CLC 's officers and ordered the unit thrown into trusteeship . Before the trustee even arrived in Denver , CLC President Herrick Roth was headed for the court , saying , " We will resist any action to make us rescind our endorsement . And we will test it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " CLC attorney Philip Hornbein was even blunter : " We will not back down , retreat ? Ir knuckle under to Meany 's demands . " A federal district judge in Denver in early September ruled in favor of the council . He issued a preliminary injunction barring any Meany take-over . Mr. Roth and his board are still in control , still defiant , and for the moment fully legal . On October 6 , a special convention of the Colorado State Labor Council , whose delegates ' represented 51,000 of some 77,000 members , voted 228 to 10 to sustain every action council officials had taken . The next move is Meany 's , Whether he intended it this way or not , he has now gone too far to turn back . At stake is not only the future of the Colorado council but the entire relationship of Meany to his subordinate councils . An ultimate victory in the courts for the mutineering local could unhinge completely not only AFL-CIO control over its subordinate bodies but the very future of Meany himself . If he loses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eroded beyond repair . Mr. Meany sees Roth as a publicity seeking troublemaker " with a fixed determination to endorse McGovern regardless of whether that would violate the policy and rules of the AFL-CIO . " But it is Meany 's fixed determination not to endorse McGovern that has turned the Colorado council onto its daring , defiant course . How many other state councils secretly- feel the same way is hard to say . Mr. Roth insists that at least thirteen others have quietly assured him they support his defiance and that another thirty would be glad to see the Colorado council win the fight . If it does win , ' Meany will no longer be omnipotent , and omnipotence has been the essence of his long rule . JACK WAUGH The Public as Plaintiff The rebellion 's young are always being urged ta " work within the system , " and Ralph Nader has shown that ' it can be done effectively . Perhaps , however , it would be more accurate to say that it has been done effectively in the past . Under the Nixon Supreme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it may become a good ; deal more difficult in the future . It has just come to light that Burger did something strange , unprecedented , and perhaps ominous , last August . He sent his appointee , Rowland F. Kirks , director of the administrative office of the United States courts , to see Speaker of the . House Carl Albert on a matter that has been agitating the Chief . Justice for some time . He fears that a certain type of new law , against pollution , for example , will provoke litigation that may clog the already overburdened courts . He is particularly opposed to class actions by consumers , conservationists , et al . Some may feel that overloading the judicial system is not the only cause of the Chief Justice 's apprehensions : he may foresee that business will be unduly hampered . Accompanying Kirks on the ' Visit to Albert was the one-time famous New Deal lawyer , Thomas ( " Tommy the , Cork " ) Corcoran , who represents drug interests , among others . The purpose of the visit was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right to sue . Corcoran did the lobbying , Kirks merely sat by , assenting but , whether officially or not , representing the Chief Justice . The bill was modified on the House floor to permit personal injury suits involving products only if $10,000 in damages , or more , was alleged . The issue has ' larger ramifications than Burger 's intervention , although the impropriety of a Chief Justice lobbying for or against legislation is important in itself . In a sense , the last recourse of those who would fight for reform within the system is the class action , in which an individual or organization sues on behalf of all other parties similarly ' affected . Young lawyers , many of them recruited by Nader or moved by his example , have become quite , sophisticated in this area of litigation and are constantly developing the " class action " to cope with new situations and issues . As a current example , New York City has filed an action against the General Motors Corporation on its own behalf and that of all other cities , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charges that the company has what amounts to a practical monopoly , with GM manufacturing some 70 per cent of full-size busses and another company assembling the rest from GM parts . Such actions , it will be noted , are not of minor importance : in this case , if New York wins and treble damages are allowed , more than $100 million could be involved . At this time , when the class action is broadening in scope , it is not surprising that powerful interests have begun to zero in on Ralph Nader . Lately almost every issue of the Congressional Record carries one or more anti-Nader statements . The issue will also become of increasing importance because the Nixon Administration has succeeded in defeating legislative measures designed to ' create a strong consumer protection agency . Another important consideration is the outlook for a lopsided , pro-business attitude in the Supreme Court . An article by Louis M. Kohlmeier in the October 5th Wall Street Jyurnal discusses this trend at length . President Nixon 's four appointments have moved the Court rightward , and the end is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marshall and Brennan  --  are left of the once liberal majority of the Warren Court , and nowadays they are on the defensive . John A. Morsell , assistant executive director of the NAACP , is quoted as saying that " the Nixon thrust has sent us to our knees for the good health " of these three . If the president is re-elected , he will almost certainly be able to buttress the prevailing conservative " thrust " and it could persist for a generation . Even now , as the lobbying activities of the Chief Justice indicate , the outlook for new precedents which would strengthen the " class action " as an instrument of reform are not bright .
