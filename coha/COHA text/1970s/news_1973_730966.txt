txt John Korman , a salesman whose job requires extensive driving , swears he uses seat belts " 95% of the time . " One day last spring , however , he neglected them . " I do n't know why I did n't use them that day , " Mr. Korman says . " I was sitting on them . " That morning , Mr. Korman left his home in Pennsylvania bound for Frederick , Md. , on a routine business trip . But an hour from home a 15,000-pound school bus slammed into the side of his car , flinging Mr. Korman across the front seat and destroying his 1972 Mercury . By all rights , Mr. Korman should have been one of the nearly two million Americans who have died in accidents in the 75 years of the automobile . But today Mr. Korman is alive and well . What saved him was an air bag that inflated inside the front compartment of his car the instant it and the bus crashed . The bag popped out of the steering column and formed a large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the windshield or some sturdy portion of the car 's interior . " I blacked out , " Mr. Korman says . " When I came to , the air bag was all around me . " He survived because his employer , Allied Chemical Corp. , makes air bags , and the car he was driving was experimentally equipped with one . A GM Option Next Year Auto makers have been working intensively on the air bag in recent years because they are required by the federal government to develop a " passive restraint system " to protect passengers in car wrecks . " Passive " refers to a system that does n't require any effort by the passenger ? as opposed to buckling up seat belts . The air bag is the most advanced system that has much chance of being produced in the near future . General Motors plans to offer air bags as an option on up to 100,000 cars beginning early next year ; Chrysler has said it may offer air bags as an option on all its 1976 models . The device , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense . It is a large bag of specially coated material that . fits in the steering column or other parts of the car 's interior . It is backed up by a cylinder of highly compressed air , plus a sensor that releases the air  --  with explosive force  --  into the bag in case of an accident . The bag inflates to protect the rider ; usually , it is set to go off at about a 12-m.p.h. impact . Mr. Korman , the Allied Chemical salesman , was lucky to have an air bag in his car . Today there are less than 2,000 such cars . All are sponsored by either the auto manufacturers or air-bag makers and are placed in fleets of volunteering companies or government agencies ? such as Coca-Cola , Monsanto , Goodyear , Allstate Insurance and Washington 's park police . The drivers of the cars , for the most part , are volunteers . They do n't get into accidents on purpose , of course , but accidents do happen ? more than 300 of them so far involving their cars . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air bags . Answering Some Questions The point of these field tests is to settle some of the controversy that for years has kept air bags in the courts and laboratories and out of the cars . Do the bags deploy when necessary ? If they do , will they save lives ? Are they fouled by heat , cold , altitude or aging ? Are the bags themselves so powerful they cause injury ? And what is it like to be in an accident in a car with air bags ? The current experiments indicate , for one thing , that air bags can work well  --  although not without exception . In the accidents serious enough to explode the air bags , there was one fatality  --  a 7-week-old baby . An executive of a company that makes air bags walked away from a crash with an impact of 60 to 65 m.p.h . And in most cases , passengers were neither hurt nor frightened by the explosion of the air bag itself . Whatever their fears , they were allayed when the bags saved them .. But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be used in addition to the bags . Another is whether air bags will remain uninflated except in accidents . In Massachusetts , a woman passenger was injured when an air bag in the car in which she was riding went off , although there was n't an accident or abnormal movement .. Other Questions Unresolved Still other questions may be left unresolved by the current experiments . What happens to a pipe-smoking passenger when an air bag explodes in his face ? Are air bags effective in protecting little children ? What happens to the high-pressure cylinder when the car is junked ? is it dangerous lying around ? And is the added cost of the air bags worth the added protection to the customer ? GM has said it expects to start out charging around $200 for its air bags . The sponsors of the experimental fleets  --  the air-bag and auto makers  --  are reluctant ' to offer an assessment so far because there have been so few accidents . But the auto makers watch the cars like hawks . GM has teams of investigators on call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment they get word  --  via a hot line ? of a crash . Investigators try to get to the scene before the car is moved . One of the sponsors , Ford Motor Co. , remains particularly skeptical of air bags . Chairman Henry Ford U , who once described them as " a lot of baloney , " says , " We think if you do n't have safety belts the air bags are no good . " He says Ford believes the interlocking seat and shoulder belt systems , which are . required on all 1974 model cars and cost less than air bags " will save just as many lives as air bags . " Most of those who have been in the accidents offer resounding support for the air bags . The result was a collision with an impact of 60 to 65 m.p.h . Mr. Worsey says he remembers nothing about the accident  --  except that when he regained consciousness , some people were trying to get him out of the car . " Without air bags in that car , " Mr. Worsey believes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Charles DuBose , 25 , a grocery salesman from Hoover , Ala. , was driving an air-bag car because his employer had leased it as part of GM 's field test . GM had warned Mr. DuBose about the noise an air bag might make . But when Mr. DuBose 's car ran off the road at 25 m.p.h. and hit a tree , he says , he was n't even aware of the air bag until it was fully inflated . If it had n't been for the bag , he says , " I probably would have gone through the windshield . " Howard Shaper , an Atomic Energy Commission attorney , was on a skiing trip when his auto collided with an MG sports car . " I did n't have any sensation of the bag , " he says . He lost consciousness for 15 to 30 seconds and " when I regained consciousness , the bag was already deflating , " he says . Mr. Shaper believes that he , too , would have " gone through the windshield " without the air bags @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trip . In fact , despite all the warnings about the explosive nature of the air bag , few of the people interviewed had any recollection of the bag 's going off . But there were some accidents that raise questions about whether air bags alone offer enough protection . Mary Lou St. Aubin of Calumet City , Ill. , credits air bags with saving her life , according to her attorney . But Mrs. St. Aubin did break her left leg and a bone in her right foot in the accident , and it bad a tragic ending : Mrs. St. Aubin 's seven-week-old baby was killed . It is n't clear what happened to the baby between the time the brakes were slammed on and the time the collision occurred . The baby was lying unrestrained on the seat beside Mrs. St. Aubin . Mrs. St. Aubin and her husband wo n't talk about the accident . But their attorney feels that litigation is possible . " We have n't dismissed the possibility that General Motors might have been responsible because seat belts were n't supplied , " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 53 , a casualty-insurance adjuster , collided with a garbage truck . He says the side of his face hit the rearview mirror and was lacerated . But he credits his seat belt , not the air bag , with making the accident less serious . " I think if the air bag did have any effect , it was minimal , " Mr. Wagoner says . ( On the other hand , Mr. Korman , whose car was hit by the school bus , feels that he would have been more seriously injured if he had been wearing a seat belt ; he thinks it would have trapped him on the impact side of the car . ) Finally , there is the case of the mysterious explosion . GM says the woman , from Lowell , Mass. , was sitting in the right front seat of a car that was moving slowly and normally . Suddenly , the air bag deployed , bursting into the car 's passenger compartment and injuring the woman 's thumb . GM is still trying to determine whether the accidental deployment was a freak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system .
