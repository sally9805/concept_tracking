THE " POETRY " ANTHOLOGY : 1912-1977 <P> Edited by Daryl Hine and Joseph Parisi <P> Houghton Mifflin ; 555 pages ; $20 hardcover , $10.95 paperback <P> In 1912 a middle-aged woman named Harriet Monroe persuaded 100 fellow Chicagoans to contribute $50 apiece for five years running . Why ? To underwrite a monthly magazine that would publish the best new poetry . As an investment , the project had its drawbacks . First , no one had ever gone broke underestimating America 's hunger for good verse . Second , even if acceptable , bill-paying poetry was available , Harriet Monroe seemed singularly ill-equipped to find it . Her own best efforts in the field amounted to little but boosterism : " Hail to thee , fair Chicago ! On thy brow/ America , thy mother , lays a crown ... " <P> Nevertheless , this Windy City bard founded Poetry : A Magazine of Verse . Within three years she printed an odd-looking work that opened with six lines of Italian and then proceeded : " Let us go then , you and I/ When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patient etherized upon a table ... " Nothing quite like T.S . Eliot 's " The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock " had ever appeared before . The expatriate gentleman from St. Louis and the lady from Chicago put each other on the map . <P> Stranger things than Poetry have happened in publishing , but not many . The magazine never thrived , but it survived , outlasting decades of precarious financing , attempted coups by competing schools of poets and unvarying public in difference . Its monthly circulation rarely topped 9,000 copies , but the journal 's reach vastly exceeded its grasp . Whether or not they always read Poetry , nearly every American poet who mattered in this century submitted manuscripts to it . <P> Pressing 65 years ' worth of such contributions between the covers of a single anthology ought to produce something like essence of attar . It does not , as former Poetry Editor Daryl Hine admits in his introduction : " Much of what has appeared in Poetry , early and late , is mediocre , and seems more so today . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one other great poem : Wallace Stevens ' " Sunday Morning , " which survived even Harriet Monroe 's rather highhanded editing and rearranging of its stanzas . But the value of The " Poetry " Anthology does not rest on its Parnassian heights . Flipping through its pages is like watching time-lapse photography of American literary taste . <P> Ezra Pound was one of the magazine 's first contributors . Within a few years ( and a few pages ) a lot of poets are sounding like Pound . The muse seems hardly to notice World War I ; the next conflagration receives extended attention from writers as diverse as Randall Jarrell , Karl Shapiro and Robinson Jeffers . Teacher-poets appear in the ' 30s and ' 40s : R.P. Blackmur , William Empson , Allen Tate . A generation later is heard the dry academic rustle of those they taught .
