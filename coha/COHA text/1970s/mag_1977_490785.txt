THE TALK OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment 64-1976 , the telephone number of the New York office of the American Revolution Bicentennial Administration , is no longer in service . It is now no longer the Bicentennial Year . In case you missed it , it went something like this : It started and the campaigning for the primaries started and there were the Winter Olympics and Dorothy Hamill did pretty well , and it was really hot in New York in April , and then Carter started doing better than Scoop Jackson and then Tiger pitcher Mark Fidrych became famous after mowing down the Yankees on " Monday Night Baseball , " and then there was the raid on Entebbe and the Israelis really pulled it off and Idi Amin accused the Israelis of using atomic hand grenades to put the guards to sleep , then the Fourth of July Bicentennial business started up with the Tall Ships and the Greeley , Colorado , rodeo on TV , and Queen Elizabeth came and there was a party for her at the White House where Bob Hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ version of " Thanks for the Memory " containing the lines " Thank you , Great Britain/ For the greatest literature ever written " and then the next night the Queen gave a party where Elizabeth Taylor and her soon to be sixth husband John Varner , then head of the Bicentennial Administration , appeared together for the first time , and then there was the Democratic Convention in New York and Carter looked great and paraphrased Bob Dylan in his acceptance speech , and then there were the Summer Olympics and Nadia Comaneci did really well and Olga Korbut was really depressed and then Johnny Carson did a bit on the " Tonight Show " where he told a joke and Doc Severinsen and Ed McMahon and the producer held up cards with " 10 " written on them , indicating that Johnny had told a perfect joke for the first time in the history of comedy , and then there was the Republican Convention and Ford won and then they took a break and then they started campaigning really hard , then Mao died , then there were the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes of silence in the first one and during the down time a television correspondent , filling space , said to Carter 's press secretary , Jody Powell , " What about these rumors that there may have been some kind of sabotage ? Do you think there 's any truth to them ? " and Powell said " I have n't heard any rumors like that , have you ? " and the correspondent said " Uh , no , " then Earl Butz got into trouble , and then Carter won in November and Ford lost his voice , but his wife talked for him , then there was the transitionof-power business and the Gary Gilmore business and that was about it . Also , Wayne Hays got into trouble and the Yankees got creamed in the Series and Viking landed on Mars . The Bicentennial started out interesting , became tedious , became really tedious , and then continued past any considerations of whether it was interesting or not . It was made fun of , overdone , taken with every possible degree of seriousness , but almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is hard to think of a single avenue of commercial exploitation which was left unexplored . But the Bicentennial happened , and , as it did , it paid varying amounts of attention to the things that were done for it and about it , and it was a big success . Many people looked forward to the year with dread : balconies and Jersey cliffs were supposed to collapse and people were supposed to drown during the Tall Ships display ; Democrats were supposed to get mugged during the Convention ; voters were supposed to not show up on Election Day . None of those things happened . It is as if people , after too many novelty posters of Nixon and Agnew waving gaily in prison stripes , could n't believe that America might he involved in something basically good , just as it was hard for them to believe the opposite of their country during the early days of the Vietnam War . For our part , we liked the Bicentennial ; it left us with a tremendous clean-windshield feeling . ? ? Dutch THE New-York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its well-stocked storerooms and archives , but its most recent temporary installation , " The Dutch Republic in the Days of John Adams " ( which got here just under the wire and will continue until January 9th ) , was put together in Holland by the Netherlands Bicentennial Committee and has come to Central Park West through the Smithsonian Institution Travelling Exhibition Service . The opening-night guests , invited by the society and the Netherlands Consulate General , included Paul O'Dwyer , the President of the City Council ; John Zuccotti , the First Deputy Mayor ; Benjamin Sonnenberg , the squire of Gramercy Park ; and Professor J. H. Plumb , the historian , of Christ 's College , Cambridge , and of the Hotel Carlyle . Champagne and strolling minstrels accompanied a display , culled from more than sixty Dutch museums and private collections , of portraits , landscapes , political cartoons , architectural prints and drawings , porcelains , scientific apparatus , and reconstructed rooms . A splendidly indexed and illustrated catalogue opens with an essay , " John Adams and the Dutch Republic " ( Adams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is remarkable for its objectivity . It starts out : When on April 19 , 1775 , the shot heard round the world is fired , its echo is scarcely audible in the Netherlands . Holland , or rather the Republic of the Seven United Provinces , is no longer a power of international significance as it was in the seventeenth century ; it has been far surpassed by Britain and France . It is still a nation with an impressive trade , and a center of finance , but it has its Golden Age behind it . True , general decline has not set in , but the germs of decay are there . The Dutch live on their old glory , timorously and distrustfully .... The constitution of the Dutch Republic was highly complex , so that it took even so astute and trained an observer as John Adams a long time to comprehend the reality hidden behind all that semblance of representation and to see where the true power lay .... The stadholder i.e. , chief magistrate , William V Prince of Orange , was , unfortunately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even his own wife despaired . Moreover , he was so devoted to the British Court ... that he could and would not see the Americans as anything but evil-minded rebels . The state portrait of William in the show seems to bear out this description . ( The subject 's wife is not included . ) The evil-minded rebels pop up in picture after picture . Since the Dutch , by and large , were anti-British , the Americans are favorably portrayed ; that is , they are made to look like Indians . " An Indian , his head adorned with feathers , sometimes with brown corn- ? ? plexion , was the most common allegory for the United States , " the catalogue says . " No doubt , it reflected the veneration of the noble savage , so popular in the eighteenth century . " A lively example of this reflected veneration occurs in a print that depicts an English peace delegation appearing before the Continental Congress . The four Englishmen look decidedly obsequious ; the Americans , standing under a canopy of straw , consist of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Prudence . We turned from this invigorating scene to milder scenes of the Latin School in Amsterdam , attended by John Adams ' two young sons , and of Amsterdam 's Dam Square , with a 1795 " tree of liberty " under which the American flag was flown side by side with the flags of the French and the Dutch ; and a Communion set of goblets , decanters , and dishes of silver gilt and pure gold ; and sugar boxes , tobacco jars , mother-of-pearl-lidded boxes , and so on . All dated from the time when Adams was negotiating loans from the Dutch . During the evening , the Consul-General of the Netherlands , Mr. W. S. J. Campagne , presented Dr. James J. Heslin , the director of the society , with a bronze medal bearing the likeness of John Adams . Two hundred such medals are available in the NethJANUARY 3 , 19 7 7 erlands for fifty dollars apiece , plus postage . They may be ordered from Ms. Louise Met ; Bovenstraat 149 , Rotterdam . Dr. Heslin has turned his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last of eight Bicentennial shows we 've put on , " he said to us as we left " It 's been a great year . Attendance has gone up . Did you see the cases displaying Adams letters from our own collection ? We thought they would beef things up a little . " The Way to Go WHAT could he happening at the Tavern-on-the-Green at ten o'clock in the morning , we wanted to know when our friend the old curmudgeon commanded us to appear there at that unlikely hour one day last week . " There will he Irish coffee at the end of what 's happening " was all he would say . That was enough to start us off . But we were hardly prepared for what we saw when we arrived , belatedly , at half past ten . The Tavern 's empty parking lot had been unchained , and in it the old curmudgeon , in unaccustomed garb ( no hat , a Harris-tweed jacket , and an alpaca-wool muffler floating behind him ) , was describing figure eights on the macadam astride a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's hike , bright-orange , and sounded no more obstreperous than a Singer sewing machine . The o.c. aimed his vehicle directly at us , then jammed the brakes on hard and stopped only two feet away . " Good morning , " he said . " I 'm offidaily test-driving the Solex 4600 , the first motorized bicycle to appear on the streets of New York . And I 'm testing it on behalf of all us millions of hitherto second-class citizens . At last , by decree of the Sovereign State of New York , we are free to make much better use of the highways for which we have for so long been taxed almost utterly without representation . Automobiles that can travel at a hundred miles an hour and thirty-five-ton trucks that roll at seventy have had this freedom for ever so long . And now the authorities have  --  I assume reluctantly  --  authorized non-motorists like me , who have never in their lives owned a driver 's license , to become traffic menaces with this machine , rated at eight-tenths of one horsepower and capable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The authorities have gone as far as to designate this vehicle a bicycle , which requires no driver 's license , helmet , registration , or insurance . And we can park on the sidewalk . Democracy works ! " The curmudgeon dismounted and handed us his motorized bicycle . " This is , of course , what the English call a moped , because it can be propelled either by motor or by pedal , " he said . " And it 's so blooming simple in concept that I can not guess why Henry Ford did n't invent it as soon as he had finished inventing the Model T. The little one-cylinder , two-stroke motor is practically built into the steering column . Push this small lever here and a roller within the motor comes to rest on top of the front tire  --  a simple friction operation . No gears . These two small levers on the handlebars control the brakes , and turning the little vulcanized-rubber grip on the right handlebar accelerates or decelerates the motor . Complete Henry Ford simplicity ! Now get on it and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We pedalled and motored about for a while , quickly mastering the beast . We described some figure eights ourself and a four-leaf clover or two , and by the time we glided to a halt beside the old curmudgeon he had been joined by Serge Seguin , vice-president of Motobecane America , Ltd. , which imports the Solex 4600 from France . " You probably noticed the Solex is a bit heavier than an ordinary bicycle , because of the motor , " Seguin said to us . " But , even so , it weighs only sixty-eight pounds . Motobecane has been making motorized bicycles in France for thirty years , and one Frenchman out of every nine owns the machine . It was n't legal anywhere in the United States as recently as October of 1974 , and then the federal government devised standards , and four states followed through almost simultaneously with specific operating conditions . New York State came around only a few weeks ago on the first of Decem-ber  --  and already we 've set up five agencies in this city , each with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so that he can take care of repair work . On a level road in the country , the machine will run up to two hundred and eighteen miles on a gallon of gasoline . The lubrication is very simple . You simply add an ounce of oil to each tank of gas . The tank holds a third of a gallon , but you can get more than fifty miles in the city on that . " " Yes , " said the old curmudgeon . " I wheeled into a service station yesterday morning and said , Tfll ' er up ! ' The dealer looked at the tank , then looked at me , then looked at the tank again . But he filled ' er up . I handed him fifty cents , and , by God , he handed me change hack . " A man stopped his car beside us in the parking lot , got out , and said , " What 's going on here ? " " This is a French motorized bicycle , " Seguin said , " and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've come over from France to introduce it . " " From France ! " said the man , and the conversation instantly switched into French . The gist of it was that the interlocutor was a French commercial photographer operating in this city , and he had ordered two Solexes , one for himself and one for his messenger , who would use it to carry proofs about town to advertising agencies . Seguin and the photographer shook hands , and the photographer departed . " The Solex comes in three colors , " Seguin said to us . " Orange , blue , or yellow . It has a headlight , a taillight , a stoplight , reflectors , a horn , and fenders , and it retails for about three hundred and twenty dollars . We also offer as extras a rearview mirror , a single basket or double baskets mounted over the rear wheel , nylon saddlebags , a high-security lock , and a carrier that will attach the Solex to the rear bumper of most automobiles . " " Ah , yes , " said the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For all practical purposes , you ca n't ride this bike across bridges or through tunnels . To get the bike out of the city , you 've got to walk it across a bridge , or you 've got to sling it on the back of a car , antlers and all , so you look like a poacher with a deer you 've shot in the Poconos . Or else you can get it out of town the way most cyclists get their hikes out  --  Lake it down to Penn Station and have it loaded into the baggage car of an Amtrak express train . Most state governments still believe that all their citizens should travel by machinery whose consumption of gasoline is maniacal . In general , state governments want to see only big vehicles on their freeways ; never mind the cyclists and the people who will buy Solexes . And they 've never even heard of railroads  --  or anything about the Goodyear-tire people 's recent prediction that by the mid-nineteen-eighties there will he more two-wheel vehicles in the United States than four-wheel vehicles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and energy consumption , the ostriches in the state capitols are keeping their heads in the sand . What used to be called state departments of highways are now calling themselves state departments of transportation , but you go into their head offices , as I went into one of them a while back to see a friend of mine , and you will discover nothing but the same old highway engineers planning for every contingency but mass transportation . I have spoken . " " Time for Irish coffee , " said Seguin , leading us inside the Tavern , though it was not yet open for lunch . We sat down , now sheltered from the rather frosty morning breeze , in the handsome **26;5344;TOOLONG bar , and M. Seguin rusded up the local publican . After we had given our orders , the old curmudgeon asked Seguin what his native dOartement is . " I was horn in Normandy , " Seguin said . " And where is the Solex built ? " the curmudgeon asked . " In SaOne-et-Loire  --  in Macon , " said Seguin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town that is visited by every wine-and-food society worthy of the name , but for a rather different reason . " The Irish coffee arrived . " Toast ! " said the old curmudgeon . " In consideration of the happiness the Solex has brought me , I name you , M. Seguin , my favorite wheeler-dealer . " Results TWICE each year , on a random date in June and again in December , the State Board of Law Examiners releases a list of the names of the newly minted lawyers who have passed New York 's rigorous ( and , we are told , highly undiverting ) bar examination . The publication of the results , which takes place several months after the exam is administered , approaches mysteriously . As a result of some telephoning around , word goes out that " the news " is imminent , and suddenly symptoms of dread and anxiety proliferate in law offices around town . Young law associates begin to chew erasers , spill coffee on their research materials , absentmindedly spindle their roast-beef sandwiches . Among the daily newspapers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bar-exam results , If a Thursday release date has been ordained  --  as was the case recently  --  several hundred young attorneys rush to Times Square Wednesday night to buy the earliest edition of the next day 's Times . Those concerned refer to this edition as the " Bluebird of Happiness " or " Condor of Discontent " issue , depending upon their personal circumstances . Hitting the streets early to buy a copy is considered by many neophyte barristers a rite of passage ( or , in some instances , a rite of non-passage ) as indispensable as dramatically raising one 's voice during a mock-trial cross-examination , buying a Crouch &; Fitzgerald briefcase , or slapping one 's first tort-feasnr with a sheaf of threatening documents . The two busiest newsstands in Times Square at Forty-second Street and Seventh Avenue , opposite Nedicks , and at Forty-third and Broadway , next to the entrance to Nathan 's  --  normally receive a large order of newspapers by tnick shortly after ten o'clock . About twenty minutes before the trucks arrive , these newsstands receive hand deliveries of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " As a rule , the Bluebird/Condor flashes are consumed with a celerity that would dazzle newsprint-eating locusts . Anyone passing through Times Square on the third Wednesday of December , 1976 , a half hour before the flashes were due would have been able to witness a rare and touching sight : for that one evening , the boldest habitues of that part of town  --  the women who wear high-heeled boots and pink nylon wigs , and the skilled operators of chuck-a-luck shell games  --  had graciously yielded a piece of their turf to dozens of eager young Wall Streeters wearing trench-coats and carrying squash racquets . This juxtaposition , this ephemeral pas de deux , made a heart-warming tableau . In front of Nathan 's , we spoke to a member of the trenchcoat crowd whose name turned out to he Marc . " What am I doing here ? Oh , let 's just say that I want to see some people , " he said . " I would n't mind rounding up a few plaintiffs for a class-action suit against the Board of Law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I figure if I stick around long enough a few co-plaintiffs will wander by . " A friend of Marc 's , a former law-school classmate who goes by the nickname Wags , came up and spoke to hiin . " What are you doing ? " Wags asked . " You just feel like hanging out in Times Square for the evening ? " " Actually , that 's exactly right , " said Marc . " I was tipped off two days ago that I passed the bar . Tonight , I just happened to be in the neighborhood . I think I 'll stick around and soak it all in . There are very few things that can compensate for the agony of taking the bar exam . " At a quarter to ten , as the crowd began to grow , we walked across to the Times Building . Several cars pulled up , and the occupants leaned out to ask Times deliverymen or security guards what time the papers would be coming out . When we walked into the building lobby , a forerunner of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or fifty people had grabbed copies , turned to page 58 , and begun to scan an alphabetical list of two thousand nine hundred and forty-six names . Most of the people who take the bar exam  --  about four-fifths  --  pass on their first try . We heard shouts of " Ahh ! " " What 's the percentage ? " ... " Hold on a second  --  how do you spell your name ? " ... " I see it , there 's my name ! " " Hey , Bernie passed ! " ... " Where 's Otis ? Otis is n't in here , I ca n't believe it ! " We spoke with Saul jakubowitz and his friend /Weir Freund , from Brooklyn . They had just found their names on the list and were feeling cheerful . " How many newspapers did I buy ? Five copies . Why five ? Let 's just say that I was confident that I was going to pass , " said Saul . " I actually found out by calling the Appellate Division yesterday , " said - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not really knowing . What are we doing here ? Oh , we were just driving around  --  thought we 'd drop by . " A tall man , rumpled-looking , smiling , and appearing more than a tittle drunk , walked up and put his arms around Meir and Saul . " Did you make it ? I need to know . Did you make it ? " the man asked . " Yeah , we made it , " said Meir . High Energy OUR eleven-year-old friend Daniel Middleton came into town the other day to see Aerosmith and Rick Derringer in concert at Madison Square Garden . Daniel arrived wearing a small blue backpack that bore a sticker advertising Kiss , another rock-and-roll group . " I like Kiss , " Daniel told us . " They 're just disgusting . " " Disgusting " as Daniel uses it is a compliment . Daniel does not come THE NEW YORKER from a rock-and-roll family . As Daniel says , if his family were to like a rock-and-roll group it would have to he called the Register of Historic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Dutchess County . Daniel used to like Good Music , but a year or so ago he went through a Change . " Circus Magazine is the magazine that introduced me to all this , " Daniel told us . " Circus Magazine can tell you everything about Aerosmith and Kiss . Aerosmith conies from Boston . Steven Tyler , A erosmith 's lead singer , is the one who looks like Mick Jagger , except more disgusting . Joe Perry is pretty disgusting , too . " Daniel told us that he was not as enthusiastic about Circus Magazine as he had been at the beginning . " I have down-rated Circus , " he said . " But I still like it better than Creetn . Creern just does n't write about the group . There is just not enough information about the group . They did a big cover story on Kiss , but it was n't very complete . I 've just started to read Hit Parader . I like Hit Parader , because it gives you all the lyrics to all the songs . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Do n't he shocked if at the end they sing a song called ' Big Ten Inch Record , ' " Daniel said . " Also , I think that they wear really tight pants . It 's just disgusting . " At Madison Square Garden , we met a friend of ours a very contemporary young woman , who works for a record company . " What is your profession , anyway ? " Daniel asked the young woman . " First you work all day long and then you go to hear concerts every night , " the young woman said . " What label do you work for ? " Daniel asked . " Epic , " said the young woman . " That 's Ted Nugent 's label , " Daniel said . " Yes ! " said the young woman , vividly . " I like his first album , " said Daniel . " He had thirteen albums on other labels before we broke that one , " the young woman said proudly . " It must be fun to go to concerts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maybe , " said the young woman . " But hard on the ears , " Daniel said . " A lot of those guys might go deaf . " " The ears are nothing compared to the other senses that are assaulted . I got bruises at the Ted Nugent concert , " said the young woman . " He 's so high-energy , of course , " Daniel said . " They all have a lot of energy . I 've read interviews with Joe Perry , and he says that the only way to get through these concerts is to produce peak audiences through high energy instead of the music . " " Oh ! Oh ! " said the young woman , slightly shocked . Later , we listened to Rick Derringer from backstage . Aerosmith began to make preparations for its appearance . Steven Tyler , the lead singer of Aerosmith , walked by in a leopard-skin outfit . When Rick Derringer came offstage , the young woman from Epic Records took Daniel over to talk with him . We stood next to a very young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've been thinking more and more about rock and roll when it comes to women , and it 's really bad , " she said . Daniel returned from talking with Rick Derringer . " He 's a very nice person , " Daniel said . A stagehand walked by carrying a guim r . " That 's Joe Perry 's Les Paul , " Daniel said . Another stagehand walked by , carrying another guitar . " I hope I did n't get that mixed up , " Daniel said . We talked with Ron Alexenburg , of Epic Records , who goes to a lot of concerts himself , and Ron Alexenburg asked Daniel how old he was . " I 'm eleven , " said Daniel . " My oldest daughter is seven , " said Ron Alexenhurg . " I took her to a rock-and-roll concert . Minnie Riperton . She was going to present Minnie Riperton with a bouquet of roses , and she went to give them to her and the crowd charged . " " I do n't like the crowds , " Daniel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and roll , though , " Ron Alexenburg said . " She likes Boston , which is a very hot group . "
