Confusion and fear spew from a damaged reactor in Pennsylvania <P> In the dead of night , the hulks of four 372-ft. cooling towers and two high domed nuclear reactor container buildings were scarcely discernible above the gentle waters of the Susquehanna River , eleven miles southeast of Harrisburg , Pa . Inside the brightly lit control room of Metropolitan Edison 's Unit 2 , technicians on the lobster shift one night last week faced a tranquil , even boring watch . Suddenly , at 4 a.m. , alarm lights blinked red on their instrument panels . A siren whooped a warning . In the understated jargon of the nuclear power industry , an " event " had occurred . In plain English , it was the beginning of the worst accident in the history of U.S. nuclear power production , and of a long , often confused nightmare that threw the future of the nuclear industry into question . <P> There was no panic at the plant , situated on a stretch of muddy soil called Three Mile Island in an otherwise scenic bend in the river @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sirens before . They went about their task of meeting what looked at first like just another " transient , " a minor glitch somewhere in the complex system like so many they had dealt with in the past . Unit 2 's huge turbine , which generates 880 megawatts of electricity , had " tripped , " shut down automatically , as it should when the steam that turns it has somehow been cut off . The technicians assumed that the cause would be easy to find and correct . <P> They could hardly have been more wrong . For the next several days , radioactive steam and gas seeped sporadically into the atmosphere from the plant . Pennsylvania Governor Richard Thornburgh advised the evacuation of all pregnant women and preschool children living within five miles of Three Mile Island , and thousands of people fled the area . As tension mounted , engineers struggled to cool the reactor 's core . There was a genuine danger of a " meltdown , " in which the core could drop into the water coolant at the bottom of its chamber , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concrete walls of the containment building ; or the molten core could burn through the even thicker concrete base and deep into the earth . In either case , lethally radioactive gases would be released , causing a nuclear catastrophe . <P> At week 's end officials insisted that while the danger of a meltdown had not vanished , it was receding . Nevertheless , suspense as to the eventual outcome buttressed the claims of nuclear power 's foes that all the wondrous fail-safe gadgets of modern technology had turned out to be just as fallible as the men who had designed and built them . Declared Nuclear Power Critic Ralph Nader : " This is the beginning of the end of nuclear power in this country . "
