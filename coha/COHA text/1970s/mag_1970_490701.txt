THE TALK OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment OUR Subscription Department has sent us a Xerox copy of a letter from a former subscriber , noting with a rubber stamp at the top , " All Subscription matters in this letter have been attended to . " It is the non-Subscription matters we have been unable to get out of our mind . " In an attempt to live more sanely with our environment , " writes this left-handed organic gardener , " we are attempting to eliminate as much as possible any materials coming into our home which can not he used to enrich the land by composting . Since the pages of your magazine are not useful as a mulch , we will not purchase it and will urge others not to do so . We have heard of a paper-products company that is now producing materials suitable for composting , and we zouldhopc you would look into the possibility of doing business with a company like this . " Initially , we were piqued h ) the idea that this magazine , printed on 8iiG @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coated stock , can not enrich the land , but after thinking about it we do not agree that , properly treated , it could not be useful as a mulch . A mulch , after all , is simply a kind of quilt to protect wintering plants against the harshness of their environment . We believe we could furnish as much warmth as the next mulch . However , we admit we are not very suitable for composting . Although we have not yet looked into the possibility of doing bus'ness with a company that produces compostable stock , we understand our reader 's concern . Composting is an exciting way of changing otherwise worthless leaves , grass cuttings , coffee grounds , and other organic stuff I but nothing mailable second-class ) into a heady chocolate-colored mold that drives whatever it touches into a frenzy of growth . As a matter of fact , we know a gardener in Larchmont who is so enthusiastic about his compost heap that he will take guests out to it in the middle of winter and invite them to feel the heat of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the elbow  --  a reportedly ineffable sensation . It is not hard , therefore , to imagine what a really great service it would be to our environment , both physical and spiritual , if most of what is written were printed on materials suitable for reduction to humus . The contents of an urban mailbox : grocery flyers , contest offers , department-store catalogues , letters from congressmen , unsolicited credit cards  --  compost ! Materials coming into the office : newsletters , publicity releases , vanity publications , review copies , Xerox copies , topics of copies , interoffice memos mulch ! The printed records of controversy  --  literary , philosophical , scientific , and religious  --  for a start , and then most newspapers , most magazines , perhaps most books , nearly all second-and third-class mail , and probably most first-class not only might he suitable for composting but might selfdestruct after a given time , disintegrating into a clean organic powder to enrich the roots of zinnias or cabbages , or to he recycled by nourishing the seedlings of trees from which paper is made . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for ecologyminded literati . True , this fantasy is not likely to he realized soon . We know a lot of writers who would not comfortably consign their words to any materials with a Half-life of less than five hundred years . But we promise that from now on we will attempt to live  --  more sanely  --  with this question about anything we read : Ought this to enrich the land by composting , or is it something we want to keep around " Friday Foster " THE new comic strip " Friday Foster , " which has been appearing locally in the News since January 1 bth , is about a pretty black girl making her way in the white world . In the first story , which will run for sixteen weeks , she starts out as a photographer in a Harlem night club , but she does n't stay there long . In a few weeks , the chance to become an assistant to a high-fashion photographer comes her way , and this involves her in a good deal of intrigue in the magazine-publishing world . Subsequent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apiece  --  the standard length these days for any episode in a comic strip with a story line  --  will deal with this theme and introduce her to several new ones . We found all this our when we had a talk with Jim Lawrence , the man responsible for " Friday Foster , " at his home , near Summit , New Jersey . Mr. Lawrence told us that the idea for a strip with a black heroine had come to him one day two years ago when he picked up a copy of the Newark Evening Nrw.r and turned to the funnies page . " I was running my eye down the page , " he said , " and I suddenly said to myself , ' God , here 's a page full of nothing but white faces ! And Newark 's a town that 's well over half black ! ' It struck me as very wrong . " Lawrence decided to do something about it A few days later , he saw the model Donyale Luna on a TV show and was impressed by what she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Detroit , and I am , too , " he told us , in partial explanation . That gave him the idea of doing a strip about a gorgeous , hip black chick , and eventually it produced " Friday Foster . " Lawrence worked on the idea in his spare time , because he was then  --  and still is  --  the writer of another strip ? " James Bond , " which appears in the London Daily E.vtre. , ss  --  and of children 's hooks ; his latest , " Binky Brothers and the Fearless Four , " will be out this spring . He now also writes " Captain Easy , " which appears in the New York Column . Lawrence got a Spaniard named Jorge LongarOn , who lives in Barcelona , to draw " Friday Foster . " " There 's quite a comic-book operation on the Continent that we never see over here , " Lawrence said . " Many of the artists are Italian or Spanish . Longardn 's one of the best . He has a very distinctive style . Most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hooks , assisting other artists . It tends to make their work bland and blended . " When Lawrence had " Friday Foster " worked out to his own and Longanin 's satisfaction , he took it to the Chicago Tribune-New York News Syndicate . This was a year ago . It turned out that the Syndicate had been looking for an integrated strip for some time . It had just started running a gag strip ( the comic-strip equivalent of a one-liner : no story , and a different joke every day ) based on " Laugh-In " and using black characters , and now it was in the market for a continuity strip ( the kind of comic strip that does tell a story ) featuring blacks . The Syndicate people liked " Friday Foster , " and they worked on it for a while . Ye talked with a man at the Syndicate the other day , who told us , " We showed it to a cross-section of black people , and most of them liked it . We found out some interesting things , too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as ' gals . ' They call them ' girls . ' " Eventually , the Syndicate lined lip some twenty-five papers that wanted to run " Friday Foster , " including three papers in the South : the Nashville Banner ; the Charlotte , North Carolina , News ; and the Shreveport , Louisiana , Journal . Lawrence and Lungar6n keep about twenty weeks ahead of the publication schedule . This is necessary because Longar ( wi works through an agent in London , so each episode has to go from Summit to London to Barcelona and hack to London and across the ocean again . The second story will begin in the papers on Sunday , May lOth . Lawrence says he does n't want to give away the plot . Milking a Cow at the Flower Show WE spent a joyful hour at the Inv V ternational Flower Show last week in the company of a friend of ours , a girl named Monique , who loves flowers and knows all about them . Monique 's husband , whose name is Sam , was also along , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everybody to look for the herb lady , " Monique said when we got inside . " She 's very important . If any-one gets lost , we 'll meet at the herb lady 's . " Sam noticed a sign that advertised the Garden View Restaurant and Cocktail Lounge , and said that if he got lost he 'd meet everybody there . " He wants to get lost , of course , poor boy , " Monique said to us . " He always does . Come on . " We came on , abandoning Sam , and Monique explained that the Coliseum was a very logical building , so if we wanted to see the show efficiently , we would have to proceed in a logical fashion . She suggested that we circle the periphery and then tackle the center . The periphery took us past the booth of the American Rhododendron Society , and Monique waved at the man on duty . The man smiled a little but did not wave hack . " He did n't wave hack last year , either , " said Monique @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Nearby was a liliesof-the-valley exhibit , where we stopped . A sign said that the lilies of the valley on display had beets " grown by amateurs , " and Monique was delighted . " All they really like to do in life , is grow , " she said . " Lilies of the valley , that is -- nut amateurs . " Monique passed up the stand of the African Violet Society of Greater New York , which had drawn a crowd . " Such an unrewarding plant , " she said . " Just the opposite of Hies of the valley . African violets have never really learned to enjoy growing . You will note that all those women have worried looks , " We looked , and she was right . She hurried on , and came to a stop before an exhibit prepared by the New York City Housing Authority . The Authority , we learned , will give any group of from three to ten of its tenants twenty-five dollars for flower seeds and up to three hundred square feet of earth in which to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Monique quickly struck up an acquaintance , and he told her that every year , in August , there is a competition to see who has grown the best garden . Last year , he said , three hundred and twenty-five gardens were grown , in a hundred and five projects , by more than four thousand people , who ranged in age from three to ninety-seven , He also said that a lot of people had hoarded seeds from last year to get a jump on this year 's competition . No one seemed to know where the herb lady was , but finally a motherly woman who represented the American Begonia Society pointed us in the right direction . Sam was not at the herb lady 's . Instead , he was in the middle of the floor looking at an exhibit that consisted of a cow , a calf , two sheep , and three lambs , all of them surrounded by a floral border . The cow 's name was Milky , and when Monique saw Milky she said , " That cow needs milking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We climbed through the floral border and over a small fence . We found a blue pail in a little shed and squatted down beside Milky and went to work . We were a little rusty , because we had n't milked a cow for a number of years , but old skills come hack quickly when they are needed , and in a couple of minutes we had the rhythm . Milky was obviously delighted . We dipped our finger in the bucket for a taste . There is no taste in the world like warm new milk . Draft Repeal THIS week is Anti-Draft Week , and last week we had a chance to sit down and talk with Mr. James Bristol , the organizer of the National Council to Repeal the Draft , who was in town for the day From Washington , where the Council has its headquarters . Mr. Bristol is a cheerful , quiet , and forceful man in his fifties , and we asked him to tell us something about his work end about himself . " The Council is just over a year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ draft by the end of June , 1971 , " he said . " We use the word ' repeal , ' rather than ' end , ' because we want not only to stop the drafting of young men but to dismantle the machinery that makes it possible to draft young men . In 1947 , the Selective Service Act was allowed to expire but the machinery " How about our delivering a Stoic of the Solar System Message before . Nixon gets to thinking he 's everybody ? " remained intact . That meant that as soon as a new Selective Service Act was passed , as it was the following year , the induction system was reactivated very easily . June , ' 71 , is our deadline , because that 's when the current act will expire . I think there were two considerations that impelled a group of some thirty of us , from various peace , religious , and student organizations , to hand together and set up the National Council , in January , 1969 . The first consideration was our feeling that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done whenever Selective Service came up for extension was lobby for retention of the right to conscientious objection . We would always preface our testimony with the statement that we were opposed to all military conscription , but we would always go on to say , But as long as it exists , we support alternativ ? service for C.O.s . ' In using that word ' hut , ' we finally realized , we were really just supporting conscription . The second strand in our thinking was a realization that if the draft no longer existed , we would no longer have to devote all our energies to draft counselling and draft resistance . When a resister refuses to cooperate with the draft , he is , in effect , repealing the draft for himself . But it still exists for r.very one else . " After a short pause , Mr. Bristol went on , " We decided to take no stand on what , if anything , should replace the draft . We are simply an ad-hoc group working for repeal , and if we 're going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try to embrace everyone who , for one reason or another , is opposed to the draft . Our list of sponsors now includes an Episcopal bishop , George 1Vald , a retired rear admiral , Mrs. Martin Luther King , Jr. , Dr. ; Spook , and a former speech writer for Senator Goldwater . We see three stages to our work in the coming months . Late next month , the Senate Armed Services Committee will hold hearings on the draft , and the first stage of our work will he directed toward these hearings . Later this year , we will work to elect senators and congressmen sympathetic to draft repeal . And then , early next year , we will lobby the new Congress to repeal the Selective Service Act . At the moment , we are giving qualified support to a bill already before Congress that was introduced by Senator Hatfield and cosponsored by Senator Goldwater and Senator McGovern , among others . This bill would establish a volunteer Army and suspend the draft . Eighteenyear-olds would still he required to register , but the process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congress . We 've come to realize what an important instrument of foreign policy the draft is . The draft makes escalation possible simply by executive decision , because the President has almost limitless manpower resources at his disposal . We 're supporting the bill because you must have a piece of legislation either to support or to oppose . The provisions of the Hatfield bill , by the way , are essentially the same as the recommendations of the President 's Commission on an All-Volunteer Armed Force  --  the so-called Gates Commission . " After another pause , Mr. Bristol said , " I am a Quaker myself , and a worker for peace . I was brought up as a Lutheran , and I went to a Lutheran college and then on to a Lutheran seminary . In 1935 , I was ordained as a Lutheran minister , and at that time I was a very conventional young man , and certainly not a pacifist . I was sent to what was then called a slum parish in Camden , New Jersey , and there , in the early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and **33;3787;TOOLONG , and also became a pacifist . I often think about my unfortunate parishioners , who had to live through my growing pains . In 1941 , I refused to sign m draft papers , and went to jail . If had signed them , I would have been automatically exempt as a clergyman . I had kept my congregation informed about what I was up to , and the day I was arrested I submitted my resignation . I was overwhelmingly moved when they told me they were n't going to accept it . So for the fifteen months I was in jail I was still technically their pastor . I tried to go hack to the Church after I came out , but that did n't work , so I left the ministry and joined the peace movement and , later , with my wife and children , the Society of Friends . " Cooking Lesson WE were ten minutes late for our noon-to-one-thirty all-male group-session Learn Your Lunch lesson at the Helen Worth Cooking School , which occupies a brownstone on East Thirty-first Street , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wintry garden , five men , two of whom had discarded their jackets , were sitting in small chairs facing Mrs. Worth . Each had a clipboard , bearing the day 's typewritten menu  --  wine consomiM. , chafing-dish chicken livers , medley of vegetables , and burnt pears in cream  --  with ingredients and instructions . " This is an Italian wine  --  Lambrusco , " Mrs. Worth was saying as we entered , and she held up a bottle of red wine . " Named after the grape . Should it he chilled or not ? " " Nut , " said one of the pupils , a big man who was wearing a lapelled waistcoat . " Well , the label says to serve it slightly chilled , " Mrs. W. said . " Does any one want to chill it ? " " No , " said the big man . " Well , I think it 's good enough to serve as it is , " Mrs. W. said . She handed us a clipboard , and we sat down with the rest of the class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different shapes . " Which is the Burgundy and which is the Bordeaux ? " she asked . " You can tell by the shape . " Several people answered this question correctly . " What 's good about a French olive oil ? " she asked . No one replied , and she said , " Its delicate flavor  --  sometimes . We 're using it , and some wine vinegar , in the vegetables . If you have red wine that has soured , you can keep adding it to the vinegar bottle . Pm sorry to say I never have any wine left over . " On a marble-topped work table in front of her she indicated a howl containing frozen cauliflower and artichoke hearts , and a tray that held a couple of cans of Campbell 's beef broth , a can of Blanchaud dried mushrooms , a clove of garlic , a bottle of minced instant onion , a bottle of Brown-Quick , and some bay leaves , tarragon leaves , and peppercorns . " These mushrooms are absolutely incredible , " she said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bouillon , but it 's actually consomme . Should herbs he bought powdered or whole-leaf ? " " Leaf , " said the man in the lapelled vest . " Smell these hay leaves , " Mrs. W. said , passing them around . Everyone sniffed . " Bay leaf comes from laurel , " Mrs. W. said . " What does tarragon taste like ? " No one answered . THE NEW YORKER " Licorice , " said Teacher . " Anise-flavored . You can use any herb with anti-thing if you like the herb . My favorite is savory . It 's a cousin of mint . Get summer savory , not winter . " She uncovered a glass dish of cut pears . " Burnt pears , " she said . " From a can  --  and are n't they beautiful ? Save the juice if you want it for gelatin . I got these vegetables out at eight o'clock this morning , and they have n't thawed . What 'll I do ? What 'll I do ? put them in the microwave oven for one minute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raw , most of them . Now Pm going to make the wine soup . " She proceeded to do so , in a pot over an alcohol burner , and she also began to cook the medley of vegetables . " Always use cold water for cooking , " she said . " Hot water stays in the pipes and is n't fresh . Oil should be stored in the refrigerator , or it gets rancid . Do any of you know about frozen turbot from Greenland P The supermarkets have it , and it 's good . The important part of learning how to cook is to season perfectly . You taste as you go along , but you are allowed only three tastes . After that , you have palate fatigue , and have to wait fifteen minutes . " Presently , after their quota of tastes , all hands sat down at a dining-room table for the soup , which was excellent , while Mrs. Worth sauteed the chicken livers . Several helpings were prepared in the chafing dish , some by the class . Next , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brown sugar . " Brown sugar hardens , and should he stored in a glass jar in plastic wrap , " Mrs. W. said . " It should he dark to he authoritative . Light-brown sugar is anemic . " Lambrusco flowed throughout the meal , which ended with coffee and Rumona , a liqueur blended from Jamaican rum . A young man who had been introduced to us as Edgar suggested mixing Rumona with brandy , and Mrs. Worth produced a bottle of Hennessy- . " Edgar is connected with Schieffelin , which distributes Hennessy , " she said to us . The class disbanded , but we lingered for a chat with the man in the distinguished-looking vest , who had been introduced to us as Sidney . " I 'm a veteran of this school , " he said . " f used to work for Time Inc. , and after that I wrote a whole series of novels , none of which got published . look after my finances , and play the heavy father . Pm president of the Salivation Army . We- go to 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Helen there . " He handed us an engraved card that read , " Sidney Hughes , jiggadicr Brindle , Salivation Army , " and we left . Film Orgy EST week was a busy one . We also attended a film orgy . The orgy , which took place at the Fahnore East , began at seven-thirty in the evening and continued until two in the morning . It was billed simply as " Film Orgy . " Ye got theie about eight , and stayed right through to the end , and from nine right through to the end we viewed . the proceedings from the front of the balcony , when Jon Davison and Joe Dante , the organizers of die orgy , had set lip two sixteen-millimetre movie projectors . Davison ran one of the projectors , Dante the other . Davison showed whole reels of had movies from the forties and fifties . Dante interrupted him with short takes from Isis reels , which were a potpourri of incredible things : Second World War W.A.C. training films , forties serials , newsreels , commercials , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really know how to put on a film orgy . They cut from one projector to the other with a good sense of timing and juxtaposition . " Hey ! " Dante said to Davison at one point . " We cut from ' Hercules ' to ' Ulysses ' and nobody noticed . " They told us they considered their material very funny . " At least , " Davison said , " it 's very funny to people who grew up in the fifties in front of a television set , and fortunately there are a lot of us , " We liked particularly a classic sequence from Abbott and Costello involving a search for the Susquehanna Hat Company ; a Diistan commercial in French ; one- of Alf Landon 's campaign films , which showed him going to church with his great-aunt ; and a nice speech by Ann-Margret supporting President Johnson 's Vietnam policy . We liked best a newsreel from the early fifties . First came a nationwide atomic alert with President Eisenhower ( and Cabinet ) scurrying for shelter . Next came a Miss Photog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Suez . Cana ! . Finally , there was fashion news from Dun Loper in Hollywood . We asked Davison and Dante what they liked particularly . They were proudest , they said , of an editing job they had done on a sentimental film about a boy who loses his dog . They had reduced the running time from two hours to two minutes . What remained in the edited film was the credits , one shot of despondent boy without dog , one shot of jubilant boy with newly returned dog , and " The End . "
